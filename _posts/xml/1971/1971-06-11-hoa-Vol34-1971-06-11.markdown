<p>The hon. member for Green Point, in the last speech which he made last night, referred to a speech made by the hon. the Minister of the Interior in which he described to the House his attitude regarding the issue of passports. The hon. member for Green Point then said that he regrets the attitude of the hon. the Minister which is one of &#x201C;take it or leave it&#x201D;. Sir, here we have a correct and a good illustration of the difference between the National Party on the one <span class="col_8795-8796" refersTo="page_1531"/>hand and the United Party on the other. The attitude of the National Party and of this Government is always: &#x201D; There are my principles; I stand by them or I fall by them; this is my policy; take it or leave it.&#x201D; The attitude of the United Party on the other side is as follows: The United Party would say; &#x201C;These are my principles; do not worry if you do not like them; I will change them.&#x201D;</p>

<p>*Sir, I want to come to an aspect of a speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. On a previous occasion this year when this House was discussing the Publications Control Amendment Bill, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said (col. 3373 of Hansard)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have already in the course of our speeches pointed out that we have one of the most rigid and most hide-bound censorship laws in the world and that we are much closer to the Russian model than to that of any Western country.</block>

<p>Sir, I now wish to ask the hon. member for Bezuidenhout across the floor of this House whether that is still his standpoint.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. Sir, the hon. the Minister of the Interior said in this House that because we were governing well, and because we wanted to govern well in the interests of South Africa, we welcome criticism provided it is fair, honest and constructive criticism. Sir, I am sorry that I have to say to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout from a back bench on this side of the House&#x2014;and I am fully aware of the fact that he is a senior front-bencher&#x2014;that he is irresponsible in his criticism. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is waging a campaign which is aimed&#x2014;and if it is not aimed at doing this, it can only have this result&#x2014;at blackening South Africa&#x2019;s name in the outside world. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout, if he wants to call himself a South African, should feel ashamed at the way in which he levels criticism in this House. But, Sir, that is not the end of the story. On that occasion, after he had said that, the following question was put to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Would the hon. member be so good as to produce proof of his statement that our model is close to the Russian model?</block>

<p>What was his reply, Sir? His reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I shall do so when we come to the discussion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, as he requested.</block>

<p>I was speaking about political censorship yesterday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Where is the proof that our censorship laws are closer to the communistic laws than to the Western model? Where is that proof? I want to tell the hon. member across the floor of this House that he did not produce that proof.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Show me a Western country which has political censorship.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is not for me to produce this proof. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that he would produce the proof. I challenge him: Where is that proof? He will have other opportunities to speak in this House. He can rise to his feet when I have finished speaking and produce that proof. Let him produce that proof, chapter and verse. But, Sir, that was not the end of his blackening campaign, because what happened then? A little while later he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want to reaffirm here that our model is much closer to the Russian model than it is to that of the Western countries. The hon. member can either accept it or reject it. If he knows anything about what happened to writers such as the author of Dr. Zhivago, he will already know that we are much closer to that model than to that of the Western countries.</block>

<p>Sir, what was he implying here? Surely this is a mean and base kind of denigration.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>As it pleases you, Sir. I withdraw them. Sir, the hon. member for Carletonville then reacted and said to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout: &#x201C;You do not know what you are talking about,&#x201D; and that is the opinion one must form of that hon. member. He does not know what he is talking about. Sir, I want to give you an idea of how this type of thing is taken further. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout's henchman, who writes under the name of Hogarth de Hoogh, the hon. member for Kensington, took this matter further the following Sunday in the column of which he is the co-editor, and wrote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Japie Basson, United Party frontbencher. touched the Nationalists on a raw spot on Tuesday when he suggested that South African censorship was closer to Russian censorship than to Western censorship.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Tripe,&#x201D; they yelled, &#x201C;prove it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help here. To begin with, the role of the Publications Control Board in South Africa is remarkably similar to that of Russia&#x2019;s Glavlit.</p>

<p>Glavlit&#x2019;s job, officially, is to preserve the ideological purity of party and public from contamination by alien ideas.</p>

<p>Then he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surely no supporter of the Publications Control Board would disagree with such a lofty aim?</block>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington and the hon. member for Bezuidenhout know that no censorship or control is being exercised on a basis of what is good for the National Party; but control is being exercised over publications on the basis of what is good for South Africa. The political faith and the political premise of any writer in South Africa is irrelevant as far as the Publications Control Board is concerned.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister of the Interior illustrated this very clearly here yesterday. I want to state unequivocally here that the <i>Sunday Times</i> is dealing with lies here, and not only with lies, but with denigration of the worst kind. We on this side of the House are not opposed to criticism. We said this a moment ago, and so did the Minister, But we do not want this type of denigration. We do not want this type of image-building which is unworthy of any news media in South Africa. It is quite simply an irresponsible denigration, and is devoid of any facts. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout did not produce any facts which could form the basis of this. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that he would produce proof. He did not do so, but what he said had its effect. He levelled his criticism, criticism which was unjustified and of which he was unworthy. He is a real &#x201C;hit and run artist&#x201D;. He hit and ran. He did not hit and stand his ground and prove that he had been right in doing so. He is a hit and run artist and that is what the United Party is to an increasing extent becoming, together with the English press. It is a hit and run party. They mete out insults and level criticism, but when that criticism is analysed to the bone, they run away, and when you want to engage them in battle, they are simply not there. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria Central is yet another one who has joined the long list of people in his party who believe that criticizing the Nationalist Party is unpatriotic, and I think if one sees it in this light one will have a good idea of his basic philosophy.</p>

<p>There is just one other thing I want to say. This Committee can test that hon. member. It is about time he was brought to heel. He mentioned an article in the Hogarth de Hoogh column in the <i>Sunday Times</i> in his speech a few moments ago, and he stated to this Committee as a fact that I had written it. Now, I would not have minded having written it&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>This is where we put that hon. gentleman to the test, and this Committee and this House will know from now on how much veracity can be attached to his words. So far he has mentioned four articles which he has stated specifically in this House were written by me and I can tell him that I wrote not one of them. I had no prior knowledge of them and the first time I knew anything about them was when they appeared in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I think from now on this House and this Committee will know exactly how to treat the hon. member. [Interjections]</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order!</p>

<speech by="#oliver">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. D. G. OLIVER</person>:</from>

<p>I go so far as to say that even his pet newspaper. <i>Hoofstad</i>, had to correct some of his wild allegations. I do not propose to waste any further time on this hon. member.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. member for Waterkloof, who last night dwelt at length on what he called &#x201C;the royal prerogative of the State&#x201D; in refusing passports. With his own impeccable logic he said that the position was that passports are refused and that is that. That is as far as he was prepared to go, and he felt that the matter should be left there. In fact he seemed to suggest that once the Minister had decided not to grant a passport. no further discussion should be brooked. Unfortunately he himself was a little late in the field, because the hon. the Minister had gone much further than he did in a previous speech he made. The hon. the Minister gave us eight reasons why passports are not granted. I must say, in passing, that we are grateful indeed to the hon. the Minister for having gone so far. Now for the first time we have been able to take just a little peep behind this hitherto impenetrable curtain masking what goes on in the department. Looking at these eight reasons, which I have had an opportunity to study now, one sees that they can be divided into two broad sections. The one section of reasons, consists of what are in this country criminal offences. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister, if he has information of this sort and uses it as a reason for refusing passports, why these people who were refused passports for those reasons were not prosecuted. And I want to ask him whether he can tell us in all conscience that in the case of Alan Paton or Athol Fugard any one of these eight reasons could fairly be applied to that case. I suggest that not one of these reasons could be advanced for refusing the passports. I suggest that much the same happened in the case of Laurence Gandar, the former editor of the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, who also was refused a passport. Subsequently of course it was granted to him, but not one of these eight reasons could conceivably have been applied to him.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to another matter dealing with the Government Printer. On a number of occasions during the last few years we have suggested to the Government that it is wasting public funds. Government members have tended to challenge us to come forward with examples of this wastage of funds, which we have done. I want to come to another example this morning. I want to suggest that in one field of enterprise which falls under the Government Printer, considerable sums of money are being spent which are of no benefit cither to the public or to the Government. In the years I have been in Parliament, either in the Press gallery or in the Chamber, I have seen a marked change in the nature of the official publications put out by the Government Printer. Some have been improved for the most merit-worthy reasons. Publications aimed at distribution abroad should be glossy and well turned out, and even a publication such as <i>Paratus</i> of the Defence Department should, I think, be a well turned out publication. But by the same token I see no reason whatever why we should be confronted now with what can perhaps be best described as a rash of glossy, multi-coloured publications which have been introduced now to supplant the old Blue Book, the annual reports of the various <span class="col_8801-8802" refersTo="page_1534"/>Government departments and Government agencies. These are printed, of course, under the authority of the Government Printer, although from the Estimates it appears as though funds are recovered subsequently from the departments concerned. Nevertheless, the Estimates charge the full cost of the printing against the Government Printer, who falls under this hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Let us take, for instance, the annual report of the Department of Sport and Recreation for the year 1970. According to this publication, 1 040 copies were printed at a cost of R1 300, or approximately R1-25 each, Now for whom were the 1 040 intended? hon. members of this House each get one free, as do hon. members of the Other Place. A good number are distributed to newspapers, to libraries and to other interested destinations, and one can assume that a limited number are actually sold at the local listed price of R2-20. One can ask immediately what the people who receive these reports do with them. For the most part those who receive them are interested in them only as working documents. For my part, I would much prefer to work with a concisely produced and easy to read report produced rather faster than some of these reports are produced without the expensive frills and fancy bits that we see in this report. I would like to see such a report costing perhaps a third or even a quarter of what this one costs.</p>

<p>We can go to some other reports. I have here the report of the Secretary of the Department of Public Works. Nine hundred and fifty copies of this report were printed at a cost of R1 500, which means that each copy costs R1-58. Those are the printing costs alone and they do not include other costs of production. I suggest that that is quite shocking. We certainly do not need this type of cover, which would do justice to and could well grace the glossiest of the international, horticultural magazines. What I would like to see, would be the contents of this report produced speedily, clearly and simply. I suggest that we do not need these pictures or anything like that.</p>

<p>In the little time available to me, I want to draw the hon. the Minister's attention to another report, namely the report of the Statutory Committee of Education Heads. The actual print order of this report is not giver. but the costs was only R270. I think the Committee will agree that it is quite a presentable document. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>A few days ago I accused the hon. member for Kensington of writing articles attacking his political opponents in the newspapers under a non de plume, which I and all decent members of this House of course regard as despicable.

<p>It is common knowledge in the Press gallery that the hon. member does do it.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a despicable action because he is attacking his political opponents under a nom de plume in a newspaper when they cannot reply to him. That is despicable. There is no complaint against any hon. member continuing his profession as journalist. The hon. member for Yeoville has all these years continued his profession as journalist by writing articles in newspapers, but under his own name. There will be no objection to the hoc. member for Kensington writing articles attacking his political opponents in the newspapers, if he did so under his own name. Then we know whom we are dealing with. But I say that it is most despicable if the hon. member writes articles attacking his <span class="col_8803-8804" refersTo="page_1535"/>political opponents under a nom de plume when they do not get an opportunity of replying to the attacks,</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am asking the hon. member for an assurance that he does not do that and that I am wrong. [Interjections.] I cannot be more fair than that. I am telling the hon. member that, if I am wrong, I am prepared to apologize to him. If the hon. member does not give that assurance, we accept that he is guilty of doing that. It is not a question of specific instances.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>One cannot make specific allegations when the hon. member does not even sign his name. As I have said, if the hon. member is prepared to give the assurance to this House that I am wrong, I am prepared to apologize to him. If he does not give that assurance, he is guilty of that despicable action.</p>

<p>Everyone will then brand him as a man who has not the courage to attack his opponents when he has the opportunity across the floor of the House, but who makes use of anonymity in a newspaper to attack his political opponents, when they cannot reply to him. The hon. member has the opportunity and he can deny that if he wants to.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Kensington referred to those publications by the Government Printer in an extremely negative way. He is being extremely negative in wanting to disparage such fine publications in this House. He may perhaps be right in the respect that many of those publications are printed for local use. But some of those publications go to the outside world as well, where they are read by other people. Those publications are not written under pseudonyms. They are publications of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>No, I do not want to listen to your questions. Sometimes these publications also contain a photograph of the author. The reason for that hon. member's objection is not the excellence of those publications, but the fact <span class="col_8805-8806" refersTo="page_1536"/>that some of them are given out on contract by the Government Printer and that payments are made to concerns to which he is not favourably disposed. That is the reason.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to raise a matter in connection with the removal of the Government Printing Works to Koedoespoort with the hon. the Minister. I think it is a good thing that an undertaking such as the Government Printing Works should be housed in proper premises and should be situated in a light industry area and have spacious and comfortable working conditions. I think it is necessary for the Government Printing Works to move there when the lime comes and the premises are ready, but I want to ask that provision be made for a depot or something of that nature to be retained for the Government Printer in the city centre for the sake of all those who have to fetch publications in the office of the Government Printer daily and from hour to hour. I am thinking in particular of the vast number of attorneys, auditors and other professional firms in the city who continually require publications from the Government Printer. I am also thinking of members of the public who wish to obtain some of those publications. I therefore want to ask that provision be made for a depot in the city where publications by the Government Printer can be obtained. I think this is necessary and will be convenient. To my mind it would be a convenient place for the Government Printer as well and would eliminate correspondence in particular.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>My dear fellow. if I had written in newspapers then I would at least own up to it. I would not have had to resign from being a journalist because I was not one. The fact of the matter is I do not.</p>

<p>I should like to speak on the question of the annual volumes of the statutes which ceased to be published by the Government Printer after 1967. Until that date, we always had annual volumes which had very useful information in them, not only as to the contents in alphabetical order and so forth, but also information relating to the date of commencement of an Act and. amendments of various other Acts. It was a useful and very important publication. Since then there has been no publication of any volumes of the annual statutes. We here are privileged to have an annual volume which is prepared every year and which is really just a collection of the <i>Government Gazettes</i> put into order with an alphabetical index and a chronological index. The reason for this apparently is that the Government has made a contract with the firm of Butterworths for the publication of the consolidated statutes which appear in red volumes under various headings. There is no reason at all. it seems to me, why the Government Printer should not continue to publish annual volumes as they were published before. To the lawyers particularly this is extremely useful and very necessary. I am sure all the hon. legal gentlemen on the other side will agree with me that it is necessary to have the annual volumes of statutes.</p>

<p>When one examines the statutes to find out what the law means, one likes to know what the law was at that time when judicial decisions have been given in respect of it. One finds one&#x2019;s way around better as a lawyer with the annual volumes than one does with Butterworths. The Government is hung up on Butterworths because it has made a contract with them for these consolidated statutes. The difficulty about Butterworths is that they are not consolidated in the form of an Act passed by this Parliament. If they were, then even if mistakes were made in the consolidation it would not matter, because that would then be the law as passed by this Parliament. But this is a consolidation done by the firm of Butterworths. They get help from legal people and other people. It is not gospel. One occasionally finds mistakes in Butterworths. There is a judgment of the Appeal Court of South Africa relating to a statute published in Butterworths, which the Government has contracted with to publish the statutes instead of publishing them in the form in which they were published formerly&#x2014;indicating that what appears in Butterworths is wrong. It is not a reflection of what Parliament passed: it is not the law. This is an unfortunate state of affairs. It is a state of affairs which <span class="col_8807-8808" refersTo="page_1537"/>naturally can occur where you have the human element coming in through someone trying to consolidate the laws from the various statutes. Since 1967, you will find Butterworths everywhere. You will find them in every magistrate&#x2019;s court and in every Native Commissioner&#x2019;s court right throughout the country. This is what they have to rely upon in order to determine what the law is, because there is nothing else, and as I have said, it can be wrong. For example, in the case of the first Bill which appears on today's Order Paper, dealing with judges&#x2019; pensions, one would find great difficulty, when using Butterworths, in trying to discover where the law was that was being amended by this Bill. There is no reason whatsoever why the annual statutes should not continue to be published as before. It can involve the State in no expense whatsoever. One can, for example, say that the annual volume shall only be available to those persons who apply for it beforehand.</p>

<p>He is just looking at the wrong Minister.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I am looking at the hon. the Minister of Justice, but that is only because the Minister of the Interior is hidden behind a pillar. If the Government Printer is going to publish these volumes in any case, he might as well publish more of them As I understand the printing business, you can publish 1 000 copies for almost the same price as 300 conies. I may say that there is least a secure market for these volumes. I would not mind if it were for example laid down that those who subscribe to Butterworths should be entitled to have them, if the contract the Government has entered into with Butterworths necessitates something of that nature. Otherwise one could say that those who subscribe to the <i>Government Gazette</i> should have such an annual volume. You could charge people for such a volume, and members of the profession would pay for it. because they need it. As I understand it an arrangement has been entered into between the Government Printer and the legal profession whereby the Government Printer has agreed to provide anyone who wants them with the printed statutes as they appear in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> Practitioners can then have these statutes bound themselves if they wish. I understand, however, that this arrangement costs as much as it does to be a subscriber to the <i>Government Gazette.</i> and if you are a subscriber to the <i>Government Gazette</i>, you receive these printed statutes anyway.</p>

<p>Sir, this is a very important aspect of one's life. One is presumed to know the law and ignorance of the law is no excuse. It is very difficult to know what the law is, and it is in fact dangerous to rely entirely on Butterworths, as I have indicated. This is not only my own opinion. The Appeal Court has expressed the same view.</p>

<p>In this regard too. I wonder whether the time has not arrived when the regulations made in terms of Statutes should not also be published by the Government Printer in a concise form. This could be done in a loose-leaf volume. Very few of the laws which we pass do not have a provision that the Minister or the State President may make regulations in relation to that Act Where does one find these regulations? Very often it is impossible, without some guidance, such as that provided by Butterworths or other companies, to find regulations which are made by the departments. They appear in the <i>Gazette</i> from time to time, but they are very difficult to find. Some of them go back many years. It is difficult even for a lawyer to find these regulations, and the public, who are subject to these laws and are presumed to know them, find it almost impossible to track down these regulations The regulations are known to the various departments. Whenever one consults a department, one is told exactly when the regulations were published and what they are. The departments know exactly what the regulations are which concern them. It will therefore not cause any difficulty if we ask every department to publish the regulations applicable to them. They can then be given to the Government Printer, who can sell them, perhaps in a loose-leaf form. He could make a profit on the sale of those regulations. I am sure that not only the lawyers, but also the public in general, <span class="col_8809-8810" refersTo="page_1538"/>would buy these regulations. I think this is a very important matter, and I feel that this can easily be done. I hope that the hon. the Minister who has now taken over this portfolio will give this matter a fresh look. This matter has been mentioned before, in the old days, to other Ministers, but I hope that this Minister will give the matter fresh consideration. As I have said, I think it is an important matter as far as the law and as far as the public is concerned. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the first place I should like to reply to what the hon. member for Kensington said about the publication of annual reports by the various departments. His objection was that the departmental reports were excessively decorative, etc. He even objected to certain photographs appearing in them. He then came to the conclusion that the ordinary Blue Book form used in the past would cost less whilst still containing the same information. I should like to furnish an explanation in this regard because the hon. member raised the matter under the Government Printing Works Vote. According to State policy, because the Government printer cannot cope with all the Government printing work himself, the departments channel their advertisements and some of their publications through the Government printer. In some cases the Government printing works do the printing work themselves. and in other cases not. However, the departments themselves place the orders. In other words, the hon. member could have asked under each specific departmental Vote why the department in question incurred certain costs in respect of their expenditure. The different expenditure appeared under the different revenue Votes. The Government printer is in this case simply a channel acting as a factory, to put it like that.</p>

<p>An amount of R1 000 for example is still a lot of money, but one must see it against the background of all the Government&#x2019;s functions. An amount which is spent in this way to make a report attractive could perhaps bring a department a far better return because it led to people reading that report. We all know how people throw publications aside because they are not attractive and therefore do not arouse interest. That is why advertising techniques are being used. These matters are, however, in the hands of the various departments. This entire matter forms part of the modern dynamic era in which we are living, and the various departments must decide for themselves what they are going to do. In addition, there are differences among the departments, I may say that the Government printer as such, as a factory which undertakes this work, does not really have any say in this connection. Unfortunately I cannot say more than that in reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s objections. There are some Government departments, such as the Defence Force and the Public Service Commission that channel their orders through the public service. With them the matter of publicity is important, because they must recruit their staff. Their contracts are channelled through the Government printer. For example, contracts were negotiated through them with the firm Van Zyl, Schultz, Lunt and Tredoux. They spend tremendous amounts every year, and I think that it is money well spent.</p>

<p>Why <i>is</i> he then concerned about that hon. member? If the hon. member does not want to listen, it is his business. In any case, I think he is capable of listening with either ear. Be that as it may, I should like to announce, as far as this building is concerned, that we are all concerned because we are having some considerable difficulty with the storage of Government stores in a satisfactory and efficient way. We have now reached the planning stage of that building, and as recently as two months ago the Department of Public Works informed me that with the preparation of sketch plans, working drawings, quantity lists and a tender period we could expect the documentation of this R13 million complex at Koedoespoort to be completed in approximately 53 months, and after that the construction work will begin in about 1975. Sir, I listened to the hon. members representations for a depot in the city. I can understand the practical problem because it is quite a long distance, and we should give attention to an idea like this. I shall give it my attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North was concerned about the publications in that particular form which is only available to a limited number of people. As he knows of course, the publications, in the form in which they are normally effective, are available from the Government printing works. He advanced the argument that it would not cost very much more to print a few hundred more. Very well, this is a matter to which one can give attention. Unfortunately the Government printing works is not able, with the manpower and the machinery at its disposal, to do all the printing work expected of it. The printing work given out on contract has increased from an amount of approximately R1&#x00BD; million in 1967 to R2 872 000 in the 1970-&#x2019;7I financial year. But there have been renovations of the Government printing works, particularly of machinery. We have good prospects with this new building complex, and ideas such as those raised by the hon. member here, are ideas to which we shall give our attention.</p>

<p>He can chip in with as many witticisms as he likes; it does not affect me; I am simply trying to reply to him. I nevertheless undertake, even though he is trying to make a minor point here, to bring what he mentioned here to the attention of the Government printer, but everything will depend on what is within the capacity of the Government printer as such within the next year or two.</p>

<p>Sir, I should very much like to express a special word of appreciation to the Government printing works and to the former Government printer and the present Government printer, because these people, as a factory which has to do work for the Government, which also has to channel work for the Government, is one of the most efficient we have in South Africa, if not the most efficient. These people are doing a monumental task, and they are doing it at a very low unit cost, one of the lowest unit costs you could find anywhere. That is why I think it is a good thing that our people will know that very hard work is being done here in a Government department where efficiency is the order of the day. I also want to mention that although there was concern about the storage of stores, there is less concern in this regard now, because it was possible to make certain arrangements with the Department of Defence to leave more space for us, through their moving elsewhere. The buildings which had no locks, have also been seen to. The position has been improved, and as far as the Government printing works is concerned, I can mention that the staff position during the past few months has improved to such an extent that there is no real major problem with staff in the Government Printing Works.</p>

<p>Sir, I had no intention of participating in the debate again. Yesterday I referred to the question of political censorship, and I also discussed it under the Vote of the Minister of National Education. But we had such an outburst from the hon. member from Pretoria Central here, that I just want to say a few words to him. In the first place I want to say that we are not at all interested in his kind of attacks on the &#x201C;denigration&#x201D; of South Africa. It is a well-known fact in this House that if a man does not have enough facts to enable him to deal with a case on its merits, he comes along with silly remarks like this. In any case, he or <span class="col_8813-8814" refersTo="page_1540"/>anyone else for that matter can go on doing that; it runs off our backs like water off a duck&#x2019;s back. We will not allow such people to dictate to us what we regard as being in the interests of our country.</p>

<p>Why did we get this terrible outburst from the hon. member? All that I said was that our system of censorship was closer to the Russian model than to that of the Western countries. The hon. member could have tried to prove that this was not the case. I shall give him the proof of this but I did think he had enough intelligence to accept as proof the speeches I have already made. Everyone knows that in Western countries certainly those I know about there is no political censorship. The truth of the matter is that in the leading Western countries no censorship is even applied to communistic literature. That we do not want. I am very much, and our side is 100 per cent, in favour of censorship in respect of all communistic propaganda; but the Publications Board goes further. We go so far in our country as to ban material which is critical of the political policy of the Government. Sir, use is made of a section in the Act which one does not find in any other Western legislation. The section which is used, provides that a publication may be deemed to be undesirable if it or part of it is &#x201C;harmful to relations between any sections of the inhabitants of the Republic&#x201D;. As it stands here it sounds all very well, but it is applied in such a way that books which are critical of the Government&#x2019;s policy are banned. Yesterday I mentioned here the example of Alec Hepple&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Verwoerd&#x201D;, Sir, there are books in this country which were written about Gen, Smuts. The hon. member must read a book like Armstrong&#x2019;s &#x201C;Grey Wolf&#x2019; where Gen. Smuts is made out to be a heartless tyrant. But did the United Party ever think of banning such works?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, so i can go on and mention numerous other books. I have been following the lists faithfully since 1965, and because I myself am somewhat of a collector of political works, I have found that a book sometimes stands on one&#x2019;s shelf for two to three years and is then banned. I can mention examples of this. I have done so already here in the House. There is, for example, Bernard McKay&#x2019;s &#x201C;Africa in World Politics&#x201D;, and Gwendolin Carter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Independence in Africa&#x201D;. I have read these books. They stood on my shelves for two years and then were suddenly banned. I must say that most of this banning was done under the old Censor Board when a man like S. E. D. Browne served on that Board. This is the kind of thing which is going on. Sir, the system in Russia is that every writer there is a member of an official Government-controlled writers&#x2019; circle and if he should write something offensive to the Government of the day, he is simply banned from that circle and all his books are automatically banned. We have something like that here in this country.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that there is no political censorship of any kind in the Western countries. They go so far that they do not even ban communistic material. Consequently I am fully entitled to say that our system is closer to the Russian system than to that of the Western countries. If the hon. member wants to prove that I am wrong, let him do so. Yesterday I made an appeal to the hon. the Minis er to go into this matter, and I am certain that he shall do so. There are already signs of a slight improvement, but I think it is a matter which he might as well raise with the Publications Board again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised an interesting matter this morning, but I am not going to devote the time at my disposal completely to that.

<p><span class="col_8815-8816" refersTo="page_1541"/>Yesterday I availed myself of the opportunity to try to lay down and explain, as I saw them, the four or five important cornerstones of what I regard as the nascent policy of the Department of the Interior. I feel only one important matter was left in abeyance, and that was the question of the Public Service. Yesterday evening I indicated that I should like to see the Public Service as such divorced from the matters we had discussed up to now, and I feel that it is my duty as Minister of this department to say a few things about it.</p>

<p>There were, particularly in the past year, many new developments to which attention should be drawn and which call for a special compliment to be paid to the Public Service Commission and to the Public Service itself, The Public Service Commission is a section of the department which, as you know, is often criticized.

<p>If the hon. member should want to avail himself of the opportunity on a later occasion, I personally would appreciate it,</p>

<p>I was discussing the Public Service and the Public Service Commission, and now I come to the question of the salaries of non-Whites and the ratio between White and non-White salaries, which is an extremely important matter. It is becoming an increasingly important matter in our whole set-up in South Africa. But before I come to that, I have here a short list which I regard as unique achievements of the Public Service in recent years.</p>

<p>By way of comparison I just want to say that it is my personal belief&#x2014;on the basis of the little I have read of Public Services in recent times&#x2014;that we in South Africa are very fortunate. This is the impression I have gained. Not only do we have few signs of rebellion, opposition and dissatisfaction in our Public Service, but we tend to move in the opposite direction, for example, as regards the strikes which occur in certain countries. We in this country have had the offer from our Public Service that they would work an additional hour per day. This was criticized by people outside and it was said that this was in fact a very small contribution which was being made by the public servants of South Africa. But as a matter of interest, I want to mention that this means on the basis of the 270 000 public servants we have in South Africa, that we are receiving an additional 3 million manhours from our public servants free of charge. On behalf of my department and I, I want to praise them on this occasion and say that we greatly appreciate this concession from their side, that we particularly appreciate the many thousands of manhours they are giving us in the form of overtime, and that I would be grateful if the appreciation would be conveyed to the Commission itself.</p>

<p>A survey was made of 20 of the largest companies in South Africa in order to determine exactly what the contributions were of their staff towards semi-State bodies and private bodies. It was found that with the exception of one out of 20. the Public Service was putting in the largest number of working hours per man in the country. This is a very interesting fact to remember and we should appreciate this, especially in the light of the concession already made Furthermore, we are finding that outside institutions are requesting more and more aid from the Public Service in regard to the methods we are using at present. Some of the biggest companies, even in Cape Town in the past two months, have asked me and the Public Service Commission for guidance in regard to what methods we are in fact using in various aspects of the Public Service. I want to mention this because I think it is worth-while doing so.</p>

<p>What are the results of this? Over the past five years an inspection plan was carried out which is unique in South Africa as far as the Public Service is concerned. A total number of 805 major investigations were carried out in this time. The Mechanisation <span class="col_8817-8818" refersTo="page_1542"/>Group alone, which was established in 1962, carried out 1 453 investigations in this period. This is unique. This was the first time anything like this has happened. The Work Study Group carried out</p>

<p>I 404 investigations in the past five years. Furthermore, in this time the Commission succeeded in bringing about a direct and indirect saving of 20 800 posts which were unnecessary in the Public Service. Success was also achieved in saving R34 million as a direct and indirect contribution to State funds. Training under the bursary scheme led to the granting of 6 079 bursaries in 100 different directions, and already more than 2 000 people who were trained under the scheme are in our employment. At present we have 2 155 candidates for bursaries. I am mentioning this not in order to waste time by quoting long lists of figures here, but just because I feel that we should try to see these matters in the right perspective. I really believe that our Commission is doing what it can.</p>

<p>We have sent teams overseas and in the past year we opened a recruiting office in London; and the number of resignations from the Public Service was lower last year than over the past five years, especially as far as men are concerned. This is a good sign. This means a great deal to the Public Service in its struggle with the private sector. if I may put it like that. Actual recruiting we have extended to six different offices in South Africa which are undertaking this work at the moment. This enables us to carry out on the spot investigations. In addition we have established a new publicity division, something which is completely new in South Africa and which has led to much higher productivity than what we had before.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In the few minutes I have left, I wish to deal with a matter which is of greater direct importance at present, and that is a matter which was raised by several hon. members during the debate&#x2014;the question of the relationship between White and non-White salaries. I want to say immediately that the position is not entirely satisfactory. I am prepared to agree to this. As Administrator of Natal, I always took the point of view that the position is not satisfactory as it is at the moment, and that we should try to make further improvements. At the moment nearly 50 per cent of all the members of the Public Service are non-Whites, i.e. 130 000. This means that, in effect, one must crystallise a particular position for them in relation to the remuneration paid to our Whites who have been in the Service a longer time. This has become a major factor in the relationship between the Whites and non-Whites in South Africa. There is not only a difference, but at times there appears to be a growing difference in ratio in certain categories. In other cases the ratio has improved over the past years. The position has got to the stage that I have decided, with the support of the Cabinet, to refer the whole matter to the Public Service Commission again and to ask them for a comprehensive report on the whole question. I want the commission to give us a report and an insight into what can be done to bring about a more satisfactory position in the White-non-White ratio in this regard. I am not only referring to the Coloured teachers, of whom my colleague, the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs, spoke yesterday, but the whole field.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Minister a question? With regard to the fact that a survey is to be undertaken which will obviously be a lengthy process, could not steps be taken in the interim at least to restore the ratios which were lost, for instance, in the medical services between White and non-White doctors?</p>

<p>We have put the terms of reference given to the commission for its investigation, very widely. I personally and others have already had interviews with members.</p>

<p>They could be handled under interim regulations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, this is one of the problems I have put to them, I think that this is a matter which must be investigated by the commission. They may come back to us and suggest that in certain cases, which seem to deserve more immediate attention, something be done in the interim. This is a factor we will take into account. The whole investigation will however take time, as hon. members will appreciate. The work cannot be completed in a matter of months. It would be unfair of us to create the impression with any of our non-White groups that everything will come right overnight. This is not possible. It cannot be done in a limited period of time. In order to establish in modern times a satisfactory basis for remuneration between the various sectors <span class="col_8819-8820" refersTo="page_1543"/>of the population, it will require a most difficult and scientific investigation by the commission. I want to say to hon. members that the impression has been created by certain sections of the Press that very little has been done so far and that we have, in fact, widened the so-called gap between Whites and non-Whites with regard to salaries.</p>

<p>May I say that&#x2014;before my time&#x2014;the Government over the last ten years has taken a number of steps which have improved the position of the non-Whites considerably. I have them all listed here, but I am not going to weary hon. members this morning by telling them what we have done. Briefly we have rationalized the whole salary pattern, which has resulted in substantial increases as far as White and non-White people in the Service are concerned. It is interesting to note what has been done with regard to specific groups. The non-White medical and teaching personnel have been singled out for better benefits from the 1st April, 1969, as hon. members know. I might mention that in the case of medical officers, which is a pertinent matter which is brought to our notice from time to time, non-Whites have since then been remunerated on the same key salary scale as White officers. This is something to remember. Furthermore, the post structure and staff provision scales for Whites will apply to Coloured and Indian teachers, resulting in salary improvements, Tanging from 10 per cent to 43 per cent. I think that if we stress the positive side of what has been done, it will go a long way towards improving the relationship between the Whites and the non-Whites. Apart from this we have increased vacation savings bonuses and the rates of overtime remuneration. There have also been improved pension benefits All this took place in the past few years. However sympathetic the Government is. it must not be expected, in view of the financial responsibilities which may ensue from an investigation of this nature, that it can ignore its responsibility towards the taxpayer and the economy of the country. No snap decisions can be taken. The task is a very complex one which may take a long time.</p>

<p>Salary determination has become a highly specialized task. The establishment of a specific ratio is an important point which is often raised by the United Party and the Press of South Africa. But establishing a specific ratio pattern would probably mean discarding all the accepted principles of salary determination. From my point of view, this is important too. What does rational determination involve? In the first place, quality is taken into account. It is one of the cornerstones of rational salary structure. Remuneration must in the first place be based on quality. Other universally accepted criteria for salary determination are the following&#x2014;and this comes from international works on the subject. It has not been born in South Africa or in my mind. These are accepted universally as the criteria which should form the basis for the establishment of different scales and ratios. Firstly, apart from quality, there is the level of responsibility in the case of the man who does the job. Secondly, there is the job content, thirdly the work circumstances, fourthly the qualification requirements and then the socioeconomic needs, the future prospects offered by the post structure and the supply and demand for workers. Then there is the question of the availability of funds which should be shouldered by the authorities.</p>

<p>I can give hon. members the assurance in the light of what the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs and Planning has said, that it is the intention of the Government, bearing all these factors in mind, to try and develop a salary structure based on such principles and to make adjustments gradually as circumstances dictate. I think it should be placed on record that this is the full and correct approach of the Government to this particular matter. Granting of higher salaries as such and the creation of improved posts will not immediately solve the problem because of the simple fact that the tempo at which these people can qualify themselves is a very slow one.</p>

<p>I should just like to mention one more point in connection with the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>*This point concerns the inquiry into the activities of the Public Service Commission and the Public Service which was requested by some members in the course of this debate. A few months ago I indicated very clearly that it was not possible for the Government to accept these requests from the Public Servants Association, the Opposition and its Press in South Africa. There are many reasons for that. Because of the lack of time, I am not going to give you the reasons. The most important of these is perhaps that if such a step were to be taken, the State President would be obliged to appoint a commission of inquiry <span class="col_8821-8822" refersTo="page_1544"/>into a commission he himself had appointed. This is a <i>sine qua non.</i> They simply cannot be reconciled with each other. The one cannot be done by the other. In 1924 the commission of inquiry was not appointed by the Governor-General. This was not the case in 1918 either. One cannot go further by insisting on that.</p>

<p>If I had sufficient time, I would gladly have replied to all the points raised by the hon. members. However. there are a few important points to which I should reply.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Green Point raised the question of an improvement in subsistence allowances and the matter of the payment of leave gratuities. I can give the hon. member the information. It will interest the hon. member to know that since 1968 a thorough investigation which is now nearing finality has been undertaken in regard to the question of allowances. Proposals in this regard will be submitted to me in perhaps a matter of months. However. provision already exists that where subsistence allowances are inadequate, officials can claim if they wish to do so. There need therefore be no loss. An investigation was undertaken into the question of leave gratuities a few years ago. It was found at the time that very few public servants forfeited leave due to their retirement. As the result of this request by the Public Service Association all departments were requested to submit further details in this connection. These details are at present being analysed to determine whether any amendment to the existing provision is necessary.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That was the request from the Association in 1970?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Durban Central raised the question of the removal of teachers from the Public Service Commission. There are several objections to that. One of the major objections is, of course, that the doctors and scientists want this as well. If we are going to start removing groups from the Public Service, we shall reach a position which has already been reached in France, and that is that virtually half the servants have been removed from the Public Service. The determination of the remuneration of those outside groups makes it extremely difficult for those who have to remain in the Public Service. In addition, I may tell the hon. member that at the present time the teachers of South Africa already have a series of benefits which other public servants do not have. This is one of the reasons why I personally cannot support this standpoint at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District, who is not present at the moment, referred to two different investigations which had been instituted in the past. He mentioned them, because the hon. member is not present at the moment, I shall not reply to that. Two inquiries were instituted, but the hon. member was somewhat confused about this matter. It was not a single inquiry, as the hon. member thought. It was not the same inquiry which had not been published as yet. The first has done a considerable amount of work up to now. The second is a commission of officials appointed in 1970. They will make certain recommendations in this regard before long. It may interest hon. members to know that the first commission recommended that the Cabinet Committee appointed to carry out that investigation, was not the body which could best perform that task, but that that body was in fact the Public Service Commission itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>There is no need for the general registration to coincide with the date on which the supplementary registration ends. To arrange matters in such a way that a supplementary registration will be the general registration as well, requires a statutory provision. The hon. member may discuss this matter with me later. I shall be able to tell him what the possibilities are in this regard.</p>

<p><span class="col_8823-8824" refersTo="page_1545"/>In the last place I want to come to the replies to the various points raised with regard to the question of visas, passports, etc., points which are unrelated to the principles I dealt with yesterday. Unfortunately the hon. member for Houghton is not present at the moment, and I wonder whether I should not leave the points she raised. However, I just want to reply to one point she made which will interest hon. members as well, and that is why we granted a passport to Mr. Venter so that he could go overseas while the possibility existed that he, too, could be involved in this Agliotti inquiry.</p>

<p>As a contrasting example, she mentioned the case of Fugard where we had refused to grant him a passport. In the first place, I want to say that we had no knowledge of Mr. Venter&#x2019;s action in this connection. The Department of the Interior had no indication that he was involved in this matter. I do not know the man at all. We do not have the opportunity of taking action against persons of whom we know nothing. He received a passport before the inquiry had been completed. In the second place, I want to say that I withdrew Agliotti's passport after I had learnt who he was. At the moment he is without a passport. I think it is important that hon. members have this information. There is no indication that he or Mr. Venter are necessarily guilty of any malpractices. It was done in the case of Agliotti and it would probably have been done in the case of Venter if we had reason to think that he. too, was also involved in this matter in some way or other.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Two or three months ago I learnt about the case, who he was and that he had a passport. It was then withdrawn.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District spoke about the question of naturalization and asked why more could not be done in order to naturalize the large number of immigrants entering the country. I just want to tell him that these details are published quarterly. But at the moment the hon. member is not present either, and so I shall leave that point as well. The hon. member also asked how we encouraged people to become South African citizens, but seeing that he is not present at the moment, I shall not reply to that now.</p>

<p>Various questions were also put with regard to the electoral laws. I just want to say that we are working on two different matters as far as the electoral laws are concerned. We are considering the question of simultaneous elections. In addition, we are considering another series of possible amendments to the electoral laws which will be submitted to this House in due course. The co-operation of the United Party in this regard will be requested before the time.</p>

<p>I am pleased the hon. member for Durban Point is here. He and I opposed each other in elections in the past, so I know him very well, as he knows me. For that reason I am sorry he sunk to a low level in this debate by saying the things he said here. This is something we should try to avoid when we are discussing Votes of this nature. He spoke about a person who had approached him. someone who had thought he no longer wanted the woman to whom he was married, to put it tactfully. I leave the question of colour on one side.</p>

For that reason we could not give the hon. member a reply. The Department of the Interior does not have police at its disposal and therefore had to ask another department to assist this voter of the hon. member.

I have treated the hon. member with all possible courtesy and I gave him all the information he wanted. However, he sigled out one thing that went wrong during the six months he has been here and brings it to the notice of this House in an endeavour to create the impression that we do not know what is going on in our department.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sea Point raised the question of the &#x201C;Other Coloureds&#x201D; as a matter which was of importance to them. This has been the accepted position since as far back as 1967. I do not want to go into all the details now, although I have them here.</p>

<p>&#x2020;I just want to state that Proclamation 123 of 1967, provides for the classification of Coloured persons into certain ethnic and other groups. This was accepted by practically all these groups. These groups are: the Cape Coloured Group, the Malay Group, the Griekwa Group, the Chinese Group, the Indian Group, the other Asiatic and the other Coloured groups. Those groups living outside of the Coloured area in the Cape do not wish to be associated directly with the Cape Coloureds. It was a case in Natal which led to this matter being publicized in the newspapers. I have them here, if the hon. member wishes to see them. The matter was rather exaggerated and presented in a different light.</p>

<p>*If there are hon. members who have points to which I should react, I shall do so with pleasure. Thank you very much for your co-operation which has made it possible to dispose of these matters so expeditiously.</p>

<p>We have four new subheads under this Vote. We are not surprised to find these items on the Supplementary Estimates. We dealt very fully with the subsidies that will now be given to the provinces in terms of the Second Financial Relations Amendment Bill passed by this House. It is therefore really pointless to have any further discussion on this matter, except to say that we on this side of the House do hope that the new system will not interfere in any way with the autonomy of the four provinces, but that we will allow them to expand according to their own thinking and own needs and that the Government will always be mindful of the fact that decentralization is part of our form of government and that nothing will be done to interfere in any shape or form with the powers of the provinces as they presently exist.</p>

<p>Sir, actually I only want to reconfirm what I said in this regard. It is my conviction&#x2014;and I think this becomes very apparent from the White Paper&#x2014;that under the old set-up, which is now coming to an end, the Minister of Finance actually had more scope for interfering, if he wanted to interfere with the autonomy of the provinces, than is the position at present. I think that on that point I can therefore reassure the hon. member completely.</p>

<p>The Cape Provincial Administration, in its Budget requirements <span class="col_8831-8832" refersTo="page_1549"/>which were placed before the hon. the Minister for the current year in order that this subsidy could be established, included in it certain grants-in-aid. This raises the fundamental question which arises from debates which we have had previously and from legislation which has been approved, particularly amendments to the Financial Relations Consolidation Amendment Act of 1945 this year: to what extent now does the public look to Parliament, to the Minister, for the justification of expenditure by way of grantin-aid by the provinces? In the ultimate it is now the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility and no longer the responsibility of the provinces to determine these grants-in-aid. I do not think there is one of us who is not concerned about the argument or the dispute which is proceeding in the press at the present time in regard to the activities of Capab, the Performing Arts Board in the Cape Province. Included in the figures which have been approved for the Cape Province this year, is a subsidy of R1 350 000 for the Performing Arts Board &#x2014;for both Capab and Kruik. One realizes, Sir, that a subsidy of this sort is not a paying proposition and one never intends it to be. We on this side obviously do not question the granting of subsidies for the promotion of the arts. It can never be a paying proposition and because it cannot be a paying proposition, it becomes all the more important, as I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree, to see that the subsidy is properly handled and properly expended. I do not at this stage want to raise the merits with regard to this matter but there have been suggestions that there should be an inquiry into the management of Capab and Kruik, and my question to the bon the Minister is, where does that responsibility lie? After all, the decision in principle is a decision of the Administrator; it is a decision of the Administrator-in-Executive, but the very thing against which we warn, and that is that the legislation that we were considering earlier this year affected the autonomy of the provinces, arises not in the principle of the subsidization, not in the question of the amount of the subsidization, but how that money is spent. Sir, where does the responsibility lie? I do hope that the hon. the Minister will indicate whether in subsidies of this sort it is for the Administration to decide what it wants to spend, is that then accepted at face value by the Ministry; or is the position that the Administration must justify to the Minister the details of the expenditure concerned. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will indicate where the ultimate responsibility lies to see that the money is well and properly spent,</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am not in a position to discuss the position of Capab, The only indication I can give at this stage, is that under the new set-up the Cape Provincial Administration is considerably better off than it was under the old set-up, but at this stage I do not have any information in respect of Capab at my disposal.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, perhaps I have not made myself clear. There is an indication that some inquiry is needed; I am not going into the merits, but who is responsible? Is the Minister responsible for seeing that the money is properly spent, that it is not wasted, or is it the responsibility of the Administrator? How do we apply section 6, of the Financial Relations Act which this House passed, on the Government&#x2019;s recommendation, without the Minister having to bear responsibility for the manner in which the money is expended?</p>

<p>The position is that once the standard expenditure and the standard revenue and the consequent subsidy have been determined according to the formula, the provinces have every right to decide how they are going to spend that amount, out of their own revenue plus the subsidy. They are not bound by the calculations that were made in terms of the formula.</p>

<p>Sir, I find it astonishing that the hon. member for Green Point has now raised this matter here. He made the vague statement that &#x201D; there have been suggestions for an inquiry&#x201D;. I find it astonishing that he started casting suspicion here on the good management of the Capab enterprise of the Provincial Administration, whilst he himself is one of those who is a champion of virtually absolute autonomy for the provinces. Surely, as an ex-M.E.C. and an ex-member of the Provincial Council he knows very well that the Capab administration falls under the control and administration of our Provincial Administration. After all, he knows very well that the Cape Administrator him <span class="col_8833-8834" refersTo="page_1550"/>self is the honorary chairman of this organization. He did not tell us on what grounds there had been suggestions for an inquiry to be carried out. Is it because of Capab&#x2019;s maladministration of the funds, or is it because Capab has been presenting certain productions which are not to his taste? He did not tell us why there had been suggestions for an inquiry to be carried out. I see no reason why this House should interest itself in the matter on the strength of either of these grounds. The administration of the finances of that enterprise rests fully with the Provincial Administration and with Capab&#x2019;s executive, on which responsible members of the Provincial Council are serving and supervising the proper and correct spending of those funds. If the suggestions for an inquiry are based on the standard of the programmes, I think that it is not the function of this House to comment on that either, except if we were to do so because we felt that the Publications Board should have investigated the mailer. Sir, I really do not understand why the hon member for Green Point raised this matter here, for as far as we are concerned, we vote the money; we grant the amount of R1,3 million, and in passing I may just mention that the amount of R1,3 million is also intended to pay for the hire and the use of the Nico Malan Theatre; I think the hon. member will grant me that. A part of that amount is intended for the hire and the use of the Nico Malan Theatre. We vote the money, and it is not for us to exercise control over the Provincial Administration and to say that an amount of 10 cents was misspent here and that an amount of R100 was misspent there. We accept that that body is fully equipped and able to exercise proper control over the money they receive from us for that purpose.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Bellville&#x2014;I do not know whether he has done it deliberately&#x2014;has completely missed the point. The whole point here is that we have been asked these past few months to vote certain moneys to certain departments for them to carry on the business of those departments. Here we are being asked to vote certain moneys to provincial councils for them to carry out their business. But with regard to the other departments, this House has the final control over the expenditure of that money and those departments report back to this House on the expenditure of that money. Now, the question raised by the hon. member for Green Point is: Who controls this money? He raised the issue of Capab merely as an example. If Press reports are to be believed, this is a typical example for the Deputy Minister to take cognizance of. If we are going to vote this money, should we not have control over it? This was the point which was raised during the debate on the Bill. Are we going to control it, or is the province going to control it? If we are being asked to vote the money, we must control it. Of course we find ourselves today in this peculiar situation that the Cape Provincial Administration yesterday closed off its Budget session. Yesterday it voted certain moneys to be expended during this coming year, including the Rl,3 million referred to by the hon. member for Bellville. But where did they get the money? They have not got the money, because we have not voted it yet. What happens if this House today votes this amount down? This is the position which was explained to the hon. the Deputy Minister when we discussed the Bill. This is the principle and this is the question which the hon. member for Green Point has put to the hon. the Deputy Minister. How is this expenditure controlled? Are we going to control it, or the Provincial Council? [Interjections.] This is the question which has been put pertinently to the Deputy Minister, and we have had no reply.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>I am astonished at the hon. member for Pietermaritzbuig District, for obviously his whole argumentation amounts to his views being in direct conflict with those of the hon. member for Green Point; for the hon. member for Green Point and the hon. member for Parktown were concerned about the autonomy of the provinces. In fact, in his introductory comments the hon. member for Parktown said he believed that the new set up would not have the effect that this Parliament would interfere with the autonomy of the province. What does this mean? Obviously it means that the province also has the autonomy to spend the funds voted in terms of this legislation for the purposes for which the province wants to spend them. But now the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is very concerned about who is going to exercise control over these funds, which are now being voted to the province. Now I want to ask the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District this <span class="col_8835-8836" refersTo="page_1551"/>question: What is he advocating? Is he advocating that this Parliament&#x2026; [Interjections.] Oh, Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Salt River should rather take some salt, for his comments are very insipid. But I want to know from the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District what his point of view is. Once these funds have been voted for the province by Parliament, does he want the province to have control over the spending of those funds, or is he advocating Parliamentary control over the details? In reply to the hon. member for Bellville he said that here in the provincial estimates an amount of approximately R1&#x00BD; million was voted to Capab, and he wanted to know who was going to exercise control over that expenditure? From that I can only infer that the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District actually wants to make the plea, by implication, that we ourselves should take over the autonomy of the provinces in respect of the control over the expenditure of funds in terms of this legislation. That is what he said. Now, hon. members should settle this matter amongst themselves. Who is really the persons who is propagating the valid standpoint of the United Party? Is it the hon. member for Green Point, or the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District? But what is important to me, is that although those hon. members are the apologists for the provincial system, and although the hon. member for Parktown said that decentralized government was part of our form of government, not one of them came forward to express their sincere thanks for the province being enabled to carry out effectively the services for which it is responsible in terms of the Act. Not one of them is prepared to say that the norm which is being determined in respect of financial assistance to provinces, is no longer determined by the means the province happens to have at its disposal, but that the Government is now prepared to grant the province funds in accordance with the needs of the community in the province concerned.</p>

<p>I want to warn the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District against saying things by implication. If the amount of R711 million is granted to the provinces, he must state unambiguously to whom he wishes to give the control over the spending of those funds. Does he want to give it to this Parliament or does he, in accordance with the standpoint taken by the hon. member for Parktown and the hon. member for Green Point, want to vote these funds to the provinces and allow them to spend these funds under their own control, at their discretion?</p>

<p>I want to make a second point. I am astonished at the hon. member for Green Point raising the question of Capab at this stage, for he is actually the hon. member opposite who ought to know how Capab functions, because he has an advantage over the other hon. members on the opposite side, namely the fact that he served on the Executive Committee of the Cape Province. I can only infer that he is not prepared to say what the real situation is. He claimed that there was a suggestion of an inquiry into Capab&#x2019;s activities. After all, he knows that in the Provincial Council his party came forward with a real motion of urgent importance on Capab&#x2019;s activities, and why is he keeping quiet about it? The only inference is that he is keen to dissociate himself from what was done by his colleagues in the Provincial Council. Secondly, he has been keeping quiet about the facts because, I think, he does not want to furnish them. For the hon. member is aware that the board of Capab, which is nominated by the Minister of National Education, is an independent board, and that it obtains its funds from, <i>inter alia</i>, four sources. Firstly, it obtains its funds from the Central Government in the form of a direct subsidy under the former Department of Cultural Affairs, now known as the Department of National Education. Secondly, he knows that the various provincial councils vote certain amounts to their performing arts from their own funds; thirdly, that certain local authorities grant funds to Capab, and, fourthly, that Capab obtains funds from revenue which it, in turn, obtains by way of admission fees. Therefore, it is important that, in referring to Capab and to the voting of funds, we should actually take cognizance, with appreciation, of the edifying work done by our cultural organizations. But, no, it is in keeping with the general pattern displayed by the hon. members opposite for suspicion to be cast on everything which is done in our country by the Government or by the provinces. It is therefore not astonishing that their deputy leader in the Provincial Council started a boycott movement in respect of the opening of the Nico Malan Theatre. That, in turn, is in keeping with the dualism which <span class="col_8837-8838" refersTo="page_1552"/>we find among hon. members opposite on every occasion, namely to enjoy the benefit on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to disparage and besmirch.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L.G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>If I can ask the hon. member for False Bay to listen, because perhaps he was not listening when I spoke originally, I will come back to the problem I raised which has resulted from the legislation which this House has passed.</p>

<p>I have asked the Deputy Minister to tell us so that the country can know and we can know what the position is as the result of this legislation in regard to the control of certain expenditure. We have made our position clear and it remains clear that we believe in the autonomy of the provinces, it is for this reason that we opposed various aspects of the legislation. But this grant now that we are asked to approve is in terms of the new section 6 of the 1945 Act, and I want to read the final words of subsection (3)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For the purposes of subsection (2), a province&#x2019;s financial requirements&#x2026; shall be determined by the employment of such expenditure criteria and such revenue criteria as the Minister of Finance may determine after consultation. I</block>

<p>I raised the matter of Capab, of the Performing Arts Board, as an example of an organization which will receive a subsidy which has been approved in principle by the hon. the Minister, because he takes the final decision as to the financial requirements of the province. Quite correctly, when the question was raised in the province as I have read the newspapers, I do not know the details of the debate&#x2014;it appeared that an inquiry was necessary into the management of that organization. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, if the ultimate responsibility is his, must the request for an inquiry be directed at him or, having approved of an overall sum of money, will the decision of whether or not an inquiry is to be held be in the hands of the province? I have asked that question pertinently, because it high lights what we were concerned about when discussing the legislation earlier, namely that the whole approach resulted in a diminution of the autonomy of the provinces. I hope and have hoped that the hon. the Deputy Minister, who is handling this matter, will stand up and say that how this money is spent, once it has been approved, is in the hands of the provinces. The only time the hon. the Minister would be concerned, would be when he consults with the Administrator concerning the Budget for the next year. He could then ask the Administrator if the subsidy should be changed. According to a letter of criticism in the newspaper concerning what is being done, it is suggested that there is a degree of incompetence and that there are wrong doings, criticism Jed by one of the M.E.C.s himself. I want to raise a simple question: Does the responsibility remain, as I would prefer it to, with the province or is the hon. the Minister now concerned because of the amendment to this Act?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District is upset because he has not yet been given a reply in regard to the point he made, whereas the Budget of the Cape Provincial Administration has already been finalized and this House is being requested to vote the money. To my mind this is really not as important as the hon. member wants to suggest. What would the position have been if this new set-up had not come into operation? He attributed this to the new set-up which had now come into operation. In that case these subsidies would not yet have been voted either. The Appropriation Bill has not been finalized as yet. In other words, these moneys have not been voted either. I assume that the Cape Provincial Administration has reasonably good grounds for accepting that this Parliament will not break its faith with the province. The same situation probably cropped up on many occasions in the past. Over all these years this Parliament has accepted obligations in respect of the financial position of the provinces. Therefore, I think that the provinces have every right to accept that Parliament will meet that obligation.</p>

<p>As regards the other matter that was raised by the hon. member for Green Point. I have now obtained more information in regard to Capab. information which I unfortunately did not have at my disposal earlier on. The position seems to be that the Department of National Education has a certain measure of control over Capab in the sense that it exercises control over the Performing Arts Board. The position is that the amount of R1 430 000 was voted on the Vote of the Department. On its <span class="col_8839-8840" refersTo="page_1553"/>part the Cape Provincial Administration also makes a contribution to it. In other words, there is a kind of joint control as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to obtain certain information from the Deputy Minister of Agriculture in regard to the amount of R7 million under sub-head O, which is described as a contribution to the Wool Commission in respect of the stabilization of the price of wool. This is the first time we have been afforded an opportunity of discussing this amount. I should also like to know from the Deputy Minister whether this amount represents half of the supported price, which was determined in order to increase the price of wool to 28c. Is this a corresponding amount paid to the Wool Commission to cover all their activities in regard to the stabilization of wool, or is it concerned with wool purchased by them? In other words, how was this amount of R7 million determined? I appreciate that this is a final amount for this particular financial year, but we should like to know how it was calculated. I think the supported price paid to farmers at the moment, over and above what they are already being paid in order that the price may be increased to 28c, emails expenditure amounting to approximately R15 million. The Minister indicated that the Government was going to be a full partner this year when it came to the stabilization of wool, and it is not clear to us whether this amount of R7 million represents half of the total supported price, or whether it is going to be granted to the Wool Commission in regard to all their activities, to spend as they deem fit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London City is correct. The amount which the Government had in mind, was calculated to bring, along with the contributions made by the Wool Commission, the average price of wool up to 28c. The hon. member will know how quickly the Wool Commission&#x2019;s funds were exhausted. The Government said that it would act as a partner in this regard, and the contributions would be calculated more or less, but not exactly, on a 50-50 basis. We may not act on the assumption that the State is going to contribute exactly 50 per cent, for the next wool-clip may be a rather small one owing to circumstances. Therefore one cannot work on the basis of a definite amount. Having regard to all these facts, the Government felt that R7 million, along with the amount which the Wool Commission was going to contribute from its own funds in order to ensure this stable price, would be adequate. However, it has not been laid down exactly how this amount is to be applied. I assume that it will be applied in such a way that the producer will fetch an average price of 28c.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>It relates only to the Land Bank. It is in respect of the amounts they have allocated to co-operatives, etc. The hon. member will remember that R10 million was granted at a certain rate, and that this amount was later increased to R15 million, to cover the erection of silos, etc. Funds have to be obtained from the private sector at rates varying from 8 to 9 per cent, and those rates are then subsidized by this interest equalization contribution.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I regret that the hon. the Minister of Tourism is not present. One would have thought that the Minister concerned with this Vote would have taken the trouble to be present. I have no option but to put my question to the Minister of Finance. A supplementary amount of R273 000 has to be voted in respect of the membership fee and a contribution towards the expenses of the Southern African Regional Tourism Council (SARTOC). At this stage we do not know at all what SARTOC is. We do not know how many countries are involved here and we do not know which countries are involved. We do not know whether this is calculated on a percentage basis or not. I shall be glad if the Minister of Finance can give us the information in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister of Tourism could not be present this afternoon. On his behalf, I should like to give the following information: This particular amount has resulted from the ministerial conference on regional tourism in Southern Africa, which was held in August last year. At this conference it was decided to create a body known as the South African Regional Tourism Council (SARTOC). The object of this council is to promote tourism in all ways in Southern Africa. I think hon. members will agree that it is a very desirable object and that all countries in Southern Africa who want to co-operate in this field should become members of the council and contribute towards it on a cooperative basis in order to promote tourism in every possible way. I do not think I could give the final list of the members concerned, but it affects all the countries close to us in the Southern Hemisphere. The names I have here include Botswana, Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius. Mozambique. Rhodesia, South Africa and Swaziland. Possibly Malagassy could also be included. The matter has not yet been finalized. We know that some of these countries have not yet accepted membership and others may still in the future become members. The countries I have mentioned are expected eventually to become members of this tourist organization. I could read the terms of reference, the ideals and objects of this council to the House, but I think they will be clear to hon. members. The council&#x2019;s object is to promote tourism.</p>

<p>The funds required by this organization will be derived from its members, as well as other funds they may procure. A formula has been calculated according to which the funds are to be obtained. Fifty per cent of the annual budget of the or-organization are to be spread equally amongst the various member countries, and the other fifty per cent has to be paid in by the various countries on the basis of their gross national product. The organization has not yet been in existence for a full year, so that they do not know exactly what the costs are going to be, but we feel that if the total costs of running the organization are in the region of R&#x00BD; million, South Africa&#x2019;s contribution, based on the formula I have mentioned, will be approximately R273 000.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to thank the Minister for the information he has given us at this stage, but I notice that this amount is in respect of the membership fee and a contribution towards the expenses of SARTOC. I accept that as far as the membership fees are concerned, all countries are in a similar position, and that they will all pay the same membership fee, but what is the position as far as the contributions are concerned? Does this amount represent a contribution from the Republic of South Africa calculated on a percentage basis?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>No, I thought I had explained the position clearly. The percentage contribution is for membership. I said that the cost of running the organization will be in the region of R&#x00BD; million. Now where is that R&#x00BD; million to come from? The R&#x00BD; million has to be contributed by the member states according to the formula I have already described. South Africa is, of course, financially speaking, the strongest of all these countries. Half of the cost of running the organization is distributed on an equal basis, and the other half on the basis of the gross national product of the various countries. That is the cost of membership, which we contribute to the organization for carrying out its duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, here we again have the usual &#x201C;piebald Bill&#x201D; which marks the end of every session. It is generally known as the &#x201C;omnibus measure&#x201D;. It does not contain only one principle, but quite a number. Consequently I feel myself obliged to explain the various clauses to hon. members.</p>

<p>The provisions of sections 2 and 2 <i>bis</i> of the Indians Relief Act, 1914, which are being repealed by means of clauses 1 and 2, relate to the registration of marriages in accordance with some or other Indian religion or, as generally referred to, Indian faith marriages. As hon. members know, the registration of such marriages entails that a lawful marriage is established between the parties, from which all the consequences follow which follow from an otherwise lawfully recognized marriage. It is a fact that Indians have always shied away from the Western form of marriage because of the complicated procedures preceding such marriages with which they were unfamiliar. With the amendment of the Marriage Act, 1961, by the Marriage Amendment Act of 1970, in which provision was made for the simplification of the solemnizing of marriages, our procedures are now more acceptable to the Indians. Consequently, there is no further reason for the continued existence of these sections and they may be repealed. An additional factor is that with a view to the recompilation of the population register, which will also include the marriage register. and the contemplated introduction of the identity document for which provision was made in the Population Registration Amendment Act of 1970, only one procedure will be followed in the registration of marriages. I may add that the repeal of the provisions in question have the support of the Indian Council.</p>

<p>Clauses 3, 4, 5 and 6, result from a recommendation made by the Borckenhagen Committee, which recommendation, as has already been announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance during his Budget speech on 31st March, 1971, has been accepted by the Government, i.e. that the State accepts full financial responsibility for the therapeutic services in regard to communicable diseases. As we also announced at the time, this will entail an additional payment of approximately R1&#x00BD; million per annum to local authorities. At present local authorities are subsidized in terms of the National Health Act on a basis of seven-eighths of the approved net costs of the services in question.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 7 makes provision for an expansion of the provisions of section 115 of the National Health Act to include objects which are not at present covered by the section. It was recently disclosed that certain imported articles intended to be used in the preparation or serving of foodstuffs contained harmful elements to such a degree that they constituted a health hazard. Owing to the limited scope of the section as it reads at present it is necessary to expand the powers conferred by the section.</p>

<p>The laws mentioned in clause 8 are being repealed because the provisions there <span class="col_8845-8846" refersTo="page_1556"/>of have been included in other laws. In this connection I refer hon. members to the Advanced Technical Education Act. 1967 (Act No. 40 of 1967); the Advanced technical Education for Indians Act, 1968 (Act No. 12 of 1968) and the Associated Institutions Provident Fund Bill (VW. 30&#x2019;71) which was introduced this session.</p>

<p>Section 10 of the Iron and Steel Industry Act, 1928, provides that the Board of Directors of the South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corporation Limited or&#x2014; as it is generally known&#x2014;Iscor. may raise a loan not exceeding a specified amount by the creation and issue of debentures in order to make provision for the moneys required for the capital expenditure of the Corporation. In addition, section 10 <i>bis</i> provides that the Board may, with the approval of the State President, raise further loans by the creation and issue of debentures. Owing to the scope of the Corporations' activities and the extent of its capital requirements. it is necessary to enable it to consider other forms of acceptable loan offers. This is being done by means of clause 9.</p>

<p>As far as clause 10 is concerned. Sir, section 6 of the Liquor Act. 1928, already makes provision for various exemptions from the holding or application for licences in terms of the provisions of that Act. In this way, for example, any person who on the authority of the Minister of Defence or the Commissioner of Police or the Commissioner of Prisons sells liquor in a specified place to the members of the Defence Force or the Police Force or the Prisons Department, is thus exempted. Owing to the closed activities of the Bureau of State Security, it is also desirable, as far as liquor facilities for its members are concerned, to establish separate facilities for them and for those in their company. In addition it is also necessary to make shopping facilities, similar to those which members of the service departments receive today, available as a fringe benefit for its members. In order then not to make a distinction between those who operate liquor or shop facilities for the benefit of the members of the other existing institutions and those of the Bureau, it is necessary to confer on it the same privileges in regard to exemption from licence fees, and so on. Exemption from licences under the Liquor Act is being granted by means of clause 10. As far as a shop of the Bureau is concerned, I refer hon. members to clause 28. The provisions of that clause coincide for the most part with the provisions of section 149 of the Defence Act, 1957, section 29 of the Police Act. 1958 and section 88 of the Prisons Act, 1959.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 11 is being effected to prevent an evasion of the provisions of section 14 of the Motor Carrier Transportation Act, 1930. That section prohibits any person from transferring to a vehicle other than the vehicle referred to therein, or ceding to another person, a badge or motor carrier certificate issued by the National Transport Commission or a local road transportation board, without the consent of the Commission or the local board in question. Now, sometimes it happens that existing companies holding motor carrier certificates to convey passengers and goods are taken over by persons simply through the acquisition of shares in such companies. The National Transport Commission and local road transportation boards can do nothing to control or to prevent the position. This clause now makes provision for the necessary powers of control. I can just mention that the amendments do not create a new principle. A similar provision already occurs in section 17 (5) and (5) of the Air Services Act, 1949 (Act No. 51 of 1949), in regard to the allocation of air transportation licences.</p>

<p>The amendments in clauses 12. 13 and 18 give effect to a recent announcement made by the Minister of Labour during the discussion of his Vote, i.e. that as from 1972. Republic Day, will be an annual paid holiday for all mine and factory workers instead of only every five years.</p>

<p>As far as clause 14 is concerned, it sometimes happens that access to the records of a court may be desired for research purposes. In magistrates&#x2019; courts such access can only be obtained on payment of the prescribed fees&#x2014;which amount to 30 cents for every 100 records. Since access to the records of a court for research purposes entail the rendering of services of a less general scope by the court officers in question, and since the research is intended for academic purposes, researchers are, in terms of this clause, being exempted from the payment of the prescribed fees.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 15 results in an expansion of the membership of the Public Accountants and Auditors Board. As is provided in paragraph (a) of the clause, the person who is appointed shall be a person resident in the district of Johannesburg, <span class="col_8847-8848" refersTo="page_1557"/>or an adjoining district. The reason for this is that the bulk of the activities of the Board take place in Johannesburg and there is a considerable work-load on the two members in the Board appointed by the Transvaal Society. Consequently the Board has requested that an amendment be affected as provided in this clause. The amendments in the rest of the clause and in clause 16, are of a consequential nature.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 17, confers upon the Controller and Auditor General the powers to proceed with the auditing of the accounts of certain bodies in the Territory, such as the Meat Trade Control Board of South-West Africa and the Dairy Industry Control board, whose functions relate to scheduled matters as referred to in the South-West Africa Affairs Act, 1969. The reason for this is that in the light of the 1969 Act to which I have just referred doubts exist in regard to the validity of certain statutory provisions of the Territory which entrust the powers of auditing to the Controller and Auditor-General. This amendment now establishes the position beyond any doubt.</p>

<p>As far as clause 19 is concerned, as hon. members know, no female may perform any work at night in connection with the operations of a mine unless she holds a responsible position of a manageress or of a technical nature, or renders medical or health services, and so on. Owing to the shortage of competent manpower which is being experienced, provision is being made in this clause to grant exemption from this prohibition to a mine or industry in cases where special circumstances warrant it. In the main the provision corresponds to section 54 (1) (a) read in conjunction with section 19 (1) (e), of the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act, 1941.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Before business was suspended, I was explaining the different clauses and I had disposed of clause 19.</p>

<p>Clause 20 is intended to expand the powers, as referred to in section 89 of the Defence Act, so as to prohibit as well the admission of persons to any place on or in which armaments are being manufactured or repaired or on or in which any function of the Armaments Board or the Armaments Development and Production Corporation of South Africa, Limited, is being carried out.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 21 will exempt a divisional council from being required to pay the costs in connection with any alteration or removal of telephone routes which is necessitated by any roadworks by such a council. In the other provinces the provincial administrations are not liable to pay the costs in connection with telephone route alterations or removals which are necessitated by their roadworks. Since a roadwork which a divisional council undertakes in the Cape Province would in the other provinces be undertaken by the provincial administrations, the distinction thus made in regard to costs between the administrations and divisional councils is being eliminated by this clause.</p>

<p>Clauses 22 and 23 are self-explanatory. In the light of the fact that the pension benefits of various groups are improved from time to time, and in the light of the fact that the salaries of officiating judges have been increased considerably since 1st January of this year, it is felt that an increase in the pensions payable to judges who retired prior to 1st January. 1971, as is provided in this clause, is justified. I can just mention, Sir, that an increase in pensions of judges was last effected in 1968.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 24 is to provide for situations for which provision is not at present being made in the Community Development Act, 1966. In terms of section 15 of that Act, the Community Development Board is competent, with the approval of the Minister of Community Development, to make payments in respect of any goodwill value which may be attached to any profession or business which is likely to be lost as a result of the person carrying on that profession or business having to cease carrying on that profession or business in consequence of any proclamation under the Group Areas Act, or any steps taken under that Act. Now it sometimes happens that a person is not necessarily obliged as a result of such a proclamation to cease carrying on his profession or business because he is a member of the group to which the proclamation refers. It also happens that subsequently, under the Community Development Act, the property of such person in the group area in question has to be expropriated with a view to <span class="col_8849-8850" refersTo="page_1558"/>urban renewal and resettlement of the area. The persons in question are then obliged to close their business and vacate the premises so that the building can be demolished and the area replanned. Such owners then lose their goodwill value in that they have to cease carrying on their profession or business, not as a result of the proclamation under the Group Areas Act, or as a result of steps taken under that Act. but as a result of the fact that they have to cease carrying on their business or profession in consequence of steps taken under the Community Development Act. The Community Development Board is consequently not competent to make payments in respect of any goodwill value lost as a result of the fact that the person in question had to cease carrying on his profession or business. The amendment in paragraph (h) of clause 22 will cover the cases I have mentioned. As regards the amount which is paid for the lost goodwill value, the basis of calculation is being brought into line with section 38 of the Housing Act, 1966, which was amended during this session of Parliament. As regards the payment of compensation to the person who ceases carrying on his profession or business in a group area is concerned, as a result of expropriation under the Community Development Act, the most beneficial calculation on the basis mentioned in the clause is made depending on whether the highest net profit was made before the date of the proclamation in terms of the Group Areas Act or prior to the date on which such person ceased carrying on his business or profession as a result of expropriation under the Community Development Act. The provision is being deemed to be with retrospective effect as from 1st April 1969. because expropriations have since that date been made in terms of the Community Development Act. which could have resulted in deprivation.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 25 results in an expansion of the matters with regard to which regulations may be promulgated in terms of the Arms and Ammunition Act, 1969. This expansion is necessary to keep the particulars which have to be included in the essential firearms register correct and up to date, and to control the transportation of arms and ammunition, particularly to remote areas.</p>

<p>Sir, the Rehoboth Investment and Development Corporation and a burgher company have already been exempted by section 6 (1) of Act 84 of 1969 from obtaining the consent of certain bodies to acquire immovable property or an interest in immovable property in the Rehoboth Gebiet. Now, in addition, it is also being required in terms of the statutory provisions to which reference is made in clause 26, that each certificate of registered title shall contain a condition that no alienation, hypothecation, lease or other encumbrance of land in the Rehoboth Gebiet may take place unless the consent of certain bodies have been obtained. To make the exemption which is already granted by section 6 (1) of the Act to the Corporation effective, the amendment in clause 26 is being effected.</p>

<p>The amendment in clause 27 will confer on the Rehoboth Investment and Development Corporation powers in regard to the provision of accommodation for its officials and employees. As employer the Corporation must compete on the labour market with private enterprises and bodies which do in fact offer these fringe benefits and conditions of service, and in South-West Africa in particular the provision of housing and housing benefits us of special importance, This also brings the rowers of the Corporation into line with those of the Coloured Development Corporation and the Bantu Investment Corporation.</p>

<p>As far as the amendment in clause 29 is concerned, a proclamation was issued on 11th June, 1948. in terms of which the Constitution of the Kakamas Labour Colony was substituted. In paragraph 18 that Constitution provided that settlers and plot-owners could under certain circumstances receive ownership over their plots and building sites. In terms of section 19 of the Constitution every deed of transfer was however subject to certain conditions effected by way of notarial agreement against the title deed of the property in question. In 1968 paragraph 19 of the Constitution was repealed by Proclamation No. 214, as a result of which the transfer of sites was no longer subject to the conditions mentioned therein. The Management Board of the colony resolved that consent would be granted, unconditionally, to cancellation of conditions endorsed before 1968 to every owner who made application. However, to effect such a cancellation, the owner must enter into a further agreement with the Management Board which has to be registered the Deeds Office. The amendment <span class="col_8851-8852" refersTo="page_1559"/>in clause 29 will eliminate such a cumbersome procedure and unnecessary expense for the owners in question.</p>

<p>The transitory nature of one&#x2019;s presence in this House makes me feel that I ought not to use the word &#x201C;historic&#x201D; in describing this occasion, but it certainly is, in my time in this place, a most remarkable occasion to have a General Law Amendment Bill to which we have no objection whatsoever, a General Law Amendment Bill which furthermore has clauses in it dealing with BOSS to which we have no objection whatsoever. Indeed, there is a provision that nothing in the Liquor Act relating to the application for or holding of licences shall apply to the canteen which the members of BOSS are now going to enjoy. I am sure that this will he welcomed by the members of BOSS and I am sure that they are going to be very happy that there is no cause whatsoever for the Police to make any sort of investigation in regard to carrying on this canteen. The only difficulties they may have is identifying the persons who are entitled to enjoy these privileges to each other. But that is no real difficulty. We are in fact very glad to see the amendments to the Public Health Act in terms of which the local authorities, for the services they perform in terms of that Act, will now receive all their expenditure and not, as it was before, only a part. We are pleased that the provisions relating to the canteens are there, as they should be in respect of any other service. We are delighted to see that the judges who retired before the new benefits were available are to receive an increase and we are very gratified to see that the Government is following our advice in regard to arms and ammunition. But lest you think. Sir, that I am in a state of euphoria, let me say in conclusion that it is about time these things were done.</p>

<p>Clause 11:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is one to which we do not object, in so far as we do not intend to vote against it since the logic of the argument given in favour of this amendment is something with which one cannot quarrel. But it is a symptom rather than a cure which is being dealt with here. The evil to which the hon. the Minister of Justice referred, but which is really a matter for the Department of Transport, is a symptom of dissatisfaction with the present provision. Therefore people try to evade the provisions of the existing Act. They attempt to evade it because of the method of application, the attitude of the Railways in its objections and the attitude of the commission in issuing certificates to carriers. The result is that we have here, by legislation, created something which has led to an illegal business. It is like I.D.B. Carrier certificates are like diamonds. They are like gold. Carrier certificates are something which cannot normally be come by in the ordinary course and so people resort to any subterfuge which they can in order to obtain by subterfuge what they are unable to obtain directly and as a right. I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister, whom I know is the one who deals with this aspect, whether this clause, which is now being introduced and which will be passed, is not justification for a complete review of the whole Act which we are being asked to amend. This clause is fundamental to the problems which arise from the application of the Act. People who presently follow a common practice will now become criminals if they continue with that practice, because they will be prevented by this amendment from obtaining ownership of companies and thereby obtaining ownership of carrier certificates. In the light of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s recognition of the problem and what it leads to, I want to ask him to consider going into this whole question during next year or during the recess and perhaps appointing a commission or referring the matter to a Select Committee of this Parliament. Although we are not opposing this clause, as we opposed a similar clause in the corresponding Act controlling civil aviation, we are going to accept this clause in this Bill. However, we are not happy about the present situation which has led, as I have said, to offences. Officials of departments are tempted to commit corruption and hence all the evils which are tied up with the application of the Act as a whole. We accept this amendment with the reservation that we feel that this is not the answer, but that the answer is a complete review of the original Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban Point wants to link a whole series of matters to this one amendment. He wants to make out a case that this is an example which illustrates that there is dissatisfaction with the decisions of the National Transport Commission, even to the extent, according to him, that corrupt practices occur. I want to say at once that his approach is entirely wrong. In the first instance, he wants to involve the Railways by insinuating that the National Transport Commission is protecting the transport of the Railways.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>This is not so. On the contrary, the Railways itself has requested a certain relaxation in the issue of carrier certificates. This is the fact of the matter. Act No. 39 of 1930 was placed on the Statute Book in order to provide, in the first place, that the local transportation board would be the controlling body for granting or refusing licences. If any dispute were to arise, the National Transport Commission, as an autonomous body, would be the body to which a person could go on appeal. The fact of the matter is that the basic principle from which Parliament proceeded was that control over the issue of carrier certificates was to be exercised by the National Transport Commission together with the local road transportation boards. Now the position is that bodies and persons have found a loophole in this Act in that they simply purchase the shares of a company. In this way one finds one large monopolistic organization buying up the shares of the various companies and building up a large empire to gain control over private transport as a whole. The Act contains no provision for the local road transportation boards or the National Transport Commission to prevent anything of this nature from happening. In Act No. 51 of 1949. i.e. the Act regulating the issue of permits to air services, there is no similar loophole. That Act does contain a section which enables the National Transport Commission to exercise its authority if there is any takeover of shares or if shares change hands. This amendment is being effected simply to bring this Act into line with that Act. with which all of us are satisfied. In other words, we are simply trying to achieve in practice the original object of that Act.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Deputy Minister must admit that this amendment to the Act constitutes direct interference with the principle of free trade.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I admit that. That is why we on this side of the House are not opposing this clause. However, we are doing so reluctantly, because this interferes with private trade, with the whole principle of free enterprise.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is an extension of that principle, because now a person first has to ensure that he will be able to obtain transfer of a permit before he buys a firm. In other words, he has to reveal his plan. By doing so he is revealing his plan to his opposition as well. Otherwise he has to run a risk. We realize and we accept the problem of monopolies which exclude the small man. For example, I know that in Durban in my constituency there are complaints concerning the existence of a monopoly, &#x201C;closed shops&#x201D;, as they call them, and that existing interests are keeping the door closed to any competition from newcomers. But that competition may be allowed by means of granting additional certificates.</p>

<p>It is bound up with this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this legislation deals with the consequences of the refusal of certificates. I say a situation is existing, even in my own constituency, of people saying that they cannot obtain such certificates. Consequently they have to try to get in at the back door by obtaining shares in companies which do have certificates. So this clause is the direct consequence of the policy being followed in the application of the Act. There is no point in the hon. the Deputy Minister <span class="col_8855-8856" refersTo="page_1561"/>adopting a pious attitude by speaking of monopolies. This is not the solution. This is undesirable interference which is essential because of worse malpractices and more serious problems. However, I make another plea to the hon. the Deputy Minister not to see this matter in isolation, but as part of a larger problem. Malpractices occur not only with regard to the certificates, but also with regard to the use of those certificates. The hon. the Deputy Minister will not deny that there has in fact been corruption on a large scale in connection with road transportation. He cannot deny that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>But what is causing the malpractices? What is causing the corruption? What is causing the situation when carriers are prepared to pay large sums of money to officials if there is no need to do so, if it is not a paying proposition for them to pay money in order to evade the provisions of the Act? Instead of tackling the fundamental problem, we are seeking to close the loophole. The problem as a shole we are leaving untouched. My plea is that we should not just try to close a loophole. It is necessary to do so, but we should look for the reasons why that loophole is being used. We should examine and see the problem as a whole and not as one small part of a total problem.</p>

<p>I know the hon. the Deputy Minister will not agree. The Government never agrees with practical proposals. The Government believes it is always right, but in this case it is wrong. We are supporting this clause in order to prevent and counteract more serious trouble, but we are not happy with the background against which this clause is being proposed.</p>

<p>Clause 19:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#usher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. USHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this clause highlights the acute shortage of manpower we have in industry today. This is particularly so in heavy industry. The hon. the Minister now asks us to amend the Mines and Works Act so that females can be allowed to work in shifts covering a 24 hour period, if the hon. the Minister is going to do this, he should see to it that special regulations be implemented for the employment of women over these long stretches. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister cannot find skilled or semiskilled males to do this work, he has to make sure that the females who are stepping in to do the work which would normally be done by males, are protected. What protection must he give them? Firstly I would say that no woman should normally be expected to work after 6 o&#x2019;clock in the evening, the time one would expect the second shift to start. She should not be allowed to work for more than six hours per night shift. I think that is the first provision we should make. I also want to say that no pregnant woman should be allowed to work in other than daylight working hours. I would also like to suggest that no married women should be allowed to work at night. That means that if 6 o&#x2019;clock is going to be the hour for the second shift to come on duty, no married woman should be allowed to work after 6 o'clock. She can then be home with her family after 6 p.m.</p>

<p>This provision to give industrialists or mining companies the opportunity to employ women for these stretches, should not in any event result in victimization of any woman as far as the job is concerned. It should not be obligatory for women to work overtime if they want to keep their job. The overtime should be done by only those women who volunteer to do overtime. I feel that it should in all cases exclude married women from working at night, especially those who have young children at home. I feel that it should definitely exclude pregnant women from overtime work or shift work I do not know how these suggestions can be brought into the Act and whether the Minister can do this by way of regulation or not, But I would like to hear what the hon. the Minister feels about this. Bearing in mind the type of work these people have to do, I think we must see to it that the women should have the opportunity of refusing overtime without losing their jobs.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rosettenville has pointed out a few important aspects concerning the employment and the working hours of women. Now I should like to tell the hon. member that what we are doing here is merely to bring the Mines and Works Act into line with the Factories, Machinery and Building Work Act. In terms of that Act we already have <span class="col_8857-8858" refersTo="page_1562"/>the position that the Minister of Labour may grant certain exemptions with regard to a specific factory or building work. Certain restrictions and conditions are imposed by him when he grants such exemptions. In other words, wide experience has been gained as far as this matter is concerned. Now the situation has arisen, however, that a place such as Iscor or Vanderbijlpark falls under the Mines and Works Act, whereas in actual fact it is nothing but a factory. They have already carried out those experiments with the employment of women, for example as crane drivers, but only on day shift. Night shift means half an hour after sundown up to half an hour before sunrise.</p>

<p>Now, with the support of the trade unions, they have requested the inclusion of this provision in the Mines and Works Act as well, in order to meet the situation. I shall definitely exercise great cape, in the light of what has been said here, in the light of the experience of my colleague, the Minister of Labour, and in the light of investigations into the specific matters, in order to satisfy myself that such restrictions and conditions will he imposed as will take into account the important aspects with regard to the social and the married status of the women, the children in the family, their ages, as well as facilities for women at the places of employment. Now I may just say that these facilities have already been established in the case of Iscor, and it will greatly relieve their situation if we are in a position to grant them exemptions, subject to such restrictions and conditions as envisaged by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>The Chartered Accountants Designation (Private) Act was piloted through this House during 1927 by Adv. C. R. Swart, the hon. member for Ladybrand and later our highly-esteemed first President of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The existing Act s English text was signed by the Governor-General. The Afrikaans equivalent of the English designation and/ or title is not quoted in the English text. This was a very unfortunate oversight. The position is therefore that neither the designation &#x201D; Chartered Accountant&#x201D; nor the title &#x201C;G.R. (S.A.)&#x2019;&#x2019; is protected at present. The danger is that persons who are not qualified, or who are suspended accountants, can unlawfully used the designation &#x201C;Chartered Accountant&#x201D; or the title &#x201D; G.R. (S.A.)&#x201D; without it being possible to take action against them. You can understand how the public could be misled or even deceived by this.</p>

<p>And then there is the further injustice, i.e. that the Afrikaners in the accountancy profession cannot use their rightful title in their mother tongue, but must use the English equivalent of &#x201C;C.A. (S.A.)&#x201D;. What this amounts to is that the Afrikaner&#x2019;s language is being undervalued.</p>

<p><span class="col_8859-8860" refersTo="page_1563"/>The National Council of Chartered Accountants of South Africa are anxious to have this anomaly eliminated. and asked and authorized me to bring this Bill before the hon. House, as I am now doing.</p>

<p>Every province of the Republic of South Africa has its own Society. Since 1927 the names of all four Provincial Societies have been changed. A considerable number of accountants have been endeavouring, for a long time, to establish a National Association, instead of the present Provincial Societies. The National Council of Chartered Accountants of South Africa has already taken steps to give effect to this wish of the majority of accountants.</p>

<p>The insertion of the words: &#x201C;&#x2026; or of any successor/s in title to any of the aforementioned Societies&#x201D; in section 1, is to make provision for possible future development.</p>

<p>The penal provision of R100 is being increased to R500 to bring it in line with present-day custom.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have no objection to the Second Reading of this Bill. As the hon. member for Sunnyside has said, the object of the Bill is to protect certain words for the accounting profession, and is in the interests of the profession itself and the public outside.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second</block>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that the Minister in his Budget speech earlier this year announced that it was the intention, <i>inter alia</i>, to construct two guaranteed railway lines, one in the northern Cape from Groveput to a terminus on the farm Vogelstruisbult and the other in the Transvaal from Beestekraal to a terminus on the farm Vogelfontein. The Minister also announced the proposed construction of a new line from Arnot power station to Wonderfontein station to link up with the private line from Broodsnyersplaas to Arnot power station. As will be recalled, parliamentary approval for the acquisition of this section of line has since been obtained.</p>

<p>The Railways and Harbours Board has examined the proposals and has recommended the construction of the proposed lines. As full details of these lines are furnished in the Report of the Railways and Harbours Board, which has already been tabled, my remarks will be brief.</p>

<p>I will now deal with the proposed line from Groveput to Vogelstruisbult. Anglo-Transvaal Consolidated Investment Company has requested that a guaranteed line of main-line standard be constructed over a distance of approximately 48 kilometres from Groveput, an interloop in the vicinity of Prieska, to a terminus on the farm Vogelstruisbult for the conveyance of zinc and copper concentrates and pyrite to be mined on the farm owned by Prieska Copper Mines (Pty.) Limited for export and local processing. It will take two years to construct the proposed line at a cost of some R4,8 million. Bearing in mind the economic advantages which the mining of the deposits concerned holds in store for the country as a whole, it is considered that justification exists for the construction of the desired line. The agreement between the Administration and the company, which forms an annexure to the Construction Bill, will apply for a period of 20 years and in terms thereof the company will compensate the Railway Administration within the initial 20 years of the existence of the line for the capital invested in the line as well as for any interest accruing thereon. The Administration will during this period also be indemnified against operating losses on the line. Apart from the foregoing, provision is made in the agreement for a fund to be built up during the period of 20 years which, after expiry of this period, will be used to defray <span class="col_8861-8862" refersTo="page_1564"/>any losses which may be sustained on the working of the line during the ensuing period of ten years. The company is, therefore, liable to indemnify the Administration directly and indirectly against operating losses for a period of 30 years.</p>

<p>Pretoria Portland Cement Company Ltd., has approached the Railway Administration in regard to the construction of a guaranteed line of approximately 14 kilometres between Beestekraal station&#x2014; the terminal station on the Brits-Beestekraal railway line&#x2014;and the farm Vogelfontein for the conveyance of limestone which the company intends mining on the farm for its cement factories at Hercules (near Pretoria) and Jupiter (near Johannesburg).</p>

<p>The company has undertaken to construct the line to departmental standards at its own cost and on completion thereof to hand it over to the Administration who will then exploit the line as a guaranteed line. This offer is acceptable, especially as the Administration will not be called upon to invest any capital in the construction of the line and the Railways will not be able physically to undertake the work departmentally at present. The estimated cost of the construction of the line is R2 million and it will he completed within approximately 1 &#x00BD; years.</p>

<p>The guarantee period will, also in this case, extend over a period of 20 years, but in terms of the agreement, which forms an annexure to the Bill, the Administration will be indemnified against operating losses for a period of 30 years. Since there are indications that other traffic will also be convened over the line it will not be reasonable to expect of the company to grant the line to the Administration free of compensation; provision has accordingly been made in the guarantee agreement for the company to be compensated for the capital invested. The Railways will, however, not gain financially from the exploration of the new line until such time as the capital invested by the company has been accounted for.</p>

<p>The existing line between Beestekraal and Brits is being strengthened primarily for the company&#x2019;s traffic; due regard was also had to the company&#x2019;s traffic demands in the improvement of the carrying capacity of the line between Brits and Pretoria.</p>

<p>I now come to the proposed line between Arnot power station and Wonder-fontein. Owing to the growing traffic demands on the main line between Pretoria and Komatipoort as a result of the development and growth in the Eastern Transvaal, especially in the mining sector at Phalaborwa and in the Steelpoort area, as well as the establishment of heavy industries at Witbank, and Middelburg and near Machadodorp, it is essential that the carrying capacity of the Eastern Transvaal main line be increased in its entirety. A commencement has already been made with extensive improvements over the section between Nelspruit and Lebombo at the Portuguese border. Apart from the great lack of line capacity, serious problems are presently experienced in respect of yard capacity, especially at Middelburg and Witbank. The train service over the line between Derwent and Witbank, for instance, is very intensive and operating problems on this section are particularly serious as much shunting has to be performed at intermediate stations. In the absence of adequate yard facilities, shunting operations have to be executed from the main line which considerably hampers the flow of traffic on the already congested section.</p>

<p>Owing to the layout of the Witbank complex. unfavourable gradients and undermined ground, it is, however, not practicable to provide modern facilities at Witbank or in the vicinity thereof. The only way in which the difficulties experienced could be overcome, would be to divert, as far as possible, traffic not destined for Witbank itself from this area. This could be brought about by providing a by-pass route between Eastern Transvaal and the Witwatersrand.</p>

<p>In order to provide this by-pass route it is the intention to construct a single railway fine from Arnot power station to Wonderfontein station over a distance of approximately 22 kilometres to link up with the line between Broodsnyersplaas and Arnot power station, the acquisition of which was recently sanctioned by Parliament. The line will be of main-line standard, electrified and equipped with centralized traffic control. It will take approximately two years to complete the work and is estimated to cost R6,8 million.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. we on this side of the House support the construe ion of these three lines, In particular we are pleased to see the opening up of the mineral areas of the North-West Cape by the construction of the line from Groveput <span class="col_8863-8864" refersTo="page_1565"/>to Vogelstruisbult via Prieska. We feel that development will take place in this area, and these lines will be required. Eventually, when the new line is built from Sishen to Saldanha Gay, a large area will have been opened up for the exploitation or our mineral resources.</p>

<p>The second line which will be built from Beestekraalstasie to Vogeltontein, is being built by the private company concerned. The Administration therefore does not have to bear the cost of this line. It was gratifying to learn of the considerable iron ore deposits in this area, and it is hoped that by extending this line by another 16 kilometres, that iron ore will be successfully mined. I am only sorry that the line is not going to be extended all the way at this stage, because it takes so long to build these lines and to arrive at decisions. If the line is taken over by the Administration, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated, as may happen, the capital will of course be refunded to the company concerned.</p>

<p>The other line that is being built, from Arnot power station to Wonderfontein, is a different kettle of fish. The Deputy Minister highlighted a situation there, which I think is very serious. He spoke of the congestion on the lines in this particular area. One can visualize the bottlenecks that exist in that area. It is very necessary to build this line if we are going to continue to export coal, because the construction of the line to Richard&#x2019;s Bay is going to take some time. I should like to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister and to the Administration: It is time that replanning was undertaken in connection with this area, because it is quite evident that a serious state of affairs exists there, and something mud be done.</p>

<heading>SECOND RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION BILL</heading>

<p>(Second Reading)</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second</block>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members will remember that earlier this year the Minister announced that it was the intention to construct a new railway line from Ermelo to Broodsnyersplaas to make the large-scale exporting of coal possible from the Witbank area through the new harbour which is going to be built at Richard&#x2019;s Bay.</p>

<p>Full particulars of the contemplated railway line are given in the report of the Railways and Harbours Board, which has already been Tabled, and therefore my remarks will be brief.</p>

<p>At the request of the Transvaal Coal Owners Association, the Government gave its approval for the authorization, originally granted to coal producers in the Transvaal, for the exporting of about 3,6 million tons of coal per year for a period of 30 years, to be amended so that it would be possible for the producers to export a maximum quantity of 109 million tons of coal at a rate that will not exceed 9 million tons annually. However, the Eastern Transvaal main line has reached saturation point, and therefore the additional tonnage of coal envisaged cannot be transported to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques unless comprehensive improvements to the railway line are introduced. Mindful of the harbour, which is envisaged at Richard&#x2019;s Bay, an investigation was conducted into the possibility of providing a railway junction between the Witbank coalfields and the Ermelo-Vryheid line. An agreement was reached with T.C.O.A. that exports would take place through the new harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay from 1st April, 1976. With a view to implementing this, it will be necessary to provide a rail link from Ermelo to Broodsnyersplaas, and to reconstruct the existing line between Ermelo and Vryheid at the same time to make heavy unit trains possible. The Railways will be guaranteed against operating losses on the new line, and it is therefore necessary that the shortest suitable route be taken. It is thought that the proposed route over Davel would be the most suitable, because it would traverse easier terrain, the construction of the line therefore being cheaper; it would also establish a shorter through route between the Rand and Richard&#x2019;s Bay. The length of the proposed railway line will be about 93 kilometres, and the construction work will take about four years.</p>

<p>In terms of the agreement guarantee, the T.C.O.A. will carry 50 per cent of the net <span class="col_8865-8866" refersTo="page_1566"/>operating losses; the Government will compensate the Railways for the remaining 50 per cent of such losses.</p>

<p>Since the guarantee period will only be ten years, the capital investment, including interest, must be recovered within this period.</p>

<p>The agreemen. guarantee forms a schedule to the Construction Bill, and I therefore do not want to go into the conditions in detail. The construction costs of the line will amount to about R41 million, including electrification. The T.C.O.A. was given the assurance that everything possible would be done to provide berthing facilities for the handling of cargo ships of up to 150 000 tons in Richara&#x2019;s Bay by April, 1976, and that the necessary rail facilities would also be ready for operation by that date.</p>

<p>Because of multiple obligations, the Railways will not be able to undertake the construction of the railway line. Neither is the Treasury able to make available the money necessary for the project in addition to the Administration&#x2019;s normal needs. With a view to this, it was decided that the construction of the new line, the improvements to the existing line between Ermelo and Vryheid and the required rolling stock, must be carried out and supplied by contractors, on the basis that the contractors would also finance the project to the greatest possible extent. It is proposed to entrust the implementation of the project to a consortium, and tenders will be invited as soon as this is practicable; tenderers will be requested to also submit their financing proposals with their tenders. I shall give the House further information about this when the next Order Paper is dealt with.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we support the construction of this line and we are pleased to see that the Government is at last doing something constructive about the export of our minerals in this country, especially coal. We have been listening to excuses over the years. This line is going to take four years to build and we hope that in the interim while the line is being built the necessary trucks and electric traction units will be provided for this line.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, naturally this line will not be operating for four years. In the interim, with effect from 1st September, 1972, the coal will have to be exported. I take it.</p>

<p>via Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. We have just heard of the acute overloaded conditions that exist on that particular line to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. A considerable capacity will be required on this line for the export of coal. The report of the Railways and Harbours Board in this connection, <i>inter alia</i>, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association accordingly concluded an agreement with Japanese interests earlier this year whereby approximately 27,2 million tons of coal will be exported to Japan as from 1st September, 1972.</block>

<p>They are also hopeful of other contracts. We on this side of the House also welcome the terms of the financial agreement, and we note that the building of this line will be done by a private consortium. I think the terms of the agreement are sound in that they will be subsidized in respect of the longer distance from the coal fields to Richard&#x2019;s Bay. It should be an economic proposition. I think the Administration should keep this in mind when levying freight charges in respect of this line. There is one thing that we must do to encourage our exports. Especially where a contract of this magnitude has been obtained I think we should get stuck in and get on with the job. The only worry that we have on this sine or the House is the restrictions that exists on the Eastern Transvaal line to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. We hope that the hon. the Minister can tell us that plans are afoot at the present moment to provide the necessary traction units and vehicles to carry the coal from this area to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques and later to Richard&#x2019;s Bay.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am standing up to record the disappointment of my constituency at the route that is going to be taken by this line. I understand. and it is also very clear to us, that we are dealing here with a line which is being guaranteed by the Transvaal Coal Owners&#x2019; Association, that it is a line which has to be built quickly and that it is a line, in addition, which is being constructed with a specific purpose, i.e. the transport of coal. If we look at the report of the Railways and Harbours Board, which instituted an investigation into this railway line, certain facts come to the fore. The hon. the Deputy Minister has already mentioned the first fact in his speech. i.e. with <span class="col_8867-8868" refersTo="page_1567"/>respect to the needs, the requirements and the speed with which the line must be built. From that it appears clearly that the line will have a lifespan of about ten years for the transportation of coal.</p>

<p>I should now like to lodge a plea, on behalf of a portion of my constituency, i.e. Hendrina, which I believe to be one of the few towns, if not the only town in the Eastern Transvaal which is not yet served by a railway line, or at least record my disappointment here. Various alternatives were investigated to a greater or lesser degree, with a view to the determination of a route which this railway line could follow. Another route was investigated in part. This would link up with a point quite a bit further north. The objection to that, particularly with respect to the portion running through the constituency of my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Ermelo, was that it would traverse mining ground. That is a very understandable and comprehensible problem. Neither do I think they insist that the route should go in that particular direction. But if we look at the section in my constituency, and particularly the portion running past the town of Hendrina, we find that a railway line has been constructed here which runs through the veld, through a very small railway station, Davel, and thence to Ermelo. That particular little town, Davel, is already served by another railway line. It is therefore not of essential importance to them. But about ten to twelve miles away from the route suggested in this report, lies the town of Hendrina. Hendrina forms the centre of the new power generation field of South Africa. Power stations are developing&#x2014;and these are in various stages of development&#x2014;which will form the greatest complex of its kind in the world when they are completed. This means, therefore, that thousands of families are going to find their future homes in the immediate vicinity of Hendrina. at the two large power stations, Hendrina and Arnott. A little distance away is also the Komati power station. That complex is going to house thousands of people in the future. Hendrina is exclusively dependent upon a road transport service link. Their supplies are only conveyed by road transport service. They now saw a possibility for attention to be given to the agitation which has continued unabated since 1925 for a railway line to serve this community. They saw here, since the coal interests now coincide with local interests, an opportunity for us to possibly obtain a railway line to eventually serve this area as desired. Therefore our disappointment is so great that this railway line is being planned to traverse the veld and not to pass through Hendrina. In support of my statement I should just like to quote from the Railways and Harbours report. Firstly, they state the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>Quite understandably, the wishes of the different instances varied in accordance with the interests of the areas they represented, but after several interviews had been accorded by the Minister of Transport and the Railway Commissioners, it became evident that mainly the following two routes were advocated by the local interests (Transvaal Coal Owners Association excluded), viz.&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(I) a railway line from a point on the existing railway line between Broodsnyersplaas and Arnott power station to Estancia station on the Breyten-Bethal section in order that coal could be conveyed via Breyten.</li>

</ol>

<p>I have already explained that this proposed section would traverse undermined land. No-one insisted on it very strongly. I believe there was a deputation from my hon. colleague&#x2019;s constituency which recommended it, but they immediately understood the problem. The second alternative mentioned here is a railway line from Ermelo to Broodsnyersplaas passing through or near to Hendrina. The Railways Board, however, went further and said in their report that the main consideration which applied in connection with the construction of a connecting railway line from Ermelo to Broodsnyersplaas is to provide a railway line for the conveyance in bulk of export coal in long, heavy unit trains to the proposed harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay. In addition, they said that the following factors are also of importance. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) To provide a feeder line from the Reef to the future harbour at Richard&#x2019;s Bay (that is indeed the main purpose), and</li>

<li>(b) to stimulate development in 1he areas through which it will run.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_8869-8870" refersTo="page_1568"/>This consideration was actually the one on which we based our hopes, Now, however, the Railways Board comes to the conclusion and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These considerations were, therefore, constantly borne in mind by the Railway Board in its investigations of the various possible routes for a railway line, but in weighing up the merits of the proposed two routes, the development of the areas which they would serve was not regarded as a decisive factor.</block>

<p>The areas, through which the railway lines would pass, were not regarded as decisive factors by the Railways Board. Our disappointment results from the fact that a railway line is being constructed with a useful lifespan of ten years for the primary object for which it is being constructed. After ten years the railway line will be increasingly dependent on other forms of transport over the same section, so that it can be made consistently profitable. We understand very clearly that in ten years&#x2019; time there will no longer be any problems in terms of the contract, which also forms a part of the report, but our problem is that a section of the line will then by-pass a community which is growing by the day. In fact, it is one of the areas with the most rapid growth in the Transvaal, if not in the whole of South Africa. It is one of the areas singled out by the Department of Planning as one of the most rapidly growing areas in the Transvaal. Also, I have received a letter from the Department of Planning in which they clearly emphasize how this area is going to develop.</p>

<p>That, then, is also the reason why our disappointment is so great. We are disappointed because this route could not be amended to serve Hendrina, the centre of this great development, with a view o future expansion. However, I do not want to weary hon. members for long. I want to conclude by saying that I do not believe that on this occasion the Railways Board instituted a sufficiently intensive investigation into a route which would go right past Hendrina. I say this because I suspect that a railway line going right past Hendrina would not have cost more, but I cannot argue the point because I do not have the figures before me and because there was no investigation that made available figures that could serve as a comparison. With respect to gradients and turns, it would compare favourably with the other railway line, and it would compare even more favourably if the construction of bridges and other factors were also to be taken into consideration. In other words, I want to claim that a railway line could have been constructed at exactly the same cost to go right past Hendrina, the same primary object, i.e. to serve as a route for the transportation of coal. If it had followed the route past Hendrina it would, however, also have had art additional value, and an inestimable value as far as we are concerned. I therefore regret that I must express my disappointment about the route that is going to be taken by this railway line.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I firstly want to thank the hon. member for Salt River for his support in connection with this measure. At the same time I want to give him the assurance that the Railways will, in the interim period, do everything in its power to carry the maximum load with respect to exports to Louren&#x00E7;o Marques. The fact that this undertaking is being done in this way, is simply further proof of the fact that the Railways are keeping pace with South Africa&#x2019;s development by ensuring that the transport is provided so that it can furnish the new markets we are going to obtain overseas.</p>

<p>I can very well understand the hon. member for Middelburg feeling unhappy. I want to record the fact that this is not the first time the hon. member for Middelburg has come with his representations, now that the railway line is an accomplished fact. The hon. member for Middelburg has already repeatedly stated the interests of his constituency as an M.P. ought to do. I have the minutes before me of meetings between the Railways Board and the hon. member for Middelburg and his town councillors. I think that the hon. member has promoted the matter, as much as he has been able to, for the sake of his own community&#x2014; he did not do it politically, because one does not construct a railway line for political ends. The hon. member himself gives the answers to three aspects. He says himself that we must take the shortest route. The shortest rou e. however, is not merely a matter of capital saving. The hon. member thinks that if the railway line were to go through Hendrina. the project could be cheaper, with fewer bridges and so on. The shortest route has two elementary prerequisites. <span class="col_8871-8872" refersTo="page_1569"/>The first is the possible capital saving, and the other is the long-term operational saving with respect to the tariff, etc., on the transportation of the coal. We must now remember that this is not a railway with a ten-year lifespan&#x2014;it is a ten-year guarantee contract. I want to state expressly that there is a ten-year contract for the transportation of coal on this railway line, hut that it then also becomes a commercial line, being the shortest route from the Witwatersrand area to Richard&#x2019;s Bay. That is why one has to take that distance into consideration.</p>

<p>As far as the other aspect is concerned, the hon. member says&#x2014;and this is true&#x2014; that 50 per cent of the financing of this railway line is being done by us, and 50 per cent by TCOA. In other words, one must bear in mind those people with whom one concludes a contract for the construction of a railway line.</p>

<p>Yes, the guarantee is 50 per cent. Now the hon. member says that the Railways Board probably did not institute an intensive and adequate investigation. The Railways Board also has, to a very large extent, to fall back on the engineers. In the first instance investigations were instituted by means of aerial photographs, etc.</p>

<p>As far as the last aspect is concerned, I want to say that we accept the fact that Hendrina has made out a very good case for its future development. But if Hendrina grows, as the hon. member says, to metropolitan proportions, it will come into consideration for a Rail link when that happens, because the hon. member himself says that the distance is only 12 miles. I can well understand the hon. member being disappointed, as would be any other person who does not have a railway line through one of the important towns in his constituency.</p>

<p>When the Railway Budget for the present financial year was submitted to Parliament in March, 1971, negotiations with the Transvaal Coal Owners Association and other interested parties in connection with the construction of the new railway line between Ermelo and Broodsnyersplaas had not yet been concluded, and provision could not be made at that stage for the necessary expenditure.</p>

<p>As expected, all the necessary formalities will be completed in time, so that in the course of this financial year lenders can be invited for the construction of the aforementioned railway line, the improvement of the Ermelo-Vryheid section and the supply of rolling stock and other assets which will be needed for the envisaged large-scale exportation of coal.</p>

<p>In the case of contracts in which the contractors not only carry out the construction work, but also provide the equipment and foot the bill as far as the financing is concerned, it is customary for a 10 per cent advance payment on the total costs of the project to be made when the contract is signed. The final contract price will be known after receipt and judgment of the tenders, but it is expected that the railway portion of the project will cost about R150 million, and provision must therefore be made for a cash payment of R15 million during the current financial year.</p>

<p>In terms of section 47 of the Exchequer and Audit Act (No. 23 of 1956) the State President may, by special warrant, authorize the Administration to incur unforeseen expenditure not exceeding, in the aggregate&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) the sum of one million rand; (ii) the amount by which its accrued earnings, calculated to the last day of the month immediately preceding the day on which the special warrant is issued, exceeds the proportion of its earnings, calculated to the said day on the basis of the estimate of revenues at the commencement of the financial year, whichever amount is the greater;</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_8873-8874" refersTo="page_1570"/>It is not expected that the revenue, up to the day on which the agreement is concluded with the successful tenderer, will exceed the Budget by the necessary R15 million, and the advance will therefore have to be authorised by way of an additional Appropriation. The envisaged expenditure of R15 million will be financed from the Reserve Account of the Sinking Fund.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second</block>

<p>Time.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recall that Parliament recently approved of certain improved pension benefits for railway servants and pensioners. In this connection I am referring to the Railways and Harbours Pensions Act, 1971 (Act No. 35 of 1971).</p>

<p>The Bill now before the House is necessary to amend certain other Railway Acts which also pertain to pension matters. I can, however, give the House the assurance that the provisions of this Bill are only of a consequential nature and that it contains no new principle. It is also for this reason that the customary explana ory memorandum has not been made available to hon members.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House support the Second Reading of this Bill which contains important provisions which will improve the lot of Railway pensioners&#x2019; widows, particularly&#x2014;and we realize that it is essential that these people should be afforded financial relief, especially in view of the spiralling cost of living.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Deputy Minister has stated, this is in fact the third instalment of the various concessions that were announced by the Minister of Transport in his Budget speech on the 10th of March this year. In that speech the hon. the Minister announced that the contribution to the Superannuation Fund would be on the basis of 4 per cent of pensionable salary. Amending legislation was introduced, and as the hon. the Deputy Minister had indicated, we had an opportunity of discussing further amendments when the Railways and Harbours Pensions Bill was discussed, which has now become Act No. 35 of 1971. That particular piece of legislation also brought about a slight change in that in the main administrative details will now be dealt with on the basis of regulations. However, Sir, there are certain comments which I feel I should make on the Bill which is before us this afternoon. This is the third and final instalment in a series of measures to make provision for persons to receive additional benefits, and I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he has given consideration to the position of persons who are paid gratuities or annuities and who are not members of the fund, I refer particularly to the Indian employees of the S.A. Railway Administration. I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether I am correct in saying that in terms of this Bill they will not receive any of these additional benefits.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! We are only concerned with the contents of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. N. OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, I am going to deal with the contents of the Bill. I am merely asking whether that group will fall under the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>Then there are certain aspects that I wish to raise under clause I, and I mention them at this stage, in order to expedite the Committee stage. Provision is made here for additional increases and enhancements of the annuities which become payable. As the hon. the Minister announced in his Budget speech, these increases will be on a sliding scale. There will be a 15 per cent enhancement of the annuities payable to those persons who retired before the 1st April, 1968, or where the annuitant died before that date. Where persons retired or died before the 1st April, 1968, the annuity <span class="col_8875-8876" refersTo="page_1571"/>will be enhanced by 10 per cent, whereas in the case of those who retired after the 1st April, 1968, the increase will be five per cent, as indicated later in the Bill. Then the annuity is further enhanced by the addition of two per cent per annum, compounded annually. Clause 1 of this Bill also makes provision now for an additional enhancement of 15 per cent. Is this 15 per cent to be calculated on the final figure of the annuity, in other words after the 10 per cent has been added and after the addition of the two per cent per annum, compounded annually: in other words, is this to be calculated on the gross figure or merely on the annuity that becomes payable in terms of the legislation? If it is calculated on the gross figure, it would make a considerable difference.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill also makes provision for the elimination of the 20-year limit, as far as the addition of 2 per cent per annum, compounded annually, is concerned. In terms of the Bill before us this provision is to be deleted in the various clauses dealing with the addition of two per cent per annum, compounded annually. I believe that this is an important step. It is a step that we welcome, particularly in view of the fact that in 1969 when this 20-year limit was set by the hon. the Minister, we did voice our objection to the fact that it was pegged to 20 years. We are pleased to see that this 20-year limit is now to fall away in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other aspects of this Bill affecting the widows of Railway pensioners. As far as they are concerned, this Bill makes provision for certain improvements for them. I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether he can perhaps give some indication as to the effort of the various amendments, particularly in clause 9, which now contains a proviso with regard to widows&#x2019; annuities. Previously, the only proviso related to the addition of two per cent per annum, compounded annually, for a maximum of 20 years. The proviso now reads that in the case of an annuitant who dies, the two per cent enhancement of the widow&#x2019;s pension shall be calculated from the date on which the annuity first became payable to the annuitant. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Deputy Minister can give us some indication as to what the practical effect of this particular concession will be. This concession was announced by the hon. the Minister in his Budget speech, and he merely indicated that in future these increases would be payable to the widow from the date upon which her late husband retired from the service of the Railways. I should like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister what the practical effect will be of this amendment in terms of which the increase will be payable from the date upon which the person first became an annuitant.</p>

<p>Sir, we believe that this Bill provides relief for those who deserve relief and we believe in principle that it should be proceeded with as soon as possible and we support the Second Reading.</p>

<p>Sir, may I thank the hon. member for his support. The reply to his first question is that Indians are excluded, but I want to assure the hon. member that I am given to understand that this matter is at present receiving the attention of the management to see what can be done in connection with the Indians. With regard to his second question, the position is that the 15 per cent is payable over and above the two per cent.</p>

<p>*The hon. member&#x2019;s last question concerned clause 9. I just want to give him the particulars briefly. This clause provides for the 20-year limit for the payment of the 2 per cent enhancement of annuities, compounded annually, to be eliminated, and that such enhancement of the annuities of widow annuitants as well as the 55 per cent increase of such annuities shall apply from the date of the annuitant&#x2019;s retirement to afford relief to those annuitants, and widow annuitants, who retired a number of years ago. Provision also had to be made for the approved percentage additions to afford relief to those annuitants who retired a number of years ago.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 25, page 18, after &#x201C;representations&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;personally or through a legal representative&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to say immediately that my point of view in this matter is supported by the Association of Law Societies of Southern Africa, who feel very strongly about this matter, and in fact made representations in the form of a memorandum to the commission of inquiry which dealt with this Bill. The point that we wish to stress is that the clause provides for certain rules to be drawn up in connection with the termination of membership of a member of the Stock-Exchange. It is thought in some circles that as the Stock Exchange Committee itself deals with applications for membership and lays down the norms and the code by which it admits such members, and because of certain delicate matters which arise from time to time between members themselves and between members and the public whom they serve, this is a matter peculiar to the committee itself, and should be dealt with by the committee. It is felt that the member concerned should have the right to make his representations and thereafter supplied with a copy of the record. There are very often matters which the committee may wish to discuss with the member himself, and it may feel that it should not discuss those matters with anybody else but the member concerned. I want to point out to the Minister that those are matters which a committee could in any event discuss with a member, without the question of termination of membership necessarily being involved. I assume that the Minister is guided by the fact that in many clubs members are from time to time hauled over the coals by the committee. They may for instance be called before the committee to explain their conduct in the club either towards the staff or as a result of their relationship with other members. The question of termination, however, has a sense of finality about it. Termination of membership of the Stock Exchange actually brings to an end the source of livelihood of the member. To be blunt, it puts him out of business as a stockbroker. This is therefore a very important step, and even though he has a right of appeal to the Appeal Board, for which provision is made in the Act, and even though, if he is not satisfied with the decision of the Appeal Board, he can go to a court of law in order to place the merits of his case before that court, he can nevertheless on termination of membership be excluded from dealing on the market, and that decision is not in any way suspended because of the appeal or because of the further steps the stockbroker may take. Here I must point out that these steps can take a considerable length of time. It is true that the rules can provide for the committee to avoid such suspension pending the appeal if it wishes. But that is purely a permissive provision, and that is already contained in the Act and not subject to amendment. Therefore I was obliged to withdraw a suggested amendment to a later provision in the same clause whereby the Committee would be obliged to suspend any decision it would give pending such appeal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. member can discuss that later.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot, but I could discuss it later during the course of the debate on this clause. Anyhow, I have made the point. Therefore legal people feel that it is important that where termination is dealt with, a decision which has a sense of complete finality about it, the member should have a legal representative who can argue his case. It is not always easy for a person to make representations himself. Some people have a nervous reaction. Some are unable to express themselves in the way they would like. Although they can seek legal advice with regard to a situation they are not able to deal with the matter easily when confronted by a body of men who have sat for a considerable time on the subject before they have brought the member before them, and where also there is the possibility&#x2014;I do not say it will arise, but there is the possibility&#x2014;of prejudice, of competitive interest, or of jealousy. All sorts of human reactions may be seething through the minds of the members of the Committee. One would not like to suggest they would <span class="col_8879-8880" refersTo="page_1573"/>be guilty of such thinking, but it is human nature that such thinking can arise and be present at the time the man makes his representation. People sometimes instinctively feel that reaction when they make these representations. Therefore, from all these aspects, I believe&#x2014;and I think hon. members on this side of the House will accept that point of view&#x2014;that it will be in the interest of the member and in the interests of justice and in accordance with the normal traditions of practice in our country that, when a man is arraigned before his peers to face certain charges or accusations which can bring about the final termination of his membership, he should have the right not only to make personal representations, but also to do so through a legal representative.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>There are two matters here that we must understand very clearly. The first is that we have a question of discipline here. Now we all agree, and I think the hon. member for Parktown also made this very clear a few days ago, that the brokers must be disciplined. A broker is disciplined only when he acts contrary to the public interest, and for that reason it is essential that he be disciplined. But in the process of the application of discipline he is faced with none other than his colleagues here. He is not faced with an outside body; he is faced with his colleagues, who have been chosen by himself and other brokers to occupy that position on the committee, For that reason he is faced here with people who are in the first place extremely sympathetic towards him, people who are perhaps in the same position as our politicians. We also have to keep our voters in mind, and those committee members have to do the same. Should they act unreasonably towards a man who must again vote them in on the committee in the future, surely they can expect not to be re-elected. For that reason they will most certainly not aot unreasonably towards that broker. While the broker then still has the right of appeal, where he may come with legal representation, I consider it to be quite reasonable that at this first trial where he is faced with the committee only, he can discuss matters round the table with his colleagues without having legal representation.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. HOPEWEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am surprised at the attitude of the hon. member for Paarl, who was Chairman of the Commission, because the Commission&#x2019;s report supported the view of he hon. member for Jeppes. If we refer to the commission's draft Bill, in regard to which the commission was unanimous, it was regarded as fundamental that the person brought before the Stock Exchange should have the right to have a legal representative. Now he has changed his mind, hut he does not tell us why. I think that it is a very serious state of affairs when we have a report before the House unanimously supporting a Bill, and the chairman now takes a different attitude. It is interesting to note, too. that the Stock Exchange Committee itself, when it came before the commission felt that it was desirable to have its case presented by eminent counsel. Although they are all highly qualified stockbrokers, when it came to presenting their case before the commission, they were represented by eminent counsel. The very conduct which they demanded and which was in their best interests, namely that they should have counsel to represent them, they are now denying one of their members when he comes before them own committee. Surely, the Stock Exchange Committee is not more hostile than a committee of this House. Even though the committee of this House was examining a draft Bill submitted to us. it was quite prepared to have counsel represent them to put the Stock Exchange point of view. We sat and deliberated on this matter. This point was canvassed seriously, which took some time. When finally we submitted our draft Bill, we were unanimous. There was not a single dissenting vote among all the members of the commission. They were all in favour of the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Jeppes. I suggest that the hon. member for Jeppes has put up a good case based upon the principles which are fundamental to justice. I ask the hon. the Minister to consider it seriously because, no matter what representations have been made to him by the Stock Exchange Committee, their own attitude, when they came before the Select Committee. was to be represented by legal counsel. We suggest therefore that the hon. the Minister should accept the amendment which is before the Committee now.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what puzzles me is why this particular clause, which we have asked to be amended by the insertion of the words that appear in the Order Paper. should ever have been <span class="col_8881-8882" refersTo="page_1574"/>altered in this Bill. As the hon. member for Pinetown says, this was a unanimous recommendation of the commission. I think it is the view of everyone in every sphere of life that everybody shall be given the greatest justice possible. Why, therefore, take out the right of a broker to be represented by his lawyer or advocate? The only reason I have heard mentioned, is the one the hon. member for Jeppes has mentioned. The fact is that it is the Stock Exchange Committee themselves that admit a person to membership of the Stock Exchange. I do not think this really holds any water. What must one do to become a member of the Stock Exchange? One must be a respectable person: one must have a certain amount of capital and one must buy a number of seats on the Stock Exchange&#x2014;I think that it is two at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<p>And pass an examination.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, well, and pass what is called an examination. If one is honest, if one has rights, if one passes the examination and if one has the capital required in terms of the Act, one is automatically admitted as a member to the Stock Exchange. So the Stock Exchange has really very little to do with who can and who cannot become a member of the Stock Exchange. There are certain criteria which apply to all people and. if those criteria are met, those people must be admitted. The fact that they have allowed them in, does not really give them the right, as this Bill does, to put them out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes mentioned a club. I think we must get this out of our minds very quickly. This Committee here must not be under any illusions. Being a member of the Stock Exchange, may provide a very good social club, but the prime object of a person becoming a member of the Stock Exchange is to make a living the same as anybody else does. The prime purpose of membership of the Stock Exchange, as I shall mention in another context a little later, is a profit motive Nobody queries this. Brokers are there to make money the same as anybody else in any other business is out to make money. Once you deny a man the right to make a living in a particular sphere or by means of a particular occupation that he can only practice in a particular place, you are denying him something very serious indeed. It is said that this objection really floes not matter, because it can be taken on appeal. I think it matters a great deal because I believe that the onus will move from one person to another, which is always serious. Once the Committee of the Stock Exchange has said to a man: &#x201C;You can no longer be a member of the Stock Exchange&#x201D; it now becomes incumbent upon that person on appeal to prove that he should have the right to remain a member. This, I believe, is the big difference. I can see no reason at all why we should take rights away from people as is now envisaged in this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to begin by drawing to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and to the attention of this Committee, the fact that it has for years been a principle of our law&#x2014;and I suggest a sound principle of our law&#x2014;that if a man wishes to have legal representation, he is entitled to it. That principle has been departed from in the past in certain instances, in every instance, for reasons which the Government considers to be reasonable or sound. I hope the hon. the Minister will explain to this House why he considers that legal representation should not be allowed to a person whose membership is proposed to be terminated by the committee of the Stock Exchange. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that this is a very important matter. As the hon. member for Jeppes has pointed out, it could have the result of terminating a person&#x2019;s livelihood, the livelihood of a man who is probably not qualified to do anything else. He would therefore find it difficult to find a suitable alternative occupation, certainly at the same standard of living to which he is used. Therefore, it is a step which is very serious indeed so far as the member is concerned. The hon. member for Paarl suggests that this is not necessary because it is simply a disciplinary matter. There are many examples of disciplinary bodies that have to consider discipline within their own professions and occupations, where, even in such cases, the persons who are accused, as it were, have the right to legal representation to put their case. There is for example the disciplinary committee of the Medical Council. There are even the Police enquiries where representation is allowed. There are also others.</p>

<from><span class="col_8883-8884" refersTo="page_1575"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>And in the legal profession. They have to go to court with attorneys.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Mr. Chairman, I do not see any sound reason for depriving persons of legal representation in such cases. It does not detract in any way&#x2014;this is the point I should like to emphasize to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;from the powers or responsibilities of the committee considering the matter. The committee is still in a position, whether it is being addressed by lawyers or not, to decide the issue on its own. On the other hand the person who is subject to the enquiry, has a better opportunity of putting his case. It is not just a matter of finding some slick attorney or counsel as some people suggest which will be able to either bamboozle the committee or to put forward some case which may not be precisely in accordance with facts, so that he can assist a man who should be found guilty by the committee and whose membership should be terminated. The hon. the member for Jeppes has pointed out, and I should like to stress this, that ordinary individuals are usually not in the position to put their case properly in matters of this kind. They are obviously inexperienced and they may be very nervous because of the serious consequences to themselves if the matter should go wrong. All this may cause such persons not to put their case as well as the case might have been put. I want to emphasize that I am not now suggesting any distortion of the care, but I am suggesting that the case, on the facts as they are, can be put better by a man who is experienced. In this way, the committee itself will be in a better position to judge whether the termination of the membership is warranted or not.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl has also pointed out that the body concerned is made up of colleagues of the member. He has stressed the fact that the members of the committee are chosen by the member himself and his other colleagues. That is so. but I would like to point out against this argument that these people are laymen. Although they are in the same profession they are laymen and they may look at it from a point of view which may be somewhat biased. They may be biased to some extent because they are involved in this profession every day whereas if they are addressed by legal representatives a different point of view, which may not have occurred to them, may be put to them. They may regard this point of view as bad and may reject it eventually. In any event, it is a good thing if there is an opportunity whereby a different light can be placed on the facts by somebody who comes in independently. It should much rather be done by such persons than by persons who are involved in the profession every day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl also put the case that because they are colleagues of the member concerned, they would be sympathetic and they would not act unreasonably. because they would again be subject to re-election. It is not only a question of acting unreasonably. If they act unreasonably there is a remedy of appeal. The courts on appeal would be able to set aside a decision which is based on unreasonable grounds. This is not the case at all. The point is that a person who is no experienced in conducting an inquiry, may come to wrong conclusions simply because of his inexperience and not because of any lack of sympathy for any <i>mala fides.</i> For these reasons I suggest to the hon. the Minister that the hon. member for Jeppes&#x2019; amendment is sound. I go further and ask the hon. the Minister, if he disagrees, to tell us exactly why he wishes to depart from what I said initially, is a general principle of our law, namely that a man who wishes to have legal presentation should be entitled to it.</p>

<p>Mr Chairman, I have listened very attentively to the arguments which have been advanced by the hon. members on that side of the House. I must admit that I have considered these arguments quite seriously since the Second Reading debate. No new arguments have really been advanced whereby I am persuaded to change my mind in this respect. Consequently I shall not be able to accept this amendment. The new argument advanced, in the first place, by the hon. member for Pinetown was how the hon. member for Paarl could change his mind, seeing that he has been a member of the commission whose recommendations were unanimously accepted. On behalf of the hon. member for Paarl, I want to say that it is something that happens quite often. It is no exception that a person, after new evidence has been <span class="col_8885-8886" refersTo="page_1576"/>brought to him, changes his mind. It is now months since this recommendation has been published.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown mentioned a list of the qualifications of members of the Stock Exchange, but he forgot to mention one very important matter. According to this Bill, one very important qualification is being laid down where it is provided that the Minister should have the right to lay down regulations about the character, education, etc., of the members of the Stock Exchange. They will not necessarily be people who have written a certain examination, paid a certain amount as an entrance fee or who have a certain wealth or power; they must be people of a certain character, education and integrity. Then they are admitted by the Committee of the Stock Exchange. They are admitted by their own people. If their own people admit them, their own people can decide whether their membership should be terminated. That is the argument.</p>

<p>No. the regulation goes much further. They must in any case be people of integrity. As the hon. member rightly said, here they are peers and equals and they are judged by people of their own quality, standing and profession. I certainly expect that the members of the Stock Exchange Committee will consider other Exchange members in a very sympathetic way, more sympathetic perhaps than an outside body. I have already mentioned the argument that there is this Appeal Board which does not exist in the other professions. The member can. when there is a motion that his membership be terminated, have legal advice. He can bring that legal advice, written or otherwise, to the committee. If it is decided that his membership be terminated, he can appeal to the Appeal Board with his legal advice.</p>

<p>That is the main object of the Appeal Board, which does not exist in other professions. After that, if he is not satisfied, he can go to the ordinary courts. So he is completely protected. His livelihood cannot so easily be taken away from him. First he can appeal to the committee, then to the Appeal Board, and then the ordinary count. I think that by the time he reaches the ordinary court and his membership is then terminated, he can be sure that his membership has been terminated justifiably. I am sorry, but I can only promise hon. members that in the recess I shall again go into this matter. We do not want to make any hasty decisions. I shall again go into this matter from all angles. If I do find it necessary with an open mind, I shall come back next year and introduce an amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>We are naturally pleased that the hon. the Minister has indicated that he would be prepared to give this matter further serious consideration during the recess. I would, however, like to ask him to indicate to the House why he is not accepting the unanimous recommendation of the commission in this regard. It was unanimous in including a provision for legal representation in this clause. The hon. the Minister is doing away with that and I think this Committee is entitled to know why the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept in this respect the unanimous recommendation of the commission. I did ask the hon. the Minister when I spoke previously to tell us also why he is departing from the general rule in regard to legal representation. The general rule is quite simple, namely that if a man wishes to have legal representation he should be allowed to have it. There are not many cases in our law where we depart from that because it is a very sound principle.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister made the point that a stockbroker&#x2019;s own people, as he put it, admit him to membership and he suggested that it was therefore not unreasonable that his own people should be able to terminate his membership. I accept that principle unreservedly. We are not asking him to depart from that. In terms of the amendment of the hon. member for Jeppes the stockbroker&#x2019;s own people, namely the committee, will still be the body to terminate the membership and will still be the body to consider whether <span class="col_8887-8888" refersTo="page_1577"/>the termination is justified, Surely the hon. the Minister does not suggest that it would be reasonable for a body of stockbrokers who admits a member to have the power to terminate that membership without hearing the person concerned. That would be quite unreasonable even though it is the same body. He does not advance his argument to the extent that because they admitted him they Should also be able to terminate at will. The clause provides clearly that they will terminate a person&#x2019;s membership only after he has made representations. This, in brief, is the effect of the clause. All that we are asking is that the representation may, if a member so wishes, be made through a legal representative if he chooses to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. because of what the hon. the Minister has said, namely that he will perhaps have another look at the matter in due course even though he cannot accept the amendment now, I would like to draw his attention to one fact, namely that as far as the legal profession is concerned, and particularly the sidebar where rules of conduct play a very important part because of the trust reposed in this profession&#x2019;s dealings with the public, a member&#x2019;s membership cannot be terminated unless it goes to court and applies&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;member&#x201D; in line II up to and including</block>

<p>&#x201C;member&#x201D; in line 12.</p>

<p>The effect of this amendment is to allow the existing bank and the three trust companies to continue to remain members of the Stock Exchange, beyond 1978&#x2014;in fact for all time. Sir. the more discussion I hear on the proviso that these three companies should cease to be members of the Stock Exchange, the more convinced I become that our attitude is the correct one. Because what are the arguments that have been advanced that warrant taking away the rights of these three companies? The first argument is that the retention by these companies of their rights would create an untenable position and that it would give them a protected and permanent advantage over all other companies. The second one is that eventually the pressure from other companies would be so strong that you would have to throw open wide the doors of the Stock Exchange to company membership. Sir, in the Second Reading debate on this clause I pointed out that for 37 years, since 1934, by the Stock Exchange&#x2019;s own rules it has not been possible for any other company to become a member of the Stock Exchange. Where have these pressures been? We have not feared anything in the last 37 years. Why should we now suddenly be afraid that there is going to be an enormous build-up of pressure from all sorts of people demanding to be admitted to the Stock Exchange?</p>

<p><span class="col_8889-8890" refersTo="page_1578"/>This is not a new problem. It has been with us for over a quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Then, Sir. the suggestion is made that because these three companies are members, other companies must have the right to become members, or that if this right is not given to other companies, then these companies must lose their membership. In other words, the suggestion is: &#x201D; If I cannot have what you have, then you cannot have it either.&#x201D; Sir, this kind of thinking seems to smack of socialism, if not almost of communism! This is not part of our philosophy of life; we do not work that Way. This argument makes no impression upon us whatsoever.</p>

<p>The other main argument that has been advanced is that the three companies are getting more powerful by the day; that they are taking over other trust companies throughout the country. that they are widening and windening the areas of their influence and that in time they will dominate the Stock Exchange completely. It is interesting. Sir, that during the sittings of the commission we made suggestions that would eliminate any possible increase in the influence or power of these companies. We suggested, for example, that the existing companies, or new companies, if it had been possible for new ones to join the Stock Exchange, should have their voting rights limited; in other words, that however many companies there were on the Stock Exchange. the voting rights of those companies would be limited to, say, 5 per cent or 10 per cent.</p>

<p>In other words, they would always have a minority of votes and therefore they could not possibly bring sufficient pressure to bear on the Stock Exchange to disrupt it. This was found to be unacceptable. It was not accepted that a limitation of this kind would be effective. Sir, the hon. the Minister says that historical reasons are not enough to maintain the present position of the three trust companies I might agree with this if we were dealing with historical reasons, but we are dealing with far more than historical reasons. We are dealing with actual reasons and with legal reasons. These three companies have a legal right to be members of the Stock Exchange. Their rights are so good in law that we have to pass a Bill in Parliament to take these rights away from them. This goes a great deal further than mere historical rights.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are not prepared to be a party to the taking away of rights which we believe have not been abused and which we believe are still in the public interest. I have been through all the reasons and all the precedents which were submitted to the Stock Exchange Commission to try to find whether there is any valid reason why these three companies should not be allowed to continue as members of the Stock Exchange, and frankly. I cannot find one. Therefore we must vote against this clause and in favour of our amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to support the amendment standing in the name of the hon. member who has just sat down. I should like to point out Chat the only parties who appeared before the commission of inquiry and who objected to the continuation of the membership of these three companies were the Stock Exchange Committee itself and one other banking organization. Even the Franzsen Commission did not suggest the termination of the membership of these companies. All it said was that it would not like to have banking institutions as members of the Stock Exchange. It is in any event traditional in this country that we do not take away the rights of people when those rights have existed for years, if they contribute towards those people&#x2019;s livelihood, if the persons concerned have conducted themselves honourably in the course of the exercising of those rights, and if those rights are not inimical to the interests of the public.</p>

<p>The Stock Exchange Committee itself which gave evidence on this matter, conceded that these rights were not inimical to the interests of the public. They stated that it was not because these rights were not in the interests of the public that these companies&#x2019; membership should he terminated Furthermore, I should like the hon. the Minister to know that at one time, When the Broome Commission was sitting, the Stock Exchange Committee actually suggested that the membership of these companies be discontinued by Statute. They afterwards withdrew this request, and the Broome Commission discarded the matter The commission in fact did not deal with it at all. I understand that since then, and prior to this commission of inquiry, there was some question of the Stock Exchange discussing a compromise with one of these particular companies.</p>

<p><span class="col_8891-8892" refersTo="page_1579"/>The company, however, said that it was not prepared to compromise. It said that it had no particular grounds for entering into discussions with the Stock Exchange Committee on this matter. It was not prepared to negotiate and said that it was not prepared &#x201C;to have its rights disentrenched&#x201D;. Those were the words used, and that was the evidence given to us. I know that further evidence was sent to members of the commission of inquiry in this regard, in the form of voluminous memoranda. These memoranda contained information gathered from other countries of the world to try to prove that these companies would not have been admitted to the Stock Exchanges of other countries because they differed so much from them in principle. Furthermore, the report itself states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During May, 1953, we received information that the New York Stock Exchange constitution was amended to permit corporations to become member-organizations. One of the important principles was that it must primarily engage in broker dealing functions&#x2026;. The firm Brown Bros., Harriman and Company</block>

<p>I tried to remind the hon. the Minister of this company on a previous occasion.</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; is an exception to the general rule of the New York Stock Exchange that member organizations must primarily engage in broker dealing functions.</block>

<p>That was because this was a banking institution which had been in business for very many years in the United States, and it had an outstanding reputation. That is exactly the same state of affairs that exists in regard to these corporate bodies that are members of the Stock Exchange. They have existed, at least one of them, since virtually the birth of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. It is probably a foundation member. It has existed since 1888. I gave the wrong date on the previous occasion. I thought it was in the &#x2019;nineties, but it was in 1888, and it is accepted not only by the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but also the entire economic structure of the country and all business people and banking houses. It is accepted that these companies have done nothing but bring credit to the business of broking on the Stock Exchange of this country, both by the methods they have used and the investigations they provide and by the advice and research that they do in order to assist their clientele. Furthermore, as I pointed out previously, but I think it can bear repetition, despite the fact that over the last few years we have had the biggest business dealings recorded in the history of the Stock Exchange&#x2014;in fact, there were some days when we did a greater turnover than even New York&#x2014;it is an accepted fact&#x2014;I tried to compare the figures with the Sydney Stock Exchange, which is also a very large stock exchange, but it far exceeded any figures ever shown there&#x2014;in spite of all that, the total business done by these three companies at no time exceeded approximately 3 per cent of the business of the Exchange. So what fears can there be and what danger can there be. and what practice can they maintain that is harmful to the community? These people have been in business and I maintain they have vested interests like any other business organization which, when removed, have to be fully compensated. This is one of the recommendations made by the minority report. However, it was thought fit to give them compensation in the form of enabling them to continue in business for a further seven years, subject to the rules of the exchange. We maintain that this is not a traditional South African practice. In fact, the thought has been expressed that tradition does not matter, because Parliament is supreme, but Parliament should not interfere in the private affairs of the citizens unless it can be proved that it is detrimental to the interests of the citizen, and no case has been put up that it is detrimental to the interest of the citizen. There is a thought, furthermore, that the institution of corporate bodies is not practised in some of the other principal stock exchanges, such as Britain, Toronto and the United States. In Toronto the matter is very seriously under investigation. In England the London Stock Exchange has corporate membership of outside members. They do not control the membership in any way. They are there in order to provide risk capital for the capital structure for the broking undertakings. Who are we to take into consideration a memorandum which has been sent to us after the commission of inquiry completed its consideration of all matters? Who are we to accept merely an <i>ex parte</i> statement made beyond the scope of the commission&#x2019;s terms of reference and which states that the situation <span class="col_8893-8894" refersTo="page_1580"/>is not comparable? In fact, it has often been boasted in this House that we must deal with matters as we find them in our own country without looking for precedents. Then I say we should follow the traditions of our own country and do what is right and just in the interest of business people in this country, and not use the arbitrary right which Parliament is obviously using here in order to terminate the membership of people who have given nothing but satisfaction in the market and to the public and who have no blemish on their reputation. And that is conceded by all sides, by all who gave evidence. On those grounds we ask that the hon. the Minister should give further consideration to this matter and not just lightly do something which can create a dangerous precedent, Many of us here have never even seen the inside of the Stock Exchange, have not the faintest conception of dealings on the stock market and have no idea of why people have become involved and have lost money and how that can be avoided. [Interjections.] I said many people here in this House; I did not talk about the members of the commission. We have had the benefit of that. I say that in front of that commission of inquiry no evidence was given to sustain any sound, just reason why these people should have their membership terminated. All that has been done is that it was felt that because they believed it should be so&#x2014;the majority believed that&#x2014;it was decided to do away with it. That can be done to any businessman in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, having listened to the hon. member for Jeppes, one would say that what he was pleading for, was a human life, or that something terrible is being done here. One would have thought that what was at stake, was the survival of the companies he was pleading for. He raised a hue and cry as the champion of large companies. I do not think this is such a terrible thing as the hon. member tried to make this hon. Committee believe this afternoon. Surely, evidence has been submitted to the commission of inquiry to the effect that of the four companies entitled to do business on the Stock Exchange only three have, in fact, availed themselves of this opportunity to a limited extent. As far as the remaining company is concerned, it was really a dormant right of which little use was made. That is point number one. The second point which has been raised and in respect of which evidence has been submitted, was to the effect that those companies only held nominal representation on the floor of the Stock Exchange through one person they have had there.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct. Sound evidence has been submitted to this Committee to the effect that the Stock Exchange Committee should be in a position to apply a certain measure of discipline, but that it is very difficult to exercise this discipline over a company and over a public company in particular. Here we have the case where an official acts on behalf of the company. If anything goes wrong with such a company, he can blame the official for it. So much as far as the question of companies as such is concerned.</p>

<p>All four companies are large companies which do not, in the normal course of their business, carry on business as stockbrokers. They merely enjoyed this right as an additional right, but they did not utilize it to the full. As a matter of fact, they did not utilize it at all. We have the position here that there are four companies which enjoy the sole privilege of being able to carry on business on the Stock Exchange while there are numerous other companies of the same nature in South Africa which carry on business of the same nature but cannot obtain those rights. As against that, very sound representations <span class="col_8895-8896" refersTo="page_1581"/>have been submitted to the commission to the effect that established rights can, in fact, be taken away from individuals or companies by Parliament from time to time. Adequate evidence has been submitted to the commission in this regard. I have here in my hand representations which have a bearing on this aspect of the matter, but I do not want to repeat it here, thus wasting the time of the committee. The commission has subsequently recommended that the companies&#x2019; membership of the Stock Exchange be terminated as from this year. But the hon. the Minister has extended the membership of those companies for a further seven years, i.e. until 1978, In other words, those companies are placed in the position where they can regulate their affairs over a period of seven years so that they will not feel the effect of the termination of their membership. Honestly, it was really not necessary for the hon. member for Jeppes to raise such a hue and cry about such a minor matter as this.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just sat down was a member of that Stock Exchange Commission. He surely cannot deny that a very powerful case was put up by these three trust companies. They were led by eminent counsel. They gave us information of experience which they gained when their counsel went to other Stock Exchanges overseas. They put up a very impressive case. It is fundamental that rights are being taken away from companies who have enjoyed those rights for over 50 years. The hon. member suggested that it is not possible to discipline companies, but how has the Stock Exchange managed over the past 50 years? Surely, in other parts of the world it is possible to discipline corporate bodies. It is still possible to discipline corporate bodies in this country when they run foul of regulations and laws. It is a weak argument to suggest that it is not possible to discipline a corporate body in dealing with the employers of the company. It is not a sound argument. For more than 50 years the Stock Exchange has been able to discipline its members irrespective of the fact whether they were private individuals or corporate bodies. We are taking away right which have been enjoyed for many years. Because these are fundamental rights, we think that it is unfair and unjust to remove these rights for the reasons given by the hon. member for Parktown in his opening remarks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, hon. members have waxed very eloquent here about the right which these companies have had since 1888 to act as brokers on the Stock Exchange. The hon. member for Jeppes in particular became hot under the collar about this right which one of these companies has had since 1888 until the present, and which will now be taken away from it. But an aspect which was not advanced at all here, is that when these three companies became members of the Stock Exchange, the one in 1888 and the last in approximately 1928, they differed fundamentally from the companies they are today. The hon. member for Jeppes said that even now they only do 3 per cent of the business on the Stock Exchange. That I readily admit. But one must of course always be prepared for what can happen. Now it so happens that Parliament does not deprive people of their rights without a good reason. But it is just as true that Parliament should see to it that its citizens are given equal treatment and that there is no discrimination. In this case there is definitely discrimination. It must be terminated. Allow me to mention one example of discrimination. The rules of ethics of the Stock Exchange state expressly that a broker may not advertise his enterprise. But these companies advertise their enterprises every day. When an investor who wants to invest his money goes to these companies to do so, he can very easily be referred to their brokerage section. Their brokerage section does not advertise, but they advertise their business as deposit-receiving institutions, as an institution which invests the savings of the public. Then the public are urged to make use of their brokerage section. At that specific stage it may just be that the best form of investment is in shares. When an investment section now advises the client that he cannot do better at this stage than to invest his savings in shares, it will most certainly not recommend another broker, but its own brokerage section. This is nothing else but advertising its own brokerage business. That, however, the other brokers may not do. That is why I say that there is very definitely discrimination here. None of us can foresee how these companies may change in character through takeovers and amalgamations, for they may <span class="col_8897-8898" refersTo="page_1582"/>become large investment institutions which to a large extent have the savings of the public in their hands. It is by no means impossible that these brokerage sections of the companies will expand to such an extent that it will not remain at 3 per cent, but that it could subsequently include the lion's share of that work. The most important reason why I want to see the membership of these three companies terminated, is because we must ensure that all the citizens of our country are accorded equal treatment, although we would not like to tamper with their rights. That is why I support the abolition of the membership of these four companies, the one of which is, of course, completely dormant. In fact, if there is anything I regret, I would rather regret the fact that the hon. the Minister wants to give them a further seven years.</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say I find this clause to be a complete anachronism in what can otherwise be called a good Bill in most respects. It may not be as good a Bill as the Bill which was presented to the Minister by the commission, but it is a good Bill and it is an improvement in regard to the provisions governing the Stock Exchange which have existed previously. But, I regard this clause as being a complete blot in this Bill. I say that because on the one hand this clause is depriving existing businesses, if they are corporations in the normal sense of the word, of their right to trade and on the other hand it is depriving the public of the right to do business with businesses which have been serving them for a very long time. Unlike the <i>Financial Mail</i>, which has shrugged this clause off as being an unimportant aspect of this legislation I consider this abolition of the rights of the corporations to trade on the Stock Exchange a very important aspect. I consider it very important because it affects fundamental rights. Surely. Parliament is here to protect fundamental rights rather than to destroy them. I think most of the arguments for the abolition of corporate membership of the Stock Exchange and most of the arguments against that abolition have already been raised. However, there are certain additions I would like to make to them. One of the main arguments in favour of the abolition of corporate membership of the Stock Exchange, has been that due to the fact that existing members are part of other larger organizations who have diverse interests in finance, mining, industry and commerce, the fear exists that they are going to grow in a sort of octopus manner until they exercise a dominant or even a monopolistic influence on the Stock Exchange. That is something which I do not fear. These companies, as has already been said, have been in existence for a long time and the best they have been able to do to the present is to be able to dominate the Stock Exchange to the extent of 3 per cent of its turnover. In addition, where we have examples of corporate members of stock exchanges, established and accepted, as they are, on certain Continental stock exchanges, like Amsterdam, Zurich, and most of the German stock exchanges, there has been no tendency on the part of those corporate members to dominate their stock exchanges.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#langley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. LANGLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Are there individual members on those stock exchanges?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, there are individual members on the stock exchanges of both Zurich and Amsterdam.</p>

<p>The second argument which has been raised in favour of the abolition of corporate members has been that their membership should be abolished, because other companies are not going to be allowed to gain membership of the Stock Exchange. I feel that the pertinent question in this regard is: What harm is being done to other companies that are not members of the Stock Exchange while these three remain members? If there is no harm, and I can see no harm being done to other companies, why should they not retain their membership? To abolish their membership just because other companies do not have membership, to me seems a pure dog in the manger attitude. In any case, Stock Exchange membership. by its very nature, is a limited membership. It is a limited membership as far as individuals are concerned; why should it not also be a limited membership as far as corporations are concerned?</p>

<p>Then it has been said that corporate members have an unfair advantage over other members, because, being part of larger organizations which are interested in other activities, such as the investment of clients&#x2019; money, they enjoy particular advantages over their competitors in so far as they enjoy the captive business of the investments which they do for clients, and they <span class="col_8899-8900" refersTo="page_1583"/>enjoy the backwash of advertising done by other parts of their organizations. I admit that those are advantages which corporate members of the Stock Exchange do enjoy; but they have enjoyed those advantages for a very long time, and I have not noticed any harm being done to other members of the Stock Exchange by their enjoying them. Surely, what matters more than the position of the other members of the Stock Exchange is what the position of the public is. Would the public be hurt by these corporations remaining members of the Stock Exchange and enjoying these so-called &#x201C;unfair&#x201D; advantages?</p>

<p>Then there are, I think, a whole array of arguments in favour of the retention of these members as corporate members of the Stock Exchange. The argument that they have vested interests in the Stock Exchange, I think, has already been fully covered by other speakers on this side. I would only like to add that during this session this same principle of the protection of vested interests has been admitted by the Government. It was admitted by the hon. the Minister of Health in the debate on the Chiropractors&#x2019; Bill. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">Why, then, allow those who are practising to continue? I want to tell hon. members why. It is because we in South Africa have always respected vested interests.</block>

<p>This is from Hansard, Column 4026. I would suggest that this is a principle which should be strenuously protected by this House.</p>

<p>Then, in favour of retention of corporate membership the argument of what is in the interests of the public comes to the fore. I think this is a cardinal argument. We are much more concerned in this House with what is in the interests of the public than what is in the interests of other stockbrokers. Corporate members who are part of larger organizations interested in investing their clients&#x2019; money, conduct such activities as investment management, company management, banking, merchant banking, property development, and so on. Because they do those things they are usually in a position to give very sound and informed advice to their clients. Some maintain elaborate and costly research departments which could not be maintained by most ordinary brokers because they are too costly. They can be maintained by corporations on account of the fact that they can spread the costs over their other investing activities. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can give the hon. member for Constantia the assurance that the Select Committee did not arrive at this decision very lightly. I want to acknowledge that the hon. member for Pinetown is right when he says that these companies submitted all the necessary particulars to us as a Select Committee. The first important decision the Select Committee had to take was whether it was in the interests of the country that the membership of companies should be expanded and whether the committee should allow other companies as well to become members of the Stock Exchange. On that point the Select Committee was unanimous that we should not expand the membership of companies of the Stock Exchange further, since it was not in the interests of the country. When we reached an unanimous decision on this matter, that we were not going to give membership on the Stock Exchange to other companies, we also had to decide whether the present members had vested rights or contractual rights. In my humble opinion these four members had contractual rights. Let us now take the first one, i.e. Barclays Bank. Barclays Bank never even made use of its rights on the Stock Exchange. Let us now consider the other three companies. They had only limited rights, and the rights the Opposition now want to give them are also limited. Their rights on the Stock Exchange were limited to such an extent that they only had one person on the floor of the Stock Exchange, doing business for them. What did this right actually mean to them? Nothing. This one person was nothing more than an observer. According to the evidence submitted to us the representative of those companies was merely an observer and he was unable to do any business. because one needs at least four or five persons on the floor in order to do business. Is that not true? The hon. member for Jeppes must now tell us whether one man on the floor means anything. Hon. members of the Opposition do not want to give them full rights; they want to give them limited rights. Sir, let us go on. The Stock Exchange Committee is the body which has already, in terms of their regulations, limited the rights of these companies; <span class="col_8901-8902" refersTo="page_1584"/>they have already done this, and the United Party wants to allow this to continue. Sir, are we not creating a monopoly for these four companies here? If hon. members are not prepared to give companies the right to become members of the Stock Exchange, then surely we are creating a monopoly for these companies. The brokers of the Republic of South Africa want to build up a profession on which they can be proud, and you can only apply discipline to an individual; you cannot apply discipline to a company. I am asking those hon. members: How can the Stock Exchange apply discipline to a large company like Syfrets?</p>

<p>No, that hon. member knows that that is not true.

If those hon. members say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, then they must also say that they are going to allow other companies to become members of the Stock Exchange; if they do not, they are being unfair and unjust towards all the other companies in the Republic of South Africa.

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan has advanced some curious arguments and I would like to deal with some of them. First of all, he is suggesting that the Government cannot allow the present corporate members to remain members of the Stock Exchange, because that would be creating a monopoly. Sir, this is precisely what this Government did earlier on this session with the Chiropractors Bill. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of Health is in the House at the moment, because we pointed out to the Government and to this House at the time, that by limiting the Chiropractic Act to present practitioners, the Government was in effect creating a monopoly for those practitioners. If the Government is prepared to do that in respect of chiropractors on the sole ground that the Government does not wish to transgress the vested rights of present practitioners, why is the case different in respect of corporate members of the Stock Exchange? This is what we, on this side of the House, and the country generally would like to know. This Government seems to have a curious attitude towards vested rights, and we would like to know exactly what is its attitude and its principle in regard to vested rights. It seems to us that it has no principles in regard to vested rights. When it suits them, they recognize vested rights, as the hon. the Minister of Health did; despite the fact, I wish to point out, that the hon. the Minister of Health spent most of his time criticizing the chiropractic profession, pointing out that they were not fully qualified and that they were in effect a danger to the public.</p>

Sir, I challenge the hon. member for Brakpan, I challenge the hon. the Minister and I challenge any member on that side of the House to tell this Committee in what way the Stockbroking practice of corporate members is to the detriment of the public. Because surely, Sir, the whole issue is the public interest, not the interests of the other members of the Stock Exchange Obviously the other members of the Stock Exchange want to do away with corporate membership, but what we want to know from the Government is this: Do they suggest that the practice of corporate members on the Stock Exchange is to the detriment of the public interest.</p>

This is the issue: Whether they should be allowed to continue or whether (heir membership should be terminated arbitrarily? If hon. members on that side of the House claim that they are so concerned about protecting vested interests, as the hon. the Minister of Health told us that the Government was, in the case of the chiropractors, then perhaps the hon. the Minister of Finance will tell us today whether he does not accept this principle which the hon. the Minister of Health presented to this House, and if he does not accept it, why he does not.</p>

<p>Very well, Mr. Chairman, I will not go further, but I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will tell us. Sir. none of the Government members who have taken part in the debate on this clause has suggested that these corporate members have abused their position or have acted in a way which is contrary to the public interest. That being so, I believe that it is a sound principle that the vested rights which they have should be maintained.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan made the point that the method of practice of these corporate members of the Stock Exchange is limited; that they have only one person on the floor of the Exchange. Sir, that may or may not be the case. It may be that their practice on the Stock Exchange is not as full as that of an individual member, but if they are satisfied with that limited form of practice on the Stock Exchange and they wish to preserve it, surely they ought to be entitled to do so, even though their method of practice may not be the same as that of another member of the Stock Exchange. Sir, that is no reason for terminating their practice. I hope that the hon. the Minister will give us some reasons to justify the attitude of the Government, particularly in the light of the strong case made by the hon. the Minister of Health for the preservation of vested rights when he introduced the Chiropractors Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. member for Musgrave claims that this side of the House does not take vested rights into account, I am afraid that I have to say, with great respect, that he does not know what he is talking about. He also said by implication that the majority report of the Commission did not take vested rights into account. His colleagues who served on that Commission must have informed him that the Commission did in fact deliberate thoroughly and for a very long time on this very matter of vested rights. In fact, the Commission went so far as to recall advocates from Johannesburg to inform the Commission fully on the different legal principles which have to be applied when vested rights are being tampered with. The original majority report of the Commission was in principle that company membership should be terminated, and because vested rights were to a certain extent being tampered with, it was allowed, by way of compensation, that commissions could be shared for a period of seven years. The hon. the Minister has now decided that, in spite of the fact that the Commission suggested that membership be terminated immediately, he would have liked to have gone even further as far as vested rights are concerned. He then decided that company membership as such be allowed to continue for a further seven <span class="col_8905-8906" refersTo="page_1586"/>years. After all, this was granted to those companies by way of compensation in view of the fact that they would subsequently lose their membership. I therefore reiterate, with all due respect, that the hon. member for Musgrave did not know what he was talking about when he made that statement. I am in complete agreement with the hon. member for Brakpan that it is not easy to discipline a company. When a company who has membership on an exchange grows to such an extent that it can swallow up other companies, one eventually finds a tremendously expanded system of company interests which have a member on the Exchange, and it is to the detriment of public interest that this should happen. That is why I too support this standpoint of the Minister, that the membership of the companies shall be terminated after seven years,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Prinshof appears to think that the dispensation that these companies have been granted, namely that their membership will not be terminated for another seven years, is satisfactory. Personally, if I had had the death sentence passed on me, it would not matter to me very much whether the sentence was carried out now or in seven years&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to take up where I left off when my time expired during my last turn to speak. I was dealing with what I considered to be in the public interest as far as the retention of membership of the existing corporate members of the Stock Exchange was concerned. I was saying that these corporate members maintain very elaborate services in the form of research departments for the benefit of their clients, and these research departments can only be maintained by these larger organizations because they are able to spread their costs not only over their Stock Exchange activities, but also over other investing activities in which they are involved. The public does not have to pay any more for these services. That, I think, is what is important. I do not think anybody will deny the value of soundly based advice as a result of careful and detailed research, when it comes to making wise investment decisions.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I should like to come back to a further argument that I feel is important as far as the retention of membership by these companies on the Stock Exchange is concerned. That is that although this Bill makes fairly detailed provisions to ensure that members of the Stock Exchange will be financially sound, it is the corporate members of the Stock Exchange which are probably the strongest financially, I think that it is an important thing and that is in the public interest, that you should have strong members of the Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>Finally, as an argument in favour of the retention of this membership, I would raw this Committee&#x2019;s attention to the practice in other countries. On the Continent of Europe corporate members are fairly widely accepted and established as members of the stock exchanges. Amsterdam, which is a fairly important stock exchange, compared with the size of Holland, has amongst its members 27 banks, 24 corporate members and 186 broking firms. Zurich, which has 27 members, has banks as the majority of those members. In the German stock exchanges only banks and savings banks may deal on the floor. In the Anglo-Saxon countries, the U.K. and the U.S.A., the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange are all recognizing the need to move in the direction of corporate membership, and not away from it. Individual members of those stock exchanges are finding it more and more difficult to raise the necessary capital to finance their businesses on an individual basis and are turning to a corporate form of organization. The largest stockbroker in the world, a firm by the name of Merrill Linch, of the New York Stock Exchange, is shortly to turn itself into a public company which will be quoted on its own stock exchange.</p>

<p>During this debate we have had the pros for the abolition of corporate membership of the Stock Exchange and we have had the cons. To my way of thinking, the most compelling arguments are those which affect. firstly, the fundamental matter of the deprivation of existing rights and, secondly, those which point to where the public interest lies, and not to where the stockbrokers&#x2019; interest lie. I find no difficulty at all in coming down on the side in favour of the retention of the existing corporate membership, and accordingly I will support this amendment.</p>

<p>hon. members on the opposite side of the House pleaded for the retention of the member <span class="col_8907-8908" refersTo="page_1587"/>ship of these bodies and the companies as brokers in a way which really caused one to think that they were pleading here for the life of those bodies.

<p>Do not anticipate me. What is at issue here is not the survival of those bodies. The hon. members all know that the brokerage business is only a part of the overall activities of those bodies. It is not as in the case of the chiropractors, or what have you, where one can take away a person&#x2019;s entire livelihood. This is a minor part of their activities, and this is the difference between a corporate member of the Stock Exchange and an ordinary member. An ordinary member, as person, is almost completely dependent for his existence on the fact that he is a member of a stock exchange, but a company is something else again. It has all kinds of other interests. Its income as a result of its membership of the Stock Exchange forms a very small part of its income. Its survival as such is not dependent upon participation in the Stock Exchange. There is a difference in principle between the membership of a company which gives part of its work to the Stock Exchange and a person who devotes his full attention to it.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps I should go back a little into the history of this matter. I do not think the facts are confidential, and therefore I may just inform hon. members about the origin of this Commission they are all discussing. Slightly more than a year ago, when mention was made of legislation in regard to the Stock Exchange in which the membership of these bodies would be removed, the then chairman of Syfret&#x2019;s requested an interview with me. He came to plead for the retention of these bodies as members of the Stock Exchange. I told him that I had not myself yet been properly informed about the pros and cons in regard to the membership of those bodies. We agreed there that we would refer the matter to a select committee or a commission of inquiry. The origin of this select committee, which subsequently became a commission of inquiry, was to the greatest extent attributable to the fact that we wanted to have his particular matter investigated. There were other minor matters which also had to be investigated, <i>inter alia</i>, the disposal among themselves of shares of ordinary companies, etc. This was however the principal matter which formed the basis of and the reason for a select committee&#x2014;subsequently a commission of inquiry&#x2014;being appointed. If I consider myself to be bound to any suggestion of the commission of inquiry, I would be bound most to this recommendation because I said, as it were, that I would allow myself to be led in my decision by their recommendation in this connection. This recommendation of the committee, of all their recommendations, is most binding on me. For that reason I cannot easily deviate from it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown again put a few questions here which we have already replied to previously. I should just like to reply to them again briefly. The hon. member asked where the pressure was coming from. According to hon. members my side had supposedly alleged that we had had pressure from other companies which also wanted to be accepted as members of the Exchange. The hon. member for Constantia approved in principle that other companies are also members of an exchange. He said that this happens on the stock exchanges of other countries. He said for example that in Zurich and in Germany there are other companies that are members. If we were to recognize that now. we would be approving in principle that other members could also subsequently be accepted. We would not allow this ourselves, but we would be leaving the door open to other companies to claim with justification subsequently that they should also be granted membership on the Exchange.</p>

<p>I want to give my friend, the hon. member for Parktown, the assurance that if these members remain members of the Exchange, the agitation will begin in our offices as soon as we return to Pretoria that this Act should be amended so that other companies, particularly financial companies, <span class="col_8909-8910" refersTo="page_1588"/>may become members of the Stock Exchange. The hon. member is not in the same position we are in. Requests have already been made to us, and these will increase, to the effect that other companies should also become members of the Exchange. The hon. member spoke here about the companies which have for so many years&#x2014;and this is important been members of the Exchange. These companies who are members of the Exchange at present and have been for a good many years, are in name but not in substance the same companies.</p>

<p>Hon. members will know that some of the companies have expanded during the course of years. They have purchased new interests and they are continually increasing in size until they become a vast complex of companies. It is not only one company which now has representation on the Exchange, but through them there are a growing number of trust companies in particular who are receiving representation on the Exchange. I maintain that this is not fair to other companies which do not have that advantage. But there is another argument which has not yet been mentioned here. Barclays Bank has now withdrawn, but some of these companies are associated with a banking institution. Now I should like hon. members to go to the South African Reserve Bank and hear their opinion on whether it is a good thing that a broker and a banker should be the same person. Is it a good thing that a firm of brokers and a firm of bankers should be associated? I think it is wrong in principle that a broker&#x2019;s firm should have close ties with a banker&#x2019;s firm.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which should be considered. The activities of some of these companies consists, almost solely, of dealing with estates, trusts and similar types of business. This gives them a great advantage over other brokers. I do not think it is fair towards other brokers that these firms should have that advantage. I want to make it clear that I have a great deal of respect for these companies. They are among the best companies in our country, and I have nothing against them as companies. It is no easy matter to terminate their membership, But I do not think it is the right thing to retain them, hon. members on the other side spoke about the rights of these people. But what about the rights of the people who do not have this? Why cannot they also have this?</p>

<p>Reference was made here to other countries. I have evidence here about New York, London and Toronto. I have mentioned it and I could quote it to you. It is evidence from the share markets of Toronto, New York and London to the effect that this type of company would never become a member. I do not know whether the Commission had this evidence. According to what I deduce from the hon. member for Jeppes, the Commission did not have that evidence before it.</p>

<p>You received it subsequently? We received the evidence and studied it. We have the absolute assurance that these companies would not qualify as members of the stock exchanges of London, New York and Toronto.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia spoke about other companies which were share brokers on the stock exchanges of other countries. But those stock exchanges are of an entirely different character. Those stock exchanges are principally controlled by companies because the shareholding in those countries is for the most part in the hands of companies, particularly banking and financial companies. I do not think that the hon. member wants to give our Stock Exchange that character. Then he is going completely against the resolution of the Commission that other companies should not be allowed. It is quite unthinkable that we should in this way change the character of our Exchange. But the argument of the hon. member for Constantia simply shows me the logical conclusion of this policy. If you allow these four companies to remain members of the Exchange, the logical conclusion is that of the hon. member for Constantia, i.e. that you will also be able to allow others because this can do the Exchange no harm. I think that I have with this dealt with the most important arguments and that we may as well proceed now.</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 57 and 58, to omit &#x201D; up to an amount specified in the rules referred to in subsection (3)&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The aim of this amendment is to make the brokers more fully responsible for any funds of the public which may find its way into their hands. We made our position very clear during the Second Reading stage. It is not necessary for me to add very much to what we said then. However, the hon. the Minister in bis reply to the Second Reading debate said that to ask all brokers to secure or guarantee the liabilities of other brokers is going too far. As he said, it was an overkill. If I understood the hon. the Minister correctly, he went on to say that it would be too dangerous. I think the hon. the Minister has put his finger on the whole point of this issue, namely that somebody has to take a risk here, however small the degree of risk may be. The question is: Who takes the risk? Does the public take the risk or do the brokers take the risk? In terms of the Bill as it is before us now, the brokers are free from all risks and the public are asked to take the risk, however small this risk may be. I go along with the hon. the Minister that the risk is a very small one; but that is not the point. Once there is any degree of risk, whatsoever, somebody has to take that risk. We say the public should not take the risk.</p>

<p>We made a number of suggestions in the course of the discussion of the Bill. We suggested, for example, that all moneys received for which securities could not be delivered, should be placed into a trust fund. That is a common procedure. But the members of the Stock Exchange had objections. They said that because of the volume of the turnover that took place on the Stock Exchange, because of the enormous amount of money that flowed into the Exchange on different days, it was just not possible for them, administratively. <span class="col_8913-8914" refersTo="page_1590"/>first to put the money in a trust account and then transfer it to other accounts. Whatever suggestions we made, unfortunately we found were unacceptable.</p>

<p>We suggested, for example, that brokers could cover their unlimited liability by taking out insurance policies. This is a normal thing. All of us who are professional men have at some lime or other taken out policies to cover ourselves in case of any problems that might arise as a result of our practice. This was also unacceptable. We have not been able to get the Stock Exchange to accept full responsibility for their members. The committee was unanimous that this should be done. I hope the hon. the Minister, even at this late stage, will regard this clause as one of the clauses in the Bill by which he is almost bound, as he was in regard to clause 11. We cannot accept the position that you can ask a person to pay for something, unless you can give him delivery. I do not want to expound on this question further; I made it quite clear in the Second Reading debate. We regard it as a basic principle of our law and we are not prepared to depart from it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to support the hon. member for Parktown in moving his amendment. The clause that was recommended in the report provided for the use of the words &#x201C;unlimited liability&#x2019;&#x2019;, but perhaps they sounded a little harsh. The Bill has therefore come forward with the clause in its present form, which provides that the fund shall be able to pay, after excursion, up to an amount specified in the rules, the liability that arises as a result of transactions carried out by members of the Stock Exchange. In other words, the person who purchases or sells is never really sure, in the event of anything going wrong with the finances of the broker, that he together with all the others who are involved. will receive in full the liability to them of the broker.</p>

<p>The rules will provide the limit of the amount for which the broker will be liable. The hon. the Minister did tell us that he had had discussions with the committee of the Stock Exchange and that there was a fund of R300 000 already in existence and that the fund would probably be increased to R500 000 and in due course to even more. Some provision would he made to ensure by insurance that in a case of insolvency there would be a liability of up to R100 000. But we have just had a case where a broker was involved to an extent of R250 000. The circumstances were rather extraordinary, but this man was nevertheless unable to meet his liabilities which has left some people in a rather unhappy position. In supporting this amendment I would like to suggest that the question of the limitation to the amounts should not be provided for in this clause. The new section 13C (1), inserted by clause 19, will then read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee of a Stock Exchange shall establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of the registrar, a fund out of which shall, after excussion of a stockbroker be paid, his liabilities arising out of the buying and selling of securities by him on behalf of other persons, while a member of such Stock Exchange.</block>

<p>The words &#x201C;up to an amount specified in the rules referred to in sub-section (3)&#x201D; should be omitted. This will then bring home to the broker the standard which is expected of him and the liability to which other members of the Stock Exchange will eventually find that they will have to subscribe in order to satisfy the liabilities of that broker. The most important aspect is the fact that the customer will be satisfied and that the public will receive full protection. The only case made out against this point of view by the hon. the Minister and hon. members on that side of the House, is that there has been only one case in recent years where a broker was unable to meet his liabilities. I do not think this is sufficient to establish the principle that the liability should not be unlimited. Finally I want to say that the fact that the commission of inquiry took a unanimous decision on this question of liability should, I think, satisfy the Minister of the concern they had in doing exactly what they felt was their purpose, namely, to bring a Bill which would evoke the public's confidence, the confidence that they would not lose their money through risks over which they had no control at all. I think in this case the hon. the Minister should take into account this important aspect of the confidence of the public and, furthermore, the guarantee to the public that they will not lose anything.</p>

<from><span class="col_8915-8916" refersTo="page_1591"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, hon. members on the opposite side are again levelling the accusation at us that we took a unanimous decision and that we are now deviating from that decision by acknowledging that the hon. the Minister is right in the change he has made. I do want to point out, however, that we took that decision on a premise which was not correct. The hon. member for Parktown indicated that that unlimited indemnification of the public could be obtained by means of insurance. We have since ascertained that no insurance company would consider selling such a policy. Therefore the bottom has dropped out of our argument and we have had to admit that other measures have to be taken to safeguard the public on the one hand, but which would not drive the brokers to insolvency on the other hand. One cannot get away from the fact that possible dishonesty is not limited to brokers; members of the public can also be guilty of dishonesty. One therefore has to try, on the one hand, to safeguard the public and, on the other hand, not to drive the brokers to insolvency, otherwise one will eventually not get people who are prepared to do the work of brokers. Sir, since having reported to the Minister, we have taken cognizance of the fact that in order to protect the public, the brokers have gone even further than the commission deemed practicable. Thus, for example, the Bill introduced by the commission provided that a broker could not transfer scrip deposited with him as security or otherwise, as security to a financial institution in order to raise money against it, except when the owner of those certificates gave him written permission to do so. The Exchange Committee has now gone further and laid down in their rules that that scrip may under no circumstances be pledged, not even with the written permission of the owner or holder, for the purpose of obtaining money from a financial institution, This, of course, affords much better protection to the public. In addition, the Exchange Committee now provides in its rules that a broker may use only up to 40 per cent of the value of those shares in order to speculate for himself. With all these measures, taken in conjunction, I am now satisfied that the public is being properly protected. There may still be a highly exceptional case where a member of the public may suffer a loss, but the entire Bill, seen as a whole, creates such a situation as to make it almost impossible now for a broker to speculate with the money of the public and to go insolvent in that way, as in the case which the hon. member for Jeppes mentioned, where a broker recently could not meet his liabilities and where members of the public suffered losses. This Bill as a whole makes that situation virtually impossible now. Because we are providing in clause 13 that payment must be made within seven days, far less gambling can now take place, and this also safeguards the public. Because less gambling can take place now, there is so much more stability and so much more security. The danger of a broker going insolvent and the public suffering losses as a result, is therefore virtually being reduced to zero.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply briefly and to say that I fully appreciate the concern of hon. members on that side about the security of the money which an investor places in the hands of a broker. But the proposal they have here, is exactly the same as the proposal of an unlimited fund; it is merely couched in different terms. It is six of one and half a dozen of the other; it amounts to the same. For the same reasons I rejected it in the Second Reading stage, I also have to reject it now. We are all concerned about the security of the investor, but this entire Bill from the first to the last page contains a whole series of safety measures to protect the investor. I think what the hon. member for Constantia said is quite correct, i.e. that this is a good Bill. We are not dealing with the old Act now; we have here a new Bill which in many respects introduces completely new safety measures for the investor and which ought to give us great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Sir, in the Committee the hon. member for Parktown raised the possibility of a trust fund. It appears to be impossible in this case, for various reasons, because the activities of a broker differ in nature from those of an attorney. Consideration has also been given to an insurance policy against insolvency, but this is also impossible, because one cannot ensure against insolvency. However, I say this proposed unlimited fund is unfair. It is unfair to the innocent broker. It tempts the other broker to overreach himself, and the innocent broker now has to contribute when all the <span class="col_8917-8918" refersTo="page_1592"/>creditors of the guilty brokers have to be paid out. I think, Sir, that we can keep to this and to the new section 13C. in terms of which a fund will have to be built up to the satisfaction of the Registrar. We shall see to it that in terms of that section a fund is built up which will be as strong as possible in order to meet all requirements without requiring unlimited liability from brokers.</p>

<heading>CUSTOMS AND EXCISE AMENDMENTBILL</heading>

<p>(Second Reading resumed)</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as is customary, the Bill before us covers the Board of Trade recommendations, the changes necessary to nomenclature and rates because of our membership of GATT, the Budget proposals of the hon. the Minister of Finance on customs and excise, and the <span class="col_8919-8920" refersTo="page_1593"/>Budget proposals on the sales tax. In addition, there is this year an amendment to our trade agreement with Rhodesia. In past years it has been the practice for us to support the Bill at Second Reading and to vote against the provisions of the Bill that are unacceptable to us in the Committee Stage. This year, although we subscribe to the Board of Trade's recommendations and to the tariff changes necessary in terms of GATT, I regret that we find the proposals in regard to customs and excise duty and the sales tax so objectionable and unacceptable that we are forced to vote against this Bill at Second Reading to express our opposition to these measures.</p>

<p>These customs and excise duties and the sales tax proposals are unacceptable to us for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the manner in which these proposals were announced or imposed. Until this year it had always been normal practice for the hon. the Minister of Finance to announce any changes in customs and excise duties or in sales tax, provided they were upward, in his Budget speech. All changes in the past were made at that particular point of time. Even if the new provisions were harsh, and even if they were not liked by the public, there was at least certainty in the minds of the public that the duties that were imposed would be imposed until the next Budget. But all this was changed this year. The hon. the Minister of Finance, presumably in the knowledge that the amount in additional taxes and duties that he was going to extract from the pockets of the public was going to be so large, clearly thought that if he tried to make all these extractions at one time, there would probably be such a public outcry that the people might even have gone so far as to call for his resignation, He therefore decided to pull one tooth at a time, and to get the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs in as his assistant. You see. Sir, contrary to established precedent again, the hon. the Minister of Finance dealt his shock to the country in his speech on the Second Reading of the Part Appropriation Bill, when he announced additional sales taxes amounting to R47 million. These are the duties we are being asked to approve in the Bill before us.</p>

<p>Now, having sufficiently tarnished his own reputation as regards taking funds from the pockets of the public, the hon. the Minister left the next move to his assistant, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>And he again did something very strange. He decided by way of a press release to tell the public what he intended to do. Two weeks before Budget day, on 15th March to be precise, he announced through the medium of a press release that with effect from 1st April, 1971, the day after Budget day, in addition to a rise in the price of petrol which he had agreed to give the oil companies and for which, of course, the public would pay, there was to be an additional duty of 0,3 cents per litre, or</p>

<p>1. 363 cents per gallon. This was to be imposed, as I have said, from 1st April, and this second extraction from the pockets of the public was estimated to amount to some R15 million.</p>

<p>By Budget day. on 31st March, with the help of the hon. the Minister of Transport, who had taken R58 million from the pockets of the public, and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, who had taken R49,8 million from the public, the hon. the Minister of Finance had got the public sufficiently anaesthetized to make his final extraction. This he did on Budget day, by taking from the public by way of new taxation a further R183 million. This amount included the new customs and excise duties, which amounted to no less than R63.58 million.</p>

<p>Now this was a very skilful operation by the hon. the Minister of Finance. But I want to tell him not to be under any illusions in regard to this matter. The overall shock to the taxpayer was severe indeed. In fact, as time goes on he feels the shock more and more. The anaesthetic is wearing off. The nerves have become exposed, and he is beginning to realize, and realize full well, exactly what these duties we are asked to pass this evening are going to mean to him. If the taxpayer himself does not realize the full implications of these new sales duties and tariff increases, he is hearing daily from his good wife all about them, because it is the good wives who are bearing the brunt of the additional taxes and duties which are being imposed by the Government, and it is to them that the hon. doctor is going to have to answer. Never, for many a year, has there been such a crescendo of complaints about the ever-increasing cost of living. Sir, it is an amazing thing that wherever you go today, in whatever sector of society, in whatever income group, you will find that there is only one topic of discussion. And what is this topic of discussion? The constant increase in the cost <span class="col_8921-8922" refersTo="page_1594"/>of living which is imposing an unbearable burden upon the shoulders of the people.</p>

<p>Now, statistics, it is true, may show that there is only a points rise in the cost of living, but since we discussed this matter in the House a little while ago the position has changed from 4,2, which was I think the final figure we settled on, to something of the order of 5,4 now. The hon. the Minister of Finance, of course, says that what we are dealing with here is one shock increase because of the new duties. I do not think this is going to be the case, unfortunately. I think we are going to see a constant increase in the cost-of-living index over the next six to nine months. If you talk to the housewife today, she will not talk to you in terms of fractional increases but she will produce the evidence to show how far her rand went, say, six months ago and what it has narrowed down to today. One hears a very different story from her. She will tell you that everything is costing more and more. The new duties that will be imposed if this Bill becomes law, will cover a very wide range of commodities and services indeed. The women of South Africa are not going to tolerate this much longer. We are beginning to see the signs of this already. We believe that the people are being called upon to carry an intolerable and unnecessary burden. We do not believe it is right or that there is any need for the public to pay duties of 11.5 cents on a bottle of wine that sells between 95c and R1-20; to pay duties of R2-23 on a bottle of whisky that sells for R4-50, which is just under 50 per cent; to pay Rl-48 on a bottle of brandy that sells for R2-75; to pay 7c to 9c on a bottle of beer that sells for 20c to 22c; to pay 6,64c on a packet of 10 cigarettes that one buys in the shop for 12c.</p>

<p>I can only deal with these duties. I cannot deal with the increase in the cost of living. I can only say how these duties are going to increase the cost of living. We do not believe that, when a young couple or anyone else decides to buy and furnish a house, they should be called on to pay duties of 15 per cent on the paint or wallpaper they use on their walls; 15 per cent on their furniture, even if it is built in; 15 per cent on the very beds and mattresses they must sleep on. These are not luxuries. They must pay 20 per cent on the carpets and rugs that go on the floor; 50 per cent on Venetian blinds if they want to cover their windows; 15 per cent on their tableware, which they need to eat off; 15 per cent on their cutlery; 15 per cent on glassware; 15 per cent on the stoves they must have; 15 per cent on a hotwater cylinder which everybody needs; and 15 per cent on any other kitchen equipment whatever it is from an eggbeater to a rasp. They must pay 15 per cent on a washing machine, 15 per cent on a dishwasher and 15 per cent on a sewing machine. What does the hon. the Minister think the women of South Africa are trying to do today? They are using their sewing machines in an attempt to bring costs down. Furthermore, people must pay 15 per cent on a lawnmower and 15 per cent on an electric light bulb. We are supposed to live in perpetual darkness under this Government. The people must pay 15 per cent on a refrigerator and to listen to the S.A.B.C.&#x2014;and this I am not altogether against when I think of some of the programmes&#x2014;they must pay a 30 per cent duty. The same applies for every flat dweller or house owner. Every time a flat dweller or house owner buys something, out of each R100 he spends, he can expect to pay approximately&#x2014;it is not easy to calculate&#x2014;R10 to the Government. Of that R100 he will have to pay perhaps R15 or R20 in excess because of the fact that the tax snowballs. By the time it gets to him, the amount he must pay is much more than just the tax. If a young couple want to furnish their lounge for R600, they can be sure they are giving the Government R60. In point of fact it is <span class="col_8923-8924" refersTo="page_1595"/>costing them R100 more because of the duties and the snowballing effect. It goes far beyond this, it is interfering with every facet of their lives today. The hon. member for Gardens made a plea to the hon. the Minister last year about the cosmetics for ladies. What did the hon. Minister do? He upped the duty by another 5 per cent to make it 30 per cent. He will have to answer to the ladies of South Africa one day and I would not like to be in his shoes. I am petrified of them. Every time they buy a piece of jewellery, even the cheapest costume jewellery, which they use to adorn themselves, they have to pay 30 per cent duty. If the husband wants to buy her a piece of jewellery as a present, he also has to pay 30 per cent. We are paying a duty on practically everything we buy today except on food and on clothing.</p>

<p>Yes, not on breathing either. Sales duties keep on going up and up. From the day the hon. the Minister introduced sale duties, in the main he has kept on putting them up from 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent to 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. Last year the Government wanted R116,9 million from the sales tax but it actually received R126 million. What does it want from us this year? It wants R173 million. This Government is getting greedier and greedier. Last year they wanted R45.5 million from beer, and what do they want this year? They want R63.5 million. Last year they wanted duty from wines to the tune of R8,8 million and this year they want R11,2 million. Last year they wanted R80 million from spirits and this year they want R113 million. And my hon. friends on that side of the House, the farmers, must not forget that spirits include brandy. I find it inexplicable. This very week the Government had to send the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs to England to try to deal with the position of GATT and the EEC. While our wine and spirit exports are in jeopardy, the hon. the Minister slaps on additional taxes to the order of R3 million, R7 million, R10 million or R12 million. This is what he is doing to the wine farmers. Not only is the position in so far as it concerns the European economic community in jeopardy; he is also slapping on a tax to stop people from buying these products locally. Go and tell the people of Paarl what the hon. the Minister is doing to our farmers in regard to their exports which are already in jeopardy, when he turns the screw on and says: &#x201C;Never mind about that, let us impose a further lax locally&#x201D;. It is another case whereby we can illustrate that the Ministers of Finance and Economic Affairs of the Nationalist Party do not know what the other one is doing. The hon. the Minister of Finance imposes a local excise duty whilst the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs runs overseas to try to protect the position. Nothing makes sense any more. Last year the Government wanted to take from all sources of customs and excise as well as sales duty R649 million. This year they want R820 million. This is an increase of R171 million. Who is going to foot the bill? The taxpayers are going to foot the bill. We have now reached the stage where what was previously part of our normal life, has come to be regarded as a luxury because of the sales duty. If you want a watch today, you have to pay 30 per cent duty. It is unbelievable. Everybody needs a watch! For a suitcase you pay 15 per cent duty, on a brief case 15 per cent duty, on a lady&#x2019;s handbag 15 per cent and on a pair of sun glasses&#x2014;just imagine, a pair of sunglasses! &#x2014;20 per cent duty. On a camera you pay 30 per cent duty. The hon. the Minister will not only have to answer to the ladies, he will have to answer to the small boys who want cameras when they turn 12 or 13 years of age. On a gramophone you pay 30 per cent duty and on a gramophone record 30 per cent as well. Every time we buy our grandchildren a toy we have to pay 15 per cent duty.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are not living in the age of prosperity in this country any more&#x2014;we are living in an age of austerity. That is the difference. Whatever you buy and whatever you use&#x2014;somewhere along the line there is a State duty. There is no duty on the food you eat. but there is on the plate you eat off and on the knife and fork you use. You pay duty on those articles. It is not on your rent, but it is on the bed on which you sleep and the carpet on your floor. You do not pay it on clothes, but if you wear a watch, you pay it. If you have a pen in your pocket, you pay on it. If you have a belt around your waist, you pay on it. As I said, if <span class="col_8925-8926" refersTo="page_1596"/>a lady is carrying a handbag, she is paying on it. You do not pay on electricity in your home, but you pay on your light fittings.

<p>Which he should have done years ago. This is the interesting point. This Government has a very strange economic philosophy. If you spend money in the private sector, it is inflation; but if you spend money in the public sector, it is not inflationary. You see, the hon. the Minister has said that he did not regard the Budget as being inflationary. Once again the hon. the Minister stands alone, because every other economist in the country believes the Budget to have been inflationary. We believe these duties are inflationary. When you put on additional duties on commodities, you are creating inflation. As I said just now, we have already seen this inflation rise to 5,4 per cent and worse is to come. We can see no solid foundation for these increases in duty &#x2014;on the contrary, we can see many reasons for voting against the measure, which we are going to do. We know that voting against the Second Reading of the Customs and Excise Bill is unusual, but we believe profoundly that the time has come when we have to demonstrate quite clearly that we do not like these duties and we reject them completely out of hand.</p>

<p>We are not only rejecting these duties for the man in the street. We reject them because they do harm to our economy, the expansion of our economy and our development. Most important of all, we reject them because they hit hardest against the people who can least afford to bear these increases, our non-European population. We are taking away every simple pleasure from our people. We have heard in debates that have just gone past some of the troubles about which we have to think for the future. Today you are taking away from the non-European the little pleasures he has left a cigarette, a pipe, trinket, and perhaps even that insignia of his success, his briefcase which he carries so proudly. These new duties mean tightening the belt round stomachs that in many cases are already empty. We shall vote against this Bill. There will be no other speakers in this Second Reading debate because when we move on to the Committee Stage we will have ample opportunity of indicating in detail those duties which cause us the greatest concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I looked at hon. members on the opposite side while the hon. member for Parktown was speaking, I realty gained the impression that they were hearing this story for the first time. This story is exactly as old as the length of my stay in this House, i.e. two years, If there were someone sitting in the gallery today who did not know the living conditions and standards in South Africa, he would have thought that this was the worst country in the world in which to live. The picture which the hon. member for Parktown painted here today, would have given <span class="col_8927-8928" refersTo="page_1597"/>such a person the impression that there was nothing here but absolute exploitation of the citizens of this country. He could not have gained any other impression than that the cost of living in South Africa is a record in the world at the present moment. From the picture painted here by the hon. member for Parktown he would not have been able to believe that the cost-of-living index in South Africa is among the lowest in countries which can be compared with South Africa&#x2014;this has been said here so often that I actually feel uneasy to repeat it. What is all this about? I think I can say what this is all about in the two minutes I still have at my disposal. A struggle is being waged here against that same cost-of-living inflation about which the hon. member waxed so eloquent here. This Government is waging this struggle by its methods, which are ones with which the hon. the Opposition disagrees. However, these are fiscal and monetary methods that are known throughout the world. The Opposition, again, has a different plan, with which we do not agree. What is incorporated in this Customs and Excise Bill, is nothing but a part of that combating process. The hon. member for Parktown knows that since 1969 the public of South Africa started spending unusually heavily, particularly on durable consumer goods. He knows that this is proved by the available statistics and he also knows that this exceptionally heavy expenditure has resulted in a new stimulus and an increase in our cost-of-living index. Tin's must happen; it cannot be otherwise when the demand increases to the extent to which it has without there being a parallel increase in production, Nevertheless, the hon. member for Parktown makes no mention of this. The hon. member for Parktown knows that this expenditure in the Budget had to be incurred, and that this revenue had to be found for the purposes of the infrastructure. He also knows that if we do not act this way in order to curb demand, that money will have to be found by way of foreign loans, for example. That money will have to be brought in from abroad and that will have a very inflationary effect, just the opposite of what is in actual fact being achieved. I think in these few words I have covered the speech made by the hon. member for Parktown to the best of my ability.</p>

<heading>PRICE MAINTENANCE IN RESPECTOF PNEUMATIC TYRES (REPORT OFTHE BOARD OF TRADE ANDINDUSTRIES)</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, earlier today I tabled Report No. 1262 (M), Part V, of the Board of Trade and Industries on resale price maintenance in respect of pneumatic tyres, and I should like to make a brief statement in that regard.</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, a general prohibition of the maintenance of resale prices was announced in our country on 25th June, 1969. However, at the time a number of commodities, which included pneumatic tyres, were exempted from the prohibition on a temporary basis in order to afford the Board of Trade and Industries an opportunity to complete its investigation into the applications for exemption which had been received from interested parties.</p>

<p>In Part V of its Report No. 1262 (M), which was tabled in this House today, the Board of Trade and Industires recommended that pneumatic tyres should not be exempted from the general prohibition of resale price maintenance.</p>

<p>The system of maintaining resale prices, as it is being applied in the case of pneumatic tyres, has the disadvantage of restricting price competition among manufacturers and also of eliminating this competition among dealers, whilst consumers are denied the advantages of such competition. On the other hand, the said system has the advantage of promoting competition in respect of the quality of locally manufactured pneumatic tyres, which includes the durability, safety and retread ability of these tyres, and of ensuring stable conditions in the manufacture and the distribution of pneumatic tyres as well as in the rendering of service to consumers.</p>

<p>These advantages and disadvantages involved in resale price maintenance in respect of pneumatic tyres, should be weighed up when a decision is taken as to whether or not the system is to be terminated.</p>

<p>On the strength of several considerations mentioned in the report, the Board of Trade and Industries arrived at the conclusion that the prices of pneumatic tyres would, in the absence of resale price maintenance, be lower than was the case at present. This board also held the view that the abolition of resale price maintenance in the case of pneumatic tyres would not eliminate to any appreciable extent such advantages as were in fact implied by the system, but that the abolition of the system would, in essence, merely bring back the undertakings and risks involved in a normal market economy in the marketing of pneumatic tyres.</p>

<p>However, I must point out that the manufacturers&#x2019; selling prices of pneumatic tyres can be controlled effectively by the Government if it appeared that the present situation gave rise to serious abuse. Further to this matter it should be borne in mind that in an oligopolistic market condition, as prevails in the case of pneumatic tyres, it is by no means inevitable that the abolition of resale price maintenance will give rise to effective price competition. It is equally possible that a price leader would come to the fore, a leader who would be followed by the other manufacturers, and this would give rise to results which would not differ fundamentally from what was the case under resale price maintenance.</p>

<p>If price competition were in fact to develop, it would be quite possible that a reduction in the prices would be attended by a proportionate decline in the quality of pneumatic tyres, the result being that the consumer would actually be receiving less value for his money, i.e. in the form of the number of kilometres he could cover per tyre. What is more, it is to be expected that the consumer, in the absence of resale price maintenance, would be exposed to a variety of undesirable practices, such as misleading advertisements, artificially high listed prices with deceptive discounts, as well as the supply of lower-grade tyres, as did occur in overseas countries where resale price maintenance had been abolished.</p>

<p>I also considered the effect of the abolition of resale price maintenance in respect of pneumatic tyres on the branch of industry in question and on allied industries, and I arrived at the conclusion that such a step would in all probability have disruptive consequences for the tyre manufacturing <span class="col_8931-8932" refersTo="page_1599"/>industry itself, the local suppliers of raw materials to the industry as well as the distributors of tyres.</p>

<p>In the light of the said considerations it is still, as far as I am concerned, by no means a foregone conclusion that, all things considered, the abolition of resale price maintenance in the case of pneumatic tyres will in fact, on balance, be in the public interest. Consequently I have decided, for the time being, against implementing the recommendation made by the Board of Trade and Industries, i.e. that the temporary exemption of pneumatic tyres from the general prohibition of resale price maintenance should be withdrawn.</p>

<p>However, I want to issue a word of warning to the tyre manufacturers. To my mind the profits realized by the industry are particularly good, and in some cases they are possibly even higher than can be justified on economic grounds. Moreover, there are indications that the same criteria are not always being applied when it comes to the degree of latitude allowed to the larger and the smaller distributors, respectively, in regulating their affairs.</p>

<p>The manufacturers must therefore accept that their actions will be followed with critical interest, and if, in due course, it appears to be desirable, I shall not hesitate to give effect to the recommendation made by this board.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I rise to deal immediately with the Agliotti affair, an affair about which, I may say, we do not have all the facts that we ought to have, a matter which stinks to high heaven.</p>

<p>Sir, it is necessary, I think, for the House to have in chronological order the salient facts relating to this affair. Very briefly the facts are that in February, 1965, Agliotti&#x2014; and I will refer to Agliotti and his company as &#x201D; Agliotti&#x201D; &#x2014;bought the properties concerned for R93 600, and additions were then made to them. Thereafter he made every effort to sell these properties: he was very anxious to do so. In 1964 he applied for a re-zoning of these properties, which necessitated a valuation, and a valuation of something like R840 000 was put on his properties. He objected and said that they should in fact be valued at only R109 000. Then in March, 1969, he concluded an agreement with a firm called Lideor. He signed a conditional agreement of sale in terms of which he disposed of the properties for R1&#x00BD; million. Sir, throughout this period the State was aware of this firm and of the property because of various applications that were made to Bantu Affairs and to Planning.</p>

<p>Then in October, 1969, the Department of Transport decided that it wanted to expropriate the property for the purpose of extending Jan Smuts Airport. This was conveyed to the Department of Land Tenure in November, 1969. They wanted the property less 120 morgen, but Mr. Venter, the administrative officer of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, recommended to the Department of Transport that the whole of the property be bought. The consulting engineers, acting on an untruth on the part of Mr. Venter, recommended to the Minister of Transport that the additional 120 morgen should be bought. That was then authorized by the hon. the Minister with specific instructions that the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure had a thorough investigation made into the alleged clay content. The so-called Prof. Lombaard and Mr. Behr were then called in. They were not told the real purpose of the report and indeed Prof. Lombaard says had he known what the purpose was, he would have made further inquiries and would not have accepted the information given to him. Anyway, Sir, they then placed a valuation upon the clay content.</p>

<p>Then in February, 1970 the adminstrative officer of this department. Mr. Venter, made a recommendation and a submission to the Land Tenure Board that although R8&#x00BC; million was requested by Agliotti, R4&#x00BD; million approximately should be paid. At <span class="col_8933-8934" refersTo="page_1600"/>that stage he ascertained that there was money under Loan Vote D, Assistance to Farmers. However, that is where the money was, and that is where it was apparently taken from. On 1st March, a Sunday, he has what he describes as an &#x201C;ingewimg&#x201D;, an inspiration or idea, whereby he conceives the idea that Agliotti should receive in fact R6,l million, instead of R4,5 million. On 3rd March the Land Tenure Board met, and the board, in the most extraordinary circumstances described in the report, which will be dealt with by other hon. members, accepted the new thoughts of Mr. Venter on the basis that they should pay R6,l million. Two days later, on 5th March, Mr. Venter saw a Mr. Neethling of the State Attorney&#x2019;s Office to make inquiries about the value that should be placed upon clay. On the very same day there was an extraordinary meeting of the Secretary of the Department, the Deputy Secretary and Mr. Venter, and at the suggestion of Mr. Venter they upped the amount the I and Tenure Board had agreed on two days before, namely R6,l million, by another R1,4 million approximately. If you take into account the R800 000 that the Land Tenure Board took off, it would be an increase of R2,2 million approximately; and this in a manner described by the Commissioner as &#x201C;arbitrary and involving an arithmetical error&#x201D;. On that very same date, on the same day of this extraordinary meeting, the expropriation order was served on Agliotti; on the same day the cheque was issued, and on the following day. March 6th, Friday, the cheque was handed to Agliotti.</p>

<p>Now, on March 6th, according to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, he heard about the deal for the first time. He and the Deputy Minister had talks with Dr. Henning, the Chairman of the Land Tenure Board, about high prices the State was paying for land, and they specifically mentioned the Agliotti deal. On that very same day the hon. the Minister said he called in the Secretary of the Department Mr. Viljoen, and then called for the file and tried to stop the cheque.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not correct. We tried to stop the payment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is right. He tried to stop payment of the cheque. But, he says, he was a day too late and he could not do it, I will come to that in a moment. I will deal with that specifically just now. I just want to set out the facts now.</p>

<p>On 8th March, two days later, the Nationalist Sunday newspaper, <i>Die Beeld</i>, for the first time raises the matter in public and you will remember what it said, Sir: How wonderful it was, what a wonderful department we had, and are we not lucky that we got this land for only R7,5 million because if we had waited until 1985 goodness knows how much we would have had to pay. Anyway, that was the first time it was raised by this well-informed Nationalist Sunday newspaper. Now, according to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, on the Monday following <i>Die Beeld's</i> publication, on March 9th, there was a meeting of the Cabinet at which the matter was discussed. According to the hon. the Prime Minister, on 14th March, the following Saturday, there was a meeting of Nationalist candidates for the general election and Mr. Sias Reyneke, M.P., raised the Agliotti deal. He said there was something fishy about it and he gave specific reasons. The hon. the Prime Minister, in the result, decided to set up a commission of inquiry. That is his story.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>That is not a story; it is the truth.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Then on the very next day the <i>Sunday Times</i> came out with an article on its front page indicating the true facts of the Agliotti deal; indicating for the first time, as opposed to what <i>Die Beeld</i> had said, that a year before Agliotti had tried to sell it; he had offered and was prepared to sell this property for R1,5 million. And at midnight of the same night that the <i>Sunday Times</i> made this all important disclosure, that very night, a commission of inquiry was announced, to look into this deal.</p>

<p>During that inquiry, in early September, Agliotti agreed to pay back to the State approximately R5 million. On 16th September the matter was raised in this House by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition under the vote of the hon. the Prime Minister. As a result, the Prime Minister replied immediately, and his replies form a very important part of the whole picture involving him directly so far as responsibility for the state of affairs which has developed here is concerned. Then, according to the hon. the Minister of Police, the Prime <span class="col_8935-8936" refersTo="page_1601"/>Minister also ordered a police inquiry that month and a police investigation into the matter. The commission completed its report on 14th December, 1970. On 22nd January it was available to the Prime Minister for the first time. On that day the Government considered the report and on that day the Government referred the report to the Attorney-General of the Transvaal.</p>

<p>On 1st February the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised the matter again and the Prime Minister answered again. This is also an important part of the whole story.</p>

<p>During March or April Agliotti's passport was withdrawn, presumably as the result of the police inquiry. On 1st June Mr. Venter, involved in <i>mala fides</i> according to the finding of this commission, with Agliotti, left the country on a valid South African passport. Two days after that, on 3rd June, the report was laid on the Table of this House and made public. Why it took so long to translate it is another matter we would like to know. Why it was not laid on the Table before is yet another matter. Translation is certainly not the answer. We have our Hansard here translated within a week, with far more material than in the report. The report, as anyone now knows, found that there were the most serious irregularities on the part of the Secretary of the department, the Deputy Secretary of the department and the Chairman of the Land Tenure Board, and gross irregularities amounting to fraud on the part of Venter and Agliotti. Those, briefly, are the facts of the matter, and I am pleased that the hon. the Prime Minister is now in his seat.</p>

<p>I have indicated that in regard to some of the matters he is as responsible for this affair as much as anyone else. On 16th September, 1970, when this matter was first raised in this House by my hon. leader, what did the hon. the Prime Minister say? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The last question he put to me was in regard to the Agliotti affair. The Leader of the Opposition asked me how that land was being purchased. The land is being purchased, as I understand it always has been done, by that Land Tenure Board. This is a board which has been established. I need not explain the machinery. It buys the land.</block>

<p>Now, that is the grasp that the hon. the Prime Minister had of the situation.</p>

<p>He is wrong in fact and in law. In fact, under the Expropriation Act, the Minister expropriates; he has the power to expropriate. And under the Land Tenure Act the Minister may expropriate for fanning purposes only, or exchange land for farming purposes only, and the Land Tenure Board has no functions like this whatsoever. In fact, if you look at the Act you will see that it says that the functions of the board shall be &#x201C;to advise the Minister in regard to the value of land and any rights in or over land, the alienation and allocation of State land, and in regard to any other matter which the Minister may refer to the board.&#x201D; </p>

<p>That being the situation, the whole approach of the hon. the Prime Minister is based on a misunderstanding of the functions and of the position. In fact, the land is expropriated by a Minister who long ago assigned his powers to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of his department, so when the Prime Minister says in Column 4286&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the large amount involved here, this amount should have been brought to the notice of the Minister.</block>

<p>He was obviously quite unaware that the powers had already been assigned or delegated under a special general power of attorney to the Secretary and to the Deputy Secretary of the department, without any qualifications whatsoever. There were no qualifications whatsoever. So one wonders at this stage what it was, because it was in this month that the hon. the Prime Minister ordered the police investigation, and who it was and in what respect, and in what department and how he ordered that investigation by the Police. We would like to know that.</p>

<p>But this is very surprising, coming from the hon. the Prime Minister, who in that very same speech, in Column 4288, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unlike the hon. member, I am not a person who takes notice of street gossip. I prefer to look at the records.</block>

<p>Sir, what records was he going to look at? Apparently he did not know where to look. He nevertheless talked about the records in relation to two professors (Hansard, volume 30, column 4288-9)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8937-8938" refersTo="page_1602"/>According to the records, two professors of geology assessed the value of the land, since the point at issue was the clay content and the value of the clay, on which an ordinary sworn appraiser cannot make a valuation. They were the experts who made a valuation, and on the strength of their valuation that amount was determined. The one professor was from the University of the Witwatersrand and the other from the University of Pretoria.</block>

<p>Well, Sir, I am afraid that he was wrong again. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture told the House on Friday that the two persons who drew up the report were Prof. B. V. Lombaard and Mr. S. H. Behr, &#x201C;who were not attached to any university at the time&#x201D;. The hon. the Prime Minister at that stage therefore seems to have had a remarkably good grasp of the situation!</p>

<p>He talked in the same speech about the <i>Sunday Times</i> and said that he was not induced by its report of the 15th March to appoint a commission of inquiry. It was at the candidate&#x2019;s meeting of the 14th March, according to him, that Mr. Sias Reyneke raised the matter, This hon. gentleman, who is not concerned about street gossip, says that the matter was raised by Mr. Sias Reyneke, who said that there was something fishy about the matter. He continues (Hansard, Volume 30, column 4289)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At that conference of candidates he mentioned specific reasons for saying so. At the conference I told him and all the candidates that I would appoint a commission of inquiry, for these were the rumours that were circulating on the East Rand and in Boksburg.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister also talked about <i>Die Beeld.</i> I have already indicated what <i>Die Beeld</i> said.</p>

<p>At the time the hon. the Prime Minister had access to these records, and said: &#x201C;The fact of the matter is that everybody who can and could have shed light on this matter was summonsed to appear before the commission.&#x201D; This was after evidence had been led, and before argument before the commissioner was to follow, Is this in fact so? Was the hon. the Minister of Agriculture called? Was he called upon to explain why it was that he was never told about this matter? Was he called to explain how this state of affairs could exist in his department without his knowing anything about it? Was Mr. Sias Reyneke called before the commissioner? Was he called upon to shed light on why he thought the deal was fishy? He must have had a very convincing case, because the hon. the Prime Minister says that he was induced by that and the street gossip in Boksburg to appoint the commission. One also has the case of Mr. van der Merwe, M.P., from Meycrton. I do not know which hon. gentleman that is, but he is referred to in the Commission&#x2019;s Report as &#x201C;Mr. van der Merwe, M.P.. from Meyerton&#x201D;, He wrote a letter to the Minister of Transport, saying that Agliotti had not got his money&#x2019;s worth. This was referred to the Secretary, (Mr. Viljoen) and you will see in the report, Sir, that the Secretary wrote on it, after the event. &#x201C;Hier is iemand wat met ons saamstem&#x201D;, or words to that effect. Sir, have they been called? They are all fortunately here today, and perhaps they will be able to enlighten the House as to what has been happening.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another question for the hon. the Prime Minister. If he was convinced that there was something fishy and was prepared to go to the extent of setting up a commission of inquiry, why did he not also ask the Police to investigate the matter? He asked the Police to investigate the matter during September, while the commission was still sitting, and before it had reported. Why did he not, if this was so fishy, also order a Police investigation at that time? We should like to know.</p>

<p>I should also like to say that I find it odd, to say the least, that after the Police had been investigating the matter since September, 1970, one finds this sort of report, which appeared in the <i>Cape Times</i> on the 8th June, 1971: &#x201C;Brig. Burger said that he had no comment to make on the investigations at this stage, except that they will be very thorough&#x201D;. Then one finds the following report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 6th June. &#x201C;Gen. Danie Bester told me that detectives who belong to a special unit of the Police were making a thorough investigation into matters concerning the Agliotti affair.&#x201D; This is not the sort of comment one would have expected, had these investigations been pursued vigorously since September, 1970. We should like to know the result of these investigations.</p>

<p>Another very important question for the hon. the Prime Minister to answer in this regard is: How is it that although Agliotti&#x2019;s <span class="col_8939-8940" refersTo="page_1603"/>passport was withdrawn, Venter&#x2019;s was not? It must be borne in mind that Venter is, on the finding of the commission, guilty of being <i>mala fides</i> in cahoots with Agliotti, the implication being that they have defrauded the Stale. We should therefore like to know how it is that although Agliotti's passport was withdrawn, Venter was able to leave the country on a valid South African passport two days before the report was published. Sir, are we to believe that this happened despite the fact that there is a Cabinet decision on the matter, or a Government decision, of the 22nd January; despite the fact that the matter was referred to the Attorney-General; despite the fact that there have been Police investigations since September, 1970; despite the fact that, according to the Minister of the Interior, the Bureau of State Security is used to help in passport applications; despite all the machinery the Minister of the Interior told us about on Friday&#x2014;according to him the best in the world, second to none, as regards passport investigations; despite the fact Agliotti's passport was taken away; despite the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister himself said earlier this year that the report would soon be laid upon the Table and that those responsible would be dealt with according to law. That was the reason why the commission was appointed, he said.</p>

<p>How can this possibly happen? How did it happen? We expect to be told all these things by the hon. the Prime Minister, by the Minister of Justice, by the Minister of Police and by the Minister of the Interior. These are questions requiring an answer.</p>

<p>The Minister of Agriculture is responsible to Parliament for the administration of his department and is responsible to the Prime Minister. Yet he has allowed to develop within his department a situation where gross irregularities and dishonesty have flourished. This is not the only case. Yet he did nothing when he learned about the situation.</p>

<p>He delegates his powers&#x2014;a complete delegation of his powers; he delegates his powers under section 14 of the Expropriation Act completely. He has no safeguard in the special power of attorney. Yet he says, and the hon. the Prime Minister says, that these large amounts should have been referred to the hon. the Minister. How does that arise? In terms of what practice?</p>

<p>At the same time he told us on Friday that while he had delegated his powers to these hon. gentlemen, he had not delegated his duties. He specifically said &#x201C;of course he had not&#x201D;. What are these duties that he has not delegated, that he, on his own admission, has kept? These are to ensure that the powers he delegates are exercised properly and reasonably at all times. He never loses his power as a delagator; he always retains it. His duty is to ensure that the public&#x2019;s money is properly spent and to ensure that he keeps in touch with his department and his department with him.</p>

<p>Now, what has he done in regard to any of these things? The evidence suggests that he has done nothing. He heard about this matter on the 6th March and was alarmed. He tried to stop payment of the cheque on the 6th March. Yet the meeting which took place seemed to be almost a casual one. Is this the manner in which the advice of the Land Tenure Board is given to the hon. the Minister? It failed miserably in its duty; it did not do its duty at all in this regard; it ignored the hon. the Minister completely.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to stop payment of the cheque but it was a day too late. It was on that very same day when he heard about this that he was so alarmed&#x2014;obviously there was something fishy in his opinion&#x2014;that he wanted to stop payment of the cheque on the very day it was handed to Agliotti. What did the hon. the Minister do? Did he pick up the telephone and ask for the Governor of the Reserve Bank in order to stop the cheque in case there was still time? As a matter of fact, did he do anything at all? I think the answer to that must be &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Was he informed? If so, what was he informed? Was he informed that the cheque was issued on the day before or was he informed that the cheque was handed to Agliotti the day before? In fact, the finding of the commission was that it was handed to him on that same day.</p>

<p>What we would also like to know is what happened to the cheque and where in fact that cheque was banked and when it was deposited by Agliotti and where. Also, when was it in fact paid by the Reserve Bank? Those are important questions to which we would like answers. The hon. the Minister owes us an explanation.</p>

<p>The attitude of the officials of this department is significant in this case. Even in respect of the biggest single transaction in the history of the department&#x2014;R7&#x00BD; million for a comparatively small piece of <span class="col_8941-8942" refersTo="page_1604"/>land of 300 morgen&#x2014; they did not even feel that it was necessary to refer to the hon. the Minister. This shows a lack of control and a lack of supervision by the hon. the Minister. It shows how out of touch he must be with the administration of his department and it shows what little confidence the officials of his department have in him as a Minister.</p>

<p>Why did the hon. the Minister not do something on the 6th. when he knew and was alarmed about the transaction? He presumably told the Cabinet about it on the 9th March. The first time we heard about that was when we heard from this hon. Minister. According to the hon. the Prime Minister action was taken not as a result of the alarm of this hon. Minister or what he told the Cabinet meeting cm the 9th March, but as a result of what Mr. Sias Reyneke said at the candidates&#x2019; meeting on 14th March and as a result of the street gossip in Boksburg or wherever it was.</p>

<p>This is not good enough. Let me say that there is a precedent which is on all fours with what I believe the hon. the Minister should do. Let me say that the hon. the Minister should resign. He is responsible to this House and this country for the administration of his department. After such a shocking report, he ought to resign in the interests of the administration of this country.</p>

<p>Let me name a very good precedent: In 1954 the Minister of Agriculture in Great Britain, because of rumours of scandalous treatment by way of expropriation of someone&#x2019;s property, ordered a public enquiry into the workings of that department. I refer to the Crichel Down case. Sir Thomas Dugdale was the Minister of Agriculture. The commission reported that there had been maladministration, but that there were no <i>mala fides</i> on anyone&#x2019;s part. No blame whatsoever was attached to the Minister in that case. Nevertheless the Minister conceived it his duty to resign, because he was responsible for the administration of his department to Parliament. In this case it is very much more so. The hon. the Minister is not only responsible, but he has demonstrated how out of touch he is with his department.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister says he has confidence in his Cabinet. Here we have one peep into one window of one department. What can be going on elsewhere! What else can be going on where powers are delegated and we have a myriad Statutes which give the Ministers power to delegate their functions? With all the boards we have which are appointed by the other Ministers, what else can be happening? If the hon. the Prime Minister wants the country to have confidence in his Cabinet, the only way in which he can do that is to call in this case for the resignation forthwith of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the start I want to rectify one important matter, and that is with regard to the Opposition&#x2019;s charge that steps had not been taken to investigate this matter prior to the publication of the report in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> As in many other departments, powers are delegated in the Department of Agricultural Credit, In my departments I have delegated very many powers to officials. When it comes to veterinary surgeons who have to take certain steps in connection with the control of diseases, and in many other cases, it is essential that there should be delegated powers. In this case it is not a new practice, because powers have been delegated throughout the years. In this case the powers have been delegated to two senior officials of the department. In all cases of delegated powers, it is always the practice that in a case such as this, where the matter is not completely clear and beyond doubt, and if there is any doubt whatsoever. the matter should be referred to the Minister. In this way hundreds of matters are referred to me. I can mention examples of this. More or less at the same time negotiations were also being conducted in regard to the purchase of land for the diplomatic suburb in Pretoria. Every step of these negotiations were referred to me by the Secretary and the Deputy Secretary of the Department. In this case this was not done. The reason why this was not done, is very difficult to determine. For that reason a commission of enquiry was appointed.</p>

<p>But now I just want to give this House the particulars of this matter. On Friday, 6th March, the hon. the Deputy Minister and I held discussions with Dr. Henning, the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Board. I cannot remember the exact time but, in any event, it was after 3 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon. In the course of those discussions we in fact discussed the question of land valuations and how it should be <span class="col_8943-8944" refersTo="page_1605"/>done. We had before us valuations which differed by 300 per cent. These valuations were in respect of the purchase of certain agricultural land. During that discussion Dr. Henning told me he was very concerned about the high prices being paid for land and about the methods of valuation which could not be determined exactly. The fact remains that on the occasions when we have had to deal with these matters, and when we have gone to court with matters concerning valuations, the department has lost the cases virtually without exception. Virtually without exception, larger amounts of money were awarded to the plaintiff than those the department was prepared to pay. In regard to the case under discussion, I want to say that Dr. Henning told me that Friday afternoon, that he was concerned about the high prices, for example, the case which had been before the board on the Wednesday. i.e. the case of the purchase of land on behalf of the Department of Transport. I then asked him to what case he was referring and he mentioned the case and explained what the case was about. He said that the case which had been before the board, represented an amount of R6.3 million. I immediately said to him that I would not decide about such a matter, hut would take it to the Cabinet. In reply to my question why the amount was so large, he said that according to reports which had been submitted to them, the soil contained certain sand minerals, I immediately instructed the Secretary to report to me. Mr. Schoeman, the Deputy Minister, was present. I told the Secretary that I wanted a full analysis of this matter, because I as Minister would not take a decision myself in respect of a case which involved such a large amount, but would take it to the Cabinet. The Secretary then informed me that the cheque had already been paid out.</p>

<p>Paid or given out?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I was informed that the cheque had already been handed over. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to play with words now. [Interjections.] I was informed that the cheque had already been handed over to the sellers. I then asked him why this had been done, because in practice such cases are always referred to me, especially when such a large amount is involved. I asked him on what authority that cheque had been paid out and who had signed it. He immediately told me that the cheque had been paid out by Mr. Todd. I again asked on whose authority it had been done, to which he replied that it must have been on the authority of Mr. Todd himself. I cannot judge in respect of that. The commission investigated it. I told the Secretary that I wanted the documents to be submitted to me immediately so that I could see on what basis it had been done.</p>

<p>My first question to him was whether the Department of Transport had been notified that such a large amount had been paid for this land. His reply to me was: &#x201C;We have purchased on the instruction of the Department of Transport.&#x201D; I said to him that that was not what I had asked but that I wanted to know whether the Department of Transport had been notified that such a large amount had been paid for the land. I added that one could almost buy an airport for that amount. My second question to him was whether, since they had been dealing with a case involving land containing mineral deposits, the provision of the Agricultural Credit Act that the Department of Mines should be consulted in such a case, had been complied with. His reply was: &#x201C;No, they have a letter from one of the geologists of Planning who said that according to the reports, this was not a high price.&#x201D; In spite of this I issued the instruction that these things should be submitted to me. On Saturday and Sunday the offices were closed, of course, but on Monday this matter was discussed in the Cabinet. I informed the Cabinet that contrary to all practices, customs and ways of the past the amount had been paid out without the Minister having been consulted, I also reported that the Department of Mines had not investigated the matter.</p>

<p>While the Cabinet was still in session, the Prime Minister immediately announced that, if necessary, he would order a commission of inquiry into the matter. I undertook to go further into the matter in the course of the following week and to submit further reports in that regard at the next Cabinet meeting. During that week I investigated the matter and found that things had been done which were usually not done in matters of this nature. The first was that the practice which is usually followed, i.e. that the Minister is informed about such matters, had not been complied with. Secondly, I found that the demand <span class="col_8945-8946" refersTo="page_1606"/>I had put to them, i.e. that this matter should be submitted to the Land Tenure Board for comment had in fact been met and that this Board had recommended an amount of R6 300 000. Subsequently, however, the officials increased the amount by more than R1 000 000 without referring the matter to the Board again. This, of course, gave me the impression that something could be wrong in this case.</p>

<p>But you did not suspend the officials?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I then investigated the matter further. You must remember that here I was concerned with two of my senior officials in the department. In any event, I then found that they had not complied with the Treasury regulation either, an instruction the Treasury had given to every department. Hon. members will find this instruction in the report of the commission as well. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All final applications by departments for the purchase of land or sites, with or without improvements, by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure on their behalf, shall be submitted to the Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, who will transmit such applications with the comments of his department to the Treasury for consideration before any commitment is entered into in respect of such purchases.</block>

<p>Accounting officers are requested to indicate in their initial applications whether the property is to be purchased as an independent transaction or as part of a scheme which envisages the subsequent purchase of further property and to furnish an estimate of the total cost of such scheme, including costs of buildings, equipment, running costs, etc.</p>

<p>The fact that funds have been appropriated for the purchase of land for public and general purposes, should not be construed as authority to proceed with any particular service which has been included in the programme of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure.</p>

<p>I was to report this finding at the next meeting of the Cabinet, that is on the Monday, in consequence of what the hon. the Prime Minister had said at the previous meeting when he made the statement that, if necessary, he would appoint a commission. On Saturday, 14th March, the candidates&#x2019; conference to which the Prime Minister referred, took place. I was not present at that conference. On the Saturday evening, it could have been between 8.30 and 9 p.m., the Prime Minister telephoned me and informed me that he had attended the conference and that he felt that instead of an ordinary inquiry, he wanted to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry into the whole matter. I informed the Prime Minister that on the basis of the investigation I had made in the department up to that stage, I agreed with him 100 per cent, because things had taken place where the officials had not followed and carried out the normal practices and instructions.</p>

<p>In other words, the decision to convert an ordinary inquiry into a judicial inquiry, had been taken by the Prime Minister on that Saturday evening already. He consulted me in regard to the matter and asked me what my standpoint was. As I have already said, I agreed with him 100 per cent. So, when the Sunday <i>Times</i> published the report the next day, the Prime Minister had already decided to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry, therefore also before the Monday on which I would have had to report to the Cabinet again in accordance with the decision which had been taken in that regard at the previous meeting of the Cabinet.</p>

<p>In regard to delegated powers, these do, of course, exist. The relationship between a head of a department and his Minister is such, however, that in practice cases of this kind are always referred to the Minister, that on each occasion when a dispute arises, the Minister always takes a decision with regard to the matter from which the dispute arises. Most of these cases are not concluded by means of expropriation. It is first done by means of negotiation. It is only if this does not succeed, that an expropriation order is issued and normally in all cases such an order is first discussed with the Minister in order to obtain his approval. But in this case this was not done, and because of this, I immediately felt that something could be wrong in regard to the whole transaction&#x2014;carelessness, neglect or whatever. As a result of that, I then undertook to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>As I have already said, it became apparent from this investigation, that, according to the practice over the years, such matters were usually referred to the Minister <span class="col_8947-8948" refersTo="page_1607"/>and, in the second place, that in cases where mineral rights were involved, the Department of Mines should be consulted. This, too, was not done in this case. In the third place, I found that the Treasury instruction, to which I have already referred, had not been complied with. It became quite evident from this that here was a case which had been dealt with in an extraordinary way in comparison with other cases. But immediately, as soon as possible after these matters had come to our attention, we decided to order an inquiry. If hon. members want to suggest that I have neglected my duty because nothing like this ever happened in the past &#x2014;surely something like this must happen for the first time, otherwise it will never happen&#x2026; [Interjections.] Such a thing must happen for the first time, otherwise it will never happen. I would have expected hon. members at least to have given credit to the Prime Minister for deciding as soon as possible after the investigation in the department had been conducted, to appoint a judicial commission of inquiry.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in cases like these, where we are dealing with officials, I would have expected hon. members&#x2026; Let me say that when it comes to carelessness of officials, as in a case such as this one cannot determine in advance whether those officials would act differently in a particular case than they would have done under other circumstances. One cannot determine this in advance; one can determine this only afterwards. If, for example, one of my officials acted by proxy and placed a certain district under quarantine at the outbreak of some cattle disease or other, and he made a mistake, it would not be possible for me to determine in advance that he would make a mistake; I could do so only afterwards.</p>

<p>But immediately after there was any suspicion that this matter had not taken its normal course, that the officials responsible had not carried out the instructions and had not complied with the requirements of the Treasury, the hon. the Prime Minister appointed a commission of inquiry, not an ordinary commission of inquiry, hut a judicial commission of inquiry. A Minister, of course, is responsible for the management of his department, but in the same way as he is responsible for this, he is also dependent on his officials who administer the department. If suddenly the normal practices which have been followed throughout the years were not followed in one case, he could not have known in advance that the normal procedure would not be followed. All that can then be expected of him, is that he would have the matter investigated in order to establish why the normal practices had not been followed, why the instructions had not been complied with, and why the provisions of the Act had not been complied with. He cannot have them prosecuted before something like this has taken place.</p>

<p>Sir, hon. members speak about the steps which have been taken in this case. While the commission was conducting its inquiry, when certain things came to light from the evidence, the hon. the Prime Minister immediately instructed the Police to investigate the matter. The recommendations of the commission were that this matter should be referred to the Attorney-General. There are two ways in which one may deal with an official if one thinks he has been negligent, and I want to point out that this commission did not find that there had been dishonesty on the part of anyone. The commission possibly created suspicion that there might have been dishonesty.</p>

<p>What it in fact said, was that there had been gross negligence on the part of certain officials, and that when officials were negligent, action should be taken against them in terms of the procedure laid down by legislation. When an official is charged with negligence, the head of the department must lay a charge against him which must then be investigated. This matter was discussed with the Public Service Commission and, as always in the past, their standpoint was this: When such an inquiry is ordered and a criminal charge is also being investigated by the Police, they wait until that inquiry has been completed before further steps are taken against such an official. This is also the reply which the hon. the Minister of Justice gave hon. members.</p>

<p>Sir, action can also be taken against the head of the department concerned with the matter, but action can only be taken against him by the State President. According to the commission, there is proof of negligence on his part and of his failure to have followed the normal practices, but there is no indication of any criminal offence. Even in this respect I negotiated about the matter with the Public Service Commission, and they felt that the matter <span class="col_8949-8950" refersTo="page_1608"/>should first be investigated by the Attorney-General before action was taken.</p>

<p>Three officials are concerned in this matter. In the first place, there is the chairman of the Land Tenure Board, and in this respect I want to say that the chairman of the Land Tenure Board had no delegated powers. In this case he acted in an advisory capacity only. The Act provides that transactions involving agricultural land, as well as other transactions, may be referred to the Land Tenure Board. The chairman of the Land Tenure Board acted merely in an advisory capacity on the basis of the evidence available to him, but, in any event, he is not implicated in the payment of the money before negotiations have taken place with the Minister in regard to the matter. The other two officials have been removed from the posts they previously occupied, and have been transferred to other sections of the department, pending the inquiry by the Attorney- General in order to determine whether there is any reason to institute criminal proceedings against them.</p>

<p>This, Sir, in brief, is the history of the whole matter. I just want to put it very clearly once again that the inquiry had been ordered by the hon. the Prime Minister before a word had appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about this matter. The decision to institute an inquiry had been taken at that time. Hon. members need not accept my word or that of the hon. the Prime Minister that he telephoned me on the Saturday evening; there is sufficient evidence that the Prime Minister said at the conference already that he was going to appoint a commission and there is sufficient evidence that he said at a Cabinet meeting on the previous Monday that we would have to investigate this matter if It appeared that things had taken place which should not have taken place. I do not think it was possible to act more quickly than was done in this case, because within a week after the cheque had been paid out or forwarded, within a week after the matter had been brought to my attention and to that of the Prime Minister, that commission was appointed, but the <i>Sunday Times</i> is reserving to itself the right to claim that it saved the State R5 million. The whole Opposition, as it is sitting over there, is guided by the <i>Sunday Times</i>, as it always has been guided by the Sunday <i>Times</i> in the past. In the same way as the <i>Sunday Times</i> has always told the Opposition what to say, it is still telling the Opposition what to say in this case as well. I am convinced that hon. members opposite are going to rise in a moment and say that the report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> led to the appointment of this commission.</p>

<p>I have been a Minister for 13 years, and I am not ashamed of anyone for my record as Minister of Agriculture over those 13 years. What happened in this case, can happen in any administration. The question one should ask oneself if something like this happens, is whether action was taken quickly enough, and if hon. members accuse me of not having taken action quickly enough, they may perhaps have a case. But I maintain that something like this can always happen when powers are delegated to people, when they are put in a position of trust, when they have always carried out their duties in a certain way and then suddenly deviate from the normal practice. Something like this may then happen for the first time, and if it does not happen a first time, it never happens. This is what happened in this case, in spite of the normal practice in terms of which these matters are always referred to the Minister, in spite of the restrictions imposed by the regulations in spite of the provisions of the Act and in spite of the Treasury instructions, which had not been complied with. In spite of the fact that the United Party is making a big fuss about this matter now, it should at least be grateful to the hon. the Prime Minister for having acted so quickly in this matter.</p>

There is one prime issue which was put pertinently to him by the hon. member for Durban North which the hon. gentleman has not answered, and we demand an answer on this issue. If I can have the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention for a moment, the question is this: When and where was the cheque for R7 million banked and paid out?</p>

<p>The Minister is on the defensive already, which makes it more imperative that before this debate is ended, we should have an answer to that question. When and where was that cheque paid out, and what steps did the hon. the Minister himself take in an attempt to stop payment of that cheque? I know that it was already handed over; we all know that. We know it was handed over on the 6th. But what we want to know is what steps the hon. the Minister himself took in an attempt to secure the stopping of that cheque.</p>

<p>Can you imagine. Sir, if this money had been the personal property of the hon. the Minister, that he would merely have sat back and shrugged his shoulders and said in effect: &#x201C;Well, it is too late; the money is gone.&#x201D; Or would he have taken immediate steps to get into touch with his bank to see that that cheque was stopped? This is public money, which is even more important than the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own funds, and we must have an answer to these questions before this debate is concluded. Because of the almost inconsequential attitude of the hon. the Minister, I should like to deal, a little more closely than the hon. member for Durban North was able to, with some of the aspects of this case, basing my criticism on the officials involved.</p>

<p>We have, first of all, the man at the top of the tree, the Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, Mr. Viljoen, the accounting officer for the department, a man exercising the delegated powers of the hon. the Minister, about which I shall have more to say later on, a man whom the hon. the Minister promoted over the heads of others when he appointed this man to this post. The report of the Public Service Commission in this regard is instructive. It says&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the retirement of Mr. F. H. Sevenster, Secretary for Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, with effect from 1st May, 1969, the hon. the Minister of Agriculture approached the Public Service Commission for a recommendation for the promotion of Mr. H. J. Viljoen, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, to the post concerned.</block>

<p>The Commission recommended the person who was in line by way of seniority and by way of merit for the post, Mr. Steyn, but that recommendation by the Public Service Commission was overruled by the Government and the person hand-picked Mr. Viljoen, who was hand-picked by this Minister and by the Government, was placed in the position of head of that department against the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. That is the first point.</p>

<p>This person is a person for whom the Minister must take full responsibility, and what did this person do? First of all, he gave evidence so badly that he was disbelieved by the Commission and branded as an unreliable witness. Secondly, as accounting officer, he failed to obey the most elementary instructions and to refer the <span class="col_8953-8954" refersTo="page_1610"/>case to the Department of Mines for an accurate assessment of the value of the clay; thirdly, he conspired with two other officials, Venter and Todd, to pass this transaction off as an expropriation so as to avoid a reference to the Treasury in terms of the instructions which the hon. the Minister has told us about; and, fourthly, he arbitrarily altered the decision of the Land Tenure Board, and in a matter of moments and for no apparent reason added over R1 million to the price which that board had fixed. All this when the officials involved, the three I have mentioned, did not even fully know the facts of the case. Now this man is, as I have said, the head of the department and the most senior official of the department, a man who presumably, if the job is being done properly on both sides, is in daily contact with the hon. the Minister, a man hand-picked, as I have said, for this job, a man guilty of conduct which suggests either neglect of duty on a quite incredible scale or a man who has been party to a gigantic fraud, through which Agliotti stood to gain some R5 million from the State. There is the first individual we are concerned with in a matter which the hon. the Minister has tried to brush off with the speech he has just made. He has, indeed, in a manner of speaking, shrugged it off, as I am reminded.</p>

<p>Let us come to the next senior official of the Minister&#x2019;s department, Mr. Todd, the Deputy Secretary. Much the same could be said about that gentleman, as I have already said about Mr. Viljoen, save that he was not hand-picked for the job; he appears to have got there through normal promotion. But he has one saving grace, and that is that when giving evidence he was found by the Commission to be an honest and reliable witness. This man stood second in charge of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department, and presumably he had contact with the Minister at frequent times.</p>

<p>Then there is Mr. Venter, another senior official near the top of this department. Now I am not going to say a great deal about Mr. Venter. Suffice it to say that his conduct covers almost four columns of the Commission&#x2019;s report, almost four columns of irregularities of one kind or another, ending up with the positive charge that he was guilty of <i>mala fides</i> in circumstances from which one can draw only one inference, namely that he sought to derive advantage, if he did not in fact do so, from this attempt to defraud the State.</p>

<p>Then we come to the Land Tenure Board. This is a board consisting of members appointed entirely by the hon. the Minister. One of that board&#x2019;s functions is to advise the Minister on land values when there is land to be purchased by the Government. The Chairman, of the board, a certain Dr. Henning, was found to be an unreliable witness who was not frank with the Commission. The board itself did not make even a pretence of doing its job. Its job was carefully to dissect, discuss and weigh up the facts and the opinions collected by Mr. Venter in regard to this piece of land and the value which should be attributed to it. Its task was further to check the probity and accuracy of that report, to examine the calculations, if necessary to call for independent inquiry and opinions in regard to the matter, and after that to come to a conclusion upon which it could advise the Minister. That was the function of this board, a board which one imagines operates almost daily, and has done for years. What did they do, Sir? It is almost unbelievable. They did not even open the file! Had this not been said in an official commission of inquiry report, one would simply not have believed a statement of that kind but these are the facts. Not only did they do that; they also misinterpreted a memorandum drawn up by the Department of Planning. This is pointed out by the commissioner. They then plead by way of excuse that none of them had any knowledge of the type of valuation they were supposed to be doing. This, Sir, they plead as an excuse: They had knowledge neither of the valuation of the surface nor of the valuation of what lay underneath. Without that qualification or knowledge, and without opening the file, they then made an unqualified recommendation that the property should be bought for R6,3 million! This was an unqualified recommendation made, as I have said, without even opening the file.</p>

<p>They did look at one thing, and that was the submission by Mr. Venter, which he materially altered in their presence, whilst the board was sitting. The commissioner finds that they applied completely the wrong principles in coming to their conclusion, and that they accepted what was put to them by Venter &#x201D; without displaying the most elementary circumspection&#x201D;, As I have said, he had altered his original submission in their presence.</p>

<p>This state of affairs is hardly credible, and it is in these circumstances that one <span class="col_8955-8956" refersTo="page_1611"/>stands up after hearing a speech such as the one the hon. the Minister has just made, in which he has almost shrugged this off as something which could happen to any body. The head of the department, party to what is tantamount to a fraud, the deputy head of the department, likewise situated, a senior administrative officer of the department, the principal functionary in the fraud, and the Land Tenure Board, a body of persons appointed presumably because of their knowledge and experience, one would imagine, in this sphere, by the Minister, come to a decision that R6,3 million of the public&#x2019;s money should be paid out, without even opening a file. Then, too, this decision of the board&#x2019;s was based on wrong calculations and wrong principles.</p>

<p>Who are these people that the Government appoints to serve on a board of this kind? I would have thought that the hon. the Minister in his speech would have at least justified his selection of these gentlemen for appointment to the Land Tenure Board. But not a word was said about them. Have these gentlemen any qualifications of any kind? The record of the report suggests that they have none what ever, not even the qualifications of elementary common sense. I believe we are still entitled to this information: Who are the members of this board and what are their qualifications, or is this simply another case of &#x201C;jobs for pals&#x201D;? How many other cases of this nature have there been, where an official like Venter, acting <i>mala fides</i>, has put forward a cooked-up case which has been accepted by the Land Tenure Board without even opening the file concerned? If it can be done in a case involving over R6 million, what then is the attitude of this board to a mere R100 000? This board also plays a part in the alienation of State land. This board inquired into and recommended the lease which Mr. Bell now enjoys at Umfolozi, but that is not a matter I can discuss this morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have here a state of affairs where the three top officials of a major Government department are to a greater or lesser extent involved either in a gigantic fraud, designed to do the State out of millions, or are incompetent to an extent undreamed of before in the history of this country. These are the only two conclusions to which we can come. Furthermore, Sir, you have an advisory board, the Land Tenure Board, whose incompetence is of such a magnitude that it is hardly credible&#x2014;that is the extent to which matters have gone in the Minister&#x2019;s department. But despite all this, the hon. the Minister comes to Parliament and asks us to accept his story that the Minister and the Prime Minister acted as quickly as they could be expected to, that this is something which could happen in any Government department, that he, i.e. the hon. the Minister, knew nothing about this&#x2014;which I accept immediately&#x2014;until after the event. He heard it almost casually, if I understood him correctly, from the chairman of the Land Tenure Board and, consequently, he says there is no question of his resigning. Let me say at once that the inference to be drawn is that if the hon. the Minister knew nothing about this, if this sort of thing can take place within his department in the circumstances in which we know it took place, then, Sir, the hon. gentleman was as incompetent as his officials were. [Interjection.] The important principle is this, that here you have a whole clutch of top officials, including a statutory board, who felt free under the administration of this Government and this Minister to act in this manner. They felt free to act in a manner which was so incompetent&#x2014;to put it at its best&#x2014;that it is almost unheard of in the Government of any democratic country. That is the principle and that is the charge which this Government has to answer for&#x2014;that they have allowed an atmosphere to develop when senior men&#x2014; not clerks at the desk&#x2014;can feel free to act in this manner and presumably expect to get away with it. Otherwise they would not have done it.</p>

<p>Let us look at this question of the delegated authority. The hon. gentleman was questioned but he has not answered it. He says there was a practice that difficult matters, or one might say expensive matters, should be referred to the Minister. But what we would like to know from the hon. the Minister is what written instructions were given, standing instructions, not by the Treasury, but by the hon. the Minister to the men to whom he delegated a general power of attorney. What written instructions were there that in any amount, say, over R100 000 for example, there should be a direct reference to the Minister for his consideration?</p>

<p>I am sorry, but I could not hear the Minister. No doubt some other speaker may be able to inform us of that. The point is whether there were written instructions limiting the exercise of the general power of attorney which the hon. gentleman gave to his two top officials. Were there written instructions limiting that power? Were there written instructions limiting the exercise of the general power of attorney which the hon. gentleman gave to his two top officials? [Interjections.] You see, Mr. Speaker, we cannot get an answer. Therefore we are entitled to assume that there were no such instructions. Did the hon. gentleman demand periodic reports from his senior officials and from the Land Tenure Board as to their handling of matters of this kind? Again, Sir, we do not get an answer. Were there no instructions given and they would have to be written instructions in a properly conducted department- setting out those cases in which the Minister wishes to be involved personally? As I said, we have still not heard when and where that cheque was presented and paid. What check has the hon. the Minister carried out in the Past to see that such things did not happen?</p>

<p>What of the hon. the Minister of the Interior? Agliotti&#x2019;s passport was withdrawn, according to the statement of the hon. the Minister, some three months ago because &#x2014;so we were told by the hon. the Minister &#x2014;he was involved in this affair. I presume that Agliotti&#x2019;s passport was withdrawn because it was felt that he was in some way criminally involved. Presumably criminal proceedings were expected to be brought against him. Mr. Venter, the main culprit and principal offender in this matter so far as we can judge, was allowed to retain his passport because the hon. the Minister &#x201D; did not know that he was Involved&#x201D;. Those are the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words. As printed in the <i>Cape Times</i>, his words were: &#x201C;It has been done in the case of Agliotti and it would certainly have been done in the case of Venter if we had reason to think that he was also in any way involved in the matter.&#x201D; How could any competent person possibly come to the conclusion that Agliotti was criminally involved, without knowing automatically that Venter was likewise involved?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Agriculture spent the greater part of his speech explaining to the House that it was not the <i>Sunday Times</i> which exposed this matter but let me answer the hon. the Minister. Whether or not it was mentioned in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the evidence before this commission, was concluded in September, which was when the Police were brought into this case, according to the questions which were asked last Friday. That evidence was splashed all over the daily newspapers. Everybody in the world who had any intuition at all, knew that Venter was as much involved as was Agliotti. But Venter goes overseas on a holiday and Agliotti had his passport withdrawn. The hon. the Minister or his predecessor&#x2014;whoever it was&#x2014;did not know that Venter was involved. The Cabinet's decision to refer this matter to the Attorney General because of what was contained in paragraph 238, was taken on the 22nd January which is nearly six months ago. That referred specifically to the <i>mala tides</i> of Agliotti and Venter. Yet we are to believe that the hon. gentleman did not know!</p>

<p>Now we come to the position of the hon. the Prime Minister. He is praised by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for having appointed this commission of inquiry very quickly. I do not believe it was quick at all. It was apparently announced on the evening of the 14th for the first time to a select group of Nationalist Party candidates, or during the day of the 14th. Yet apparently it was known earlier that week, on the 9th, because that is when it was discussed in the Cabinet. The hon. gentleman has appointed a number of commissions of inquiry, and I am thinking of two in particular. It is well known that judicial commissions are normally appointed from the ranks of either judges or <span class="col_8959-8960" refersTo="page_1613"/>magistrates. Judges, from their training and qualifications, take the cases of the Supreme Court which are the more difficult and more involved cases because, as I have said, of their training and background. Magistrates, because of their training and background, take the less difficult and involved cases. In the Kolver inquiry, where the answer to the commission&#x2019;s terms of reference was known before it sat, the hon. gentleman appointed a judge of the Supreme Court. In this inquiry, one of the most difficult and involved inquiries, I imagine, that this country has ever seen, the hon. gentleman appoints a magistrate. I mention this merely to show what appears to be the ineptness of the hon. gentleman in the appointment of his commissions. However, let me say at once that the magistrate involved has done a magnificent job under the most difficult circumstances, in unravelling a very tangled web.</p>

<p>We have had a number of events in recent months. The question arises: Where are we going? We have had the unease which is felt in the country with regard to ministerial shareholdings. We have had the disquiet which arose over the Carel De Wet&#x2014;Marendaz affair. We have had the doubts which have been raised over the fish issues which have not yet been answered. Now we have the Agliotti affair upon which there is even greater disquiet. I believe that what the country wants at the present time is an image from the administration of its affairs, not of smartalec stuff, not of oratorical slickness in this House, hut of solid reliability, of seriousness of purpose, of a grave approach to our problems such as we get so often from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. *</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is a saying which goes: &#x201C;It is easy to be wise after the event&#x201D;. That is precisely what we have here this morning: Full wisdom after the event. But there is nothing wise about the things which are being said here; this is a malicious attempt to make political propaganda out of a matter which, I think, is perhaps best described by the Commissioner when he states, in paragraph 267 of the report of the commission of inquiry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This expropriation was preceded by various irregularities on the part of individuals. These individuals include officers of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure as well as private persons.</block>

<p>We have now had this furore here this morning and where what was at issue was not this R5 million in regard to which the United Party, as they wished to imply, are concerned, but nothing else but political gain, [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I wish you would ask those public mourners to give me a chance to make my speech. It seems to me that they are only here to make a noise and for no other purpose.</p>

<p>When the report on this transaction appeared in the <i>Beeld</i> of 8th March, 1970, under the caption &#x201C;State paid R7&#x00BD; million for 303 morgen of land&#x201D;, I was shocked and disappointed because, owing to my long residence in Boksburg, where that land is situated, I know about these things and the land values there. A week after that report appeared in the newspaper I spoke to several people in Boksburg. People also came to me and expressed their disappointment. Knowing that we would on Saturday, 14th March, have a conference of candidates I undertook to raise the matter there. I consequently did so on Saturday, 14th March, in Pretoria. When I discussed the matter there, I furnished reasons why I was of the opinion that irregularities had taken place. In the first place, that R1&#x00BD; million transaction, which had fallen through a year before was not a disclosure by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I told the Prime Minister that morning that Agliotti had less than a year before received a signed offer on condition that he obtain industrial rights on that land. He did not obtain industrials rights. I also told the Prime Minister that R7&#x00BD; million was completely out of proportion to land values in that area. When the valuation court sat in Boksburg in November of the previous year, I attended that session. That was in fact the day on which that piece of land belonging to Mr. Agliotti was under discussion. As appears from this report, the sworn appraiser, Mr. Kruger, valued that land at R840 000. Mr. Agliotti and his attorney were terribly full of excuses that morning. He alleged that the land was absolutely worthless because he had been unable to obtain industrial rights and because he could not convert it into a residential area and also that it was useless for agricultural purposes owing to the lack of water. The valuation court decided that day to reduce the valuation of that land to R250 000, and Mr. Agliotti appealed aganst it. I told the Prime Minister that in spite of mention being made of clay values, as in the <i>Beeld</i>, that whole area, thousands of <span class="col_8961-8962" refersTo="page_1614"/>morgen, contained the same kind of clay. Therefore it was not the value of the clay which could increase the value of that 303 morgen. I was at the conference when the hon. the Prime Minister said that he would be receiving the necessary documents that very day, that he would have the matter investigated, and that if it appeared that there had been any irregularities, he would appoint a judicial commission to investigate the matter. He said that if it should appear that there had been irregularities he would introduce legislation to invalidate the transaction. That was the undertaking he gave at the conference held on Saturday, 14th March. And let me say that the Prime Minister has kept his word. That same Sunday evening the statement was issued. In a report in <i>Die Transvaler</i> of Monday, 16th March, it was said that if the commission should find that there had been any irregularities in regard to this transaction, either in regard to the price or the value of the property, the transaction would be invalidated, even if this should require legislation, and suitable action would be taken against the persons responsible, if any. That is how <i>Die Transvaler</i> announced the decision, Sunday, 15th March, the <i>Sunday</i> Times published its report. What do we find there? In the first place the report is nothing hut a eulogy to the business acumen of Mr. Agliotti. [Interjections.] hon. members are laughing, but I challenge anyone to read that report and point out where it is stated, anywhere in that report, that there were any irregularities whatsoever. Let us read what is stated here &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Agliotti, a Reef businessman, who sold his 311 morgen Kempton Park property to the Government for R7&#x00BD; million, has pulled off one of the greatest</block>

<p>business coups in the history of South Africa&#x2026;</p>

<p>[Interjections.] Nowhere is any mention made here of clay values or anything of that nature. There is nothing here implying that there may perhaps have been something wrong with the transaction. The second part of the report, virtually two- thirds of the entire report, dealt with the lamentations of Mr. Agliotti over the great loss he had supposedly suffered. <i>Inter alia</i>, it was stated there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Believe me (i.e. Mr. Agliotti) the purchase has been a tremendous disappointment to me and my family. This land is worth far more; its value is almost incalculable as far as the clay is concerned.</block>

<p>That is what the report was concerned with &#x2014;Mr. Agliotti&#x2019;s business acumen and his lamentations over the loss he had supposedly suffered. Actually, the <i>Sunday Times</i> tried to imply through this report that the land, according to Mr. Agliotti, was worth far more than that, than the R7&#x00BD; million. No reasonable person could deduce from the report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> that any irregularities had occurred or that too much had been paid for the land. If hon. members want to imply that the Prime Minister should have concluded from this report that a judicial commission should have been appointed, they are being foolish, for no reasonable person can say that he had been able to deduce that from this report. But it is interesting to note that six months later, on 6th September, after it had been reported that Mr. Agliotti was prepared to pay back R5 million, the <i>Sunday Times</i> appeared with its version of an eulogy by the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that they were supposedly the watchdog of South Africa. <i>Inter alia</i>, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My appreciation and thanks as Leader of the United Party Opposition go to the <i>Sunday Times</i> which in this matter, as in so many others, has acted fearlessly as the watchdog of the interests of&#x2026;</block>

<p>[Interjections.] In that same edition the <i>Sunday Times</i> published the untruth that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had allegedly said that the land had been offered to the State two years before for R1&#x00BD; million. Of course, I do not know how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition came by that, and whether it was that same watchdog which supplied him with the information. If the <i>Sunday Times</i> had allegedly been responsible for the appointment of this commission of inquiry, why did it wait six months before laying claim to having done so? In no other edition of the <i>Sunday Times</i> was any such claim made. Why did they not come forward immediately after the appointment of the commission and say that it had been they who had disclosed these things?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister, on 16th September last year, when the Opposition raised the matter, stated the matter in this House <i>inter alia</i> as follows. He was referring here to that conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_8963-8964" refersTo="page_1615"/>On that occasion the hon. member for Boksburg rose and told me that, in spite of what was being said about the land, and in spite of the valuations which had been placed on that land, there was something fishy about that matter. At that conference of candidates he mentioned specific reasons for saying so. At the conference I told him and all the candidates that I would appoint a commission of inquiry, for these were the rumours that were circulating on the East Rand and in Boksburg. This matter had as little to do with the <i>Sunday Times</i> as with the man in the moon.</block>

<p>Sir, if he will give me his attention, I now want to ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition in all earnestness this morning: Does he accept my word for the events as I have now recounted them to him? He can just answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no,&#x201D; I want to ask him if he accepts the word of the hon. the Prime Minister? I want to ask him whether he accepts the word of all the Transvaal Ministers who were present at that conference, and the word of the almost 150 candidates who were present there? Sir, I do not know whether he first wants to go and consult the <i>Sunday Times</i> to hear whether he should accept our word. Sir, I challenge the <i>Sunday Times</i> to publish this version, just as I have stated it here, just as it was, to give the people outside an opportunity of judging who was responsible for the appointment of this commission of inquiry. But, I can tell you in advance. Sir, that they will not do it because the <i>Sunday Times</i> has never had any respect for the truth. It is very clear that the investigation was not instituted as a result of the so-called disclosures of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, but as a result of information furnished by this side of the House and as a result of representations made by this side of the House to the hon. the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, I think it is fitting that we on this side of the House praise and thank the hon. the Prime Minister this morning for his actions. Once again it proves to us and the people outside his unimpeachibility and his great integrity in having even been prepared, and he still is, to act without fear or favour if there is any irregularity in regard to any transaction. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who is known outside as a gentleman, why he is not big enough, why he is not man enough, to stand up and to express his gratitude to the hon. the Prime Minister. He prefers to turn to the <i>Sunday Times</i>, which he describes as the watchdog of South Africa. Sir, may Heaven preserve South Africa if the <i>Sunday Times</i> has to be the watchdog over the interests of South Africa, I think all of us shudder at the idea that a Joel Mervis, a Stanley Uys, or a George Oliver should be the watchdog over the interests of South Africa. We know them, Sir, to be people who have only one object in mind, and that is the destruction of the National Party and the Whites here in South Africa. The other day I read a short article about Alsatians which one apparently cannot trust. It was stated in the article that as long as an Alsatian was handled well, it would not attack its handler, but that as soon as it lost confidence in its handler, it would turn on him and savage him. All I can say is that that watchdog of theirs, that Alsatian of theirs, the <i>Sunday Times.</i> is already savaging the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, for it is the <i>Sunday Times</i> which said that he is no longer listening to them; it is the <i>Sunday Times</i> who told him about his poor performance here in the no-confidence debate.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, over the years we have got to know this Government for three things: the first is its weak administration; the second is its inability to manage the economy of the country at all confidently, and the third has been its failure to plan adequately for the future happiness and security of the people of South Africa. Sir, when I speak about its weak administration, this Agliotti case is but one example. We have had other examples in the course of this session. We have heard about odd things happening about fish; there is a butter muddle at the moment; there is a muddle over the motor industry at the moment; there has been a muddle over the hire purchase business and this morning we heard of the greatest muddle of the lot, and that is this appalling example of administration by this Minister in respect of the Agliotti affair.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Boksburg, who seems to have spent the whole of his time trying to prove that it was he and not the <i>Sunday Times</i> who should be called the watchdog of the nation, wants to know whether I accept his word as to the truth of what happened at the candidates&#x2019; conference. Yes, Sir, I accept his word but why should we have waited until the candidates&#x2019; <span class="col_8965-8966" refersTo="page_1616"/>conference before any action was taken by the Prime Minister or the Cabinet. Sir, this hon. gentleman is patting himself on the back and wagging his tail because he feels that he was responsible for the watchdog activities on the Saturday which resulted in the appointment of a commission. Sir, if he was so upset by this deal why did he not go and talk to the Minister of Agriculture about it when he saw those articles in <i>Die Beeld</i> the week before?</p>

<p>Was it not his duty as a good member to ring up his Minister and to say: &#x201D; This is not a deal that you should be supporting; this is not a good show; this is an extremely bad show&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I want to deal with another matter in connection with this administration. I want to say to the hon. the Prime Minister straight away that there is one thing that has to be clear, I think, if we are to have decent democratic government in South Africa and that is that we do not criticize or attack officials in this House; that is not part of the tradition of this House. If anything goes wrong within a department, we criticize the Minister and hold that Minister responsible. It is the tradition of democratic government throughout the world that where there has been inefficiency, incompetence, negligence or dishonesty in a department it is the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility. He must not come to this House and hide behind officials and tell us that they cheated him and that they did not do their jobs. His business as a Minister is to see that his officials do their jobs, that they do them properly and efficiently in the interests of South Africa, or he must cease to be a Minister and get out. Sir, what do we find here? Here, we find a department responsible for the expropriation of land, not just one deal, not just this deal of R7-&#x00BD; million, but deals amounting to millions all over South Africa, and here we find a machinery apparently set up by the Minister and his predecessors to see to it that public money is not wasted. The suggestion of the hon. the Minister is that although he delegated his powers, he expected the officials to report to him in certain cases. He did cot say in all cases; he said that he expected them to report to him in certain cases where those delegated powers were being used. Did he give them any instructions as to above what sum they were to come to him with these matters? He has told us that he would have gone to the Cabinet over a deal as big as this. Did he ever say to his officials that if it is above R&#x00BC; million or R&#x00BD; million, or R1 million or R5 million, they have to report to him because he wants to take such cases to the Cabinet? No, we have no idea what the hon. gentleman told his officials. He says they usually reported to him, and yet we have a most remarkable state of affairs. The officials do not report to the Minister. They do not observe the regulations laid down by the Treasury that they should obtain Treasury approval. There is a long letter published in <i>Die Transvaler</i> only a few days ago by Dr. Holloway, a former Secretary for Finance, in which me makes it perfectly clear that this is not just a formality. He deals with a case of R700 000 and says how effective it was when this was reported to the Treasury, because the Treasury actually saved R100 000 of the taxpayers&#x2019; money. That was a former Secretary for Finance, and he says how proud they were. But here we are dealing in millions and these officials do not observe the regulations and report the matter to the Treasury.</p>

<p>Then you have something else. You have, laid down by taw, that where there is anything to do with minerals, or something under the ground, you have to have consultation with and get the approval of the Minister of Mines. These officials knew that, but it was not done. Then you have your Land Tenure Board meeting considering the biggest deal it had ever had to deal with in its history, but it never opens the file. It has the file available. To me there is one question that we have to put: How could these officials have acted like that if they knew they were being properly supervised by their Minister from day to day?</p>

<p>If they were being properly supervised, they would not have dared to take a risk of that kind, because they would have known that it would be discovered at once. But what happens?

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, purely by chance. That is my next point. If they knew that in regard to any deal that was put through they would have to report to the Minister and tell him all about it, the Minister would have known about it, but how does the Minister find out? He finds it out in a chance conversation, not with the senior official or the deputy senior official of his department, but he finds it out from a chance conversation with the chairman of the Land Tenure Board, Dr. Henning. This hon. Minister tells us he always had confidence in his officials. What is the position? The commission has now found that Dr. Henning was evasive in answering questions. It finds that it did not believe Mr. Vilioen, who was the Secretary of the department. It speaks well of Todd, but cannot explain his actions, and it does not believe Mr. Venter. But these are the people in whom the Minister has been placing his trust for years. How do we know that this sort of thing has not been going on month after month? You see. Sir, this is the fish that did not get away; this is the big one, but what about all the other little ones that may have been getting away month after month, year after year, without this Minister ever knowing what was going on? And what did these people do? Look at the irregularities in this department. Not only do they not take the advice of the Land Tenure Board, but they buy at a higher price, a price pushed up R1,4 million, with an arithmetical error in it, and extraordinarily, they buy it for a price which apparently Venter and Agliotti had talked about a few days before, R7.5 million. The Minister is not told that they had acted contrary to the advice of the board. He does not know what is going on, and when the Secretary of the department is asked: What happened, and who exercised the delegated power on behalf of the Minister? He does not know; he is not sure. The Commissioner says quite frankly that he does not believe it.</p>

<p>Sir, is this the sort of thing that can g0 on in a Government department? How could there be these endless irregularities if that department knew it had a Minister which was breathing down its neck and supervising them from day to day and from week to week in doing its duty? and then, who signed that cheque? It must have been signed by the accounting officer of the department. The Minister must tell me whether I am wrong. It must have been signed by Mr. Viljoen, the accounting officer.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE; Mr. Todd signed it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There you are, Mr. Todd signed it. The Minister discovered, quite by chance, on the day the cheque was handed over to Mr. Agliotti, that it had been handed over and he was very upset about the deal and he says he hopes to be able to stop payment. I ask. Sir, what would you do if you had issued a cheque for R7,5 million and you wanted to stop payment? Would you not immediately have got into touch with the manager of your bank and said: &#x201C;I have issued a cheque and I want to stop payment&#x201D;? Did the hon. gentleman telephone the Governor of the Reserve Bank? Did he find out whether the cheque had been paid out?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Did he inquire on Monday morning? Did he inquire on Saturday? You see, Sir, I have taken the trouble to talk to some bankers and they tell me it is a miracle if that cheque was cleared by the Reserve Bank before Tuesday. I believe that the Minister, either through ignorance or through negligence, failed to take steps which he could have taken to ensure that that cheque was not paid out. What interests me so much is that this matter was discussed by the Cabinet on the Monday, the 9th, and the Minister reported to the Cabinet and told them, I have no doubt, of the irregularities that had taken place. Did nobody in the Cabinet think of trying to stop payment of that cheque? I ask the hon. the Minister: That is a cheque issued by his department. The cheque must come back to them when it is paid. There will be stamped on it at which bank it was deposited, and there will be stamped on it the date on which it was paid out. That is information we on this side of the House want, because we believe that cheque could still have been stopped as late as the Monday. <span class="col_8969-8970" refersTo="page_1618"/>Now, where is the cheque? Here is the Minister of Finance. Here is the hon. the Prime Minister. That cheque must be in the hands of somebody somewhere in some Government department or of the Reserve Bank, and that cheque must show at which Bank it was deposited and when: it was paid out, and where it was paid out. I think this is most important and that is information that we on this side of the House want to have before this debate comes to an end.</p>

<p>Now, what is the attitude of these officials to the Minister? This speaks volumes. Here you have the biggest deal in the history of the department. The Secretary does not mention it to the Minister, nor does the Under-Secretary mention it to the Minister, and the chairman of the Land Tenure Board mentions it purely in passing, complaining about the high prices he has to pay for land. He does not rush over to the Minister and say: We have just had to deal with something costing R6 million; this is a most serious matter, and has it been discussed with you? No, he just talks about the high prices of land and mentions this particular case. Sir, can you imagine that that attitude would exist in a department where the Minister was keeping proper control? You see, Sir, it is no excuse to come along and say that Agliotti was making misrepresentations. It is no excuse to come along and say that Agliotti was telling untruths. These officials are appointed just to ensure that people do not get away with that sort of thing. They are there to see to it that the public are not done down by people who are trying to do them down. What is the position then? Is it that they were not intelligent enough to see what the man was up to, or is it that they did not want to discover what was going on? Sir, one thought has come to me. Surely, that cheque was not signed by just one official? Surely it was signed by two officials? No company has a cheque signed by one official. It is always signed by a director and the secretary. In every big concern two people sign cheques. The hon. the Minister says that Todd signed it. Who signed it with him? Does the Minister know?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I have to disagree with the hon. the Minister. Here is a dear finding of dishonesty in this report. This paragraph speaks of material misrepresentations and dishonesty on the part of two people. Whether that amounts to fraud, which can be a crime, is another matter, but the whole thing reeks of dishonesty from start to finish.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>According to my notes the Minister did, but I accept that. In any event, he reported an irregularity to the Cabinet cm the Monday morning. Why did the Cabinet not act at once? Why did they not say something must be done straight away? What further questions were asked by members of the Cabinet?</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of how Mr. Venter obtained his passport. The question from the Minister of the Interior is one of the most revealing put in this House. Apparently there is no system in this Government, or in the Cabinet, by which information is passed from one department to another. We had the very tragic case of Tsafendas, a case with disastrous results, also at a time when one department was not keeping the other informed. One would have thought that after an experience of that kind the whole administration would have been tightened up. But what do we find? The Minister of the Interior says that Mr. Venter&#x2019;s name was never mentioned in the <i>Sunday Times</i> [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I ask: Is it possible to run the country in that way? [Interjections.] Must it not be obvious to everybody that if there is a charge of fraud, such a charge can only be proved by Mr. Venter giving evidence against Mr. Agliotti or Mr. Agliotti giving evidence against Mr. Venter? How can you take steps against the one and not against the other? Sir, there is negligence of a very high order somewhere. It seems that the liaison between the various portfolios of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Cabinet is so slack that the one does not know what the other is doing, not even in an important matter such as this.</p>

<p>To the hon. the Prime Minister I want to say that this report was in his hands in January, but it only came to this House in June. Presumably that report could have gone for translation when it was completed in December. Have we really reached the stage that it takes four to five months to translate a report of this kind? Mr. Speaker, we see what your officials in this <span class="col_8973-8974" refersTo="page_1620"/>House do; we see the speed with which Hansard is translated. Here we have a most important document. Should we not accept as a rule in future that important documents are tabled at once, no matter the language in which they have been prepared, and that the translation is done afterwards for the purposes of printing and availability to the public? Because, Sir, delays of this kind cannot be tolerated in matters as important as this.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. the Prime Minister once more that he has a big responsibility in this matter. He must decide whether the traditions of democratic government, Cabinet responsibility and Ministerial responsibility are to be observed in our Parliament or not. If he decides not, where do we end? Is a Minister only going to resign when he is prosecuted? Is he only going to resign when it is shown that he personally has been negligent? We cannot inquire into a Minister&#x2019;s doings. The tradition in this House has always been, as has been the tradition of democratic governments throughout the world, that a Minister takes responsibility for his department whether he happened to know about things or not. He should know about it&#x2014;that is what he is there for.</p>

<p>As I have said, this is just one example. We are getting impatient with this Government. We are becoming very uncertain indeed as to whether this is the Government that is able to face up to the threats with which our security and our future here in South Africa may be faced in the 1970&#x2019;s and 1980&#x2019;s. The sort of obvious threats such as terrorism on our borders, the Chinese in Zanizibar arid Zambia and the communist fleet in the Indian Ocean everybody knows about. The trouble is that there are certain insidious, less obvious threats, both internal and external, which have escaped the attention of many South Africans and, if one is to judge by the actions and the intentions of this Government, have escaped the notice of this Government as well,</p>

<p>I believe that the issue involved in these threats is a very serious one for South Africa. I think there is going to be determined within the next ten or twenty years whether South Africa stays part of the Western world, symbolically speaking, or whether it becomes once again an integral part of Africa unconnected very largely with the Western world. I think that depends on three factors: The first of those factors is how fast we develop industrially and economically in relation to the important Western countries, African countries and Asian countries; I think that it depends, secondly, on how rapidly the standards of living of all our people in South Africa rise and, thirdly, on how strong the westernized sections of our community in South Africa can become. If we are going to develop rapidly industrially and economically and can increase the standard of living of all sections of our community, there is not the slightest doubt that we will be in a stronger position to resist the threats with which we may be faced in the years that lie ahead.</p>

<p>I believe that, on that account, these aims should form the basis of our policy and that that basis should be the strengthening of our nation with those objects in view. What is the form with this Government? When we talk about strengthening the westernized community in South Africa, we cannot help thinking back to the 15 lotus years between 1948 and 1963 when, under this Government, virtually no immigrants came from the European countries into South Africa. One cannot help asking oneself how much stronger we could not have been, economically and militarily, if those steps had been taken. The situation today as a result of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s Budget and the steps he is taking, is that South Africa is committed to a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per annum of the national income in real terms. How does that compare with the rest of the world? If we compare ourselves with the rest of the world, we find that, at that growth rate, we are not going to move up fast enough into the top league in the world of militarily and economically strong powers. We find, too, that, if we only develop at that rate, we are not going to be attractive enough to attract immigrants from Western Europe. I think we must concede that, when one has regard to our potential human and natural resources, it is quite ridiculous to limit ourselves to a mere 5&#x00BC; per cent, because it may not be strong enough to enable us even to keep our position among the nations of the world at the present time. The worst of it all is that the way this hon. Minister of Finance has been operating, there is a very real possibility that we will not reach the growth rate of 51 per cent. One of the reasons for this is that investment <span class="col_8975-8976" refersTo="page_1621"/>in industrial development is already 25 per cent below what is necessary to maintain such growth rate.</p>

<p>With reference to this growth rate and how it compares with other countries, let us look at the countries of Western Europe from which we hope to get our immigrants. One finds that virtually every single one of them except the United Kingdom, is growing faster than 5&#x00BD; per cent per annum. The position is that our population and our workers are increasing far faster than theirs. Because our percentage increase is faster than theirs, the result is that our living standards are not increasing at the same rate. We are falling behind. This is the most serious thing that could happen to South Africa in the modern world. I know hon. members opposite will ask me for proof of this. Let us just look at the increase in real wages in European countries in the past six years and compare that with the increase in real wages in manufacture in South Africa over that same period. The increase in Germany was 28,5 per cent. In France it was 23,8. In Holland it was 32.3. In South Africa it was 13,5. In the United Kingdom it was only 4,5. That is probably why the majority of the immigrants we got came from the United Kingdom. But apart from the United Kingdom, the increase in South Africa was roughly less than half of the other countries which I have mentioned. I do not like mentioning Japan in this House. Hon. members are so sensitive about Japan. But the increase in Japan in the same period, was 41,5 per cent. Can you imagine what a difference it would have made if that had been the position in South Africa?</p>

<p>But there are people who will not be satisfied with this comparison. Therefore, let me give them another comparison, a test which combines both economic growth and population growth. That is the annual growth rate of the gross domestic product <i>per capita</i> for the same period. There, again, we are ahead of Great Britain, but we are behind Western Germany, we are behind Holland, we are behind France. Of course, the figure for South Africa is roundabout one-third of the figure for Japan. They do not have the natural resources or the labour reserves which we have.</p>

<p>What we have to face and what we have made no preparations for is what will happen if Britain joins the Common Market in the course of the next year or two and her growth rate equals the growth rate of other Common Market countries while our growth rate stays at 5&#x00BD; per cent or drops below it, as it may very easily do. Then we will be faced with a very serious position indeed in South Africa, because our living standards for Whites in South Africa, not for the whole population, will be below these for Europeans in the Common Market countries. What chance do we then have of getting immigrants? If we do not get immigrants, even immigrants to maintain the percentage of the White population as against the non-White population, it will mean big trouble for South Africa. Just to make things more difficult, this hon. Minister has now introduced provisions whereby the marginal rates of income tax in South Africa will be greater than in almost any European country as well.</p>

<p>I know of course, what the answers will be from the Jeremiahs on that side of the House. They will tell me that South Africa cannot grow faster than at a rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent, because if it does, it will lead to inflation, to a greater shortage of skilled workers, to lack of capital and to balance of payments difficulties. We have had all those arguments in this House before. There will not be inflation if there is greater productivity. There will not be a lack of skilled workers if there are proper training schemes in education. There will not be a lack of capital, because if we develop fast, the entrepreneurs of the world will be sending their money to South Africa. As for the balance of payments difficulties, the countries with the fastest growth rates have had the smallest balance of payments troubles over the last decade or so. Of course, the Jeremiahs could be right under their policy. However, that is only because they have their priorities all wrong when it comes to trying to increase productivity and trying to get a rapid state of economic growth. The economists of the world have been doing studies as to what the effect of education is on increased productivity and rapid economic growth. They have made some very interesting calculations. And do you know what they decided the position was? They decided that where you have increased productivity and higher living standards, 20 per cent is due to capital investment per worker; 20 per cent is due to better educated labour; and 60 per cent is due to changes in technology and better management techniques, both <span class="col_8977-8978" refersTo="page_1622"/>of which are the result of better education. The result is that for increased economic growth and greater productivity education is responsible for 80 per cent and capital investment per worker for only 20 per cent. For a rapid increase in economic growth a nation must invest in education. How do we compare with the other nations of the world when it comes to the investment in education? I have two sets of figures, one from the Franzsen Commission and one from an article written by Prof. Horwood. an honourable Senator in the Other Place. I give the House the choice to take whichever it likes.</p>

<p>According to the Franzsen Commission South Africa spends 4,2 per cent of its national income on education as against 7,9 per cent by the United States of America, 5,4 per cent by Japan, 7,1 per cent by Russia and 6,3 per cent by Finland. According to Prof. Horwood, South Africa only spends 3 per cent as against 4,6 per cent by the United States of America&#x2014;as opposed to 7,9 per cent under the Franzsen Commission&#x2014;5,7 per cent by Japan, 7,1 per cent by Russia and 6,3 per cent by Finland. Then he supplies the percentages in respect of other countries, for example, the United Kingdom, an estimate of 5,7 per cent and Holland, I think, 5,2 per cent. He is also at pains to point out how much better university staffs are paid in many of those countries than in South Africa. Obviously, if we want to keep pace we have to invest more in education in order to realize the full human potential of our people.</p>

<p>Sir, we must invest more in non-European education. Despite the fact that they outnumber us by nearly four to one, I think we spend on non-European education <i>in</i> <i>toto</i> about a third to a quarter of what we spend on all European education. Obviously you cannot get people developing to the full when that is the sort of situation. But not only that. We also restrict them in the exercise of their skills. It is not surprising that we are short of skilled workers in South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>If we are to realize anything like our full economic potential and if we are to safeguard our future we will have to spend far more on education generally and far more on non-White education in particular, We will also have to make better use of the skills and the semi-skills of the non-White population. Only in that way can we get a growth rate of over 5&#x00BD; per cent which will enable us to increase our living standards at anything like the same rate as they are growing in the Common Market countries in Europe at the present time. We require a growth rate of that kind if we are to bind ourselves firmly to Western society and its legal and moral norms in the Western world.</p>

<p>This is not enough; we have to go further. We have to strengthen the Westernized sections of our people in South Africa so that they firmly accept the free enterprise system and the Western way of life. I believe that certain steps must be taken which are absolutely vital in this regard. The first of those is that immigration from Europe must be encouraged and must be undertaken on a much larger scale than at the present time. If our growth rate falls below 5&#x00BD; per cent while that of the Common Market countries stays above, we will not succeed in attracting immigrants to South Africa. The second thing that we have to do is to stop antagonizing and excluding from our national life the Westernized Coloured community. They must be given the opportunity to share more fully in the fruits of the Western world&#x2019;s life in South Africa and the private enterprise system. In the course of this Session a little progress has been made in that the Government haltingly accepted certain minor facets of United Party policy. The whole blue print for the Coloured people is still something which is completely impossible and must lead to irritation and friction between the two sections of the population instead of drawing that section of the population to us as firm defenders of the Western way of life in South Africa.</p>

<p>In addition there is a third thing that has to be done. Steps must be taken to ensure that the South African Indian community is brought into a closer relationship with those accepting the Western way of life in South Africa. They must be given a greater opportunity to share in the fruits and to be prepared to defend it with us in times of danger. It is difficult to know exactly what Government policy is in respect of the Indian people. One hears that they must retain their own identity. Does that mean that they must keep closer contact with the emergent countries of Asia and with the troubled Far East? I would have thought that the only hope as far as they were concerned lay in the development amongst them of a <span class="col_8979-8980" refersTo="page_1623"/>common loyalty to South Africa and a common commitment to a Western way of life in South Africa at the present time.</p>

<p>There is a fourth thing we must do. We have to take another look at the urban Bantu who are permanently resident in the big urban Bantu townships in and around our industrial centres. You will know, Mr. Speaker, that we have tried on various occasions during this Session to bring the Government to debate on this issue. You know how unsuccessful we have been. I am afraid we are in a position that the Government is following a policy in that regard which is leading to insecurity, lack of home ownership, lack of executive and administrative responsibility, lack of adequate training for their work, seldom adequate schooling for their children and no security at the end of their working life with the prospect of returning to reserves which they never see. Is that the way to keep those people on our side in the event of trouble? Is that something to offer them for which they will fight in future in maintaining the Western way of life in South Africa?</p>

<p>When you see what this Government is doing you get the impression that they are deliberately trying to weaken the bastions on which the Western way of life is founded in South Africa. I do not know whether it is through ignorance. I do not know whether it is as a result of the lack of foresight and a misunderstanding of the foundations on which that society is based. But it seems to me that they go out of their way, wittingly or unwittingly, to alienate almost every ally of Western society here in South Africa, They do it for a policy which many thinking Nationalists admit today has no relevance at all to the Coloured people, the Indian community and the permanent urbanized Bantu. This will not do. If we are to remain part of the Western community and not sink back into Africa, there are certain immediate steps that we have to take. We have to improve the educational facilities and standards of all races and we have to use the resultant skills fully. As a result of this, and together with other sensible economic measures and more efficient State administration, we must stimulate a rapid economic growth above the 5&#x00BD; per cent in the foreseeable future so that we can Westernize the emergent communities in South Africa, the Coloureds, the Indians and the permanently urbanized Bantu. Amongst them all, Sir, we must induce a common loyalty to South Africa, a loyalty based on the fact that they have an important stake in Western society because their happiness, their welfare and the dignity of their lives depend upon it. Sir, the question is whether we can achieve these aims under the present Government,</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that that is impossible because the problem is that this Government has become an anachronism; its ideological obsessions have created an economic situation where the ultimate and basic need of the human being, the need for security, is not being satisfied to the extent that it should in South Africa. You know, Sir, people seek security of employment. This Government has a policy of deliberately separating employer and worker when there is a growing need for the two of them to be brought together. People seek security by way of shelter, by way of homes for themselves and their families, but as a result of the policies of this Government and as a result of its extraordinary labour policy, very few young couples today can afford to buy a home for themselves. Sir, people want to feel that their country is secure, but under this Government we have been vouchsafed very many enemies and very few friends. I believe that our people want to be citizens of a great country.</p>

<p>This Government denies us the opportunity to harness our resources so that we can be equipped for that progress human and material, which only expansion and prosperity can make possible. The trouble, Sir, is that this Government says that it is prepared to see South Africa poor, as long as it is White, but I think the people are beginning to realize that there will never be security in South Africa in the long term, until all the people of South Africa are advancing together towards prosperity. There is no real security, when there are a lot of desperately poor have-nots, prevented in many subtle ways from reaching their full potential, and a relatively small group of fortunate &#x201D; haves&#x201D; whose attitudes are determined by ideologies which are long since out-dated.</p>

<p>Sir, the tragedy of it all is that it is this Government's vast bureaucratic machine which is not only supporting these ideologies, but is hindering the country&#x2019;s progress. <span class="col_8981-8982" refersTo="page_1624"/>It is beginning to dictate to an ever greater degree to everybody in South Africa in every walk of life, every day and every week of every month of the year. Look what is happening. Sir, The Government is becoming not only one of the main competitors against private enterprise and business, but it has taken a stranglehold on decision-making in business today. As far as cultural affairs are concerned, there is a censorship based on archaic values and often incompetently applied, and great public utility corporations like the South African Broadcasting Corporation, are being used to brainwash the public of South Africa, and to stifle enlightened thinking.</p>

<p>What is happening, Sir, in the field of labour? The Government is steadily destroying the initiative of employer and employee organizations to progress by means of collective bargaining. What is happening, Sir, in the field of administration? Jealous as it is for power, this Government is trying to centralize everything in Pretoria. They are undermining the powers of the Provincial Administrations and the great municipalities, civil administration is becoming ever more remote from the people of the country and the amount of participation of the private citizen in decision-making is growing smaller and smaller and, with it, the sense of responsibility is growing smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir, in this vast, cumbersome machine there are many intelligent and efficient people, but unfortunately they get lost in this machine because it is so big and so widespread. The result is that this machine is becoming known for ineptitude and inefficiency in many of its departments, I say &#x201C;ineptitude and inefficiency&#x201D;. Sir, we have had further evidence here this morning of how financial control appears to be slackening in certain areas. Vitally necessary services like telephones, roads, housing and transport are all falling behind the needs of the people. Bad planning is rife and people have to pay for it. Traffic congestion is throttling our cities and the Government is not helping enough.</p>

<p>So, Mr. Speaker, I could go on. This Government&#x2019;s shortcomings are endless. I believe that if we want happiness for the individual, for every individual, a happiness inalienably associated with the Western way of life, which is so necessary in South Africa, which is so necessary for strength, then there must be very big changes. I do not propose to deal with all those changes.</p>

<p>I propose to deal with just a few which affect particularly the urban dweller in South Africa. I believe one of the main targets must be to limit and reduce this vast bureaucratic machine which is threatening to convert the majority of Whites in South Africa into civil servants in the very near future.</p>

<p>The problem is how to do it. We can only do it by restoring the freedom of the private enterprise system, by letting people do things for themselves to a large extent by making political and business decisions in their own towns, for their own people and for their own businesses, and by making the happiness of the individual much more an objective of government. Then I believe we have to have a more flexible system, with more efficient State services designed to help private enterprise and not to stifle it, to encourage and to suggest rather than to control and frustrate. Look at the blunders we have had in this Agliotti affair. That sort of thing cannot be tolerated. I believe we were right to propose a code to the hon. the Prime Minister which should be applied to Cabinet Ministers.</p>

<p>I believe that while we concentrate on education, we should give parents a choice of the type of school they want. They could have single medium Afrikaans schools, or single medium English schools, or parallel medium schools, as they choose. But one thing we have to insist on, and that is a very high degree of bilingualism and efficiency in both languages. Then I believe the traffic and the nagging parking problems in our cities and on our overburdened highways are not only leading to a lack of productivities, but they are affecting the people&#x2019;s health They have become national problems. I believe it is necessary for the Central Government to accept the responsibility, both in respect of planning and in respect of a financial commitment, to deal with those problems.</p>

<p>I believe traffic congestion today has become a national problem which has got to be tackled on a national level. We must go further. We must carry forward those social welfare measures which this party has proposed from time to time. We must review the place of our womenfolk in South Africa who are playing such a big part in the progress of the country. Remember, Sir, only 35 per cent of our White population are economically active; in the United Kingdom it is 51 per cent. If we <span class="col_8983-8984" refersTo="page_1625"/>are to get more help from our womenfolk, we will have to revise the taxation system in respect of married couples. We will have to accept equal pay for equal work for our womenfolk far more generally, and we will have to see to it that they are given an honoured position in the industrial growth and the administrative structure of our country.</p>

<p>I have spoken about the urban Bantu. I do not propose to take that any further, except to say that it is no good talking about Bantustans and pie in the sky in the future. What these people want now is more housing, more efficient services, adequate police protection and wages and salaries which enable them to buy the food, the clothing and the shelter that they require at prices they can afford.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we are to have economic security in South Africa, we must use the talents of all our people. That means respecting and acknowledging the achievements of established business, and helping and not hindering. It means encouragement to emergent communities to progress up the ladder of civilization to strengthen the Western community. It means the destruction of poverty and the establishment of decent living standards for all. It means that by 1990 we could be among the 10 or 12 wealthiest nations in the world.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is simply a question not of whether this country is rich enough, but of whether the White man has the richness of spirit, the generosity, the faith and the vision to embark upon a dynamic policy to strengthen the Western way of life in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as a member of this House I grant the hon. Opposition the right to call any Minister sitting on this side of the House to answer for his actions, but it is important to lay down a criterion for when a person must do this. The criterion laid down this morning by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is that a Minister is responsible for his entire Department, for the negligence and dishonesty of his officials and for the operation of every possible aspect and facet of that Department. It is my opinion that that criterion which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated to this House is a criterion which is too exacting. It is my opinion that the criterion which should be applied, is that a Minister may solely be held responsible if he does not do everything in his power to cause his Department to function smoothly and efficiently. That is all a reasonable person can expect from him.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>On this test he has not failed miserably. As I said, I grant hon. members on the opposite side the right to criticize any Minister, but, then, an Opposition party in a Parliament, also has a certain responsibility. If one wants to debate this matter one should not only consider the different responsibilities of a Minister, but also see what the responsibility of a responsible opposition is, I want to make the allegation that the Opposition which we have in South Africa is one which allows itself to be stampeded by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The headline in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> was &#x201C;U.P. to urge Uys&#x2019;s dismissal over the land deal scandal&#x201D;. Yesterday the United Party was taken in tow, lock, stock and barrel, by the <i>Sunday Times.</i> In fact they were taken in tow by the <i>Sunday Times</i> right from the outset of this Agliotti affair. They were taken in tow right from the outset and they issued statements to the Press in an entirely unbalanced way, made allegations which could not be fully substantiated, and have repeated them now in this House. If the Opposition wants to exercise its rights, we as members in this House are entitled to demand from them that they exercise those rights in a responsible way. In my opinion we find, with this Agliotti affair, that the hon. Opposition did not do that. The most important reason for my saying this was my complete amazement at the hon. the Leader of the Opposition blaming the hon. the Prime Minister for the role he played in this affair. If seen quite objectively&#x2014;even if I had been sitting on the opposite side of the House&#x2014;I do not think any responsible Opposition leader could in all honesty blame the Prime Minister for his actions in this affair. I really think the Leader of the Opposition owes the hon. the Prime Minister an apology. Personally I expected the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, after the attacks made by the hon. member for Durban North and the hon. member for Zululand, <span class="col_8985-8986" refersTo="page_1626"/>to say that whatever criticism they had been able to level, the hon. the Prime Minister was in this specific case beyond all doubt and criticism. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition blamed the Prime Minister for the fact that the Cabinet did not act immediately. However, if he had listened to the speech made by the hon. the Minister, he would have known that at the Cabinet meeting it was decided that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture would institute further investigations into the workings of his Department. At the conference of candidates that Saturday, after the hon. member for Boksburg had informed the hon. the Prime Minister what was going on in Boksburg, the Prime Minister decided there and then that a commission of inquiry should be appointed. That Sunday evening, after the article had appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a commission of inquiry was immediately ordered.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I do not have very much time. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked the Minister why the Minister had not given instructions to the effect that transactions above a certain amount had to be reported to him. On what level, at what stage must one now try to combat dishonesty? Only when it reaches a certain amount or must one try at all times to combat dishonesty? The hon. the Minister explained to the House, and in my humble opinion explained fully his <i>modus operandi</i> there. He explained that he is always in touch with his senior officials to whom he has delegated his powers. In fact, according to the hon. Leader of the Opposition, he supposedly heard of the Agliotti affair in a &#x201C;casual conversation&#x201D;. But surely it was not just a casual conversation. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should read what the Minister said. He said that he and Dr. Henning met, but that in fact shows the degree of co-operation between the Minister and his Department. Whenever they meet one another, the work is discussed. Let us consider the criticism levelled by the hon. member for Durban North. Let us see now whether this terrible attack was well-founded. He criticized the Prime Minister for supposedly having said in this House that the land had been purchased by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. The hon. member has now found out that the expropriation is done by the Minister himself. In this specific case, in the Agliotti case, the expropriation was done after certain submissions had been made to the Land Tenure Board. The hon. the Prime Minister was quite right to give his reply in that connection. Is it really a valid criticism of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s actions to say that he misunderstood the functions of the Board &#x201C;in fact as in law&#x201D;? Is it right that the hon. member should come and stand here and show off as if he was the only person who knows how this expropriation is done? This expropriation was done by the Minister, by the boards and through appraisers. This was followed by a long process of negotiations. Now it is being claimed that it was done quite arbitrarily. Now I want to point out to hon. members the type of criticism we get from the hon. member. The hon. member said that the Prime Minister had supposedly said in reply to a question that Prof. Lombard and the other person involved were professors at the University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Pretoria respectively. I now ask the hon. member, in all honesty, whether that is well-founded criticism? Let us suppose for one minute the hon. member was correct. Surely this is not yet valid criticism of the actions of the Prime Minister. Surely it is childish and ridiculous and should not even have been mentioned in this House. The hon. member then asked here, as pious as he could be, why all of these people were not called to testify before the commission of inquiry. He then furnished examples and said that the Minister had not been called to testify before the commission of inquiry. He went on to say that Mr. Sias Reyneke could also have been called by the commission of inquiry. This criticism he wants to lay at the door of the Prime Minister. Surely it is ridiculous! The hon. the Prime Minister appointed a commission of inquiry with a chairman and two advocates to assist the chairman. There was an advocate representing Agliotti, and surely, between the three of them, they could have obtained all the evidence they regarded as being necessary.</p>

<p><span class="col_8987-8988" refersTo="page_1627"/>Now the hon. member comes here, after he has been lauded by the <i>Sunday Times</i>, and tells the hon. the Prime Minister that he should also have allowed such people to testify. Surely this is absolutely ridiculous criticism. I want to proceed to deal with the statement made by the hon. member for Durban North. I made notes of his speech, and he asked why the hon. the Prime Minister had not ordered a police inquiry. Sir, can the hon. member mention to us a single reason as to why a Police inquiry should have been ordered at that stage? It was decided to appoint a commission of inquiry, and at that stage it was still possible that there was nothing wrong. Why should a Police inquiry have been ordered? The hon. member for Durban North criticized the Prime Minister and said that the Police inquiry had been ordered in September of 1970 while the commission was still proceeding with is inquiry. That is quite correct, but if the hon. members had listened to the speech made by the Minister of Agriculture they would have heard that this had been done after certain irregularities had been disclosed as a result of evidence before the commission. When the irregularities were disclosed, the Prime Minister immediately ordered a Police inquiry. This proved the <i>bona fides</i> and that the action taken by these Ministers had been correct.</p>

<p>It was also asked why Mr. Agliotti&#x2019;s passport was cancelled and not Mr. Venter&#x2019;s. Agliotti was the instigator throughout. He visited various persons involved, and the Department, and if any person presumably acted incorrectly, then it was Agliotti. Agliotti was the person who at frequent intervals pleaded ill-health before the commission of inquiry. He is the person who gave indications that he might possibly go overseas and so get away. That is why his passport was cancelled. After all, we did not know whether he was a citizen of South Africa; he had a foreign-sounding name. His passport was then immediately cancelled. For what reason could Mr. Venter&#x2019;s passport have been cancelled at that stage? For what reason can Mr. Venter&#x2019;s passport be cancelled today? We have no reason to do that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand then came forward with this kind of criticism: &#x201C;Why was Mr. Viljoen appointed instead of Mr. Steyn?&#x201D; </p>

Surely he cannot stand in for the man&#x2019;s good character. Surely he cannot stand in for the man's honesty. Surely he is not there as a guarantor of the officials&#x2019; honesty.</p>

<p>After that he asked what the qualifications of the members of the Land Tenure Board were. This Land Tenure Board, as it is now constituted, has been doing good work for many years.</p>

<p>Yes. The right has always existed to institute court proceedings at any time. The Land Tenure Board is constituted to the best of the Minister&#x2019;s ability. Criticism cannot be levelled in that regard. Hon. members may say that they should not do their work in a certain way, but surely they cannot tell us that those people are completely unqualified to serve on the Land Tenure Board. The hon. member for Zululand then said it was &#x201C;another case of jobs for pals&#x201D;. I think that that is a scandalous remark, and I challenge the hon. member for Zululand to tell us where we are giving jobs for pals on such a large scale. [Interjections] Yes, let us hear. If the United Party wants to discuss the question of jobs for pals with me, then I want to tell them that they should blush all over from shame. [Interjections.] I shall tell the United Party when there were &#x201C;jobs for pals&#x201D;. Under their regime there were no jobs for anyone but their pals.</p>

<p>Listen now to the criticism levelled by the hon. member for Zululand. He said that there had been other commissions of inquiry as well, and that the Prime Minister had on each occasion appointed a judge, but that in this case he appointed a magistrate. What was the hon. member insinuating with that? Was the hon. member insinuating that the appointment of the Chief Magistrate at Bloemfontein was an appointment which could benefit Agliotti? I should like the hon. member for Zululand to listen for a moment. Is that the allegation the hon. member wanted to make7 Why did he put such a question? He put the question: Why did the Prime Minister always appoint a judge to take charge of his commissions <span class="col_8989-8990" refersTo="page_1628"/>of inquiries, but in this case a magistrate? And now I want to know from the hon. member for Zululand whether he is alleging that the magistrate at Bloemfontein did not do a thorough job of work?</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with respect, I would say it was a matter of opinion whether that hon. member knows the rules. In my opinion I do not know whether he does know the rules. If we were to sum up the position, what did we have? The hon. the Minister of Agriculture delegated his powers. It is absolutely impossible for him to guarantee the integrity and honesty of every official. The negotiations in regard to the Agliotti affair extended over a period of months. There were independent appraisers, and a report from the Department of Land Tenure was submitted. We are dealing here with two senior officials who have delegated powers and who have always done good work. They had to make a joint decision and eventually submitted a report to the Minister. The hon. the Minister immediately said that the amount was too high and that the case should be considered by the Cabinet. The hon. the Minister then wanted to stop the cheque. The criticism of the United Party was that the payment of the cheque was not stopped in time. With this fact at any person&#x2019;s disposal, on which grounds could the cheque really have been stopped? A proper purchase had been made. The Department of Land Tenure had ratified it. There had been appraisers and on what grounds could any person have stopped that cheque? After all, there was to be a commission of inquiry. The hon. the Minister knew that it would be possible to get that money back if we had to do so. And what does the Opposition say about that R5 million which was in fact repaid?</p>

There would not even have been a commission of inquiry. Quite probably an additional R1 million would have been paid out.

The actions of the hon. Opposition were irresponsible. There is no reason why the hon. the Minister should resign. I also find it disgraceful that it can be alleged that the hon. the Prime Minister could have done anything more than he did.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Prinshof is a distinguished advocate. He has not done himself justice today. One of the most extraordinary things that he said has been to reject the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s test of the responsibility of a Minister. He says that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility is simply to see that the wheels of a department run smoothly. If that is the case, then many of the Ministers should not be in the <span class="col_8991-8992" refersTo="page_1629"/>Cabinet at the present time. Secondly this advocate from Prinshof says that the hon. the Prime Minister discharged those duties that he should have performed by going to a Nationalist Party conference and telling them that he proposed to appoint a judicial commission. This is not the first time we have heard that the responsibility of our Cabinet Ministers and of the Prime Minister is in the first instance to the Nationalist Party and secondly to the national interest.</p>

<p>*I am not apologizing at all this afternoon for again proposing to speak about the fishing industry and the damage that has been done to it. I would appreciate it very much if the hon. the Prime Minister would remain here in order to listen to what I have to say. I would appreciate it very much. The tremendous damage which has been done to the fishing industry with open eyes in a decade, is in certain respects much worse than the Agliotti case. The damage is of longer duration and both South Africa and South-West Africa will still have to pay a considerable price for it, because the fishing industry is of the greatest importance to both territories, In South-West Africa it is the second most important source of income, without which the proposals of the Odendaal Report simply cannot be implemented. Walvis Bay, Luderitz, Port Nolloth and all the West Coast towns are totally dependent on the fishing industry. My charges thus far during this session in this House have been that the Government and especially the hon. the Minister of Finance and the previous Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Jan Haak, are to be held responsible for the unbridled onslaught on our marine resources, which has had the most detrimental consequences for die entire country. My charge against the Government is that, in spite of warnings that over-fishing was taking place, they have with open eyes allowed this important economic asset to be exposed to the risk of complete destruction.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister is a very courteous man. Generally speaking, he has treated me very courteously in this House. He was appointed in May last year only. I know he is very concerned about the matter, because he has admitted that a mistake was made somewhere. He said: &#x201C;I am deeply concerned about the fishing industry. No one can be more worried than I am.&#x201D; After I had made my speeches in this House, the &#x201C;offensive&#x201D; &#x2014;to use the word of <i>Die Burger</i>&#x2014;came from hon. members opposite. First we had the chairman of Paternoster, the hon. member for Piketberg. He attacked me sharply and said: &#x201C;I am deeply concerned about the to gossip in a reprehensible way in this House. He, the chairman of Paternoster, said emphatically that he already had a rock lobster concession when Paternoster took over. Mr. Speaker, I do not dispute that. I did not dispute it anywhere in my speeches. I am only sorry that this same member did not tell the full story in regard to the take-over of Paternoster, because it is a very interesting one. What I in fact said was that in 1965, after the Nationalist Party members of the House of Assembly had become directors of Paternoster, Paternoster, Orange River Fisheries and South Orange received fishmeal licences. They received them in spite of clear signs of overfishing. I said that at that time, in 1965, Nationalist Party members of the House of Assembly were directors of the company. Furthermore, I said that even today Paternoster does not have a factory. In other words, it has nothing but a paper concession.</p>

<p>The next Paternoster director was Piet Verlig. i.e. the hon. member for Moorreesburg. He said I was trying to break down the image of the fishing industry by gossiping against it. Let him take a look at the 1971 report of Fishcor and read about the state of affairs in the fishing industry of South Africa and South-West Africa today. The last report on the rock lobster reads: &#x201C;The unhappy picture was little relieved in the past 12 months.&#x201D; Concerning pilchards: &#x201C;The downward trend in pilchard landings persisted as did the upward movement of anchovies.&#x201D; </p>

<p>After that, the hon. member for Bellville came forward with the knockout blow or <i>coup de grace.</i> He was the one who had to deliver me the fatal blow. He said my motive was to get in a few digs and to spread some gossip about fish. But, after an exceptionally long introduction to his speech, in which he stated that he was going to expose my misrepresentations, he came to the first &#x201C;misrepresentation&#x201D;. The first &#x201C;misrepresentation&#x201D; was that I had referred to Mr. A. J. Marais as being Jan Haak&#x2019;s attorney partner. I was wrong, of course. I should rather have referred to him as Jan Haak&#x2019;s former attorney partner. But then die hon. member came to the &#x201C;great untruth&#x201D; which I had uttered, namely that I had accused Jan Haak of alleged over-exploitation of the fishing resources of <span class="col_8993-8994" refersTo="page_1630"/>South Africa and South-West Africa in that he had granted quotas. The hon. member for Bellville said:</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from a small live rock lobster export quota of 10 000 units in 1969 and 1970, Minister Haak never awarded any crayfish quotas during his term of office.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, ex-Minister Haak himself issued a press statement, which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> under the heading &#x201C;Haak replies to Wiley&#x2019;s allegations&#x201D; (Haak antwoord Wiley se skimpe). In that report he denied that he had ever granted fishing licences in South Africa and South-West Africa. In my previous speeches I had said that when Mr. Haak was Deputy Minister, it was the time of the rock lobster concessions. In addition, I said that on 1st January, 1963, 21 rock lobster concessions had been granted, in spite of the fact that three years previously the rock lobster industry had voluntarily decided to cut its quotas. The hon. member for Bellville said to me that ex-Minister Haak had never granted any rock lobster quotas. The hon. member is either ignorant or had been misled and given the wrong information by others or, even worse&#x2014;and I hope I am wrong&#x2014; deliberately tried to mislead this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I withdraw it. I have here a letter which ex-Minister Haak wrote to the Managing Director of Mid-West, Mr. A. P. du Preez. It is dated 10th March, 1964, and reads as follows: (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Sir,<br/>With reference to your letter of 11th January in the abovementioned regard, a quota for the export of 80 000 20 lb. cases of frozen rock lobster tails is hereby granted to the proposed company Wesbank Visserye Bpk. for the calendar year 1964,</block>

<p>At the end of the letter, which comprises a whole page, the following appears:</p>

<block name="quote">Seeing that diamond exploitation rights have been granted to another company in respect of the islands mentioned above and these rights must receive preference, it is essential that, in exploiting this rock lobster export quota, you will ensure that such exploitation rights are not interfered with or encroached upon in any way.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I referred to this island concession as well. One of these islands was situated in a rock lobster reserve in South-West Africa, where South-West African registered boats may not fish. The allocation was also made without the approval of the South-West African Administration. Then I referred to the &#x201C;compromise&#x201D; which had been made, because after the allocation of this concession there was a big fuss. People, including representatives of the Executive Committee of South-West Africa, went to see Dr. Verwoerd. Dr. Verwoerd arranged the &#x201C;compromise&#x201D;. The &#x201C;compromise&#x201D; was that the concession of 80 000 cases granted to Mid-West be withdrawn and that an even bigger quota of 94 000 cases be allocated to Angra Pequena, another A. P. du Preez company, to which a fishmeal licence at Luderitz had been granted a year before, as well as a rock lobster concession of 25 000 cases in order to make the company&#x2019;s activities profitable. The shareholders in Mid-West received preference shares in Angra Pequena as a <i>quid pro quo.</i> Sir, as far as my knowledge goes, this is the biggest allocation any company has received in the history of the rock lobster industry. Within the space of one year, the rock lobster production of Luderitz increased by 50 per cent.</p>

<p>I now come to the Minister of Economic Affairs. He was also going to expose my &#x201C;misrepresentations&#x201D;. He said that the hon. member for Bellville had given examples of them and that he wanted to give further examples, such as my allegation that Federale Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor at Walvis Bay and the Trust Bank at Luderitz had received fishmeal concessions. What are the facts, Mr. Speaker? In the case of SuidKunene, i.e. at Walyis Bay, there was a total of 2 million shares of 50 cents each. Three-quarter million of these shares were offered to the public, of which South-West officials. Nationalist Party Senators and members of the House of Assembly and <span class="col_8995-8996" refersTo="page_1631"/>members of the Legislative Assembly of South-West obtained 330 000 shares. The rest, i.e. 1,2 million out of the 2 million, went to Federate Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor. In the case of Angra Pequena there were 1,8 million shares, also of 50 cents each, and after the Nationalist Party members of the House of Assembly and of the Senate and members of the Legislative Assembly and officials of the South-West Administration had received a cut, 1,2 million out of the 1,8 million shares went to the Trust Bank. Sir, if these are not concessions for Federale Volksbeleggings, for Bonuskor and for the Trust Bank, I do not know! Mr. Speaker, in the light of that, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs will of course understand that I was entitled to ask whether the Paternoster concession was in fact a concession to the Nationalist Party, because the addresses are the same tool Now, Sir, I come to the factory ships. In this regard the Minister of Economic Affairs said &#x201C;it is untrue that South-West Africa had not been consulted before Dr. Diederichs made his factory allocations&#x201D;. Perhaps the Minister was not here: perhaps he did not listen, but in the same speech I said that Dr. Diederichs had recently risen in this House and said that he had gone to Dr. Verwoerd. &#x201C;I then said to Dr. Verwoerd&#x201D;, said Dr. Diederichs, &#x201C;that South-West Africa was opposed to it. Then he said that I should go and talk to South-West Africa.&#x201D; Now he must listen to what his Deputy Minister said in the Legislative Assembly in 1967 in regard to this Willem Barendsz licence (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Groups from South-West Africa came to speak to me about the Willem Barendsz, because the Willem Barendsz had to get a licence from the South-West African Administration, and I told these parties that they had no hope. Thereupon the same parties went to the Republic and the Republican authorties granted permission.</block>

<p>Then Dr. Diederichs went to Windhoek. As hon. members know, the Deputy Minister said in this House after the Executive Committee had seen Dr. Diederichs&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of considerations submitted to the Executive Committee, the Executive Committee gave its permission, subject to certain explicit conditions.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, before the commission had completed its work, according to the Deputy Minister, we read in the public press that two more factoryship licences had been granted to two concerns in the Republic, i.e. to the same Mr. A. P. du Preez and to the Ovenstones. To his regret they did not have time to lodge an objection.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Omaruru. He called me a fish vulture. He said I was against Suid-Kunene and the Angra Pequena concessions because the beneficiaries were Afrikaners. Sir, I want to make it quite clear that I am opposed to any over-exploitation of our natural assets by anybody at all, but particularly if it takes place as a result of the abuse of political power. The same hon. member asked why I had not objected to the allocations of 1968. I did object. It is recorded here in my first speech. I was as opposed to those allocations as to any other previous allocations when there were signs of over-exploitation.</p>

<p>I come now to a very interesting subject. This is the attitude of the hon. member for Omaruru towards the fishing industry of South-West Africa. I rose here recently and asked the hon. the Prime Minister for a judicial commission to inquire into the administration of the South African and South-West African fishing industry over the past 10 years, especially in regard to the issuing of licences and quotas. I did not go as far as the hon. member for Omaruru did, because he uses much stronger language. He speaks of curruption and bribery in the fishing industry of South-West Africa. I have here the minutes of proceedings which took place in March last year in Room No. 410 of the Forum Building. I should like to ask the hon. member now whether he was present at those proceedings. Those present were Mr. Jan Haak as Minister, Mr. Kitshoff as Secretary, Mr. Visser, his adviser, Mr. Botma, the present member for Omaruru, then the Mayor of Walvis Bay, Mr. Viljoen, Mr. Grobbelaar and Mr. Wilkens. What did the hon. member for Omaruru, a member of the Fishing Commission and the then Mayor of Walvis Bay, say? On page 3 he said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is great concern among the inhabitants of Walvis Bay and in the industry <span class="col_8997-8998" refersTo="page_1632"/>because there are indications that the fishing resources of South-West are becoming tremendously depleted, if they are not collapsing.</block>

<p>On page 4 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the general feeling in Walvis Bay that the granting of licences to the two factory ships was a big mistake and we feel that there has already been too much delay in finding a solution.</block>

<p>On page 5 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Over-exploitation is taking place. They (the factory ships) have their own patrol service to watch the State patrol service.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Omaruru said that the State patrol service was almost useless. Then he said on page 8 that a compromise should be made, because&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are very concerned about the over-exploitation, but if there should be a compromise in order to reduce exploitation, we feel it should be by means of a land-based factory, a land-based quota.</block>

<p>At this secret meeting, the hon. member for Omaruru said there would be a reaction, as reported on page 24 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You can expect a reaction from South-West Africa if this standpoint were to become known, a reaction of, let me put it very bluntly, &#x201C;Yes, now A. P. du Preez is getting away with crime. He did what he wanted to and now the State is paying him because they can do nothing eke to him&#x201D;. This would not be the first &#x201C;compromise&#x201D; made with Mr. A. P. du Preez by this Government</block>

<p>Then, on page 11 of these minutes, the hon. member for Omaruru said he had a further request and addressed the following words to Minister Haak&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A last request Mr. Minister, is that you should very seriously consider appointing a judicial commission in order to investigate the fishing industry in Walvis Bay. Over many years there have been major complaints of problems, corruption and bribery, and I believe it will never end before you appoint a commission, a judicial commission, Mr. Minister, which will determine once and for all whether this is the case, and if it is in fact the case, to what extent.</block>

<p>On page 20 the Secretary for Industries, Mr. Kitshoff, said in regard to this judicial commission which the hon. member for Omaruru had requested: &#x201C;Does this not concern past history and can it still serve any useful purpose to dig up the matters of the past again at this stage?&#x201D; On the same page, namely page 20, the hon. member for Omaruru said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Minister, yes, my reply is in fact that a crime remains a crime no matter how long ago it was committed.</block>

<p>And then on page 21 he said&#x2026;</p>

<block name="quote">furthermore, I want to remind you that it applies not only to the fishing industry of Walvis Bay, but also to the rock lobster industry at Luderitz. These are complaints which are being bandied about generally and which are not good for the officials, nor for the State. It creates the impression that it is being done openly.</block>

<p>Mr. Haak, the then Minister of Economic Affairs, said at the end of the proceedings that he would submit the minutes of those proceedings to his colleagues in the Cabinet as soon as possible and that the persons who had attended these proceedings would soon be informed of the decision of the Cabinet. However, Mr. Haak did not carry out his promise. The factory ships are still on the coast of South-West Africa. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister today to terminate these activities of the factory ships.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to address a few words to the hon. the Prime Minister himself.</p>

<p>&#x2020;A short while ago I said that I believed that the hon. the Prime Minister, when he said last year that only the highest standards should be maintained in South African public life, was absolutely sincere and that he meant what he said. I still believe that. The country is, however, filled with rumours about fish concessions. A valuable economic asset is in potential danger as a result of over-exploitation and I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister again this afternoon to appoint a judicial commission to examine the administration of the fishing industry in South-West Africa <span class="col_8999-9000" refersTo="page_1633"/>and in the Republic over the last decade, and more particularly to go into the question of the issue of licences and quotas. I have complete confidence that the hon. member for Omaruru will be completely at one with me in making this request for a judicial commission which he himself made in March last year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the political fight in South Africa has undergone an important shift of emphasis. The United Party accepts and realizes that the National Party cannot be conquered if it is tackled on its principles, because it knows that the principles and the policy of the National Party are those which the people of South Africa want. The National Party&#x2019;s principles, policy and history are very clear, and indeed that is why the National Party is also the party for the future of South Africa. The United Party is spineless, without principle and a party whose history counts against it. It is a party without a future. I want to say in what respect the political fight in South Africa has undergone a shift of emphasis. Because the United Party, its leaders and its propagandists realize that the National Party cannot be tackled on its principles or its policy, they have attempted in recent years to injure the National Party in another way. What is this other way? The United Party asked itself in what respect it lagged furthest behind the National Party, other than in its policy and principles. The answer was obvious. The United Party does not have the National Party&#x2019;s leaders. The United Party does not have the John Vorsters, the Ben Schoemans, the P. W. Bothas, the M C. Bothas and all the others. The United Party is bankrupt as far as leadership goes; the United Party lags behind the National Party as far as leadership is concerned, and they know that if one is to win the political struggle, as is the case anywhere in the world, one must have the leaders who can carry one&#x2019;s banners. [Interjections.] These people, who can only make a lot of noise and shout &#x201D; Oh! &#x201D;, can take note of the fact that they do not have the leaders who can lead that party to victory in South Africa. Because they do not have the leaders, they have, for the past few years, been engaged in a concentrated attack on the integrity of the leaders of the National Party. They are trying to attack the integrity and the honesty of the leaders of the National Party. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The United Party&#x2019;s attack has now shifted towards the integrity and the honesty of our leaders. What we now see here today, these attacks that are being made in connection with the Agliotli case, attacks that are unfair, unreasonable and unjust, are not isolated cases, but a part of an overall pattern throughout the years. Sir, I now want to give you a few of these examples to show you how the United Party&#x2019;s pattern of attack has developed over the past few months.</p>

<p>We see, for example, a scandalous attack from the Leader of the Opposition, who published an article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> under the heading &#x201C;Nat M.P.s made money in strange ways&#x201D;. It is an article which, with simply one sweep, slandered everyone on this side of the House. It was an endeavour to sow mistrust in the people of South Africa with respect to the honesty <span class="col_9001-9002" refersTo="page_1634"/>of every member of the House of Assembly on this side. When the Leader of the Opposition was challenged, on more than one occasion by the hon. the Minister of Community Development, to support his accusation, he bowed his head and kept quiet, as he has done so many times when he should have spoken.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to give you another example of this pattern which is developing. I want to tell you about all this gossip that we had in connection with Land Bank loans, everything being aimed at attacking the integrity and the honesty of the Government. The falsity of every attack has definitely been proven in the past. There are the fish stories which we had recently, and had to listen to again today. The hon. member for Simonstown&#x2019;s attack was analyzed by this side of the House, by the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Deputy Minister. The hon. member was shown up as a person who made representations that are untrue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Were they misrepresentations?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>They were misrepresentations. The one statement after the other was analyzed and rejected by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>Just recently we had the question of Ministers&#x2019; shares. No specific complaint was made against any Minister. An impression was merely created. It merely had to seem as if there was something &#x201C;fishy&#x201D;. It must look as if there is something wrong. Whether they can prove their charges or not is of no importance; they are not interested in that. They just want to create the impression that there is something fishy going on. They are, as I said the other day, a party bent on striking a blow and then running away but the blow it strikes is not a blow to the chin of the National Party and its leaders. Each time it is a dirty blow, a blow below the belt, and then they run away.</p>

<p>Then we came to the Agliotti case. What is the position in connection with the Agliotti case, if we give a nice analysis of the matter? hon. members will know that in terms of section 14 of the Expropriation Act, the Minister of Agriculture has certain powers which he has delegated to the two senior officials of his department. Will hon. members opposite, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, tell us whether the Minister did wrong in that instance? Did the Minister do wrong in delegating the powers? That is what they must tell us. They must specifically tell us whether the Minister made a mistake there. Did he act wrongly in delegating those powers to his senior officials? Sir, he did not act wrongly is doing so. The law provides for the fact that he may do so. The law gives the Minister the power to do so. Then we must also remember that when this legislation was before Parliament in 1965, that side of the House supported it. I have their Hansard here. On that occasion, when the principle in this legislation, i.e. that the Minister may delegate his powers, was discussed, the hon. member for Durban Point said (translation): &#x201C;The hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s wishes will be fulfilled; we shall support this Bill&#x201D;. That was the standpoint of that side of the House. They supported it. They supported this principle. Now the Minister has acted in terms of that provision. He delegated his powers.</p>

<p>Sir, the corpulent scope of the hon. member for Umlazi has always been a slight stumbling block in this House!</p>

<p>The Minister has now delegated his powers. Of course he supervised the delegation of those powers. It is because of his supervision that he discovered that there was something wrong. If he had not exercised supervision, if he had not been in contact with the department, and if he had not made sure that what they did was right, how would he have known about this transaction on 6th March? Surely it is as clear as daylight. Sir, hon. members on that side are fishing on dry land. This side of the House welcomes criticism, as the hon. the Minister of the Interior also said, because this side does not only want to govern in the interests of the National Party. This side of the House wants to govern South Africa in the interests of South Africa. Any constructive criticism is taken to heart, but what do we have here? Do we have criticism of a constructive nature here? Do we have here criticism that is well-founded? The hon. member for Durban North generally slandered the entire Public Service, and the Public Service officials must also take note of that. He said (translation): &#x201D; We have now had a look into one department. Now we see what is going on in that department. What is not going on in all the other departments?&#x201D; The insinuation is dear, i.e. that the entire Public Service in South Africa could be corrupt. Is the hon. member not ashamed of such conduct? We on this side of the House want to take the strongest exception to the unjustified, slanderous, mendacious criticism we have got from that side of the House.</p>

<p>Sir, in this connection there is also another important aspect that should deserve the attention of this House. The hon. member for Durban North, and to a greater extent the <i>Sunday Timas</i> that was published yesterday, proceeds from the standpoint that the official, Mr. Venter, must be guilty of fraud or corruption. Mr. Chairman, here we had a judicial commission which arrived at certain specific findings. The hon. members on that side and the <i>Sunday Times</i> began to draw conclusions from those findings. In this connection I quote to you what the <i>Sunday Times</i> stated yesterday, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Just what this improper connection is the commissioner does not say, but since he links it with material representation, irregularities and <i>mala fides</i> and cheque books, the inescapable inference is that the improper connection between Mr. Agliotti and Mr. Venter involved dishonesty.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not know whether Mr. Venter was dishonest or not. One thing I do know, and that is that it is improper of the <i>Sunday Times</i> to find him guilty before he has been charged. It is improper of the <i>Sunday Times</i> to say, as the hon. members for Durban North and Zululand said, that the &#x201C;inescapable inference is this and that&#x201D;. They are not judges. They are not entitled to do this. They must wait until this matter comes before a court.</p>

<p>I am very glad the hon. member is asking that question. I am not a judge. Neither am I prepared to assume the role of a judge on a political platform, because that is improper. The conclusions to be drawn here are conclusions that must be drawn by a court of law.</p>

<p>A week or two ago an article appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail.</i> I think it was written by one of their correspondents. Abater Spark. The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> and this side of the House are violent political opponents, but there was a lot in that article that I could agree with. Criticism was expressed about the Trust Bank case, i.e. about the fact that certain newspapers had already adopted the standpoint that those people were guilty, and tried to create the impression with the public that the relevant persons were guilty of a crime. Perhaps they are guilty, perhaps they are innocent. We must wait until a court has delivered that verdict. We must wait until a court has decided whether a person is guilty or innocent. We do not know what explanation he has. I now trust that the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> will apply to this case the standpoint which it adopted on that occasion, a principle that I can agree with, and also reprimand the <i>Sunday Times</i> <span class="col_9005-9006" refersTo="page_1636"/>about such a &#x201C;trial by newspaper&#x201D;. I again want to refer to the speeches of the hon. members on that side of the House, where the standpoint has already been adopted that the man is guilty of a crime. <i>Inter alia</i>, I want to tell the hon. member for Durban North, who ought to know better, that this is altogether the wrong way to behave.</p>

<p>If we see this matter as a whole, we reach a few conclusions. The one important conclusion is that the Minister of Agriculture took immediate action. The second conclusion is that the hon. the Preim Minister took immediate action. The third conclusion is that the hon. the Prime Minister was not afraid, for a single moment, to expose the matter in public even if something wrong had taken place. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s standpoint was very clearly that if something was wrong, the cards should be laid on the table. But what more did the Government do? On the part of the Government two advocates were appointed to handle the Government&#x2019;s interests with the commission. Before the commission these two advocates exhaustively cross-examined Agliotti and the other officials of the departments. Hon. members on that side of the House can take note of what was said about the actions of these advocates. In paragraph 17 of the report the hon. commissioner states the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I also wish to express my sincere appreciation to Advocates Strydom and Van Rooyen for their help.</block>

<p>They are the advocates who acted on behalf of the Government&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a result of their searching examination of the witnesses it was not difficult for me to determine where the truth lay. But they deserve another special word of thanks for their full and valuable argument of the last two aspects of my terms of reference at the end of the proceedings. Their arguments also testified to penetrating study and research. In drawing up my Report I relied on their research work to a very great extent.</block>

<p>These are people who acted for the State, and to whom the State said: &#x201C;You must expose this matter to the bone, because I want to get at the truth&#x201D;. Are those the actions of a government that is trying to cover things up; are those the actions of a government that fears for its integrity; are those the actions of a government that is scared to look the people of South Africa in the eye; are those the actions of a government that is not worthy of the confidence of the people of South Africa? The actions of the Government have, of course, been an example from beginning to end of how a government ought to rule. I want to associate myself with previous speakers, who have already expressed appreciation to the Prime Minister for the decisiveness with which he acted, and with which we believe he will act in the future to eliminate any possibility of corruption and dishonesty in the Public Service, wherever it may rear its head. What is more, we believe that the Prime Minister would be prepared to do this irrespective of persons, This matter again shows that we on this side of the House, and the people of South Africa, can have confidence in the Prime Minister, the entire Cabinet and the Government. And that, too, is exactly what our position is&#x2014;we trust them fully!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Pretoria Central was stating the obvious when he announced to the world that he was no Judge. The way he has handled his brief shows that he is not much of an advocate either. We have had two advocates now brought into put up a defence against the charges brought by this side of the House and neither of them has given any answer on the basic issues involved. They have fluffed, blustered, threatened and accused this side of the House of scandal mongering. They have drawn red herrings across the trail, but they have avoided the fundamental issues that are at stake. The hon. member for Pretoria Central said that the Government had appointed advocates. Of course he did not say that they were appointed by the Treasury to look after the interests of the Treasury, but not by the Department of Land Tenure.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the simple issue slated by the hon. member for Prinshof. He said that the test applied by my Leader is &#x201C;too high&#x201D;. I am quoting him correctly? He agrees. During a debate last week the hon. the Prime Minister accepted full responsibility for each of his Ministers for their administration as well as their integrity. Nobody on <span class="col_9007-9008" refersTo="page_1637"/>this side of the House has impugned the integrity of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. There has been no suspicion of corruption or anything improper in the actions of the hon. the Minister for Agriculture. But the hon. the Prime Minister accepted responsibility not only for the integrity but also for the administration of his Ministers. Our attack is on the administration of the Minister concerned. We have stated that he failed. Now there is a simple test and I put this to the hon. the Prime Minister; is he prepared to produce to this House the cheque for R 7&#x00BD; million and to indicate all the persons by whom it was signed or endorsed and the date on which it was paid out by the Reserve Bank?</p>

<p>That is the issue, because we have charged the hon. the Minister with failing to take appropriate steps after he heard by accident of the transaction. We have charged that he failed to take the necessary steps to stop it when he came beware of it. The hon. the Minister said that it was too late. But he knew about this on the Friday afternoon. The cheque was presented on the following day, the Saturday. Why did the hon. the Minister not act between the time he became aware of this and the time that that cheque was presented? He could have slopped it. If the Reserve Bank was open to pay it, then the hon. the Minister could have got in touch with them. If they were not open, as he claimed, then the cheque could not have been paid and he could have stopped it immediately when the bank opened. But whichever way it works, we charge the hon. the Minister with not having acted after it was within his knowledge that this cheque had been paid and after, in his own admission, he was not satisfied with the situation as he saw it.</p>

<p>It really is very difficult if one does not have a policy.</p>

<p>Mr. W. V. RAW; This is a question of administration. We have charged, in the first place, that the hon. the Minister did not maintain control of his department and, in the second place, that when he became aware of this, he did not act. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Defence has left. The hon. member for Pretoria Central quoted a speech which I made during the debate on a Bill passed by this House this year dealing with the delegation of power in the Armaments Amendment Bill. In that speech I stated, on behalf of this side of the House, that we were not entirely happy about the delegation of power. The hon. the Minister of Defence replied immediately that he would ensure by regulation that complete control over delegated powers was maintained and that there was a &#x201C;report back&#x201D; to the Armaments Board on all use of delegated power. He stated that and accepted it unequivocally as being essential in the delegation of powers.</p>

<p>In other words, he accepted that if you delegate power you must maintain control <span class="col_9009-9010" refersTo="page_1638"/>over the exercise of that delegation and you must have knowledge. Sir, this is a colleague of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. In another department there is another standard, a different standard, but the hon. the Minister says, &#x201C;I can delegate powers and I am not interested in what happens after that. If they want to come to me, they will tell me if they think that there is anything wrong with the case&#x201D;, but when there is a R7&#x00BD; million transaction, then they do not tell him about it. He shrugs his shoulders and asks: &#x201C;What could I do about it?&#x201D; I do not know what he could do about it then; but I know that he could have maintained better control over his department. Sir, if this is the way in which the money of the taxpayer of South Africa is going to be handled then I, together with the leader of this Party, believe that that hon. Minister should resign. The taxpayers of South Africa deserve better control over the spending of their money.</p>

<p>Sir, we now have the date on which this cheque was deposited in Barclays Bank in Cape Town.</p>

I do not know what he was doing that week-end, whether he was fishing or golfing. But he was not looking after the interests of South Africa or the money of the taxpayers of South Africa, because on Saturday morning or on Monday morning he could have taken steps. Sir, by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own admission he knew that a cheque for R7&#x00BD; million had been signed; he was unhappy about the circumstances of it; he wanted to stop it and he did not lift a little finger to stop it. By his own admission he did not do a single thing to stop it and that alone. Sir, is reason for the hon. the Minister to resign.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, then we come to an associated issue. We find now from the hon. the Minister of the Interior that he withdraws passports because of what he reads in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> When challenged and asked by the hon. member for Zululand: &#x201D; Why did you withdraw Agiiotti&#x2019;s passport and not Venter's?&#x201D; He got up and asked: &#x201C;But was Venter&#x2019;s name mentioned in the <i>Sunday Times?&#x201D; </i> In other words, Sir, the hon. the Minister acts on a Press report in withdrawing one passport and because the other name is not mentioned he does not withdraw that person&#x2019;s passport. But, Sir. what about joint Cabinet responsibility; what about the passing of information from one department to another? Not a word about that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Todd issued the instruction, but he did not sign. Now we are getting curiouser and curiouser. Earlier on the hon. the Minister said that Mr. Todd signed the cheque; he said that directly and clearly and unequivocally. Now, a few hours later, when we start asking who the signatories are. he says that Mr. Todd only gave the instruction and two officials simply acted on those instructions and signed the cheque. It does make a difference, Sir. It makes a difference in regard to the sort of control the hon. the Minister exercises over his department. And we find now that he does not even exercise it directly or indirectly through the delegated authorities, but the delegate to whom he has had delegated the authority then simply issues instructions and other people sign the cheques; and having signed the cheque, we find it presented on a Saturday morning and only cashed on Monday, and the Minister did nothing at all to stop its payment.</p>

<p>Yet, Sir, we are asked to pay taxes. We will deal with another measure tomorrow where the public will be asked to pay another R42 million. For what? To be spent like this? No, I regret to say that we have received no satisfaction as to the background of inefficiency involving this whole case, the whole administration before and at the time of the case, the inefficiency of the hon. the Minister who is responsible to this Parliament and who is responsible to the hon. the Prime Minister. And the hon. the Prime Minister accepted and still accepts responsibility for his Cabinet. He then must accept responsibility for what the hon. the Minister of Agriculture failed to do, and that blows to smithereens the arguments of the two hon. members from Pretoria who tried to exonerate the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>We are also told that the case is proven because the hon. the Prime Minister acted before the <i>Sunday Times</i> was on the streets. In other words, what is important is whether the Government beat the <i>Sunday Times.</i> That is what is important to them. But this is what, I think is also important to the people. The Prime Minister knew about this for a week and he was waiting for a report from the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, but when it became a political issue he acted. As long as it was merely a matter of maladministration. the Prime Minister was prepared to wait for a report, but when it became a political issue, when a candidate, the hon. member for Boksburg, got up and said that in the streets of Boksburg stories were flying around, it became a political issue which would cost votes. As soon as votes were involved, the hon. the Prime Minister immediately said he would deal with it and he would appoint an investigation. <span class="col_9013-9014" refersTo="page_1640"/>After he had given the assurance to his conference, he telephoned the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. In other words, when it became a political issue it became important, but before that it was going to take its course until the next Cabinet meeting.</p>

<p>Now we are accused of stirring up agitation and of sowing suspicion. The hon. member for Pretoria Central saved me the trouble, because he listed a whole series of issues about which the public are concerned. and not just the Agliotti case. He mentioned the Land Bank case, and he blamed the United Party. It was not the United Party which lent a Cabinet Minister R118 000. It was not the United Party; it was the Land Bank which did it. It was not the United Party which gave loans of R&#x00BC; million, R&#x00BD; million, etc. It was not we who did it, but because we drew attention to these things we are then accused of scandal mongering. It was not the hon. member for Simonstown who issued fish concessions, but we are accused because we bring it to the notice of the public. It was not the United Party which issued diamond concessions. It was not the United Party which employed road transportation inspectors, where in Natal every single official was convicted, except the head official who got off on appeal. But every single official was convicted of corruption in one department in Natal. We are not in charge of community development where an official has now been charged with 117 charges of corruption.</p>

<p>I have made a specific accusation against the Minister of Agriculture. He failed to act efficiently in maintaining control over his delegated authority; he failed as a Minister and he should resign. This is specific enough and one cannot be more specific than that. Last year the voters of South Africa who voted for this Government put question marks behind their votes in their minds. The question mark has two loops. They said &#x201C;We will vote for you again, but where are you taking South Africa and, secondly, how are you governing South Africa?&#x201D; The Prime Minister had promised them &#x201C;opknapping&#x201D;. He said that there would be an &#x201C;opknapping&#x201D; of Government administration and that the departments and the Minister would have to pull their socks up and that we would have efficiency. This session has <span class="col_9015-9016" refersTo="page_1641"/>now passed and in this session, as it draws to its conclusion, we have now had six months in which the hon. the Minister of the Government have had the opportunity to say to what extent this &#x201C;opknapping&#x201D; had taken place to improve the administration, But the record is a sorry one. It is a sorry one as you go down the ranks. Minister after Minister has shown that he has failed to streamline or to bring about the promised efficiency in his department. The only other thing that has become clear during this session is the answer to the question: Where was the Nationalist Party Government going after the general election? The answer is that it went back into the &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; fold, so much so that it is bringing into this House when we next gather here, one of the acknowledged leaders of the &#x201C;verkrampte&#x201D; movement. There are your two answers. Where are we going under this Government? Back into &#x201C;verkramptheid&#x201D;. Is the Government administering efficiently? The answer is &#x201C;no&#x201D; right through.</p>

<p>There is an alternative, with which I will not have time to deal. But I want to say that South Africa, when we have a change of Government, will look very different from what it looks now. It will look different, for this reason&#x2014;I make no apologies for saying this again; I have said it before. At the end of the last World War, when South Africans walked down the streets of foreign cities, they used to do so wearing shoulder tabs with &#x201C;South Africa&#x201D; on them because they were so proud to show that they came from South Africa. When they walked down the streets of the capitals of the West. people stopped them and said &#x201C;I am proud to shake the hand of a South African&#x201D;. We were proud to be South Africans, so proud that we put the name of our country on our shoulder, so that every man could see where we came from. The hon. Minister of Defence has just come back from London, where they nut smoke bombs under his motor car and threw tomatoes. Mr. Speaker, we were proud to be South Africans, and that is the fundamental thing missing among the people of South Africa today&#x2014; their pride in being a South African: their ability to hold up their head amongst all men and to say &#x201C;I am proud to be a South African&#x201D;. &#x201C;I have nothing of which I am ashamed.&#x201D; *</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker I have risen merely in order to make a few observations in regard to this debate. I returned to Cape Town only this morning, and therefore I cannot and do not want to participate in a long debate. Before I come to the matter which is the reason for my having risen, namely the Agliotti case, I just want to mention a few general points. The hon. member for Durban Point, who has just resumed his seat, tried to create the impression that the National Party was to blame for the fact that communistic and other riff-raff in England and in other parts of the world were rising up against South Africa. I want to say to the hon. member that I am sorry he has found it necessary to use this type of argument for the purposes of party-political propaganda, because however much I differ with the hon. member for Durban Point, I have always regarded him as a good South African. For this reason I found it all the more shocking that the hon. member put forward that type of argument. Sir, it will be of no avail for us to debate this matter any further across the floor of this House. Surely the hon. member for Durban Point and every other hon. member on that side of this House knows that the problems facing South Africa, the problems of the hostile attitude of the communistic states and of the Afro-Asian states, did not start under the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party. Surely the hon. member is aware that they already started when Gen. Smuts was our representative at the U.N. Surely the hon. member knows that as far back as the years 1945, 1946 and 1947, there were items on the agenda at United Party congresses in connection with these evil attacks on South Africa. The hon. member is shaking his head because he knows this is the case. Surely he knows it is the case that South Africa lost the struggle for South-West Africa against India in the U.N. in Gen. Smuts&#x2019;s time already.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it does not matter whether the Western countries were on our side. Can the hon. member tell me why. when the matter of the incorporation of South-West Africa came up for discussion&#x2014;it was the standpoint of Gen. Smuts that it should be incorporated&#x2014;the Western countries would not grant it? At that time die Black states were not in the majority in the U.N. Surely the hon. member knows that the agitation against South Africa started in those years already and that in principle we lost the struggle in those years already and, furthermore, that we already lost that struggle on a numerical basis in those years, before all these Black states came into being. Surely the hon. member knows this. This is the background against which South Africa is still continuing its struggle. I have always believed and hoped that in our struggle against these powers in the world, we would have the support of those who think as the hon. member for Durban Point does. It would be an evil day for me if I had to admit that I could no longer rely on the hon. member for Durban Point in that regard.</p>

<p>While speaking about the many matters he mentioned, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did us another injustice in passing. This was when he referred to the education which is provided to all colour groups in South Africa. The hon. member gave the impression to people outside that this was a matter we were neglecting, and that it was something with which we should be charged in the outside world. Sir, what we are doing in the interests of the education of white, yellow and black here in South Africa, provides South Africa with the strongest standpoint it can adopt in relation to the world and in relation to Africa. This is South Africa&#x2019;s strong point. Do these figures not have significance for the Leader of the Opposition as well? We know we have compulsory education in South Africa as far as the Whites are concerned. I quoted the figures on another occasion, but in reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s argument I want to place them on record. In the past 10 years, 155 000 more White children have been enrolled at schools. The argument can quite rightly be put forward that there is compulsory education as far as the Whites are concerned. But let us look at the others. Let us see what the position is in regard to the Coloured people. Over a period of ten years the number of Coloured children attending school has increased to 515 000, i.e. over a period of ten years 210 000 more Coloured children have attended schools in South Africa, and without compulsory education at that. Over the past ten years the number of Bantu children <span class="col_9019-9020" refersTo="page_1643"/>attending school in South Africa has increased to 2 700 000, an increase of 1 340 000. Surely this is a proud record which South Africa can present to the world. Surely this is a proud record which South Africa can present to Africa. Why must we belittle it in our own Parliament? I just want to put the record straight in this regard. Why, considering the knowledge which my friend the Leader of the Opposition has, did he belittle Senator Horwood for debating purposes in this House this morning? Why did he compare the figure given by Senator Horwood with that of Dr. Franszen? The figure given by Dr. Franszen is the present one. Surely my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition knows that Prof. Horwood quoted his figure from a periodical which appeared in September, 1964. The figure of 3 per cent which Prof, Horwood indicated in that article, is the figure of 1962 and not of 1970. [Interjections.] But the impression was given to the world that Senator Horwood had said that for this year, i.e. the current one, we were spending 3 per cent, while the figure quoted by Prof. Horwood was the one for 1962. But why did he not go further? Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wanted to disparage Senator Horwood, why did he not quote what Senator Horwood had said in the Senate on 25th February, 1971?</p>

<p>I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is the position today? Last year, taking our higher education, which is crucial, we spent in this country in one year 50 per cent more than the year before. So the Budget went up by 50 per cent on higher education alone.</block>

<p>Then he quoted certain figures. This is not fair. If one wants to belittle an English-speaking person because he joined the National Party, then do so on the facts and not in this way. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now come to the Agliotti case. The first knowledge I had of this matter was when a report appeared in <i>Die Beeld</i> on Sunday, 8th March. In that report reference was made to valuable clay deposits allegedly contained in that land, land which was to be bought for extensions to the Jan Smuts Airport. But naturally, in the first place, I regarded it as a large sum of money. In the second place, because the clay was so valuable, I questioned whether one should bury that valuable clay under a tarred surface and thought whether one should not make some other plan. It is for that reason that the matter attracted my attention. I was aware that land was expensive. I was aware that if it contained such clay, it must naturally be much more expensive, but precisely how expensive I, as a layman, of course did not know. If it was true that the clay was so valuable, I was not keen that it should be buried. For that reason I asked the Cabinet about the matter on the Monday. It was election time. During that period the Cabinet met on Mondays. As hon. members opposite know, during the rest of the week we were dispersed all over the country holding meetings. I myself was away in the course of that week. Naturally I made inquiries, but the next Cabinet meeting would take place on the following Monday only. I want to repeat that the background to the case was that it was election time and that everybody was travelling because we had engagements which had been made long before. That same Saturday morning I had come from Pietermaritzburg and I went directly to the candidates&#x2019; conference. At that conference various matters were discussed and this matter was mentioned by the hon. member for Boksburg, Mr. J. P. A. Reyneke. As far as I can remember, it was amplified by the hon. member for Brentwood, Dr. W. L. Vosloo, who also comes from that area. After I had taken cognizance of the matters which Mr. Reyneke mentioned this morning as well, and of those which I had heard in the meantime, I said on that occasion that I would announce a commission to investigate that matter. I did in fact appoint the commission.</p>

<p>I found it interesting that this debate was opened by my hon. friend the member for Durban North. I found it noteworthy, but could understand it. After all, he is the bright boy of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I remember that they described him as such on occasion. Therefore I can understand that the hon. member opened the debate. I do not mind what the hon. member said, but he should not speak without his book. He should at least first make inquiries about his facts. The hon. member said we had appointed judges in regard to other matters. I make no apology for having done that. Across the floor of this House I have already&#x2026;</p>

<p>If the hon. member did not ask that question, I apologize to him. The hon. member for Zululand asked why a magistrate, and not a judge, had been appointed in this case. There was a very good reason for that. I asked the Minister of Justice for a judge at the time. However, it was envisaged at the time that the Agliotti case would be very protracted. The Minister of Justice explained his difficulties in making judges available to me, and because it was expected that the matter would extend over months, the Minister of Justice recommended to me that I should not appoint a judge, but a senior magistrate. For that reason the senior magistrate of Bloemfontein, Mr. Lindeque, was appointed to conduct this inquiry.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I see absolutely nothing wrong in a magistrate investigating the case of someone who is senior to him in the Service. After all, he tries people who are senior to him in the Service and sends them to gaol. Why can he not report on their conduct?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. M. CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why then did the hon. gentleman try in the first instance for a judge?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because I should have liked to have it that way. Because, in the nature of things, a judge has more authority than a magistrate. But as far as I am concerned, I want to say I have full confidence in every judge and in every magistrate sitting on the bench in South Africa. Therefore I was perfectly satisfied to accept a magistrate, considering the fact that the hon. the Minister could not spare a judge for such a long period. I could understand his difficulty.</p>

<p>On 24th March, if I have the date correct, the terms of reference were published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and the hearing started. Hon. members will notice right at the beginning of this report, in paragraph 7, that on 21st April, 1970, a further proclamation was issued and that the terms of reference of the commission were amended in order to give advocates Strydom and Van Rooyen the opportunity to appear before the commission. I accept full responsibility for that because I personally instructed advocates Strydom and Van Rooyen to appear before that commission. I did so for very good reasons. The main factor in this case was the value of the clay in that land. From the course of the evidence it was clear to me that it was just possible that, considering the Behr-Lombaard Report, the commission would accept that that clay was in fact worth that amount of money. As a result of personal inquiries I made, it came to my attention that these two advocates had specialized knowledge not only of expropriation, but also of valuations in the case of expropriations. I felt that the commission should have the best legal advice available to it. I held consultations with these advocates and they told me that the basis on which the valuation had been made in the first place, was wrong. They satisfied me that the basis was wrong. Because they had satisfied me, I gave them the opportunity to appear before the commission in order to contest the basis on which the original <span class="col_9023-9024" refersTo="page_1645"/>valuation had been made. I now want to tell this House that if the matter had not been approached on the principle of attacking the basis of the valuation, the original valuation would have remained and the court would have had no option but to accept it. It would have remained. If one examines the evidence initially submitted, it is very clear that it would have been accepted just like that; in other words, if I had not intervened at that moment, this full amount would eventually have been paid for this land.</p>

<p>Sir. the ordinary person evaluating land has no knowledge of what lies beneath the surface of the land; he can evaluate only the surface. But because one had to deal with a highly technical matter and because two persons. Prof. Lombaard and Prof. Behr, both highly qualified geologists, were concerned here, it goes without saying that one would have to accept their valuation unless one contested the basis on which the valuation had been made.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>They evaluated on two bases and arrived at two answers. Which one did you want to accept?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I did not want to accept either of them, because after I had held consultations, both were unacceptable to me. Because I felt the basis was wrong, I instructed Strydom and Van Rooyen to appear before this commission. As a result the regulations were amended and a particularly thorough cross-examination of all officials and witnesses who appeared there was conducted. As a result it appeared that everything was not in order and that there was room for a great deal of suspicion. I am purposely using the words &#x201C;room for a great deal of suspicion&#x201D;. When that suspicion arose, the police were instructed in September last year to investigate the matter because it appeared that everything was not in order.</p>

<p>But now I come to hon. members opposite. What is in fact their objection, as they argued here today? Their objection is that we have not already convicted and hanged Venter&#x2014;hon. members opposite who continually base their arguments on the sacrosanct principle that a man is not guilty before he has been found guilty, hon. members who continually accuse us of violating that legal rule. Sir, what has been done in this regard? When it seemed as though something was wrong here&#x2014; and at the start there was nothing obvious to indicate that a dishonest transaction had taken place here; there was nothing <i>ex facie</i> the documents which indicated that something dishonest had taken place here &#x2014;a commission was appointed at the very first opportunity, because we wanted to make absolutely certain that everything was in order. Sir, the inquiry by the commission took its course, and even before the report was submitted the matter was referred to the police. When the report was received, it was immediately referred to the Attorney-General. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me for the dates. The commission was appointed on 20th March. 1970. The commissioner sent his report to my office on 14th December, 1970. I examined it on 22nd January, 1971, after the holidays, when we arrived in Cape Town, and on 25th January it was transmitted to the Attorney-General, At that same time I issued instructions that it be translated, and that translation was completed on 30th March, 1971. My department checked that translation and on 16th April, just after the Easter recess, they sent it through to the Government Printer, who in turn sent it to Cape and Transvaal Printers in Cape Town, which has the printing contract. They sent the printed report back on 1st June, and on 3rd June it was tabled. Surely, if I had wanted to keep this report away from Parliament, it would have been the easiest thing in the world to do. But these are the dates concerned. and at the very first opportunity I submitted it to Parliament. I therefore want to say that, as far as I am concerned, there is nothing I had to do that I neglected &#x2022;to do. I want to make it very clear that I spared nobody in this process and would have spared nobody. What more could I have done? What more can any Government do than to give the police written instructions, the moment there seems to be any irregularity, to examine that irregularity in order to determine whether <span class="col_9025-9026" refersTo="page_1646"/>there should be any prosecution, because it is after all the duty of the police to investigate it and to submit the prosecution to the Attorney-General. Since it was suggested in the report that the report should be submitted to the Attorney-General, what more could I do than to submit it to the Attorney-General immediately on receiving it? Does this look like a case of people wanting to hide something?</p>

<p>But let us look at the Minister now. The Minister told us here that these officials had acted in terms of a delegation, and there is nothing strange about officials acting in terms of a delegation. Officials have been acting in terms of delegations in South Africa since 1910, and until this problem arose, it worked satisfactorily and no problems arose from it. Hon. members now adopt the attitude that in this case there are in fact officials who have been guilty of dishonesty. On what grounds can we say this at this moment? At this moment we can only say that there are many things that seem suspicious, but surely we cannot set ourselves up here as judges before the police have investigated the matter, before the Attorney-General has examined it and before the Supreme Court has indicated the guilty party.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We shall come to that. I shall come to the reason why we did not take away his passport. But all I want to say at this moment, is that I am not prepared to say that Venter enriched himself; this will have to be determined by the court when the police have investigated the matter, and if the police find that there is a case to take to court and the Attorney-General finds that there is a case in respect of which a prosecution must be instituted. I do not know what the investigation will produce. I only know that my instruction is that all matters relating to this case must be investigated, no matter who is involved. This is what I know, and if it becomes clear from that investigation that these officials or other officials of that or of other departments have previously been guilty of such irregularities, they will all be brought to book.</p>

<p>What did the hon. member for Durban Point do now? He mentioned the cases here of officials who had transgressed. Surely, like private people, officials have transgressed over all the years. That is not the argument. The point is not whether officials transgress, but what a Government does when it becomes aware of that transgression, whether it lakes action or not. Hon. members on that side of this House must not contrast their past in this regard. I need only mention Castle Mansions in Johannesburg in passing and hon. members opposite would know what I am referring to. It is a question of whether one covers up or takes action. I want to repeat very clearly that in every case where a transgression has come to our notice, the matter has been investigated, and this will be done in future as well and those people will be dealt with in terms of the law.</p>

<p>Then, as far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, the hon. the Minister made that delegation. This delegation system has worked well for years, but now, in this one case, it has not worked. I have discussed the matter with the Minister, and we have rectified the matter and implemented another system, as one would naturally do after one has found that something like this does not work. But what crime has the Minister committed? What action did the Minister take which suggests that he is not competent to act as a Minister in this regard?</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Prime Minister? If there was no supervision, how does he or the Minister know that this was the only case?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But I have just told the hon. member that this instruction given to the Police is not limited to this one aspect of the matter. Surely it is obvious that it will cover a wide field. <span class="col_9027-9028" refersTo="page_1647"/>An exceptionally wide field will be covered in respect of this particular official. What more can one do in that regard? I want to make it very clear that if the Minister was negligent or irresponsible in this regard or if he shut his eyes to this sort of thing, I would obviously have asked him to resign from the Cabinet, because I cannot allow something like that. Must I take instructions from hon. members opposite, merely on account of the slandering of people across the floor of this House for lack of other matters of discourse? I want to tell hon. members opposite that, as far as I am concerned, I am man enough to decide for myself whether or not Ministers are competent to serve in the Cabinet, In that regard I shall not allow myself to be dictated to by anyone on the other side. My hon. friend from Durban North again had his usual dreams today of his party coming into power. Since the provincial council elections last year, there have been eight vacancies, either in the provincial council or in the House of Assembly. Of those eight vacancies, the Opposition, who want to come into power tomorrow, chose to contest only two. They preferred not to contest the other seats. Of course, they have not put up a candidate in Waterberg either, but I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition in this regard. After all, one does not put up two candidates in the same constituency. [Interjections.] As far as this matter is concerned, I am perfectly willing to meet any of the hon. members on it before the electorate of South Africa.</p>

<p>But now we again have the question from the hon. member for Houghton: &#x201C;Why did you not take Venter&#x2019;s passport away?&#x201D; The Department of the Interior acts on the advice of other departments in regard to passports. If they had had a request from the department responsible, namely the Department of Police, to withdraw Venter&#x2019;s passport, they would have done so.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not know. Let me just say this to the hon. member: I do not know for what reason the police did not recommend this, but the fact of the matter is that they did not recommend it. If they did not recommend it, they did so for a very good reason, although it may not be very clear to the hon. member at the moment.</p>

<p>Why did they take Agliotti&#x2019;s passport and not Venter&#x2019;s?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because Agliotti, whether by birth or origin, is a foreigner and because he was specifically implicated, I assume, the police recommended that his passport be withdrawn. But take the case of Venter. Venter cannot stay there. He must come back. He was born here. He is an Afrikaner. He has no other place to go. Surely the hon. member knows this as well as I do. But whatever the position may be, the fact remains that the police did not recommend it. I assume there is a very good reason, because I know that they do these things for good reasons, I can think of a first-class reason why they did not do so, but it is something I do not want to mention across the floor of this House now. The fact of the matter is that this case and all its implications are being investigated. All the persons concerned in it are being examined meticulously. If there is anything wrong, the guilty parties will be brought before the courts of South Africa which will pronounce judgment in that regard. Then it will be as a result of the very fact that this Government is concerned that this sort of incident should not take place.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that I have a clear conscience in regard to this matter and that the Government, after it had come to its notice, did everything that was necessary to protect the taxpayers and the public of South Africa in this regard and to promote their interests.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened, as did we all, with special attention to the contribution of the hon. the Prime Minister to this discussion. What struck me was that the Prime Minister gave one the impression that he was defending himself, his Cabinet and the Minister in question against a charge that they had committed fraud. He became very heated. He became quite inflamed that anyone could think that they would do anything verging on that. The truth is that no such charge has been made. The charge that has in fact been made, and to which the hon. the Prime Minister has not replied adequately, is that the Minister and the Cabinet were negligent in their actions in this matter. Take for example the principal defence of the hon. the Prime Minister. It was that there was no proof, nothing but presumption or suspicion that this Mr. <span class="col_9029-9030" refersTo="page_1648"/>Venter had done something wrong, although it is stated very clearly in the report that he was guilty of <i>mala fides</i> of acting in bad faith in this matter. But that is not all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But that is not a criminal offence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, but now there is something else. It is stated very clearly in the report that he was guilty of <i>mala fides.</i> The hon. the Prime Minister may say that that is not a crime. I maintain that when an official with that responsibility carries out an action involving the money of the people in a way which proves that he did so in bad faith, the people are entitled to demand more drastic, firmer and quicker action from the Government than there was in this case. Mr. Speaker, I should like to quote from the report of the commissioner. I should like to quote passages from paragraphs 234 to 238 to refresh the memory of the hon. the Prime Minister. The English text of paragraph 234 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After all these questions have been asked in regard to Mr. Agliotti. there is also a question that may be asked in regard to Mr. Venter, namely: Could it be true that Mr. Venter, the able officer who stood out on merit, who, according to the evidence, was so highly thought of by his superiors and who had rendered so many years of good service in the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure, would now go so far as to withhold so many material facts and initiate and carry out so many wrong actions simply because he liked Mr. Agliotti, or simply because, for no reason whatsoever, he wanted to relieve the Exchequer of a few million rand?</block>

<p>In paragraph 235, the commissioner gives the reply. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To all these questions there can be only one possible answer, and that is a decided &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</block>

<p>But. Sir, that is not all. In paragraph 236 he continues as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All these facts go to show, on the balance of probabilities, there must in fact have been an improper connection between Mr. Venter, the administrative control officer employed by the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land tenure, on the one hand, and Mr. Agliotti, the Managing Director of Kempton Park Brick <i>&#x0026;</i> Tile (Pty.) Ltd., on the other hand.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The Prime Minister must just give me a chance, before he makes his comment. The commissioner goes on as follows in paragraph 237&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I find this to be the biggest and the decisive factor why such a fantastic price was paid for the two properties. This is the greatest irregularity and it is now indeed clearer and easier to understand why Kempton Park Brick <i>&#x0026;</i> Tile (Pty.) Ltd., decided to repay the large sum of R4 954 692 to the State&#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he says, in paragraph 238&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question now arises whether this material misrepresentation, these irregularities, this improper connection, the <i>mala fides</i> on the part of Mr. Venter and the <i>mala fides</i> on the part of Mr. Agliotti, are not irregularities that fit in with the exposition at the beginning of this chapter, and for that reason should be referred to the Attorney-General for such action as he may deem fit.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I know, but the point I want to make, is that the commissioner was of the opinion that it had already been proved to such an extent that fraud was committed, and what is the definition of fraud? I should like to read out Gardiner <i>&#x0026;</i> Lansdown&#x2019;s definition of fraud, but before I do that, I want to remind the House of the words stated in the commission&#x2019;s report. It must be remembered that the commissioner spoke of &#x201C;material misrepresentation&#x201D;, <span class="col_9031-9032" refersTo="page_1649"/>as a result of which almost R5 million was stolen from the State. Gardiner and Lansdown say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fraud consists in unlawfully making, with intent to defraud, a misrepresentation which causes actual prejudice or which is potentially prejudicial to another.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister told us that he reported the matter to the Cabinet on the first Monday in March, but nothing was done. It was only on the following Saturday that the Prime Minister got in touch with candidates in the election.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>That is nonsense. I did not say that nothing had been done. The Prime Minister said that the matter should be brought before the Cabinet and that he would then make a decision. He said that he would be prepared to appoint a commission if he was convinced that it was necessary. *</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>But the commission was not appointed immediately. [Interjections.] No, wait a minute. The hon. the Minister is only making his case worse. After it had appeared that the land had been purchased without authorization from the Treasury, without the Minister of Mines having been consulted, as is required by the Act in question and without the Land Tenure Board, which is involved in this matter, having done its work properly, was it still necessary to make a decision so that action could be taken? The facts could have been determined immediately. The facts could have been determined before the Cabinet meeting on that Monday. I maintain that the hon. the Minister acted negligently. We have now heard, as a result of questions put by the hon. member for Durban North, that the cheque was only presented on Saturday and only paid on Monday. In other words, if the Minister had wanted to take action, he could still have stopped the payment of that cheque on Saturday. [Interjections.] Of course he could. But, Mr. Speaker, the matter was not important enough to him and to the Cabinet to disturb the tranquility of a five-day week. He could not, for once in his life, go to his office for half an hour on a Saturday to do what any private citizen would have done if he had known that a considerable amount of money which he controlled in trust for other people had been spent erroneously or apparently spent erroneously by an official in his employ. He did not take the trouble to go to his office on a Saturday morning to stop the payment of that cheque. In spite of all the replies and attempts at replies we have heard so far, no one has been able to explain Chat away. All the hon. the Minister could say is that he heard about this after 5 o'clock on Friday afternoon and could do nothing about it. In other words, he would have done something if he had heard about it before 5 o&#x2019;clock or before 3 o'clock. But he had the whole of Saturday morning. And he did nothing. But then he also told us that he tried to stop it on another occasion, but that it had by then already been paid out and that it was therefore too late. But Saturday would not have been too late; it could still have been done then. The hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister in question can talk and plead as much as they want to. there was gross negligence here. The more one ascertains what the facts are, the more shocked one is,</p>

<p>Agliotti&#x2019;s passport is cancelled. The hon. the Prime Minister tells us this was because he was not born in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think that interjection by the hon. Minister is enough to establish our case. He is still being negligent. He does not want to recognize the actual facts. If there was justification for cancelling Agliotti&#x2019;s passport, then there was the same justification for cancelling Mr. Venter&#x2019;s passport as well. For the sake of argument&#x2014;only for the sake of argument&#x2014;I concede to the hon. the Prime Minister that on the balance of probabilities a crime seems to have been committed by Agliotti, or he should at least have answered for the balance of possibilities existing here. His passport was taken away from him, but not that of this Mr. Venter. Are there then two laws in South Africa? A foreign-born person may not commit crimes, but a born South African has better opportunities to commit crimes. Or is the law identical as far as crime is concerned for these two?</p>

<p>And do you know what the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs wanted to imply in this House by way of a question?

<block name="quote">It was done in the case of Agliotti and it would certainly have been done in the case of Venter if we had reason to think that he was also in any way involved in this matter.</block>

<p>I do not think the hon. the Minister has any concept of what is going on here. I still maintain that thanks to the vigilance of the newspapers, this matter came to our attention. In this connection I give credit to the <i>Beeld</i> as well. Although they tried to condone it, I think that they felt&#x2014;as I know the <i>Beeld</i> &#x2014;that the public should know about it. That is why they published it. Thanks to the vigilance of the Press, thanks to the political sensitivity of the National Party&#x2019;s candidates, thanks to the conscientiousness of the hon. the Prime Minister, R5 million of the people&#x2019;s money was saved. But it could have been lost. The people of South Africa are entitled to ask for stricter supervision over its assets than it received from this hon. Minister and this Government. It is no use saying: After it happened, I acted with dispatch. Things like this must not happen. In any department, in any business. <span class="col_9037-9038" refersTo="page_1652"/>undertaking where strict and regular supervision is maintained in the interests of the shareholders&#x2019; money or trust money that undertaking is handling, no subordinate would dare do a thing like this. No subordinate would dare to do that if he knows that he will be asked regularly and frequently to give an account of the money he is spending. This did not happen in this case. The people do not merely want to know that the stable door will he dosed only when the horse has fled. The people will want to know what precautions are being taken to ensure that unauthorized people do not gain access to that stable and get hold of the horse. No, we are dealing here with a Government which has, administratively, become lax and lazy and complacent. They are neglecting the interests of the people, in the numerous respects my hon. Leader mentioned today in the second part of his speech. As far as housing is concerned, as far as the cost of living is concerned, as far as transport and education is concerned, the Government is neglecting the interests of the people. It is lax and indifferent as far as control over the money of the people is concerned. It does not care what happens to that money. Its only defence is: &#x201D; I was not guilty of a crime, and when I discovered what was going on, I took action.&#x201D; We are still waiting to hear what steps were taken in the past to ensure that the powers delegated by Ministers were exercised properly and under supervision. We have not yet received any reply. Laxity! Slackness! Indifference! It seems to us the Government is saying: &#x201C;We who are the National party Government will govern forever.&#x201D; The hon. the Prime Minister again tried to allege that today. &#x201C;We no longer have to answer to the people&#x201D; &#x2014;that is the whole attitude and the failure of the Government They are arrogant.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I repeat it. The hon. the Prime Minister with much verbosity derided us for not nominating candidates in safe Nationalist Party constituencies. He said that he would meet us wherever we liked. He implied that we would not come into power because we are not fit to do so. I cannot understand why the hon. the Prime Minister is so sensitive that he cannot stand by his own words and his own attitude. But I prefer to say that that attitude which gave the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s game away today, lies at the root of the incompetence and the laxity of the Government. I repeat it. They feel that they no longer have to answer to the people. They feel that through the exploitation of prejudice and with the exploitation of attitudes on colour with which they came into power, they will remain in power. The people are suffering as a result of this. Efficient government is suffering as a result of this. As long as that is their attitude, the one Agliotti affair after the other, the one fish scandal after the other, will occur in South Africa. Unless the hon. the Prime Minister does what he promised to do after the election, which is to shake up his administration&#x2014;and there have been no signs of this&#x2014;these things will continue. We demand that this be done. We demand that the hon. Minister whose negligence, whose indifference, whose laxity these things have disclosed, leave the Cabinet and convince <span class="col_9039-9040" refersTo="page_1653"/>the people that the standards which South Africa sets for the administration of its affairs, are high and will remain high.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: The hon. member for Yeoville, and a large number of speakers before him, asked with great impetuosity why they could not obtain a reply to the question of why payment of the cheque, issued by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, was not stopped. Sir, on what good authority do they make such a request to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, because what are the facts? Before the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is a matter involving the cashing of a cheque. At that stage he only suspected that the price could be excessively high for the land, but on the evidence of his officials, senior, officials, and on the evidence of a reasonably authoritative report before him about the mineral value of that land, the hon. the Minister could well have accepted the validity of the price. For what good reason should he have, and could he have, given a decision, within the space of an hour, to the effect that that land had been purchased at too high a price and that he should immediately stop payment of the cheque? He had no authority to have dared do it&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S.</person>:</from>

<p>But he says he wanted to.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: Imagine, Sir, what would have happened if the hon. the Minister had given instructions that payment of that cheque be stopped, if it was Stopped in time and if Mr. Agliotti then instituted proceedings, proving that that land was worth much more than the price for which we purchased it; if he were to have regarded our actions as breach of contract; if he then refused to sell the land and we then had to buy it at twice the price. What would the hon. members then have said about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s actions? They would then have said that he was some kind of tyrant who was trying to run his department accordingly. But, Sir, I leave this question at that, because I cannot see on what good authority hon. members on that side can insist that the Minister should have stopped payment of the cheque and that he could have made such a decision within the space of an hour. He was not able to do so, not on the strength of the evidence he had before him.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>But he said that he wanted to do so.</p>

<p>&#x2022;Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: It does not matter what the Minister said.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to claim that there were no irregularities on the part of the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. Possibly a gross irregularity was perpetrated. If that is so&#x2014;and according to this commission of inquiry that is probably the case&#x2014;no one on this side of the House will try to excuse the actions of those officials, and no one has tried to do so. If that is so, then I believe that the rightful punishment should be meted out to them, and this the courts will probably do when they are found guilty, but that is only when they are found guilty, and this is very important, Mr. Speaker. But what we cannot do&#x2014;and a responsible Opposition that is acquainted with the principles of public administration ought not to do so either&#x2014;is to besmirch the hon. the Minister of Agriculture in connection with this matter. What is more. Sir, the Opposition and the English-language Press demand the resignation of the hon. the Minister in connection with this transaction, as if he is personally implicated in a crime.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>But he is responsible for it.</p>

<p>&#x2022;Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: In this conduct on the part of the Opposition and the English language Press they do not even recognize the most elementary principle of public administration, let alone decency, or must one ascribe this conduct, on the part of the Opposition and the English language Press, to the fact that they have no knowledge of the principles of public administration. and that neither do they realize that most of the problems experienced in public administration every day throughout the world, concern the human element or factor which one cannot control or predict in advance?</p>

<p>There is such a thing as integrity and a sense of responsibility which the administrator of any organization must, of necessity, rely on, and these characteristics of integrity, and a sense of judgment and responsibility, the administrator of any organization cannot possibly pre-determine as far as his staff is concerned. He is simply not able to do so. This inability, which is recognized throughout the world, has already given rise to thousands of cases of <span class="col_9041-9042" refersTo="page_1654"/>fraud in the world&#x2019;s history. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture would have been a superhuman being if he were able to gauge these characteristics of his staff correctly, and accordingly determine whether an irregularity would be committed or not. But instead of displaying a realistic attitude and political integrity towards the hon. the Minister in connection with this case, the English press and the Opposition, as is their custom, chose to play the role of political snipers. They did not try to determine what principles, as far as the Ministers relationship to this situation is concerned, were relevant, and then formulate their criticism accordingly. No, they just want to scavenge on fetid political scraps, and in the process they do not care what established and recognized principles they are violating.</p>

<p>The relevant principle here is the delegation of powers, a necessary and indispensible element in any organization&#x2019;s administration. There is, of course, a great measure of risk involved in the delegation of powers. It is also a recognized fact that this risk, which is involved in the delegation of powers, cannot in practice be measured in advance, because the great problem involved here, is that the abuse of the delegation of power can only be determined after an irregularity has been perpetrated. That is inevitable; there is no way of pre-determining this. It is quite correct that the administrator, of course, accepts the fact that something can go wrong when he delegates his powers, because something may be wrong with the judgment, the integrity and the sense of responsibility of those to whom he dele- gales his powers. But one cannot blame him for that. He is not co-responsible if such a thing happens. But&#x2014;and this is important&#x2014;he does accept liability for the deed&#x2014;that is correct&#x2014;but then only for its correction, as far as this is administratively possible. But one cannot blame him for the deed itself, unless he is an accessory.</p>

<p>I want to give you an example. Sir. an everyday example. The board of directors of a newspaper is responsible for the reports appearing in that newspaper, but the task of writing those articles is entrusted to or delegated to the journalists. It has happened before that, as a result of a lack of judgment or a sense of responsibility, articles have appeared in the newspapers that cost those newspapers thousands and thousands of rand in libel cases and claims. But would you blame the chairman of the board of directors for it? Of course not, because although he accepts liability, he was not responsible for the deed itself. And who would slander him because his newspaper lost a great deal of money as a result of a claim for libel, who would think he was a bad chairman, or who would consequently demand his resignation? He may perhaps be the most competent chairman that board of directors has ever had.</p>

<p>In speaking of journalists, I am referring. of course, to the recent reports which I think are still giving the Opposition cold shivers, i.e. when journalists, with calm deliberation, completely discredited the Opposition, particularly the hon. the Leader, on the strength of the poor display against the hon. the Prime Minister when his Vote was under discussion here in the House of Assembly. The English Press has not written so effectively about the truth for a long time, except that they made a mistake in thinking that they were discrediting the Opposition, because there is nothing to discredit. Their poor display against the hon. the Prime Minister is their normal one; we see it every day. The only thing they excel in is the creation of gossip and suspicion, and this also with respect to the integrity and the competence of the leaders and the Ministers in this House of Assembly.</p>

<p>However, I should now like to come back to the principle involved in this case, and also to the sordid attacks by the English Press and the Opposition on the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. More specifically I also want to come back to the principle that we find in the delegation of powers, and the concomitant responsibilities, in any organization. The Opposition did not come along and attack this principle of the delegation of powers&#x2014;a previous speaker has also mentioned the fact. They would have appeared ridiculous had they done so. But neither did they admit, and this is very important, that there is a great deal of risk attached to the delegation of powers. Had they done so they would have had to be honest with themselves and with the public at large. However, they are no longer able to be honest with themselves and with the public. True to their traditions, they immediately began to gossip and create suspicion about the competence and the integrity of the hon. <span class="col_9043-9044" refersTo="page_1655"/>the Minister of Agriculture. If they do not attack the principle of the delegation of powers, they must admit that there is a great deal of risk involved. If they were to do this, they would have to stop slandering the hon. the Minister of Agriculture as if he shared in the liability and responsibility for the commission of an irregularity.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course he does.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: Is the hon. member saying that he shares liability and responsibility for the deed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He is responsible for his department.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: My words were that they must stop slandering him as if he shares in the responsibility for the commission of an irregularity, and the hon. member said that he does. If that is the case, hon. members opposite must tell us what they think of the hon. the Minister. They must tell us that they think that he personally shares in the responsibility for the commission of that deed. They must tell us frankly, however.</p>

<p>As soon as powers and responsibilities are delegated, it can validly be expected that the person to whom those powers are delegated, will consult his superior as soon as he is faced with a situation which falls beyond the scope of the powers delegated to him. If he does not do so, this surely does not mean that the person in charge was lax, incompetent or negligent. After all, blame for maladministration and misspending cannot be attached to a Minister if an official is guilty of an irregularity and does not bring a matter to the Minister&#x2019;s attention through the normal channels. If this happens it means, at most, that an official or an employee was guilty of an irregularity for some reason or other. The reason could be ignorance or incompetence. It could also be over-zealousness or neglect of duty, and it could also mean dishonesty or fraud, This report, however, also very expressly recognizes the fact that there is a risk attached to the delegation of powers. I should like to quote from paragraph 101. The Commissioner states&#x2014; I</p>

<block name="quote">I find that this failure to refer the matter to higher authority, together with the known facts which were all to hand on the file, to be a gross irregularity on the part of Mr. Venter.</block>

<p>He expressly states that this person neglected his duties by not bringing this matter to the attention of his employer or his chief. In paragraph 115 the Commissioner states further that the result of neglecting to consult his chief was that the State had to pay out millions of rands on the strength of delegated authority that was exercised precipitately and without further independent investigation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the point &#x2014;precipitately.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: The hon. member says &#x201C;that is the point&#x201D;. I agree with him. The fact that a person, to whom powers are delegated, takes a matter of this scope into his own hands, for whatever reason, is the point. As an employee he should have consulted the hon. the Minister, or whoever the case may be. He did not do so. Now we surely cannot blame the Minister for that,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: On what grounds? The hon. member says &#x201C;of course&#x201D;. How can we blame the Minister? I gave him an example of what happens every day in practice. The hon. member claims that the Minister can be blamed. Well, he accepts liability, as I have said, for the actions of his department. I agree with that. But there is quite a difference between liability and responsibility. The Minister accepts liability for restoring the situation, as far as this is administratively possible, but not for the deed itself. After all, he did not commit it. He was not an accessory. How can we now claim that the hon. the Minister is responsible? He is liable&#x2014;quite correct&#x2014;but not responsible. I now leave this matter at that.</p>

<p>In the short time I still have at my disposal. I want to touch on three general matters. I am sorry that these hon. members are not here. I should, firstly, like to refer to the remarks and behaviour of a lot of boisterous back benchers on that side of the House. I want to refer, in particular. to a remark that was made in this House last week by an hon. member, when another hon. member on this side asked, on a point of order, whether an improper <span class="col_9045-9046" refersTo="page_1656"/>remark was permissible. I want to state this case for three reasons. It is an indication to me of a lack of party discipline, but that is their affair. But, as far as I am concerned, it is also an indication of a lack of respect for the dignity of this House. Thirdly, I saw in the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday that under a banner headline they give recognition to the hon. member&#x2019;s &#x201D; contribution&#x201D; in that relevant debate, as if this were a tremendous achievement. Sir, I now want you to know what the achievement was, because according to the <i>Sunday Times</i> he made a big contribution in the debate about the shareholdings of Ministers. His &#x201C;contribution&#x201D; was an improper interjection, which he was too ashamed to repeat, and which would not have been permissible. That was his contribution to that debate. Then the <i>Sunday Times</i> gives strong recognition to the participation of the hon. member for Florida in the debate about the shareholdings of Ministers. But that was not the only incident. Today, again, an hon. member has to stand up here before me and ask you please to maintain order amongst these hon. members. All they came here to do was to sit and make a noise. One really gains that impression, here where we are sitting amongst them at the hack. I should like the hon. member for Florida&#x2019;s voters to note this deplorable contribution which he made to that debate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there is another matter to which I briefly want to refer. I have already done so in passing. This matter concerns the thrashing the Opposition received this year at the hands of the English Press and that after the Prime Minister had warned them this Session that those same newspapers which lauded them last year after the general election would, in due course, destroy them. That process has begun. If one looks at what the newspapers had to say about that poor display, one finds the following statement, for example, in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One really begins to despair of the</block>

<p>United Party.</p>

<p>What a desolate statement to make, i.e. that you despair of the party to which you cling. They go further and state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Prime Minister's vote could have been exactly what the United Party wanted to kindle the public&#x2019;s belief in it as an alternative Government.</block>

<p>In other words, even the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> acknowledges that the public has never seen that party as an alternative Government. That is why that newspaper said that it was an opportunity the United Party could have used to kindle the public's belief in them as a party which could compose a Government. Sir, what a sorrowful phenomenon this is for people sitting in this House!</p>

<p>The last statement to which I want to refer, Sir, reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For four days the United Party droned on incessantly.</block>

<p>We still find, Sir, that these people are at their most brilliant when they are indulging in virulent, dirty attacks and gossip. When one policy or standpoint must be matched up against another policy or standpoint, or when they are challenged to answer &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201D; no&#x201D; to a question&#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>For example?</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;:&#x2026; then they are silent. Hansard is teeming with such examples. Sir, they will also keep silent in future, but the people of South Africa believe in the National Party as the party that will rule this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stretcher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STRETCHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should very much have liked to reply to the hon. member for Odendaalsrus, because normally he makes a contribution to which everyone can listen, but today I must state that the hon. member said very little to which a person could react without some difficulty. The hon. member says that we cannot blame the hon. the Minister of Agriculture for what happened in the Agliotti case. He says the hon. the Minister is accountable for what is done in his department, but that he cannot be held responsible for what is done here.</p>

<p>*Dr. W. D. KOTZ&#x00C9;: I said that he is not responsible for the deed itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. That statement which the hon. member makes obviously sounds logical, but if the hon. member&#x2019;s statement is analyzed, it simply <span class="col_9047-9048" refersTo="page_1657"/>means that no Minister can be held responsible for anything that goes wrong in his department, because then it could simply be said that the deed had been carried out by an official and that the Minister is accountable, but not responsible for it. If the hon. member&#x2019;s statement is analyzed, it means that the entire Parliament as such and the country&#x2019;s administration become a farce, that is to say, if the hon. the Minister is not prepared to accept responsibility for what takes place in his department. The hon. member for Odendaalsrus is definitely right about the Minister of Agriculture. I want to indicate as much to this House this afternoon. For as long as he has been Minister of Agriculture, this hon. Minister has never accepted responsibility for anything. He has never accepted responsibility for his policy or lack of agricultural policy in South Africa. Nowhere has he ever accented responsibility. When the hon. the Minister stood up here today, adopting that attitude of his, it did not surprise me in the least. This is how we have come to know him over a period of 13 years during which he has been head of this department. His attitude has always been to try to argue his way out of a matter. Eventually the agricultural industry of South Africa stands alone while the hon. the Minister laughs up his sleeve and says: &#x201C;Now I have shown you a thing or two.&#x201D; That is the attitude the hon. the Minister has always adopted. This afternon I am just going to prove it with a few examples.</p>

<p>But before I come to that. I also want to mention a few aspects of the Agliotti case. I think that there is a question that ought to be asked under the circumstances. Why is Mr. Venter now enjoying a vacation overseas and an apparently well-earned rest? I should like to know whether the hon. the Minister, or any other responsible Minister, who is prepared to accept responsibility, sent Venter a cable to say that his leave had been cancelled and that he should return to South Africa immediately. Such questions are of great importance under the circumstances. The hon. gentlemen have now tried to escape the fact that a passport was granted to him. Mr. Agliotti&#x2019;s was refused, it is true, but Mr. Venter was given one. The hon. the Minister, or any hon. member who speaks after he does, can give us a reply to this.</p>

<p>Then there is another question I want to ask. Today the hon. the Minister said that he and Mr. Hendrik Schoeman. the Deputy Minister, held discussions with Dr. Henning, the chairman of the Land Tenure Board. These discussions took place on the Wednesday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<p>Friday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, on Friday, 6th March. Dr. Henning then told them that when the Board had convened on the Wednesday, a case had come before them showing how expensive land in South Africa had become, and that they had to approve R6,3 million for that project. Then the hon. the Minister told us that he had told Dr. Henning that he would like to take the case to the Cabinet. He immediately requested the relevant documents. Those are the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s words as I wrote them down.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I then told Mr. Viljoen to come along.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stretcher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STRETCHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Mr. Viljoen had to come along and give him the documents. Dr. Henning told the hon. the Minister that they had to pray R6,3 million. I now want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he could then immediately see, when the documents of Mr. Viljoen were put before him. that there was a big difference between R6,3 million and R7,5 million, which was to be paid out by the department? When the hon. the Minister saw the considerate difference which Dr. Henning had mentioned, was it then not absolutely necessary for the hon. the Minister, as the hon. member for Yeoville has said, to have taken all possible steps to stop that payment? I think that the fact that there was a considerable increase from the R6,3 million, which Dr. Henning told him about, to the almost R7,5 million, which was paid out, was another reason why the hon. the Minister should have taken immediate action.</p>

<p>There is a second question I should like to ask. In the report on page 31, paragraph 155, in the cross-examination of Mr. Vilioen by this commission, a member of Parliament&#x2019;s name was mentioned, i.e. that of Mr. Van der Merwe, M.P. of Meyerton.</p>

<p>Yes, I find it strange that in the report they use the <span class="col_9049-9050" refersTo="page_1658"/>name &#x201C;Mr. Van der Merwe, M.P., of Meyerton&#x201D;, but that no mention is made of his constituency or his initials.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I found it necessary to consult the list of the names of the M.P.&#x2019;s and to determine which Van der Merwe this was by means of the addresses. It appears to be Mr. Willem Lodewikus van der Merwe, 61, Rietfontein, Meyerton. who is the M.P. for Heidelberg. The hon. member is sitting here in the House, and I should like to know what role he played in this. Apparently the report is not quite clear. The hon. member for Heidelberg ought to tell us what it is all about. According to what the commissioner says in the report, Mr. Viljoen endorsed certain of Mr. Van der Merwe&#x2019;s correspondence, i.e. &#x201C;Hier is iemand wat met ons saamstem&#x201D;. In paragraph 156 I read the following&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">In the letter of 15 March 1970, referred to above, Mr. Van der Merwe wrote the following, <i>inter alia</i>, to the Honourable the Minister, Mr. Schoeman:<br/>Dit lyk dus vir my asof Agliotti nie eers gekry het wat sy eiendom werd is nie.</block>

<p>I am entitled to say that I think that the hon. member for Heidelberg implied that Mr. Agliotti was paid too little for this land? In other words, is it actually wrong of Mr. Agliotti to have repaid almost R5 million to the South African Government &#x201C;as a public-spirited gesture&#x201D;? This matter is not quite clear to me in this report. It appears to me as if there is one certain M.P. who at that stage thought that Mr. Agliotti was not paid enough for his land.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North pointed out that there are certain matters that are not dear, In this connection we do not have the evidence. The report was drawn up, and paragraph 156 is an important paragraph, in which a portion of the hon. member&#x2019;s letter to Mr. Hendrik Schoeman, the Deputy Minister, is recorded. I think the hon. member for Heidelberg owes this House a reply. He must tell us why he wrote: &#x201C;Dit lyk dus vir my asof Agliotti nie eers gekry het wat sy eiendom werd is nie&#x201D;. The State does not want to do anyone down. Neither do I think that this Parliament wants to do anyone down. If Mr. Agliotti was paid too little, if his land is worth much more, I think it only right that someone should tell us that the report is wrong and that Mr. Agliotti should actually have been paid more for that land.</p>

<p>But I said that I would come back to the hon. the Minister. I want to say why I think that the hon. gentleman never accepts responsibility for anything.</p>

Under this hon. gentleman&#x2019;s guidance more fanners have left the platteland of South Africa in the past 13 years than ever before in South Africa&#x2019;s agricultural history. Under the guidance of this hon. Minister, as Minister of Agriculture, a price policy was pursued which forced more farmers out of their farming than it enticed into the farming industry. Under the guidance of this hon. Minister the farmers&#x2019; burdens of debt increased as never before. But when it was pointed out to him that the debts of farmers had increased considerably, that they amounted to about R1 300 million, it was this same hon. Minister who said that we should nevertheless remember that all their debts were not specifically agricultural debts. Now that the South African farmers are in difficulties, it is this same hon. Minister who claims that a great deal of that debt is to be ascribed to the fact that they have beach cottages, boats and special light trucks with which to tow those boats. It was this same hon. Minister, together with his former colleague. who a few years ago told fanners that they were in that position because had built houses on their farms that we too expensive. It is the same hon. Minister who stood up in this House and told us that he personally had a much better meat scheme than the one being applied in <span class="col_9051-9052" refersTo="page_1659"/>South Africa today. When we asked him why, if he had such a better meat scheme, he did not apply it, he said: &#x201C;No, the farmers of South Africa, organized agriculture, want the present scheme and therefore I am not prepared to change it&#x201D;. When last October I sent him a &#x201C;reply paid&#x201D; telegram, asking whether they were going to increase the price of bread, it is that same hon. Minister who replied to me that the Cabinet had not yet decided upon the increase in the price of bread.</p>

<p>&#x2022;Mr. H. VAN Z. CILLI&#x00C9;: Before the provincial election?</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was just before the provincial election. On 1st January of this year this hon. Minister, in his wisdom, decided that he was not going to increase the subsidy on bread, but that he would rather increase the price of bread for the consumer in South Africa. When for years, with the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District as spokesman, we advocated to him that changes must be forthcoming with a view to encouraging our dairy farmers to produce more milk, butter and cheese in South Africa, because we would soon be faced with a shortage of these commodities, this fell on deaf ears. But this is the hon. the Minister who is today responsible for this mess we have today in our butter situation in South Africa. When these questions about butter were put to the hon. the Minister he said: &#x201C;Just keep a stout heart, the ship is coming one of these days and then we will no longer have a butter shortage in South Africa&#x201D;. Sir, this is same Minister who is at the moment making nearly R3 million profit on the importation of butter. This is the same Minister who is responsible for the fact that butter for the South African housewife has increased to a price as high as 54 cents per 500 grams for 49 cents per lb.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Why should I make such an irresponsible suggestion? Sir, the only thing that we on this side want is this: We do not want the cost of living to increase as it is now doing. A while ago the hon. the Minister of Finance said that we would have considerable increases in the cost of living in the first half of the year, and how right he was! But, Sir, is it going to end after these first six months? I think we can continue to expect the cost of living to increase further in the next six months, and that hon. Minister of Agriculture is responsible for it as a result of the attitude he adopts. The result is that the hon. gentleman has to import butter today, and this has happened before, because there was a lack of planning and, in the second instance, because they do not listen in good time to the warnings given them by the dairy farmers and by organized agriculture in this country. Because you see, Mr. Speaker, at a time when they should have reduced prices, only one thing happened, and that was that more and more dairy farmers were not prepared to produce at that price. That was the reason why farmers were forced out; that is why they sold some of their herds; and that is why they are today trying to find every conceivable reason for the butter shortage in South Africa except that relating to the lack of a price policy on the part of the South African Government. If they had followed the correct price policy, it would not have been necessary for South Africa to have this butter shortage today.</p>

</speech>

<p>What of the production costs?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly. Production costs have increased and because they have increased, the Minister ought to have helped the farmer. But when he did not do so, there was only one thing for die South African dairy farmer to do, and that was to leave the farming industry. That is why our local production of butter is not increasing. In 1969 our local production was 122 million lbs. In 1970, last year, the production was only 104 million lbs. There was consequently a considerable decrease of almost 15 per cent in our butter production in one year, and it is expected that in this dairy year, 1971, our production will be only about 95 million lbs., a further decrease of about 8,6 per cent in comparison with 1970. If the Minister had taken these facts into consideration, as the dairy farmers warned him to do, he would have given timely encouragement and South Africa would not have been faced with this present-day butter shortage. If he had been at all worried about the ordinary man in the street, if he had been at all worried about the housewife who is today struggling to make ends meet, he would have been prepared to advocate to the Government that the subsidy on butter be increased.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister this question. Did he think the only way of saving the situation would be to increase the price of butter?</p>

<p>Where must he get the money?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Now I have the answer. The request was not made, because if it had been made the question about where the money must be found would have been asked. Consequently there is only one way to put things right, and that is to make demands on the consumer. You would not have had that kind of thing under a United Party rule, because we would have ensured that the farmer got his rightful share. When there is an increase in production costs, he would have had an increase in price. But one cannot allow the consumer to pay this considerable increase in the price. That is why this side would have found the solution in ensuring that the money was obtained from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</p>

<p>Just to get the hon. the Minister out of trouble, that money that Agliotti paid back could have been used to subsidize the price of butter, and then we would have had no further problems. Thus, for the hon. the <span class="col_9055-9056" refersTo="page_1661"/>Minister to ask where the money would come from, is nonsense. He surely still has a certain amount of money in the Stabilization Fund. It has surely not all been used up by the Minister of Finance. But when this Government is in trouble, there is only one way out, and that is to ask the consumer and the taxpayer to pay their share to balance the Government&#x2019;s finances. We say that the Government will not be successful with this policy, and that the South African taxpayers and consumers will only become more dissatisfied, until they are relieved of this Government and the United Party comes into power.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, today I am very grateful for two things. Strangely enough I owe the hon. member for Newton Park a debt of gratitude because he has given me the opportunity to speak and put forward a matter that I should like to put forward. Since I have not yet been a Member of Parliament for five years, but have been in public life for a long time, I am secondly grateful this afternoon for the fact that it has always been a golden rule, as far as I am concerned, that when I do, say or write anything, I do so in such a way that I shall also be prepared to make my words or actions public, as I am now being given the opportunity to do, without the need to keep anything back.</p>

<p>Because the Opposition is dealing with an honest and courageous Government, they have this opportunity this afternoon of conducting this debate. I am sincerely convinced that if the hon. the Prime Minister and the action begun by the Nationalists, by the hon. member for Boksburg, had not given rise to the appointment of a commission of inquiry by the Prime Minister, the Agliotti case would long ago have been forgotten. I am speaking today as someone who has been in the brick industry for many years. This is an industry that I know and a subject I see my way clear to debating with any hon. member opposite. If the hon. the Prime Minister had not appointed that commission of inquiry, people throughout South Africa, who have the necessary knowledge of clay and the manufacturing of clay products, as I do, would have accepted what was written in the newspapers, i.e. that that property had rich clay deposits. The other 99 per cent of the public would have argued that they knew nothing about the subject, and they would have argued that experts had carried out the valuation. They would then have accepted the situation as such. It is for this reason that I say with great certainty that by taking this step the Prime Minister certainly foresaw that it could perhaps involve inconvenience for him in the future, as was apparent this afternoon. He knew that if the commission's findings were those they actually gave, he, his Government and the Minister would have to answer for it. I want to repeat that if he had not appointed the commission, this case would have been forgotten long ago, and no one would have been the wiser.</p>

<p>I want to acknowledge this afternoon that it is an unfortunate case. It is a case that all of us would probably not have wanted, if we had a choice in the matter. However, I want to say in all reasonableness this afternoon that I cannot place the blame for it at the door of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. I also had a look at this report. It shows me two deviations from the norm by an official or officials. Normally in such a case, where minerals or subterranean riches are involved, the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure requests a valuation of that land by the Department of Mines. In other words, a valuation is done by people who have a knowledge of minerals. However, this was not done. The second big shortcoming, in my opinion, is the fact that the official did not refer this case to the Treasury either, which is normally also done. I choose to believe that if these two steps had been taken, or if only one of them had been taken, we would not have had this case before us this afternoon.</p>

<p>I now also want to say a few words about part played by the National Party&#x2019;s in this matter as it developed. I also played a part. On 14th March, 1970, I attended the conference of National Party candidates in Pretoria where our colleague, the hon. member for Boksburg, broached this matter. I now want to be very honest with you this afternoon. I know that some of my colleagues would perhaps not like it if I say this, but I want to do so. I am an honest man. That is why I do not hesitate to say it. If one has worked over the years with something which has brought one prosperity, one develops a respect and a love for it. While the matter was under discussion I felt that morning, because I have a knowledge of clay, that the people who were speaking did not all realize the possible <span class="col_9057-9058" refersTo="page_1662"/>value of clay. I would have liked to take part in the discussion, but I did not get the opportunity. I then drove back to my constituency, because that afternoon I had a church function that I had to attend. After the church function I had to attend a school function. That evening I did not get the opportunity to do what I should have liked to do either. I say again: I did this because I realized the value of good clay, regardless of whose clay it is. If Sir de Villiers Graaff or anyone at all were to tell me this afternoon that he suspected that he had valuable clay on his property, it would stimulate my interest, and I would immediately be prepared to go and have a look and pass a judgment. I was not concerned with whose clay it was, but with the possible worth of valuable clay, such as that discussed at the time. Early Sunday morning I therefore did what I wanted to do on Saturday evening. I picked up my telephone and phoned Deputy Minister Schoeman at his farm, I told him that if there was valuable clay on the property, there was a big possibility that too much had not been paid for the property. Perhaps even ton little had been paid if it were good, valuable clay. I then told him that in a short memorandum I wanted to slate in writing what the value of clay could be. I then did so.</p>

<p>The following evening, Monday evening, there was a further development. The hon. the Prime Minister was addressing an election meeting at Springs, Before the meeting the hon. the Prime Minister, Mr. Jack Steyl and I held a discussion. There was a quick review of the Agliotti matter. I gave the hon. the Prime Minister my opinion of the affair. At the time the hon. the Prime Minister mentioned two very important facts, which I should like to have recorded. He said feat the commission would be appointed. If it appeared that there had been irregularities he, the Prime Minister, would take action and immediately invalidate the entire transaction. We place this to fee credit of the Prime Minister. In the second place the Prime Minister said something that delighted me. He said that if it were found that there was good clay on the property, the airport would have to make other plans, because then it would not be a good thing for South Africa to bury this under an airport. I confirmed this and agreed with the hon. the Prime Minister. That night, when I returned home, I felt that I should write fee hon. fee Prime Minister a short letter, because he and I had discussed fee matter and I wanted to convey more of my views to him. I said in that letter that I was enclosing a copy of the memorandum which I had sent to Deputy Minister Schoeman. I wrote to him as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hereby attach a copy of a letter to the hon. H. Schoeman. It may perhaps be of some value to you. All my calculations, except the tonnage per morgen, are conservative and calculated on a minimum basis.</block>

<p>The tonnage I could more or less calculate exactly.</p>

<p>Sir, for the sake of interest I should like to just tell you and fee hon. House something in passing. Looking at this council chamber, and I would estimate it to be 25 years in length, 20 yards in width and 20 yards in depth, I calculate a capacity of 10 000 tons. 10 000 tons can be extracted from a mine as large as this council chamber, and if it is a reasonable type of clay, suitable for face bricks, such a mine would yield at least R10 000. I continued by writing fee following to the Prime Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition my statement that Agliotti had perhaps not even been justly compensated, rests on the supposition that a large area of the property contains good clay. If not, my arguments, of course, fall away.</block>

<p>I now want to read to you what I wrote, <i>inter alia</i>, to the hon. Deputy Minister Schoeman. The letter to him is dated 15th March, 1970, and it was written early in the morning on which the report appeared in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> My letter to the Deputy Minister reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Hendrik,</block>

<block name="quote">I am writing this short letter in connection with yesterday&#x2019;s discussion about Agliotti. As a person who has, among other things, made a living out of clay, i.e. in the manufacturing of bricks, I am of fee few people who perhaps have a knowledge of the value of clay.</block>

<p>I do not want to bore fee House with this, but I went on to explain and I had made a calculation of what the yield would be from a morgen of a poor type of brick day 10 feet thick would be. and what its <span class="col_9059-9060" refersTo="page_1663"/>monetary value could be, in terms of the raw product and a processed product in the form of bricks. In the second place I also made a calculation of what the yield would be in the case of a morgen of good clay, suitable for face bricks and, thirdly, what the yield would be from a morgen of very good clay, suitable for ceramics. I emphasize again that my calculations were based on the supposition that the property had good clay deposits, and after I had made this calculation, I concluded with these words which appear in the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears to me therefore, that Agliotti did not even get what his property is worth. It is also a pity that that valuable clay should forever be buried under an airport as a result of unavoidable circumstances. Countries such as China, England, Scotland and others have through the years earned hundreds of millions of rand with ceramic products.</block>

<p>Sir. at the time that was my view and my conviction, and it was based on the supposition that there was valuable clay on the property. Today this is no longer my view, because no one ought to know better than Mr. Agliotti whether there is clay on his property or not. I want to say this afternoon that Mr. Agliotti knew that there was no clay of that kind on his property. Why do I say this? I say this because he gave back that R5 million. If he had been convinced of the fact that there was valuable clay on his property, he would not have paid back that money. Had I been in his position, I would not have done it, because I would have known that if assessors were to be appointed as, I believe, they would have been appointed, they would have been able to furnish the necessary proof of what the value of the clay and of the land was. He knows his own property, and I believe that he knew that the clay, which he professed was there, was not present on his property, and that is why he paid back the R5 million. I say again that this was my view at the time. It is no longer my view today. It would have been another matter if the clay had been there. But I do not believe that there is clay there. He admitted as much himself. and that is why he paid back the money. I thank the National Party, my colleague for Boksburg and in particular the hon. the Prime Minister for having taken the courageous step for the sake of South Africa, and having run this risk in the full knowledge that it could bring possible criticism and scorn raining down upon him. He saved the South African taxpayer R5 million.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the arguments of the hon. member for Heidelberg are really very difficult to follow. He is, he claims, an expert in clay and this we readily accept. We accept that he is a day expert and we listened with great interest to his explanation of what the clay might have been worth if it had been there. He started off, when the whole matter was first being discussed, on the assumption that there was clay and that if it was there it was of a certain value. He was even prepared to go so far as to say that if his assumptions were correct, then Agliotti was getting at least as much as he deserved. He is now prepared to deduce <i>ex post facto</i>, because Agliotti felt obliged to refund a certain amount of money to the State, that in fact the clay could not have been there, that the original assumption was incorrect and that the Nationalist Party therefore comes out of this affair with flying colours. This is an absolutely brilliant argument. It does not affect the case at all.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to one further point. It has been averred by that hon. member and by one or two other hon. members that because an inquiry was instituted into this question of clay, this gave rise to a new valuation or a corrected valuation being made which in fact led to the whole case being thrown open. Therefore, it was those who instituted the late inquiry who actually managed to save the State some of this money.</p>

<p>This I think does poor justice to the watchdog of our public finances. We have a Controller and Auditor-General who is to be commended for the vigilance which <span class="col_9061-9062" refersTo="page_1664"/>he exercises in the control of our public accounts. If hon. members would look at the report of the Controller and Auditor- General for l969-'70, they will find on page 417 a reference by the Controller and Auditor-General to the effect that an irregular payment was made. He draws attention in this report to the fact that a cheque was irregularly issued for an amount of approximately R7&#x00BD; million. He referred to this amount as an unauthorized payment. He says that the Department of Land Tenure then applied to the Treasury for <i>ex post facto</i> authority to make this payment good. This request was refused. It was only after the whole matter had been sorted out and a refund had been made that Treasury then gave <i>ex post facto</i> approval for the payment of the R2&#x00BD; million to which the purchase price had by then been reduced.</p>

<p>To allege that it was the vigilance of the Government which led to the exposure of this scandal is absolute nonsense. It is the duty of the Controller and Auditor- General to supervise the finances of the Government departments and even if the Government had not stirred a finger I am confident that the Controller and Auditor- General would have duly brought it to the notice of Parliament and the whole thing would have been blown wide open anyway.</p>

<p>I now come to the speech of the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. I should perhaps start my remarks by saying that the nature of the argument conducted by members on that side of the House is rather extraordinary. They take the view that because they took quick remedies and did the best they could to repair the damage as quickly as possible, they therefore have no responsibility whatsoever for the damage done. This is rather like my saving that that member over there is a negligent driver; that he drives negligently, has accidents and causes a great deal of damage all around him; but in his favour one must say that, the accident having been caused, he is very quick to come to the aid of the injured. He is a good man for repairs. Arguing along these lines, the hon. member for Odendaalsrus has in fact praised the actions of the Government in relation to this affair. He cannot see, therefore, that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture really has any responsibility at all for what happened.</p>

<p>I would like to trace some of the hon. the Minister's responsibilities. It so happens that normally appointments of heads of departments are done on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission. In the case of the appointment of the head of the Department of Land Tenure, although the Public Service Commission duly submitted a very strongly motivated report for the appointment of a Mr. Steyn, who had in fact been earmarked for that job, this was overridden by the Cabinet. The report of the Public Service Commission for 1969 says on page 9, paragraph 81&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the time when he approached the Commission in connection with a possible successor to Mr. Sevenster, the Honourable the Minister of Agriculture could not have known that Mr. Sevenster would subsequently decide to retire&#x2026;</block>

<p>And so on. He therefore intervened. Then the report goes on&#x2014;and this is a pregnant sentence&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">It was intimated on various occasions that Mr. Viljoen was regarded as the most suitable candidate for the post and that the Cabinet also held this view.</block>

<p>I repeat &#x201C;the Cabinet also held this view&#x201D;.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister of Sport and Recreation has finished disporting I will be glad to continue. We here have a case where the Public Service Commission, after due consideration, recommends a man for a post. It is their job to do so. It is rare for their recommendation or opinion to be overruled. In this case the hon. the Minister of Agriculture did so overrule their recommendation and the Public Service Commission reports that he did so repeatedly and with the knowledge of the Cabinet. When this happens one would argue that the Cabinet in general, and the hon. the Minister in particular, who has insisted on this particular appointment, should bear a very special responsibility for the behaviour of that senior official whom he has appointed. If, for example, a head of a department had been appointed on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission and the hon. the Minister had not intervened he would still have borne a <span class="col_9063-9064" refersTo="page_1665"/>responsibility to ensure that that department, from its head down to the very bottom, was operating in an efficient and proper manner. Where he intervenes and overrides the Public Service Commission, however, and appoints a man who in the view of the Public Service Commission is not considered on merit or seniority to be the right man for that post, he bears a very special responsibility. The hon. the Minister now has his own man as head of the department and he obviously delegates to him a great deal of responsibility. He is entirely satisfied that everything is operating in the best possible way in the best of possible worlds.</p>

<p>He then goes on to his second mistake, namely the question of delegation. The whole matter of delegation has been argued and I would like to lay down this essential principle which I think is recognized in the field of public administration. It is entirely permissible for a Minister to delegate some of his functions. But a Minister can never delegate his responsibilities. This is the point. If the hon. the Minister delegated certain functions, then it is a matter for his discretion how far he should go. If he feels that he is delegating a wide discretion in regard to functions, then he must provide his own checks and balances and he must remain satisfied that this delegation will not be abused. What he cannot delegate, is his responsibility. Our charge against the hon. the Minister is that he also delegated his responsibility. It is not good enough to stand up in this House and say: &#x201C;Because I delegated my functions to a civil servant, I also absolved myself of all responsibility.&#x201D; He is doing nothing more than hiding behind that civil servant.</p>

<p>It is the duty of a Minister to maintain vigilance over his department. This is the whole basis of our democratic system. You have a bureaucracy. You have an executive. It is right that Parliament should hold Ministers responsible for the actions of that executive. The Minister who is responsible to Parliament and, through Parliament, to the people of the country, must be held responsible for everything that is done by the executive branch and the administrative branch. If that Minister is not vigilant, then Parliament and the nation rightly call him to account. I should like to give an example of what is meant by vigilance. I, myself, had the privilege of serving under another Minister, Mr. Eric Louw. I can assure this House that Mr. Eric Louw would not only have exercised vigilance over such matters as R7&#x00BD; million, but that he would have exercised equal vigilance over such matters as R750. It was unthinkable in his department that anybody would spend money unauthorized, that anybody would take decisions affecting the finances of his department without referring that matter to him. Practically the only matter he overlooked&#x2014;perhaps he even went too far&#x2014;was the purchasing of pencils, erasers and fountain pen ink. However, beyond such minor matters, he was interested in every aspect of his department's administration. He would not let a thing pass without being informed as to what was going on. It was because of the climate which he created, because of the atmosphere of vigilance and interest which radiated from him, that abuses could not take place in that department. We say that that kind of climate did not exist in the Department of Agricultural Credit and Land Tenure. If it had, these officials would not have dreamed of taking a chance as they did. It would then have been unthinkable to do these things because they would have known that their vigilant Minister, if he had been of the kind which I have described, would have caught them out the very next day. It was because their whole action was preceded by a climate of indifference and carelessness that these officials thought they could get away with it. These officials were senior officials, men of experience. They were not children. They are not fools. They did not think they were dealing with a matter of no importance. They knew very well that what they were doing was a matter of the highest importance. R7&#x00BD; million is a very large chunk of the country&#x2019;s finances. They knew this perfectly well. They nevertheless believed that the climate of indifference, indolence and inefficiency in their department was such that they could pay out R7&#x00BD; million in this way without authority, without proper consultation, and get away with it. It is no good saying that after this happened, various steps were taken, that the hon. the Minister was vigilant and active and effective, because as soon as he found out it happened, he tried to do something about it. We are not even convinced on that score, Sir, but what we are convinced of is that before the thing happened the climate in that department must have been one of complete inefficiency and complete carelessness towards the expenditure of public money.</p>

<p><span class="col_9065-9066" refersTo="page_1666"/>Sir, I would like to make one more point on this subject, before I go on to another one. I believe that the hon. the Prime Minister is ultimately responsible for everything that happens in his Administration. It is all very well for hon. members on that side of the House to say that he knew nothing about it; that when he learned about it, he did what he could, and certainly no one is accusing the hon. the Prime Minister of any kind of impropriety of conduct in relation to this affair. But, Sir, the Prime Minister does bear responsibility for the manner in which his Administration conducts the affairs of this country. The Prime Minister shrugs off responsibility in this matter. The Prime Minister must take his choice. He can either ask for the resignation of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and in so doing admit openly and frankly to the public that a grave mistake has been made and that he is prepared to take the necessary steps to show that this kind of error, this kind of misconduct, will not take place again. This would be the proper and normal way for a Prime Minister to act when one of his Ministers is shown to have conducted the affairs of his department in such a way as to bring about this kind of public scandal. He can take that course, Sir, and he will then convince the people that although a great mistake has been made in the administration he is prepared to take the responsibility for it. The alternative. Sir, is to condone what has happened. He can say, &#x201C;I am not responsible; my Minister is not responsible; it is an administrative error and it is too bad&#x201D;, and condone what has happened. But then, Sir, he will be seen by this Parliament and by the public of South Africa as being tolerant of inefficient, extravagant and incompetent administration. Those are his choices.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to come now to another topic, the question of the Common Market. It is over 20 years since the Treaty of Rome was signed. This was a treaty whereby countries of Western Europe decided to form a common market for their common good. It is 20 years ago since that took place and many things have happened since then. It is at least ten years ago that the intention of the United Kingdom to join the Common Market became clear. It has always been clear to us, I think, what the impact of United Kingdom membership of the Common Market would be in broad terms. It was clear to all of us who were interested in South Africa's economy and in South Africa&#x2019;s trade position that if Britain were to join the Common Market, this would be highly detrimental to those special trade links which South Africa always enjoyed with Britain. It was obvious that South Africa would lose her preferential tariffs in Britain and that eventually, in respect of the whole of the Common Market area, that is to say, in Britain and Western European countries, South Africa would face uniform E.E.C. tariffs.</p>

<p>Sir, behind this broad and somewhat obvious fact, there are many matters of detail which have been closely studied by our economists and notably by our officials, both at home and abroad, for a great many years. It has been their duty, in the first place, to identify the commodities which would suffer in consequence of Britain joining the Common Market. It is quite clear what these are: They are mainly the products of the South-Western Cape, such as fruit, fruit juices, wines and liquors. There is a further commodity affected by this, notably sugar, because a great many of the fruit products, particularly canned fruit products, carry an element of sugar and this is at present taxed in Britain at a special preferential rate. On entry into the Common Market, on crossing the tariff frontiers of the Common Market, this sugar also would attract a much higher rate. The present position is likely to be reversed. From where we enjoyed the special tariffs, an advantage which was calculated to be worth at least 6 per cent on price, we now have to sell in a Common Market where the disadvantage in relation to the other producers of these particular products may be as high as 50 per cent if the sugar content of these products is taken into account.</p>

<p>We have identified the commodities and these are known. Attempts have also been made to identify the time factor, namely when Britain will be admitted as a member of the Common Market and how long it would take Britain to align her tariffs with those of Common Market countries, in other words when the full impact will take place. We have studied, or should have studied, the problem of the processing industry. It is said that some R60 million is invested in the fruit and liquor processing industry in the Western Cape. This is obviously a major investment factor which needs the most careful study and investigation <span class="col_9067-9068" refersTo="page_1667"/>in order to ensure that the impact on this very important sector of our capital equipment is protected.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that if we lose these large and important markets&#x2014;Britain takes about a third of our exports&#x2014;one of she things we would have to do is to study the possibility of finding alternative markets. One alternative market is the South African market itself. At the moment the South African market takes only about 10 per cent of these products. What should have been done and what must be done is that far more attention be given to the development of the South African domestic marketing of these products. This is not the whole answer, and is only a very small part of it, but it would make a contribution. We still need to find markets which will earn us the foreign exchange which we are likely to lose when Britain enters the Common Market. There is the whole question of the exploration of foreign markets. We must look at our own productive economy in this field. We must also study what can be done to adapt ourselves to this new challenge. There is. for example, the case of the Citrus Board which, while its actions have not been without reproach in every respect, has in fact had the good horse sense to develop its markets in Europe. It has gone out of its way with some most imaginative schemes and has secured allocations, with the help of the Government, for the sale of oranges in Europe in their off-season. This kind of aggressive action has in fact assured that in the case of citrus the damage done will not be nearly as great as would be the case with deciduous fruits. We have deciduous fruits, such as apples and pears, which are highly vulnerable to Britain&#x2019;s entry into the Common Market. There are other fruits, such as peaches, apricots, grapes and so on, which might in fact through the same sort of action as has been undertaker by the Citrus Board, namely by the judicious exploitation of the seasonal differences, by the development of new markets, by advertising, and by initiative, be marketed by action of this kind. All these studies have to some extent already taken place and officials are to be commended for the industry with which they have tackled these problems.</p>

<p>But what has been done actively and effectively to prepare our way for this almost certain event which is due to take place? It is my charge that South Africa and this Government have wasted a great deal of time. It is a fact that Ministers have repeatedly visited Europe purporting to be studying the problems of the Common Market. What they have done is to ask repeatedly and to the embarrassment of our embassies abroad the same questions year after year. The study has continued year after year and they have received the same answers, slightly up-dated year by year. But what have they in fact done? It is for those people to make the studies and to inform the Ministers. That is fair enough, but it is for the Ministers to act. What I am asking tonight is what effective action has been taken in preparation for what is to take place.</p>

<p>I would like to read, in case anyone should think that I am exaggerating, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2019; own words describing his previous visit to the Common Market countries, and his intentions for his more recent one. I am quoting from Hansard, column 7850&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I should like to add that the purpose of my visit last year was not to submit formal requests to the E.E.C. group or to Britain. At that stage the purpose of my visit was to have frank discussions.</block>

<p>Now, &#x201C;frank discussions&#x201D; had been going on for ten years. He went back for some more&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From the nature of the case I am of the opinion that this is the way to go about this. One should first have frank discussions concerning one&#x2019;s problems.</block>

<p>That is first, second and last. He then goes on to discuss the purpose of his most recent visit. He said he would have a conference with our Ambassadors in the E.E.C. countries and with our Ambassador in London. Now, Sir, these very same Ambassadors had been reporting on these very same matters for the past ten years, and I have no doubt, they still do. Nevertheless, a discussion was necessary. He goes on in column 7856&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My first step will be to hold discussions in London next week with our Ambassadors in the E.E.C. countries and with our Ambassador in London. At that conference we shall formulate a procedure according to which we will be able to remain in contact with one another&#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_9069-9070" refersTo="page_1668"/>That is a good formula!</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and to co-ordinate our actions in respect of the E.E.C. countries and the possible British entry and achieve a greater measure of concerted action in order to meet this problem. After these deliberations next week, we shall consider requesting an interview with the Council of Ministers of the E.E.C.</block>

<p>Ten years have passed, and this is how far we have got.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that we should seek out other markets. We must develop new markets urgently and we have to find the right places for them, I suggest, for example, that Africa and the Far East offer better possibilities than some other areas. We must exploit the possibility of seasonal markets. We have the great advantage of being in the Southern Hemisphere. This is something which, with initiative, imagination, and advertising enterprise, can be exploited to a large extent. We must adapt our local production in respect of processing, if necessary. We must develop our South African markets We must ensure that, if we have to give relief and subsidy, these are of a temporary nature and do not become permanent. South Africa cannot afford to subsidize these industries forever. We must take effective action, which we have not seen and which we hope to hear more about from the Minister. We do not want to hear about the talks which have taken place. We know they have been going on for ten years.</p>

<p>The whole of this Common Market episode has been a long story of delay and dithering, of incompetence and confusion. We are waiting for action. We want to know what is going to be done for this most important sector of our economy. If the Government is not up to the task of planning for this important change which is to affect an important area of South Africa, they must give way to another Government. We want a Government which can lead, adapt and inspire. We want a Government to whom economics is not a closed book. The Common Market may hold the possibilities of a grave crisis and certainly a great challenge. In the face of crises, this Government tends to vacillate. In the face of challenge, it tends to surrender. In respect of the Common Market, we wish neither to fear this crisis nor do we wish to evade the challenge. We believe it is most important for the economy of South Africa, particularly at this time of growing trade deficits, that this problem, this challenge, this conflict has to be met and defeated. We have heard all about these meetings, about the studies, difficulties and problems. Let us hear now about the solutions. Let us hear about the way in which we are going to solve this problem to the benefit of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what struck me during the past session was the fair degree of unanimity displayed by the United Party on two occasions. In the first instance, at the commencement of the parliamentary session at the beginning of this year, it was stated with great acclaim that the United Party would make short shrift of the National Party in the no-confidence debate. This was announced with great acclaim because this matter enjoyed great publicity in the English language Press. Sir, you know what the outcome, on a subsequent occasion, was of that major attempt the United Party was supposed to have launched.</p>

<p>The second occasion on which I noted a fairly large degree of unanimity among the members of the United Party, was towards the end of the session when a hue and cry was raised once more in an attempt to close on a high note. We have seen in this debate so far that this hue and cry has abated and died away. As I say, there was a fair degree of unanimity on those two occasions. As far as I could see. those were the only two occasions on which the United Party reached unanimity. This was so because the newspapers, in both cases, told them what to do. As far as the second occasion is concerned, one was able to read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> yesterday in great detail the entire speech made by the hon. member for Durban Point. The speech the hon. member for Durban Point made this morning was given to him word for word in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> As a result o&#x00A3; the things said by that newspaper every member on that side of the House had the opportunity of studying those statements and these points of attack and they were consequently able to display a fair degree of unanimity in this <span class="col_9071-9072" refersTo="page_1669"/>House this afternoon. There was unanimity among the members of that Party because they were able to attack the National Party. This Party, which has done nothing but good for South Africa over the past 23 years, must now be belittled and these Ministers, as well as the hon. the Prime Minister, have to be attacked and belittled.</p>

<p>Throughout this session hon. members on that side of the House failed to come forward with positive and productive criticism. Not one single matter has been raised in this House which one could listen to in order to ascertain what it is the United Party has to offer. But when it comes to criticism, one finds that these people present a common front, because their actions then are the same as those of the gossip-mongering little party which is now putting up a candidate in the Water berg election. Their method of action is to speak derogatory from and cast suspicion upon leaders. As far as the Agliotti case is concerned, the true state of affairs have been stated quite clearly by the hon. the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and other members on this side of the House.</p>

<p>But, Sir, this did not satisfy them. The people of South Africa must know that we have a United Party in this country and we must go from here with the same hue and cry that was raised in coming to Cape Town. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave us a code of behaviour as far as the Ministers are concerned. He said he was prepared to ask his Ministers for a balance sheet in respect of their shares, and so forth, if he were to come into power one day. The Leader of the Opposition committed himself in this regard. The Agliotti case has been discussed here throughout the afternoon and the question of the delegation of the powers of Ministers, something which has been applied through the years, has been raised. I now want to ask the Leader of the Opposition what he is going to do in this regard. Is he going to allow his Ministers to delegate their powers, yes or no?</p>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, I was dealing with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when the House adjourned. I referred to the code of behaviour the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was going to lay down for his Ministers if they were to come into power again one day. He said he would demand from each of his Ministers a balance sheet showing his shares and assets in order to judge whether such a person would be able to handle the interests of the country. Furthermore, I asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a question in regard to the delegation of powers. It is a pity the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not here to reply to those questions. I take it the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not think it necessary to furnish me, as a banckbencher in this House, with the replies to these questions. It may also be that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not see his way clear to furnish replies to these questions. The fact of the matter is, or I would rather say I presume that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will also allow powers to be delegated through his Ministers. Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition called upon the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to resign for not having correctly delegated or used, according to the Opposition, the powers he had delegated, I take it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, when he delegates powers, will also call upon his Ministers to resign. In other words, what we have here is a completely clear code of conduct laid down by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in which he tells us how he is going to act when they come into power one day. I now want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if that is the attitude he is going to adopt towards his own Cabinet, towards the people in whom he puts his trust, it reflects, in my opinion, the same altitude this Opposition Party displays through its leader and the policy it advocates in regard to the people of South Africa, i.e. a lack of confidence, because how can one possibly have confidence in people who have constantly been letting you down over a period of 23 years? When listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition it is quite clear to me that he suffers from a complete lack of confidence and that is why he is trying to make out a case by laying down such a code of conduct in order to get at the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. Let us look at the position of agriculture in 1948 in pursuance of what was said by the hon. member for Newton Park here. He said that this Minister of <span class="col_9073-9074" refersTo="page_1670"/>Agriculture never wanted to accept any responsibility and that when one wants to try and argue with him, he always tries to get out of the argument. Consequently, he says, the farmer in South Africa stands alone. When we look at Hansard, column 2515, of 2nd March, 1948, we will see what the attitude of a previous United Party Government was towards the farmer of South Africa. When the question of the bywoner and sharecropper in this country was discussed at that stage, it was said that they had become a tradition and that these people were happy and content. It was also said that these people preferred to remain bywoners instead of buying land. That was the attitude their Minister of Lands at that time displayed towards the farmers of South Africa. I find it reprehensible of the hon. member for Newton Park to say that this Minister has never accepted any responsibility towards the farmers of South Africa and that when one argues with him he always tries to get out of the argument, while the farmer of South Africa stands alone.</p>

<p>What was the position in 1948? When the National Party came into power in 1948 we had meatless days. We had to inquire at every little shop whether it had a piece of organdy to sift flour with The flour had to be sifted to get rid of the bran and rubbish it contained so that one would be able to bake a loaf of bread. In those days it was impossible to bake a cake for a wedding or an occasion of that nature. There was no food in South Africa. We can still recall how we had to buy petrol with coupons and that we had to produce coupons with which to buy half a bag of mealie-meal. That was the position. In those days we had 125 000 farmers on the farms.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether the sacrifices he mentions were not essential to ensure the freedom of being able to sit in a free Parliament as he is sitting over there now&#x2026; [Interjections.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#du_plessis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. C. DU PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has put a question to which I want to reply by telling him that the flagrant irresponsibility on the part of the United Party Government towards the farmers of South Africa was responsible for the fact that there was no food in this country. Those are the facts of the matter.</p>

<p>On 2nd March, 1948, (column 2515 of Hansard) the hon. the Minister of Lands replied saying that every farmer now had his bywoner. He said that almost every farmer in South Africa had his bywoner. In other words, if my calculations are correct, it means that 50 per cent of our people belonged to the bywoner class. This is a word this side of the House detests. That is why the National Party tried to give co-ownership of the land of South Africa to the people of South Africa who were interested in farming. Everything possible was done to give these people a piece of land.</p>

<p>We are tackling major projects at the present moment. We are tackling water projects in this country in order to exploit and irrigate our country to provide a livelihood for those people who are interested in farming on organized irrigation lands. Now that we have fewer farmers in South Africa the United Party blames the Government for having ensured that the farmer of South Africa is economically independent and sound. I should like to quote a few figures in regard to maize. When this figure is calculated on an average five-yearly basis, the production of maize in South Africa dropped from 5,6 bags per morgen to 5,5 bags during the 20 years preceding the coming into power of the National Party. During the first ten years after the National Party had come into power production increased from 5,5 to 9,5 bags per morgen. In addition, the land under cultivation increased from 3,4 million morgen to 5,4 million morgen. This should be viewed as a whole. Up to the present production has increased to 14,9 bags per morgen. Land under maize at present totals 6,2 million. I challenge the United Party and the hon. member for Newton Park to tell me in which part in the country, where it rains, one will find a lack of confidence in agriculture. It is a different matter in those parts where it did not rain and where one may find there a temporary feeling of despondency amongst our people. But then the National Party has made arrangements in various spheres. I do not want to waste the time of the House by mentioning them, but the National Party has rendered substantial aid in order to help these farmers to overcome their problems in the transitional period.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park once again raised the question of the debts of <span class="col_9075-9076" refersTo="page_1671"/>the farmers. When the hon. the Minister told him that he should bear in mind that the entire burdens of debt of the farmer could not be attributed only to agriculture but that other goods were bought as well, he was the one who mentioned Cadillacs. On a subsequent occasion the hon. member tried to make us believe that the hon. the Minister said that the farmers had bought Cadillacs. In this way the United Party always tries to distort the truth.</p>

<p>In regard to the meat position, we know that the increased production in this country was such that the existing facilities are inadequate to handle this amount of meat. Furthermore, the hon. member spoke about bread. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that bread is being subsidized by this Government to the extent of R29 million? This is an enormous amount. But when the prices of produce were increased this year as a result of the fact that this Government showed a great deal of sympathy towards the farmers of South Africa, the United Party was most unwilling to express its gratitude. Not one of them was prepared to thank this Government on behalf of the farmers of South Africa, a few of whom are represented by those hon. members. However, these are the people who at election times, want to make the fanners of our country believe that they are the champions of the farmer in this House. That is not so. The farmers of South Africa, under this Government, had their share of the prosperity which was possible in this country.</p>

<p>What we had from the hon. the Opposition was a little brochure. They speak about production costs, as did the hon. member for Newton Park tonight. He said that the production costs of the farmers would be taken into account and that their profit would be added afterwards, Those of us concerned with agriculture, who live on the farms and who get up there in the morning, who have a love of the land and who want to farm, and who will not be dependent upon dole-outs but who want to do our share and carry out the traditional task of the farmer in South Africa, can see through this bluff of the United Party. Owing to the climatic conditions in South Africa it is simply impossible to say that the Government would be repaired every time to guarantee the farmers their production costs plus their profits. This is simply impossible.</p>

<p>Every time important matters were discussed in this House during the past session the United Party kept silent and refused to adopt a standpoint. That was the code of behaviour adopted by the United Party. I have indicated the hue and cry they and their newspapers raised before the commencement of this session. It is quite clear to me that, through their newspapers which tell them what to say and do and which published word for word the entire speech made by the hon. member for Durban North yesterday, they have been trying to leave this House with as much acclaim at the end of the Parliamentary session. This would be the only way in which they can let the people of South Africa know that the United Party still exists. But this United Party wants to get back into power. They have repeatedly told us that they want to get back into power. From all the arguments they have advanced it was quite clear that they do not care what kind of arguments they advance, as long as they can get back into power. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said on occasion that 70 per cent of our people have to live on 13 per cent of our land. When an Opposition, of whom it is expected to act in a responsible manner, advances arguments such as these it places South Africa in an embarrassing position. This confused standpoint adopted by the United Party in respect of a people consisting of a population of 20 million, as they say we have in South Africa, is not only confusing to the people in South Africa who listen to them and who believe them, but it is particularly confusing to the outside world against whom South Africa has to make out a case every day.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point said this afternoon that, in 1948, he was proud of being called a citizen of South Africa; proud to display the orange flash on his shoulder.</p>

The National Party, unlike the United Party, is not prepared to bruit abroad popular and cheap stories throughout the country and in the rural areas in particular when it comes to election times. This Government is prepared to develop the country systematically and in a balanced way within the growth rate that has been laid down.</p>

<p>Against the background of this picture I want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park that this Government will look after the interests of the farmer of South Africa because this Government knows that, when a strong economy has to be built up in a country, when such a country has become an industrial country, when a strong Defence Force has to be established, when one has to have huge food supplies for emergencies, it is essential for such a government to look after the interests of its farmers. For that reason we, as farmers, are confident and we know that we have in power in South Africa a Government which is not only prepared to show towards the farmer the same respect the farmer shows towards the Government, a Government which is not only prepared to show respect towards every inhabitant of this country, whether White. Brown or Black, but a Government that will see to it that the farmer of South Africa will never become dependent upon the United Party,</p>

<p>I want to quote one figure in respect of the income earned by our young people last year. An amount of R555 million was earned by our young people between the ages of 18 and 23 years last year. This is equal to approximately twice the value of a normal maize crop in one year. What we are dealing with in South Africa, is relations between the peoples, and the future. And because we have to build a future for this country, we should ensure that the relations between our various national groups here in South Africa is such that there will be harmony, co-operation and mutual respect. What this Government is doing, is building a future not only for that for which we accept responsibility today, but also for our young people who have to develop this fine land of ours even further. When we consider the capabilities and the income of these people with a view to what is held up to them in the future in a country which enjoys peace and prosperity, I am convinced that we can leave here and go back to our homes knowing that our young people will also support the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition holds a record in that he has been moving motions of no-confidence in this House for a period of 19 years. It is only in that respect that he beats the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. The hon. the Minister of Agriculture has been the Minister of Agriculture for 13 years in this country and through these years we have come to know him as a person who is honest in his dealings with our farmers, a person who does not bruit abroad popular stories, but who knows the agriculture in South Africa better than any of his predecessors did, a person who knows the farmers of South Africa, who knows agriculture and who will develop agriculture in a manner that will redound to the honour of the National Party and for the benefit of all of us; not only of those who are concerned with agriculture, but also those concerned with the other sectors.</p>

<p>Sir. the hon. member for Heilbron made an interesting speech. He started with Agliotti and then he veered further and further away from Agliotti until he eventually ended up in 1948. And when he came to 1948. he veered back, and the strange thing is that the hon. member ended with Agliotti again. It seemed to me as if the hon. member had the name &#x201C;Agliotti&#x201D; on the brain. I do not blame him for that, because it is an interesting case.</p>

<p><span class="col_9079-9080" refersTo="page_1673"/>Sir, the second point I should like to make with reference to the speech made by the hon. member for Heilbron is this: He probably mentioned the name of the <i>Sunday Times</i> ten times. The <i>Sunday Times</i> is a newspaper, and I can fully appreciate that the hon. member for Heilbron and other hon. members on that side are extremely uneasy when it comes to newspapers, of both launguage groups, for was it not in fact a Nationalist newspaper that blazed this matter abroad? It was <i>Die Beeld</i>, not so? Let us rather leave that matter at that. Sir, I am very glad that the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is present, because I have an idea that not very long ago a certain case in South-West, which also fell under his department, was also made public by a newspaper. This was the case of the renowned, or famous, Mr. Strauss.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister did not read about it in the papers, it is strange that it took him months to become aware of the position and to find out about that story. I say it is strange that the hon. the Minister found it out shortly after reports about it had appeared in the newspapers.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the Agliotti case for a moment. I also read the report and I remember thinking that we were dealing here with a department which was engaged in the biggest single land transaction in its history. The question that occurs to me is how it is possible that the biggest land transaction, amounting to R7&#x00BD; million, did not even come before the Cabinet, while a case such as that of a Japanese jockey was indeed discussed by the Cabinet. The matter did not even come before the Minister, but when a Chinese schoolchild takes part in a game, a Minister is quick to act. However, when the department is dealing with the biggest transaction in its existence, i.e. one of R7&#x00BD; million, the hon. the Minister does not know about it and has to learn of it by chance. I want to repeat that this is the strangest and most unbelievable case I have ever come across in my life.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron asked how we could blame the hon. the Minister and why we paid attention to gossip. Does the hon. member really think that we must keep quiet when this kind of thing happens? Does he expect an Opposition which is worth its salt to keep quiet when the Department of a Minister makes such blunders? [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron spoke about the delegation of powers, and now he is again looking to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for guidance. He wants to know what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would do under certain circumstances. I now want to tell the hon. member that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition would expect Ministers to delegate their powers as it is done in any country. But the hon. the Leader would not expect his Ministers to delegate their responsibilities as well. This is precisely what the hon. the Minister wants to do. How far must a department go wrong and to what extent must a department blunder and muddle before this House can say that a Minister is not doing his work? How far must an hon. Minister go wrong before the hon. the Prime Minister will tell him to resign? When do we reach that point? How far does the hon. the Minister think things have to go wrong first?

However, this is an expensive lesson for any nation, and I want to return to the cardinal question, i.e. how many mistakes of this nature must be made before an hon.

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister is always very quick&#x2014;and I say this with respect&#x2014;to say: &#x201C;I have the courage of my convictions&#x201D;. I do not blame him for saying that; but I wish he would imbue his hon. colleagues with that courage, so that the hon. the Minister will also say: &#x201C;No country can afford this&#x201D;. The hon. member for Durban Point said this afternoon: &#x201C;I am proud of being a South African&#x201D;. I submit for the consideration of this House that a people and a country cannot be proud of this kind of action. One cannot be proud of being a South African while in other Western countries a Minister resigns for something far less serious. Then my own hon. Minister tells me that he need not resign. He, and he alone, is to blame for these things having happened. If his department had known that he was exercising the necessary control. they would not have dared to do such a thing. But it is because they know that they may possibly get away with this kind of thing that they did so. Now the question occurs to me&#x2014;are there not perhaps actions with which they do in fact get away? How do we know? Only the tip of the big iceberg has come to light. Where are the other matters which do not come to light?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I say there has been negligence of the highest order in that department. One of the examples has come to light, and one cannot blame the people for asking: &#x201C;Are there not more such examples of which we do not know?&#x201D; No one can blame the people for that. The hon. the Prime Minister says that the crux of the whole matter was the valuation, the clay content of the land. Everything hinged on that. If the valuation had been correct, no problems would have arisen. Why did the hon. the Prime Minister have to find this out? Was it not the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture to establish this <span class="col_9083-9084" refersTo="page_1675"/>very point? Why did the hon. the Prime Minister concern himself with these matters? Up to this evening, after all the talk by Ministers and hon. members, we are still looking for the cheque. Where is it? What has become of it? I know that up in Kimberley there is a cheque of Rhodes for &#x00A3;5 million; it is framed. It is strange that we cannot find the R7&#x00BD; million cheque to frame it. This is the kind of cheque that should be framed in South Africa.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Heilbron put the following question to my hon. Leader. He told my Leader; &#x201D; You now want to lay down certain limits as far as shareholding is concerned.&#x201D; &#x201C;You want to do this,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;because you do not have confidence in your people.&#x201D; Sir, that is not the point. The point which my hon. Leader has in mind is that he wants to show the people outside that they can have confidence in the people sitting in the Cabinet. That is the point. The people have to know. They must be able to see from the actions of the Cabinet that they are worthy of their trust. That is why my hon. Leader raised the point.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with something else. The hon. the Prime Minister recently made the closing speech at the Republic Festival. There he raised a few illuminating points, which may perhaps be mentioned here this evening. He said the next four, five years would be decisive in the history of South Africa. When I heard those words, I asked myself, if the next five years are going to be so decisive, what is the human material, particularly in the Cabinet, which the hon. the Prime Minister has at his disposal and with which he has to lead South Africa in the next five decisive years? The hon. the Minister of Agriculture, must we say more than has been said already, except that he is trying to disguise and sell margarine as butter?</p>

Things always start on the Rand, but I want to tell the hon. the Minister today that he is not far from petitions here in the Peninsula as well.

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir. The Minister of Economic Affairs knows he advocates a policy which is curbing the growth rate of South Africa, because if he does not do so, it means they will have to throw their entire ideological Bantu policy overboard, because they will then have to bring in more Bantu. Sir, the hon. the Minister and his party may choose now. As far as the future of South Africa is concerned, the position seems clear to me. The young South African people have been sick and tired of the old history for a long time. They no longer want to listen to the story of 1948. They only know that South Africa has a capacity few other young countries in the world have. All that the young people of South Africa ask the Government, <span class="col_9087-9088" refersTo="page_1677"/>is to take its foot off the brake, because South Africa wants to move forward. All they want is someone else at the helm in South Africa. The young people of South Africa know no fear.</p>

<p>I now return to the point put so ably by the hon. member for Durban Point this afternoon; it is exactly what the young people are looking for. They say: &#x201C;We want to go into the outside world and look it in the face, not only as proud South Africans, because we are that in any case. We are all proud of being South Africans.&#x201D; The young South Africans, both men and women, want to move in the outside world, not only with pride in themselves but also in the knowledge, that they command the respect of their fellow peoples. Whether he is in Tokyo, London or New York, the South African wants to know, as he knew years ago, that he is not only a person with self-respect, but that he is also a member of a people which is respected by the other Western nations of the world. As long as we allow the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs to apply this empty policy of his, as long as the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development builds his tower in the Bantu territories while leaving the Bantu in the urban areas in the lurch, and as long as the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the hon. the Minister of Finance allow the wonderful growth potential of South Africa to be restricted, I say, the young people of South Africa will not succeed in looking the outside world in the face with self-respect and in commanding the respect of those people. I think the day will come, and it is not far off, when this state of affairs will be changed. because the more the hon. the Prime Minister says he has confidence in his Cabinet, the more the people are beginning to believe that that confidence no longer exists.</p>

<p>Now, the newspapers may write and hon. members may talk about gossip but it is not gossip that will kill that party. It will be the facts that are revealed in the Press. Those facts and a lack of policy, in the first place, will kilt that party. In the second place, maladministration and a lack of proper control, as revealed to us so tellingly this afternoon, will also contribute to it. These are the causes which will force this Government to its knees, and the sooner the better for South Africa,</p>

<p>I have already discussed this matter on dozens of occasions. I must disappoint you and hon. members on the other side of the House beforehand, in that what I am going to say tonight, has already been said on numerous occasions. It has not only been said by me. It has also been said by other members on this side of the House. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and all members on the other side of the House always refer to the urban Bantu only. Have you noticed that, Sir? They never refer to the Bantu in the White area. They only refer to the urban Bantu. No mention is made of the Bantu on the farms, and they represent roughly one-third of the Bantu population. Why not?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>If I am supposedly talking nonsense, as is being grumbled in this direction by an hon. member opposite, why does one hear all that howling and whining on the other side? After <span class="col_9089-9090" refersTo="page_1678"/>all, if I am talking nonsense, there is no need for other people to drown my speech by their shouts. I know what the United Party&#x2019;s policy is in regard to the Bantu. I shall come to that, for that is my object tonight. The hon. member for Maitland said that to us urban Bantu were merely phantoms beyond the mountains, and numbers. Far from that. To us this matter is a very real one, as I shall demonstrate to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Earlier in this debate, this morning, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again referred cursorily to the so-called urban Bantu. I should like them to speak in future about the Bantu in the White area as well. They should not forget that one- third of them are in the rural areas, outside the cities. What I want to say about this matter tonight, will to a large extent be a repetition of what I said in this Chamber on 19th May.</p>

<p>However, I want to say in advance that nobody in this Chamber, not even the most optimistic member on my own side, should even entertain the idea that the two sides in this Chamber will reach agreement on this topic tonight or any other day. Therefore I want to say in advance that the next speaker or one of the other speakers on that side of the House who will follow me in this debate, will probably say that the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development did not satisfy them at all with what he had said. And we know this. I do not strive after satisfying them. As regards policy in respect of this matter, there is a huge gulf between us.</p>

<p>My object tonight is to point out the basic differences that exist. If the hon. members would allow me to speak and do not refuse to listen to me I should like to point out the basic differences between the National Party and the United Party. I want to point out the unrealistic and extremely dangerous policy of the Opposition as compared to National Party policy, which offers a reasonable basis, with safeguards, for the continued existence of the Whites as well as each of the Bantu peoples.</p>

<p>In my speech tonight I shall deal with the relations aspect, only in respect of the Whites towards the Bantu peoples. The first statement I want to make here, is one which I made before. I just want to repeat it, namely that to the National Party the Bantu in the White area&#x2014;as you can hear, I am not referring to the urban area&#x2014;are, just as are the Bantu living in the homelands, people who exist, live and are born within a national context. They exist within the national context of their own particular Bantu people which is linked with the particular Bantu homeland of that people. Here we have a fundamental and deep-rooted difference between the two parties. We say that every Native in the White area, even if he were born here and did not know the chief of his ancestors in the homeland, knows of what people he is a member and what his language is. Hon. members may ask any Bantu from Cape Agulhas to Messina about it, and every Bantu will immediately tell you what his language is. That is the indication of his national context. Therefore, to suggest that the Natives in the White areas have become detribalized and alienated. Westernized and are ready for being absorbed along with the Whites into one whole, is rubbish, ignorance and wishful thinking on the part of people who are seeking support beyond the colour bar between Whites and Blacks. The Natives have retained their tradition and their distinctive national character, even here in the White area where they are living. That is why it is true that a Bantu, whether he is living in or outside his homeland, is nevertheless a member of a particular people. If they have become detached from the tribal authority of their chief and councils, it still does not mean by a long chalk that such Bantu persons have become detached from their people.</p>

<p>These views which I am putting forward here, are not only held by me. They are not phantoms on this side or that side of the mountain. These are the hard real facts, which I heard in my chambers in Pretoria as recently as 25th May, when my officials and I were deliberating with nine or 10 members of the Tswana Government. On this occasion their chief executive councillor, Chief Mangope, told me <i>inter alia</i> the following&#x2014;and I am going to read his words as I wrote them down there (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Tswanas in Atteridgeville (i.e. the Bantu residential area west of Pretoria) and of Soweto form one people along with the homeland people, and it will be ensured that they will be accepted as such and integrated with the traditional tribal authority, the foundation of the people&#x2019;s government.</block>

<p><span class="col_9091-9092" refersTo="page_1679"/>hon. members should also pay particular attention to the following statement he made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We&#x2014;i.e. the Tswanas&#x2014;do not want to be two nations, namely one in the homeland and one in the Sowetos.</block>

<p>Those are our views, just as they were stated by that Bantu leader. Nor are these views only held by that Bantu leader. In a moment I shall deal with others in order that I may help that hon. friend out of his wishful thinking and delirious dreams when he says that we are dealing with phantoms.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I shall give the hon. member an opportunity at the end of my speech, which is limited to 30 minutes. If there is a minute left, I shall remember his question, but I cannot reply to it now. What is the United Party&#x2019;s express object? It is the exact opposite of what Chief Mangope said. The United Party wants to cut every Bantu people precisely in half, if not perhaps in three parts, namely those living in the homeland and, cut off from them, those living in the White urban areas. As I have said, they may just divide them into three groups, with the Bantu living in the White rural areas representing a third group. They want to divide the Bantu peoples into two parts. They want to build a real East Berlin wall.</p>

<p>National separation is the policy of the United Party. Why? We shall see why this is the case. They want to denationalize the Bantu living in the urban areas, and through a process of Westernization they want to incorporate them into the White community. What I am saying here, is not an imputation; these are words that were used by the hon. member for Mooi River. Earlier in this session he said that they were to be incorporated or absorbed into the White community by way of Westernization. I repeat that the United Party wants every Bantu person to live in two worlds, namely, firstly, his own world, in which he has to live by nature as the creature of his Creator and, secondly, the strange world of the White man, into which the United Party wants to force those Bantu persons. *</p>

<p>Not force into.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they are forced into it. The Bantu are not living in two worlds. I shall now repeat what practical steps we have taken to ensure that the Bantu live in one world, namely the world of their national context. The United Party, with that policy of cutting the Bantu into two nations, as Mangope said, wants to do something which, in essence, amounts to committing genocide. It wants to cut the child in half because it does not know who its mother is. The United Party will not succeed in dissociating the Bantu from their national context and traditions, for over a period of almost a century, during which the Bantu very intensively came into contact with the Whites and all the privileges of White civilization, the Bantu who were away from their homelands, did not lose themselves The United Party has a much smaller chance of doing this now, in view of all the means they now have at their disposal for uniting themselves. The United Party&#x2019;s policy actually implies that an injustice will be done to the Bantu in the sense that they will he torn loose from their own traditional anchors and their own national ties, that they will become displaced. From that side of the House we always hear the refrain about a &#x201C;rightless, rootless&#x201D; Bantu. If there should ever be &#x201C;rightless, rootless&#x201D; Bantu, Bantu without rights and without roots, it would be the Bantu who, under the policy of the United Party, are to be absorbed here into the White area along with the Whites. Our policy is aimed at anchoring in every respect the Bantu&#x2019;s rights and roots to their homelands, where their national membership and citizenship have their origins and anchors, and not here where we as Whites have ours. It is impossible for the United Party to think that it will Westernize the Bantu in this way, not only because, as I have said, they are very different from the Whites by nature, but also because their system of values and their way of life are so very different from ours.</p>

<p>I want to make a second statement, namely that we should, by way of keeping the Bantu in the White areas in touch with their homelands, promote in every possible way the reinforcement, consolidation and intensification of the bond between the Bantu in the White area and the Bantu in the homelands. It is for that reason that we have introduced many measures and are implementing many of them. I want to mention these measures cursorily. Firstly, I want to mention the very important <span class="col_9093-9094" refersTo="page_1680"/>Citizenship Act, which was passed by this Parliament last year and which we are implementing at the moment. In this legislation provision is made for the citizenship of every individual Bantu people in order that Bantu individuals, no matter where they may find themselves outside the homelands, may remain culturally and nationally connected with their respective peoples in their respective homelands. Secondly. I want to mention the existing institution in the Bantu homelands of chiefs, who appoint representatives here in the Bantu residential areas of Cape Town and all the other cities and towns to look after their tribal affairs here. Thirdly, I mention all the other very important developments, with which good progress has been made, particularly over the past few years, under the very capable administration of Deputy Minister Koornhof, namely the appointment of deputies or representatives of the territorial authorities and legislative councils in the homelands here in the White areas. We have already progressed to such an extent that as many as eight Bantu territorial authorities and legislative councils have proceeded to appointing these representatives. This is not being done by us. Those governments appoint them. Why? Because they believe in them. The Tswanas and all the others who have been granted legislative councils or territorial authorities&#x2014;it is unnecessary for me to name them all&#x2014;have already appointed them, and the two peoples that have not yet made those appointments, have representation by chiefs and will make these appointments before long. Sir, we know that almost 40 of these councils have been established, with their deputies and their assistants as well, and the number is increasing day by day and week by week. In this manner a large number of these councils will be established in all the White areas in South Africa. These deputies will look after the interests of those governments and those peoples here, not only in respect of the urban Bantu or the town Bantu, but also in respect of those in the rural areas themselves. In this way we are making it possible for the homeland government itself to maintain contact with its people here, to look up its own strayed members here and, in that way, to retain the context. Sir, this is the kind of thing which the United Party opposes, for it is ridiculed and disparaged wherever it is implemented.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to mention another example to you. This is, therefore, a very real example&#x2014; for the information of those hon. members who have been referring to phantoms&#x2014;i.e. that under our policy in the urban areas and in the rural areas we are giving the Bantu a link with their homelands by way of the franchise, as we have had it in the Transkei over the past eight years. [Interjections.] The hon. member who is drooling over there, does not even know how that system works, for these are not postal votes; they are real votes cast inside a polling booth or in the presence of the Bantu Affairs Commissioners. The hon. member does not know what he is talking about. Sir, two general registrations have already been carried out in respect of the Transkei alone. I want to ask you: Would 247 000 adult Transkeian voters in the White area have themselves registered if they did not see any value in retaining ties with their homelands? General registrations have already been carried out on two occasions, and the votes were also cast in that manner. This is a system which is going to be followed by all the other Bantu governments as they change over to self-governing territories within the Republic. In fact, even before they changed over to self-government in the Bantu areas themselves, two of these people spontaneously asked for this, namely the North Sothos and also the Zulus. May I read out to you, Sir, what no less a person than the present chief executive official of the Zulu Territorial Authority, Councillor and Chief G. Buthelezi, said about this matter in the speech he made last year when he thanked me and commented on my opening address in June, 1970. At the time he said the following about this very matter of liaison between their people in the White areas and their people in the homelands. I shall read his own words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_9095-9096" refersTo="page_1681"/>We further request the hon. the Minister and his department to assist us in devising a constitution which will include representation of Zulus scattered throughout the metropolitan areas of South Africa and from these farmlands.</block>

<p>He wants them to be integrated, and one of the methods is the franchise. The other method is these councils and deputies, to which I referred, and there are others as well.</p>

<p>But, Sir, there are, in addition, many other methods whereby we are bringing about this liaison, and one of these methods is that regular visits are paid to the homelands and that, as far as possible, there should be people who live in the homelands and are working in the White areas. In this respect I want to repeat the phenomenal figures with which this House was furnished on a previous occasion. In respect of the near future, in cases where the homelands are situated close to places of work, we have the position that there are almost 175 000 Bantu persons who are travelling to and fro every day, from their homes in the homelands to places of work in the White areas. Is that nothing?</p>

Secondly, we are making visits possible, not only in respect of places situated nearby, such as Rosslyn, Umlazi and others, hut also in respect of places situated more distantly. In this way we have this striking figure with regard to people who cannot travel such great distances between their places of work and their homes every day, i.e. that over the past Easter weekend, for instance, there were more than 45 000 Bantu passengers from distant places who paid visits just for the weekend. *</p>

<p>Do they go to Leganyane?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They also go to Leganyane, in their tens of thousands. That hon. member has only heard of Leganyane. They go there in their tens of thousands in their own buses and by way of other bus services. [Interjections.] That hon. member should restrain himself; he can speak once I have finished. But what is the United Party's attitude in regard to these matters? They reject the idea of citizenship for those people. Tonight we heard them mocking at and rattling about this citizenship and whatever we do. To them only one thing is right, namely to Westernize the Bantu and to absorb them here into the White area, with the White community.</p>

<p>We know what the attitude of the United Party is in this regard; we know that in 1961 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition very explicitly said in this House that the Whites and the non Whites here had to be one national entity. We also know what the United Party's attitude is, as expressed by the hon. member for Durban North, who said the same thing, namely that we formed one nation, the Bantu and the Whites with one another. I want to repeat that it is for this reason that they do not want the Bantu here in the White areas to have any contact with the homelands, be it traditional, cultural, or on any other basis. They want to absorb the Bantu here in the White jurisdiction area and form an entity with them. The hon. member for East London City is another one who said such absurd things in the past.</p>

<p>It is also for this reason that the United Party envisages franchise for the Bantu which will bring them to this Parliament and this is in contrast to what we say, i.e. that the Bantu should have the franchise in their own homeland and to their own parliament, even if they do live here in the White area. The Transkei has proved that this is practicable, and the other territorial authorities which are still to be established, will also prove this.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I want to make the statement that because of this unity and bond between <span class="col_9097-9098" refersTo="page_1682"/>the Bantu in the White areas and their fellow countrymen in the homelands, they are, in our view, present in White areas in a casual capacity. Therefore, they are not integratable with the Whites into one unit. The National Party&#x2019;s policy is that the Bantu are here in the White areas for the sake of the employment they want here and for the sake of the employment we can give them in a properly, statutorily ordered manner by way of the exemptions granted to them under the labour laws. Here the Whites have the exclusive right in every sphere, just as the Bantu, in turn, have it in the Bantu homeland areas, where the Whites do not have it. This holds good in respect of the extremely important question of labour, with which our measures for influx control go hand in hand. Here the Bantu only get such exempted labour as we may give them, and by those means tht Bantu are not put on a par with the Whites in the sphere of labour. They may not compete with the Whites in the high ranks until they eventually hold positions equal in rank to those of Whites, positions such as that of a foreman, manager or owner of a factory.</p>

<p>The Bantu get such employment as may be exempted for them, and that is why this is not integration, as is so often being said in error by members opposite, and as is also stated by other people in newspaper articles which we read. That is why we have influx control, which is also in the interests of the Bantu, and not only in our interests, because it protects their spheres of employment, because it is a guarantee to them against excessively low wage structures, and because it is also a guarantee to them in order that they may retain their employment.</p>

<p>Then I want to mention to you, Sir, the question of land ownership and residential facilities, on which we differ. Since the Bantu are here in a casual capacity, there will be no land ownership for them here, but they will in fact have residential facilities here and land ownership in the homelands. Then the Leader of the Opposition also said this afternoon that we were not providing the Bantu with proper housing. Does the hon. the Leader not know that at present there are in the urban Bantu residential areas in South Africa almost 400 000 houses for Bantu families to live in? Does the hon. the Leader not know that on the Witwatersrand alone there are almost 190 000 houses in Bantu residential areas, for families, about which they say at the same time that we usually disrupt and divide them.</p>

<p>The next aspect I want to mention, is that as far as politics is concerned, the attitude which is of course upheld in respect of the Bantu is that they are here in a casual capacity; in other words, that the Bantu do not have a share in the politics of the Whites, as they culminate in this Parliament. Of course, it is United Party policy that they will in fact have such a share. As far as that matter is concerned, we say that the aspirations of the Bantu culminate in their homelands, and we are making this possible along the lines I have already mentioned to you. As far as all these matters are concerned, the United Party stands for absolute integration, which means that the Bantu and the Whites will be integrated with one another in one context, on an equal footing, that along with the Whites they will acquire rights of citizenship here in the White area, that it will therefore be possible for the Bantu to settle in the White area, not only, as we say, primarily for labour purposes, but also for any social, economic, educational, civic or any other purposes-which is so different from our policy. Why? Because the United Party wants to throw open the spheres of employment without restrictions, merely for the purpose of getting more and more workers, for that is all they see in that Bantu person. To that hon. member who said tonight that we saw phantoms in the Bantu, I want to repeat this: In every Bantu person in the White area and in the whole of South Africa we see the human being who is a member of some Bantu people or other. We want to protect him and promote his interests; but those U.P. members only see the Bantu as tools for us in the industries in the White area. They only see workers. They only see labour units.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is definitely true. That is why such rights of citizenship as they may offer the Bantu here in the White areas, are all spurious rights.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite always have so much to say about this matter. I just want to point out that none other than the Leader of the Opposition, and also the hon. member for Yeoville, amongst others, <span class="col_9099-9100" refersTo="page_1683"/>have already admitted, by way of their statements, that the policy of the United Party, i.e. to integrate the Bantu with the Whites politically and otherwise, will lead to our being faced in South Africa with all sorts of situations which will become more and more critical. For instance, years ago the Leader of the Opposition admitted, and amongst other things the hon. member for Yeoville also admitted this in his famous &#x201C;television speech&#x201D;, that in terms of the policy of the United Party it would in the course of time be possible for Bantu to enter this Parliament. Now I want to say that this will not be the only sphere they will enter. The moment one enters Parliament, the highest institution in the country, one also has a right and a claim to all the other facets and spheres in society. Then we shall have what is called an Africanization of all our various spheres of life. We shall have an Africanization, an inundation by Blacks, of our Public Service, our system of education, our Parliament and our entire society in South Africa. What are the consequences of that?</p>

<p>Yes, Black danger that United Party&#x2019;s danger. What are the consequences of that? enmity, clashes, conflict.</p>

<p>To summarize, the United Party holds out no guarantees to the Whites or the Bantu in South Africa. As against that the National Party guarantees security, a future of their own and a sovereign White authority to the Whites in the White areas, not only to the urban areas. Consequently the Whites will have exclusive rights here, and there will be no integration with the Bantu. As against that the National Party also guarantees to the Bantu peoples, in a similar manner, security, a future of their own and sovereign authority over themselves in their Bantu homelands. There they will have exclusive rights, and we, the Whites, will have no such rights in their homelands. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is always interesting to see that when the Government has taken a battering, as it has done today on the mismanagement issue, somebody is thrown in against the trend of the debate to beat the tribal drum. As an exercise in semantics and in make-believe, this was really a tremendous performance. Surely, this hon. Minister must be in orbit, because he cannot be here in South Africa. He cannot be living here, because he is obviously somewhere else. He told us recently that when he spoke to Chief Matanzima, he did all the talking. Well, certainly I can accept that! He talks about a dialogue, but all that hon. gentleman is capable of is a monologue. He says that we want to split these people, to split their rural personality from their urban personality. However, have hon. members noticed the important difference this evening? The hon. the Minister talked about all these highfaluting concepts of citizenship and everything else, but he never told us once where they are earning a living Where are they working? Whose economy do they keep going? Is it not ours? Is this not introducing a split personality? He wants them to come and settle here, but he wants them to do this on a migratory basis. This is something that has been condemned by all thinking South Africans, including our Afrikaans churches. This is a cancer in the soul of South Africa. This shows that we have not succeeded in creating and shaping a cohesive economic society.</p>

<p>What does this hon. Minister really hold out to us as a solution? He denies the fact that these non-White peoples are living here and that they are earning their living here. He denies the fact that Soweto exists. It just is not here. But in the mean time he is creating all sorts of political trappings for them in their homelands. He is giving them flags, anthems, and all sorts of things, but the fundamental question as to how they will eat is shied away from. He has not even begun to give us an answer to that question. The mind boggles even at the ultimate solution if his is achieved. Can hon. members imagine the veritable tower of Babel that will be created here in South Africa if we have 22 independent Black nations? We shall have, in a microcosmic form, all the problems of the world. We shall have a United Nations right here in South Africa. The hon. the Minister said that he gives us a guarantee. If we follow that kind of policy I guarantee that it will be a short cut to political disaster.</p>

<p>What is happening here is that the Government cannot deal with the realities of the South African situation. Therefore they are escaping into something that does not exist. They cannot deal with the situation as it exists here today; therefore he <span class="col_9101-9102" refersTo="page_1684"/>and his department are spending all their time in creating elaborate blueprints for the future. They are trying to diffuse the reality of the present by building pies in the sky for some age that is only going to come later on.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, what is happening? This Government is blowing up a new Black nationalism in South Africa. They are creating a platform for these African leaders. One need only look at the latest pronouncement from Chief Matanzima, when he made certain specific demands for his people, I now want to warn those hon. members that history one day will show that that speech of Chief Matanzima&#x2019;s was as important as Gen. Hertzog&#x2019;s famous speech at De Wildt. If the African leaders continue with these requests, and if they become more extravagant in their demands, I also want to warn that this may well trigger off a white backlash which can wreak havoc with race relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then he wants to know what our point of view is. Our point of view is simply this: We accept differences where they exist, but we will not make differentiation our single goal, and turn separatism into a State religion. We know, too, that we shall all have one common destiny in South Africa, and from this amalgam of diversity which is South Africa today, we shall have to create a totality that will be stronger and bigger than the sum of its parts. That is the difference between us.</p>

<p>*Mr. Speaker, I actually wanted to refer to another matter. My hon. Leader initially showed today that there were three bases on which the Government could be attacked. One of them, of course, is the circumstances of life in South Africa. We are now engaged in the Third Reading of the Appropriation Bill. In the Second Reading debate I tried, just as my colleagues on this side, to draw the attention to certain shortcomings in the Budget. I tried to point out specifically that this Budget gives no indication of the Government&#x2019;s having formed a cohesive long-term economic strategy for South Africa. I tried to point out that it will do little to increase national productivity. I tried to point out that it will not stimulate the export of our goods. In the fourth place I tried to point out that it will make personal saving difficult, but that at the same time it condones increased expenditure on the part of the Government, and in the fifth place I tried to point out that it will affect our economic growth rate detrimentally, and that the cost of life will continue to increase. Absolutely nothing has happened since to make me change my point of view. I have even had all kinds of indications since that the diagnosis I tried to give of the factors which led to and which served as preliminaries to the drawing up of this Budget was right and correct.</p>

<p>But, as so often happens these days, there was no reaction to my arguments. On the contrary, I was subjected to a vehement personal attack. I know that when people resort to personal attacks, their own image will be harmed much more in the process than that of the person they attack. I also know that when it is necessary for someone to resort to personal attacks, he only shows his vulnerability in the personal as well as the political sense of the word. Sir, I have never been personal, and I will never want to be either, because I cannot think of a more obvious way to show one&#x2019;s own shortcomings. I will therefore not react to those personal arguments. I just want to say, however, that if the aim was to try to discourage or to silence me, it will of course not succeed, because as long as I have the honour to serve in this House, to represent voters here, I will say what I sincerely believe should be said, and I will do so to the best of my ability. I also know that my contribution will be judged not only by those who sit opposite, but also by the general public, and to that I will submit myself.</p>

<p>&#x2020;*Mr. Speaker, it is now two months since the Budget was introduced, and I think it is now possible for us to make an assessment of its effects. I noticed recently that the hon. the Minister, in an interview with an English-medium Sunday paper in Johannesburg, expressed the position thus: &#x201C;At this stage things are difficult, but they are not desperate.&#x201D; I can think of few statements less likely to instil confidence in South Africa. And then he went to town on this and condemned the newspapers and all sorts of other people for creating an air of pessimism. If this kind of statement does not trigger off pessimism I wonder what will. We must not close our eyes to the facts of the situation. There is an all pervading sense of pessimism in the business world. Nothing confirms it better than the recent survey by the Bureau of Economic Research of <span class="col_9103-9104" refersTo="page_1685"/>Stellenbosch. They found there is a lack of confidence and that this is brought about because there is a lack of certain essential materials, a lack of labour, lack of credit and because there is lack of confidence in the Government&#x2019;s ability to handle the economic situation. This lack of confidence stems fundamentally from two issues. To begin with there is uncertainty as to the Government's policy on certain important economic aspects. Secondly where there is in fact certainty on these issues, to put it mildly, businessmen and entrepreneurs regard these as decidedly unwelcome and undesirable.</p>

<p>Without a favourable business climate, without confidence there will not be investment at the rate required. Unless you have that kind of investment then obviously you will not have the necessary expansion in domestic production. These are the things we said at the time of the Budget. There is every indication now that our point of view is completely vindicated. At the moment our rate of growth is beginning to slow down. Nobody can deny this. This stems very largely from the Budget and the provisions of the Budget. I was interested to see what Mr. Mabin of Assocom had to say. This is a gentleman which the hon. the Minister frequently quotes with great satisfaction. Mr. Mabin now says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Quite frankly the Budget proposals appeared to me far from suited to the realities of the present situation.</block>

<p>The Minister has obviously lost a friend in the process. What is clear is that a slowing down in the growth rate in South Africa is not leading to a slowing down in price increases. In fact, the opposite seems to be happening. What is quite clear too is that a slowing down in growth is not leading to a belter balance of payments position. In fact the opposite is happening. We are still running a massive current deficit. The key to this situation is that if your rate of production of goods and services are slowing down and this is coupled with high expenditure and high demand, due to excessive Government expenditure, you create an imbalance between supply and demand. Under these circumstances your price increases begin to accelerate. This is quite obviously what is happening here. Inflation tends to feed on itself. Again if I may borrow from Mr. Mabin, he puts it this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under such conditions inflation may feed on itself because inflation itself holds back the growth of production of goods and services through breeding inefficiency, slackness and poor productivity performance.</block>

<p>That is the point of view we have taken up consistently and that is what is happening at the present time.</p>

<p>To most people the Government's motives in this whole matter are completely obscure. It would seem to us as though the hon. the Minister is engaged in a kind of economic bloodletting exercise. You will remember in days gone by, if ever a person got sick the quacks immediately brought on the leeches and they had to suck his blood. Invariably this left the patient in a weaker condition than before. It seems to us that with this present approach the Government is in fact engaged on a massive sort of blood-letting exercise. If you continue with a situation where you have a credit squeeze together with high taxes, then one or both of two things must develop. You will either create unemployment or have general insolvency. Both of these are taking place in South Africa at the present time on an increasing scale. Once you have set this pattern in motion, you must either stop right away before you damage the economy or else you must be prepared to go all the way. If you do not do this you are beginning to play a dangerous game of economic blind man&#x2019;s buff.</p>

<p>Everybody is confused about the present position because they can see the Government syphoning money out of the pockets of the public and out of the business organizations and they can see this Government taking the money and spending it. The public and everybody else are conscious of this kind of economic double talk we get from the Government. What is worse, they are beginning to suspect some kind of sadistic motive. There is no point in denying that many people are getting hurt at the present time. It would also be idle to pretend that they are not beginning to resent this. The large organizations with massive liquid capital reserves are in a position to ride out the storm, hut the smaller organizations which do not have the reserves or the staying power, must bear the full brunt of the Government&#x2019;s economic mismanagement. If organizations are suffering, the plight <span class="col_9105-9106" refersTo="page_1686"/>of the man in the street is infinitely worse. Every day now we get reports of people who are engaged in a tussle to make ends meet. To enjoy a decent standard of living in South Africa has become a luxury which fewer and fewer people can afford.</p>

<p>As my hon. leader said today, take a simple issue such as housing. What percentage of young couples in South Africa today can afford to acquire their own house? I suggest that, if you relate it to the growth of our national income you will find that that percentage is decreasing alarmingly. How many of our people to day can save for their old age? This proportion too is dwindling. Even if they do save for their old age, when they get to the stage when they want to use their money, they find that it is virtually worthless. Many of these essential things one has in all other modern communities, are denied to our people. The waiting lists for telephones are getting longer and longer. Our road systems are choked up. Our transportation systems are inadequate; there is a danger of a breakdown in essential services in South Africa. All these factors are symptomatic of the Government&#x2019;s &#x201C;poor but White&#x201D; plan for South Africa. Certainly, only the first part of this plan is being fulfilled. The more ideology they give us, the fewer the basic comforts we can enjoy. There is a well-known adage which says that the people get the Government they deserve. I think in South Africa one must add to that and say &#x201C;we also pay for the Government we have&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As part of all this ideology, a vast bureaucratic network is being built up. As my hon. leader pointed out today, where you site your factory and whom you employ are no longer business decisions, but are subject to the dictates of the ideology. Which school one sends one&#x2019;s children to is no longer a question of parental choice. It depends on what the machine demands. There seems to be a crisis of confidence developing in South Africa. As the people are losing confidence in the Government, so the Government manifests its own lack of confidence in the people by imposing further and further controls.</p>

<p>Look at the session we are coming to the end of now. Nearly 80 Bills have gone through this House. How many of them extended any sort of new freedoms or new privileges to our people? I can think of only one, the Sectional Titles Bill, which in any case was inspired by this side of the House. All the others have one purpose only, namely to put more power into the hands of the Government.</p>

<p>Look how glibly the hon. the Minister for Bantu Administration and Development talks of what he is building up for the Black people in South Africa. Why does he not tell the House that as far as the Black people are concerned at the moment, there are more than 80 laws and hundreds of regulations which determine practically every single aspect of the daily life of the African? That is the kind of freedom and the kind of guarantee he holds out for them. I want to say Chat there is this danger too: If you begin to impose restrictions of that kind on a section of your community, you put your whole society in chains. As Abraham Lincoln once said: &#x201C;No nation can endure being half slave and half free&#x201D;. What we are doing here is to sign away our own individual freedom.</p>

<p>To indicate how Government control is growing, let us just look at the growth of the Civil Service. In 1910 we had 12 State departments in South Africa. Today there are over 40. This is more than they have in France and in the United States of America where they run highly complicated and sophisticated societies. Between 1937 and 1966 the total South African population increased by less than 100 per cent. But those on a fixed establishment of the Government service increased by 276 per cent. Ten years ago, in 1960. 30 per cent of the Whites who were economically active in South Africa, worked for the Government. Today that figure is reaching up to 40 per cent. Prof. Ben Roux warns that if it is not stopped now, quite soon it will pass the 50 per cent mark. But the Government has built up this massive machine. It is becoming an economic dinosaur, sluggish and cumbersome. At the same time, the brains, as represented by the Cabinet, is becoming more and more effete. We see less and less signs of long term planning. There is more and more rigidity of behaviour. All these are inevitable precursors of extinction. These are obviously some of the things that Mr. Dirk Rezelman assessed when recently he was appointed with great fanfare to build up the image of the Government. But he is a shrewd salesman. He took one deep and penetrative look at this Nationalist Party and realized that it is not salcable.</p>

<p>That is the situation of South Africa as it is today. And the situation could be so <span class="col_9107-9108" refersTo="page_1687"/>different. All that stands between us and a better tomorrow is this Government. As my hon. Leader indicated today, the only barrier, the only obstruction we must remove is this Government and then South Africa could advance anew to what he indicated as the beckoning green fields out yonder. It is so easy if you can do away with all these pies in the sky and thest high faluling concept. Why does the Government not concentrate on the simple issues, the issues that people want? Think of our ordinary people&#x2014;they are not selfish, they are not crying for the moon. They are entitled to and they deserve certain things. They deserve decent housing. That one can give them. They need security for their old age. A country like South Africa with its bountiful resources, should be able to ensure that. They want security of employment and security of income. All this they can have provided all our people were to advance towards a new and a better life. We have all the ingredients for rapid noninflationary growth in South Africa. All that we must do is lake off the shackles and we will be astounded by our own strength. If we have a bigger cake, we can give everybody a more adequate slice of it. The whole system of Government must change. This remoteness that we notice now must be changed because the Government has grown away from the people who put them there. The longer the Government remains in power, Sir, the more it begins to try to preserve itself in that position and to safeguard itself. Sir, we would have a completely different approach. We would reaffirm the kind of participatory democracy that the old Voortrekkers introduced in South Africa, and we would disregard and discard completely the kind of plebiscitary democracy on which the Government is so keen.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as our young people are concerned too, we would hold out a completely different message for them. We will not try to isolate them from the rest of the world as far as cultural and other matters are concerned. We want them to he part of the world. We see our young people in South Africa richly endowed with idealism and they are so anxious to bring it into play. We would create a situation for them where they could do so, and is the fact that the young people of South Africa sit here on the back benches of our side not a visible manifestation of this? We invite them, Sir, and we give them an opportunity to help us to shape their own destiny. As far as the broader South Africa is concerned, we will restore to our people their pride in themselves and in their country. It is not nice for any South African to go around in the outside world and to be harassed wherever you go. At the moment when South Africans go abroad, all they have to do is to try to apologize for the stupidities of their own Government. Sir, that situation we must change and we will do so because we believe that South Africa is entitled to its rightful place in the sun. Above all else, what we will do is to create a new image, a new vision, a new set of values for South Africa. We will place hope where at the moment there is despair; we will have compassion where presently there is greed. We will substitute faith for fear. Mr. Speaker, I can only hope that the day will dawn soon when we on this side of the House will have an opportunity to put these and all the other many things that I cannot deal with now, into effect.</p>

<p>The Opposition has once again excelled itself here by failing to make any statement of a policy of their own. Sir, we have been sitting here for live months. The reporters in the Press gallery may judge on how many occasions in the course of those five months the Opposition has come forward with a statement of policy. A very serious question arises in this regard, and that is why this is so. Surely there must be a reason for it. I want to ask the English- language newspapers, which, after ail, are competent, too. to form an objective judgment in respect of these matters, whether they cannot carry out some investigation into these matters and determine why, session after session, the Opposition fails to state their policy here, is it because of the presence of a left or a right wing in the Opposition? Is it because of an inherent weakness and inability to analyze a matter to its core and to indicate a clear course? Is it because of an inherent weakness in the quality of the United Party members of the House of Assembly silting on that side? The English-language newspapers hinted in that direction when they wrote recently that all the United Party&#x2019;s ideas came from the newspapers and that very, very few ideas originated from those benches. Is that perhaps the reason? Sir, this is a serious question. Is it perhaps because of the lack of a leader with true vision? I do not know what the reason is. Is it perhaps because of the fact that Colin Eglin has appeared on the horizon now? Sir, they are going to have much difficulty with the Progressive Party in future, but I shall leave it at that. Is the reason perhaps that Prof. S. P. Cilliers and a few of those intellectuals are bringing so much pressure to bear on the Opposition that it is incapable of adopting a real standpoint on cardinal, burning issues in this country? I should very much like to know from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition whether, for example, he and his party accept or do not accept this scheme of Prof. S. P. Cilliers which has received such widespread publicity. We should very much like to know that. Will any of those hon. members please give us an answer?

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister&#x2014;you may consult Hansard if you wish&#x2014;devoted his entire speech in the debate on his Vote to the so-called urban Bantu. This was on 19th May. I made two speeches in that regard in this House&#x2014;Hansard is my witness&#x2014;and every word I spoke, was about the so-called urban Bantu. In the one speech I spoke about the question of transport and in the other speech I spoke about the question of national representative councils. In the debate on that Vote, I spoke about no other aspect but the so-called urban Bantu. Sir, the point I wanted to make is this: In this session of the House of Assembly the Opposition has not performed like a lion party; in fact, it has shown itself to be the scavenger party. In season and out of season it has acted like a hyena: this it did very well. In this regard the hon. the Leader of the Opposition set them a brilliant example. What happened in the debate on the Bantu Affairs Vote was in fact the best example of this, because after the debate on that Vote had been in progress for more than seven hours, and the lions had participated in it, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition rose here, ten minutes <span class="col_9111-9112" refersTo="page_1689"/>before the end of that debate, and made for the bones of that Vote like a hyena. Throughout this session we have found&#x2014; there are several examples of this&#x2014;that the Opposition has come here with a programme of character assassination and defamation on the Ministry and on virtually every member on this side of this House. [Interjections.] Sir, they can say what they like about it now, but this has been one of the features of this session.</p>

<p>When the dust of this session settles down, one thing will stand out as a mighty feature, and that is the brilliant performance our leader. Adv. Vorster, gave in the debate on his Vote; that will always stand out. Sir, as far as this aspect is concerned, I want to conclude by saying that as long as the Opposition cannot find a reason for its failure to put forward a policy, it may act as it did in this session, and it will have no future in South African politics.</p>

<p>Many other interesting things were revealed in the course of this session; it was the session in which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout distinguished himself here when he called the Immorality Act &#x201C;the pettiest of petty apartheid&#x201D;, and when he greatly embarrassed his Leader about the question of petty apartheid and its definition. This was the session in which the hon. member for Johannesburg North requested a referendum in Soweto. On what? On Bantu Administration in respect of the Bantu in White South Africa. I put very pertinent questions to the hon. the Leader about this matter and I do not want to repeat them now. To date, however, the hon. the Leader has not tried to reply to any one of those questions. Furthermore, this was the session in which the United Party conducted a long debate in the Other Place, and on what? As they expressed it: &#x201C;Give the Bantu labour force of South Africa voting rights in respect of these administration boards in White South Africa&#x201D;. This is the expression they used. This is the session in which the hon. member for Transkei moved the amendment in which he requested that the urban Bantu be given representation on these administration boards dealing with Bantu administration in White South Africa. Furthermore. this was the session in which it became very evident after the United Party&#x2019;s statement of policy in regard to sport, that the young members of the United Party outside were in favour of integration in sport from club level up to the top.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is true. It was reported like that in the newspapers and we know it. In this way the United Party has distinguished itself on these levels during this session. Now, however, also the question of the so-called urban Bantu, the Bantu in the White area, is a point at issue. I want to say at once that in respect of this matter, the National Party Government has always upheld a principle. What is this principle? This also provides the reason why the Opposition cannot come forward with a real policy. They do not have a principle. If they consulted a dictionary, they would see that a principle is defined as a basis, a fundamental source, a conviction of a fundamental truth. Our principle is very clear and the hon. member need not laugh. This is a very serious matter. Our principle is founded on the belief and conviction that the White people or nation in our multi-national country has the right to an identity of its own as, in fact, all other peoples have the right to an identity of their own, and consequently to a continued existence as a White people apart from the other peoples here.</p>

<p>This is our principle and in respect of this principle we have a policy. Policy is the science of government, and the establishment of a programme of action. For that reason it applies also to the implementation of this apartheid principle which determines the Government's strategy and its <i>modus operandi</i> with regard to the application of this fundamental principle for the maintenance of a separate White people. White South Africa is the only place in the whole wide world where a separate South African White people can be maintained. There is no other place. We want to carry this fundamental principle into effect under all circumstances.</p>

<p>Changed circumstances in respect of the policy bring about changes in approach, but never in principle. The way to maintain that principle in the light of changing circumstances and changing situations, is to determine the strategy or the policy by means of careful, circumspect, considerate and wise planning and action. The strategy must be revised from time to time and the programme of action must be adjusted. This is what is meant when it is said that in respect of the maintenance of this principle, the policy should be and is a flexible one. <span class="col_9113-9114" refersTo="page_1690"/>A policy in South African politics and also in the politics of any democratic country which does not have this quality and which does not make provision for an alternative action, if changed circumstances and situations demand it, is a useless piece of dead wood; this also applies to the apartheid policy in South Africa where we are competing with the master chess players of the world.</p>

<p>Having said this, I now come to the next point. In spite of the people of the Opposition and many uninformed people in South Africa, this Government is establishing a changed South Africa and creating a new dispensation in its dynamic third decade, to use the words of the hon. the Minister. In this dispensation, the question of the relations in South Africa between White and non-White, and not only with the Bantu, will be placed in a dimension from which we shall be able to continue looking forward more fruitfully to ever- improving relations in the Republic of South Africa. This is the most important guidance this Minister, our Prime Minister and the whole National Government on this side of this House are giving South Africa.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that because of the very fact that those hon. members are recognizing the first signs of this new dispensation, these changed circumstances which are developing with the creation of these improved relations of which I am talking, there are hon. members opposite who are recognizing the signs of the fruits of this, and that that is the Cause of a new sound we have heard from them this session. We have heard of a new sound from their side, against which we have warned very seriously&#x2014;I want to do so again this evening&#x2014;which I can describe in no other way than by saying that it is creating the impression that that side of this House is not even averse to calling in and involving non-Whites if only they can get rid of the National Government. They do not mind if in this process they cause misery in South Africa, if only they can succeed in their goal. Against the background of this mighty principle of the National Party and against the background of this programme of a policy which is flexible in order to create this new dispensation in South Africa, on which I want to elaborate now, the Opposition&#x2019;s programme is as clear as crystal: Slander and discredit the leaders on this side of this House into the ground. They obtained that advice from the Americans who were here. They are following it slavishly. One despises it with all one&#x2019;s heart. An Opposition which actually cannot do any better than that, is not worthy of even being called a good Opposition, let alone an alternative Government. In that respect I can honestly say that in that case one can even take the Progressive Party as an example. At least they have a policy and a principle: &#x201C;Equality in South Africa and everything it brings about in the process&#x2019;&#x2019;.</p>

<p>The second leg of their programme is also as clear as crystal to me. The first is &#x201C;discredit&#x201D; like the hyenas I mentioned earlier on. The other is to drag in everything which can possibly be dragged in&#x2014;it does not matter what the consequences are&#x2014; just as long as an early election can be forced on this country in an attempt to get rid of this Government in the climate they are trying to create in this process of discrediting It is impossible to rob a woman of her intuition, because it is an inborn characteristic. I believe as firmly that one cannot rob the people of South Africa of its inherent intuition either, so that it will be unable to see through this despicable action of the Opposition. Of this sort of action, we have never before in this House, and certainly not since I have been here&#x2014; and that is quite a few years&#x2014;had a more striking or better example than this morning from 10 o'clock to this evening at 10 o&#x2019;clock as that clock indicates. We could not possibly have had a more striking example! This has happened in spite of the fact that we on this side are engaged in matters of great magnitude, i.e. with the creation of a new dispensation in South Africa whilst we are competing against the master chess players of the world, a third dynamic decade, with deeds, with an exceptional network of transport which was announced on the Vote of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. A situation has now been created that in one single month more than 4 million daily trips are made between the homelands and the White area.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I have very little time at my disposal. In pursuance of what the hon. the Minister said here earlier this evening, I want to state our policy. It is very clearly based on a certain principle, while the United Party has no principle. I shall tell hon. members why the United Party has no principles. I listen very carefully when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition speaks. He speaks time and again of a community of South Africa, and then he includes Whites and non-Whites, that is to say, Whites, Coloureds, Bantu and Indian. He speaks time and again of South Africa as a plural society. It is on record that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said:</p>

<block name="quote">Up to now we have been inclined to speak of national unity only in regard to the two White sections of the population but it is quite clear that unless steps are taken to create a common patriotism among all sections of the population&#x2014;regardless of race&#x2014;we will never achieve unity and nationhood in the true sense of the word. It is tragic that all the signs point to a policy of the Nationalist Party which is not capable of creating a common patriotism but rather conflicting nationalisms among the sections of the population.</block>

<p>The point to which I should like to draw the attention of the hon. members is that it is very clear that the Opposition lump all the Bantu in the Republic of South Africa &#x2014;in the White area as well&#x2014;into one category. They then want to give those Bantu in White South Africa full rights. That at least is the direction in which they are moving, and this has also led to my mentioning these signs we have come across during this session of the House of Assembly. To test the morality of that is very easy. I want to do so by asking a number of questions. Since they do not want to lead the Bantu in the Bantu homelands to independence, we declare that we shall do it, and we are doing it in this third dynamic decade. We are creating a new dispensation in South Africa. We declare this and we are in earnest about it. What those hon. members do not realize is that they, as we are, are bound to the declaration of the Government that it is doing this. They will discover this in future if they are at present still too dense to do so The hon. members on that side of the House are not prepared to do so. Since this is the case, I want to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. They proceed from the assumption that Whites and Bantu in South Africa must have rights of citizenship here and that the Bantu must be a permanent part of the so-called community or plural society, call it whatever you like.</p>

<p>I want to put this question to the hon. the Leader, on the basis of morality, because the young people would like to hear the replies. They would like to hear these replies, because their future is very closely bound up with it. They want to know on what moral grounds and on what principle that party&#x2019;s policy is based. I want to allege that that party is lacking on that score, and that it has no such thing. I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to tell me in terms of his policy in respect of the Bantu in White South Africa whether he will accord the Bantu language its legitimate position alongside English and Afrikaans. Is he going to do that? Is he going to accord the Bantu language that recognition? If he does not, surely he cannot talk here about rights for the Bantu in White South Africa. Surely he is then merely saying things for the sake of piety. Whom can he convince on the grounds of principle if he sits there like a sphinx and does not even try to reply to a perfectly simple question?</p>

<p>I want to put a second question to him. The hon. members on that side are forever getting excited about labour in White South Africa. If those hon. members are honest in respect of the Bantu in South Africa, as we are with our creation of better attitudes, and that is what the future of the young people depends on, he will reply to this question. If the Bantu are to be part of the permanent plural society of White South Africa, are the Bantu able to make progress in the labour sphere until they attain their legitimate share to which they are after all entitled? Is he going to do that? After all, it is quite simple to answer yes or no, I now want to ask him: Would a <span class="col_9117-9118" refersTo="page_1692"/>Bantu be able to become a secretary of a department if he is regarded as a citizen of White South Africa? If he cannot, surely they are merely uttering pious platitudes and the young people cannot, surely, take any notice of them. If he cannot do that, surely they are dishonest, and the hon. members at the back there are the epitome of dishonesty, for where is their morality then? [Interjections.] Do not tell me where your morality is. Go out, tell the young people of South Africa, who want to know what the future holds for them. I say now that those young people would ten times rather listen to the Progressive Party, which at least has a principle, even if it is miles removed from the principles of the National Party.</p>

<p>No, I do not want to reply to questions now. My time is very limited. They are continually attacking us on this question, and then they say that we are running away from it Now you will see who is doing the running away. When I asked them a question in regard to languages, they were as silent as a tomb, Now I ask them: Can a Bantu become Secretary of the Department of Bantu Education in the Republic of South Africa? If they do not want to or cannot reply to that, surely they are like whited sepulchres. I ask again: Can a Bantu become a general in the South African Defence Force? Can he become commissioner of Police? Sir, I must be able to look a Bantu leader squarely in the face, and it does not make any difference whether that Bantu leader is in the homelands or in White South Africa. If I cannot look him squarely in the face, surely I am not a worthy White leader, and I am not even a worthy White citizen, for then I am cheating him, if I may use that word, Sir. This is what those hon. members have apparently never considered fully. We on this side of the House are honest with the Bantu&#x2026;</p>

They can only occupy those posts in the Bantu homelands. There they can become Prime Minister, of whom we already have eight, or they can become ministers, of whom we by now already have 50, and they can become secretaries of departments, of whom we also have more than 50.</p>

<p>That will come in time. [Interjections.] In their area it will still come. Sir, those hon. members simply do not understand the position. We are continually inviting them to come to the homelands to see what is going on there and to speak to the Bantu leaders so that they can convince themselves, because they are sitting there, and because they think that they can simply bluff the country even the English Press is beginning to despair. I quote from the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 26th April of this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One really does begin to despair of the United Party.</block>

<p>Sir, I am sorry I do not have the time to read this entire article, but it concludes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The trouble is that the United Party is restricted by a massive caution. It won&#x2019;t play bold strokes for fear of snicking the ball. Like a dull batsman it believes in the old catchphrase that if you just stay there the runs will come. That is all right if you are playing for your average, but if you are playing for power it does not do to bore the crowds.</block>

<p>It is not I who said this, Sir, it was the English Press. Over and against that we state our policy clearly and honestly. We <span class="col_9119-9120" refersTo="page_1693"/>say, on the basis of principle: A White cannot obtain any proprietary or political rights in the Bantu homelands; whether he was born there and whether he has lived there from the cradle to the grave, he cannot obtain those two kinds of rights there.</p>

<p>But they have.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No. The hon. the Prime Minister asked the hon. the Leader of the Opposition what his policy was in respect of proprietary rights and land in the Bantu homelands. I have his Hansard here and I can quote it. He then said that it was not his policy to change it. He elaborated on that and stated very clearly that he did not see his way clear to giving the Whites proprietary rights in a Bantu homeland. Sir, our policy is very clear. Why is he now making fish of the Whites and flesh of the Bantu? The Opposition does not want to give the Whites proprietary rights in the Bantu homelands, but it is in fact prepared to do so in the case of the Bantu in White South Africa. Surely that is dishonest and unfair. And what is the hon. the Leader of the Opposition doing? This is typical of the United Party. They are unscrupulous scavengers on the prowl for bones. They are not like lions devouring meat. They are not dealing with the major issues in the country to create a future which will allow the Black man, the While man, the Coloureds and the Indians to live in good relationships, and to create this for the future of our children; that hon. Leader turned round, and do you know what he then did? He turned round and accused us of estranging the Bantu in the White area. Nothing is further from the truth. If I had the time, I could prove to him chapter and verse that the Bantu not only accept this policy of ours with its opportunities and rights for them, but also how they are showing in an enthusiastic way and with feeling that they want to implement that policy themselves. I am sorry my time is running out. I have here the manifesto of the Urban Bantu Council of Ikageng at Potchefstroom. I just want to mention this one example. There are many others. I read an extract&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To fight for our children, to sleep at home and not in the town after work, because by sleeping there is where they do all kinds of mischief and misbehave themselves; to fight communism and agitators because we have no room for them here; to unite with our people in the homelands; to have a place somewhere in the homelands where we can buy our own ground to build a new township for our children as in 10 years&#x2019; time Ikageng will be over-populated and we do not want to turn our beautiful township into slums as in the olden days. And still we want peace and a good spirit between the Blacks and Whites with complete segregation in every department. Let us not be rolling stones but let us be like ants which prepared their food beforehand for rainy days.</block>

<p>This is a good relationship we are building up with the Bantu in South Africa. Why are those hon. members, for lack of principles and a policy, alleging that we are alienating the Bantu. Surely that is not fair. It is not fair to the Black man, and it is not fair to the White man either.</p>

<p>Our programme is clear and perfectly simple. Apart from the fact that the Bantu will be led to full independence, it is our programme to consolidate (he homelands as rapidly as possible, and to give economic substance as rapidly as possible to the political dispensation in the homelands. Our programme is in future to give these Bantu in White South Africa, in the absence of political rights, just as the Whites do not have political rights in the homelands just as the Whites do not have proprietary rights there, every possible security, the same security as the Whites have in the homelands. This includes the security of houses and the security of good wages. The question of wages is not only the task of the Government. Wages is a task for all of us to tackle. It is essential that the Bantu be paid good wages. They must receive wages according to merit. We will give them Police protection and help them in all possible respects. The Act which was piloted through Parliament this year in regard to the creation of greater labour mobility and the network of transport, etc., is geared at giving the Bantu in White South Africa those very facilities for which they have the greatest need, a sound, normal family life, as far as is possible, progress in life and that which makes of one a good human being. In this way we are creating good relationships in the Republic of South Africa in contrast to that party, which fall like hyenas on the bones. [Time expired.]</p>

The hon. the Deputy Minister must not come with character assassination stories. He must take his medicine. I want to take the hon. the Deputy Minister to task. While he was speaking I asked him whether he Would answer a question. He knows the question I was going to ask him. He boasts of four million journeys the Bantu make daily between their homelands and the so-called White urban areas. Will the hon. the Deputy Minister name those homelands? This is the third time this session I have asked him that question and he has not answered it yet.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Will the hon. the Deputy Minister tell us how many of these four million journeys are between Umlazi and Durban? How many of those journeys are between Mdantsane and <span class="col_9123-9124" refersTo="page_1695"/>East London? How many of them are between Imbali and Pietermaritzburg? How many of those journeys are between Ga Rankuwa and Pretoria, a distance of not more than four or five miles? These are homelands created artificially by this Government as a subterfuge to remove the Blacks from the White areas. That is all it is. Those are not homelands for the Bantu people.</p>

<p>Let us go one further with this hon. the Deputy Minister with his sanctimonious drivel. He says he is doing such wonderful things for the Bantu people. Will the hon. the Deputy Minister do the same for the Indians and the Coloureds? Can an Indian become a Prime Minister? Can a Coloured become the head of a department? Can an Indian become a general in the army? Can a Coloured become a Chief of Police? I think the hon. the Deputy Minister does not even want to take any notice. When he comes with all his sanctimonious nonsense and quotes from this letter about complete segregation, I want to ask him and his hon. Minister in front of him if they are prepared to face up to this criticism? It is quite apparent that he is not even prepared to listen. Is he prepared to stick to complete and total segregation? He has thrown that overboard long ago. He does not stand for complete segregation. Why does the hon. the Deputy Minister come and quote such a letter? I wonder how that letter finished off? Did it also ask for a petrol station or did it ask for a bottle-store, like the last one of which he read the last paragraph by mistake? Will he read the last paragraph of this letter too? But the biggest condemnation of this hon. Deputy Minister and his sanctimonious talk here tonight, was the report of the situation in which he and his Minister placed Chief Gatsha Buthelezi. This man, the leader of the Zulu people in this country, goes overseas as a specially invited guest and think of the embarrassing position that he is put in when he is asked over there whether he has met the Prime Minister of his country. This is the leader of an ethnic group created by this Government. This man has ashamedly to admit that he is ashamed to say that he has never met the Prime Minister of this country. Whose fault is it? It is the fault of that hon. Minister. I want to place on record that if it had not been for the efforts of my friend, the hon. member for South Coast, and myself, he would not even have met Chief Buthelezi.</p>

Unless we get a change of policy from the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, South Africa will shortly find itself&#x2014;and I say this advisedly&#x2014; with the most dreadful shortage of milk. We will shortly find ourselves in the position where all the milk produced in this country will have to be channelled to the urban areas to maintain the supply of fresh milk. This country could be wholly self-sufficient with regard to dairy products, but we will shortly find ourselves in a position where we will rely on the outside world for all dairy products apart from fresh milk. What has this Government done for the dairy industry? It has done absolutely nothing. If you look at the history of this industry, you will see that production has been controlled by this Government by manipulating price!!</p>
