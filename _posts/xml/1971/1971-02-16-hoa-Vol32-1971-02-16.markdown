<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this side of the House throughout yesterday afternoon argued on issues of fundamental importance to the security of South Africa&#x2019;s economy and, through that, to our national security. We argued on the relative merits of the &#x201C;demp&#x201D; policy as opposed to the &#x201C;growth&#x201D; policy in dealing with inflation. We dealt with questions affecting the whole field of financial mismanagement by this Government. And what happened, Sir&#x003F; Not only did the Government fail to give answers to our questions, but it was unable even to meet speaker with speaker. Towards the end of the afternoon we had the spectacle of the hon. member for Worcester entering the debate and making a speech which was no more and no less than a return to &#x201C;basterplakkaat&#x201D; politics, a speech going right back to the old tactics of the Nationalist Party which we know so well. But in regard to the issues raised by this side of the House there was not a single word, no short-term or long-term or any term at all policies in regard to economics. It is no wonder that the hon. the Minister of Finance, who is rumoured to want to retire, is unable to do so if that is the quality of financial economic thought on that side of the House. I want to bring the debate back to this, but before doing so I want to deal with one aspect.</p>

<p>Last night before the House adjourned I had quoted some of the statements made by the hon. member for Worcester when he spoke of the sabotage of the Afrikaner &#x2014;&#x201C;die Afrikanervolk gesaboteer&#x201D;&#x2014;and when he dealt with the &#x201C;onderploeging&#x201D; of the Afrikaner by immigrants. I want to add to that a passing expression used by the hon. member for Carletonville when replying to my hon. friend and colleague, the hon. member for Pinetown, when he said: &#x201C;Wei, ek ken die Rooitaal baie goed&#x201D;. I put this as part of an attitude, because that hon. member is an hon. member who, when he signed a hotel register in Nylstroom, gave his nationality not as South African but as &#x201C;Afrikaner&#x201D;. I know that, because I signed after him in that register and I signed it as a &#x201C;South African&#x201D;. But that hon. member does not consider himself a South African. He considers himself an Afrikaner and he talks of English as the &#x201C;Rooitaal&#x201D;. This shows that his mind rests in the dark depths of ancient history. Therefore I want to repeat my invitation to the hon. the Minister of the Interior, the great White hope of the Nationalist Party from Natal.</p>

<p>I will reply in my own good time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will enter this debate. We would like to see whether the light which he has brought to the Nationalist Party has not perhaps &#x201C;fused&#x201D;. If it has not fused, perhaps it has burnt out and he will find it <span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_0473"/>in &#x201C;Ashe&#x201D; at his feet. This is the theme which has been used in this debate and this is Nationalism as we know it. It is not a nationalism which has turned to the right, which has turned verkramp, but this is what nationalism is about. This is what it has always been about. There has been no swing to the right, but a return to traditional nationalism. That side of the House are attempting to distract attention from their failure to govern South Africa in the interests of all its people. So they drag these red herrings across the debate, bring in the racial issues and talk of the &#x201C;onder-ploeging van die Afrikaners&#x201D;. So they talk of all the things which, as they have found throughout the years, appeal to the emotions of people and sweep up political feeling. That is why there are constant efforts made in an attempt to persuade people that we on this side of the House want an unrestricted flow of Bantu labour into the cities. Because certain newspapers misreported what I said in a reply to an interjection to the hon. the Minister of Community Development, I want, for the sake of the record, to state our policy clearly. We believe in a stable family life for the Bantu. We believe that, as far as it is practical and possible, they should live with their families in the security of their homes. We have never said that we would abolish influx control and we have never said that there would be an uncontrolled flow. So, when the hon. the Minister interjected and asked me whether we would allow all the Bantu to have all their families here, my answer was &#x201C;no&#x201D;. I say that it is the policy of the United Party to allow this to the maximum practical extent.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to be diverted by the tactics of that side of the House in their continual attempt to drag in racial politics in order to mislead the people. I want to return to the theme of this debate as it proceeded throughout yesterday, flowing from the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s introductory speech, when he said that he wished to fight inflation by cutting down on spending power. So he brought into effect a sales tax which he says will bring in R47 million during a year and which will hit at every single citizen of South Africa, rich and poor alike. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not correct that only eight per cent of the people of South Africa pay income tax&#x003F; In other words, the Government itself considers that 92 per cent of the people of South Africa cannot afford to pay income tax. That is the Government&#x2019;s own analysis, not ours, because those are the facts. That is the level which it has laid down for the paying of income tax. So eight per cent pay the income tax which keeps the Government going.</p>

<p>Not eight per cent.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, eight per cent. Well, let the hon. members argue it. It is a small percentage of the total population of South Africa. But what about the 92 per cent who are being hit now&#x003F; They are told that they are overspending. I should like to ask the hon. members on that side of the House whether the old-age pensioner is spending too much&#x003F; Is he the cause of inflation, because he is overspending out of his miserable R35 per month, his disgraceful pittance which he receives as an old-age pension&#x003F; Is he contributing to inflation by overspending&#x003F; Is the man earning a disability grant, also a miserable R35 per month, the cause of inflation&#x003F; Is he overspending&#x003F; Is he pushing up prices&#x003F; Is the widow living on a fixed investment, the fixed investment saved by her husband during his working life, an investment reducing in value year by year, overspending and contributing to the inflation which faces us&#x003F; Are the Bantu workers, 80 to 90 per cent of whom are calculated to live below the subsistence line, overspending and so contributing to inflation&#x003F; Is the railway checker overspending on his basic salary of R160 with which he has to support his wife and children&#x003F; We will deal with that during the Railway debate.</p>

<p>However, is he the man responsible for inflation&#x003F; Are the tens of thousands of railwaymen who earn less than R200 per month, overspending&#x003F; Is it the family man who is overspending&#x003F; I want the hon. members on that side of the House to get up and say yes, the family man of South Africa is wasting his money, he is overspending. They are not overspending, they are battling to exist at all. They are battling to come out at all. They have to scrape and cut down in order to meet their expenses. Then they are told: No, you are spending too much. You must save. How do you save if you cannot even meet the bare essentials of living&#x003F; There is one way in which people can overspend, namely if they spend more than they earn through hire purchase or credit. What does the hon. <span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_0474"/>the Minister do in this regard&#x003F; He makes it easier to buy without money. He makes it easier to get into debt by relaxing hire purchase. This is the sort of logic you get from this Government. You must save, you must not spend so much, but I will make it easier for you to spend. I am only going to make it more expensive for you to buy the articles you need.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Do you want it stricter&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am talking about the illogicality of this Government. We have a simple solution to this. Our solution is growth, productivity. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s solution is to cut down, to restrict. The hon. the Minister wants to blunt the sword which will slaughter the dragon of inflation which he talked about. He wants to put a tip on the end so that it cannot strike home. We want to sharpen the sword, to make the knife stronger in this fight by increasing productivity, by using labour to its best possible extent to produce more and bring down prices that way, and not simply making it harder to buy.</p>

<p>Whom is the Government hitting&#x003F; It is not the rich man, the man who has the money to overspend. The man who has a Cadillac will make that Cadillac last another six months. He will make his wife wear a midi mink instead of a maxi mink if he has to. He is not the man that is being hit. He will only go half way round the world for his holiday instead of the whole way round. It is the ordinary man, the man who is battling today, who is being hit. He is not just being hit to the extent the hon. the Minister has announced, namely for R47 million, but much more.</p>

<p>I want to give a simple example of an item which costs R1 at source in the factory. For argument&#x2019;s sake assume the hon. the Minister has raised the tax by 10 per cent to 30 per cent. The public are given to believe that they are now paying 30 per cent tax, which of course is not true. At source this product now costs R1.30 instead of R1 and when the wholesaler has added his 20 per cent profit, which he has to have because he has to finance the tax, and because he has to finance the goods, that 130 cents has become 156 cents. Let us assume now that that profit has a 50 per cent profit margin which is not excessive, because the retailer has to carry stock, he has to finance the stock and he has to finance his customer. So, the item of R1.56 becomes R2.34. If there were no tax the price from the wholesaler would have been R1.20 and the price from the retailer would have been R1.80. Therefore, instead of that item costing R1.80, it is now not going to cost R2.10, but R2.34. This means that the purchaser has to pay 54 per cent extra when he buys this item. This is a hidden burden which is being laid on the people of South Africa and the Government talks blithely of R47 million. They are going to take far more than R47 million from the housewives of South Africa. They are at least going to take half of that again and then they shrug their shoulders and say &#x201C;we only taxed you R47 million&#x201D;.</p>

<p>My colleague from Gardens referred to something I have raised before in this House. He referred to the hidden taxation which people are paying to the Government. How many members who are smokers have looked at their cigarette boxes lately and have noticed that for some time no amount of tax is shown on the tax stamp which is stuck onto the cigarette box&#x003F; One used to look at it and then you saw the amount you were paying in tax. Today, because it is &#x201C;administratively more convenient&#x201D;, they do not show it any more. The public do not know what they are paying, because it is politically expedient for the Government to hide what the man in the street is paying to this Government for its mismanagement. I challenge the hon. the Minister and the Government to disclose to the people of South Africa what they are in fact paying by having a sticker on each item. Then, if he drinks a beer, he will know that he is paying more tax on that beer than he is paying the breweries for making that beer. Then, when he smokes his cigarette, his luxury which he is enjoying, he knows what amount of the price he is paying is for tax. Then, when a housewife powders her nose she will see every time she opens the box of powder, what she is paying to this Government in order to enjoy the modern amenity of cosmetics.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister repeated in this debate that he was taxing durable and luxury items as far as possible&#x2014;durable items like toilet paper and baby powder. These are the items which he considers durable and luxury items. So I have looked at some of these items. Once before I described what one would have to look like if one were not to pay the tax. Since that <span class="col_923-924" refersTo="page_0475"/>time, however, we have had an increase of taxation. I want to deal with a statement which was made by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. He told us in the no-confidence debate that the reason why the Government is not taxing caravans is because so many people are living in caravans. It is because the Minister sitting next to him cannot provide the houses for the people of South Africa. He cannot provide the houses, so his colleague next door says &#x201C;did we not notice that caravans are not being taxed&#x201D;. But caravans have now been taxed with an additional tax, bringing the total to 20 per cent. The hon. the Minister of Finance said that they are not taxing housing, clothes and food. Yet he taxes caravans by 20 per cent, and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs says that people are living in caravans &#x201C;by hulle duisende&#x201D;, to use his exact words. This is something the public should know about this Government. They should know, and it is not our claim but that of the Government, that thousands of people are living in caravans and that these are now taxed.</p>

<p>But let us look at the home which is not being taxed. If the hon. the Minister of Community Development would talk less and give us a few more houses and keep down the cost of housing, he would be getting somewhere. I want to ask him whether he has pleaded with the hon. the Minister of Finance. To paint a house costs 15 per cent extra at source, which means that the buyer pays 25 per cent by the time it reaches the shop. If one wants to put wallpaper on walls instead of paint it costs 15 per cent more and 25 to 30 per cent by the time one buys it in a shop. If you want a bath plug or a basin plug you have to pay a tax on that as well. If you want to buy utensils for your house you have to pay a tax of 15 per cent on them. If you want to stock your house with crockery, cutlery, a stove, a refrigerator, furniture and everything else you need for a house the tax is higher as announced in the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s Budget Speech on Wednesday. Again I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Community Development what plea he made to the hon. the Minister of Finance to remove these taxes from the person wanting to build a house. He said that every young married couple had a house. Does he still say so&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a housing unit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister says that every young couple has a housing unit. We will come back to that. It is on record that the hon. the Minister said that every young couple has a housing unit. But that Minister has done absolutely nothing to keep the cost of these housing units down while his colleague taxes them.</p>

<p>The Government does not tax clothes, but they tax the mother who wants to make clothes for her children because she cannot afford to buy ready-made clothes. The true South African mother who tries to follow the South African tradition, tries to clothe her family herself. The Government therefore taxes her sewing machine, her knitting needles and her thimble. In effect they say to her that she must go and buy her clothes in a shop because they are not interested in her trying to keep down costs by clothing her family herself. I am not even going to deal with taxes as far as children and babies are concerned, on toys and everything else needed to bring up a family. We on this side of the House have also dealt with the question of motorcars which are an essential item to so many people today. The Government has taxed one good thing, however. It has taxed cheque-writing machines, especially chequewriting machines that write out cheques for R7&#x00BD; million to Agliotti &#x2026;</p>

<p>I feel very strongly about my next point. Last year the hon. the Deputy Minister, in reply to questions in this House, stated, and it is on record in Hansard, that it was impossible for him to exempt poppies sold on Armistice Day from taxation. We pleaded with the hon. the Deputy Minister. He said that it could not be done and we said that it could. We have now been proved right and I hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will get up and apologise to the memory of those whose memory he allowed to become subject to taxation last year. I repeat that the people of South Africa should know what they are paying for this Government and not just to this Government. They are paying for it in Bantustans, the concept of independent states. They are paying for a divided Government, a party divided against itself, a party of division and confusion, a party without leadership within its own ranks, trying to lead South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister sits there with a team which he knows has deeply divergent views, views which he cannot reconcile. We are entitled to say that this is part of the cause of the price which the people of South Africa are <span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_0476"/>paying for this Government. This is part of the cause of the blunders which are being made day after day&#x2014;the wastage of taxpayers&#x2019; money, of your and my money and, above all, the contempt for the ordinary person struggling to make a living today. If those hon. members do not know about it, they have no contact with their constituents. They have no contact with their own people if they do not know the struggle which so many South Africans today are having, simply to make ends meet. If they do not know what they are having to sacrifice, they have lost touch with the people of South Africa. That is why we condemn this demand for more money to be taken from the people who can least afford to pay it.</p>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Reference is being made here to the fact that I was a candidate for the leadership in the Free State. I just want to remind hon. members that in the Free State we have a democratic election of leaders, and not the kind the United Party sometimes has.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Point is one of the foremost speakers on the Opposition side, but unfortunately he has another quality. He is one of the foremost clowns on their side. Now I have a great deal of sympathy with him in that connection. He must always keep his standard high. Unfortunately, however, he becomes a little tedious as far as I am concerned. In particular I want to refer to the attacks made on the hon. member for Worcester, a man who has balance and self-control and whose words he distorted here in order to present him as a racialist. I also want to mention his humourless reference to the hon. member for Carletonville, a man who is known for the fact that each year in this House, out of respect for the English language, he makes a speech in English. Now he is also being referred to as a kind of racialist. But as one of the prominent speakers on the Opposition side, and that in a financial debate, the hon. member for Durban (Point) could at least ensure that when he makes important statements they have something of a factual basis. He told us here that 8 per cent of the population pays income tax in the country. It is much nearer the truth, in fact it is the truth, that 90 per cent of the population pays 41 per cent, 9.2 per cent pays 35 per cent and,0.8 per cent pays 24 per cent of the taxes. I now want to tell the hon. member that in future he should do a bit of checking on his facts beforehand and not think that he is dealing with a lot of children in this House. After having listened for several hours to Opposition speakers, or rather &#x201C;prophets of doom&#x201D;, it is clear why they have been wandering around in the political desert for 23 years already, without any prospect whatsoever of reaching the political promised land in the foreseeable future. Their approach to the financial problems of our country is negative and destructive; they do not make positive suggestions and do not suggest any <i>modus operandi</i> that is based on fixed and well-considered principles. In short, their approach is one of the cheap incitement of emotions. We have just had an example of that. Fortunately we have a level-headed electorate and the Opposition will therefore not easily succeed in their endeavours.</p>

<p>They make a great fuss about the R47 million that the hon. the Minister wants to collect with an increased sales duty. Then again they object to the fact that for the first time in history the hon. the Minister has instituted the additional levy by way of a Little Budget. But it is surely a recognized way of doing things in quite a number of Western countries for the Minister of Finance to increase or to decrease taxation by between 5 and 10 per cent without pre-notification and without previous Parliamentary approval. Why do they then regard it as unreasonable for this Minister to come to Parliament first, even though it is during the Little Budget and ask for the levy of such additional taxation&#x003F; This is, after all, the proper time for damping excessive consumer spending, and at the same time reassuring importers about import control, thereby avoiding unnecessary stockpiling and consequent pressure on our balance of payments. This Opposition, which is now making such a fuss about the sales duty, is the same Opposition that has for years been advocating this system of taxation in order to iron out the so-called &#x201C;bulge&#x201D;. Their main objection now is that this taxation is not being applied with sufficient selectivity, and that it involves too many products that the middle and lower-income groups must buy. As far as I can see, however, this taxation is being kept within the limits of the Franzen Commission recommendations. This commission <span class="col_927-928" refersTo="page_0477"/>recommended a sales duty that would not be applicable to food, clothing, footwear, cost of accommodation, health items and certain excisable goods. In my opinion the Government is confining this taxation to within the limits of the Franzen Commission recommendations. We know that White families with an income of less than R2,000 a year spend 64.2 per cent of the family budget on food, rental, payments on dwellings, insurance, repair and maintenance costs to dwellings, water, petrol, lights, clothing and footwear. Few of these articles are included among those on which a sales duty is being levied. Inevitably there are, however, items that do affect the lower-income group. On the other hand, however, we find that the sales tax on so-called luxury articles is now being pushed up to the maximum, i.e. 30 per cent, the maximum that is economically justified. We must remember that the businesses that are handling these goods, such as jewellers and fur dealers and producers, have a large number of employees that could be without employment if the sales tax on these goods were too high and the articles were consequently unpurchasable.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the main speaker on the Opposition side tried to make an issue of the position of pensioners and newly married couples. But is it not this Government which annually increases old age and other pensions and makes literally millions of rands a year additionally available to these people&#x003F; Proper account is taken of the fact that these people have small and modest incomes and that the cost of living affects them most acutely. As far as newly-weds are concerned, I can say, without fear of contradiction, that no generation in our country has had a better time of it as specifically this present young generation. It is true that their costs are increasing, in some cases perhaps even to a disturbing extent, but they nevertheless enjoy a level of income and a standard of living today which is unprecedented in history. In order to keep wives in the labour market, particularly the newly married ones, ample tax concessions are being made to married people, particularly newly married couples. Those of us who matriculated in the &#x2019;thirties, or even in the &#x2019;forties, sometimes stand amazed at the high standard of living of these school leavers, students and newly-weds of today, while we as newly-weds could not even own a motorcar and had to save for many years before we were able to do so. Today, however, it is general for school leavers, students and newly-weds to accept a motorcar as an essential item. I do not, of course, want to be misunderstood, because I do not begrudge the young people of today the affluence they are enjoying, but then they must also take into account that they are enjoying a higher standard of living, and they should not succumb to the crocodile tears the Opposition is shedding over them today. One matter is as plain as a pike staff&#x2014;that in spite of the increase in the cost of living, salaries and wages are at all times increasing more rapidly. But this is a fact which the Opposition does not even mention obliquely in order to give a balanced picture of the whole matter of the cost of living. On the contrary, the Opposition is just constantly singing us dirges about the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an additional fact about which the Opposition keeps silent from start to finish, in its financial attacks on the Government, is that the Government is primarily and directly responsible for the most important element of progress and growth, i.e. the creation of a stable government which is maintaining the country&#x2019;s safety for its multi-national development. Since 1960 there have been exoduses, from more than 26 countries of Africa, of millions of people who had to leave the countries because of civil war, unrest and persecution. Throughout this entire period, in this country of ours on the southern tip of Africa, there has been only safety and prosperity, for which a strong Government can be thanked. What would have happened if the United Party had been in power&#x003F; They would still have been busy at this time with court cases against the first communists they wanted to eliminate.</p>

<p>Sir, in addition I should like to express my joy to the hon. the Minister of Finance for a recent statement to the effect that he is going to have good news in connection with estate duty. I trust that when his announcement actually comes&#x2014;and obviously I do not expect any announcement or reaction from him now&#x2014;it will indeed bring great relief to farmers and certain other owners of property. Sir, we are living in a time of tremendous and even artificial appreciation of land values. This means that landowners, who would not have been regarded as very wealthy a number of years ago, are now regarded as wealthy and very wealthy. I want to mention the example of a farmer who is today regarded as wealthy and even as very wealthy. If he has only <span class="col_929-930" refersTo="page_0478"/>four children and those four children were to inherit from him, those four children would inherit only economic units and, as the Act reads at present, it could be that the State and the children are taxed with estate duty they can perhaps ill afford. Such cases will, according to my own personal opinion, have to be exempted from at least estate duty if such an announcement does come.</p>

<p>In addition I want to call upon the hon. the Minister to continue his endeavours to increase the income tax rebate per child, in order to encourage a wealth of children in White families. You will remember, Sir, that the Franszen Commission regarded the matter as so serious that they also made a specific recommendation about it.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say something about the price of products. I particularly want to do this because the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 12th February of this year also made pessimistic predictions about this question. With reference to the expected good maize crop it stated, <i>inter alia:</i></p>

<block name="quote">On the other hand, however favourable from the private sector&#x2019;s point of view, better agricultural prospects may be, they create monetary problems for Dr. Diederichs and the pundits in Church Square.</block>

<p>That is the typical attitude of this journal. If the farming sector were also to be favoured by weather conditions and by Providence, and if only one industry, for example the maize industry, were this year to ensure R150 million and more in foreign exchange, then there are again prospects of an overflow of money coming in from the farming sector, and there will be many problems. To the hon. the Minister and the authorities concerned I particularly want to say this in respect of the maize industry and ask them about it. It is the one exceptional year in which most maize farmers can share in the prosperity of a good crop. In many, perhaps in the majority of cases, a good income is urgently needed in order to pay debts to other sectors. As public servants and other employees have just recently, and rightly so, received good increases, in spite of inflation, I ask that magnanimity should likewise be displayed when fixing this year&#x2019;s maize prices and the prices of other farming commodities.</p>

<p>I have now listened to the hon. member for Kroonstad, who said that he had lost his leadership in the Free State on a democratic basis, and I want to say that the hon. member made a few points that I want to come back to. But first I should like to deal with the point with which I agree and that is, as a matter of fact, a matter in which we have been taking the lead for a long time, the question of estate duty. I agree with him, of course. It is not the first time this House has listened to that, but the difference is just this. That matter has for a long time now been a matter of policy for the United Party, but for that member and his Party it is no more than an expectation. I hope that his hopes will not be dashed.</p>

<p>The hon. member says that my colleague, the hon. member for Durban (Point), is a clown and he also says the hon. member has no sense of humour. I would never say that the hon. member for Kroonstad has no sense of humour, but if he does have one he hides it very well. Sir, the hon. member for Durban (Paint) is no clown.</p>

<p>If the hon. member wants to regard the matter, which was put forward, as clowning, he may do so, but then I also want to tell the hon. member that he is trying to be funny about the needs of the people of South Africa; and if the hon. member thinks it is funny for one to speak of poverty and people who are experiencing difficulties, let him continue with pleasure. I have no doubt in my heart that some time or other the people will square accounts with him. The hon. member for Kroonstad asks how we can speak of only 8 per cent of the people who pay taxes. But very clearly my hon. Leader was referring to people paying direct income tax, and surely not indirect income tax, because indirect taxes are applied whether one has an income or not. [Interjection.] And there the figure of 8 per cent stands unassailed. I am satisfied in saying that in no debate so far has anyone yet attacked it, except the humorous member for Kroonstad. Then he also had something to say about the R47 million, and we are supposedly upset at the fact that it was introduced in an abnormal manner. <span class="col_931-932" refersTo="page_0479"/>I do not care what happens abroad in this respect, but I do want to tell the hon. member that in South Africa it is abnormal, and I think he will agree. And if he agrees, I ask him whether it is right to say that the hon. the Minister found himself in an abnormal position in the South African economy&#x003F; It is therefore a more serious position than he and I would like to believe. And if the position is not serious, it becomes a still uglier matter for me because no Minister of Finance ought to find it in his heart to tax the people to the tune of R47 million unless there is really a state of emergency. R47 million is in no way a trifling matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) made other important points. These are points with which the hon. member for Kroonstad should not have had any problems. He spoke of the fact that today the taxpayer is expected not only to pay direct purchase tax, but also to pay tax on tax. As a result of that fact we hear &#x201C;zip&#x201D;, not a word, from the hon. member for Kroonstad. It seems to me that with all his financial knowledge that hon. member has never yet discovered that fact. This afternoon I want to ask him in all seriousness whether he does not think it time for us to reveal this fact to the South African people&#x003F; Is it not time for the people to know what they are paying by way of indirect taxation&#x003F; Only recently I studied the figures and was upset to see how the indirect income tax had increased over the last 10 to 12 years. In fundamental principles one is not against indirect taxation, but where we are dealing with a people such as the people of South Africa, where there is a tremendous mass of people on the bottom edge of the income bracket with, relatively speaking, a few on the top, as far as the income limits are concerned, it is my belief&#x2014;for what it is worth&#x2014;that indirect taxation is the heaviest taxation that could possibly be imposed in this country. It should consequently be imposed with the greatest care and circumspection. I really do not believe that the hon. the Minister took the needs of the South African population into consideration in applying this tax as he has done. It is time that the South African people knew what it is costing them to keep the Nationalist Party in power.</p>

Do hon. members still recall how the people were told they must make sacrifices for separate development&#x003F; Today it is not said that the sacrifices are for separate development, but indirectly that is surely the case. It is necessary for us to tell the people that they are making sacrifices for an unattainable ideal. That is our problem.</p>

<p>Let me come back and quickly refer to the hon. member for Worcester. If the hon. member for Worcester proved anything irrefutably, it is that the Nationalist Party longs for the past with a burning heart. They are afraid of the times we are living in. They are afraid of the problems modern South Africa is faced with, and they are afraid to face up to the problems and overcome them. They long for the time when they could simply shout &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; and all the walls fell down. If we only give them half a chance they would fight the Anglo-Boer all over again. They long for the time when they could say there was no place at all for an Afrikaner in the United Party.</p>

<p>No, the hon. members have it wrong. Their accusation is wrong, it ought to be O.B. I just want to explain to hon. members, as I have done before. The hon. the Prime Minister was also an O.B. The difference is that I saw the light, while he did not. When I tried to put right what he and I had botched up, he continued to make a mess of things. That is the whole difference. I speak of the hon. the Prime Minister with the greatest respect. I am just mentioning the facts as I see them. The hon. members in this House forget that we are dealing with a new era and a new South Africa. There were times when we laughed at Macmillan when he said that the winds of change were blowing over Africa. I want to say today that the winds of change have also blown over South Africa, and it has not left the people of South Africa altogether untouched either. Today the Nationalist Party is just as out of fashion as a mini-dress, and just like the wearers of the mini they do not realize it. The people of today&#x2014; and it is high time that we stopped and viewed them with all seriousness&#x2014;are finished with the slogans of the past. I am speaking of the modern people who have <span class="col_933-934" refersTo="page_0480"/>put off childish ways. These modern South Africans are finished with the slogans of the past, and the Nationalists cannot catch them with that any longer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the new South African people, if I may use the term &#x201C;new&#x201D;, are aware of their own potential as a people. They are aware of the potential of modern South Africa. These people demand that the potential of South Africa be properly developed and controlled, so that they will be able to reap the benefits of the consequent prosperity. The people of South Africa also know that if the potential of this country is properly developed, it will ensure a decent living to every person in this country. As far as these strivings and this proper development is concerned, in all these aspects the Nationalist Party is failing the people. That is why the people are leaving that Party. The people are no longer looking for a solution on the basis of separate development. It has failed. The people know this.</p>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance. The people are looking for a solution to our race problems, a solution based on the facts as they are. The hardest and most irrefutable fact of modern South Africa is that the Whites and the Bantu are here, and that they will remain here. They are both pushing the economic machine. The people of South Africa are seeking a solution on the basis of these facts alone.</p>

<p>May I also say that it would be wrong to speak about the modern people of South Africa as a materialistic people, a heartless people. But these people realize, unlike the Nationalist Party, that if the Whites in the first place want to hold their own, and in the second place want to do their civilizing duty towards the non-Whites in South Africa, it has become time for them to develop themselves to the utmost and make themselves prosperous so that they and the other people of South Africa can share in the wonderful prosperity of the country. It is my belief that as long as the Whites carry a fear of the non-Whites in their hearts they will not be able to do their civilizing duty towards those people.</p>

<p>Your party is placing them on that road of fear.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, the only way that fear can be eradicated is by making the people prosperous and by filling them with confidence in themselves. That is why the people are turning against the Nationalist Party, because that party believes in &#x201C;rather poor but White&#x201D;. And the people reply to the Nationalist Party: &#x201C;No, not rather poor but White; we are White but we do not want to be poor&#x201D;. That is what the people are saying. The United Party says &#x201C;Yes, the people are right&#x201D;. Not preferably poor but White, rather prosperous and White. It is South Africa&#x2019;s right. Because the Nationalist Party is not giving what the people are looking and asking for, we find a nation-wide call for development, growth and production. That is the matter which the hon. member for Parktown clarified the other day. What is the reply of the Nationalists when we say that there must be development, growth and greater production. Then the Nationalist Party says: &#x201C;No, damp, put the pot&#x2019;s lid on&#x201D;. That is what they are doing. They are deaf to the appeals of the people. Never in our history, as far as I can remember, has there been such a general request to this Government, right across the party lines, to produce. Here I have a newspaper, i.e. <i>Rapport. Rapport</i> states here openly that it has no faith that these steps of the hon. the Minister will combat inflation. Not only <i>Rapport</i> but all thinking bodies, with a few exceptions, support this side of the House today in its view that the answer is to be found in higher productivity. Neither the hon. the Minister, nor his Party, is giving any attention to that, and they are simply going on right across the party lines. Then we hear from the hon. member for Worcester that money has become a god for us if we speak in these terms. For the United Party prosperity is not an end in itself, but it is a means to an end, and the object we want to serve is the proper development and realization of these fine South African <span class="col_935-936" refersTo="page_0481"/>people. That is what money would give us. [Interjections.] I have no problems with that at all. Then may I also just tell the hon. member that if he says to us that money is our god, and that is something I would never address to him, because I think it unworthy of any member to say such a thing, I just want to tell him that he is making an idol of his ideology, which forms the basis of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s conduct. I want to tell the hon. member that the Nationalist Party is hobbling and shackling the people of South Africa as the result of an ideology. I am satisfied that the people who think about these matters, and who perhaps have a little more knowledge of economics than the hon. member for Worcester has of politics, agree with me. Now the question crops up about where we are doing the over-spending. They say &#x201C;high spending&#x201D; and &#x201C;high living&#x201D; and &#x201C;too high salaries&#x201D; are causing it. I am looking for the people who are doing this spending. It is surely not the &#x201C;mink and Mercedes set&#x201D; of Pretoria, or is it&#x003F; Are they the ones who are spending in this way&#x003F; I do not have any of them in my constituency, and if I do it is in very small measure. The hon. the Minister and his colleagues should, and I say it with all respect, now and then leave the main roads of old Cape Town&#x2014;they can still drive around in the same motorcars&#x2014;and venture down into the lesser known byways of the city. There they must see how the people live who are so dear to their hearts. Where are the people who earn so much money and who are wasting so much of it&#x003F; Are they the 92 per cent who do not even pay direct income tax&#x003F; Are they the young couples who are now being requested to pay tax on their furniture, their stoves and on nearly everything they want&#x003F; Is this the way we want to encourage young families&#x003F; Then the hon. member says yes &#x2026;</p>

The modern people of South Africa have developed their own needs and necessities, and no party in this country will turn them from those needs. Unfortunately the hon. the Minister of Agriculture is not here at present, but nothing struck me so forcibly as the effect which the increase in the price of bread had on the average man. In this hon. House we can sit back and tell ourselves that we do not need to eat bread today, because it is not good for our diet, but in the homes of thousands and tens of thousands bread is one of the most basic of foodstuffs.</p>

Those very same members who are sitting over there today, who were in power at that time, almost before the rinderpest, are at present walking about with a loaf of white bread under each arm, and then they have the temerity to complain here about the present situation. They complain about housing. But when they had to provide housing in those days&#x2014;when the hon. the present Minister of Community Development was still on their side, on the wrong side, as he himself says today-&#x2014;I still had to queue, four years after I got married, in order to see unsympathetic people of the United Party. There was not even a flat available, not even in Jeppes, which used to be a slum area. Therefore, what right do they have today to complain about a housing shortage&#x003F; Then they talk about barbecues, but they can be grateful that there is meat for having barbecues. Four years after I got married, in 1950, I was able to buy mutton for the first time, at a tennis function.</p>

<p>A very intelligent question, Mr. Speaker. They gave their sheep to their political associates, those imperialists who, in their ships, called here at our ports. That is where our meat went to. How often did my dear wife not have to join a meat queue at 4 o&#x2019;clock in the morning, only to get a small portion of meat&#x003F; Who are they to level criticism today&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland said that in our hearts we feared the non-Whites. But let me tell that poor hon. member that there has never been any fear in the <span class="col_941-942" refersTo="page_0484"/>hearts of Nationalists, neither in the hearts of their ancestors, nor in the hearts of their descendants. Let me tell the hon. member what is to be found in the heart of the Nationalist&#x2014;faith, a thing about which hon. members opposite know very little.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the basic things, and the people of South Africa expect the Opposition to be responsible enough to know something about these basic things. One basic aspect is the economic situation in South Africa at present. Now, we must relate this to the ideologies of the respective parties in South Africa&#x2014; the National Party, the governing party, on the one hand and, on the other hand, the United Party. They want to solve all economic problems in South Africa today by means of an instant recipe, an instant injection&#x2014;just give it more non-White labour and then the whole situation will have been solved. But they have never calculated what this is going to cost, and they do not care what the consequences of such a step are going to be. They could not care less about those things. As against that the National Party has now been governing the country for 23 years, and it can look back with pride on a very successful 23 years. Of course, there have been problems, as there are also today. But it met every problem as it cropped up and solved it for the good of South Africa&#x2014;not for the good of a political party, but for the good of the Whites of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, in the course of the no-confidence debate here the hon. member for Lydenburg made certain elementary calculations for the benefit of the United Party, which has been pleading here for the continual addition of non-White labour to the labour market. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition pleaded for a very high growth rate. He thought of Japan and referred to I do not know how many per cent, but he mentioned terrible percentages here. The hon. member for Lydenburg took a few percentages and calculated that a growth rate of 8.4 per cent per year would bring about for South Africa additional capital and investment requirements to the amount of R3,384 million. The Opposition, the United Party, has never told us where they want to get this money from. Do they want it from Zambia or from Red China or perhaps from Russia or from Israel or from Great Britain or from America&#x003F; Where are they going to get it from&#x003F; They have never told us. The United Party went out of its way to quote so-called well-meaning Afrikaans business leaders in order to criticize us. I want to say straight away that the National Party, unlike the United Party, grants every right-minded South African the right to level criticism and to make a positive contribution to the progress and development of South Africa.</p>

<p>It does not matter whether they criticize; they are still Nationalists. They have not joined the United Party as yet. They are helping to develop South Africa. But in contrast to that I now want to tell hon. members of the United Party what their people are saying. At the end of my quotation I shall say who this person is. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We all live beyond our means. We all have a propensity to consume more than we produce. And the marvel of consumer credit permits us to do it quite easily, allowing us to mortgage future earnings against present enjoyment.</block>

<p>This is a truth, as the hon. member for Carletonville also said. This person went on to amplify his argument, and at the end &#x2014;and this is what I find so striking and important&#x2014;he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a psychological problem&#x2014;a question of attitudes, as much as it is an economic matter. It is difficult to see South Africans voluntarily making the sacrifices of effort and self-denial which, in the end result, are the only possible answers to inflation. Perhaps they will have to be imposed upon us, either by the hidden forces of economics or by State action.</block>

<p>&#x201C;State action&#x201D;, which is what the hon. the Minister is taking at present&#x2014;that R47&#x00BD; million on which the Opposition is harping to such an extent. Who said this, Sir&#x003F; It was said by Stephen Mulholland in &#x201C;This is the Business&#x201D; in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 24th January, 1971&#x2014;only the other day. This is the person I am now quoting against them, and this is a person who will never vote anything but U.P. or Progressive. He said that the State should take action in this respect, and the State is doing so. <span class="col_943-944" refersTo="page_0485"/>Sir, I could quote on and on. They quoted our newspapers, our authors and our supporters. Here we have Dr. Etienne Rousseau, who, in <i>Die Transvaler</i> of Monday, 1st February&#x2014;i.e. two weeks ago&#x2014; said these words, which also constituted the heading of the article, &#x201C;Extravagance and High Demands are a new Evil&#x201D;. It is against these things that the National Party and the Government are taking steps. Sir, I could go on quoting because I have many quotations here, but I shall content myself with these.</p>

<p>Here I have the New Year message of the President of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut; it is the message for this year, not for last year (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the new year that lies ahead South Africa will have to take positive steps to ensure that, by way of hard work, self-discipline, the more effective utilization of labour&#x2026;</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I shall come back to the question of the more effective utilization of labour&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; increased productivity and positively increased savings, the required real growth, at an economically acceptable rate of inflation, is brought about if the Republic wants to bring about a sound economy in the seventies and a high real prosperity for all its inhabitants. This ideal can only be realized if, in the new year and in the decade of the seventies, every South African in every walk of life makes it his slogan and life&#x2019;s ideal to work harder and more productively in the interests of South Africa and the prosperity of us all.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville, who is sitting in that front bench all by himself, referred to labour while I was quoting Mr. Ben Marais, the President of the S.A. Handelsinstituut. What does the United Party want to accomplish with its labour policy&#x003F; I should like to illustrate this to you, Sir, in the following manner. Here we have the labour ladder of the National Party. That labour ladder is a ladder of White workers. Here we have the ladder of the non-White workers. Every labourer can, on his own ladder, go up to the maximum. But what does the United Party want&#x003F; The United Party says there is a White ladder, and the non-Whites will be pushed in from the bottom, and who of them can guarantee that the Whites will not be pushed down at the top&#x003F; That is the trouble with their policy. That is also the trouble with their political policy. In the process of integration which they are in actual fact advocating, they have no interest in the Whites, or in their future, or in their continued existence. They are merely concerned about their own political success, and as for the rest, they do not care about South Africa, its Whites or even its non-Whites. The United Party is not only doing itself a disfavour; it is doing the whole of South Africa a disfavour. Here we have a situation of inflation, which we all admit. It is a situation with which the world, including South Africa, has to contend, but what has been the United Party&#x2019;s contribution to this debate and what was their contribution to the no-confidence debate&#x003F; They have been defending injudicious extravagance. Here the motorcar of inflation is in the process of running away. They want to chase it in a production motorcar. The inflation motorcar is going downhill. They do not care about the abyss that lies ahead. The National Party wants to brake that inflation motorcar, but they want to race that inflation motorcar, the motorcar of rising prices, into the abyss and also destroy themselves in that process. They stand for an uncontrolled &#x201C;spending spree&#x201D; in South Africa. We are asking that the public of South Africa&#x2014;not only the Whites but also the non-Whites&#x2014;should, in its own interests, work harder and be more productive and save more, for out of savings future prosperity is born. The United Party has failed in its function as an Opposition&#x2014;if not entirely, definitely to a large extent&#x2014;because they have not joined us in appealing to the inhabitants of South Africa to assist in squashing this inflation monster. No, they are fighting every measure taken by the Government. They are casting suspicion on every measure taken by the Government. They are ridiculing the Government&#x2019;s measures, and in that respect they have the whole-hearted support of the loyal Press that supports them. Sir, one grants them the right to criticize, but South Africa and its people will most definitely not grant them for ever the right to indulge in certain propaganda in an injudicious manner and to the detriment of South Africa. <span class="col_945-946" refersTo="page_0486"/>I should like to call this the grievances politics in which they are indulging nowadays, not only to the downfall of the Government, but also to that of the Whites, and if the Whites in South Africa should go under, there would also be no future for the non-Whites in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Germiston (District) who has just resumed his seat started way back in the dark ages. I really do not understand this trend which has become prevalent in the Nationalist Party over the last two weeks, since the session started. I think they must be in an absolutely blind panic. They are going back to before 1948 to look for something with which to whip the Opposition. They have to go back to before that date in order to find something. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Carltonville with that interjection is just as guilty as the hon. member for Germiston District, who spoke about white bread made of soya beans. He said that the bread we had then was not even real bread. Let me tell that hon. member that that was the best bread he ever had in his life. It was bread that did him more good than anything he has eaten before or since. Surely he knows that that bread was introduced for a purpose. [Interjections.] It is no good the hon. member for Stilfontein shouting about it. He existed on that bread and he was very grateful for it in those days. I want to say that I, too, was grateful for that bread. I am not one of those people living in a ministerial house with a R600 barbeque outside. Let me say that I was not born under those circumstances. I have stood in the same queues that hon. member spoke about. I want to say that I was proud to stand in them, because it was part of the offering we were making towards the war effort. My mother did not object, as his mother and his wife did because they had to stand in a queue. This is something that those hon. members cannot understand. They have never fought a war. They do not know what it is. The only war they have ever fought was against their own country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to state categorically that the hon. member for South Coast has never said that we will not have Bantu as gangers on the Railways. That is on record once and for all. He has never said this and it is not the policy of the United Party not to use them. It is the policy of the United Party to use non-Whites in every category to the best of their ability and to let them develop to the maximum of their potential.</p>

<p>Yesterday the hon. member for Carletonville complained bitterly about the corps of unproductive White workers which has developed. He said that the reason for our labour shortage in this country is that too many White people were being employed in unproductive capacities. Has he asked himself why they are being employed in an unproductive capacity&#x003F; They are being kept down there because there is nobody else to do that work. If they would open the door and allow the non-Whites to do that work, the Whites could also develop to the maximum of their potential. I maintain that the White workers are today being held back in their development in South Africa because of the illogical policies of this Government, which have placed a ceiling on their development because they are holding the non-Whites back who should be moving in behind the Whites as they progress up the labour scale of development.</p>

<p>It is my intention this afternoon to discuss with the hon. the Minister of Community Development the question of housing. Unfortunately I see that he has left the Chamber, but I believe he will be back within a few minutes. I preface my remarks by referring to questions I asked him in the last few weeks, which indicate that the hon. the Minister has purchased certain flats. I know, in particular, of a block he has purchased in Pietermaritzburg. I believe he has purchased others throughout the Republic and that it is his intention to purchase still more throughout the Republic in order to house Government officials. I accept that it is the responsibility of his department to provide housing for certain Government officials. What I do not accept is the way in which he is going about it. It is difficult to deal with this without the Minister being here, Sir.</p>

<p>The questions I have asked have elicited the fact that they definitely have purchased flats. The Minister admits this. He admits that the tenants, if they have not already been given notice, will be given notice to leave. In reply to a question this afternoon. the hon. the Minister told me that with regard to the flats in Pietermaritzburg at least, he does not intend offering those tenants alternative accommodation at the moment. If I understand him correctly <span class="col_949-950" refersTo="page_0488"/>from the answers given to the supplementary questions I put to him, if those tenants have not found suitable alternative accommodation on 30th June which is the last date he has allowed them, he will then do his best to assist them. I hope this is a fair summary of the situation as it is today.</p>

He goes on to give the reasons for this which are:</p>

<block name="quote">No consideration is being given to granting the same protection to lessees who are affected as to lessees of property in the private sector, because in terms of the Housing Act, 1966, no profit motive is permitted.</block>

<p>This goes a little bit further. I asked the hon. the Minister whether he was going to find suitable similar alternative accommodation&#x003F; The answer is no. The hon. the Minister is not going to, because he is protected by the Rents Act, or because his Department is not subject to the Rents Act. But what was the position with a firm in Johannesburg who had a block of flats that they wished to demolish for other development&#x003F; His Department and the Department of Planning compelled the landlords to find suitable similar alternative accommodation. In cases where suitable alternative accommodation could not be found at the same rental, that company has been forced to subsidize the rent for those people so long as they used those premises. Why does it not apply to him and his Department&#x003F;</p>

Pietermaritzburg is the fastest growing city in the Republic. There is no doubt about that. This is accepted, but at the same time we are falling down on the provision of housing. When this hon.

The reason why they were stopped was because a non-White had a hammer or a trowel in his hand with which he tapped a block in its place. For that reason the development was stopped. This is the illogicality. Then at the same time that his colleagues stopped the building, this hon. Minister came and took the accommodation away from others.

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that, Mr. Speaker. Then, instead of putting some questions to the hon. the Minister I will make an allegation against him. I must tell him and I must tell the flat dwellers of South Africa that not one of them is safe from the machinations of this Minister. This is so because of this about-face which seems to have taken place in his Department where, instead of providing new accommodation for people, this Minister is merely taking existing accommodation, robbing Peter to put Paul under a roof. They are not worrying about what is happening to Peter, except that he gives the assurance that nobody will sleep in the streets. Of course nobody will sleep in the streets, because the city will not allow them to. But is this Minister now going to wave a magic wand to provide accommodation for these people&#x003F; What sort of accommodation is he going to offer them&#x003F; The point is that it must be suitable and similar accommodation. It must also be as advantageous and as useful to the occupier as the accommodation which he is occupying now. I am afraid this is a point which I cannot accept. I want to quote to the hon. the Minister a letter which I have received and it reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">It is dead easy for the Government, all of whom earn thousands of rand per annum and have every possible comfort, to make these absurd laws knowing as we all do that there is no accommodation in the city at the moment. The majority of people in flats are elderly pensioners who have a struggle to exist on present-day pensions, so what happens to those and also families from Highlands Flats&#x003F; To turn one lot of people out of their homes in order to house other people makes one wonder whether the Government has forgotten that they are dealing with human beings and not a flock of sheep sent out to graze during a bad and prolonged drought.</block>

<p>The writer of the letter then goes on to suggest a solution:</p>

<block name="quote">The only solution is for people in flats to combine and refuse point-blank to move unless and until the Government finds them decent alternative accommodation within their means, or, if this is not possible, to house them in a good hotel, pay for storage of all furniture and go on paying until they do find accommodation.</block>

<p>I do not know if the hon. the Minister is prepared to do that but I sincerely hope that he is. I sincerely hope that the people who are going to be displaced from this block of flats, and other flats which I believe this hon. Minister is going to purchase, will not suffer and will not sleep in the streets.</p>

<p><span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_0491"/>For the sake of the record I want to put something straight. Before the hon. the Minister replies, or one of the members on the other side asks us what about the block of flats that was expropriated by the Natal Provincial Administration in Clarence Road. Durban, I would like to clarify the matter. The story has been going around that the Provincial Administration of Natal has done exactly what this hon. Minister has done in Pietermaritzburg, namely that it has expropriated a block of flats, that it is throwing the tenants out and that it is going to house in that block of flats certain teachers employed by the Department of Education. The position is that that block of flats is in an area which was zoned some years ago for educational development. It has been expropriated for an extension to the Clarence Road Primary School in Durban. This block of flats is to be demolished to allow for extensions to that school. There is no parallel whatsoever between that case and the case which I have drawn to the attention of this House in Pietermaritzburg.</p>

On the 9th February, 1971, they were given four months&#x2019; notice to move, but on the 15th February that notice was withdrawn. They were advised that owing to difficulties with building and earth moving the demolishment of the block will not take place now, but at some future date.

<heading>DEPOPULATION OF THE RURAL AREAS</heading>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That this House notes with concern the extremely undesirable position which prevails in large rural areas today as a result of population movements, and strongly urges the Government to consider the advisability of, <i>inter alia,</i> curbing the depopulation of rural areas, caused by the movement of Whites, by&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) placing the agricultural industry on a sound footing;</li>

<li>(b) stimulating the development of commerce and industry in these areas; and</li>

<li>(c) taking the necessary steps to increase confidence in these areas.</li>

</ol>

<p>I should like to begin my speech by quoting from what was said a week or two ago in <i>Die Burger</i> about the census and the depopulation of the rural areas. The report read as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great population explosion among the Coloureds and the alarming White depopulation of the rural areas, are two of the most important features of last year&#x2019;s census, which was published yesterday by the Minister of Statistics, Mr. Loots.</block>

<p>Following that, Sir, the correspondent mentioned quite a number of places, particularly in the Cape, and showed how tremendously the number of White persons in those districts and towns had decreased. But the report went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tendency for Whites in the rural areas to stream to the urban areas in increasing numbers is also discernible in other Provinces. The only exceptions are rural towns where new growth points have been established. <span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_0492"/>The last sentence in particular is of great importance to me. I have quoted from this article in <i>Die Burger</i> because I think it is simply a confirmation of the opinion of informed persons who have been watching the position in South Africa over the years. I am afraid that I have to say this afternoon that the situation in many parts of the rural areas, particularly those of the Cape, and certain parts of the Free State, has developed into a complete tragedy. This was pointed out to us years ago, and today there are striking examples of this: Newly built schools standing virtually empty; where a town first had a high school it was later converted into a secondary school and today they even find it difficult to maintain a primary school. Everywhere we have monuments of beautiful school hostels built during the past few years which are standing empty and almost abandoned as a result of this situation which has arisen. Every member of this House who is acquainted with the rural areas knows of scores of houses in every town which are standing empty and can be bought for a song. Most of our rural towns in the Cape have become homes for widows and the aged, those who are still prepared to remain anchored to the town in which they were born and still have sentimental ties with that town. Everywhere there are the monuments of businesses, shops and garages eking out a struggling existence, and looking forward with longing to the day when the situation in the rural areas is reversed.</block>

<p>This situation is so easily dismissed by saying that it is a world trend and that we can do nothing about it in any case. Quite recently I read an article which illustrated very well what happened in Texas, for example, where, as a result of tremendous droughts, more and more people had to leave the area. I readily concede that natural conditions also have a lot to do with this problem which has developed so rapidly, particularly in the past decade. But this trend of the migration of Whites in particular from the rural areas is not the only example of world trends which apply locally as well. This same problem exists in other parts of the world. In America, for example, they are trying with their price support policy to do something to counteract the situation. Where there once were prosperous farmers, there are today scores of them who are staring ruin in the face. The businessman in the rural areas has become pessimistic and is becoming more and more afraid of his economic future. This is a strange phenomenon we have here. We speak so easily in terms of development in the Bantu areas, where there is almost no infra-structure of any significance. But in the White rural areas where there is in fact an infrastructure we are allowing the situation to stagnate and people to suffer dire hardships. In remote rural areas farms are lying abandoned; the farmers were forced to look for a subsistence elsewhere. Sheep farms are coming on to the market and are being sold at ridiculously low prices in comparison with a few years ago, while once capitally strong farmers are losing thousands of rand. Nobody in this House is going to tell me that this is a healthy state of affairs. Even if we cannot in this debate today decide on steps to remedy this state of affairs, we will still be achieving one thing&#x2014;to focus the attention of South Africa on this problem which is becoming worse by the day. It is not only a source of concern for the country-dweller, but also for the urban-dweller. Our first task will consequently be to place our agricultural industry on a firm foundation. I have scores of quotations here from which I can read to indicate how the situation has changed over the past few years. I can mention examples of once prosperous farmers from Prince Albert who today have to work on the national roads and who must be prepared&#x2014;this information I received not from English-language newspapers, but from National Party newspapers&#x2014;to work with non-Whites in order to keep themselves and their families going. This is a state of affairs which has developed because many farmers see no future for themselves any more. They have been impoverished by droughts and by lower prices and higher production costs.</p>

<p>It is my task to tell the hon. the Minister this afternoon that we expect certain steps on his part. I am not being critical of what has already been done. On the contrary. I want to express my appreciation that in times of emergency assistance was in fact rendered by the State. For example I associate myself with the stock withdrawal scheme in order to help farmers to rehabilitate their veld. However, I cannot omit to tell the hon. the Minister that the situation is not yet a sound one and that what is being done is not enough. We are not going to overcome this problem, owing to various factors. It has become the policy of this Government to curbspending, <span class="col_959-960" refersTo="page_0493"/>it is as a result of that policy that the banks are today able to give less and less credit to the farmers.</p>

They are saying that the reason why this has to be done is because it is Government policy. I maintain that an incorrect principle is being applied here and that we are curbing production and, what is more, we are further aggravating the position of people who have gone through a terribly difficult time. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that the lack of liquidity of most farmers in the widespread rural areas of the Cape has reached an extent which in my opinion has become quite tragic.</p>

<p>That hon. member represents an urban constituency. It is easy for him to talk because he does not travel around and he does not know what is going on in the country: it is beyond his ken. But we in this House are concerned about the situation, and I want to make it very clear to the hon. the Minister that we must tell the commercial banks to act carefully. The hon. the Minister of Finance said in the past that he did not want production to be curbed, and that the farmer would receive special consideration and recognition and that certain concessions would be made to them. I want to warn the hon. the Minister that that concession which the hon. the Minister of Finance spoke of a year or two ago does not mean very much any more and that if this line of action continues to be taken, people are going to be driven from their land, people who should not be driven from the land. It is no longer going to be only the incompetent farmer who is going to be driven from the rural areas, but some of our best young farmers in South Africa, if this situation continues. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that he must give very serious thought to a suggestion which was made by a President of the S.A. Agricultural Union when he stated some time ago that it seemed to him that a large part of the debts of these people would have to be taken over. The President of the S.A.Wool Growers&#x2019; Association said that the Land Bank would have to expand its powers even further, and that it would have to be prepared to take over the agricultural financing of many of these people. I know that this specific point is not at issue in this debate, but I think that it is one of the methods which can be applied to restore stability to so many of our people in the rural areas. I want the hon. the Minister to give attention to those two things, viz. taking over the long-term debts of the farmers, and the question the liquidity of the farmers in the rural areas. On a previous occasion the hon. the Minister admitted that the high rates of interest the farmers had to pay were giving him sleepless nights, but the hon. gentleman did, also through the Minister of Finance, introduce an interesting subsidy scheme for us which had been advocated I do not know how many times by this side of the House but which only came into operation last year. But in the five to six years prior to that the financial position of many farmers became steadily worse. Although we are grateful that the scheme has been introduced, I must say that it is a pity there was such a long delay before it came into operation. Sir, I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister for his consideration that we must not think only in terms of the man who is able to obtain a subsidy in respect of long-term loans which he has with recognized financial institutions, but that we must also think in terms of the man who obtained his loan at a private institution or from a private person and who does not fall into the category laid down by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I think that this is one of the immediate steps which can be taken to give these people a little more confidence in future. I am glad the hon. the Prime Minister is here because the hon. gentleman gave us the assurance that if we found, when it comes to the wool farmer, that the schemes on which the various wool producing countries have agreed, are not successful, the Government will not be unwilling to help the wool farmer in South Africa further. I think that will be welcomed. I want to point out to the hon. the Prime Minister that the wool industry today is back where it was in 1930; one cannot argue that away. The wool industry is one of the most important types of farming for earning foreign currency for South Africa. In addition there are more or less 35,000 people who are specifically involved in the wool <span class="col_961-962" refersTo="page_0494"/>industry or who are also producing wool through mixed farming. This is a considerable number of people, and that is why it is a good thing the hon. the Prime Minister availed himself of the opportunity to give those people some confidence. But I must also warn that if we have measures with which we want to help the wool farmers, we must be prepared to say so, and we must not have a situation similar to the one where assistance was merely promised to the farmers in the Sunday River valley. The hon. the Prime Minister paid a visit to them, and now they are asking the hon. the Prime Minister to pay a return visit in order to see how the situation has deteriorated after a year. In other words, the assistance which was offered, was quite inadequate. We must ask ourselves the question whether the assistance of the State today is adequate, and if it is not adequate we must have the courage of our convictions to find the money for that industry. [Interjection.] Of course we will support the hon. gentleman. We have said so before. You see, Sir, we have inflation in many spheres, but in many parts of the rural areas we have already had a recession for the past five or six years, and surely it cannot be a good thing for a country, where one wants the people to produce, to have a condition of recession develop. If the hon. members opposite want to adopt stronger measures in this respect, they can count on the support of this side of the House, because we have previously made our position in regard to this matter quite clear. If it is necessary to help an industry or a sector of agriculture which finds itself in difficulties, we on this side are prepared to do so. That is why the first step will be to place our agricultural industry on a firm foundation. I do not want to discuss long-term policy in agriculture with the hon. the Minister now, because we will have a further opportunity to do so this year. But what I want to emphasize now, is that over and above the steps which have been taken, we will also get on the part of the Government the attitude that if the situation deteriorates further it will be prepared to help.</p>

<p>I now come to the second point of my motion, and that is the stimulation of trade and industry in these areas. Now I know that this is a tremendously difficult question. How does one stimulate industry, and how does one stimulate trade, if there are insufficient opportunities to do so&#x003F; But this is not unique to South Africa. This Government is stimulating industry in the border areas, along the borders of the Black reserves. If that is possible in terms of their policy, I think it is also possible to stimulate industry artificially in the rural areas as well. Here I want to remind the hon. member of the point made in the statement in <i>Die Burger</i> which I quoted at the outset, i.e. that the only exception is rural towns where new growth points have developed. Sir, nobody can tell me that there are no opportunities to establish new growth points. I can mention many examples of rural towns. There are places such as Vryburg, which also have one or two as Middelburg, which already have one or two minor industries. There are places such minor industries already. There are places in the South-Western Districts which have become impoverished as a result of the drought and poor economic conditions in agriculture. There, too, one finds are minor industries today. Why is it then impossible to single out certain points in our greater rural areas where we can establish such industries&#x003F;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>If this has already been done, how is it possible then that the White populations of De Aar, of Beaufort West, of Graaff-Reinet and of Cradock are all decreasing&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister says that this has already been done, I want to encourage him to do so on a larger scale, because then he will help check the depopulation of the rural areas and he will ensure the survival of these rural areas. I want to point out to the hon. Minister that a start can be made with certain of the minor industries associated with our agricultural industry. However, there must then be a willingness on our part. There must be enthusiasm on our part to tackle such a task. Then we must have the vision to want to tackle it. But what are we doing&#x003F; We are saying: &#x201C;It is a world trend. Therefore we must be satisfied with what is happening in South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I want to mention to the hon. the Minister a further example of what is happening. It is true that Whites are leaving the rural areas, but as a result of the poor conditions of agriculture, the non-White population is also moving to the towns. How long will those people remain there if they are not assured of a subsistence there&#x003F; Consequently, for the sake of those people as well, who are today creating a major <span class="col_963-964" refersTo="page_0495"/>social problem for us because of their poverty, it is imperative that there should be such industries to supply those people with work. Scores of farmers today are getting rid of their labourers. It is not because they do not want to help these people. They simply cannot afford to keep those labourers on their farms. Those people are today moving to the towns. If they cannot find a means of subsistence, what must become of them&#x003F; That is why it is essential that we should also think in terms of the development of minor industries in the larger rural towns. Hon. members may perhaps say that we do not have enough water in the remoter parts of the Cape rural areas. That is quite correct, but I have been informed by an expert that if we are prepared to drill deep enough, we will find more than enough artesian water to maintain the largest of industries in the rural areas.</p>

Is it impossible to do this&#x003F; It is not impossible, but as I said, we must have the will, the vision and the willingness to tackle it.</p>

<p>I come now to the last point of my motion, viz. that we must take the necessary steps to increase confidence in these areas. My original view was that we should ask the hon. the Minister of Planning to undertake more surveys and investigations into the rural areas. A year or two ago there was in fact a commission which instituted an investigation in regard to the greater Western Cape. They brought out a good report, but I wonder whether that commission went far enough. I wonder whether it is not again time the hon. the Minister thought in terms of a commission which could tell him precisely what may be done in the rural areas of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am glad to hear that. If his Department does have all the knowledge and information, then he must tell us today in which direction we are moving and in which direction we are able to go. We are not merely interested in the precious and semi-precious metals lying buried there. Wonderful investigations have already been made in that regard. We know that a search for oil is being made. We hope that those raw materials will be found, because that will restore confidence in the rural areas. But that is not all we are aiming at. We are also aiming at achieving the decentralization of industries in the rural areas, so that when we refer to the decentralization of industries we are referring to something tangible. That the hon. the Minister can give us, if he has the answers.</p>

<p>My concern in regard to this matter is not only from an economic point of view. The economic point of view is very important because we can ensure that the economy of the South African rural areas is not further handicapped. But what is of even greater importance, is that we think in terms of the manpower and human resources which we ought to have in the rural areas. We cannot have South African rural areas which consist of old people and pensioners and where young people are no longer available, or where they do not want to stay. We ought to adopt a course of leading our young people back to the rural areas, where they can make a decent living. That is what the long-term direction of this Government ought to be. I urge the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and the hon. the Minister of Planning to give us direction now and to show us the future course to follow, so that we can restore confidence in our rural areas. If that does not happen now, by waiting a year or two, it may become altogether too late.</p>

<p>For those who listened to the hon. member for Newton Park this afternoon it is very clear that he left Hanover years ago and is now sitting in Newton Park. This is an old story, but many old stories remain true. The same applies to Walmer.</p>

<p>A motion has been moved here to the effect that the House notes with concern the &#x201C;extremely undesirable position&#x201D;, etc. In regard to this it is asked time and again how desirable this process of the depopulation of the rural areas is, while the approach ought to be: How natural is the process, and how can we adjust to it&#x003F; Let me say at once that we have the greatest <span class="col_965-966" refersTo="page_0496"/>sympathy with the problems of most of the Cape farmers where they, as a result of the drought, have been forced to their knees. This Government has helped those people. Hon. members need only ask those farmers. They are still farming and have been brought to their knees, although everyone will say that a government has never helped farmers as this Government has done. I leave it at that, Mr. Speaker. Hon. members who will speak after me, will concentrate more on agriculture.</p>

<p>What I want to discuss is the depopulation of the rural areas. This motion also refers to the depopulation of the rural areas. It does not refer to the depopulation of the Cape. I now want to make it very clear to that hon. member that he must not make such a general statement. There is depopulation of the rural areas in the Cape and in the Southern Free State. But there is no depopulation of the rural areas in the areas north of Bloemfontein. There is no depopulation of the rural areas in Natal. There is no depopulation of the rural areas south of the Eastern Cape. There is no depopulation of rural areas in the Transvaal. The hon. member does not know what he is talking about. He has been away from the rural areas for too long.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not take into account at all when this depopulation of the rural areas began. Now I may just inform him that the first signs of the depopulation of the rural areas, of the movement of the White population from the rural areas to the urban complexes began in the early &#x2019;thirties after the predecessor of this National Party Government had at the end of the &#x2019;twenties proceeded to introduce industrialization into this country as well with the establishment of Iscor. It is an absolutely normal process in any developing country that such a shift should take place, that people should move from the rural areas to the urban complexes.</p>

<p>No, that hon. member cannot even go and speak in Sea Point any more, but now he is speaking here where protection is afforded him. The development of South Africa has been the cause of the movement from the rural to the urban areas. Nor did this take place at the expense of agriculture. I want to repeat that this Government is sympathetically disposed towards the farmers, and that it is concerned about them. That is why our leader, the hon. the Prime Minister, said that he would not leave the wool farmers in the lurch. The development process, however, is a development symptom. That is what is happening. I know that when one finds oneself in a small town it is not a pleasant sight to see that that town has become depopulated. But one must also take into account to some extent at least the process of town development and the reasons why towns have been established at specific places. In the previous century, when most of the smaller towns in South Africa were established, they were established at a place where the necessary Government services and school and church facilities could be made available. The towns were laid out in such a way that one could travel from the one to the other in a day&#x2019;s time with the means of transport available at that time. A person took his horse and carriage, loaded up his wife and children, rode to church in the morning and returned again at night. That is why we find that the smallest towns are separated by a distance of 25 to 30 miles. But with our modern means of transport, with our better communication system, including telecommunication and road links, there is greater mobility among the population. Now it is much easier to drive from one town to another or to the nearest regional town or city to make purchases. Hence a distinction between everyday requisites, requisites needed on a medium term basis, and requisites needed on a long-term basis, has been made as far as the consumer or the public is concerned. In this way the public purchase groceries at a place nearby because they need them frequently. Furniture they will buy somewhere else, perhaps because they need it less, because they want a wider choice, and because it is easier to get there as a result of modern transport. Hence the system of a development of smaller towns and the movement of the public from the smaller towns to the regional towns. This is an absolutely normal process we are dealing with.</p>

<p>This process has not taken place at the expense of agriculture. The agricultural production of South Africa is many times greater than it was 30 years ago. Nor is the quality of the products any poorer than it was in those years. On the contrary, it is far better, because this is a natural process which is in progress.</p>

<p><span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0497"/>The only step taken by this Government which earned the praise of the hon. member for Newton Park is the stock withdrawal scheme which was introduced to help farmers. These stock withdrawal schemes must inevitably result in some farmers leaving their farms. It cannot be otherwise. The legislation which the hon. member approved in principle last year, but the details of which he opposed, namely the Subdivision of Agricultural Land Act, which prevents agricultural land from being subdivided into smaller units, is surely of a consolidatory nature. Surely it is as clear as can be that if two farms are consolidated, one farmer must leave. Where must he go to&#x003F;</p>

<p>To the towns. Let us now understand something else clearly. One of the best investments which exists for agriculture is a proper, ordered and well-developed urban complex, because that is where one finds the market for those agricultural products. Let us get one thing straight, once and for all. It is not possible and it will never be possible to keep a specific farmer on a specific farm. This Government has, however, given thought to the rural areas and to rural developments. In spite of the boasting of all the Opposition members to the effect that it is really they to whom the credit is due for this development, I just want to tell them that it is this Government which established the Orange River Scheme, that it is this Government which built the Hendrik Verwoerd dam, and that it is this Government which built a tunnel which is among the longest in the world, and with one purpose&#x2014;which is&#x003F; The specific purpose was to bring back what was probably in the vicinity of 5,000 farmers to the rural areas. Those 5,000 farmers could not all return to De Aar and Beaufort West. I do not want to single out De Aar and Beaufort West as black sheep, but the people cannot make a living there. That is not all. Recently this Government announced a great new development, namely the development of a railway line from Sishen in the Northern Cape to Saldanha on the West Coast. That means that the railway lines will traverse a tremendously large area of the Cape.</p>

<p>Just as the National Party has up to now built everything it said it was going to build. That is development which is going to be brought to a specific area because the opportunity is there. But to utter the kind of nonsense that hon. member uttered here, viz. that the Government should merely establish industries in the interests of agriculture and bring these to the various smaller towns, is nonsensical. How can it&#x003F; Surely an investigation has to be made. That is why a policy of decentralization of this Government is a very clear one. It is the policy of the State to decentralize for economic reasons. I also want to say that if that decentralization for economic reasons can also succeed in supplying a large number of Bantu with work within their homelands, then one has the ideal situation. In other words, this idea of decentralization has a dual purpose. In the first instance, consideration must be given to the recognized benefits which are contained in decentralization of activities based on purely economic, strategic and social grounds for any country. In the second instance, it must also be based on the implementation of the accepted national policy of separate development. In this respect the National Party and this Government will play its part in a realistic manner, after they have investigated the situation properly and know what is going on.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Fauresmith who has just spoken, is a medical practitioner, but nevertheless represents a rural constituency in the southern Free State, an area where things are not going too well with the farmers either. When he rose to his feet, I thought that he would support this motion. That is the least I expected from him as a representative of that area. I do not know whether he supports the motion of the hon. member for Newton Park, but he condemned the motion of the hon. member for Newton Park from beginning to end, and spoke of the good work of the Government and the assistance which it has up to now rendered. But when did any one of us say that we were not grateful to the Government for what it has done in regard to farming, and particularly in recent times with the stock withdrawal scheme&#x003F; However, <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_0498"/>the hon. member for Fauresmith stated that an inevitable result of the withdrawal scheme would be that many farmers would leave their farms. It will only be the farmers whose number of stock fall within the higher subsidy scheme, who would leave their farms. In other words, the farmers who are farming with 1,000 to 1,200 head of stock. [Interjections.] The big farmer cannot do this, because he cannot take R1 per sheep for the balance of his stock.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether this was not a desirable and a natural depopulation of the rural areas. The depopulation of the rural areas, to a minor extent, is perhaps a natural phenomenon, because it is happening in other countries and not only in South Africa. However, the rate of depopulation of the rural areas during the last two to three years has been abnormal. The situation is abnormal because any farmer sitting here, regardless of what province he comes from, will admit that the number of farms in his immediate vicinity which are in the market and for which there are no buyers is legion. I know of wards where 10 years ago there were 24 farmers and where there are at present only four. This is not natural depopulation; it is unnatural depopulation. How could it be anything else&#x003F; The farmer also sends his sons to university today. Does the hon. member really expect, that with the future offered by agriculture and, in particular, the wool industry, that the young man who has graduated at university will, even on the insistence of his father, return to the farm&#x003F; Why should he do so&#x003F; Are we in favour of large consortiums buying up all the land and establishing large units in order to promote agriculture&#x003F;</p>

<p>Hon. members can ask the Deputy Minister. He knows about it. He knows for example what went on in the Bethal district. The fact remains that if the farming community as such, the average farmer and even the small farmer who see their way clear to making a living, are not given a firm foundation, the area passes into the hands of big, capitally strong undertakings which purchase the land not so much in order to carry on farming activities, but to enrich themselves through, for example, keeping slaughter stock on that land. When the land passes into the hands of those people, farming becomes unsound. Hon. members know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith said that this depopulation was not such a serious matter. I wonder whether the hon. member knows what the figures for the Free State over the last 10 years are. He speaks so easily of depopulation having taken place only in the southern Free State. According to the statistics the Free State White population has increased over the last 10 years by 25,000 and the non-White population by 280,000.</p>

<p>It proves that that increase took place in and around Bloemfontein, Kroonstad and the gold mining areas and that the population in the rural areas decreased accordingly. If the hon. member for Stellenbosch cannot realize that, then I do not know. If the total White population of the Free State has increased by 25,000 over the past 10 years, and one compares the expansion which has taken place in the urban areas, then surely it is obvious that there has been depopulation in the rural areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch can jump up and make his own speech later. If he would interrupt me less frequently, I will be able to complete mine. When we speak of the depopulation of the rural areas we think of a multitude of towns in the Karoo. Then we are not only thinking of towns such as those to which the hon. member for Fauresmith referred, when he said &#x201C;Well then, it was a day&#x2019;s journey by horse and carriage, and that is why they established a town there&#x201D;. We think of towns which are situated along the main railway line and the national roads. I am <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0499"/>thinking for example of a town like Cradock.

<p>When we reach the situation where the White population of a rural town of the standard of Cradock has decreased over the past 10 years, there is something drastically wrong with agriculture. I did not think there was one representative of agriculture in this debate who would be able to say anything against this resolution, which requests the Government to apply certain methods. When we discuss the methods which are being applied we think back to the many debates we have already had here on rates of interest which are too high for the farmers to bear. In any case, they cannot go on any more. We think of how we have discussed the possibility of alleviating to a certain extent the burden of debt of the farmers by using the red pencil when they cannot fend for themselves. I do not at this stage want to say that all these recommendations must be carried out. But I do want to say that if some of them are not carried out, there is no rosy future for agriculture, whether it be agronomy, stock-breeding, or anything else. Then we cannot expect the young men to return to the rural areas, because they will not want to do so. Nor do I take it amiss of them for not wanting to. I do not take it amiss of a young man who has a degree today for saying that he is not going to go farming. I cannot take it amiss of him, because I cannot give him or my own sons or my neighbour&#x2019;s sons the assurance that there is any future for them in agriculture: that they have any chance of liquidating their capital debts which they have incurred over a period of 25 or 30 years, and that they will be able to become independent farmers.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to confine myself in the time at my disposal to the sheep and wool farming industry as such, and here I want to refer to the southern Free State and the whole of the Cape. I do not want to refer only to that area to which the hon. member for Fauresmith was referring when he said that no people in the Eastern Cape had withdrawn from agriculture. He knows nothing about the Eastern Cape; it is too far away from him. I am speaking about the southern Free State and the whole of the Cape, with the exception of the western area where people farm with wheat and fruit. Sir, something must be done to save the situation in those parts of the country which have now for the past seven, eight, nine and 10 years been experiencing protracted droughts to which there seems to be no end. Rains have in fact fallen now in some of those areas, but now the people are faced with the problem of locusts, caterpillars, etc. I simply do not know how the situation is to be rehabilitated.</p>

<p>I should like to second what the hon. member for Newton Park said, <i>viz.</i> that we make applications to the hon. the Minister of Planning for the establishment of far more growth points. Sir, a few days ago I received a reply from the Minister to representations I had made to him to the effect that a certain place should be declared to be a growth point, and I want at this stage to say thank you very much to the Minister for the prompt attention he always gives to correspondence I address to him. The hon. the Minister, quite rightly, said that there were so many places in regard to which application was being made to the effect that they be declared growth points, that it is an impossible task to comply with all the requests. I accept that. I accept that almost every place today is making application to be regarded as a growth point. But the hon. the Minister also said&#x2014;and I am glad to hear this &#x2014;that a special committee has been appointed which is now dealing with all these applications and which is investigating which places may be regarded as growth points. Obviously we cannot declare every town <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_0500"/>or every area to be a growth point, but I want to suggest that the growth points be centralized in such a way that they can also help neighbouring towns and areas; in other words that there should be one growth point in every area where there can be larger schools to which parents can send their children instead of to the coastal cities or other large places in the interior. Industries can then be centralized there. These need not necessarily be industries connected with agriculture. I cannot understand that argument at all. It can be any kind of industry, which can with good result be centralized. I cannot see why one man should not manufacture windows in De Aar while another manufactures screws in Beaufort West. Surely it is obvious that it is as easy to do so as in East London or Port Elizabeth for example. They still have to obtain their steel and their wire from Iscor, and in addition these have to be conveyed over longer distances. Sir, that is the reason why we have in the first instance addressed our representations to the hon. the Minister of Planning, whose committee has to deal with this matter. Our plea is that growth points should be determined with the utmost speed, so that people can know where they must go, and so that a stop can be put to the depopulation of the rural areas. One can then go to those growth points and not necessarily to the cities.</p>

<p>I then come to what the hon. the Prime Minister said in regard to wool in the no-confidence debate, and also to what the hon. the Minister of Agriculture said when he addressed a meeting of the National Woolgrowers Association, namely that the Government will be partner of the wool industry in regard to the problems facing the wool industry. We should very much like to know how far the plans have progressed, over and above the plans which already exist. The aspect to which the hon. the Prime Minister referred in regard to the planning of the southern hemisphere countries has to do more with the marketing of the commodity. When we talk about the marketing of the commodity, then we have had the experience of what happened very recently where there are already three countries which are co-operating in regard to marketing protection. We know what effect this has had up to this stage. We also know that there are many deficiencies in the present schemes for the marketing of wool. But above all, we know that even if we should succeed in eliminating the marketing problems which exist today, we will still not have succeeded in bringing the price of the product to a level where it is profitable for the wool farmer. Other methods will have to be utilized. When the hon. the Minister of Agriculture said before the congress of the National Woolgrowers that the Government would be a partner of the wool farmers as far as its problems are concerned, I take it that he meant that if the funds which the woolgrowers have at their disposal&#x2014;the R35 million, or whatever it is&#x2014;have been depleted as a result of the payment of a price to the farmers above the existing market price, the Government will then step in and help. I see problems in this regard. If the market should be as it is at present next season and if the assistance is to be of the kind the wool industry has given itself by means of its own levies up to this stage, then it will be a tremendous amount for which the Government will have to stand surety for. But the fact remains that if price protection is not given in the first instance, and if in the second instance plans are not made by means of which stability can be brought to the wool industry, and in the third instance if it is not possible, in terms of the third leg of this motion, to create confidence in the future of the agricultural industry, particularly the sheep and wool industry, then I do not know where we are going. Every day we hear farmers saying: &#x201C;Ach, I wonder whether it is still worthwhile farming with merino sheep&#x003F; I think I will go in for cross-bred lambs instead&#x201D;. Sir, we must not forget that the wool industry, which has for many years earned R100 million and more in foreign currency for our country, apart from the 13 per cent or 14 per cent of the production processed in the country, is a valuable industry. It is almost a centuries old industry. The wool industry was the pride of South Africa. If we cannot retain the pride of the people, then we must see to it that they are able to retain their self-respect; we must make it possible for them to retain their self-respect. I want to make a special plea here to the effect that hon. members should all support this motion, instead of being divided in regard to a motion of this nature, which asks nothing more or nothing less than that the Government should make a special attempt to place agriculture on a firm foundation.</p>

<p>Forgive me, Sir; I meant the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs. Sir, I shall not discourage him from going into agriculture, for the simple reason that he has a love for the soil and does not look only at the economic aspect of matters. Because of his inborn love for the soil, he will use his managerial ability to see to it that he will make a success of the undertaking. We must stop talking the agricultural industry into its grave, because this is what we are doing. We should cause a spirit of optimism to prevail in the country for a change. I want to associate myself with what was said by the chairman of the Wool Board in the statement he made only two weeks ago, i.e. that we should not become pessimistic because of the setbacks suffered by the wool industry, and condemn everything related to the wool industry, because there was a future in the wool industry and in this part of our country if we approached the matter realistically and properly. This is what the Opposition is overlooking. I just want to point out a few things. The hon. member for East London (City) said consideration should be given to writing off of certain burdens of debt. I wonder whether the hon. member would be prepared to come and say that at Rietbron, because I know of people in Rietbron who, in spite of a ten-year drought, have been struggling hard and have tried everything in their power to reduce their debts in respect of their fodder loans, etc. They told me as well as this Deputy Minister, that the day we considered writing off burdens of debt, we must not forget the man who had conscientiously fulfilled his obligations towards the department in spite of problems and difficulties. We should bear this in mind as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Newton Park spoke about empty schools and hostels. I am glad he mentioned that, because in regard to education as well, this Government and the Cape Provincial Administration in particular, have done everything in their power to ensure the creation of every facility in the rural areas. But what happened then&#x003F; When the Opposition moved a motion of no-confidence in the Provincial Council a few years ago, their most severe point of attack was the question of these empty schools and hostels. But today the hon. member says here with tears in his eyes that schools and hostels are standing empty and that the rural areas are still becoming depopulated in spite of the schools and hostels which have been built. That constituted their major point of attack.</p>

<p>In regard to businesses in the rural areas. I want to agree with him, because I know that things are going badly with some businesses in my constituency. But now I just want to put one question to the hon. member for Newton Park. At the time when he was still farming at Richmond, where did he buy his requirements&#x003F;</p>

<p>In that case I acknowledge that he was right, but I want to tell you today, and I want to address this especially to the rural areas of the Cape Province, that we are so fond of saying that depopulation must be checked, but what are we ourselves doing as farmers to check that depopulation&#x003F; What are we ourselves doing to ensure that the businesses can keep going&#x003F; Why do we have to buy all our requirements in the large cities&#x003F; Why can we not support our smaller towns and buy our requirements in those towns&#x003F; This is a matter which is very close to my heart and I am saying this without being at all afraid of political implications. If our farmers are genuinely interested in our towns, they will use their means in those towns and not spend their money in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to sub-section (a) of this motion dealing with agriculture, and more specifically to the Karoo region and the Southern Free State. We have to ask ourselves why depopulation occurs. The first and probably one of the most important reasons, is a purely economic one. If a man cannot make a reasonable living on a certain unit, he gets out and sells to <span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_0502"/>another man. Surely it is logical that if a man cannot make a reasonable living, he gets out. We have experienced a decade in which land fetched exceptionally good prices. Surely people had the right to sell that land at that stage and to find a better livelihood where they could earn a better living. Surely it is logical that we should have an exodus as a result of that.</p>

<p>The second major reason for the depopulation of the rural areas is droughts. In my lifetime we have had, and ones I know of, four large exoduses, especially from the rural areas of the Cape Province. The first occurred in 1927/28, at the time of that major drought, the second in 1933/34 when we had another drought and a depression as well. Subsequently, there was an exodus in the post-war period when the prices of land rocketed and people sold small units simply because they could obtain a good price for their land; and then there is the present disastrous drought, during which one has had an exodus like never before. In spite of considerable aid to the small stock industry, aid we have never had before in the history of the small stock industry, this depopulation has occurred.</p>

<p>If we have to make an analysis of the problem of depopulation, how are we to combat it&#x003F; I would say there are four basic factors by means of which one can combat depopulation, i.e. by ensuring income stability and a decent livelihood; by ensuring such protection for one of the natural resources, i.e. the soil, that income stability will be assured; by applying measures of aid in times or disastrous droughts in order to provide sufficient protection against complete destruction; and in the fourth place, by ensuring that units are large enough to be administered as economic units for ensuring a decent livelihood.</p>

<p>When we come to point (a) of these measures to combat depopulation by ensuring income stability, the wool farmer unfortunately has to contend today not only with a serious drought in most parts&#x2014;some parts are still experiencing a drought&#x2014;but also with a slump in wool prices and to a certain extent with a slump in mohair prices as well. What is now being done in an attempt to reduce the effect of this severe slump&#x003F; In the first place, there is the Wool Commission&#x2019;s floor price scheme which has been operating for many years, also in the time of the hon. member for East London City. I can assure you that this floor price scheme, has caused millions of rand to be returned to the wool farmer&#x2019;s pocket over the years. In addition we have had the Wool Commission&#x2019;s supplementary price scheme in the most recent season. Up to the end of January, an amount of more than R8 million was paid out by means of this supplementary price scheme. If things remain constant, in other words if the present price on the world market can be maintained, plus the anticipated 20 per cent decrease in production, we will pay out R14.5 million at the end of this season by means of these supplementary prices. It truly is a credit to the wool farmer of South Africa that he had been able to ensure in good times that we would be able to use these amounts in these difficult times for giving him a better price. In passing, I just want to say that the wool farmer of South Africa is privileged in this respect today because at this stage he can obtain 30 per cent more than his Australian fellow farmer because of this supplementary price. At the moment he is receiving 30 per cent more for his wool. No stone is being left unturned to improve marketing matters and a great deal of progress has already been made with investigations in this respect, here as well as in other partnership countries. In passing, I just want to mention the committee of enquiry appointed by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture to investigate marketing. I want to mention the measures in operation in Australia, where they are also trying as a matter of urgency to improve our marketing system which has perhaps become obsolete over the years.</p>

<p>Then there is the possibility of Government aid. In the scheme which I have mentioned, i.e. our supplementary price scheme, we have an assurance, and I should like to satisfy the hon. member for East London City in that respect. At the N.W.G. Congress, we obtained the assurance from the hon. the Minister of Agriculture and it was repeated by the hon. the Prime Minister in his speech in the no-confidence debate. Therefore we have every confidence that it will in fact come when it is necessary. To this I want to add that during the past three years, R4 million was given to the wool industry for research and publicity.</p>

<p>In terms of point (b) it must be ensured that the natural resources&#x2014;i.e. the soil&#x2014; will enjoy such protection that it will be able to support the farmer. For many years, since 1946, astronomic amounts have been spent on soil conservation in our country. With a view to soil conservation, <span class="col_979-980" refersTo="page_0503"/>loans amounting to millions of rand have been made to farmers at a subsidized rate of interest of 5 per cent. Gradually, however, we came to realize that we were not achieving our ultimate objective. In 1969 this Government introduced legislation not only to streamline the Soil Conservation Act, but also to take persons who did not want to apply soil conservation by the scruff of their necks and to give them a shake so that they would be obliged to protect their natural resources. What did the United Party do at that time&#x003F; Surely this was a long-term measure. In 1969 they opposed the Soil Conservation Bill with might and main. This is a measure which was in fact aimed at saving our natural resources, the soil, from certain destruction. They opposed that measure.</p>

<speech by="#hayward">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. S. HAYWARD</person>:</from>

<p>Which clauses did they oppose&#x003F; The very clause which sought to take a man by the scruff of his neck. They did this for the sake of a vote or two. I want to point out that we have a stock withdrawal scheme. I am glad that hon. members on the opposite side have highly praised that scheme. I am pleased that we have reached unanimity in this respect, because I think that it is the largest scheme which has ever been applied in this country as regards soil conservation. I am glad this Government has had the courage of its convictions to utilize these amounts in order to save our soil. I want to appeal to all small-stock farmers to support this scheme, because it is and remains the only scheme for the future. It is and remains the only scheme which will enable our soil to support us again.</p>

<p>Point (c) calls for measures of aid to be applied in times of drought. I do not think there is any need to debate this aspect. When I think of the fodder subsidies and the fodder loans which were paid out, as well as the railway rebates, I want to ask myself today whether we were realistic in granting all these loans and subsidies. I am doing this with the greatest sense of responsibility of which I am capable. I want to ask whether certain farmers in this country, who owe as much as from R30 to R40 for each small-stock unit in respect of fodder loans, will ever be able to repay those loans in their lifetime. I would admit that it would be foolish to withdraw certain measures during a disastrous drought, but I want to ask that we should evince a greater sense of realism in future in regard to granting this type of aid. During a disastrous drought we should not plunge our people further into debt. We should, however, grant loans and subsidies with more circumspection. I am pleased that, as a result of the report of the Marais Commission, the Government has already decided that in future drought relief will be granted only in respect of units where conservation farming is being applied. This was imperative.</p>

<p>In the disaster area in which I live, special measures were taken to keep the farmer on his land. There a farmer can obtain a loan of R30 for himself, R30 in respect of his wife and R10 for every child. If he is no longer creditworthy, he receives an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R35 for himself. R35 in respect of his wife and R10 for each child. In addition to that a farmer can obtain a labourer&#x2019;s subsidy of R4 per labourer per week. Sir, is this too little aid&#x003F; I want to ask the Opposition in all fairness whether this is not sufficient aid to keep a farmer on his land in a time of emergency. I do not even want to talk about agricultural credit where, if a man has problems, he can be helped by the dear Land Bank of the hon. member for Newton Park. I want to tell the hon. member for Newton Park, that if it were not for the Land Bank hundreds of farmers would have left the Karoo and the rural areas already. There is the interest subsidy; there is the consolidation of brokers&#x2019; loans which we have obtained at a cheaper rate of interest; there are production loans which are obtainable from brokers as well as from the Department of Agricultural Credit, and this is an amount of more than R4,000 per year. What are the rates of interest in our country today&#x003F; The highest State or semi-State rate of interest, i.e. that of the Land Bank, is 6 per cent today. This is the most expensive. The rate of interest of Agricultural Credit is 5 per cent. It is a subsidized rate of interest.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. member has moved from De Aar. He does not know the position there very well.</p>

<p>I now come to the final point, i.e. how to combat depopulation. We can combat it if we ensure that a man has a large enough unit to enable him to make a decent livelihood. I just want to read one paragraph from the published interim report of the Marais Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of the seven agro-ecological regions, the Karoo region, which is 33 million morgen in extent, is the most prone to droughts. Data obtained by officers of the Karoo region and submitted to the Commission indicate that the net income of half the farms is under R3,000 per annum, that 35 per cent or about one-third of the farms have an income of less than R2,000 and that 17 per cent an income of less than R1,000 a year.</block>

<p>In all fairness I want to ask today whether a man and his family will be able to make ends meet with R3,000 per annum, if he has to send his sons to university, give his daughters further education and still maintain a decent standard of living. In 1967 the net income of more than half the units in the Karoo region was less than R3,000. A third was less than R2,000 and 17 per cent was less than R1,000. How on earth must those people manage&#x003F; Seeing that this was in 1967, I wonder what the figures are today. I quote more from the report of the Marais Commission-&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because uneconomic farming units constitute a serious obstacle, this aspect warrants urgent attention. The Committee is firmly convinced that if the considerable and repeated expenditures connected with drought relief, together with the direct and indirect stock losses resulting from droughts, are taken into account, the Republic cannot afford to permit the continued existence of unsound farming systems which ignore conservation principles, and that drastic action by the State is fully justified.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, our greatest problem is to be found in the fact that there are units which are too small. Let us face the fact that this is so. Last hear the Government introduced a measure which will ensure that no further subdivision of agricultural land will take place without the Minister&#x2019;s approval. What did the United Party do at the time&#x003F; They opposed the Act with might and main. This is a measure which is directly aimed at preventing the fragmentation of our agricultural land, as contained in this report. And yet the United Party comes along today and asks us to support a motion which will check the depopulation of the rural areas. What nonsense is this&#x003F; Because of the rise in the standard of living it is simply impossible for these people to continue making a living on these small units. We must suggest larger units with all the might we have.</p>

<p>I just want to mention one example. In my constituency there is a study committee which investigated a certain area in which seven farmers are farming on a unit of 8,000 morgen. On that unit eight tractors, seven motor cars, six light trucks, etc., are in use and there are 24 labourers. That study committee established that if one farmer were to remain on that farm and the rest were to seek other employment, that total unit would be able to produce R22,000 more per annum as a result of savings. Perhaps this is the solution for many of the farmers on small units in the Karoo, i.e. that we should not only farm co-operatively and use our labour and machinery co-operatively, but also consolidate certain small units, appoint one man to administer and farm it while the rest find other employment. Let us face the fact for a change. For that reason I said at the beginning that we should evince a sense of realism in discussing depopulation. We must not talk nonsense and say that the Government should keep all the people in the rural areas. That is impossible. Purely economic reasons determine that he should leave. This Government&#x2019;s measures are all in fact designed to help the small man. There are all the many measures of aid and relief.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that the wool industry has always been an industry which has stood on its own feet. At the moment it is experiencing problems and we know that the Government is behind us to support us, but do not make a begging industry of the wool industry, because that is not what we want to be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in reading this motion I gained the impression that this was an opportunity for making positive suggestions to help to place the agricultural industry on a sound basis, because I was <span class="col_983-984" refersTo="page_0505"/>expecting positive suggestions to come from the Opposition. I came to this debate with an open mind this afternoon. The only request made by the hon. member for Newton Park was that debts should be written off. That is what it amounts to. His practical solution was that we should write off the debts of certain farmers who are in financial difficulties. However, in the preceding few hours we had been attacked about tax increases. These two things simply cannot be reconciled. But what bothered me most was the fact that in introducing this motion, which I had thought we would not make a political issue, the hon. member used the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Growth points and development are being created in Bantu areas; why not in the White areas as well&#x003F;</block>

<p>I know that when hon. members on the opposite side manage to assemble a few farmers at a meeting, they say at those meetings that growth points are being created for the Bantu but not for the Karoo areas. That is the sting in this matter. I regarded this motion as one which could be discussed here in a nice way. But that hon. member should tell those farmers whether those Bantu in the Bantu area can get a subsidy of 55 per cent on the erection of any waterwork or pipeline. He must tell them whether the Bantu can get a subsidy of 55 per cent on the erection of a fence, whether they can get a subsidy of 50 per cent on fodder purchases, and whether they can get a loan of 50 per cent, without security, from the Department of Agricultural Credit on the rest of the fodder which they cannot buy cash. People already owing R30 per sheep can get this loan. When the hon. member wants to make a political issue of this matter he should ask whether Bantu can get this. The hon. member must not try to catch us in this ham-handed way. I am very disappointed. I had thought the hon. member would come forward with a positive idea in this debate.</p>

<p>At the same time we must not proceed from the assumption either that the Government is not sympathetically disposed as regards this problem of depopulation. We do not deny that depopulation is taking place. It is taking place, and we have appointed a commission of inquiry in this connection. This commission issued a fine report. The commission found that it is not only South Africa which has this problem to contend with. In the report it is stated that in 1957 a conference of all European countries was held in Scheveningen in the Netherlands. At that conference it was stated that the cities in Europe were becoming so large that they were becoming congested, which caused development problems and created mass-minded people. The report goes on as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The rural areas would lose especially their younger and most able people to the cities, with fatal results to the entire country.</block>

<p>This was the finding of the congress in the Netherlands as far as European depopulation of the rural areas is concerned. In the rural areas one can earn a certain amount, but with the manpower shortage in our country one can easily earn twice as much in the cities with their bright lights, with all their amenities, their tennis courts and swimming baths. Must we now, despite this fact, take such a person by the scruff of the neck and tell him, &#x201C;You may be able to get a good price for your land, but the Government says you may not sell and is compelling you to remain in the rural areas&#x201D;&#x003F; The hon. member for East London City says that there are innumerable farms in all four provinces on the market without there being any buyers for them. Why should one make such a statement&#x003F; I am looking for a piece of land to buy, but I simply cannot find it in the Transvaal. Why must the hon. member generalize&#x003F;</p>

<p>In order to give hon. members an indication of the position in the United States, I just want to read to hon. members what President Nixon said last month, and I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">In his recent conference with governors and civic leaders of five States in North Dakota, the United States President reiterated the need for local people and local units of government to make sound plans for creative rural growth. Without question, the people in agriculture will be in the forefront of these efforts. It is imperative to provide new opportunities&#x2014;economic, social, cultural and recreational&#x2014;to stimulate the wholesome expansion of small cities and towns &#x2014;new growth centres in America&#x2019;s heartland.</block>

<p>This is precisely what the hon. the Minister of Planning is going to explain to the hon. members during the discussion of the Planning Vote. <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_0506"/>The Planning Advisory Council is assisting us in this. It is assisting us in order to see what we can do in this connection. I admit that this is a problem, and no-one is trying to hide it. But one must be realistic too. Where are our large concentrations of population&#x003F; They are in the high-rainfall areas. Now it so happens that we find our coal deposits, our iron ore, our mineral resources and our Bantu homelands in those areas. These are the very areas where labour is obtainable. But our country also has a low-rainfall area, of which the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet gave us such a striking account. The Karoo area was a good one once; it was an area where the people could look you in the face and where they were proud of being wool farmers&#x2014;they still are today&#x2014;but wool prices have dropped to almost as low a level as during the depression years. The conditions prevailing there are practically those of a depression. What are we doing about that&#x003F; The people are in that area and now hon. members come and tell us that we should establish growth points in that area. The hon. member now wants us to establish a factory there which will manufacture screws and nails. It is easy to say that. The hon. the Minister is looking into these matters, and he is considering what we can do to send matters in that direction, but what has the Government done as far as certain schemes are concerned&#x003F; The Orange River scheme is not the only one. Enormous sums of money have been spent on irrigation schemes and therefore we have to pay more tax. R450 million is being spent on building the Orange River scheme. We are not paying for the scheme with washers; we need money to build it, and therefore we have to pay more tax. Think of the Makatini Flats. Speaking of development, it is ironical that a number of years ago there were very few Whites and Bantu living in the Vaalharts area. Then it was decided to start an irrigation scheme at Vaalharts. The hon. member said that we were making the rural areas black with Bantu. We then got the opportunity to build an irrigation scheme at Vaalharts. What is the position today&#x003F; At the towns of Vaalharts, Jan Kempdorp and the entire settlement there are 5,520 Whites and 21,325 Bantu and Coloured people today. It is in the nature of our agriculture, particularly in the case of labour-intensive irrigation land, that there have to be Black labourers as well. I want to warn hon. members in advance that they need not think that the Orange River scheme will result in the population there becoming whiter. There will also be a certain influx of Blacks, because their labour is required there.</p>

<p>I have told hon. members previously, and I want to repeat, that the person who is near to the heart of this Government is the small producer. He is the person who is satisfied with not enjoying continual economic prosperity, as the man in the city does. The sympathy of the Government lies with the small farmer in the rural areas. Last year we tried to protect that small farmer. We asked the hon. the Opposition to assist us in doing so. There are large consortiums which are swallowing up these small farmers, and the hon. member for East London (City) referred to this. We want to help them, to take just one industry, by saying that they may not keep more than 10,000 laying hens per year. The hon. member laughs, but this is a serious matter to me. Hon. members on the opposite side opposed that measure tooth and nail at the time. Therefore they did not care whether the small man went under as long as they could get eggs cheaply from large companies. Today the hon. member comes along and adopts this attitude. The hon. member for Fauresmith and others referred to all the assistance which the Government is offering in the form of agricultural credit. A great deal of criticism has been levelled at the Government. It has even been said that the stock withdrawal scheme is in fact only a bluff. Yet the number of farmers who entered for the stock reduction scheme stood at 2,760 at the end of December, 1970. Quite a number of applications are still awaiting formal approval. The area of the farms already participating in the scheme is 9,300,000 hectare. Stock already withdrawn comes to 1,105,000. The total number of persons participating in the veld reclamation scheme is 2,511 and the area of the farms entered, is 9 million morgen. Camps not used were 2&#x00BD; morgen in extent and the total expenditure up to 31st March, 1970, was R2,123,000. Because of the fact that the farmer is only paid out after six months, this amount is going to be considerably higher. This is the assistance which the Government is offering because of the very fact that it realizes what constitutes one of the major problems of the farmers. The hon. member talks about placing agriculture on a sound footing again. Just imagine! How does one place agriculture on a sound footing if you <span class="col_987-988" refersTo="page_0507"/>are faced with certain problems&#x003F; Over the past 20 years our population growth has been 2.36 per cent per year. The growth of agricultural production was 3.96 per cent per year. We are producing surpluses and where must they go to&#x003F; I know that hon. members on the opposite side are continually referring to prices and making suggestions as to how we can keep our agriculture sound. From 1948 to 1968 the prices of agricultural produce rose by 2 per cent per year on an average, while production costs rose by 2.35 per cent per year on an average.</p>

<p>One can make a living if you are a good farmer. It is easy to ask, &#x201C;How can one make a living&#x003F;&#x201D; What are we to do if the price of petrol rises and if the overseas price of a product which has to be exported is lower than the domestic price&#x003F; In 1946 a White Paper was issued by the office of the then Prime Minister, the late Gen. Smuts. I have a high opinion of this White Paper, because it was a practical one and stood with both feet on the ground as far as prices were concerned. In it the following is stated (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only when a higher level of productivity is achieved, a higher level of income and of labour can become permanent in our agriculture; only then will the consumers benefit and can farming contribute tangibly to reducing the high cost structure which at present so often retards development in the Union. While the Government aims at offering economic stability to the agricultural industry and at maintaining a fair price ratio between agricultural and other products, these things must be brought about within the natural limitations of our country, and the prices will have to be in reasonable proportion to world prices. We must combat all the causes of the present low productivity&#x2014;whether they be ignorance, inefficiency or wasteful exploitation. We cannot ensure a prosperous agricultural community by means of a price policy only.</block>

<p>Gen. Smuts&#x2019;s office said this, and hon. members on the opposite side must bear this in mind when we discuss these matters and when we talk of placing our agriculture on a sound footing again. Mr. Speaker, in spite of all these factors South African agricultural production has doubled in the past 10 years. This afternoon an hon. member asked who could get up and say he was standing in a queue in order to obtain a piece of meat. Which hon. member has ever gone to bed hungry for one night&#x003F; Not one of them. All of them are well-fed, fat and sleek.</p>

<p>Sir, we must be realistic. That is why I say that the Government realizes that one cannot allow indiscriminate depopulation to take place. An hon. member said here that the farmer himself should also do something about the matter. He should look to the industry and the shopkeeper in his small rural town. We sometimes have to search our own hearts too. We must not use arguments of this kind for political gain. The farmers are shrewd. They catch hon. members out when they come to them with these stories. While we are talking about wool, the Opposition must at the same time bear in mind that there are other industries too which are developing in competition with agriculture. The hon. member for Newton Park referred to the &#x201C;non-production&#x201D; in America, where a farmer is paid not to produce.</p>

<p>It has not proved to be a success. An American publication, <i>Foreign Agriculture,</i> says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Changes in the world agricultural situation have dictated the market-orientated shift. Synthetic and substitute products are posing a market threat to more and more farm products. Cotton has lost most of its market growth to man-made fibres. Fishmeal and urea compete with soya bean meal. Plastics compete with leather. And scientists are working on such exotics as a way to produce protein from algae fed on petroleum. U.S. efforts to hold down production have been offset, too, by increased production in other countries. Australia has doubled its wheat acreage in recent years&#x2014;increasing wheat output by about the same amount we have reduced ours.</block>

<p>These are the Americans who pay their farmers 157 billion dollars not to produce. Then the other countries came along and <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_0508"/>said, &#x201C;Now we have a market again&#x201D;. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Thailand has increased its corn production from 500,000 tons to 2.5 million tons in the past decade, while the United States was trying to hold hack feed grain production. The Common Market countries produced 11 million tons more grain in 1969-70 than they did in 1966- &#x2019;67. The competition for world farm product markets has grown much keener. At the same time, the productive capacity of U.S. farms is growing.</block>

<p>I say to that hon. member over there at the back, who asked how one can make ends meet in the face of higher production costs, that it applies to all these countries, but he and the hon. member for Newton Park scornfully referred to the fact that we speak of efficiency. I shall talk about it until I am blue in the face, because I am not prepared to represent an industry here in which one can simply allow inefficiency. The farmers have also grown tired of the stories that one can simply say that we should have a system in terms of which we should spoonfeed the inefficient person. That person must go to the city. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nearly everything the American farmer does to boost his efficiency also increases his ability to produce. More fertilizer, better seed varieties, irrigation, and many other improvements add to our production potential. Just in the past 10 years, yields per acre in the United States have risen 25 per cent, and meat production has increased 28 per cent. Output per man-hour in farming tripled.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Minister says here that we must work harder, hon. members laugh. I say that if the American farmers can treble their labour turnover, the farmers in South Africa, too, are prepared and able to do this out of pride in their country and nothing else, not political gain either. But we must reach the stage once again where we say to the farmers, as the hon. members for Graaff-Reinet and Fauresmith said, &#x201C;Do not come here with sob-stories. We know them. We are aware of the problem in certain Karoo areas.&#x201D; There are some very unfortunate farmers. The hon. member asked what assistance was being granted. He referred to the Prime Minister and said that he had made certain promises at the Sundays River Valley. That is an entirely incorrect insinuation. We have granted special assistance in the areas of Laingsburg, Sutherland, Prince Albert, Beaufort West, Willowmore, Steytlerville and part of Uniondale. Additional assistance has now been granted specifically to the Sundays River Valley. In terms of that assistance uncreditworthy farmers receive an allowance of R35 per husband, R35 per wife, R10 per child and R4 per Bantu labourer per month. All of this is non-repayable. This is an out and out grant because we know that those people are down on their knees due to climatic conditions, but do hon. members know how those people feel when they receive such a grant&#x003F; Do they think it is pleasant to have to receive such a grant&#x003F; If this Government did not care for the rural population, it would just have sat back and folded its arms and those people would have had to leave the rural areas. However, we realize that we have to plan in order to keep the people there as far as is practically possible.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by telling the hon. member that we may reproach each other in the political field, but one thing is certain, and that is that the conscience of this Government will always be clear when it comes to those who have to earn a living from agriculture, and more specifically, when it comes to the protection which is necessary to guard against the depopulation of the rural areas by the smaller man. Depopulation will take place. It is an economic law throughout the world. A sifting process is taking place. In 30 years&#x2019; time we will have to feed 50 million people in this country. Therefore it is the person who farms in the most efficient way who will make a success of agriculture, but if we were to listen only to negative talk, we would do our own industry a great deal of harm.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that the hon. the Deputy Minister has entered the debate so early. I would have liked to hear him summing up at the end. I am also sorry that both he and the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet apparently did not fully grasp the motion before the House. I believe that it is a very excellent motion. It strongly urges the Government &#x201C;to consider the advisability of, <i>inter alia,</i> curbing the depopulation or rural areas, caused by the movement of Whites by&#x2014;(a) placing the agricultural industry on a sound footing; (b) stimulating the development of commerce and industry in <span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0509"/>these areas; and (c) taking the necessary steps to increase confidence in these areas&#x201D;. Both those hon. gentlemen dealt with the motion entirely from the agricultural point of view. The motion is much broader and more important than that. I was aware of a tone of anger in the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s speech, and I am quite sure that that anger was probably engendered by the tears in his heart because he knows that we do have troubles. I believe that he is sincerely hoping to overcome these troubles sooner or later.</p>

<p>As I have said, the importance of this motion is not confined only to the platteland, but to the whole Republic of South Africa and its future economic and political stability. Here I feel bound to return to what I had to say during the no-confidence debate. At the time I spoke of the vital importance of overall planning and the crying need for some portfolio that can override and disentangle the mass of interdepartmental red tape which has come about as a result of departmental empire building on the one hand and by over-legislation in many spheres. In order to plan reliably for the future, one Minister and one department must have many facts at their fingertips, and they must be able to influence many factors. The facts they must have can only be obtained by a full survey of the socio-economics of all regions of the Republic of South Africa, a full survey of the soil and veld coverage and the topography of each area and a complete hydrological survey of all these areas.</p>

<p>In other words, no planning can be done without a full knowledge of the ecology of all the areas concerned. The role of ecologist has not yet been fully appreciated in this country and I believe it is high time that all departments started attracting qualified ecologists to senior posts within their department so that they can assist in the proper planning for the future. The factors in which such a department, as I envisage, should have direct and undisputed interest are both the animate and the inanimate but these factors are vitally important to the creation and the maintenance of infrastructures.</p>

<p>I speak, Sir, first of all of labour which is an animate factor and a human factor and which at the present moment, in the case of both White and Coloured labour, is under the control of the Minister of Labour, while all classes of Bantu labour are directly controlled by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. It is of vital importance that the control and movement of all labour should be controlled by one department so that we can develop in an orderly fashion, so that we can know where our labour is, so that we can know where it is required and so that these factors can be balanced, the one against the other.</p>

<p>Other factors, Sir, are the supply of electricity, reticulated water and communications, all of which are inanimate factors but which are of basic importance to human endeavour in practically every sphere of development in the modem world. These, Sir, are the requirements of a Government that genuinely wishes to decentralize industrial development; these are the basic needs for the future stabilization of the platteland and the peaceful and ordered development of the whole Republic. I believe that such a development, aided by a department with such powers as I have sketched, is long overdue in the Eastern Cape, the Midlands and the so-called Border, but I have stressed the importance of this in other debates and I do not wish to take up the time of the House unnecessarily today, except to say that I shall return to different aspects of this development during the Committee Stage of the Budget debate later this year. But, Sir, why has it become necessary to have this motion on the Order Paper&#x003F; Why has the platteland suddenly become depopulated&#x003F; Why has the enrolment at our agricultural colleges and universities suddenly dropped so alarmingly&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. H. D. DEACON</person>:</from>

<p>I hear it has happened at other places too. Perhaps the Minister will be able to get back at me because I am coming to the agricultural aspects of it now. Sir, all of us in this House who know anything about farming agree that one of the reasons was the widespread and prolonged drought over vast areas of this country. But, Sir, that is not a reason in itself. We have had droughts and far worse droughts than this in the past, and we have overcome them without such a huge depopulation as we have had this time. I believe that the reasons are a lack of co-ordinated planning and the fact that the Department of Agriculture have over many years based their policy on the premise that we should, like the United States, reduce our farming population to a <span class="col_993-994" refersTo="page_0510"/>percentage of approximately 6 per cent to 8 per cent of the total population. Sir, no agricultural economist has been able to tell me whether this percentage is based on White people actively engaged in agriculture against the total White population, or whether it is the percentage of White people actively engaged in agriculture against the whole population, or whether it is all people engaged in agriculture and their families who live on farms. Sir, how can this percentage be worked out anyway when the hon. the Minister cannot tell me how many White people are actively engaged in agriculture&#x003F; I draw the attention of the House to Question No. 232 which was replied to on Friday last, where I asked the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How many White people are actively engaged in farming in the various provinces in South-West Africa&#x003F;</block>

<p>The reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At this stage my department has no figures available in this respect and also has no basic information available to make a reasonable estimate.</block>

<p>Sir, this surprises me; it surprises me intensely because if the hon. the Minister cannot give me those figures how can he plan&#x003F; It also surprises me, because I know there is an annual agricultural census from which these figures can be extracted. However, the South African Agricultural Union can tell us approximately how many there are in the whole of the Republic and they put the figure at more or less 85,000 White farmers in the whole of the Republic. These are the farmers who are left on the land. If you take this as a percentage of the present White population of 3.8 million, it works out at 2.2. per cent. But if you take it as a percentage of the whole population of the Republic of 20 million, it is .42 per cent of White people actively engaged in farming who are left on the land.</p>

<p>Sir, what has this policy of reducing the numbers in fact brought about&#x003F; It has in fact forced the economic brain force of agriculture&#x2014;the White farmer&#x2014;off the land and into the cities, never to return, and it has left the untrained and uneducated labour force of non-Whites behind. The Minister told us what was happening at Vaalhartz and what the numbers were. This is what is worrying us; this is one of the reasons why we introduced this motion; it is this imbalance that has arisen; the non-White population on the platteland has gone up while the White population has been reduced. This is unhealthy, Sir, and both sides of the House must agree. That is why we have the second leg of the motion, which asks for industrial development to hold such Whites as can be used there and to employ the excess of the non-White labour that can no longer be employed in modern, up-to-date intensive farming activities. I suggest that the Minister and his economists have a very careful look at this situation and that they revise their policies before it is too late and before they find that they have destroyed the soil of the nation by ruining its farming stock.</p>

<p>Sir, in making my next point, which also has to do with agriculture, I wish to make it very clear that I have the fullest faith and the fullest confidence in the members of the staff of the departments of agriculture. These are dedicated men who are doing their duty often under very trying circumstances. But the point I wish to make is this, and it arises out of another question which I put to the hon. the Minister as to the distribution of the professional and technical staff of his Departments in the Republic.</p>

<p>Taking the professional staff, one finds that out of the total of 1,453 distributed throughout the Republic and the Territory of South-West Africa, 698 or 48 per cent are stationed in the Transvaal. We realize that there are more farmers in the Transvaal, but I am convinced that they do not comprise 48 per cent of our farming population. In any case, when one realizes that 490 of the 698 comprising 33.7 per cent of the total professional staff are stationed in Pretoria and in the vicinity of Pretoria, one realizes that the Transvaal is not so well off after all and that just over a third of our agricultural men are stuck behind a desk in the capital city, when they could be out in the field advising farmers and assisting farmers to overcome their difficulties.</p>

<p>Surely this is a top-heavy organization. The balance seems quite absurd, and it is my belief that the Minister should get down to a little reorganization and redistribution of his professional staff. It seems shocking that over a third of our professional men in the field of agriculture are stuck in a single city. I cannot see the reason for it. One realizes that this is the headquarters of Government and that your senior staff <span class="col_995-996" refersTo="page_0511"/>must be there, but surely 33 per cent is a very high percentage to keep in one place.</p>

<p>Yes, I realize that, but it is still a high percentage. There seems to be an imbalance and I think the hon. the Minister must go into it. It would certainly restore confidence if you could get more men into the field. I realize that the department is very understaffed too. If you can get more men into the field to go and see the farmers to restore their confidence, it will be a good thing, visits from professional men will assist not only the farmer but also the department in understanding the farmers in many areas better. There are many areas which do not have full-time services and many areas which are far too large for the officers to get around in. The proportion in this country is far higher and certainly does not compare with the little country to the north of us, Rhodesia.</p>

<p>*Finally, after putting all these points, I feel it is quite essential and practical to move the light industries to the rural areas in order to stabilize our population in the rural areas and to ensure that there is no further depopulation of the rural areas. We believe that the farming industry is in a very difficult position. We hope the situation will improve after the rains have come. We also hope that the position will be improved through the application of better methods and through better marketing conditions. As a matter of fact, I feel it would be a tragedy if the present tendency were to continue, and it is tragic to think that, if the present situation were to continue. the poets of the future would probably no longer be able to write &#x201C;O, Boereplaas, geboortegrond&#x201D;, but &#x201C;O, Blaar se woonstel, geboortetronk&#x201D;!</p>

<speech by="#horn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. L. HORN</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House probably appreciate it most sincerely that the United Party is concerned about this matter. We are glad and we appreciate it that they too are taking an interest in this matter, because it affects our entire nation. But I do not think they are really concerned about this matter. I think they are more concerned about the depopulation of the United Party in the rural areas. We on this side have for many years been concerned about the fact that depopulation of the rural areas is taking place, and accordingly the matter has for many years been receiving the attention of the authorities. But what was the object of this motion which the United Party moved here&#x003F; Its object was the same as that of the hon. member for Berea the other day in connection with drugs. They know that the Government is already paying a tremendous amount of attention to certain problems that exist and now they want to give out that they are drawing the public&#x2019;s attention to them and that all of a sudden they are the people who are concerned about these conditions. Now the United Party has to create the impression that they are particularly concerned about the depopulation of the rural areas, especially in those areas in which my constituency is situated; because recently they made every possible attempt in every possible field to catch a few votes for the election. Last year, when the Government and the Minister tackled the basic problem causing the depopulation of the rural areas, those hon. members and that hon. member were the people who opposed that legislation and the attempts that were being made to check this depopulation, an example being the hon. member&#x2019;s statement that he would fight that legislation tooth and nail. Even at that time we predicted that the hon. member would come back to this House to cover up that sin of his to some extent. After all, we know what has been happening in my constituency in recent times. If you consider the lower reaches of the Orange River, where there are 250 farmers in my area who previously had to make a living on holdings of 6 to 7 morgen, which have in the past 20 years been converted into units of 15 to 16 morgen, which is still not an economic unit today, it is clear that the number of farmers necessarily had to decrease by two-thirds. Why then does he want to express the view and give out that the Government is partly responsible for this turn which the depopulation of the rural areas has taken&#x003F; There have been the droughts which contributed to the depopulation of the rural areas, but the hon.<span class="col_997-998" refersTo="page_0512"/>member for Newton Park has, as far as I know, for the past 10 years been opposing the Government&#x2019;s attempts to prevent it. This is not what he did 10 years ago. Then the position was different. Then he agreed about the problems to which the depopulation of the rural areas is due. I have it with me and I can read it out to him. Then he agreed that the greatest problem in South Africa was that the farmers had uneconomic units, which would in time lead to the depopulation of the rural areas. What did the hon. member say in 1962&#x003F; Then he proved with figures that the depopulation of the rural areas would under the present circumstances increase each year, and when the Government made an attempt to check this depopulation, he was the first to stand up here and fight that law tooth and nail. They realize that they contributed nothing in the past towards checking this depopulation. Hence this motion, with which they are now again trying to induce people to support the United Party. I think this motion is a motion of self-reproach, a motion emanating from the United Party&#x2019;s feeling of guilt, particularly in the case of the hon. member for Newton Park. I think they have been arguing all along that if they leave this situation as it is, they can take the opposite side and always go against the Government whenever it presents itself as a problem, in order to try to ensure that those who may be dissatisfied, will always be on their side. What efforts have recently been made by these people who want to prevent the depopulation of the rural areas&#x003F; They are moving this sort of motion in Parliament merely because they no longer have any support in the rural areas. It is the National Party which has always had close ties with the soil and with the people on it, which will continue to have close ties with the soil and will not forever be striving after the benefits of growth and prosperity, but, as the hon. member said here, for which these things such as the depopulation of the rural areas are matters of serious concern. Our basic problem in connection with the depopulation of the rural areas has always been, as I said, uneconomic units; this inevitably led to a decrease in the number of farmers in our parts. The total area represented by farms smaller than 100 morgen increased from 563,000 morgen in 1927 to 951,000 morgen in 1954. If these are the conditions that have prevailed, how can the number of farmers be expected to stay the same and not decrease&#x003F; Hundreds of thousands of farmers have found themselves unable to make a living on such uneconomic units. Thank God that in South Africa, owing to its development under the National Party Government, we have been able to guarantee these farmers a living and to absorb them into the industries and the economy of our country.</p>

<p>There have also been other factors contributing to the decline of the farmers. I want to ask whether the United Party will support a proposal that under the circumstances we should write off farmers&#x2019; debts completely. Will they support us if we put forward such a proposal&#x003F; They must tell us now. Prosperity, too, has led to much of the small-farmers&#x2019; land being bought up, because these farmers could sell their land at good prices and did not have to get rid of it at low prices. The good prices they obtained enabled them to start a new life. The greatest depopulation in our history, i.e. 22 per cent, took place in the fifties. In these years we enjoyed the greatest prosperity in this country.</p>

<p>The extravagant spirit of the times has also contributed to this and left its mark on the farming community. All the people who used to own these small units in former years, today have motor cars, which they did not have then. Today they have light deliveries, cars, lorries, stereo sets, deep freezes, telephones and electric lights. All these people with their small pieces of land, who previously were unable to afford these things, have fallen prey to the spirit of the times and have also bought these things, while sometimes they could probably least afford them under the circumstances. It should be very clear to the Opposition that in this connection the National Party Government is going to succeed, by means of its policy, in bringing stability to the farmers&#x2019; economy in the rural areas. They know that the Government&#x2019;s policy is such that this will come about. Now they are afraid of lagging behind in future because they opposed these matters which were of importance to the farmers in providing them with an economic subsistence.</p>

<p>What was the United Party&#x2019;s contribution, during the 15 years they were in power, towards preventing this state of affairs&#x003F; I am not talking about farmers who had not yet taken up farming at that time. I do not know whether the hon. member who moved the motion today, was farming at that time. Hon. members may ask the <span class="col_999-1000" refersTo="page_0513"/>hon. member for East London what the situation was. I concede that the current prices of products are not high enough to extricate the farmers from this problem, but let us compare wool prices and other prices in the days of the United Party government with current prices. Now it is the United Party which is so concerned that it wants to move this motion on agriculture. Prior to 1948 our wool prices were approximately 8 cents a pound under the agreement. Hon. members have heard from that hon. member what our wool prices are today. Let us look at meat prices. The price received by the South African farmer when the United Party was in power, was 8&#x00BC; cents a pound for super lamb. That was their ideal price! Grade I lamb was 7&#x00BD; cents a pound; mutton was 7 cents a pound. These were the guaranteed prices. While the depopulation of the rural areas was beginning to increase, these people were not concerned about the prices farmers were receiving for their products at that time. What were the trade prices then&#x003F; These prices were so high that people could not buy meat. The prices ranged from 50 cents to R1 a pound. Today the general marketing price of meat is approximately 320 per cent higher than the meat prices of that time. If this is not proof that this Government has done its duty towards the farmers, as against the Opposition&#x2019;s unconcern while they were in power, why then do they want to move a motion today which creates the impression that this Government is not interested in the farmers&#x003F; No, a party and a government are not judged by their motions and their promises; a party and a government are judged by their deeds over the years. Therefore I ask the United Party to convert their arguments and promises into deeds and thus prove to us that they too want to contribute something positive in the interests of South Africa and its farmers. The pious and popular speeches which are being made cannot save the farmers of South Africa. Realistic ideas and sound judgment alone can place the farmers of South Africa on a sound footing again.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Prieska, who has just sat down, has tried to couple this very sensible motion moved by the hon. member for Newton Park with an allegation that we are trying to make politics out of what is a very important subject affecting very large areas of South Africa. I think we must be grateful to the hon. member for Newton Park for having moved this motion and thus focusing the attention, not only of this hon. House, but also of the people outside, on a subject that must enjoy the attention of all those who are connected with the well-being of agriculture in South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not think that we can claim despite all these measures the Government claims it has brought forward, that this question of the &#x201C;ontvolking&#x201D; of the platteland is being stopped. It is a matter for serious consideration. It is not only that farmers are leaving their farms; the serious aspect of the matter is that they are leaving the platteland altogether. They are going to the big cities. Some of our very big farmers, some of the people who are the backbone of South Africa, are being forced off the land due to economic difficulties. I believe that steps have to be taken to try and curb this tendency. I should like to try, in the minute or two at my disposal, to persuade the Government to take more active steps and to enlist the services of the hon. the Minister of Planning to conduct more investigation into ways and means of stopping this trend. I acknowledge that some farmers will have to leave their farms. However, what I do not acknowledge is that they have to leave their farms and go to the big cities. I believe that if proper investigation is done, ways and means of decentralizing industry to our small up-country towns will be found where that industry will be placed in a position to give these farmers who are perhaps forced to leave the land, work in the platteland itself. This is important not only for the sake of decentralizing our industry, but it is also important to save the cluttering up of our cities which are already becoming very big. We do not want to repeat the problem of big cities in America. That we want to avoid at all costs. We have space in South Africa. We have fresh air in South Africa, but our big cities are getting polluted. Why must we therefore allow this drift to the big cities to continue if it is not absolutely necessary&#x003F;</p>

<p>I feel the hon. member for Newton Park has done a service by moving this motion. I believe the debate has been a fruitful one. It has focused attention on a serious problem. At this stage I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>During the course of the debate yesterday afternoon, four things became clear. Firstly, that there is a shortage of accommodation&#x2014;not only in Pietermaritzburg, with which I am directly concerned, but throughout the Republic. That this is so is being brought forcibly to our attention by the fact that the Minister is now forced to purchase blocks of flats rather than perform his true function and provide accommodation for the people by the provision of the necessary number of housing units.</p>

<p>The second point which became clear from yesterday&#x2019;s debate is that the Minister and his department are either unable or unwilling to alleviate this position. Why, Sir, is he not building his own accommodation to provide accommodation for civil servants&#x003F; After all, it is his responsibility, and that he has accepted. All of us accept that under certain circumstances, as in the case of Pietermaritzburg, it is his responsibility and that of his department to provide accommodation for the medical personnel of the Edendale hospital. He must have known for some time that this is his responsibility because it was some time back that the Department of Bantu Administration took over Edendale hospital and that the Provincial Administration of Natal notified the personnel that they could no longer occupy the accommodation which they are presently occupying. But yet he has done nothing to find alternative accommodation except to move in and buy a block of flats in Pietermaritzburg and to eject the people concerned.</p>

<p>The third point which became clear from yesterday&#x2019;s debate is that no protection is afforded to tenants of rent controlled flats if their flats are purchased by this Minister&#x2019;s department. But what did the hon. the Minister say on the 5th February in reply to a question from the hon. member for Durban (Point)&#x003F; He was asked by this hon. member whether &#x201C;tenants in expropriated buildings were not accorded the fundamental protection granted by the Rents Act once ownership was taken over by the Government&#x201D;. The reply of the Minister thereto was &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

Minister and his department can move in, purchase a block of flats and immediately the protection afforded by the Rents Act is gone. So, no one is safe from his department.</p>

<p>But there is still a fourth point, and perhaps the most iniquitous of all. It is that after having removed the protection of the Rents Act the hon. the Minister does not want to accept the responsibility of finding suitable alternative accommodation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>In an attempt to defend the charge made by the hon. member for Germiston (District) in regard to the desperate housing conditions before 1948, the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) accused us of not knowing what it is to wage a war. He is correct&#x2014; since 1948 there has been no war, and we are grateful for that. But, and this I want to tell him, we know what it is to wage a cold war. Ever since the National Party had to take over the virtually insolvent estate of the United Party in 1948, we have been involved, year after year, in a cold war with a negative Opposition, an Opposition which has been trying year after year to hamper this Government in its attempts at ensuring growth and stability in South Africa. The Opposition has tried to thwart all the attempts made by this National Government; Iscor was opposed, Sasol was opposed. An attempt was even made to oppose our becoming a Republic in South Africa. Now it seems as though the other side of this House also wants to thwart the Government in its attempt to combat inflation. Sir, I say that we have been involved in a cold war for 23 years. It is no wonder that we are saddled today with an Opposition numbed with cold. [Interjections]. I shall deal with the hon. member for Durban (Point) in a moment. The hon. the Prime Minister was justified in asking: What would the world have thought of South Africa if it listened to the United Party only&#x003F; During the no-confidence debate hardly a single good word was put in for South Africa on that side. That was the position not only in that debate, but also in this debate.</p>

<p>In the past the United Party did co-operate&#x2014;I can think of one example only &#x2014;when an appeal was made to the people to be thrifty. Last year, the Water Year, another appeal was made to the people to save, and in that respect the United Party co-operated beautifully, but why&#x003F; They co-operated because they knew that it would have fatal results for them at the polls if they opposed that appeal for economy in their customary manner. This year, when an equally important appeal is being made to the people to save, the United Party is making a farce of it. In this debate up to now hon. members on that side of the House, particularly the hon. member for Durban (Point), have been trying to make a mockery of this appeal. Yesterday afternoon he referred here to the emotional speech made by the hon. member for Worcester, but in an equally emotional, dramatic speech he himself put a question which he asked the Government to answer. The question was: Does the Government expect the old age pensioners and the lower income group to save&#x003F; Sir, this side of the House does not expect every group to deposit hard cash in a savings account, but this National Party Government has no hesitation in asking every person in every group to practise thrift, even in regard to the essential necessaries of life. Sir, because we in South Africa have been experiencing such a large measure of prosperity, a tendency has developed for some of our people&#x2014;I do not say all of them&#x2014;to indulge in being wasteful. That wastefulness, in many spheres&#x2014;from food to soap, from motorcar tyres to electricity&#x2014;is a disgrace, but it is more of a disgrace when a member on that side of the House asks in this House by way of interjection: Why should we save&#x003F; Sir, we must save for the sake of the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>The youth was mentioned by several speakers on this side as well as that side of the House. The hon. the Minister of Community Development rightly said that the young people had to learn to live within the limits of their own income. I myself also fall under that group of young people, and I am grateful to be able to say that there is still a group of young people who are prepared today to build their future in South Africa in a systematic and planned manner, who do not have the urge to start doing everything at once. In fact, I would like to make an appeal to these young people: Let us always hold up to ourselves that adventure of saving in such a manner that we can buy the essential things in cash, in the knowledge that such things are our own and are not being shared with a finance company. Sir, when that adventure, that ideal to be realized one day, no longer exists for our young people, there is a danger that they may become frustrated, and frustration is an ugly thing. It is something we see on the other side of the House every day.</p>

<p><span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0516"/>Let us ask the United Party to help us in this attempt to save. Let them help us to save instead of going ahead with their manner of solving the problem: Throw open more gates to the non-Whites; throw open more gates to the male non-Whites and also bring their families to the cities so that they may lead normal family lives. Let them help us to save instead of saying at the polls, as they did in Randburg, &#x201C;If you want servants, vote for the United Party.&#x201D; We are in fact living in a time which is inclined to make one feel concerned and to examine oneself, concerned about the danger of inflation and what the future may hold if inflation is not checked in time, and examination so that each of us will make an effort to make, from his own modest station in life, his small contribution towards guaranteeing this country of ours a sound and stable economy.</p>

<p>Today I should like to try to plead with the hon. the Minister of Finance in regard to a sphere which also causes one concern, i.e. a certain part of the agricultural sector. I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to give consideration to granting assistance to the Land Bank in order that this bank may proceed to providing a more differentiated service. I want to tell you, Sir, that to my mind this concern stems from the possible danger that the agricultural industry may degenerate or may develop into an old industry, an old industry in the sense that the majority of the people practising this industry, are middle-aged or even elderly. In the economy warnings are continually being sounded against stagnation as well as excessive growth, with the ideal of a sound and vigorous growth. We should be thankful to our farming population for the sound growth they have been maintaining over the past number of years, at times even under the most impossible conditions imaginable, but from now onwards we shall have to think of helping this industry and ensuring that it will have vitality in the sense there will be a sufficient number of young farmers. It is gratifying to know that the Land Bank has a sympathetic ear for the young farmer, but this institution may, in fact, only take such steps as fall within the framework of what it is permitted to do. This afternoon I should like to plead with the hon. the Minister of Finance for the young farmers, and I am doing so on behalf of all the young farmers as well as the prospective young farmers, namely that the Land Bank should be assisted financially in order that it may, particularly in regard to its mortgage insurance scheme, proceed to a differentiated scheme as far as the premiums are concerned. The position at the moment is that a young farmer pays the same premiums as a farmer who is 60 or 65 years of age. Once a differentiated scheme can be introduced, it will involve a tremendous saving for our younger farmers, especially up to the age of 40.</p>

<p>I should like to quote from the Land Bank reports from 1955 onwards to show what a good and reasonable claim the younger farmer has to a differentiated scheme. In looking at the number of deaths and the claims paid out, one finds the following figures: From 1955 to 1965, i.e. a period of ten years, there were under this scheme, under the age group of 30 years, only 11 deaths out of a total of 2,741. The claims paid out amounted to R80,530 as against a total of R12,845,000. Even when one raises up the age limit to 40 years, one finds that there were only 61 deaths out of a total of 2,741, and that the claims amounted to R429,000 as against just over R12.8 million. Percentage-wise the deaths represent 2.2 per cent of the total and the claims paid out approximately 3.4 per cent of the total. We find these figures throughout, every year. I have now referred to the period from 1955 to 1965, but when we take it over a shorter period, we find that from 1965 to 1966 there were, under the age of 40, only four deaths out of a total of 270; the claims paid out only amounted to R16,950, which comes to an average of approximately R4 240 per claim. From 1966 to 1967 there were eight deaths out of a total of 325. From 1967 to 1968 there were ten deaths out of a total of 355, and from 1968 to 1969 there were only four deaths out of a total of 325. Therefore, from 1965 to 1969 there were 26 deaths out of a total of 1,285. I think that these figures speak for themselves and that they constitute a very good reason for asking the Minister to give consideration to granting the Land Bank the right to introduce a differentiated scheme on the basis of age as far as the tariffs are concerned.</p>

<p>Then there is another field I should like to embark upon, which I know is of a very drastic nature, but I have no hesitation in merely submitting the thought to the Minister. Any farmer, and particularly the prospective young farmer, finds himself in the difficult position today that, if he does not <span class="col_1007-1008" refersTo="page_0517"/>have land which he inherited, or if he does not have a fairly large amount of cash which he can obtain by other means, he is faced with the problem of raising out of his own savings the amount required for the purchase of land, the contribution he is required to make personally. I said at the beginning that we should try to keep our agricultural industry a young and vital one, but at present it is difficult for these young men to accumulate that nest-egg.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the problem of land prices which are still rising every year. The following passage was taken from the annual report of the Board of the Land and Agricultural Bank for 1965&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Investigation reveals that during the period 1959 to 1965 the average increases in the prices of properties purchased and re-sold in two homogeneous areas were 64.7 and 60.7 per cent, respectively. Maximum price increases in these areas, however, exceeded 400 per cent.</block>

<p>It is in this pattern, which is still going on, in which the young man has to assert himself if he wants to farm. In the past there were, to an even greater extent, opportunities for being financed by private institutions. But in the report of the Land and Agricultural Bank for 1969 the following is said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that in South Africa the matter of financing of agriculture has reached the cross-roads. The need for the Bank&#x2019;s financing is steadily increasing&#x2014;even in branches of farming where this need did not actually reveal itself in the past.</block>

<block name="quote">Financial institutions which thus far have made investments in the agricultural sector, but which under present circumstances can find more remunerative rates for investments elsewhere, cannot afford, because of the nature of their business, to forego these more lucrative investments. It is, therefore, increasingly expected of the Bank to provide the agricultural industry with a system of financing, and at a rate of interest best suited to its requirements.</block>

<block name="quote">The development of agriculture in South Africa has brought about circumstances which necessitate a re-orientation of financing practices in respect of the industry in general, and it is therefore with considerable interest that the Board awaits the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Fiscal and Monetary Policy in South Africa as also of the Commission of Inquiry into Agriculture, which commissions have already been appointed by the Government.</block>

<p>The young lad who is so inspired with the ideal of being a farmer one day, does manage to do so, but only at a stage when he has already reached middle age. He will therefore be middled-aged before he will have been able to save this 20 per cent of one-fifth of the purchase price.</p>

<p>I do not want to plead today for everything to be handed to these young men on a tray. But for the consideration of the Minister I should just like to ask whether it is not possible to make concessions to a young man who has trained himself in an agricultural school or college, or better still, a person who is in possession of a degree in agriculture, in the sense that his learning, his knowledge and his experience should be looked upon as forming part of the security required by the Land Bank. I know that what I am asking does not quite fit into the pattern of combating inflation. However, these two thoughts which I have mentioned to the Minister, will have very little or no influence on the inflation pattern against which we are guarding at the moment. One cannot expect these people, who apply for assistance, to be granted that assistance immediately, but consideration can be given to expecting them to remain for a period of, say, 10 to 15 years in the direct service of the agricultural industry as officials of the Department of Agriculture. When they apply subsequent to having rendered such service, it would be possible for the Minister to consider regarding their experience and agricultural training as a measure of security. At the moment the agricultural industry finds itself in a period of changing over to mechanization, which is exceptionally expensive. The longer one waits, the greater the leeway that will have to be made up. This is so much the greater for those who still have to save in order that they may eventually raise the required 20 per cent of the purchase price out of their savings. I know that the request I am making to the hon. the Minister is a drastic one. But of the approximately 114,000 White farmers in South Africa at present, only about 32 per cent are under the age of 40. This is a percentage which, with a view to the anticipated high demands of the future, will simply have to be pushed up.</p>

<p><span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0518"/>I want to conclude by saying that on a certain occasion ex-Minister S. P. le Roux said that a country that was looking after its agriculture, was looking after its future. Let us make sure now that we are looking after the future by guaranteeing the agricultural industry an energetic group of young men, who will have to see to it that the agricultural industry in South Africa will never become an old industry.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for Bethlehem will understand if I do not reply in any way to his speech. He was largely concerned with the future of agriculture in this country. I have a very different subject indeed that I want to raise in the House this afternoon.</p>

<p>The subject which I should like to raise is something rather far from the economic and financial aspects of the Part Appropriation Bill. I should like simply to say as far as that aspect is concerned, that the hon. the Minister is levying a very heavy additional indirect tax on South Africa. This method of raising money for the State, I believe, is only justified in a country where there is a fairly even spread of income. This cannot be said of South Africa where there is a large concentration of income in the hands of a small percentage of the total population. But the indirect taxes imposed by the hon. the Minister will be felt by everybody in this country. Therefore, I profoundly disagree with this method of raising the additional tax that the hon. the Minister needs. I want to say one other thing on the financial aspect, and that is that I hope in drawing up his estimates for the Budget in view of the increased cost of living in respect of all manner of goods which will be a direct and indirect result of the sales tax, he will consider reviewing pensions and more particularly the old-age pensions presently paid to the Africans in South Africa. The miserable R5 per month which is the maximum that an old-age African pensioner may receive, paid every two months, that is R10 paid every two months, is hopelessly inadequate for anybody to sustain himself at even the barest subsistence level. That is all I wish to say about the financial aspect of the Part Appropriation debate.</p>

<p>I want to take this early opportunity of raising a subject with the Government and more particularly with the hon. the Minister of Justice. This is the granting of amnesty to prisoners on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the Republic of South Africa. I asked the hon. the Minister the other day &#x2026; [Interjections.] I wish hon. members would go and talk outside. I asked the hon. the Minister the other day whether he was considering this and, if so, whether he intended including the so-called political prisoners among those persons who will be qualified to get amnesty&#x003F; He replied that the matter is still being investigated and it is therefore not possible to provide particulars thereof at this stage. I am hoping very much that the argument that I will put forward this afternoon will persuade the hon. the Minister that the decision which is to be taken as regards the amnesty to prisoners should not be the same decision that was taken both in 1961 when the Republic came into being and in 1966 on the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the formation of the Republic. On those two occasions political prisoners were excluded entirely from the amnesty that was granted to other persons.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, of course they were not the only ones. There were other categories of people who were also excluded. But irrespective of the case, the political group was excluded entirely. I hope that this will not be the case on the 10th anniversary. I want to make it quite clear to the hon. the Minister that I am not of course asking for a general amnesty for all political prisoners. That is quite obvious. However, what I am asking is that this class of political prisoner should not be excluded <i>en masse</i> when he considers the granting of amnesty and that each case will be treated on merit. That is what I am asking the hon. the Minister. I want to remind the hon. the Minister of something; not that I think he needs reminding, but perhaps the House needs reminding. Perhaps the House does not even know that most classes of ordinary criminals, although not all, are entitled to remission of sentence and to parole. However, political prisoners as a class are excluded from remission of sentence and from parole. They serve their full sentences except in very exceptional cases when the hon. the Prime Minister, then Minister of Justice, allowed one or two of the younger political prisoners to be released. It seems to me as a general rule that it is much better to be a prisoner who has been found guilty of all sorts of crimes such as attempted murder, assault, robbery <span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0519"/>and rape. Prisoners convicted of these crimes, under certain circumstances, are not excluded from remission and parole. But if one has committed and been convicted of a political crime, then all thought of remission of sentence is apparently put right out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind.</p>

<p>I should like to give the House some figures for the present situation. At present, according to the latest figures that I was able to obtain, namely the figures for September, 1970&#x2014;and there have obviously been changes since then&#x2014;there are about 800 persons serving sentences for so-called political offences in South Africa. At present there are 11 White political prisoners. They range from people like Bram Fischer and Goldberg who are serving life sentences, to others who are serving sentences of seven years and more. Two of these prisoners are in any case due to be released this year, one of them quite shortly and one of them towards the end of this year. The one due to be released towards the end of this year is Lewin whom the Minister knows and on whose behalf I have already made representations. This man has served six of his seven years, which were imposed on him in the courts of law. Under any other circumstances, if he was not a political offender, he would long ago have had remission of his sentence. He is an A-grade prisoner and I ask the hon. the Minister seriously in all the circumstances of this case in which he is well versed, to consider whether he will not grant amnesty to this prisoner. On Robben Island, as far as I have been able to ascertain, and according to the last information I have received in this regard, there were between 400 and 500 political prisoners. Of course they are non-Whites because Robben Island is a non-White prison.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Apart from people who are serving sentences for crimes against the State&#x2014;I hope that pleases the hon. the Prime Minister although the Department of Prisons used to use the expression &#x201C;political offenders&#x201D;; however, they are now known officially and technically as persons who are convicted of crimes against the security of the State&#x2014;there are people whose lives have been severely restricted by banning orders. No courts have come into this at all. They have never been found guilty of any crime; not of any crime of violence or of any other crime, but they are banned by ministerial edict. I submit that these people should also be considered when amnesty is granted. According to the latest consolidated list which was gazetted on the 30th June, 1970, there are some 280 people who are still banned. I am not talking of listed people now, but banned people. They do not all live in South Africa, but there are large numbers who still do.</p>

<p>Restricted people.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Restricted people then. I do not know why we are arguing about terminology, because everybody knows what I mean. When one talks of a banned person in South Africa it means a person whose movements are severely restricted by a banning order. Some people have since come off this list of 280 and, of course, others have come on, including the 19 people who were recently acquitted under the Terrorism Act. They have been given restrictive orders, some more severe than others. These restrictions extend from the simple restriction, prohibiting the attendance of meetings or entering certain premises, to the all-encompassing house arrest. The last list that was tabled in the House a couple of weeks ago reveals that at least 35 people are presently under house arrest in South Africa. People under house arrest and also those who are banned or restricted have all sorts of attendant difficulties, particularly in finding employment. Originally, when the house arrest clause was introduced in this House one of the explanations was that this was much kinder than sending a man to gaol, although he had never been tried or convicted, in that he would at least be able to continue with his employment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<p>We take that into consideration every time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>All the same, it means that employment opportunities are severely restricted. Whether the hon. the Minister knows it or not, when any person on this list finds employment they very often find that they are without it again because the prospective employer has been visited by the Special Branch who have warned the employer that the prospective employee is somebody whose political affiliations do not exactly meet with the approval of this Government.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject of people who are restricted or banned and under house arrest I would like to make a very special plea for one person, namely Mrs. Helen Joseph. She was the first person to be placed under house arrest in South Africa after the passing of the 1962 Act. This means in effect that Helen Joseph has been under home arrest for more than eight years which is more than 3,000 days, which is a very long time by anybody&#x2019;s reckoning. Under house arrest, she has to live completely alone and is not allowed to have visitors with the exception of a doctor. She has to be at home every night between the hours of 6.30 p.m. until 6.30 a.m. and on weekends from 2.30 p.m. on Saturday until 6.30 a.m. on Monday. The hon. the Minister has granted her two concessions. She is allowed to attend mass on Sundays and she was also allowed to take employment outside the magisterial district of Johannesburg. Other than that she has to report to the police every single day. Helen Joseph is 65 years of age today. If the present order runs its full length she will be 67 years of age when it expires in 1972. I say there is something singularly ugly about the spectacle of the Government appearing <span class="col_1015-1016" refersTo="page_0521"/>to bully and pursue an ageing woman like this. By all stretches of the imagination I find it very difficult to imagine that a woman of 65 years of age can be a danger to the Republic of South Africa or to the National Government.</p>

<p>Now what has this woman done&#x003F; Has she ever been convicted in a court of law for breaking any law in South Africa&#x003F; No, except for one. She was once sentenced to a suspended sentence and spent four days in gaol for which, I might add, she has been disfranchised for life. She spent four days in gaol because she forgot to report at the police station. That is the only time she has ever been convicted by a court of law. She was tried in a court of law but was found not guilty at the original Treason Trial. She has never even been declared to be a Communist and in fact she never was according to what she says and according to what was said by the Government agent, Ludi. He said that she has never been a member of the Communist Party. But she did belong to two Communist front organizations. [Interjections.] She admits this and makes no bones about it. But she belonged to those organizations when they were still legal organizations. It is only in this country, as far as I know, that people are punished in retrospect for belonging to organizations that are subsequently declared to be illegal. For the rest she has a history of service to South Africa. [Interjections.] I will tell the hon. member that it is a lot better than his record of service to South Africa. One of the things, for instance, is that she served in the South African Defence Force between the years 1942 and 1946 as a full-time welfare officer. She is a qualified social worker. She worked as a social worker for the South African War Memorial Fund after the war. Then she served as secretary for the Medical Aid Society of the clothing industry for 15 years. She was banned in 1957 and restricted to Johannesburg. She has never been a member of the Communist Party and she has never&#x2014;this is the important thing&#x2014;been convicted in a court of law. I believe that what the Government really has against her is that she has taken an interest in and has visited all those people who were banished under the Native Administration Act of 1927. I am coming to those poor people quite soon. I think it is a sickening story of harassment of a woman, who as I say, is no longer young. Her case is known throughout the world, and I want to say quite categorically that I cannot think of a single act of mercy or compassion that this Government could do which would do more good for South Africa than releasing Mrs. Joseph from her house arrest order. She can be watched if the Government is nervous. I am quite sure that she will commit no crime. I think that she should be released now after eight years from the crippling house arrest and other bans that have reduced her life to a twilight existence of loneliness. That is exactly what it is. I ask the hon. the Minister to give special consideration to the case of Helen Joseph.</p>

<p>Now what about the people that Mrs. Joseph made her special concern&#x003F; What about the banished people&#x003F; This, I know, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister of Justice, but the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I am glad to see that the Deputy Minister is here. Maybe he will convey this plea to the hon. the Minister. As far as I know, there are 19 people who are still in banishment under the 1927 Native Administration Act. I know these cases are meant to be regularly reviewed, but I must say I find this very hard to believe when one considers the details about some of these cases. There are two people, the Mopelis, a husband and wife. They were banished from Witzieshoek to the remote trust farm at Frenchdale. The man has been in exile for 21 years&#x2014;quite a long time to be punished for whatever the sin was that he committed. It could be fighting against the tribal authorities or rebelling against some Government edict or a chieftain who was imposed on the tribe. I do not even know what the original sin was, but 21 years is a life time. Indeed, it practically is this man&#x2019;s life time, because he is today a very old man. His wife has been in banishment for 17 years. They are both very old people, indeed. For the rest, there is another one that has been in banishment for 17 years, one for 13 years, two for 11 years, three for 10 years and the remaining ten from six to nine years. I do hope the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education will see whether some of these cases, anyway, cannot be reviewed in terms of an amnesty, and see whether they cannot for their remaining years be sent back to the areas from which they were banished so long ago. As I say, nobody really knows what their sins were. They have never been tried in any court of law. They have been banished by ministerial edict. They have <span class="col_1017-1018" refersTo="page_0522"/>never been given a chance to defend themselves. As far as one can gather, their sin appears to be mostly that their presence was detrimental to peace as regards of tribal authorities. It is generally some internal tribal dispute that causes these people to be banished. How do they live, if one can call it living&#x003F; They are all banished to these remote farms. They either live on food or rations given to them by the Government if there is no work available. Mostly there is no work available in these areas. The allowance is R15 per quarter. On this amount these people are supposed to live. Many of them are already old and many of them are sick. As a matter of fact, some of them have died in banishment. It ought not to be too much to ask the Government when it is considering clemency to other people on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Republic to extend it to these people as well. While doing that they may also use their influence with Chief Matanzima to see to it that some people who were banished years ago&#x2014;some of them as long as 10 years ago&#x2014;under Proclamation 400, which is still in force in this nearly independent Transkei receive amnesty. This peace-loving Transkei has one of the most encompassing enabling Acts enabling the chiefs there to banish people. At the present moment there are 19 people under banishment in terms of that proclamation. Perhaps the Transkei would like to join in our Republican festivities and do something about these people as well.</p>

<p>Finally there is one other group of people whom I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister and to ask him to remember when he is considering amnesty. These are the people whose punishment is never ending. After having served the sentence which the courts of law thought fit to impose on them, they have another sentence served on them immediately they come out of prison and are banished to remote areas&#x2014;not banished, but sent away to remote areas in the Transkei and elsewhere where there are no opportunities of earning a livelihood. These people are not banished under the Act of 1927 and are not allowed to return to the cities where they were before. Many of these people are educated people and the most they can earn by doing road work is R16 per month. The result is that many of them are in dire straits indeed. I get many pitiful letters from people who have come off Robben Island after having served a sentence of imprisonment to find that their sentences are in fact never ending. The idea of rehabilitation, which I understand is one of the prime aims of our penal system, as it is the prime aim of every penal system of any modern country in the world, does apparently exclude this class of person entirely. Therefore I should like to ask the Minister to consider these as well.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that I will be called a sickly humanist, or perhaps something even more sinister&#x2014;indeed, the Prime Minister himself, with great subtlety, even hinted this afternoon in the House that I am something much more sinister. Well, I want to tell him and the rest of the House that I really do not care what people call me.</p>

<p>South Africa must take cognizance of the speech made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Houghton. Of course, I may not say that her speech was an inflammatory one, but it was very close to being one. Here we have a person who is supposed to be <span class="col_1019-1020" refersTo="page_0523"/>a responsible member of this House, and here she actually pleads for the continued existence of the peace-loving citizens of this country to be threatened. That is what the hon. member did here today. I am beginning to wonder whether democracy should not be reviewed so that this type of speech may be prohibited. We had here today a plea on behalf of those people who threatened the existence of every peace-loving citizen. She mentioned the names of Abram Fischer, of Mandela and of Mrs. Joseph, and if Harris had still been alive, I wonder whether she would have pleaded for him too, in spite of the innocent lives he took and the injuries inflicted at Park Station. Would she have pleaded for him too&#x003F; I think it is shocking that we should have here a plea of this nature, a plea that amnesty should be granted to people like this.</p>

<p>Who shot whom&#x003F; Unfortunately it was necessary to go to such lengths. One can only speak with admiration of the manner in which the Police behaved at that time. The hon. member is talking of something about which she knows nothing; she only read about it in her poisonous Press. If she is such a very good South African, why does she not speak to her friends, such as Kaunda, in regard to their attitude towards South Africa&#x003F; Then she would be acting like a patriotic citizen. On whose behalf is she pleading in this House&#x003F; She is not pleading on behalf of the electorate of South Africa, but only on behalf of a small number of agitators, enemies of the Republic. What the hon. member should have done in this regard was to devote a speech of praise of the hon. the Prime Minister for what he as Minister of Justice did in this country, for his having seen to it that we could go on living in peace and prosperity. That is what she should have done. But the hon. member must forgive me for not devoting any more of my time to her.</p>

<p>I want to come back to certain announcements made by the hon. the Minister. Like political vultures the Opposition immediately fell on them to see whether they could not make some political capital out of the position prevailing in the country today. They paid special attention to two aspects in particular. In the first place, they intimated their displeasure with the measures taken by the hon. the Minister to reduce consumer spending in the country in an attempt to control inflation. The solution, as they see it, is to accelerate the growth rate, as they put it, through the more effective utilization of our labour potential. Sir, how do they want to do it, and what does it imply&#x003F; It implies one thing, and that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition put here last year; he sees the solution in a &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;. He said, &#x201C;Utilize 20 million people and never mind the outcome of it.&#x201D; Sir, this is just what the United Party is like; let matters take their course. But at the same time they want to exploit this position, and when the hon. the Minister comes forward with proposals to raise the sales duty on certain luxury items, they think they can make party-political capital out of it. That is precisely how we know them&#x2014;a real parasitical political party. Sir, perhaps they are on to something, for if you touch the individual&#x2019;s pocket, he immediately is incited to some sort of revolt. But we know that that revolt is of a temporary nature, because any responsible citizen realizes, when he thinks the matter over, that the measures which have been taken are in his own interest and in the interest of his people and in the interests of his continued existence and that of the country. They think they can make some political capital out of these temporary <span class="col_1021-1022" refersTo="page_0524"/>levies. They hope to gain from the ranks of this 20 million protestors, as the mover of the amendment put it here, the votes of a few discontented persons. Sir, that is what they are yearning for, because they are satisfied with very, very little. Sir, as I know the voters of South Africa, I can tell you that they will drop the United Party like a hot potato because the vast majority of voters in South Africa are much more intelligent than the lot of rotten United Party members sitting here.</p>

<p>I withdraw that, Sir, I mean the Opposition sitting here. I want to refer, in the first place to the statements made here in regard to the increase in the sales duty. The Opposition must tell us straight out whether they want to return to the old system of direct taxation. No, they are keeping quiet. The hon. member for Florida proved in this House in 1969 that 85 per cent of the normal householder&#x2019;s monthly necessities were not affected by the sales duty, and up to today not one of the Opposition members has been able to refute that. When the sales duty was introduced, certain important concessions were also made to the tax-payers of South Africa. With the introduction of the sales duty those concessions were in fact made to the lower-income groups, to married couples, in cases where both parties are working. But the U.P. supporters are conveniently forgetting about these things. Take the scale of taxation as it was in 1947. I am taking the example of a married person with two children who earned R3,000 in the Transvaal. In terms of their system he would have paid R200, and after these concessions he is only paying R94, virtually 50 per cent less. These are the concessions that were made. Of the concessions that were made in 1969, 29 per cent went to the person who earned less than R5,000, and 42 per cent of those concessions went to the person who earned between R5,000 and R14,000; that is the married couple. And then the Opposition says that these concessions were not made to the person in the lower-income group. Yesterday the hon. member for Maitland said here, &#x201C;It is a pickpocket tax.&#x201D; Sir, every tax payer can exercise control over this tax.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, my time is very limited. As I said, it is being called a &#x201C;pickpocket tax&#x201D;; I say it is a tax over which every tax payer has control. The pensioner to whom they referred, does not buy a stove or a refrigerator every day; nor even a blade or a small cake of soap. They hope to catch votes in this manner. Sir, this is a non-recurring tax, but in making these concessions the State did in fact do what it was expected to do. They have made certain concessions which have assisted indirectly in enhancing productivity. Encouragement has now been given to that married couple, that professional man, the man who had a certain income and came onto a scale in which there was that bulge in our curve, i.e. encouragement to work again, for these people felt that everything they earned went to the tax collector. A concession was made in respect of married couples with an income of up to and including R8,000, but this is not being mentioned.</p>

<p>I say that members of the Opposition are of the opinion that they will be able to derive benefit from this dissatisfaction, but it will merely be of a temporary nature. If they think that they can ever come into power in that way, I may as well tell them now that they are still going to plod along in the political desert for a long time. I say that these gentlemen who are so concerned about the growth rate&#x2014;the hon. member for Bethlehem referred to this&#x2014; never showed any interest in the grow rate before the Republic of South Africa was established. No, at that time they saw South Africa as the milch-cow of the British Empire. [Interjections.] In 1927, when the Iscor legislation had to be placed on the Statute Book in order that we might manufacture our own steel, these people fought that move. It was rejected twice in the Senate, and it was necessary to have a Joint Sitting in 1928. No, at that stage growth did not matter, because it suited them at the time. At that stage they were the people who curbed growth, but today they are riding the horse of inflation. This applied not only to the steel industry, but also to Sasol. At a certain election Mr. Graham Eden issued a pamphlet to say that &#x00A3;11 million was being wasted. But when the Republic came into being, when this young Republic was established, what was the attitude they adopted to growth&#x003F; No, when the world was threatening us with boycotts, when we had these riots to which reference was made, they sat here <span class="col_1023-1024" refersTo="page_0525"/>and wanted to know what the world opinion would be. They said we would have unemployment. But at that stage there was no mention of a &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;, and they did not want to take part in the growth and the stimulation of the economy of this country. At the time their only hope was that the National Party would come to a fall because of these boycotts and these riots. That was their only germ of hope. They thought they would be able to come into power in that way.</p>

<p>We know that the attitude adopted by this Opposition is that they are merely thinking of themselves and not of South Africa as a country. The hon. member for Parktown wanted to know here what we intended doing with that R47 million. He said the State was unfit to spend it. It was to be left to the private sector, but in reply to an interjection he laid a charge sheet against the State and wanted to know why we had not built the Hex River Tunnel and why we had not raised the walls of the Vaal Dam. No, one minute they say one has to take the money out of the economy, and the next minute they say that we should pump money into it again.</p>

<p>I am now coming to another aspect, i.e. the third leg of their motion, which says that the Government should adopt a more realistic approach to the Republic&#x2019;s labour problems by promoting the more effective use of the country&#x2019;s labour resources. The hon. member for Parktown said that protests were heard against the National Party as the National Party no longer had a labour policy. This was said with reference to the recent exemptions in order to allow Coloureds to practise certain trades&#x2014;i.e. those of the bricklayers and the plasterers &#x2014;at the Witwatersrand, Pretoria and in certain parts of the Free State. We have never denied that there is a shortage in certain skilled trades. We know that. The hon. the Minister mentioned it here last year. The hon. the Minister and his Department of Labour have gone out of their way to meet the demand. In exceptional cases exemptions were granted. Recently more exemptions were granted. As I have said, I know that there is a shortage of certain artisans. But why is that&#x003F; In the industrial areas the bricklayers have left the building trade. They are going to the industries, where they have a guaranteed income, for in the building trade, their income is subject to the whims of nature. Whenever it rains, they earn no money. Then they have to stay away from work, whereas if they work in industry, they receive a guaranteed wage every day. There are, in addition, certain fringe benefits in industry. That is why many of the White artisans have left the building trade. This Government has introduced certain exemptions. It has come forward with encouragement by way of trade tests. It has granted adults the right to take certain steps in the industry. In spite of these things and in spite of the fact that the number of artisans in the building trade increased from 18,900 in 1962 to 35,000 in 1969, there is still a shortage of 4,700 artisans in the Transvaal, approximately 80 per cent of which is in the wet trades. The alarming fact is that during the years 1967 to 1969 only 30 bricklayers and six plasterers joined the trade as apprentices in the Transvaal. That is why it is necessary for the hon. the Minister to grant certain exemptions. I think it is necessary to emphasize that this is not to be regarded as a general exemption, but that it is being done subject to certain conditions. Because of certain exemptions having been granted, the United Party now accepts that job reservation has failed. The member for Parktown said, &#x201C;Give us the tools and we will do the job.&#x201D; What tools does the hon. member want&#x003F; I shall tell you, Sir, what he wants. He wants to use the spade of integration for opening up the channel of Black labour in order that it may flow into the stream of White labour and swallow it up in that manner. That is the tool they want to use. That is the spade of integration they want to use. The United Party believes in growth with an uncontrolled influx of non-White labour. As against that the policy of the National Party is the controlled employment of non-Whites in the White sector. The Government will always continue to protect the White workers, and job reservation will, just as in the past, be implemented when circumstances require. We know that these exemptions are being granted subject to certain conditions, i.e. that no White person may be replaced, that there may not be any mixed working conditions, and that the Whites may not work under the supervision of non-Whites. I know that they will immediately ask me what job reservation implied; it is being said that 3.5 per cent of the people derive benefit from it.</p>

<p>Let us see what was said by one of the greatest leaders of the trade unions, namely Mr. Lucas van den Berg, subsequent to a charge having been made by Tucsa&#x2019;s Director of Economic Research, Mr. R. L. Kraft (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0526"/>Mr. Kraft said yesterday that Tucsa was protecting its 173,000 workers with equal pay for equal work. With job reservation the Confederation can only protect approximately 3.5 per cent of its 150,0 members, he said. Mr. van den Berg said it was impossible for Tucsa to support job reservation&#x2014;or to invoke it &#x2014;since the majority of its members were non-Whites and would not permit it.</block>

<p>Of his 173,000 members more than 100,000 are non-Whites. Therefore, the tail is still wagging the dog. But what does that leader of a responsible trade union, the Confederation of Labour, which represents approximately 200,000 Whites, have to say&#x003F; I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reason for the low figure is that the Confederation of Labour has been troubling the Minister concerned as little as possible. Job reservation is usually written into agreements between trade unions and employers. It is only in extreme cases, where the employer does not want to honour the national policy, that the Confederation invokes ministerial assistance. Consequently all of the 190,0 members are protected by job reservation, be it by ministerial determination or by way of agreement.</block>

<p>That is the guarantee which the worker wants. That is what the worker pleaded for. It is for that reason that the worker is so grateful for the fact that section 77 has been embodied in our Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg City complained that the White worker did not believe their policy because we were distorting their policy. How would they believe their policy&#x003F; He went on to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The White worker is being held back under the policy of the Nationalist Party, but under the U.P. policy he will be able to go ahead.</block>

<p>In terms of their policy the White worker will be pushed by the non-Whites, because the non-White workers will flow in from behind. Now I want to ask this question: What worker can believe the United Party&#x003F; What guarantee can the United Party give the worker that he will not be ousted&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is a possible leader of the United Party. If that hon. member regards the Immorality Act as being the pettiest example of petty apartheid, I want to ask him what his views are on labour integration. No, a thing of that nature is obvious. The White worker cannot rely on that party. A party which wants to remove section 77 from the Industrial Conciliation Act, cannot have the support of the worker. They cannot have that support, for the United Party&#x2019;s Leader has said that they will repeal that section. It is the guarantee of the White worker. It is the protective measure for the Whites in the industry. The National Party will definitely never repeal that section in the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>The struggle against inflation and its control lie in the hands of every citizen in South Africa. They lie in the hands of the worker. All that is being asked, is a little sacrifice&#x2014;not much, just a little. If each of us would only be a little less ease-loving, if each of us would only work a little harder, if we would strip away that snobbery and certain status symbols which we have set for ourselves, it will be much easier to win this fight. Over the years we have set ourselves certain norms. One must necessarily have two motor-cars and a swimming bath, and there was even a time when one had to have one&#x2019;s prostate gland removed in order to have so-called status. What I am saying, is that we should do away with those status symbols which have contributed to inflation. By saving a little more, inflation would disappear like mist before the morning-sun. If the choice lies between survival and growth, the choice is unambiguously survival with controlled growth. It is in that light that the worker of South Africa sees the solution. If we were to accept the United Party&#x2019;s policy of integration, we would have the greatest industrial unrest there could ever be. This party has brought us industrial peace, and I want to give hon. members the assurance that the workers will not allow themselves to be misled by this cheap propaganda which the United Party is trying to hold up to them or by the dissatisfaction which the United Party is trying to create in their ranks. With those tactics they will not get very far.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark was not addressing us this afternoon, but he was addressing the workers on the Witwatersrand who have such mistrust in the actions of this Government. In the no-confidence <span class="col_1027-1028" refersTo="page_0527"/>debate I spoke at length about the chaotic state of affairs in the pelagic fishing industry in South Africa. I referred to the reports of the South-West African commission as well as the three interim reports of the South African commission to support my arguments. The Deputy Minister replied in detail the following day. Today I want to reply to the main points which he made at the time, and I want to go further by discussing the mismanagement of the rock lobster industry in South Africa by the Government. The hon. the Deputy Minister told me that many of the facts on which I had based my conclusions were not correct. I challenge him today to reply in writing and in full to my main allegations. Then we shall thrash out the matter later in this House. Secondly, he stated that I was referring to things which had happened in the Republic before he became associated with the Department of Economic Affairs. He said that consequently it would be wrong for him to attempt to pass judgement on the things which had taken place in the department at that time. What I want to know is who is going to speak about that, because I have made very serious accusations. Is the Minister of Finance going to speak about it, because he was Minister of Economic Affairs for a number of years&#x003F; Are the hon. members for Piketberg, Moorreesburg, Parow and Paarl going to speak about it&#x003F; Are they going to speak specifically about certain of the allegations which I made&#x003F; With all respect, I want to say that it is not necessary for the hon. the Deputy Minister to pass judgment. All we on this side of the House are asking is that he should furnish all the necessary data and information to us and to the people outside. The people outside will pass judgment on that. I actually feel rather sorry for the hon. the Deputy Minister, because I believe him to be an honest man. I believe him to be someone who is interested in protecting our marine life. He has inherited a mess from his predecessors and he does not want to get involved in it. The hon. the Deputy Minister is, however, a member of the Cabinet and consequently he cannot avoid co-responsibility. The hon. the Deputy Minister was also a member of the Executive Committee of South-West Africa and he cannot be exonerated of all blame for what has happened in South-West Africa. He says he has no knowledge of the allegations I made or of what happened in his department. I want to give the hon. the Deputy Minister some advice today. Firstly, he can consult his own Minister of Economic Affairs, because he was a director of a very successful fishing company for some time. Secondly, he can consult his own Minister and ask him to tell him what happened in South Africa in the days of the previous Deputy Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs. Thirdly and lastly, he can ask the hon. the Minister of Finance for information about the sad state in which the fishing industry in South Africa has been over the years. The present Minister of Finance carries a very big responsibility for what is happening in the fishing industry of today.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister also said that I had made use of disgusting information when I asserted that the South-West African Administration had granted fishmeal licences to the Trust Bank at Luderitz and to Volkskas at Walvis Bay. In one respect the hon. the Minister was right and I was wrong, and I want to put the record straight today. Volkskas did not get a fishmeal concession at Walvis Bay. I therefore want to apologize to Volkskas for my allegation. However, Federale Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor got a fishmeal concession at Walvis Bay. The hon. the Deputy Minister asserted that the Trust Bank, Federale Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor only supplied the financial backing for the two fishmeal concessions. What are the facts&#x003F; I am referring to the two fishmeal concessions which were granted, i.e. the one at Walvis Bay and the other at Luderitz. The particulars which I am going to quote now the hon. the Deputy Minister can go and look up for himself in the share registers of the companies concerned. In Walvis Bay the first fishmeal concession was granted to a company by the name of South Kunene, which still had to be formed, an undertaking being given by the company that 40 per cent of the shares would be made available to <i>bona fide</i> South-West Africans. The second concession was granted at Luderitz to a company by the name of Angra Pequena, which still had to be formed, on the understanding that 45 per cent of the shares of that company too would be made available to <i>bona fide</i> residents of South-West Africa. On the basis of these promises the South-West Administration decided that the guaranteed preference to South-West Africans was satisfactory. This was something for which Adv. Niehaus had pleaded in the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa for years. But what actually happened&#x003F; In <span class="col_1029-1030" refersTo="page_0528"/>the case of South Kunene there were two million shares of 50 cents each. One hundred-and-ninety persons, mainly prominent members of the Nationalist Party, members of the House of Assembly, Senators and members of the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa obtained 330,000 of the 755,000 shares offered. 1.2 million shares went to Federale Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor. I now want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister whether this was not in fact a concession to Federale Volksbeleggings and Bonuskor. In the case of Angra Pequena there were 1.8 million shares of 50 cents each. Fifty persons, also prominent members of the Nationalist Party, got 80,000 shares, and 1,209 million shares went to the Trust Bank. The registered address of the Trust Bank is No. 136 Adderley Street, Cape Town. Preference shares were issued as well. Every one of the 400,000 preference shares offered were obtained by Santam. Two years later the share capital of Angra Pequena was increased by 550,000 shares. Every one of these 550,000 shares went to the Trust Bank Nominees (Pty.), Ltd., of the same address in Cape Town, on behalf of the original shareholders of Wesbank Fisheries. Wesbank Fisheries was a company which had obtained a rock lobster concession at Luderitz the previous year. A while ago this concession was withdrawn, for very interesting reasons. I shall come to these reasons shortly.</p>

<p>They relate to the capital increase of the Angra Pequena company. I shall return to this shortly.</p>

<p>I should also like to say something in connection with factory ships now. Firstly, there is the Willem Barendsz.</p>

<p>Do hon. members in this House not remember that the South-West African Administration refused a licence to the owner of the Willem Barendsz in the first instance&#x003F; But according to the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reply the then Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Diederichs, flew to Windhoek and advanced different reasons, which, according to the Deputy Minister, are not relevant in this debate. Why are these reasons not relevant in this debate&#x003F; I should like to ask the Deputy Minister what good reasons the then Minister of Economic Affairs advanced for a licence to be granted to the owner of the Willem Barendsz by South Africa. I now want to ask the Minister of Finance to tell us in this House why he, as Minister of Economic Affairs, had to fly specially to Windhoek in order to put in a word on behalf of the factory-ship owners. Even worse, Sir, shortly afterwards the same Minister of Economic Affairs granted two more factory licences, if my facts are correct. The first one was to the Zuiderkruis and the second to a ship which had not yet been bought at that stage. The Deputy Minister said that the Executive Committee was not happy about that. Then they sent a deputation to Cape Town to consult the brand-new Prime Minister and call in his assistance against the action of his own Minister of Economic Affairs. What was the result&#x003F; Drastic legislation was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of South-West Africa against the factory ships which had been licensed by the Government of South Africa. Secondly, the aid of the Police was called in to protect the territorial waters of South-West Africa against the factory ships. As recently as this year the Minister of Defence offered the assistance of the Navy for taking action against the factory ships in the territorial waters of South-West Africa. I challenge the Minister of Finance, the Father Christmas who granted these concessions, to tell us why he granted three factory-ship licences, with disastrous consequences for the fishing industry in South-West Africa and at enormous cost to the taxpayers of South Africa and South-West Africa.</p>

<p>Lastly I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister something. In replying to my speech he asked, &#x201C;What did the Opposition do&#x003F;&#x201D; He said the Opposition also had a duty in this connection. In his maiden speech in this House more than 20 years ago, the Leader of the Opposition warned against the over-exploitation of the pilchard resources of the West Coast and South-West Africa. For the last five years I got up in this House every year and warned the Government against over-exploitation of the rock lobster industry, and particularly the pilchard resources, in South Africa and South-West Africa. I introduced a private motion in 1967 and called for a commission of inquiry, because over-exploitation was taking place. Have there been no further warnings&#x003F; Just take a look at the Fishcor reports since 1965. Every year there were cautious warnings to the Government that over-exploitation was possibly taking place. What about the 1966 report of the <span class="col_1031-1032" refersTo="page_0529"/>South-West African Commission&#x003F; The report indicated danger signs in the industry. Dr. Lochner submitted warnings and a theory to the commission of inquiry three years ago. Sir, what became of the theory and warnings of Dr. Lochner&#x003F; Were they tested by experts&#x003F; No, Sir. They were referred to a sub-committee of the Fishing Commission. Sir, a sub-committee under the chairmanship of a man who is a director of one of the controlling companies of the Zuiderkruis factory ship! This is not gossip. This is the official reply which the Deputy Minister recently gave me in this House.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Now, Sir, I want to deal specifically with the mismanagement of the rock lobster industry, first of all in South Africa and then in South-West Africa. It is common knowledge in the industry that in 1959, after the industry was consulted, the then Director of Fisheries expressed grave concern at the trend that was developing in the rock lobster industry. Size and composition was falling and unit of effort was rising. Those were obvious danger signs. The industry of its own volition agreed to a cut in quotas. They agreed to a cut of per cent in 1960 and a further cut of per cent per year for the following three years. The result would have been to have reduced the quotas from 365,000 cases of rock lobster tails to 310,0 cases per year, but what happened&#x003F; The Government overrode the advice of the Director of Fisheries and overrode the voluntary abandonment of a portion of their quotas by the rock lobster industry. This is what the Government did: In 1962 it announced that as from 1st January, 1963, the existing quotas of the old established quota holders would be reduced to 290,0 cases, but at the same time 21 brand-new concessions were given, amounting to 45,000 cases, to brand-new concessionaries. In spite of the warning of the scientific advisers of the Government 25,0 cases per annum more than the Director of Fisheries was prepared to authorize were in fact authorized and granted by the Government. One should not forget that in those days the quota system applied only to rock lobster tails for export. There was no limit on the amount of rock lobsters caught for internal use. I think I am correct in saying that the Minister of Finance was at that time Minister of Economic Affairs. At the same time as this concession spree was taking place, 6 further concessions were granted for the export of live rock lobsters, without any quota limitation whatsoever. None of those concessionaries had any connection with the rock lobster industry whatsoever. These lucky people were given right royal treatment. Their production was not limited. Established rock lobster industry was directed to make supplies of live rock lobster available to the lucky six concessionaries for export purposes. Around this time, Natal was not excluded from this spree. Sixty-odd quotas totalling 600,000 20-lb. cases, were granted to concessionaries in Natal. The best year that the Natal rock lobster industry had ever experienced to that date had been 30,000 cases per annum. No resource research whatsoever had been undertaken in Natal and the persons and firms granted these concessions generally speaking had no connection whatsoever with the industry. Today there are no more rock lobsters in Natal.</p>

<p>What were the consequences of the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x003F; Emergency steps, advocated by the fishing Commission last year, have to be taken this year. In terms of these steps, all rock lobsters now have to be brought under a quota system. The overall production quota is 175,000 cases, or 5.5 million pounds weight. Contrast that with the position a year ago before the new system was introduced. At that stage the export quota alone was 6.5 million pounds and there was unlimited local market production, with no quota for the export of live rock lobsters. Now suddenly, because of over-exploitation, emergency steps have to be taken. There have been 7 or 8 years of unlimited exploitation and assault on the rock lobster industry of the west coast. Those long associated with the industry have had their quotas cut in some cases by as much as 70 per cent over a period of 10 years. The people who benefited are the newcomers, the privileged newcomers. They have benefited at the expense of the old concession holders.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, let me deal with the South-West African rock lobster mismanagement. From 1922 to 1963 two large companies fished at Luderitz. There were good years and there were bad years and the average production quota was about 3,800 lbs. per annum. But in 1963 the South-West African Administration awarded the Trust Bank/Angra Pequena fish meal licence, that I have already referred to, at Luderitz. Sir, do you know what they said&#x003F; They said that because the existence of pelagic <span class="col_1033-1034" refersTo="page_0530"/>fish at Luderitz was somewhat doubtful they would give Angra Pequena a rock lobster export quota of 25,000 cases to ensure the profitability of Angra Pequena. In 1964, the next year, the South African Government&#x2014;not South-West Africa &#x2014;awarded a 80,000 case rock lobster tail quota to Wesbank Fisheries; that is the concession to which I referred just now. Sir, listen to this concession: It was subject to certain conditions. The rock lobster were only allowed to be caught in the vicinity of islands off the South-West African coast. There were certain other peculiar features. First of all, the South-West African Administration was never consulted in this matter at all although all the islands in the area off the South-West coast are in the area fished by the Luderitz crayfish industry. Secondly, one island for which this concession was given was even in the middle of a sanctuary proclaimed by the South-West African Administration and where South West registered boats were not allowed to fish for crayfish.</p>

<p>What a scandal!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Not unnaturally people were upset, and I believe a deputation of the S.W.A. Administration came to see the then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd. The whole matter was raised with him and a compromise was arrived at. I would rather be a compromised participant than a shareholder if this is what a compromise is!</p>

<p>The Trust Bank company, Angra Pequena, was awarded a 94,000 case quota, bringing its total rock lobster quota to 1,880,000 lbs. per annum, and Wesbank&#x2019;s quota was withdrawn. One would naturally feel sorry for Wesbank for having its quota withdrawn. But I said earlier that at much the same time Angra Pequena made an issue of shares, and the people who received the shares of Angra Pequena were the people who were the shareholders in Wesbank, whose concession was withdrawn. Sir, the compromise was this: Angra Pequena had been established to exploit a fish meal quota at Luderitz of 90,000 tons where the presence of pelagic fish was doubtful. Instead of that, it received an enormous rock lobster concession. Secondly, the compositions of the boards and the names of the shareholders of Angra Pequena and the Mid-west group are, to say the least of it, very similar. I am told that the controlling interest is the same.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what has been the consequence of the Government&#x2019;s rock lobster policy&#x003F; They permitted crayfish exploitation at Luderitz to be raised by 50 per cent in that one year alone. Sir, one need not plead for those unhappy shareholders from Wesbank. They received a <i>quid pro quo</i> in the special issue by Angra Pequena the next year.</p>

<p>Sir, in this speech I have dealt with the wreckless mismanagement of the South African and South-West African rock lobster industry by the Government. Proof of my allegations is to be found in the fact that the rock lobster report of the Fishing Commission urges emergency measures to be taken, and further proof exists in the fact that the quotas have been slashed. In the no-confidence debate I referred to a crisis in the pelagic fishing industry. As proof that what I said was correct, I want to point out that there has been a slashing of the pelagic fish quotas by this Government in the last few months. The Minister referred to slashed quotas for the factories in South-West Africa of 45,000 tons in his reply to my speech. I understand there has been a further slashing to 30,000 since he made his speech. Sir, the Government is panic-stricken; it does not know what to do with the rock lobster industry and its own mismanagement. It does not know how to handle the pelagic fish industry mess after its own years of mismanagement. The Government alone is responsible for the ten years of unbridled assault on the marine resources off the South African and the South-West African coast by their political pals and their business buddies. Never in the sphere of government over the last 10 years has there been greater mismanagement and greater political nepotism than in the fishing industry.</p>

<p>I do not know precisely what the intention of the hon. member for Simonstown is with this question of fish which he is repeatedly raising.

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from><span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0531"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because I know better than the hon. member to what extent it would affect the economic conditions in South-West Africa in particular if the industry there were to fail. But the one thing in regard to which the hon. member must understand me clearly now &#x2014;and perhaps I did not make it very clear on the previous occasion when we discussed this matter&#x2014;is that I am only prepared to accept responsibility and to answer for decisions in South-West Africa in which I was involved, and I am prepared to answer for decisions here in the Republic in which I was involved in my capacity as Deputy Minister. [Interjections.] Hon. members are not going to budge me one inch as far as this is concerned. I am not prepared to go snooping about into the past of whatever it is that happened. That is not my task. My task is to view the situation as it is today, and to try to do my best. It is not my task to snoop into what was done in the past. I indicated to the hon. member in the previous debate why it would even be foolish to try to go snooping about in this way, because it is never possible for one to get the same set of facts before one, when you begin snooping into the matter a year or five years later, as that man had before him at that time. In other words, you may then be lending yourself to arriving at conclusions which may be totally incorrect because you do not have that same set of facts before you as the man previously had before him. Therefore I am not going back into that past history. I do not regard myself as being equal to it. I am not going to do that snooping about. It is not my task.</p>

<p>The hon. member began by saying that he would be glad if I could furnish him with a full written reply to his main points. I replied to those main points to the best of my ability during the no-confidence debate. I did not reply to the points which I regarded as being of lesser importance. But the hon. member is at liberty, if he wants more information from me than I was able to give, to raise this matter with me, whether in writing or orally, and we can discuss this matter or we can conduct a correspondence in regard to it. But there is nothing as far as I am concerned which I am trying to keep quiet.</p>

<p>In addition the hon. member also said &#x2014;I think these are the few points which he raised and which I feel I ought to reply to&#x2014;that I had alleged in my speech during the no-confidence debate that the F.V.B. and the Trust Bank had only acted as guarantors, in this connection. I think the hon. member must read my speech again, because I did not allege that and that was not the position. I made it very clear that day that the Executive Committee had mentioned a few points which it would take into account in the consideration of applications. One of the points which was mooted in that debate, was that the Executive Committee would look for strong financial resources in the undertaking to whom the concession was made. [Interjections.] The financial resources of the company or group of companies to whom the concession was being made would be taken into consideration. There was never any mention of surety. The Executive Committee wanted to be certain&#x2014;and I have advanced the reason for this&#x2014;that if we were caught by trade boycotts, which at that time seemed very real, such a company would have resources other than its share capital which it could fall back on if it became necessary for it to do so. Those are the financial resources which the Executive Committee was looking for.</p>

<p>I indicated very clearly how a group of persons in Luderitz&#x2014;and I even mentioned why the Executive Committee were sympathetic towards them&#x2014;liaised with the Trust Bank in order to look for that strong capital backing. They submitted a joint application. They did it as a group. That is as the position was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wiley">

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. The same applies to the application of a group of persons from Windhoek who liaised with Federale Volksbeleggings. I said the other day that I assumed it was with Federale Volksbeleggings, but was not quite certain. The hon. member also mentioned Bonuscor. That is possible.</p>

<p>One of the other points laid down by the Executive Committee which they would take into account was how much of the share capital the group which was making application would be prepared to allocate to <i>bona fide</i> inhabitants of South-West Africa. That was the other point. This was not relevant the other day, and I did not mention it. Those applications were made. I do not know any more now how many there were. There were 20 or so, or perhaps even more. The applications were made by <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0532"/>various people who had formed themselves into groups, taking into account those four, five or six points which the Executive Committee had said in advance they would take into account. I shall try to satisfy the hon. member since this whole matter apparently has a fishy smell about it to him. The Executive Committee gave that pile of applications to a committee of officials and said: Look, sort out these applications in order of merit according to your judgment, taking into account those points which the Executive Committee indicated it would pay special attention to. That group of officials sorted out the applications in order of merit. The Executive Committee was satisfied with the officials&#x2019; first and second choice. It was consequently accepted thus. Without any further ado the concessions were allocated to these two groups, which the officials had indicated as being their first and second choice.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about members of the Legislative Assembly and the subdivision of shares. Why should a member of the Legislative Assembly not have applied for shares&#x003F; Why should a member of the House of Assembly not have applied for shares&#x003F; It was not these people who decided on those concessions. The body that decided on the concessions was the Executive Committee. Neither the Executive Committee nor individual members of the Executive Committee applied for shares. Of that I am absolutely certain, in so far as I can answer for this situation. They did not apply for shares. That is the whole story. I hope the hon. member will now be convinced that although this matter concerns fish, this matter, has figuratively speaking, no fishy smell about it. I feel absolutely convinced about that.</p>

<p>The hon. member is putting pressure on me in regard to the Willem Barendsz and the reasons which I said were not relevant. As far as I am concerned, the Opposition can put as much pressure on me as they like, but I am not going any further than to say that those considerations satisfied the Executive Committee that it would co-operate in the case of the Willem Barendsz under those conditions. Those considerations, which were mentioned by the then Minister of Economic Affairs, were confided to the Executive Committee. With that this matter, as far as I am concerned, is closed, no matter how much the Opposition wants to discuss it. The fact of the matter is that the Executive Committee was satisfied, seen from the point of view of South-West Africa, that it would fish under those conditions.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member came to Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory.</p>

<p>This I said in the previous debate. I said that, a few days after the concession became known, I visited the Prime Minister here in the Cape, and I told him the whole story. There is absolutely nothing I can add to what I have said. I told the hon. member candidly that the Executive Committee did not feel happy about those concessions. What more does he want in this regard&#x003F; In regard to Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, I have already explained to the hon. member that it does not help to submit Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory to scientists if an agreement cannot be reached with him in regard to those scientists. I said in the previous debate that my information was that the Department cannot reach an agreement with Dr. Lochner in regard to the scientists to whom it could he submitted for consideration. After all one would want, if that committee of scientists were to reject the theory, Dr. Lochner to accept that rejection. If he is not satisfied with the Committee which is appointed in this way, then one is really achieving nothing and then the same situation as we now have simply continues. I said that I myself should very much like to have absolute clarity in regard to Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory, because once we know that that theory is correct and can be accepted, then it is not only a very important scientific breakthrough for South Africa, but, then we have something into which we can really get our teeth, and on the basis of which we can plan for the future. At the moment it is very difficult. One cannot merely say: Cut down as Dr. Lochner says should be done. For example, if we think of Walvis Bay &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I stated emphatically that my information from the Department was that an agreement could not be reached with Dr. Lochner in regard to the scientists who should test his theory. Mr. Speaker, I maintain that one cannot simply cut down. The position with the Walvis Bay industry is that it has a quota of 30,000 tons of pilchards&#x2014;I think I mentioned in a previous debate that the quota had been reduced to 30,000 tons&#x2014;and perhaps a further quota for 30,000 anchovies, which is uncertain. This means that the fishing industry at Walvis Bay will be cut down by at least one-third. This affects not only the industry; it affects not only the fishermen. It also affects the local authority there, as far as its financial revenue is concerned, and it affects the entire community of Walvis Bay, as far as its normal activities are concerned. In other words, one must be very careful how one cuts down. One must consider both points of view. One must try to keep an economy going, and one must try to restore an industry. One cannot merely take decisions lightly in this regard. We cannot merely decide that Dr. Lochner&#x2019;s theory must be accepted, for we do not know whether it is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member also referred to the concessions of crayfish licences to Angra Pequena and specifically to the allocation which was made at the time to a certain group of companies, the name of which I cannot remember any more, to catch crayfish in the vicinity of the islands off-shore from Luderitz, which is Republican territory. This does not belong to South-West Africa. Before that concession was made, the concession was made to Angra Pequena, to which the hon. member referred, for very good reasons. When that concession for pelagic fish was made&#x2014;let us sort this matter out candidly now&#x2014;the Executive Committee had the recommendation of the Fisheries Division there. After an investigation had been launched by the applicants, they eventually obtained a concession. A further investigation was instituted by our Sea Fisheries Division&#x2014;this is on record&#x2014;which came to the conclusion that the allocation of a further pelagic fish factory there was possible. The Executive Committee had reservations in this regard. At that time the Executive Committee did not have reason to believe that crayfish was being over-exploited. There were signs of that, but then there were improvements again. There was proper control. The Executive Committee felt that it would have disastrous consequences for the little town of Luderitz if a licence were granted, the development were to take place there and the licence were withdrawn again. Hon. members who know Luderitz will understand the whole position. The community adjusts to such activities and it would have had disastrous consequences if those activities had been terminated. Consequently, to obtain more stability, the Executive Committee decided to grant Luderitz a crayfish quota as well, a smaller crayfish quota than the normal quotas. This would be something to keep it going. This is how it worked out, and there were no problems. Then the concession was made in the Republican waters off-shore of Luderitz. These are grounds where South-West Africa have been catching crayfish for the last 20 years. It is true that part of that concession comprised a conservation area. The result was that the Executive Committee of South-West Africa came to Cape Town to discuss the matter with the then Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>Yes, it helped. We discussed the matter with the then Deputy Minister and the upshot of that discussion was that he was unable to cancel the concessions. But we agreed on an amalgamation between the two concessions, with a considerable reduction of the joint crayfish quota added to that. That is what we were able to achieve, and that is what was achieved. Afterwards some concern was felt, and the indication today is that over-exploitation of crayfish is taking place. Corrective measures are being taken in this regard.</p>

<p>I think that is as far as I was able to take notes while the hon. member was speaking. I think I have replied to the points raised by him. I now want to say to the hon. member in conclusion that I have had a lot to do with fish in my lifetime, and the hon. member is also interested in the same thing. I have learned that if one has anything to do with fish, you must be very careful of the smell which is usually to be found in the vicinity of fish. The hon. member can bear that in mind as well.</p>

<p>Of course. We on the Opposition side cannot let the matter rest here. Here we have to do with the second largest industry in South-West Africa. Next to the mining industry it is the largest industry in South-West Africa, and it is one of the most important industries of the Republic of South Africa. And as such it was regarded by the United Party Government which preceded this one when they came forward with the Fisheries Development Corporation and the legislation regulating these matters. However, this Government came into power and today there is nothing but chaos in this industry. Practically nothing remains of the industry, and now the responsible Deputy Minister says he is not interested in what happened.</p>

<p>Yes, he does not want to ferret around. But the people have the right to know what is becoming of their assets. The people have the right to know why the Government is squandering their assets. We, as the representatives of the people, cannot accept this flippant and happy-go-lucky attitude of the Minister. He will hear more about this.</p>

<p>It is something which is causing one concern in South Africa today, this tendency one finds in the Government to refuse to accept responsibility for its actions. The same goes for the Government in general. It also goes for the hon. the Minister of Finance. Among the people there is a growing protest against the mismanagement of this Government, a growing protest against the policy of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his actions as they affect the ordinary man in South Africa. The Government shrugs its shoulders and tries to blame the outside world. Furthermore it tries to blame the ordinary man for being too extravagant, meanwhile proceeding recklessly on its course of penalizing the man who can least afford it for the evil consequences of the Government&#x2019;s own actions and its own policy. Therefore we on this side of the House are protesting against this Government&#x2019;s failure and against the Government&#x2019;s neglecting to protect the interests of the citizens of South Africa.</p>

<p>Their sins are legion. The most striking of the sins of this Government is their inability to combat inflation and the way in which they first promote inflation and immediately afterwards come forward with attempts in the form of penalizing the ordinary citizen in order to combat the way in which they themselves have promoted it. Equally striking is the way in which they grant voters large salary increases before general elections and even by-elections, and then, when the election is over, blame those same people and say that they are extravagant. Then they are called irresponsible because they spend their increased salaries on things which they believe they need. Then the Government again has to introduce punitive measures to take that money away from them and to curtail the spending of the increases which they themselves granted. On account of its own debt the Government is today applying punitive measures to curtail the income and the spending power of the people, without considering the persons who are being punished. In these proposals for new sales tax increases the people who earn least, pensioners, the people with small regular incomes and those who have to turn over every cent before spending it, are taxed in the same way and on the same scale as the richest in our country. No discretion is applied. Neither the hon. the Minister nor any other hon. member on that side has yet replied to the assertion made by this side of the House that it is not the less well-to-do who are extravagant. However, these people are taxed as if they are the ones who are extravagant. When the hon. the Minister replies to this debate, I hope he will give us a <span class="col_1043-1044" refersTo="page_0535"/>guarantee that the money which is being taken away and will probably be taken away by means of further taxes on 31st March, will not be spent by the Government in a way which will promote inflation. We all know how Government expenditure has increased. When there have been inflationary tendencies in the country, Government expenditure in the public sector has on occasion increased even more rapidly, proportionally, than that of the private sector. We want the Government to guarantee that, if it wants to reduce the people&#x2019;s buying power, it will restrain itself as well.</p>

<p>While the hon. the Minister of Planning is present, I just want to say in passing that we as members of the House of Assembly take it amiss of him that we had to read a very important report on the economic development programme up to 1975 in the newspapers this morning, while it was not yet available to members of this House and is still not available. We take it amiss of him that he stated outside what the Government&#x2019;s reaction is to this important report dealing with matters we are at present discussing, while the report is not yet available to members of this House. One gains the impression that the Government is quite indifferent to the public of South Africa. One gains the impression that the Government feels it is appointed by a higher authority and is not elected by the people and does not have to account to their representatives. One gets the feeling that the Government is high-handed, presumptuous, arrogant, unsympathetic &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall tell you now. I am thinking of taxes, for instance. There was a time under this Government, when it was more responsible than under its present leadership, when the people knew that when they were going to be taxed, they would be taxed in this Parliament in a Budget which could be discussed as such. However, as the Government now realizes that the burdens it is imposing on the people are so heavy and will have such a tremendous impact if they are imposed all at once, it is trying to spread them over the year. The United Party Government and the Nationalist Party Government that preceded it always announced increases in postal rates in the Budget. Now these increases, ranging from R20 million to R30 million, are usually announced when Parliament is not in session. They cannot be announced at the time of the Budget, because then they would have too great an impact on the people. The people would realize what was being done to them. Now, for the first time, a tax of R47 million has to be announced in the Part Appropriation, a month before the main Budget, so that the main Budget will appear a little more favourable. After all, R47 million less will now be announced in the main Budget. This is a clever way to approach the people. Why cannot the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs come to Parliament when he wants to put up his rates&#x003F; The hon. the Minister of Transport usually does. The hon. Minister of Finance has always done so too, but even he now wants the right to increase taxes during the recess in a stealthy and underhand manner, so that when the Budget is introduced the people will not realize what is happening under this Government. And it is pitiful that a Government should govern so badly that it has to devise all sorts of schemes to try to evade its responsibility towards Parliament and towards the representatives of the people. Even the way in which they charge the system of taxation is aimed at concealing from the people what they are doing to them. Do hon. members know that during the election I came across the rumour in the Free State that the sales tax had been introduced in order that income tax might be totally abolished by this Government&#x003F; I am not saying that the Government was responsible for it, but these are the stories which were spread by Nationalists among the public of South Africa. Still, the fact remains that the sales tax was introduced with certain sound objectives and that income tax was reduced. Income tax is something you know you are paying. You feel it when you pay it. It hurts when you pay it. But you are not aware of the sales tax. Furthermore, the Government does not make known to the people what they are paying as a result of the sales tax. It merely announces the percentage which the Government takes of the factory price or the import price. But the <span class="col_1045-1046" refersTo="page_0536"/>people do not realize what they are paying. The middleman and eventually the retailer at the point of consumption all make a profit on the sales tax which is levied at source in South Africa. One cannot blame the businessmen. They invest the money. They pay it to the Government immediately and they are entitled to a profit, but the public does not know it. The public may think it is paying 20 per cent or 30 per cent on an article, while in fact it is paying 40, 50 or perhaps 60 per cent on the original price of that article.</p>

Now I want to ask him: Would he support me if I were now to ask the Minister of Finance in the interests of the public to adopt the course being followed in Germany, England and America, where these taxes are in operation&#x003F; There, if a man is given an invoice for anything he buys in the retail trade, the price of the product and the tax paid on it are indicated separately on that invoice. I am almost sure the hon. member for Brakpan is going to support me.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>There we are! I highly appreciate it. It must be a very good standpoint. It is a valid standpoint, because one of the more intelligent members of the Nationalist Party immediately agrees with me. Is it fair towards the public that they have to blame the retailer, as the hon. member there has done, for the fact that the Government does not have the manpower to do with this tax what it ought to do, i.e. to levy it at the point of final consumption&#x003F; Because they do not have the manpower, because they have only 1,300 points to deal with when they do it at source, they do not want to levy the tax at the retail point so that the people may only pay what they have to pay. Therefore I shall be very glad to learn from the hon. the Minister whether he will in future make provision for the public being informed, by means of invoices or labels, as the member for Durban Point suggests, of how much it pays towards the normal price of the product and how much towards tax and profit on tax. I think this is the least to which the public is entitled. It is done in most countries which apply this form of taxation.</p>

<p>If the Government does not do this, it is because it does not have the courage to let the people know what it is taking out of their pockets. It conceals what it is doing to the people of South Africa. I doubt whether the Minister will say &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. It is a simple matter. The Government has made one thing clear&#x2014;it has no mercy at all for the ordinary man in South Africa. The Government is itself responsible for extraordinary expenditure in South Africa. On a previous occasion my hon. Leader gave a whole list of the things on which they are spending money unnecessarily. In 1938 I reported on Mr. Havenga&#x2019;s Budget from the Press gallery. Then he asked R80 million on the ordinary Revenue Account for governing South Africa. After the war, in 1948, the United Party Government asked for about R260 million to govern South Africa. And now, Sir, what will this Minister ask this year&#x003F; It will not be calculable in tens of millions or hundreds of millions. It will be thousands of millions. We know it. How much of it is necessary&#x003F; How much of it is spent on ideological things&#x003F; As my hon. Leader said, that money will be required because we have a Government which is itself a luxury and an extravagance in South Africa under present circumstances. Just consider what the laxity and delays of the Government are costing South Africa. Just consider the fact that the Orange River Scheme might have been completed long ago, at the prices of 10 or 15 years ago. How much more is that scheme not costing us now, because for 16 years the Government talked nonsense about its being an impossible scheme and an extravagant United Party plan&#x003F; Just think of the citizens on the banks of the Orange River in the Eastern Cape who are dead and who, had this Government not been in power, would have lived and enjoyed the benefits of that Orange River scheme.</p>

<p>We were planning it.

[Interjections.] Sir, just look at the extravagance and the foolishness of the Government. How they ridiculed Mr. Sturrock for wanting to have the Railways build hotels in South Africa! Who is now building the hotels&#x003F; Now it is costing three or four times as much as it would have cost if they had built those hotels 22 years ago. If they had only had the foresight to know that 22 years ago Mr. Sturrock was seeing farther than they can see now. These are facts, Sir. One cannot forgive the Government for this. In particular one cannot forgive the Government for trying to hide what it is doing to the people. One wonders: Is the Government doing the obvious thing to end this unfortunate state of inflation&#x003F; I do not want to discuss the labour policy again at this juncture. We have done so already and we shall do so again, but is it not strange that the Government members now respond to the sound proposals made by the United Party in regard to labour with a story which is untrue&#x003F; They say that in terms of our policy we want to flood the urban areas with Native labour.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there you have it again. We ask for two things. In the first place we ask for the existing labour to be better utilized. We are supported by experts all over when we say that there are few countries in the world where labour is used as lavishly and applied as uneconomically as in South Africa. However, that aspect of the matter is being concealed. In the second place we ask for industries not to be forced to decentralize today merely for ideological reasons, which are often uneconomical. We realize that decentralization may be necessary for economic and sociological considerations, but they should not be forced to decentralize merely for ideological reasons. We cannot understand why the Government wants to multiply the administration of urban and industrial areas at this juncture, when there is a shortage of manpower. At 10 of 12 new places they now want to appoint new administrative officials, new Native officials and new labour officials, and establish new authorities, while these things could be done much more thoroughly and effectively in the existing areas until such time as the inflationary pressure has disappeared.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Then, Sir, in the few minutes left to me I want to deal more specifically with one aspect of inflation. I want to suggest to the Minister in all seriousness that he can act immediately to limit the incidence of inflation in South Africa. A few days ago I asked the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs about phase III of the local content programme for passenger motor vehicles in South Africa, and I was told that it would require by 1976 a total investment of R110 million by the manufacturers of cars and R50 million by the manufacturers of components in the new manufacturing processes to meet phase III of the local content programme. It is a matter of pride to us all that South Africa should produce her own motor cars, if possible; it would be a prestige achievement for South Africa; but it is also a question of timing, Sir. If it was necessary for urgent strategic considerations one would think differently; but we have seen that strategic considerations are not important in this context. Is it right, Sir, at a time when we are short of labour, when we are short of the skilled labour, which would be required in this third phase of the local content programme more than in the first and second phases, to embark upon this programme, to invest another R160 million which is not urgently necessary and to make greater demands on our labour force and generally to increase the price of a very important product such as a motor vehicle&#x003F; I want to say at once that I cannot think of a section of our community which is more heavily taxed than the motorists. Sir, I do not have the time to go into it now but we have shown before that the taxation on the South African motorist is completely disproportionate to the tax on the rest of the community. I have managed with some difficulty to get hold of figures to show how the gap in the price of the passenger motor vehicle in the country of origin compared with the price of a similar vehicle in South Africa is growing. I must admit that these figures which I give for the country of origin do not include the purchase tax there. [Interjections.] No, it is not important because in Germany, for example, the purchase tax is only 11 per cent.</p>

<p>I have not been able to allow for the fact that a tax rebate is one of the important incentives given to the South African manufacturer for increasing the local content; so there the price of the South African vehicle is disguised. This is what happens. The ordinary Volkswagen in Germany in 1962 cost R868; it now costs R1,075. In 1962 in South Africa it cost R1,315 and it now costs R1,876. The difference has increased from R447 or 51 per cent, in 1962 to R801 or 74.5 per cent in 1971&#x2014;I repeat an increase in the price difference from 51 per cent to 74.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Of course, Sir, in Western Germany labour costs have not gone up and they are not experiencing inflation in Western Germany as well! Sir, they are experiencing inflation in Germany to an unprecedented extent. The hon. member is always very helpful to me but he must study his brief. Sir, take the Olympia Rekord. The Olympia Rekord cost R1,368 in Germany in 1962 and in South Africa R1,783. The difference in price was R415 or 30.3 per cent. Now it costs R2 643 in South Africa and in Germany R1,594, a difference of R1,049 or 65.8 per cent between the price in Germany and that in South Africa. With regard to the Mercedes Benz in the lower price range the difference was R973 in 1962; it is now almost double, i.e. R1,784. The difference was 53.4 per cent in 1962 and it is now 73.1 per cent. These are inescapable facts. I have similar figures for the Fiat and the Volvo and other cars. That is what is happening. [Interjections.] No, I do not have the figures for the ministerial Cadillacs. Sir, I want to ask the hon. the Minister, if he is serious about combating inflation and if, for ideological reasons, he cannot accept any of the other sound and necessary remedies proposed by the United Party, whether he cannot then do what has been suggested as possible by some of his officials and that is to postpone the next stage for a year or two until we have arrested the decrease in the value of our money, until we have checked the present inflation. I think the Minister should make a statement as soon as possible. This is as urgent as the higher tax on purchases which he applied in his Part Appropriation. He can in his reply to the Part Appropriation announce a postponement of Phase 3 of the local content programme in order to avoid the inflationary effects of this programme, because it is inflationary. I have given the prices. It is inflationary because it competes for labour which we have not got, and it is inflationary because it affects the cost of transport. Here we have a Government which is failing the cities of South Africa by not enabling them to deal with their transport problems and by making the ordinary motorist more dependent on private transport to get to and from his work. They are pushing up the price of transport for every citizen in South Africa. If I had time I could tell you, Sir, how some of these duties to protect the local content of motor-cars are levied in South Africa. I could tell you there was a duty for five months on the axles of heavy duty vehicles which increased the price of a double axle heavy vehicle by R450. This was applied for five months and even today the company concerned cannot supply an axle and it is doubtful whether even with a protection of 30 per cent they can do it more cheaply than the imported article. I can tell you about diesel engines. [Laughter.] No, not those, Sir. Diesel engines are becoming a saga in the history of the Nationalist Party. I can tell you about propeller shafts, where because of protective duties, the South African manufacturer has to pay more for the propeller shaft. He is willing to buy the South African product and has accepted the price of the South African product, but months and months and years have gone by without shafts being delivered, in spite of this levy to protect the South African article.</p>

<p>But I do not want to go into details. This is wrong, and it is wrong that it should happen at a time when everybody is warning us against the dreadful consequences of inflation. This is inflationary; it can be postponed and it should be postponed. It can harm nobody and can only benefit South Africa. There are so many other things I can mention, but my time has unfortunately expired. I cannot speak about the immediate effect of this on foreign exchange, where we have problems too. I cannot deal with the fact that commercial vehicles, even light delivery vans, are exempted from this programme, with the result that today you have an interchangeability of parts between vehicles, one of which can be freely imported and the other which is prohibited by heavy taxation and <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0539"/>for other reasons. Sir, I can also tell you about the danger of the limitation of models. I can warn you about what has happened in South America, where in one country for example they have not been able to change the models of their vehicles for many years. They are all driving obsolete cars. There is no incentive to buy, as in Russia, although the country concerned is not a communist state, and a motorcar there costs exactly four times as much as a more modern and efficient vehicle costs in the country of origin. There are dangers attached to this and I would say that in view of the inflationary danger we face, and because this programme must be inflationary, this should be postponed for a year or two. Let us give ourselves a chance to adapt to the new circumstances. Let us help the motor industry to comply efficiently with the 52 per cent local content which more than 40 models have achieved already, and let us give South Africa a break.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville leaves me speechless. The tunnel through the mountains should have been built years ago. He said the timing was wrong. Now that we have reached the third phase of motor vehicle development, he again says the timing was wrong. The hon. member for Yeoville must excuse me for not being able to spend much time on him. I just want to say that what the hon. member had to say in respect of the motor manufacturing industry here is something which we should very much like to discuss with him on some other occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that if there is any person in this House who is competent to discuss this matter&#x2014;and I am saying this without being immodest&#x2014;it would probably be me. Hon. members on the opposite side may as well accept that what the hon. member had to say here this afternoon was absolute nonsense. Hon. members opposite acted in a petty manner in regard to the anti-inflationary measures which the hon. the Minister has now announced&#x2014;I cannot find any other words to describe it. For that reason we want to avail ourselves of this opportunity of dealing with this whole matter and the problems with which we are faced today to the best of our ability in the hope that hon. members on that side of the House will see the light.</p>

<p>It is in the national interest that private consumer spending should be restricted. Over the past two years there have been clear signs of wasteful spending which in the long run can only have a disrupting effect on our economic growth. In the years 1964 to 1968 private consumption grew at an annual rate of approximately 8 per cent. But in the year 1969-&#x2019;70 this growth increased by 2 per cent to 11 per cent. The most important reason for this was the sharp increase in spending on durable consumer goods. This comprises plus-minus 15 per cent of total consumer spending. During the years 1948-&#x2019;68 consumer spending increased by plus-minus 9 per cent per year. In the year 1969-&#x2019;70, however, we find the alarming phenomenon that over those two years there was a growth of 33 per cent, that is an annual increase of 16&#x00BD; per cent. In other words, it is equal to twice the normal growth rate in the early sixties. It must be borne in mind that consumer spending is also the most important component of our gross domestic spending. It represents approximately 60 per cent of the total spending. It is this rapid increase which has been primarily responsible for the short-term overspending problem and all the accompanying woes of balance of payments problems, inflation, capital, labour scarcity, etc.</p>

<p>Over and above this overspending problem the increased rate of consumer spending has curbed savings. This is a very important factor. Not everything was caused by increased incomes. Savings from personal incomes, calculated as a percentage, decreased from 11 per cent in 1964-&#x2019;68 to 6 per cent in 1970. This decreased in personal savings resulted in a shortage of investment capital which in its turn, in the long term, was responsible for the higher interest rates with which we have been faced. It is true that the restrictive measures which have now been adopted in respect of stricter hire-purchase conditions, increased and expanded sales duty, have a discriminatory effect in this sense that it will affect certain sections of society more than others. It is true, and we do not hesitate to say this, that it sometimes happens that certain sections of the public are also harder hit than others. Sometimes those, whom we would not like to see this happen to, are hit hard. We are referring specifically now to the third phase of our local content development in the motor industry. We want to endorse here that in the third phase of this development with <span class="col_1053-1054" refersTo="page_0540"/>its higher costs, which we are now entering, will be accompanied by certain problems. But what we want to add, and bring to the attention of the hon. member for Yeoville is that no curbs can be unaccompanied by sacrifices. There is no painless solution for wasteful spending. We must now have the courage, although this will sometimes be painful, not to hesitate at this stage to do these things, so that we may reach a solution sooner.</p>

<p>Such measures should not be judged in terms of the interest of this or that section but should in the very first place be viewed from the standpoint of the national interest. That is why I say that it is in the national interest that these steps be taken, although certain groups will be hit hard by them. This is only the first of a number of steps which will be taken to remedy the general problem of overspending. It is not only private spending which will be affected in this way. The hon. member for Yeoville, quite rightly, also referred to the fact that Government spending will also have to be carefully scrutinized. We know that everyone will have to tighten their belts a little. I am predicting now that it will once again be the hon. member for Yeoville who will kick up a great fuss when these curbs are introduced, that too little is being spent here and too little is being spent there. I just hope that the hon. member will remember this when such curbs are introduced.</p>

<p>If these steps are not taken the end result of the matter will be ever increasing inflation with sharp rises in the cost of living in the years which lie ahead. Now we have a non-recurrent increase in the prices of consumer goods with the prospect of general prices becoming stabilized in the near future. If we can suggest anything to encourage saving, then we want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it will not be possible to make it more attractive for people to save. If it is possible it would be appreciated if the amount in regard to tax-free investments could be increased. We just want to suggest for consideration the idea that we think that serious consideration will also have to be given to making interest earned on our savings free of tax as well, and to increase the amounts which can be invested free of tax.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon the hon. member for Newton Park introduced a motion in this House in regard to the depopulation of the rural areas and the concomitant problems. I am a person who represents a rural constituency. In the 1969 little Budget the introducer of the amendment referred specifically to two problems here, namely the problems of the old-age pensioners and the problems of the agriculturalists or farmers. But with the collapse of the wool market in this year, 1971, and taking into consideration the fact that the drought has continued unabated during these two years and is still prevailing, the position of the farmers has become infinitely more difficult than in 1969. In the introductory remarks of the Prime Minister in his no-confidence debate he also referred to this as being a serious matter as far as the Government was concerned. That reassuring statement meant a lot to us. The hon. member for Newton Park and the agricultural men on his side are not so concerned about the farmers. Why should he be concerned&#x003F; After all, he represents Port Elizabeth. But in 1969 it was important to them, because it was just before an election and what they did was simply an attempt to catch votes. Now, with this motion which he introduced this afternoon, the hon. member must excuse me if I say that he made a speech which was completely unscientific and completely inept, but which was very popular with a small group of people who find themselves in difficult circumstances. That is why we begin this afternoon by saying to the hon. member that there is a large group of us on this side of the House who have over the years been continually engrossed with the problem of the depopulation of the rural areas, but only on a totally different basis. We begin with the first premise which the hon. member for Fauresmith stated so clearly yesterday, viz. that in any developed country we have the phenomenon of a migration of the rural population to the metropolitan areas. This is a worldwide phenomenon.</p>

<p>Further to the statement by the hon. member for Fauresmith, I just want to mention two figures in this regard to the hon. member for Newton Park. In the entire Western Europe there was, between 1955 and 1965, a movement of 25 per cent of the farmers away from the rural areas to the metropolitan areas. In the 20 years between 1949 and 1969 there was in America a decrease of 6 million to 3 million in the farming population. South Africa has now become a developing country, and why should the position here be any different&#x003F; In other words, what we cannot change, we must accept. Against that back <span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0541"/>ground we must do the best we are able to do. That part of the world where I was born, grew up in and still live, is perhaps the most rural part of the Orange Free State and the north-eastern Cape. I can just mention in passing that the Orange River is no longer a boundary for that region. It is no longer a separating factor; it has now become a unifying factor. That is why we must realize that we will have to tackle this problem in a scientific way. In this way, for example, we have established regional development associations there.</p>

<p>Merely to talk at random, as the hon. member for Newton Park did, means nothing. No, we called in the assistance of a university. The University of the Orange Free State, with the assistance of this Government, firstly from the Natural Resources Development Council and subsequently from the Department of Planning, have made a socio-economic survey of that region, that is, the south-western Free State, and after that of the north-eastern Cape. Now we have in our possession eight bulky reports in respect of every facet of that which occupies our time in that part of the world. From that, certain matters became very clear to us. The hon. member for Fauresmith yesterday gave hon. members an idea of the difference between a scientific approach and an approach based on popular opinion. In the first place we realized that since we lie in the catchment area of the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, further steps would have to be taken to ensure the future of that water scheme. So we set to work in a scientific way and with the knowledge at our disposal persuaded the University of Pretoria to make a survey of something which had for the first time in the history of South Africa happened on such a scale, to an extent for which we are deeply grateful today.</p>

<p>Because we had the scientific knowledge, and I should like to tell the hon. member for Newton Park this, we were able to persuade the former hon. the Minister of Agriculture, the hon. member for Oudtshoorn, to make available to us that main catchment area conservation unit at Aliwal North. From there we went further. We realized that we could do nothing through boasting and in this way we established, with the knowledge at our disposal, a development corporation on which, <i>inter alia,</i> the hon. member for Aliwal North and I serve as directors. The directors of that development corporation are leading figures in every walk of life. To mention only a few, there are four or five professors on the board of managers who are connected with faculties the activities of which have a direct bearing on the problems there. The corporation was established and we are now coping with this problem of depopulation in a planned manner.</p>

<p>I can inform the hort. members that the first task we tackled was the consolidation of farming units. This will have a salutory effect on the soil and will increase production, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our second ideal and task with which we have already achieved a measure of success is the creation of avenues of employment for our people within that region, and this does not necessarily apply only to the agricultural sector. We also have a third ideal, however, and we are already working on this. Thank goodness there were people who had been working on this problem for a long time prior to that. We must offer the people in that region every opportunity to receive proper training so that, if they are required to leave that part of the world, they can hold their own in the developing parts of our fatherland.</p>

<p>To conclude, I want to avail myself of this opportunity this afternoon to break a lance in respect of this matter for that part of the world from which I hail, i.e. the south-eastern Free State. I want to do so because it is imperative that our people should occasionally give attention to this matter. Those depopulating areas do not find it so easy to have industries established there. I almost want to say that it is impossible to situate industries there, to see chimneys arising there. The result is that we in the manufacturing industry can do very little, the exception being the few light agricultural industries. In other words, we are not a region which can export consumer goods, as are obtained in other complexes, but these rural areas have an export product. These are the people whom this area has produced and who have received their training there. There sits another one, namely the hon. member for Hillbrow, who comes from Fauresmith. In that way those regions to which I have referred have had to produce people for both this and that side of the House. I am thinking of Dr. Frans Cronj&#x00E9; who also comes from that part of the world. This afternoon, when the hon. member for Houghton was kicking up such a fuss, I thought again of the old Free State because she was pleading <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0542"/>for Abram Fischer and he is also a son of that part of the world. We must produce people for the whole of South Africa. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister of National Education is also present. We have the strange phenomenon in South Africa that we have enormous schools in our metropolitan areas. Most of them are good schools, but they are overcrowded. I do not doubt that they have the best teachers, both male and female, in South Africa at their disposal. In our rural areas, and I am sneaking in particular now of the south-eastern Free State but this also applies to other towns, there are some of the best school buildings. And these schools are staffed by some of the best teachers both male and female one can find. There are some of the best hostels and hostel facilities, which are second to none. The only difference is that the boarding fees at these hostels are ridiculously low. At these schools there are teachers, both male and female, with the best qualifications. On the one hand, however, we are concerned about the fact that the good German teacher, for example, must hold classes for three pupils, and that an excellent mathematics teacher, for example, must hold classes for five or six pupils. On the other hand, we are grateful for that because those teachers have the whole day in which to give each one of those pupils separate attention. In this way those schools are succeeding, as in my own town, in accomplishing things for which the larger schools do not afford opportunities. In the school at Rouxville there were, for example, 11 matriculants. All 11 passed, six of them with a first class with six distinctions in their subjects. The same applies to all the other schools. We in the rural areas would still like to inform parents, particularly in the metropolitan areas of the Transvaal, that the infrastructure there is perfect. The south-eastern Free State can very easily be reached by means of a fine tarred road or convenient railway services. By means of these fine educational facilities and hostel facilities we have in 1971 and in future as well an opportunity of affording our young girls and boys an education in rural surroundings. I have no doubt that every hon. member in this House would like to retain this system of decentralization which we still have in that part of the Free State, i.e. that every town still has its own high school. We want to afford every parent the opportunity of getting his children to school easily. We do not want to see the children there as pupils only, but also want to absorb them into those communities. In those smaller communities there are opportunities for each one of those boys and girls, if they have the qualities of leadership, to allow these to develop and to use them. That depopulated area in our part of the world has many problems, but thank goodness I can swell out my chest with pride at the people whom that area has produced. We hope that circumstances will be so favourable that we will in future be able to produce the same kind of product as we have done in the past.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Smithfield must have had a long sleep since yesterday. The speech that he made should have been made yesterday afternoon. We spoke about the depopulation of the platteland yesterday; it has nothing to do with this debate. I wonder whether he thinks that he is coming in with the stop-press and we must make special way for him.</p>

<p>But I want to get back to the hon. the Minister of Finance for a moment or two. I want to tell him that he reminds me of a boxer. He has been trying to soften the under-belly of the taxpayers. He comes along, nicely and quietly, with his blows in installments at a time when he should not be taxing and he softens up the taxpayers. He is taking R47 million from the taxpayers from the time that this Bill will be passed. He does it in the form of a purchase tax or a sales tax. His tactic is that as soon as the taxpayer gets used to paying the taxes that he is imposing now, supposedly on luxury items and non-essentials which are really essential items, he comes along with the next installment. This is going to be in articles which are essential. He thinks that we will get used to paying taxes in this form, but he still will not reduce the income tax. He will keep the income tax going and still impose, and widen his scope of taxing through, the sales tax. This type of taxation is hitting a particular class of people today who can ill-afford to pay it.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago there was a hue and cry throughout the world as a result of one or two television films that were shown in England. I have not seen them, but to my mind and from what I have read, they appeared to be very biased against South Africa. They did not tell the whole truth of the matter. But these films showed damning evidence of malnutrition existing <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0543"/>in our country. I asked through the Press at the time whether the hon. the Minister of Health would make a statement and tell us whether malnutrition was as widespread and as severe as was reported in these films. I was hoping that he would come forward with a statement and tell the world that it was not severe. He has not done it. I am hoping, for our good name, that he will find time, perhaps in this debate&#x2014;I do not know if he will find time in it, but then surely under the Health Vote&#x2014;to tell us what is being done to combat malnutrition. I am perturbed when I read reports to the effect that in Tswanaland Dr. Nurse has reported and Dr. Wallaston has confirmed that malnutrition in this homeland is extremely rife. He says&#x2014;and again it is confirmed&#x2014;that in June of last year there were 287 patients in his little hospital and of these patients no fewer than 35 children and eight adults were suffering from malnutrition. I cannot believe that these are isolated cases. The hon. the Minister knows and I know that malnutrition can be combated, especially in South Africa where we have the food to give to the people. It could be combated because it costs far more to treat the patient suffering from malnutrition or one of its subsequent diseases like kwashiorkor, pellagra, scurvy or tuberculosis than it would cost us to supply people who are suffering from malnutrition, with food. I have heard over and over again that the difficulty of distributing food is the reason why food cannot be taken to these affected areas. Surely it is not beyond the ability of the Government to devise ways and means to overcome this difficulty and to use either trucks or trains or lorries to take food to these people. Sir, what does it matter if we give it to them for nothing&#x003F; We should supply them with food if they have not the means to buy it. It may cost several million rand to supply them with food but the hon. the Minister knows as well as I do that in his Vote he provided R12 million to combat tuberculosis alone, besides other moneys that were voted for our health services. Sir, we must do it. This is the thing that gives us a bad name.</p>

<p>No, I said that it was the result of bad feeding, and the hon. the Minister knows it.

I have heard of surpluses that farmers are not being allowed to produce&#x2014;surpluses of mealies, milk and citrus. The farmers should be encouraged to produce these foods and we must find ways and means of distributing them to people who are less fortunate than we are.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. It is not only a question of not having the necessary food, but unfortunately these people are not educated to use the food which they do have an opportunity of getting. They do not buy the right food when they have the money to buy it and they do not use it properly; so we need an educational health service but there are no people for this health service. We are short of labour. We are short of labour throughout our services, right throughout the country. This goes on and on and it is allowed to go on while people are dying. It is estimated, as the hon. the Minister probably knows, that something like 80,000 to 100,000 people will die from gastroenteritis, and gastro-enteritis, malnutrition and kwashiorkor are all bound up in one group. The hon. the Minister knows that. We cannot allow this to go on. It is no good our grumbling afterwards if somebody makes propaganda out of these things which are happening in our country. These people are waiting for an opportunity to use this sort of thing against our country; they take this so-called evidence and splash it all over the world. I ask the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet to find ways and means of stopping this. They must do it.</p>

<p>Sir, talking about the distribution of food, it is very interesting to know&#x2014;my farming friends here will be interested to know this&#x2014;that Santa paid as much as 30 cents a gallon at Fort Beaufort for skimmed milk; that oranges have been bought by the Bantu in Soweto for one cent each. There was a terrific demand for them; there was not a pocket of oranges left. The people want them but they have not been able to get them. These oranges were brought there through an agency and were sold immediately. It is a great thing for these people to be able to get oranges and other citrus fruit. I was told that in Zwelitsha a poultry farmer sold 10,000 birds in one and a half days at 70 cents each, and he was left with not a single bird. The <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0544"/>people want to eat but the food is not coming to them.</p>

<p>We have malnutrition in Soweto. The hon. member for Langlaagte challenged a member on this side of the House to show him one single case of malnutrition in Soweto. Sir, I have worked in Soweto and have dealt with these cases. The census that was taken there show that the distribution of milk and the facilities for purchasing it, were quite shocking. The distribution of milk in Soweto is in the hands of 40 Africans. No White dairyman is allowed in Soweto. We can buy a pint of milk in Sea Point for 7 cents; in Soweto they are paying up to 11 cents for a pint of milk. There is no competition there and there is no fixed price for milk there. It is estimated that there are 400,000 people living in Soweto. We all know that this is probably half the actual figure of inhabitants in Soweto. At the moment the consumption of milk in Soweto works out at half an ounce per day per person. It is possible that in some families three or four pints of milk may be consumed. Sir, that is the sort of thing that is happening, and it is not because they are spending their money on other things; it is because they are not able to buy milk there.</p>

<p>There is not enough milk being distributed in the area. These 40 dairymen have a monopoly. Sir, the strange thing is that under the Government&#x2019;s apartheid legislation the dairymen in Soweto must be Black. They will not allow a White person to distribute milk there. But the doctors there must be White. It is only under permit that a Black doctor is allowed to be there. Sir, it is a topsyturvy situation that we have in our country.</p>

<p>Sir, talking about food, brings me to the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. Some of our super market stores decided that they would keep the price of bread lower than the price suggested by the Minister, and the Minister actually threatened to take these people to court because they wanted to give the pensioner the right to buy a loaf of bread at the old price.</p>

Would he have done the same if a tin of caviar was reduced as a catch-line, and would he have wanted to sue the supermarket owner then&#x003F; Now I want to leave this matter for a moment and go on to shortages in the health services which tie up with malnutrition.</p>

<p>For years now I have been telling the Minister and the House that we are not meeting the shortages and not preparing to meet the shortages in the medical and health services of our country. Because of this lack of preparation for the population increase, today we find that we are hopelessly inadequately staffed in almost every hospital in the country. We do not have enough doctors or dentists or nurses or people in the para-medical services, and the position today in regard to the production of doctors is virtually the same as it was years ago, including the fact that we now have a Faculty of Medicine at Stellenbosch, at Pretoria and at Bloemfontein. We will have to wait a long time for the students at Bloemfontein to qualify, and this Government should have instituted a medical school at Bloemfontein 20 years ago when I suggested it here, but they would not do it. The hon. the Minister then, Mr. Jan de Klerk, refused point-blank to have another medical faculty, and the then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, also refused point-blank to introduce another medical faculty. The hon. the Minister now shakes his head when I say that they said no, it was not necessary and it would cost too much money.</p>

This is the type of thing which is happening at our universities. At Pretoria University in 1968 &#x2014;and these are the latest figures I could get&#x2014;in the first year of medicine 464 students enrolled. In the second year, out of that 464, only 176 remained. In the final year, out of the 464, 107 doctors were produced. At Stellenbosch 66 entered and 39 qualified. At Cape Town University 170 entered and 80 qualified. At Witwatersrand 149 entered and 84 qualified. These are the figures for males alone. There are a few extra women students. There was a total entrance of 849 students and 310 of those became doctors. That number of doctors is not sufficient to catch up with the number we need. We have shortages all over.</p>

<p>I will come to that. The same applies to the nursing profession, but there we are faced with another difficulty. Not only is there a shortage of women going in for the profession, but on top of that we have competition from outside, from the nursing homes, and we cannot keep our nurses at the provincial or State hospitals. We have some loyal ones who stay with us, but why should a nurse work for a certain salary when she can get twice as much in a private nursing home&#x003F; The result is that you have to go into competition. The wards today are denuded of nurses. There are wards standing open without a single patient. The beds are there, but there is not a patient lying in those beds because there are no nurses to look after the patients. What are we going to do about it&#x003F; The demands of the nursing homes become heavier and heavier. Those people who belong to medical aid schemes are finding the demands on their schemes becoming heavier and heavier because these people have to be admitted into nursing homes today and the fees at nursing homes, as the hon. the Minister knows, are in most cases out of the reach of the middle class patient.</p>

<p>I want the Minister to hear this because I do not think he <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0546"/>knows it. At intern level a White doctor gets R4,050 a year. A Coloured or an Indian doctor gets R2,880 a year, and an African doctor gets R2,520. The Bantu doctor gets almost R2,000 less than the White doctor.</p>

<p>Now, remember where the Bantu doctor is working. Remember where he is qualified and what qualifications he has. Who looks after more patients&#x003F; The Bantu doctor at Baragwanath or the White doctor in the general hospital&#x003F; What is the turn-over that goes through a Bantu doctor&#x2019;s hands at a Bantu hospital&#x003F; He has to work many more hours during the day. It is not a job from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. as the hon. the Minister well knows. They go on till they finish their work.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to refer here to a few statements made by the hon. member for Rosettenville, who has just resumed his seat. Firstly I want to refer to the question of milk. He spoke of the high price paid for skimmed milk. The one example mentioned was that of Beaufort West, where 40 cents were paid for a gallon of skimmed milk. We must now give the matter careful thought. Beaufort West is in the hard grip of a very serious drought. There is probably no skimmed milk available at all. Now this example is wrenched out of context in order to create the impression that this is the position in our country. I am very certain that water could perhaps also be sold at some stage. That is surely not to say that we do not have water in our country. These are exceptionally serious drought conditions that are being used here as an example.</p>

<p>It is also said that in Soweto they pay 11 cents for a pint of milk. I can give the assurance that every Bantu township of Soweto has a milk depot where milk is delivered daily at the same price as it is delivered elsewhere. In addition there is a Bantu feeding scheme which daily sells two slices of bread with peanut butter and a half a pint of milk for one cent. These conditions are then exploited in order to show how bad matters are and what a maldistribution of food there is. I believe they do it to let the people outside hear what they allege is going on here in our country, thereby bringing our country into disrepute and blackening our name.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of nurses. As far as I know the training of nurses is conducted by the Provincial Administration. The whole matter boils down to the fact that in all branches of our society we have a very great shortage of labour. I do not know whether it is the United Party&#x2019;s policy, but the hon. member declared here that we could simply use Bantu, Coloureds and Indians as nurses. If it is the Opposition&#x2019;s policy that where there is a shortage the gates should be thrown open and non-Whites let in, then I wonder what is going to become of us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wainwright">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. J. S. WAINWRIGHT</person>:</from>

<p>Where did he say that&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Here another voice is raised. They know what the implications of the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2019;s statement are. He stated it very clearly and unequivocally. First he qualified it. First he said he was speaking about Coloureds. He said that Coloureds should be used as nurses. Subsequently he said that Bantu and Indians could also be used. Now there is the noise coming that indicates they did not listen to what their people said. What actually are the implications of this statement&#x003F; I shall come back to that.</p>

<p>I just want to mention another matter, which the hon. member for Rosettenville touched upon, i.e. that doctors do not receive the same salaries. But when the question was asked specifically he said that there must in fact be a difference. Then what must this difference be&#x003F; Now it is a question of degree. He agrees that there must be a difference. It is therefore not a case of the hon. member pleading here for equal pay for all persons. He wants to discriminate. He wants a difference, but his argument is that the difference must now be less. I should like to know how big the difference must be. I am afraid the hon. Opposition is keeping silent now.</p>

<p>Here we are dealing with a Little Budget and with a debate that has already been in progress for the past three days. We heard quite a lot here about financial matters. I think we are all agreed that there are things in our economy that must be put right, just as the necessary medical help must be given when a person is not altogether healthy. In such a case one surely goes to a doctor, and he gives one a prescription. And that is our present economic position. We realize that over-spending is our biggest evil. As far as I am concerned that is one of the shortcomings in our economic system. The United Party is dissatisfied about the fact that a purchase tax was announced in a Little Budget. They would prefer to have had it done in the general Budget. I believe that it is a fault in our entire system. If I become ill up-country I cannot wait until parliament is in session to be treated then by a doctor down here in the Cape. In that way I also believe that the powers should be in the hands of an hon. Minister of Finance to take the necessary steps immediately, if he thinks it necessary, even though Parliament is not in session. He must have the power to declare an increase in taxation when he regards it as necessary, so that the matter <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0548"/>can be put right as quickly as possible. He is, however, responsible to Parliament and he must submit such measures to Parliament when it is in session. I really think this is necessary. It is already the practice in other countries. In my opinion it is necessary for us to place those powers in the hands of the hon. the Minister so that he will be empowered to institute monetary or fiscal measures when he regards it as necessary, and so that it will not be necessary for him to wait until Parliament is once again in session.</p>

<p>On looking back we realize that our country&#x2019;s growth took place gradually. Since 1948 we have seen that gradual growth in our country year after year. If we look at the statistics we see that our gross domestic production in 1948 was R1,500 million. In the past year it was more than R12,000 million. The growth over the years has therefore been a gradual one. The Economic Advisory Council also determined that we should strive for a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent. Yesterday on the radio I heard that the Economic Advisory Council once more recommended a growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent. There is nothing seriously wrong at the core of our country&#x2019;s economy. It is just that a wild spirit of excessive extravagance has taken hold. There is a tremendous spending urge amongst the public. Our savings in the past three years have decreased by half, to 6 per cent. That is why it is essential for the necessary monetary and fiscal measures to be used to put this matter right.</p>

<p>During the no-confidence debate the United Party was already making a great fuss here about their ability to take over the Government, and they declared themselves prepared to do it now. I believe it was only an attempt to conceal the division in their own ranks, the splits and cracks that there are, because they see that the National Party, after having cleaned out its own house, after having plucked the few scales of the Hertzogites from its bosom, stands as a strong unit.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>What about the other scabs that are coming&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, any moment from now I shall show that hon. member a few scabs. The United Party is not consistent. Once again we have just heard how resounding was the protest when the hon. member for Rosettenville advocated a certain matter. They know they do not all agree with the liberalism that prevails in their ranks. We think back to the hon. member for South Coast who, during the previous session, objected to the fact that Bantu are doing unskilled labour that was earlier done by Whites. I can quote the hon. member&#x2019;s allegation from Hansard for you. In the same breath, however, the United Party opposes us because we want to maintain the colour bar. The United Party&#x2019;s solution is specifically the removal of the colour bar.</p>

<p>The United Party&#x2019;s recipe for the over-spending and for our unfavourable trade balance has three main points, which are propagated by them. The first is that more labour should be brought in. The second is a &#x201C;crash training programme&#x201D; and the third is the 10 per cent growth rate. In all humility I want to try to prove today that if their policy is carried out, and if they were to come into power tomorrow and could implement these main points, South Africa would be sitting with a black government within the space of 10 years. Hon. members may laugh, but I shall prove to hon. members with figures what the implications of that policy of a &#x201C;crash training programme&#x2019; and a 10 per cent growth rate will be. If one wants to maintain a 10 per cent growth rate one must also calculate the labour potential this would require, apart from where we are going to get the capital. We know that last year in its election manifesto the United Party gave a guarantee to the White worker. It guaranteed the White worker the same salary for 10 years. That sounds very good. In the meantime we have, of course, given a 12&#x00BD; per cent increase to the officials, and this they would not have received if the United Party was in power, because they want to maintain that <i>status quo.</i> They want to guarantee them the same salary for 10 years. What would be the further consequences&#x003F;</p>

<p>If that policy of theirs, a policy in which they carry on about the so-called petty apartheid, which an hon. front-bencher gave a definition for, is implemented, these discriminatory acts will be done away with. All the measures and acts that give offence must, according to them, be done away with. In other words, they mean, <i>inter alia,</i> that these separate residential areas must be done away with, because they give offence. This also includes the separate facilities on trains, and they must also be done away with, according to them. On the sportsfields all the facilities will have to <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0549"/>be placed at everyone&#x2019;s disposal. This would also entail the abolition of job reservation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The United Party believes that it will check this overspending by achieving a higher growth rate. They do not want to obtain it by developing border areas, they want to obtain it in White areas. This would, however, bring in a stream of non-Whites and result in a very costly infrastructure. But the big question is, and I want to make it very clear here, that in order to obtain a 10 per cent growth rate we need 275,000 trained White workers annually. Those 275,000 trained White workers will, of course, have to be immigrants. We shall therefore have to bring immigrants into the country. In order to obtain 275,000 trained White workers, with families and all, an annual total of more than 800,000 immigrants will have to be brought into the country. And that is not the worst of it. If one employs that number of Whites in order to maintain the additional growth rate of 4&#x00BD; per cent, one must employ 1.1 million more Bantu annually. If a Bantu family consists of five people, usually it is much more, it means that an additional 5.5 million Bantu are being brought to our White areas.</p>

<p>I am not talking about ordinary circumstances now. These people are necessary if an additional growth rate of 4.5 per cent must be maintained. However, in order to have a growth rate of 10 per cent many more Bantu are necessary. Now I come to the point I want to make. Let us see where we will be in 10 years&#x2019; time if the United Party were to come into power today. What would the picture be then&#x003F; Eight million immigrants would have to come into the country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Is it right&#x003F; Hon. members opposite make a great fuss because this Government allows 30,000 to 40,000 immigrants to come to South Africa annually. They say that the Government is carrying out the United Party&#x2019;s policy. We hear these stories every day in the platteland, and they were also used before the election. This story is as far from the truth as all the other stories they tell every day. The fact is that when the United Party, after the Second World War, wanted to bring immigrants to South Africa in their thousands, we did not even have enough food for our own people. Our people queued in front of the butchers, and mielie-meal was mixed to make bread with. But the fact that there was not enough food was not the worst of it. There was no housing either; material for housing was not available at all. Every immigrant that was then brought in by the United Party was placed in a house from which one of our own people was turned out. Our own people then had to live in shanties in back yards. But worse even was the fact that our own people did not have work. Every immigrant who entered the country then took the bread out of our own people&#x2019;s hands, took their work and took the roofs from over their heads. Our own people were then pushed into the street. Those are the conditions under which the United Party brought immigrants into the country. Now, however, they speak of comparable circumstances. Today this Government also brings immigrants into the country, but there is sufficient work, food and housing. The circumstances are not in any way comparable. I mention these things just to put the matter straight for the record. If the United Party comes into power, South Africa will have a black Government within 10 years. Within 10 years we shall have eight million immigrants in our country, as well as at least 55 million Bantu in our White areas.</p>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Where do we get them&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The United Party now sees for itself that its policy is impracticable. That is the United Party policy. They want to maintain a growth rate of 10 per cent. That is the implication of it, and now they are trying to evade it. If we now have those eight million immigrants in our midst, together with 55 million <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0550"/> Bantu, what snowball&#x2019;s hope has a White South African to come into his own&#x003F; For me it is as clear as daylight that if we accede to what the Opposition suggests, it would mean the destruction of the White civilization here on the southern tip of Africa.</p>

<p>Our present problems with the balance of payments are a direct result of our rapid growth. While we should have been growing at the rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent, in 1969 we grew at the rate of 7.6 per cent. That was a mistake; perhaps we were pressured to such an extent by the United Party. But the fact remains that all available means were subject to pressure. I am now thinking of the available labour and our investment capital. Demand exceeded supply. Wages and salaries increased and so did interest rates. In other words, capital became more expensive. Increased growth is therefore directly responsible for the increase in our production costs, and the increased demands for labour brought about a decrease in the productivity of our workers. Higher wages and salaries created a greater measure of prosperity and are responsible for a greater demand for consumer goods. This greater demand for consumer goods brought about greater imports. Unfortunately our productivity did not keep pace with that. Greater imports cause an unfavourable balance of payments and also greater pressure on the creation of the necessary infrastructure. From this it appears that a high growth rate is wrong. Therefore the entire argument of the United Party and all its pleas are wrong. We can argue as we like, but there is only one thing that can put the matter right. The people of South Africa, every person, must in the first place exert himself to save more and spend less. We are living beyond our means. Then we must also increase our production. At this stage we must increase our savings to form extra capital and create the necessary infrastructure with it. It is necessary for us to increase savings. This purchase tax that is aimed at doing that is one of the fiscal measures taken to cure the disease. We may allow this wild spirit of excessive extravagance to rage on. We are living at an altogether too high level. Everything we do is too luxurious. Our own homes, our furniture and our motor vehicles are too luxurious. Therefore, in all humility I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that in future he makes provision for particularly the lighter motor vehicles, perhaps those costing less than R2,500 or perhaps less than R3,000, to be taxed more lightly.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have just listened to a remarkable speech by the hon. member for Bloemfontein District, who dealt with the question of Coloured and Bantu nursing. Apparently in his constituency there are no hospitals, or he is out of touch with the nursing and the medical profession. I think the hon. the Minister of Health should tell him exactly what the position is as far as the use of Bantu, Coloured and, I understand, Indian nurses is concerned. Sir, I think you will find that most of our hospitals in this country today including our teaching hospitals, with the shortage of manpower, they are making full use of Coloured nurses. We have a training school for Coloured nurses here in Cape Town and we are now building a new one. There is a very large hospital being built on the Cape Flats and its main source of nurses will be from the Coloured community. I think the Government themselves have recognized the fact that we cannot do without Coloured and Bantu nurses in the hospitals. Take the big institutions that we have on the Witwatersrand. They could not run those hospitals without the assistance of Bantu nursing staff.</p>

<p>Sir, in the course of his ramblings the hon. member mentioned the question of increased taxation by remote control. The <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0551"/>hon. the Minister of Finance reminded us at a previous session that he would like to have the power to increase the pay-as-you-earn taxation without having to come to this House beforehand for approval; he would then merely lay the papers on the Table of the House the following session. That, of course, is in line with the policy which this Government seeks to adopt. We have other measures that we are dealing with at the moment where this House is being relegated to a secondary position. Sir, I think when it comes to taxation this House should decide what people should pay. The Minister should not have the right to come to us afterwards and say that he has increased the tax by so much. We are rather upset and disturbed at what is happening in the Post Office, as has been mentioned here today, and we would not like to see the hon. the Minister of Finance coming along with measures such as those which the hon. member for Bloemfontein District seems to be proposing.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member talked about the house-cleaning undertaken by the Nationalist Party in order to get rid of certain elements. I wonder whether they have. I think we should leave it at that because we feel that there are still big troubles in the governing party, and if they want to get rid of their troubles they should use a very much stronger vacuum cleaner. Sir, I do not want to go into the hon. member&#x2019;s theory on colour; I just did not understand it, but I hope to deal with the question of immigration later on.</p>

<p>We have listened here today to the speech made by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark. We are getting a little tired on this side of the House of being told what the Government has done as far as industry is concerned. We are always having &#x201C;Iscor, Iscor, Iscor&#x201D; flung at us. The foundation of our whole industrial empire was laid during the war years when we had to fight a war. The big industries in the hon. member&#x2019;s own constituency of Vanderbijlpark &#x2014;I am sorry he is not here&#x2014;were started during the war years under the inspiration of this side of the House. The Government therefore cannot take credit for these industries because they were established under the inspiration of the United Party Government. In the hon. member&#x2019;s own constituency more war materials were produced during World War II than anybody will ever know. Those industries at Vanderbijlpark&#x2014;the hive of industry&#x2014;helped us to win the war. Listening to hon. members on that side, however, one gets the idea that we did nothing in our time to promote industry.</p>

<p>To come back to the Part Appropriation debate, you will have noticed, Sir, that none of the Ministers other than the Minister of Finance have so far taken part in this most important debate, the first debate we are having in this House after the general election in which the Government slid back, and the Provincial election in which they slid back further. In spite of the importance of this debate, no Ministers have come forward to deal with the policies of their particular departments. They have been sitting here without taking part in the debate. I have the impression that the Whips are looking for speakers on that side in this particular debate.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words on the question of inflation. You will recall, Sir, that the former member for Constantia, Mr. Waterson, warned this Government for years of creeping inflation that we are experiencing at that time. The Government was warned by us to take measures against it. When those warnings were issued, Mr. Waterson was just laughed at. He was told that these stories of his were just so many spook stories to frighten the electorate. With inflation getting out of hand to the extent to which it is today &#x2026;</p>

<p>That is what the hon. member thinks. The Government apparently has no answer to this problem. When one examines the measures suggested in this Part Appropriation Bill to slow down the economy and to check inflation, one gets the impression that they are hit-and-miss measures; that the Government is living from day to day and that they have no real policy to halt inflation. One gets the impression that they are simply hoping for something to turn up.</p>

<p>Sir. take the serious state of our export market at the moment. This has resulted in the adverse balance of payments that we are faced with today. We are also going to have to contend with the effect of Great Britain&#x2019;s joining the European Common Market. What is the effect of this going to <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0552"/>be upon us&#x003F; We have not heard what the Government intended doing; we have not heard what the Government is going to do to stimulate the export market. It has shown a complete lack of initiative in devising plans to help this country in its present state. Sir, when we had a boom period, the Government did not know how to handle it. Today we are faced with the problem of inflation, and what do we get&#x003F; We get these hit-or-miss measures which have been put before us. Where other countries have been faced with similar situations, their Governments have got down to it and dealt with the problem, but in those countries they have the advantage that the governments have the people behind them. Unfortunately this Government has not been able to mould the White people of this country into one nation.</p>

<p>They have done everything to upset the two groups in this country and we have not been able to weld this country as one and as a unit in order to pull this country right. Take, for instance, our exports. One does not like to see raw products such as iron ore go out of the country unprocessed, but in the meantime these could earn us considerable revenue. But what has the Government done&#x003F; They have invited overseas countries to come and examine the position as to whether they should build a railway here or a port there, but when we see what happens in Australia where industry and mining have been encouraged and new railways have been built approximately 18 months after they opened a mine they are exporting the ore through new ports and railway lines. We are still talking about which port to use. Here we have the most wonderful opportunity of exporting coal through our ports, but now we find that the railways do not have the capacity. We will deal with that matter later, but it shows up the lack of initiative by the Government to do something to put us on the export market. I am not satisfied that the market overseas is saturated to such an extent that there is very little that we can sell over there. I do not think that is the case because at the present moment many countries are importing from other countries and we are also importing. One only has to see what happens in Japan.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville was telling us about the third stage in regard to the production of a South African car by the motor industry. I think the Minister of Economic Affairs knows about the warnings that have been sounded over the years. They have been told to hasten slowly because this country has a very small White population. Therefore a small market will have to bear the burden of our producing our own car. We do not have the volume market. The dies and the other equipment required are very expensive and today we are paying for it by paying a lot more for our cars. The hon. member for Yeoville has appealed to the hon. the Minister to give it second thoughts, and at this stage to slow down the application of this third phase. I think if we had an export market for our motor manufacturist in S.A. components we could probably produce a car as cheaply as any other country in the world. But at the present moment we just do not have that market and it makes our vehicles very expensive.</p>

<p>I said in the beginning that I think everyone is disappointed, not only in this House but outside, that there have been no pronouncements of policy by Ministers of the Government in this first Session after the election. I know they may be feeling depressed by their losses in the provincial elections and it may be that they have troubles in their Party. I do not know. One can only sense that there is something wrong. But the country would have liked to hear what the Government&#x2019;s approach is to the very serious labour position that exists in this country today. I do not want to use the word &#x201C;crisis&#x201D;, but we are getting very near it. One reads reports of various departments, invariably the report ends by saying that owing to the shortage of staff they cannot do this or that. One finds that position right throughout the Government Service, and not only there but also in commerce and industry. The Minister talks about labour piracy; he does not like to see labour piracy amongst employers, nor does he like to see outside firms taking away Government employees, but I can tell him that the position today is that the labour is just not available. If big businesses have to carry on, they must get experts somewhere and they have to pay them. That does not help South Africa because it becomes more costly to operate. The feeling is that immigration will help us but we have missed the boat through the Government cutting down on our immigration scheme, and today the immigrants are not available. One must understand that conditions overseas and the standards of <span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0553"/>living of technicians are very much higher than in this country in many cases. This Government has no social security policy, and there people have health services and pension schemes in the countries where they come from which we do not have here. We offer no incentive to the workers to come to this country. If you speak to the immigrant workers, they say they like the sun but there is no pension scheme here and there is no health scheme. Television is something like the bicycle in this country. We wonder whether the bicycle has come to stay, and we wonder whether we will ever get television in this country.</p>

<p>I do not think television is socialism. I think it is a necessity. [Interjection.] Prominent financiers and bankers have tried to explain to the Government that there is a shortage of labour. The fantastic turnover in staff that industry has to face is having the tendency to lower productivity. Productivity in our country is very much lower than it should be, but you can only overcome this problem where you have a permanent, settled staff. Take the Western Cape, where we have the migrant Bantu labour system. You can keep your Bantu workers for a year. Then they have to go home and it may be that you will get them back, but no factory can operate on that basis. That is one of the brainchildren of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, having migrant labour and bringing the Bantu in and out, and you cannot expect to get anywhere on that basis.</p>

<p>What do you suggest&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I am suggesting a settled labour force and not what we have at present, this going backwards and forwards. We just have to see the difficulties our farmers have to get labour on their farms. They have to trek for miles to recruit labour the terrific cost to themselves of having to obtain that labour, and how they have to go out on the Cape Flats and sit there a whole week-end trying to recruit a handful of labourers to take to their farms. That is our labour situation in this country and we cannot carry on on that basis. Years ago this party suggested that it was time that we had a conference to find out what the position was in regard to labour and to make a concerted effort to overcome the difficulty, but nothing happened because the ideological policies of this Government are such that they are prepared to put these policies before the prosperity and the wellbeing of this country. They are obsessed with this idea of the small White state operating on its own and possibly being all White in theory. While you have those theories and those ideologies, your country will suffer where other countries have been able to go ahead by making the best possible use of the labour available. [Interjections.] This does not mean opening the floodgates and allowing all the Bantu in. That is just so much rubbish. We on this side of the House were responsible for introducing influx control. We recognize the difficulty involved in trying to house thousands of Bantu in and near our cities.</p>

<p>At the same time this Government, with its policies of decentralization and border development, has not succeeded. In terms of their policy one area is 12 miles from the centre of Pretoria, and one can hardly call that border development. There are other areas, too, but what happens when industrialists wish to go there because they cannot obtain labour in the cities&#x003F; They are held up by inter-departmental red tape. So, Sir, we muddle on from one difficulty to another and this country has to suffer as a result. The Minister of Transport could teach this Government a few things. I do not know why they do not listen to him. When he is short of labour on the railways, he makes use of Bantu labour, whether the trade unions agree or not. We believe that if there is any change as far as colour in industry is concerned, there must be full consultation with the labour associations and the trade unions. We do not believe that these changes should be made without consultation.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Ask the Minister of Transport. He will tell you. Another point I want to make is that when it comes to overcoming our labour shortage, we are not going to get relief from outside, at least not to the extent that some people in this House think we are. We shall have to turn our attention to education in order to produce technicians from the available labour. We have to make the best possible <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0554"/>use of our White, Coloured and Bantu labour. Therefore we have to look to the training of these people in order to ensure the best possible use of each unit. We do not do so at the present moment. The hon. member for Hillbrow introduced his Manpower Training Bill, which was aimed at just that, but it was rejected. I should like to tell the House that industry itself has funds, protected by legislation passed in this House, which it uses to train the youth in all possible ways, to produce better technicians, and to combat the brain wastage we have in this country. The mines and our large industries, such as the motor industry, have training schools in an attempt to retain every possible person, but the Government just sits back. Let us take the case of Westlake to illustrate this. As the hon. member for Simonstad will tell you we have the finest adult training scheme for trades at Westlake, but this scheme, for some reason, receives extremely poor support from the public. Let us not have various Ministers like the Minister of Bantu Administration destroying the whole foundation of this country&#x2019;s growth potential. We have often heard that South Africa should be the workshop of the African Continent. It should be and it could be, but what is happening&#x003F; We find certain Ministers and departments doing their best to slow down our development as the workshop of the African continent.</p>

<p>We in this country are very fortunate. We have heard from the hon. member for Simonstad about the exploitation of our fishing resources, and it is fortunate that we produce gold in this country. One wonders what would have happened had we not been a gold producer. That has been our saving grace. It is also possible that we have become too soft because of our reliance on gold. I do feel that the Government should take note of this. The gold is there, but this Government has to do something to build the country up as a large exporter. We cannot do it unless the Government unifies the White races in this country and works hand in hand with industry to build the country up. I can say this to the House that everybody outside is going to check on what the Government intends doing, and if the Government cannot do anything, they will have to get out and someone else will be put in power who can do it. The position in this country is very, very serious.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is a good idea that a maiden speech be made as a diversion in the heat of a political debate. I want to say that I am very honoured to take my place among the hon. members of this House and, in addition, that I regard it as a privilege to represent the Bellville constituency here. If I ask myself in what spirit I must perform my work in and around this honourable House, I want to associate myself with the motto on the civic crest of Bellville. It is an old French moto; <i>Prendre sa Belle.</i> This motto has three different interpretations. The more spirited ones among us, or perhaps the over-spirited ones, translate it as &#x201C;Grab his pretty girl&#x201D;, which we do not regard as being in quite the right spirit. The balanced ones among us translate the motto as &#x201C;Retain the beautiful&#x201D;. This is almost in the same sense as that in which a celebrated national leader once said: &#x201C;Take from the past what is beautiful and noble and build the future on it&#x201D;. If I could use that as the basis for my actions in and around this House, I would be grateful. There is a third interpretation as well, namely that of &#x201C;Seize the opportunity&#x201D; or, as the other Latin saying goes: <i>&#x201C;Carpe diem&#x2019;&#x2019;.</i></p>

<p>In the first place, I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to pay tribute to my predecessor in this House, Jan Haak. He served his constituency, his Government and his country with distinction. Although I regard it as a privilege to be able to stand up here in his place, I still feel it is a pity that in his constituency and in the country as a whole we have had to lose his services.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the idea of <i>Prendre sa Belle,</i> or &#x201C;Retain the Good&#x201D;. I want to say that there are few hon. members <span class="col_1083-1084" refersTo="page_0555"/>who, when they come to the Cape for the Parliamentary session, do not have to drive through the constituency of Bellville in order to get here. This being the case, I would say that it is my privilege to be the first welcome hon. members who come to Cape Town in the Peninsula and to tell them about all the beautiful and good things which are to be found and which happen in and around this Peninsula. For example, there are the beautiful beaches of Clifton with the beautiful view of the sea. When we were there in our young days, we did not see much of the sea, but nowadays we see the sea! These days, when one goes there in the company of one&#x2019;s wife, she would prefer one to wear blinkers. But I do not think blinkers add to one&#x2019;s appearance&#x2014;neither at Clifton nor in politics. In addition, there is the beautiful coastline of Simonstown, and the hon. member for Simonstown will recall that on two occasions he and I have already had the opportunity of becoming thoroughly acquainted with the coast and the voters of Simonstown. Those were pleasant days. We are grateful for the opportunity they gave us to become schooled in politics.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Mr. Speaker, we also have interesting people in the Peninsula; people of all shades of political opinion. We have the sometimes nearly have young Progressives, one of whom wrote to me recently and congratulated me on my election. In his letter he said that he would rather speak to me than to anybody from the United Party. I do not know why he should say that, because in the past I always found dialogue with the United Party or the Progressive Party very interesting. In fact, I have taken part in quite a number of these discussions. The honourable and charming member for Wynberg will know that we shared a political platform on one or two occasions, putting forward the policies of our respective parties. The hon. member for Maitland will know that we shared the same sort of experience. While we were both members of the Provincial Council and sitting quite near to each other, we had a constant dialogue over the floor of the House. It was quite entertaining at times. I was grateful for the opportunity of discussing matters with members even of the United Party.</p>

<p>*In addition, there are people with other shades of political opinion, pleasant people and friendly people, in the Peninsula. Besides the hon. member for Maitland, who is a constituent of mine, I should like to refer to two other constituents of mine in this House, namely the hon. members for Moorreesburg and Malmesbury. They are good Nationalists. The old saying goes that you cannot quarrel with your bread and butter. My only problem now is to find out whether they are verkrampte or verligte Nationalists. In this respect I am in some difficulty. Furthermore we have some perfectly ordinary, wonderful people here in the Peninsula. We quarrel and argue with each other in the way that decent people should. But when we come together again, we attend Communion together. There are a few snobs and such like too.</p>

<p>But I should like to avail myself of the time of the House to address it briefly about the need for an investigation into the question of whether fire-brigade services in South Africa are organized as well as they can possibly be. My attention was recently drawn to this matter by an action committee for the promotion of emergency and fire-brigade services. This committee was composed mainly of persons from the Western Cape who had undertaken an overseas tour in 1970 to the Continent of Europe, Britain and Israel, where they had paid particular attention to the organization of fire-brigade services in those specific countries. They paid particular attention to training facilities, organization and administration, equipment and the very important aspect of civil protection. I hasten to add that it is not my impression that fire-brigade services in South Africa are in any way in a chaotic state or anything of that nature. On the contrary, I want to make the observation that with the available funds and facilities the standard of our fire-brigade services is exceptionally high. The question is simply whether the existing shortcomings should not be investigated and whether ways and means cannot be found of organizing these services on an even better and more efficient basis than at present.</p>

<p>An investigation could have regard to the following aspects. In the first place, there are the administration and organization. The question may be asked whether the present level of control, i.e. our local authorities, and especially the Town Clerk departments controlling it, is the best level of control. In the second place, what is the best way in which these services can be financed&#x003F; Must they remain the burden of local authorities alone or should other <span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0556"/>ways and means be found of contributing towards the cost&#x003F; There is the question of uniform training facilities throughout the country. At the moment training is given on a sporadic basis at each individual fire-brigade unit. It is true that the South African Fire Brigade Institute provides guidance to the fire-brigade services, but the training is given on a sporadic basis from one fire-brigade service to the next. The question is whether opportunities should not be created for this training to be centrally and uniformly controlled. There is the question of uniform salary scales. At the moment these do not exist, with the result that one fire-brigade service entices away the staff of another, thus creating an anomalous state of affairs. There is the question of staffing fire-brigade stations fully. My information is that in spite of the fact that the committee charged with emergency services in South Africa prescribed certain standards to the town councils in regard to fire-brigade services, few of the town councils are able, with the means and the staff at their disposal, to bring those services up to the standard required for our civil protection services. There are other important aspects to which I should like to return, and these are the standardization of equipment in order to ensure greater interchangeability and cost saving, and the extension of the fire-brigade&#x2019;s function as rescue service and its integration with civil defence services. I should like to dwell briefly upon four aspects, namely the organization and administration, the financing and the equipment of the services and their integration with the civil defence services.</p>

<p>In regard to the organization and administration, it is generally known that most fire-brigade services are the responsibility of our municipalities. In addition, divisional councils, the Department of Forestry and the harbour authorities have certain limited functions. However, providing these services is mainly the function of our municipalities. This is also the position which obtained in Great Britain until approximately 1941. In that year of crisis during the war, the British Government found that the services were no longer functioning efficiently. Consequently, the fire-brigade services in that country were taken over by the State. Subsequently they were organized on a regional basis, with the result that the whole of Britain is today covered by fire-brigade services. This is not the case in our country. Here these services are simply organized from one town to the next. To my personal loss, I found that there was an inadequate fire-brigade service at a place like Betty&#x2019;s Bay. Last year 23 houses burnt down at Betty&#x2019;s Bay as a result of there being no adequate fire-brigade service. In the absence of uniform legislation, the municipalities are prevented from providing fire-brigade services outside their own areas. Sometimes they are in fact allowed to do so, but then only with the permission of the town clerk or the mayor. He must first be traced and telephoned, and by the time one has traced him, the fire has already burnt itself out In regard to these matters, namely the organization of the fire-brigade services so that they can cover a wider field and be placed on a regional basis, I am satisfied that they can in fact receive and enjoy thorough attention from the authorities. The question is whether a special department of fire-brigade services should not be created under the authority of the Provincial Council. It can be done in the same way as we have hospital services under that council. On the other hand, the question can also be asked whether fire-brigade services should not come under the Department of the Interior, although I am not really in favour of that at this stage. Most fire-brigade services in the European countries, however, fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Perhaps the Department of Defence can take the lead as well, especially with a view to civil defence. This is the position in countries such as Switzerland and to a certain extent in Germany as well. This is all I have to say in regard to organization.</p>

<p>In regard to the financial implications, I must point out that most local authorities find the capital and running expenses too high to maintain these fire-brigade services at full strength and at the maximum level of efficiency. So much so that when economies are introduced in a budget, one usually finds that they are introduced here first, with the result that the level of efficiency later borders on inefficiency. In most European countries fire brigades have their expenses subsidized to the tune of 20 to 25 per cent by the central government, which is not the case in this country. I am aware of the fact that the Civil Defence Services recently made a considerable donation to certain fire brigades in target areas. I know that these donations came to a considerable amount, but it was a non-recurrent amount and not one which is made available <span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0557"/>to fire brigade services for their maintenance. Moreover, few hon. members will know that the premiums which they pay on their fire insurance depend on the standard of the fire brigades in their particular home towns. Whether you pay 75 cents per thousand rand of the value of your property, as in Bellville, or 50 cents per thousand rand, as in the case of Parow, the premiums depend on the standard of the fire-brigade services in the various municipal areas. In this respect, too, there are a number of anomalies. I have found that some fire brigades which compare very well, nevertheless do not procure for the inhabitants of the municipal areas concerned the benefit of a low premium. This decision rests with a voluntary body which is known as the South African Fire Insurance Council. It is a voluntary body which apparently decides according to its own standards whether the premiums should be 50 cents, 75 cents or R1 per R1,000. This too is a matter which may be profitably investigated.</p>

<p>I now come to the last two points I want to make, namely the question of equipment and the integration of fire-brigades with civil defence service. Fire-brigades virtually rank equally with the South African Police in the second line of our home defence. We must accept this. We now find the phenomenon that orders for fire-brigade equipment take as long as two years to be delivered from abroad. This is an unnecessarily long delay. If one links this with the idea, which it is not a farfetched one, that fire-brigade equipment is in fact in the second line of defence, and one considers the spirit prevailing abroad in respect of the supply of arms to South Africa, one can easily visualize a situation in which the unnecessary delay might eventually lead to deliberate delay. It is my contention that South Africa should be self supporting and independent in regard to fire-brigade equipment. I believe that this aspect may be thoroughly investigated. My information is that fire-brigade engines are already being manufactured locally with imported chassis. Therefore it is not impossible for us to manufacture these engines. The fact of the matter is that unless we view this situation on a larger scale, we may later find that we are getting into difficulties because we cannot obtain proper engines.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the other important question of the interchangeability and standardization of fire-brigade equipment. The fire-brigade engines of Bellville and Parow, for example, which have certain linkages for their spraying equipment, cannot be used in the municipal areas of Cape Town and Milnerton unless alternative linkages are bought and other changes are made. I think the standardization of equipment in order to ensure interchangeability is a very important matter which must certainly be investigated. To talk about popular matters; there is the important question whether fire-brigade engines must necessarily be red. In Europe at the moment the tendency is towards a bright yellow, which is much more conspicuous. Furthermore, there is the other question whether uniforms must necessarily be black. We all know that black is heat-absorbing instead of heat-resistant. White is heat-resistant. These uniforms should therefore really be white. There is the question of sirens instead of hooters, etc. I believe there is a tremendous field which can be covered by a proper investigation.</p>

<p>But I should like to come to my last point, namely the question of emergency defence or civil protection. We know what the function of the fire-brigade is, that they pull children from sewage pipes and cats from trees, but moreover, in a period of crisis, they must ensure the safety of the population in my particular area. What is even more important, we are continually looking for an opportunity of placing our civil defence service on a sound basis. At the moment my information is that the civil defence service of the Department of Defence is trying to co-operate with the town clerks of various municipalities, but have not always had the greatest measure of success. According to my information, for example, there are only two members in one of my neighbouring towns who belong to this civil defence service and who have to attend to a population of approximately 16,000 to 20,000. If this is the voluntary basis on which our civil defence services are operating at the moment, I say that we lack proper civil defence services. Of course, I believe that the fire brigade, which exists in every town and has a military discipline of its own or is organized on the basis of military discipline and which is on duty 24 hours a day, can perhaps form the nucleus of a properly organized civil defence service. I believe that this matter may be very thoroughly investigated as well.</p>

<p>The plea I am making here for an investigation is not an isolated one. I am <span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0558"/>aware that the Cape Provincial Council recently sent out circulars to various municipalities to the effect that they must furnish certain data in connection with the state of their respective fire-brigade units. Perhaps this is the beginning of an investigation, but it is not being carried far enough. I believe it can be carried much further than this enquiry on the part of the Provincial Administration.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to point out that in discussing these matters in this House, I am very careful not to create the impression that we should take the matter out of the hands of the Provincial Council. I was a member of that Council and I have the highest regard for the way in which its members carry out their task. I believe it is a very effective and approachable governmental institution and I want to take care that we do not take this work out of their hands. But I believe that we, in the position we occupy here, can make it possible for the four provinces and South-West Africa to co-operate with one another in order to achieve uniformity and proper planning in this field, in the same way as our Department of Transport was the catalyst in regard to uniform traffic road ordinances for the four provinces. I believe we have a function to fulfil in this respect.</p>
