<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>This clause, as in the case of the other clauses of this Bill, increases considerably the penalties and fines which can be imposed by passport control officers. For instance, in this clause we find that the fine is being increased from R200 to R1 000. During the Second Reading stage I raised with the hon. the Deputy Minister the question of supervision or the review of the action of these passport officers. If a magistrate were to <span class="col_6749-6750" refersTo="page_0508"/>impose an equivalent penalty, it would be subject to an automatic review by the Supreme Court, But here the power to impose what is in fact very heavy fines is vested in a passport control officer. By section 5 of Act 38 of 1969 power was given to the Minister to appoint passport control officers without circumscribing or limiting the very wide area from which such appointments could be made. The new section 28 (1) inserted by section 5 of Act 38 of 1969 empowers the Minister to&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) appoint any officer or member of a class of officers in the Public Service as a passport control officer, and</li>

<li>(b) confer upon or assign to any passport control officer or to any class of passport control officers such powers or duties as to the carrying out of this Act&#x2026;</li>

</ol>

<p>The question I want to raise is the status, the standing, of these passport control officers within the Public Service, these officers who are hereby entitled to impose spot fines of up to R1 000. It is presumed that at places such as Jan Smuts Airport and the Table Bay docks, a senior official will be appointed to deal with this matter. Another point is the procedure, if there is to be such, to be followed to review these penalties, either by the Minister himself or by the Secretary for the Interior or for Finance. But I do not know whether such a revision is to take place although I consider it essential that in view of these increased powers there should be at the same time some process of review.</p>

<p>Could the hon. the Deputy Minister clarify these points about the procedure which is to be followed for the purposes of supervision and regarding the status of these officers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point raised a number of problems, which, to my mind, requite an explanation. It is true that passport control officers on various levels of seniority may determine a maximum amount of R1 000 as a deposit. The hon. member should draw a distinction here; it is not a fine; it is a deposit which has to be made and it can be forfeited. Usually the amount is fixed with due regard to the cost of the maintenance of these persons and also with due regard to the cost that has to be incurred in removing such a person. As regards the status of the persons who have to make these decisions at our main gateway of entrance, i.e. at the Jan Smuts Airport, in Cape Town and in Durban, the position is as follows; In Cape Town and in Durban the passport control officer is under the direct guidance and supervision of our regional representative, who, in both cases, is an under-secretary&#x2014; in other words, a responsible official on a high level. At the Jan Smuts Airport we have an administrative control officer, and this person usually obtains his guidance directly from the Deputy Secretary for Passports and Visas. Then there is the other question in regard to costs. I think he should appreciate that an air ticket for sending a person to a far away place can cost a great deal. As far as the question of cost is concerned, arbitrary sums can be determined &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am not disputing the fairness of the amount of R1 000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate that the hon. member is not objecting to the maximum. He only has doubts as to whether it will always be applied with proper circumspection by the proper person on the proper level. In this regard I just want to mention two extremes to the hon. member. For instance, if a person has to be escorted to North Korea or South Korea, one must at least be sure that one can lay down an amount of not more than R1 000- But it is quite a different matter if one has to convey him to the Portuguese border. Any person who feels that he is unfairly being asked to deposit a large amount of money, may appeal to a higher authority; he may go to the Secretary and he may even go to the Minister if he considers it to be absolutely essential. Furthermore, in the end such a person also has the choice of leaving of his own accord, if he wishes to do so. In addition, the person who makes the deposit, has the choice of deciding for himself to remove the person concerned. I think that the doubts in the mind of the hon. member can be removed by these processes and the way in which this type of case is dealt with at present.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. the Deputy Minister for the explanation he has given. I just want to make one thing clear. It is correct that in clause 3 we are <span class="col_6751-6752" refersTo="page_0509"/>dealing with deposits. The same powers are contained in subsequent clauses where it is in fact a fine and where forfeiture is ordered. Sir, one appreciates that it is an under-secretary who will operate in most of the major centres and also that there is a right of appeal to either the Secretary or to the Minister himself in the event of any dispute. Can the hon. the Deputy Minister- give the assurance that people asked to make a deposit are informed that, if they question the amount of their deposit, they have the right to go to higher authority to have the matter reviewed. If they are not informed at the time they make the deposit, will he see to it that they are informed?</p>

</speech>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 7:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Section 20 of the principal Act which is being amended prescribes certain offences and this amending Bill adds another offence. So far as existing offences are concerned, section 20 (a) of the principal Act refers to a person who aids and abets any person in entering or remaining within the Union or any province in contravention of this Act, knowing that person to be prohibited from so entering or remaining. In other words, the offence arises from the knowledge of the person who does the aiding and abetting. In paragraph (b) there is a similar provision-</p>

<block name="quote">A person who aids or abets a person ordered to be removed from the Union in evading the order or harbours any such person, knowing him to be the subject of any such order.</block>

<p>The Bill before us creates the new offence of conveying or causing to be conveyed into the Union any person who is not in possession of a passport or identification documents, if that person is not a South African citizen by birth or descent. Sir, this could be done quite innocently, just as the offences under (a) and (b) could be innocently committed. I believe it would be correct and in keeping with the spirit of the principal Act, if this clause were to be worded in the way in which I have suggested in the amendment which appears on the Order Paper, and which I now move&#x2014;</p>

<p>To omit the proposed paragraph (aA) and to substitute the following paragraph:</p>

<p>(aA) knowing any person, who is not a South African citizen by birth or descent, not to be in possession of an unexpired passport or other document of identity required by section 24 (1), conveys or causes such person to be conveyed into the Union.</p>

<p>In other words, the same <i>mens rea</i> which is required for a conviction under (a) and (b) shall also be required in so far as any conviction under this further provision is concerned. I move accordingly and I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to be good enough to accept that amendment.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I agree entirely with everything that the hon. member for Green Point has said about this, and in support of his plea to restore the knowledge of the commission of an offence, which is contained in the original Act, I would point out to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this amending Bill makes the definition of &#x201C;conveyance&#x201D; very wide indeed and that the definition of &#x201C;passenger&#x201D; also includes &#x201C;stowaway&#x201D;. How anybody could know about a stowaway and be found guilty of conveying such a person who has no passport. I find difficult to understand. With these two additional arguments, Sir, I would like to add my plea to those of the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we must take into consideration the fact that the number of travellers in the world has shown a substantial increase over the past few years, and that the pattern of travelling has also changed. The number of people travelling by air exceeds by far the number of people travelling by ship, and usually these offences, with which we want to deal under this clause, are in fact found amongst air passengers. Our department regularly keeps the airlines of foreign countries informed, from time to time, as to the requirements that are to be met by persons who want to enter South Africa and what travel documents they must have. The greatest problem which we have in this regard, is in connection with people who do not have visas. All the airlines know that there are only four countries in the world whose citizens need not have <span class="col_6753-6754" refersTo="page_0510"/>visas when they enter South Africa, i.e. citizens of the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia and the Principality of Liechtenstein, The airlines are aware that exemptions have only been granted in respect of these four countries. And yet we often find that they come here with passengers who do not have visas, and then they have all sorts of stories to tell when the person concerned lands at the Jan Smuts Airport; sometimes the excuse is that the person&#x2019;s mother suddenly took ill or that she died. In many cases the department tries its best to meet such people halfway, but this very attitude is also being exploited; if they got away with that on one occasion, one finds that next time they want to use the same argument in order to bring people into the country. And we are saddled with them. The moment these unauthorized foreigners have landed in our country, we are saddled with them and then it is our responsibility to see to it that they are removed from this country again.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that it was unfair to place the responsibility for a stowaway on the person in charge of a conveyance, but that is not the case. Who finds it so easy to stow away on an aircraft? If a ship has a stowaway on board and that person wants to disembark at a South African port and we do not want to admit him here, why should we be saddled with him? After all, we did not stow him away. All we expect, is that the master of the ship should assume responsibility for him when his presence becomes known. Why should we have to send him back to the country from which he came? Surely we did not convey him to this country; we did not stow him away. I think this is only fair. That is simply what the position was in the past. After all, these people must at least have a place to sleep and eat on board ship, but the ship arrives here and we are convinced that such people were not always stowaways of whom the master was not aware. Then such stowaways want to enter the country and, of course, when they do not succeed in doing so, the master of the ship concerned wants to hide behind the law and refuses to take any responsibility in respect of these persons. The penalty in respect of this offence mut be a severe one as it must also serve as a deterrent to the various shipping and airlines, especially the latter, in that they should be more careful in respect of the passengers they take aboard and convey to South Africa. Our airline finds itself in the same position in respect of other countries.</p>

<p>At the moment we have a problem with America. If any person alights from an aircraft in the U.S.A. without his having proper travel documents, they immediately ask for 1 000 dollars. At present we have such a case in the S.A. Airways with the American Government, We are therefore not making an exception. It is merely a logical adjustment. The fact of the matter is that it is illegal to bring into the country any person who does not have the necessary travel documents. The Act makes provision for that. We are therefore not creating a new offence here. At present it is an offence for any person to help another person to enter the country unlawfully, to make a false statement in respect of any person in order to bring him into the country, to try to hide any person whom we want to remove from the country. At the moment this is already an offence, and therefore we are not creating a new offence through this amendment. All we are doing is to increase the penalty, and we are placing a greater responsibility on those people who, notwithstanding the fact that they are aware of the offence they are committing, persist in trying to land here people who do not have the necessary travel documents.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. member for Parow. You know. Sir, he never ceases to amaze me. Invariably, if we bring an amendment to this Committee, no matter how good it is, he will find some reason for opposing it, I cannot understand his attitude in opposing this amendment. His closing words were &#x201C;as &#x2019;n mens bewus is van die oortreding&#x201D;. That is exactly what we are trying to put into this clause, so that it should be done knowingly.</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, the hon. member should go and read the Act, and he must read the amendment which is introduced in this Bill, There is no question of <i>mens rea</i> here at all. If makes it a plain and simple offence if somebody introduces somebody whose papers are not in order; not whether he does it knowingly or unwittingly, but just the fact that somebody brings someone else here without papers is an offence.</p>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, this is a new offence which is being created, in terms of section 20 of the Act. I really cannot understand the hon. member. I will agree with everything he says. There is an increase in the number of travellers and more and more people are travelling by aircraft. But I want to ask him, when he talks about people who come in without visas or with incorrect papers, does he want to place the responsibility on the crew of the aircraft? He wants to place the responsibility on the captain of the aircraft to go to every passenger to check whether his papers are in order. [Interjection.] Sir, I ask you, with tears in my eyes, whether he is going to do this to our own pilots, to our own crews of our own South African Airways aircraft, and place the responsibility on the captain of that aircraft to go to every passenger and check that his papers are in order? This is the whole thing that we are trying to obviate, namely to take that responsibility away and to provide that it must be done knowingly. There is a degree of <i>mens rea</i> required. The question of stowaways raised by the hon. member for Houghton does come into this. I am dealing with a ship now and not so much with an aircraft, because in fact you cannot stow away on an aircraft, although it has happened, incidentally. People have arrived in countries by way of an aircraft, by biding in luggage compartments, etc. But in regard to a stowaway on a ship, surely it is only reasonable to expect that the court must prove that the captain was aware that this person was not allowed to enter before he can be charged. On this question of the penalties, we have not queried the increase in the penalties. We accept that this is being brought into line with modern finance. But I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. member for Parow. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will have a more reasonable attitude towards it. I feel that this is a good amendment and one which should be accepted. In the interests of justice it should be accepted. Knowing that the hon. the Deputy Minister is a reasonable man, I will now resume my seat and I hope he will accept the amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_breda">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. VAN BREDA</person>:</from>

<p>I honestly cannot follow the reasoning of the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg District in this regard. It is obvious that he has never read this Act. After all, it is simply absurd and unrealistic to say here that we are now going to expect the captain of the aircraft to check the papers of all the passengers. What is expected in this case, is that the airline responsible for that aircraft should, prior to granting the passengers permission to board that aircraft, discharge the onus of seeing to it that all the travel documents are in order. Does the hon. member think that we want the captain of the aircraft to walk up an down the aisle, like a bus conductor, so as to examine all the tickets? Surely, this is simply not the case. I simply fail to see how the hon. the Deputy Minister can accept this amendment, for if he does one would simply have reverted to the provision standing part of the Act at present.</p>

<p>But there is another aspect to the matter. People are not only being conveyed to the Republic by air or by ship. During the present session we agreed to very severe penalties in respect of people trafficking in drugs, etc. But in the meantime a man may smuggle a person across the borders of the country, knowing only too well that such person does not have the necessary travel documents, or the documents required for being an acceptable person in the Republic of South Africa. What is worse, is that these persons, who are smuggled into the country by these means, may hold a serious threat to the national security. In the light of these possibilities, and especially in this particular juncture in which we find ourselves today, I think the penalty in this respect is, perhaps, still not severe enough, although it has been laid down as a maximum penalty. If this amendment is accepted, the person concerned can only be punished if he knew that the person he conveyed did not have the necessary documents. In other words, on whom would the onus be here to prove that the person who deliberately smuggled another person across our borders, did so knowingly or unwittingly? In other words, one weakens the effect of this clause by allowing the onus of proof to hang in the air.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton raised the question of a stowaway, and wanted to know how this could be the responsibility of the shipping line or the captain of the ship in question. But there is a separate section which makes provision for this question of stowaways, i.e. the proposed section 14 of the Act, under which we can discuss this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from><span class="col_6757-6758" refersTo="page_0512"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I rise just to answer on one or two points raised by the hon. member for Parow and the hon. member for Tygervallei. They have overlooked this fact. The clause we are discussing now is a penal clause. It makes it a criminal offence for the conveyor who contravenes it. That does not affect the other aspects of this Bill. The hon. members would have done well had they done a little homework and read the Bill. Without invoking the penalty clauses, the conveyer can be made to deposit up to R1 000 on arrival of that person and can be made to forfeit that money under certain circumstances. There is no question of &#x201C;aflaaiing&#x201D; to which the hon. member referred. If necessary, the deposit can be asked for.</p>

<p>Now we come to the &#x201C;afskrikking", namely that a penalty may also be imposed. One must keep within the bounds of normal justice when one imposes a criminal as well as a civil obligation. What I am opposed to here is that the criminal obligation which is additional to the civil obligation of making a deposit is based on a blanket liability. I see that the hon. member for Parow is holding up the Order Paper. My amendment deals with the criminal provisions. If the hon. member would look at section 20 of the principal Act, he would see that it provides penalties for offences. We have just approved previous clauses in this Bill. We have approved of the amendments to sections 13 and 14, which entitle a passport control officer to demand a deposit of R1 000 if a person arrives without the right documents. Under section 14 he can order a forfeit under certain circumstances. If the hon. member has not read that far and if he would read clause 13 which we are still coming to, he would see that it says <i>mutatis mutandis</i> the provisions applying to ships apply to aircraft. The clause concerning which I have moved my amendment, purely deals with the creation of a criminal offence. It does not in any way open the door or in any way relieve the responsibility of the conveyer, which can be the airline, to the State to ensure that the State is not involved in expenditure. I hope that the hon. the Minister, knowing that he has these civil rights against the airline or whatever conveyer may be involved, will not also impose the criminal sanctions with regard to such an act unless it is performed knowingly.</p>

<p>I might mention that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department is well aware that certain prominent persons may well have been in serious trouble if this had been law at the time when the yachts assembled in Cape Town for the Cape to Rio race. There were many persons who came out as passengers or crew when the yachts were brought to Cape Town, who were not in possession of the documents required under section 24. I know that the department is aware of this, because I myself made certain representations in that regard. If this had been law at the time, a number of the premier yachtsmen of the world would have been committing offences quite innocently by having crew on their yachts who were not in possession of the right documents.</p>

<p>I want to mention a further point in conclusion, which might finally persuade him to accept my amendment, namely that the hon. the Minister himself, with regard to the amendment we have approved in clause 6 of this Bill, recognizes that it is not always a heinous offence if a person arrives without his documents being in order. Lines 24, 25 and 26 of clause 6 (b), which contains the new section 19 (2) (a), provide that a passport control officer can in fact rectify the papers of a person on arrival if he believes it to be just and equitable to do so.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the principles involved in this amendment are not bad, but we already have a provision which covers the same ground as this amendment. If a person knowingly brings a prohibited person into the Republic, he is already guilty of an offence in terms of the existing <span class="col_6759-6760" refersTo="page_0513"/>section 20 (a). This amendment is therefore unnecessary if we do not intend removing this <i>mens rea</i> principle, and we have good cause for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>Then why hide it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member was worried about that. I am coming to that point. The existing section 20 (a) reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who aids or abets any person in entering or remaining within the Union or any province in contravention of this Act, knowing that person to be prohibited from so entering or remaining &#x2026;</block>

<p>is guilty of an offence. Section 20 now reads: Any person who aids or abets any person who is not in possession of valid travel documents (here we have visas in mind) to enter the Republic is guilty of an offence if the person whom he is aiding and abetting is a prohibited person in terms of section 21. The proposed insertion of paragraph (aA) section 20 will state the law in no uncertain terms. That is the main object of this amendment in section 20. It is aimed mainly at the conveyers of passengers who are not in possession of valid visas for entry into the Republic. Conveyers of passengers, especially by air and sea, and travel agents are fully aware of, and are kept up to date with, the visa requirements of the Republic. However, instances of persons not in possession of the required visas being conveyed into the Republic are increasing at an alarming rate and the factor which must be considered is that the number of persons entering the Republic for a temporary sojourn has increased from approximately 90000 in 1951 to 339 000-plus at present. That is an important factor we have to consider here, although it forms only part of the problem.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, could the hon. the Deputy Minister please clarify that last point about people entering as temporary sojourners? What does he mean by that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking of temporary visitors, tourists, etc. In cases of emergency steps are usually taken to authorize the admission of persons arriving here without visas, but the disregard of our visa requirements in the normal course of events cannot be tolerated. The refusal to land persons usually causes a great deal of pressure. It results in adverse criticism of the department and the Government. I am therefore very sorry that I cannot accept this amendment. As I have said, provision has already been made to cover those matters which the hon. member is worried about. We are removing this <i>mens rea</i> principle because we want to place the onus upon these people to make sure&#x2014;and &#x201C;sure&#x201D; means &#x201C;reasonably sure&#x201D;&#x2014;that they are not conveying a person who could be declared a prohibited immigrant. For instance, if there is a stowaway on a ship and the captain discovers him on board after they have docked, he has a case to put before the court, because a stowaway has actually committed an offence against the company which owns the ship. It is then for the court to decide whether or not the company concerned has a reasonable case. Yesterday such an atmosphere of equanimity reigned in this House that I am really sorry that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the last point made by the hon. the Deputy Minister is not valid at all. The very fact that there is inserted in a later clause, clause 14, a provision that &#x201C; &#x2018;passenger&#x2019;, for the purposes of section 14, includes a stowaway&#x201D; means that he wants the conveyer of the stowaway to be considered as having committed a criminal offence. I think he is giving a guideline to the courts there which is going to make it very difficult indeed for the person so charged to escape a conviction. I think that is very hard indeed. The very nature of the crime of stowing away means that the captain of the ship is not aware of the presence of such a passenger. He is in any case responsible for conveying the stowaway back to his port of embarkation. The point made by the hon. member for Parow is also not valid, because the captain of the ship is not allowed to land the stowaway. The matter is then one between the stowaway and the ship's company. It has nothing to do with the South African Government. We are not responsible for conveying that man back whence he came. That is tire responsibility of the ship&#x2019;s captain, or the aircraft company, whichever it happens to be.</p>

<p>There is a further point I should like to make. The hon. the Deputy Minister has <span class="col_6761-6762" refersTo="page_0514"/>said that airlines and shipping companies are well aware of all our visa requirements. That is probably true, although clerks in offices all over the world make mistakes and tell passengers that they do not need visas for South Africa when they in fact do. They then arrive at Jan Smuts Airport without the necessary travel documents. I had a case only a few weeks ago where someone from a country where visas are required for South Africa came here and was held up at Jan Smuts Airport. It was a perfectly innocent mistake. The woman concerned had been informed by an airline office somewhere in Africa that she did not need a visa. I must say that the department could not have been more helpful. This incident took place on a Sunday and I had to chase around to get hold of the various officials, who were very helpful indeed. Within a matter of hours this person was able to enter South Africa. My point is that under such circumstances a criminal charge should not be laid against the company or the person concerned.</p>

<p>Another point I want to make is that &#x201C;conveyance&#x201D; is now very broadly defined in terms of a later provision in clause 13. It now includes &#x201C;all conveyances other than ships&#x201D;. What is the position in regard to persons bringing passengers into the country by car? They do not know about the visa requirements of South Africa, and in all innocence they may give somebody a lift across the border from Swaziland, Lesotho or some other country into South Africa. They too will then be covered by the provisions of this Act. Individuals are not aware of our visa requirements. I do not think there is a member in this House who knew that there were only four countries in the world in respect of which visas for South Africa are not required. I certainly did not know that Liechtenstein was one of those countries. Why Liechtenstein should fall into this category, I shall never know, and I am not even very interested. I am sure that nobody else in this House knew that the citizens of Liechtenstein do not require a visa for South Africa until the hon. member for Parow gave us the benefit of his wide acquaintance with visa requirements.</p>

<p>There is a third point I wish to make.</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. the Deputy Minister is making such a careful note of the points I am raising. I have personally lost count of thorn. There are cases where British subjects are in fact <i>personae non gratae</i> in South Africa. Some of them are informed of this before they even attempt a journey to South Africa, but some of them unfortunately arrive at Jan Smuts Airport not knowing that they are on a prohibited list. They are then told when they arrive that the exemption from visa requirements has been withdrawn in their case. Here the department cannot be so helpful because the withdrawal of such an exemption is carried out after an order from on high. Nobody ever knows from quite how high such an order comes, but there it is, and the department is not in a position to help. Would the hon. the Deputy Minister tell me how, if the person concerned does not even know that the exemption from visa requirements has been withdrawn in his case, the captain of a ship or an aircraft can possibly be expected to know that such a person is not allowed into the country without a visa or special permission? Some of these persons are, however, given special permits to visit for certain reasons. I know of cases where people have left South Africa on exit permits and have for compassionate reasons been allowed to return. In the other cases the aircraft or shipping company ought not to be subject to these criminal penalties because they cannot know that they have committed a crime, the &#x201C;knowing&#x201D; protection having been removed, the <i>mens rea.</i> I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will give this further consideration.</p>

<p>Apparently the hon. member for Houghton has more insight into these matters than does that hon. member; he does not know anything about the matter. The Act, as it reads at the moment, provides that a person cannot be held responsible if he commits an offence unwittingly. The amendment proposed by the hon. member for Green Point defeats the object of this amendment. I do not wish to argue with those hon. <span class="col_6763-6764" refersTo="page_0515"/>members, for they obviously do not see matters the way we do. But, in the first place, I nevertheless want to point out that the hon. member for Green Point has continually been harping on the point that we may as well allow a person to commit a theoretical offence. He agreed that the maximum penalty was not so unreasonable and that it was quite in line with the position in other countries. But, in any case, the maximum penalty need not be imposed. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Houghton accepts that, but not so the hon. member for Green Point. But, in any case, I do not want to discuss this matter with that hon. member, in his absence I said that he did not know anything about this matter. The point on which the hon. member kept harping, was that in this respect we might as well allow a person to commit a theoretical offence &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; whereas we do make provision for those cases to be dealt with by the officers. At any rate, the hon. member's argument is no argument. For instance, if I park here in Pie in Street, i.e, where I should not park, and I receive a parking ticket, I, too, will have committed an offence. What an absurd argument is it then for the hon. member to say that we are now making criminals of people. Surely, it is absurd to want to split hairs in regard to such a triviality.</p>

<p>What the hon. member for Houghton said, was quite correct&#x2014;the department goes out of its way to accommodate people who can prove their <i>bona fides</i>, as it did in the case she mentioned, although I still think that the company which brought that passenger into the country, ought to have known better and that people on the other side should have helped him. In any case, the department goes out of its way to accommodate these people; in fact, there is provision for it in the legislation. However, as the hon. the Deputy Minister said, these things are increasing; there has been a very substantial increase in the number of people who simply come here without the necessary travel documents, especially without visas. Of course, in many cases matters are arranged administratively, without any difficulty. But the hon. member also knows that in the past ugly incidents took place because people arrived here without the necessary travel documents. In such cases it is not the hon. member for Green Point and those hon. members who are held responsible, but in fact the hon. the Minister and the Government. Then they are saddled with the baby. It is easy for hon. members opposite to talk. They do not bear any responsibility and if unpleasant incidents do take place, incidents which can harm the good name of South Africa, they sit back and rejoice in them. I really think that hon. members should adopt a more considerate attitude. After all, the hon. member for Green Point is aware that such incidents do take place, and for that reason he ought to adopt a more responsible attitude. I do not know whether I should make the same appeal to the hon. member for Houghton as well.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>We are asking the hon. the Deputy Minister to apply the argument of the hon. member for Parow also to these cases.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister was good enough to point out that the question I raised was contained in section 20 as it is now. But section 20 (a) deals with the admission of a prohibited immigrant, with aiding or abetting a prohibited immigrant to enter the Republic. Well, I concede that the entry of a prohibited immigrant is a much more serious matter than the person whose travel documents are not in order. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows what is involved in the description &#x201C;prohibited immigrant&#x201D;, i.e. an unsavoury character whom we do not want in the country. Such a person and the one who assists him to come into the country, can only be convicted when it can be proved that he did so knowingly. But here we are concerned with an undocumented visitor and under <span class="col_6765-6766" refersTo="page_0516"/>the circumstances I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to reconsider what he said and to apply the same principle to this lesser offence, of bringing in an undocumented person. I have the suspicion at the back of my mind that there are some reasons for this, reasons which have as yet not been disclosed. Unless there is a very serious problem in some direction I cannot believe that a provision of this sort would be coming forward. There must be a very serious problem for a provision like this being introduced. If that is not so, and if it is only the isolated case that the Minister wants to deal with here, then he, even at this late stage, ought to agree that my amendment is a reasonable one.</p>

<p>I have listened to all the various arguments. As regards the hon. member for Green Point, he may accept that there is no hidden reason for this amendment, apart from those I have explained. As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s reference to &#x201C;prohibited person&#x201D;, he should look at section 24 (1) where a &#x201C;prohibited person&#x201D; is defined. A person without the necessary documents is in any case a prohibited person. It is therefore unnecessary to define it any further. The hon. member may accept that there are no reasons other than those I mentioned, which I am not going to deal with again since I have already done so.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Houghton mentioned a few problems which I consider to be exceptions to the rule. I said at the start that mostly people enter our country via these three ports and by way of boat or areoplane. The hon. member mentioned this problem of a stowaway. If a stowaway is found on board the public prosecutor will take into account the fact that the captain did not know about him, although he should have made sure from the list of reservations at the time of embarkation. If the captain did not know that this man was a prohibited immigrant, then I think no public prosecutor would have a case against him. The question is whether this man is a prohibited immigrant.</p>

<p>As far as clause 13 is concerned, the hon. member was worried about people coming into the country by means of all types of conveyance such as motor cars, not just by ship or aeroplane. I think it is very important that these people should know everything about the visa requirements. They at least should be aware of these requirements because we have a great deal of trouble with people coming by other means of conveyance and I am not very sympathetic towards these people. Then she raised the question of a person who is <i>persona non grata</i> and who has not been notified that his visa to enter South Africa is not longer in order. That may happen in exceptional cases. If a person like that enters the Republic not knowing that he is <i>persona non grata</i>, then I think he will have a very good case because the department will have defaulted, and in the second instance I do not know of any case where such a person has been convicted.</p>

<p>Sir, the concluding sentence of the hon. the Deputy Minister was &#x201C;in those cases I think we should leave it to the courts&#x201D;. Sir, that is exactly what we are asking on this side of the House: that is exactly what the amendment of the hon. member for Green Point means, that we should leave it to the courts <span class="col_6767-6768" refersTo="page_0517"/>to decide whether there was an intention to commit an offence on the part of the accused. But the amendment as it stands in the Bill today leaves no discretion to the court whatsoever. If evidence is brought that a person was introduced by an accused person, that is all that is required for a conviction. The court need not enter into the question of intention at all. The hon. the Deputy Minister in his first reply said himself that it is the intention of the department to remove the question of <i>mens rea.</i> That is exactly what he said, and what we are trying to do is to restore the discretion of the courts. We want the State to prove that the accused person introduced somebody knowing that he did not have the proper papers to be allowed into this country. Sir, I am afraid I cannot accept the argument of the hon. the Deputy Minister, He also said that the prosecutor, in the event of a captain of a Ship being charged with introducing a stowaway or allowing a stowaway to enter the Republic, would take into account the fact that he had no knowledge of the presence of the stowaway.

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>During the course of the Second Reading debate we raised the question of the words which appear in the English text, &#x201C;a juristic person&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister, as I understood him, said that what he had in mind in respect of a juristic person was anybody which had been established in terms of a statute. That is how I understood him. I have searched the Law Reports in vain for a definition of such a thing as &#x201C;a juristic person&#x201D;, as it is referred to here. One certainly could find out what is meant, but the difficulty one has is that a &#x201C;person&#x201D; is defined already in the Interpretation Act as follows. It says that when interpreting a statute &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Person&#x201D; includes any divisional council, municipal council, village management board or like authority, any company incorporated or registered as such under any law and any body of persons, corporate or unincorporate.</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;juristic&#x201D; would be unnecessary if the hon. the Minister wishes merely to deal with statutory bodies. If he wished to deal with statutory bodies, he ought to calf them statutory bodies, but he does not: he calls them &#x201C;a juristic person&#x201D;. It is a &#x201C;person&#x201D; as defined in the Interpretation Act which is apart from all those things set out, also &#x201C;juristic&#x201D;. Now this is an added complication and I feel it is unnecessary. But in any event it seems to me that, having regard to the definition of &#x201C;person&#x201D; in the Interpretation Act, this goes much further than the hon. the Deputy Minister wishes it to go. He does not want to take the power to expropriate on behalf of local authorities, for example. The expropriation provisions in the provinces deal with the question of expropriation by local authorities. So I am sure he does not mean that. But if &#x201C;person&#x201D; as defined in the Interpretation Act includes all these bodies like local authorities, bodies corporate and bodies unincorporate, then he is taking the power to deal with that situation as well. It is not that I am trying to be technical or difficult; it is a matter of having a power here to expropriate in respect of certain other persons than those for whom he may now expropriate. It is important to know what it is. I would suggest that the words &#x201C;juristic person&#x201D; should come out and &#x201C;a body corporate&#x201D; be put in, or if the hon. the Minister wishes, &#x201C;any body established under any law of the Republic&#x201D;, or something of that sort. But as it stands, it is complicated and will lead, I think, to difficulties. The hon. the Minister said yesterday that he was a practical man, and that was one of the ways in which he distinguished himself from me in this regard. But let me say that as a practical lawyer, words like this should be welcomed by all the lawyers. You know. Sir, Gilbert and Sullivan, in &#x201C;Trial by Jury&#x201D;, used the words &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am the Parliamentary draftsman,<br/>I make the country&#x2019;s laws;<br/>And of half the litigation<br/>I am undoubtedly the cause.</block>

<p>If I may say so, this is one such occasion where one might well have litigation to decide what on earth is meant by &#x201C;juristic person&#x201D;. I appeal earnestly to the hon. the Minister to take this word out and put in something which is known to the law, something which follows more closely what in fact is intended.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to cross swords with the hon. member on these points, since he has more experience of legal matters as an advocate. I want to say that I think the best in this case will be to ask our legal advisers to have another look at this clause. If they find that it should be altered, we can do it in the Senate. With regard to the juristic body we are referring to, I am glad that the hon. member mentioned the Interpretation Act. I was told that, according to the Interpretation Act, we have covered all the <span class="col_6771-6772" refersTo="page_0519"/>bodies for whom we are expropriating at the moment. Universities, technical colleges and the Atomic Energy Board are all covered by the expression &#x201C;juristic person&#x201D;. The hon. member suggests that we should rather refer to a body corporate or a body established by law. All statutory bodies are established by law. The main reason for this clause is that the Deciduous Fruit Board and the Potato Board need ground in order to experiment with virus free plant material, etc. I think, to save time, I will ask our legal advisers to consider whether we can alter the specific words for the benefit of the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We also indicated at the Second Reading that we did not like this provision. This clause now extends the jurisdiction of a magistrate&#x2019;s court in respect of expropriation proceedings from R3 000 to R10 000. No good reason has been given why this jurisdiction should be so increased. At the moment the jurisdiction of a magistrate&#x2019;s court in civil matters is RI 000. The hon. the Minister of Justice, who is present at the moment, knows that the jurisdiction was put up a few years ago from R200 to R1 000 and this was done for a very good reason. As the Expropriation Act stands at the moment, it is already three times that amount by way of jurisdiction. To extend it now to R10 000 is, in our opinion, without any justification at all. One of the reasons why the inferior courts have a limited jurisdiction is that some matters are so important that, in the first instance, they should be dealt with only by the persons of greater learning and experience, namely the Judges of the Supreme Court. That is the basic reason for the distinction in jurisdiction between the inferior and the superior courts.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister indicated yesterday that very few expropriation cases, in fact, went to court, as they were usually settled. As he says, the smaller cases of R2 000 and R3 000 are not cases which really concern the department. They are more concerned with the bigger cases. That is all the more reason, if I may say so, why the Supreme Court itself should retain jurisdiction over R3 000 with regard to these matters. As the hon. the Minister himself has indicated, the question of the expropriation of a man&#x2019;s land against his will, if he does not want to sell, is a very important and serious matter. We must bear in mind that this question does not only concern the compensation het gets, but also the mere fact that he is being deprived of his immovable property against his will. This is a matter one obviously feels very strongly about in one&#x2019;s heart as well as in one&#x2019;s pocket. Therefore, as a matter of public policy, I believe that it is important and necessary that the amount of compensation one gets with regard to expropriation should be determined, if possible, in all cases, only by the highest judicial officers in the land, namely the Judges. As I have said, we do not like this clause and, unless the hon. the Deputy Minister can give us some good reason why this should happen, and I do not include as a good reason the fact that the National Roads Act was amended the other day to give the magistrates&#x2019; courts jurisdiction up to R10 000 instead of R3 000, I am afraid we will have to oppose this measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would just like to support the general principle which the hon. member for Durban North has indicated, I do so partly now because the hon. Minister of Justice is present. I imagine that one of the reasons advanced for this provision is that it will save costs. Now, theoretically of course the magistrate&#x2019;s court is less expensive than the Supreme Court. That is the position theoretically. But as you raise the amounts in respect of cases that may be taken to the magistrates&#x2019; courts, as has been done here, so you will find that clients will insist upon having counsel as well as attorneys in those courts. It happens today in the case of large amounts. It is a perfectly sound idea to try to keep costs down to the minimum. With that I fully agree. But no one should think that because a matter is taken to the magistrates&#x2019; courts it would necessarily save costs. If you put up the amount of the jurisdiction of the magistrate&#x2019;s court sufficiently you will always get advocates briefed to go there which means a full team as you would have in the Supreme Court. I believe therefore that it is illusory that you can save costs by following this principle continuously. I therefore think that this supplements the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Durban North.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is an additional aspect, namely the question of time. My two colleagues have dealt with the principle of responsibility of the judicial officer and the question of the expense. There is also the question of time. It is very often thought that by giving jurisdiction to a magistrate, the case will be dealt with with greater efficacy and in a far shorter time than would be the case if it had to go to the Supreme Court. Now, with the shortage of manpower in the magistrates&#x2019; courts, and the constantly increasing jurisdiction which all sorts of statutes, two of which we dealt with this morning, give to the magistrate&#x2019;s court, you will find in many cases I think the lawyers will bear me out&#x2014;that to get a cause heard in a magistrate&#x2019;s court is slower, if anything, than the Supreme Court. The delays are just as great in the magistrates&#x2019; courts. So whether you look upon it from the point of view of delay or the point of view of responsibility and experience which my colleague from Durban North has dealt with or from the point of view of expense which the hon. member for Pinelands has dealt with, there is little to be said for giving a greatly enhanced jurisdiction to the magistrate&#x2019;s court as has been done in this instance.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I want to appeal to the hon. the Deputy Minister not to yield to the Opposition as regards this clause. The precedent exists in the present section of the Art that the normal amount of the magistrates&#x2019; courts may be exceeded, namely with R3 000 as against R1 000. What actually happens here is that to a certain extent only normal appreciation of land values is taken into account. If we take into consideration that the existing section was inserted in 1965 and that a great deal of the land that is expropriated is town land or land situated near urban development, I think that, by increasing the amount of R3 000 to R10 000 the normal appreciation of land during the past six year term has been taken into account to a large extent.</p>

<p>Moreover, I cannot agree with previous speakers that the cost aspect is not important. I think that in many cases it is a fact that the cost aspect is kept down by having the cases heard in magistrates&#x2019; courts. This is an important aspect, as is the time aspect. I cannot agree that it will not necessarily take longer if a case is heard by the Supreme Court. In most cases time is saved if the trial takes place in the magistrate&#x2019;s court. That is why I think this provision is a reasonable one, and I therefore ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to retain the proposed legislation as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat is a practising lawyer. Let me give a practical reason why this clause should not be passed in this form. Normally every claim in excess of R1 000 would go to the Supreme Court. If you had a claim of R9 000 then I think in almost every single case counsel would be employed. The attorney would instruct a barrister to appear in that matter because it is a matter of great importance. R9 000 is a lot of money. Our legal system recognizes that anything over R1 000 must be dealt with by a Judge. So you would employ counsel. Now, if you are the person whose land is being expropriated and you win your case &#x2014;you are awarded a sum of money in excess of that which has been offered you by the State. In addition you get an order of costs, i.e. that the other side will pay your costs. Your costs have to be paid by the Other side. But it is the taxed cons. It is not the costs that you incur in having to pay your attorney and barrister for their fees. Those you have to pay. You cannot get all that back. You can only get back the taxed costs on the magistrate&#x2019;s court scale. The taxed costs on the magistrate&#x2019;s court scale as opposed to costs on the Supreme Court scale are I suppose about one-sixth or one-fifth. I have not got the exact figures but the hon. gentleman who has just sat down will know. In other words you are only going to recover one-fifth of the actual costs that you have expended, having won your case, in order to get justice in the court, That is a practical reason why it is undesirable to extend the jurisdiction in these matters to R10 000. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister is now satisfied and that he will in effect withdraw the clause.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>This amendment is necessitated by the cost factor. We want to cover the public, the people whose land is being expropriated. The hon. member yesterday said that it was amended in 1968 from R1 000 to R3 000. It was actually in 1965, namely seven years ago. During that time <span class="col_6775-6776" refersTo="page_0521"/>the value of money deteriorated while land values appreciated. But if a man goes to the high court he needs two or three lawyers in most cases. It is more expensive. The hon. member mentioned the figure of R9 000. It is not about R9 000. Say, for instance, that we keep it at R3 000. We expropriate a person&#x2019;s plot worth R4 000. Let us say he is not satisfied. The argument will centre around R1 000 and not the R4 000 or R9 000. In most of these cases where amounts are small we come to an agreement. Sometimes we say: &#x201C;Come let us split the difference&#x201D; or might even say: &#x201C;Forget about it, it is only R500 extra, do not go to court.&#x201D; It is really the cases in excess of R10 000 that normally go to court. But now you want to force people where there are small differences in value to go to a high, court. The hon. member for Zululand said that cases are dealt with much faster in the high court than in the magistrate's court. Our experience is the direct opposite. Who will be more capable of making a decision, the local magistrate or the Judge in a high court without any experience of what is happening in the vicinity where we are expropriating? In practice it does not work that way.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked whether the Minister of Justice was satisfied. We had discussions with him. He said that to be practical in view of today&#x2019;s circimstances the amount ought to be altered from R3 000 to R10 000. The main purpose is to save the public&#x2019;s money.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, I am glad that the hon. member for Kroonstad as a lawyer says he feels we must not accept the suggestion that this proposal should be amended. The people must protect themselves. As I said, if there is a matter which concerns farmers, the farmers support one another. Now the attorneys and advocates are supporting each other. Hon. members on that side of the House must appreciate my argument too. We can argue about this matter for a very long time. The hon. member said that the provision in the National Roads Act in respect of the costs of such a case has been increased from R3 000 to R10000. This is no argument. The same argument which applied to the amendment or the National Roads Act applies here as well This Parliament accepted the provision as such. If land is expropriated today for the purpose of building a road there, one is not going to argue about R500. We pay the amount which the owner of the land wants. In most cases we give him an extra R20 for the inconvenience suffered by him. The hon. member must therefore forgive me if I do not grant his request.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill contains proposed amendments which have, in the course of time, become necessary.</p>

<p>I Firstly, the existing definition of &#x201C;department&#x201D;, which in some respects is unsatisfactory, is being amended by clause I(a) of the draft Bill. In the existing definition a bureau of the Government, an office of the Government are referred to without making it clear that the bureau is also a department of State. In addition, the use of the words &#x201C;department of State&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;department of the Government&#x201D; adapts the language to the language of section 20 of our Constitution Act. In the existing definition a department is defined as a department which is already mentioned in the Schedule to the Act, i.e. a department which has already been established. In terms of section 6 (2) (a) of the Public Service Act, however, the recommendation of the Commission is required for the establishment of a department which is intended to be mentioned in the Schedule&#x2014;at least, that was the intention. The proposed definition in clause 1 (a) makes this intention clearer. The words &#x201C;provincial or other administration of the Government referred to&#x201D; have already given rise to misunderstanding and the words &#x201C;including a provincial administration or the administration of the territory&#x201D; are being substituted. This amendment makes it clearer that the definition of &#x201C;department&#x201D; is being expanded to include as well the administrations which are not normally departments.</p>

<p>2. Clause 1 (b) makes provision for the insertion of the definition of &#x201C;non-White authority&#x201D;. The degree and form of self <span class="col_6777-6778" refersTo="page_0522"/>government of the non-White population groups differ, and so, too, do the bodies in authority, A definition which includes all these bodies is deemed to be necessary.</p>

<p>3. In view of the success which has already been achieved with the permanent appointment of married women and the retention in service of female staff in a permanent capacity after they had married, viz. the fact that the staff position had improved considerably as a result of that, the Public Service Commission concluded that it could to good effect delegate to departments the power conferred upon it by the Public Service Act in regard to the permanent appointment/permanent retention after marriage of female staff&#x2014;as it has already done in respect of a number of its other powers. Such a step would eliminate delay and promote efficiency.</p>

<p>Section 14 (7) of the Public Service Act provides as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A female officer (other than a member of the Services) who marries shall be deemed to have retired voluntarily from the public service in contemplation of marriage with effect from the date of her marriage, or if she has discharged her duties on that day, with effect from the day following the date of her marriage, unless the Commission recommends and the Minister or Administrator approves that she be retained in the public service.</block>

<p>However, section 5 (3) of the Public Service Act provides that the Commission may not delegate the powers conferred upon it, <i>inter alia</i>, by section 14 (7) of the Act. With a view to the necessity for the optimum utilization of trained and experienced manpower at this present juncture, and in order to ensure that decisions concerning the permanent appointment of married women /retention in service after marriage of female officers can he taken without delay, the removal of the said restriction is in every way justified.</p>

<p>Clause 2 makes provision for this.</p>

<p>4. As far as clause 3 is concerned, the Public Service Commission is not in terms of the provisions of the said sections of the principal Act required to have its annual report, which covers the period 1st January to 31st December, ready for tabling during the ensuing parliamentary session. However, it is deemed advisable that Parliament should be informed about the functions of the Commission and the staff position in the public service as early as possible. The office of the Commission is to a large extent dependent upon departments for supplying the statistics which are required for drawing up the report, precisely at that time of the year which is the busiest. Difficulty is continually experienced therefore with the finalization and printing of the report before the end of the ensuing session of Parliament. If the report year were to end on 30th June, it would not only reduce the pressure on departments, but would also reflect the staff position more accurately, which undergoes its greatest fluctuation during the period December to February. The intention is to cover a period of 18 months in the first report which will he drawn up after the statutory amendment has been passed.</p>

<p>5. (i) Clause 4 (a) amends the Act by the insertion of a subsection 5A through which provision is being made for the employment by departments of State of persons in the service of other governments, a non-White authority, hoard, etc. The recommendation of the Commission is stated to be a requirement here and the employment takes place on the conditions (excluding conditions laid down by or under a pension law) as may be approved by the Treasury on the recommendation of the Commission. This subsection is worded to cover all possible cases of secondment to the Public Service and not only Bantu in the employ of non-White authorities. It is felt that the conditions under which the employment takes place should be recommended by the Commission to preclude a seconded person retaining conditions of service which may differ fundamentally from those of his co-workers.</p>

<p>(ii) Clause 4 (to) makes provision for the transfer of non-White officers and employees in the public service to the service of non-White authorities. The intention is that with the establishment of &#x201C;public services&#x201D; of their own for the territorial authorities, all the Bantu staff at present in the service of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education, to whom functions have been entrusted, shall be transferred to the &#x201C;public service&#x201D; of their national unit in question with all the accompanying privileges, such as salary scales, conditions of service, pensions, etc., according to their own circumstances.</p>

<p>However, the two Republican departments will still have to make use of the services <span class="col_6779-6780" refersTo="page_0523"/>of Bantu officers in White rural and urban areas and it may sometimes be necessary for such Bantu officers to be seconded from the establishments of the Bantu territorial authorities in question to the two Republican departments in question, which will also in such cases be responsible: for the remuneration of the Bantu official in question.</p>

<p>The concluding remarks of the hon. the Minister made it quite clear that this Bill really belongs to the sphere of influence of the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. When one examines this Bill from the point of view of the administration of the Public Service only clauses 1 (a), the definition of &#x201C;department", clause 2, dealing with delegated authority in regard to women marrying when in service and clause 3 dealing with the annual report, have reference to normal Public Service Commission activities. Basically the provisions of these three clauses are unobjectionable and there are good reasons for their acceptance.</p>

<p>But when one strips the Bill of this superficial veneer then one sees what is in reality the main principle of this measure. This then takes us once more into the realms of fantasy of this Government and its Bantu policy. These provisions can only be understood by those who accept the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate sovereign independent states.</p>

<p>To prove my statement let us examine the Bill. The definition of &#x201C;non-White authority&#x2019;&#x2019; needs some analysis. This definition now creates some five types of non-White authorities. The first three of these can be created under existing Bantu laws; under the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951; under the Development of Self-government for Native Nations in South-West Africa Act of 1968, and finally under the Bantu Homeland" Constitution Act of 1971. In view of these definitions, which Minister or ministry is primarily concerned with this legislation? I am sorry to see that neither the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration nor the hon. the Deputy Minister is present. in view of the fact that this is of such paramount importance for their departments. The fourth type of authority is an interesting one, i.e. the &#x201C;Government of a territory which has been or is declared by or under an Act of Parliament to be a self-governing territory within the Republic&#x201D; without it having any relation with the concept of sovereign independent states. The final authority introduces another interesting facet of thinking in an effort to tidy up the Public Service Commission in relation to Government policy, i.e. an institution or body with executive authority in respect of a specific non-White population group. I hope hon. members realize that we are not here dealing with any of the concepts of nationhood in so far as this authority is concerned.</p>

<p>Under the definition we now cover the whole spectrum of the race policies of the Government. We cover the spectrum of the various types of authorities so far as the Bantu peoples are concerned; we cover the idea of the separate nationhood of the South-West African non-White people; we cover the self-governing authorities within the territory of the Republic, and we finally come to authorities with executive powers over their own population groups. Sir, we on this side of the House would support communal councils with executive authority over their own population groups within the Republic; we accept it as part of our policy, and we realize that such communal councils exercising executive authority over matters which are of particular concern to their particular population group, would require a staff of civil servants to be available to them. But, Sir, we do not believe that the control can be divorced entirely from the Public Service Commission of the Republic. But, Sir, that is Government policy, and primarily this Bill has reference to the establishment of sovereign independent Bantu homelands. Is this reality? Let us turn to clause 4 of this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Here we have the subterfuge of the hon. the Minister of the Interior introducing a measure; I do not say that it is a deliberate subterfuge, but the calmness with which it is introduced creates the impression that it is just a little matter of dealing with foreign governments when we know what &#x201C;foreign governments&#x201D; mean to that side of the House. But, Sir, I must not be led astray by the hon. member for Potchefstroom Sir, at first glance clause 4 would appear to have some merit, if one looks at it from the point of view of the employment, on secondment, by our Public Service Commission of officials from other governments, in other words, officials seconded to the Republic. <span class="col_6781-6782" refersTo="page_0524"/>One can recall practices of that nature in the past which have been of tremendous value to South Africa. One thinks of the years gone by when there was a teacher exchange system between South Africa and other countries, where teachers from South Africa were seconded to overseas countries and teachers from overseas, specialists in various aspects, were brought to South Africa. That system has merit and I agree that in so far as it was used at that time, it was a practical and useful practice, but that type of thing has been dropped by this Government. The secondment here is the secondment of a Xhosa from the Transkei Territorial Authority to come and do a job in Langa or Soweto or Guguletu. That is the secondment which is envisaged in this clause of the Bill.</p>

<p>The second portion of clause 4 deals with the transfer of persons to the service of a non-White authority. Those persons are trained here and they are then transferred to the Civil Service of the territory. And to that extent it has a certain amount of merit. But, Sir, when one examines these provisions in the light of the Government&#x2019;s political thinking, then one finds that this Bill before us has many objectionable aspects. Sir, the new subsection (5A) in effect extends section 13 of the principal Act which provides for secondment out of the Republic, subject to certain protections as to salary and grade. At the moment, Sir, as you will be aware, secondment out of the Public Service of the Republic requires the consent of the individual concerned, and on transfer from one department to another there are statutory protections as to his grade and remuneration. Sir, this is done and it has been correctly done by us in the past. We have seconded South African civil servants to neighbouring countries to assist those countries in various technical capacities. One sees in the last available report of the Public Service Commission that an organizer of training in the Civil Service was seconded from our Public Service to the Public Service of Malawi; that is secondment out of the country. As far as the secondment of officials from other countries to our Public Service is concerned we have no difficulties; they come to this country and they are employed under the laws as they now stand cm a temporary or a special appointment basis while they are working in South Africa. We do not need this new subsection (5A) to enable us to take into our employment <i>bona fide</i> officials from foreign governments because they are employed here now for specific purposes. People are brought to this country to assist in research of a certain nature and there is no difficulty in employing those persons here temporarily, so one must ask oneself why this provision in the Bill is necessary. It becomes necessary, Sir, solely because of the introduction into this Bill of a non-White authority and because this is to apply to secondment of persons from a non-White authority to the Public Service of the Republic, It is not necessary, in the case of a pucea foreign country, to have this provision in our law at all.</p>

<p>That clause therefore is not necessary, but it only becomes necessary with reference to non-White authorities, because these authorities at present are part and parcel of the body politic of South Africa; they are not foreign. The Bantu authorities at the present time are not sovereign independent authorities; they are part and parcel of the body politic of South Africa, and just as the Public Service Commission controls a vast strata of officials employed by the provincial councils, it would remain the duty of the Public Service Commission to control the Public Service, While or non-White, of a Bantu authority, unless special legislation was passed to vary that provision. Sir, what the Government is trying to create in this Bill is the status and the aura of foreign authorities, of foreign governments, in the minds of members of this House for a constitutional fact that does not exist, in other words the creation of a fiction of foreigness and independence so far as these non-White authorities are concerned. Sir, that is a fiction because it is not a constitutional fact, and that is the very purpose of this clause which is now being brought in to deal with foreign authorities.</p>

<p>If the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration were here I would remind him that what we are trying to do is to create what he always terms a <i>de jure</i> position out of a <i>de facto</i> situation. That is what we are trying to do now by this particular legislation. Sir, when one looks at clause 4 (b) which contains, the new subsection (7), one finds that it is a most interesting clause. First of all, it negates the safeguard in regard to non-Whites which exist at the present moment, in section 13 as regards consent by an official before he is seconded. This clause provides that a non-White officer or employee may be transferred, on the recommendation of the commission, to the service of a non-White <span class="col_6783-6784" refersTo="page_0525"/>authority on such conditions as may be prescribed on the recommendation of the commission. Sir, why are these non-White employees not to have the protection which is afforded to every other public servant? If one reads section 13 of that Act, one finds there that a secondment can only take place with the consent of the public servant concerned. This is an intrusion against the basic protection of a public servant of the Government of the Republic of South Africa. These people can now be transferred willy-nilly without their consent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>That is so. Sir, whenever the hon. member for Brakpan finds himself not quite understanding what is going on, he says that it is nonsense. Let me take the hon. member through this quietly and calmly. If the hon. member will look at section 13 of the principal Act he will find that under the principal Act there can be no secondment without consent. There can be a transfer from one department to another but there can be no secondment. I will read to the hon. member section 13 (6)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An officer may with his own consent and on the recommendation of the commission and upon such conditions as may be recommended by it in consultation with the Treasury be seconded &#x2026; to the service of any other Government or to a board &#x2026;</block>

<p>It is with his consent. I hope the honourable and enlightened member for Brakpan will show me where the consent of a non-White officer or employee is required under this new subsection (7). A civil servant can be transferred at the present time from one department to another, but not outside to another Government without his consent, subject to safeguards as regards pay under section 13 of the principal Act. But this clause in the Bill can create a new concept of transfer, because this is a transfer not within the Public Service Commission, or within the orbit of influence of the Public Service Commission, but it is out of the Public Service into the service of a foreign authority, with its own public service, and there are no safeguards whatsoever in so far as that person is concerned. He is transferred on the basis on which the Commission decides, not the basis that that particular employee or official of the Public Service is prepared to accept. If one goes further and looks at the proviso, the provios is worthless. The provios says that until any law in force within the territory of the non-White authority provides otherwise&#x2014; that is, until the law of the new controlling authority provides otherwise&#x2014;he shall he protected as regards leave and pension rights. In other words, the non-White public servant who is in the employ of the Public Service Commission of the Republic of South Africa can be transferred to the Public Service Commission of the Transkei, and he immediately becomes subject to whatever provisions may there be imposed by the Public Service Commission of the Transkei. He no longer has the protection and the safeguards which he enjoys at present as an employee of the Republic.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say that I find some saving grace in this Bill. These things can happen to these persons, but I think we should have no fear that that fate will befall the non-White officers and employees of the Public Service of South Africa at the present time, because they must be retained; their services are required in the Republic of South Africa in the jobs which they are doing at present. Paragraph (b), I feel sure, will not be applied to a single non-White official or employee of the Public Service without simultaneous application of paragraph (a), and that is that the official becomes seconded back to the Public Service of the Republic of South Africa simultaneously. This fits in with the fictional thinking of the Government. Let us say a teacher, who is working for the Bantu Education Department, and who is teaching in a school in Guguletu in the Cape and now falls under the control of the Public Service Commission, is a Xhosa. Under the fictional thinking of the Government he is a citizen of the Transkei. He is also a citizen and a national of the Republic, but he is a citizen of the Transkei. So that Bantu is now transferred without his consent. He is put on the list of the Civil Service of the Transkei, and simultaneously he is brought back into the service of the Republic of South Africa on secondment. The Bantu does not move. He does not leave his job. He does not have to move out of his house, and he does not have to miss one class. But in the process of that, the fictional thinking of the Government has now been achieved, and this main is now I an employee of the Transkei; he is now <span class="col_6785-6786" refersTo="page_0526"/>a public servant of the Transkei seconded to the Republic of South Africa to serve the Xhosas in Guguletu. He is no longer a problem of ours, and he is removed from the Public Service list of South Africa. He is a seconded official from a foreign state. It is very interesting when one thinks of this process taking place, because when one looks at the question of secondment and transfer to these non-White authorities, according to the report of the Public Service Commission on 31st December, 1969, non-Whites under the control of the Public Service Commission totalled 66 905 and they represented 42 per cent of the total number of officials and employees under the control of the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>Now I can appreciate that any Nationalist purist will consider that it is a blatant example of integration that 42 per cent of the Public Service of South Africa, under the control of our Public Service Commission, should be non-White. It spoils the whole illusion of separateness; it is too factual, and it is for this reason only that this type of legislation is being brought into this House. These provisions of clause 4 can and will in practice provide that by a bookkeeping entry, a journal entry, or a re-sorting of the computer cards in the computer of the Public Service Commission, all non-White civil servants will disappear or can disappear. They can go to the authority which looks after the Cape Coloureds. They can be transferred to the authority looking after the nations of South-West Africa. They can be removed from the records and there will remain a nominal roll of the Public Service of South Africa, which is pure, unsullied and White. But 42 per cent of that Civil Service will in fact remain non-White, working in South Africa and doing the same jobs without having being disrupted for one moment of their time and their work. The Xhosa teacher at Langa, the Zulu clerk in Durban, and the Shangaan on one of the ships&#x2014; and will the hon. member for Potchefstroom take note that this applies also to the services&#x2014;will <i>de jure</i> no longer be employed by the South African Republican Civil Service but <i>de facto</i> they will carry on doing the jobs which they have been doing the whole time. And to achieve this happy result, the Deputy Minister will be plaguing&#x2014;I am glad to see the Deputy Minister is here&#x2014;the Minister of the Interior that he and his Commission should create these departments and see to it that these transfers take place, and that on paper the Civil Service of die separate non-White authorities is established, with their whole staff seconded back to the Republic of South Africa. Sir, we cannot support this measure and will vote against it.</p>

<p>After having listened to the hon. member for Green Point one is at first inclined to think that he said such a great deal and yet said nothing. But I do not want to say that of the hon. member. I think that if one analyses very accurately what he said this morning, it is really frightening&#x2014;and I shall return to this again in the second half of my speech&#x2014;when one realizes what the Opposition actually have in mind by opposing this Bill in principle. I found it amazing that, although certain amendments are being made to the original Act in this Bill, the hon. member actually had so little to say about clauses 2 and 3. That is to my mind proof that the moment one discusses the Bantu and the solution to our problems there, these hon. members simply become blind to all the other assets which are after all included in this Bill.</p>

<p>The fact that a change is being effected in clause 2 of the Bill in respect of the delegation of powers of the Public Service Commission to others, is very important, and I think the hon. member ought to have discussed it, and I hope other hon. members will. It proves once again the importance this side of the House attaches to the Public Service in our society. I have mentioned previously in this House, and I want to mention it again, that in 1965 the late Dr. Verwoerd replied at Loskop Dam to the question of how the White civilization in South Africa could survive. One of his reasons was the presence of a sound Public Service. I think that hon. members on the opposite side do not want to appreciate sufficiently the value of our Public Servants, particularly in respect of these changes in which die emphasis is being placed on the role of the women in our Public Service. One ought on this occasion, where the emphasis falls on the women, to express a word of gratitude in respect of the role women have played in our Public Service and the increasing importance of the role which they will still have <span class="col_6787-6788" refersTo="page_0527"/>to play in future. I want to slate this morning that in Pretoria in particular, where the Public Service is concentrated, the inhabitants of Pretoria are beginning to realize the role which women play there without neglecting their normal functions. That is why I think this change is important. It will make the Public Service far more streamlined, and it will make the functioning of our Public Service far more efficient if a woman, when she marries, does not automatically lose her permanent role.</p>

<p>I should like to dwell for a few moments on the argument raised here by the hon. member for Green Point in regard to the proposed sections 3 and 4, Once again the hon. member immediately wanted to drag in Bantu Administration in this connection to play a little politics in regard to their solution to our racial and population problem in South Africa. It is very interesting to observe what the views of the hon. members of the Opposition are on the Public Service in South Africa, particularly in relation to the race problem we have in South Africa. In this connection the National Party adopts the premise that since there is a variety of different kinds of peoples one can only find a solution to this matter with a policy of separate development. Because the Opposition does not view the problem in this light, the hon. member for Green Point attacks us when we want to adopt the course of principles, which the National Party adopted a long time ago, in regard to the development and progress of the non-Whites in our State administration as well. The United Party really sees South Africa, and therefore the Public Service and also the functioning of the Public Service Commission, as an integrated unit. In other words, they see it as a unit in our State administration in regard to which there is no distinction between race and people. That was what the basic attack which the hon. member for Green Point made on us consisted of, when he referred in certain terms to this legislation. During his entire discussion this morning the hon. member for Green Point did not really say anything about the nature of the role of the non-Whites in our State administration at the moment, and what it should be in future in terms of their policy. That is the gist, the crux of our discussion. He advanced many minor arguments which were very superficial, hut the hon. member and the speakers who are going to follow him, must deal with this fundamental point and tell us what role the non-Whites are going to play in the State administration in terms of their policy. The hon. member said that they accept that the non-Whites must perform certain work on a provincial level. However, that was never their policy in the past. Their policy was only published in the yellow booklet because the National Party forced them at that stage to accept our policy. It is very easy now for the hon. member to say: &#x201C;We are going to deal with the non-Whites up to that level&#x201D;. But the hon. member and the speakers who are going to follow him, must go further. They most tell us what the role of the non- Whites is going to be in the whole central organization of our State administration.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about &#x201C;the realms of fantasy&#x201D;. It was he who began this discussion of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. That is why the hon. member asked: &#x201C;Where is the Minister then?&#x201D;. Does the hon. member think that the Minister of the Interior would have introduced such a Bill without having held thorough consultations in advance with the other Ministers and departments involved in this matter? Sir, I want to tell you that this Bill is clearly in line with the solution which the National Party offers for our racial and population situation. In that respect I agree with the hon. member, for the National Party does not do a thing like this without its being based on principles and without bearing in mind the ultimate ideals we cherish for our country. These amendments to the legislation are rendering a service to the Bantu. They bring to those Bantu who want to make a career of State administration all the benefits which the present Public Service Commission brings to White officials, benefits which we find in State administrations throughout the entire Western world. In other words, for virtually the first time in the history of Africa the Bantu of South Africa are now being afforded an opportunity of being introduced, on the soundest basis, to State administration in the Western world. It is therefore an important aspect we are dealing with here. Sir having now mentioned this general principle. I must point out that all the study material, all the methods and all the organization which is already being supplied by the Public Service Commission within the White State administration is now going to be supplied in a much more effective way to the Bantu. This is also in <span class="col_6789-6790" refersTo="page_0528"/>line with the National Party policy of trusteeship, in terms of which we want to lead these people to a specified point. Another important aspect is that, with this amendment, the Bantu are also being afforded an opportunity to develop leadership talents in respect of this facet of State administration. This is a very important matter, and we are doing it in such a way that no ceiling will be established for these Bantu in the State administration. That is precisely what would happen under the policy of that side of the House.</p>

<p>Through these amendments the Bantu are being offered a greater variety of work opportunities. Just think how many possible occupations there are for any White person in the State machinery. Now we are establishing all the possible occupations which exist for the Whites for the Bantu as well in their various ethnic units. A world of possible occupations is now being opened to the Bantu. That choice is so tremendous, so phenomenal and so far-reaching that we will in this way promote stability in the future development of the various Bantu groups. In other words, this Bill brings greater benefits not only to the individual Bantu, but also to the various Bantu communities.</p>

<p>Another very important point is that it will also relieve the pressure on our White labour. At present there are many Whites who have for many years been performing certain duties very efficiently for the Bantu. Now we will have an opportunity to replace many of those Whites with Bantu and to use them in an effective way in the White State administration. In other words, it will also to a certain extent be possible to alleviate the shortage in our own Public Service. We are rendering a service to the general South African community, in that we are in this way eliminating unnecessary points of friction.</p>

<p>Another important point is that this Bill is based on the principle of trusteeship in respect of the Bantu. This is a policy which will lead to the independence of the various Bantu groups, in contrast to the policy which the hon. member for Green Point nurtures in his bosom, but does not state, namely a policy of White domination which is in the long run going to force them under pressure to allow integration, or a policy of White domination which in this country will lead to a revolution. That hon. member can laugh about it now, but he shall have to ponder very thoroughly what his ideals in respect of this matter are.</p>

<p>There is another point I want to raise. The hon. member is tremendously opposed to this legislation now. But what is the position at the moment in respect of Swaziland, Lesotho and Botswana? Do we not find that some of our White public servants are being transferred to those countries to give assistance there? Are not our own Bantu then in a far more privileged position, because we are making our White officials available to them from the very outset? From that it also follows that as these people fill their own Public Service vacancies, they will to a far greater extent be able to serve their own people. With retrospect effect we will also find that if there are a large number of Zulu, Xhosa or Venda who as a result of the circumstances of their work have to remain within the White areas, some of those people will then be able to go from here to serve their own people, as could also theoretically be the case in regard to a large number of Malawians or Swazis who are working here.</p>

<p>By way of summary I want to say that the National Party is, with these amendments, continuing to ensure that the State machinery in our country functions smoothly and efficiently. We are also establishing a Public Service among the non-White peoples and are training public servants that will, in the most efficient way possible, be of assistance to the Government of those areas&#x2014;to whatever stage they may have developed&#x2014;as well as to the individuals of those communities.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Rissik started by criticizing the hon. member for Green Point for not having addressed the House on clauses 1, 2 and 3 of this Bill. I do not know what more the hon. member wanted. The hon. member for Green Point said that we supported those clauses. If we are in agreement with those clauses, must we make a long speech about them? After all, they are very simple clauses. There is nothing to them. What the hon. member for Rissik wanted the hon. member for Green Point to do, was to thank the women for what they do for the Service. But the women know that on this side of the House we have the champions of the women who have always fought for the rights of the women and for the advancement of women. <span class="col_6791-6792" refersTo="page_0529"/>It is not necessary for this side of the House to assure the women that we have their interests at heart. But it does become necessary for that side of the House to do it every now and then.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik must be very naive or he must think that we are. He asked us whether we do not think that there is the closest consultation with the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Does the hon. member want this side of the House, or the country, or even his own colleagues to believe that the hon. the Minister of the Interior is responsible for this clause? How did this clause get in this Bill? There sits one of the instigators, the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education. I use the word instigator, because this does not affect the security of the State. I use it in regard to the change of this legislation. The other one &#x2026;</p>

It is quite obvious that this amendment is being made at the request of the Bantu Affairs Department and nobody else. I bet the hon. the Minister of the Interior never thought of this. In discussing another Bantu Bill the other day, I said that the only good point I could see in the Bill was that we were probably coming to the end of Bantu legislation, because the department had taken over so much power that there was nothing else they could do. But how wrong I was! The initiative and ingenuity of this department amaze us. They are always thinking of something else.</p>

But they are of no importance, because only the Bantu have been referred to by the speakers on that side of the House.

Once this Bill is passed, we will find that as either the lesser authorities are established under the Bantu Authorities Act or <span class="col_6793-6794" refersTo="page_0530"/>the major authorities or governments under the Bantu Homelands Act or other Acts under which these authorities are established, the Bantu civil servants in the White areas will be transferred to these authorities.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister will reply to this debate and he can then deal with this matter. As these authorities are established, so the Bantu civil servants in the White areas will he transferred to those authorities, although not physically. They will remain here and do what they are doing now. Consequently, their transfer will only be a journal entry, a figure in different books. Otherwise nothing will change, not for the time being at any rate. All Bantu civil servants are classified as belonging to one population group or another; they are citizens of some or other fictitious state and have dual citizenship. It is quite easy to transfer them now, say to the Transkei, the Ciskei or the Zululand Bantu Authority and as those authorities get their own civil service these Bantu civil servants at present serving in the White areas will be transferred to those territorial authorities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik said we ought to accept this as offering real opportunities for the Bantu. But what opportunities are being offered? They will still be doing the same work, whether as teachers or in any other job. All that is being done is that they are being transferred on paper. But should there be such wonderful opportunities as the hon. member says, why is it necessary to bring in this legislation? Surely, if the opportunities in the Bantu homelands are so wonderful, these Bantu civil servants would of their own accord apply to be transferred there; they would not have to be transferred against their will and without their consent. This is what is going to happen now&#x2014;they are not going to have any choice.</p>

<p>I think this situation is unique anywhere in the world, where a Government goes out of its way to pass special legislation enabling it to transfer civil servants willy-nilly to some other Government, willy-nilly and without giving them protection. Because what protection are they going to get? The proviso to this clause means nothing. They will only be protected till the Authority to which they are transferred passes its own laws in regard to salaries, pension rights and that sort of thing. Is that the way to treat civil servants? When the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration transferred certain servants recently he did not do this type of thing, but went out of his way to protect them.</p>

<p>Because the Transkei Government did not reduce their conditions of service it does not mean that they may not still do that in future.

Why did he have special provisions in that Bill to protect them? The hon. the Deputy Minister will remember that (hat matter was discussed here at some length and that he even accepted amendments. As a matter of fact, he went out of his way to ensure that those administration servants were protected. That Bill provided that the Minister could take over Bantu administration of the Bantu townships from local authorities. Obviously he needed staff to do that and, consequently, provided that the present staff of the local authorities would be seconded to him for six months, within which period he would have to make an otter to those officials.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make, Sir, is that a similar provision ought to be inserted in this Bill as well. Our point is that under this Bill civil servants are not being protected. What we would like to see is the inclusion in this Bill of provisions similar to those of the Bantu Affairs Administration Bill. I referred to that Bill as an example of how civil servants ought to be treated when transferred from one authority to another. In terms of the existing Act a civil servant cannot be transferred from one department to another unless he is transferred at the same salary or for more, but he cannot be transferred at a lesser salary. In this Bill before us no such protection is being given. Servants can be transferred from one service to another without any protection whatsoever.</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing with the terms of employment of the officials who will be transferred from the Civil Service of our Government to the civil services of the different Bantu authorities and bodies, and I pointed out that in terms of this Bill before us there was no protection given to them. In fact, they are not given the protection that is given to other public servants under our Public Service Act, which we are now amending, or under the Bantu Affairs Administration Act, where servants are transferred from one body to another. In all those instances their rights are protected and I submit that in this case their rights are not protected. Sir, the point is this: They can be transferred without their consent to another service. This is all part of the ideological plan of the Government. The illusion is created that there are going to be no Bantu in the White areas and that the Bantu we see there are in fact not there. We will again have the argument from the hon. the Deputy Minister about the <i>de facto</i> position and the <i>de jure</i> position. I see he nods his head. He is working it out.</p>

Under this Bill they will continue to work here on the same conditions until the Transkei Government passes another law. So the question is whether they are here <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto.</i> This Bill, Sir, is a paper apartheid.

The hon. member for Rissik mentioned integration. Surely I am entitled to deal with this question of integration in the Civil Service. The fact is that there is more and more integration, not only economic integration, but also integration in the Government service, every day in the White areas and that is what the hon. member for Rissik referred to. He said that we wanted to continue this integration, while they wanted the separation to be complete, and that that was the difference between our two parties. Sir, I submit that merely to put them down on paper as servants of another government seconded to us does not end integration. They are still here in our Civil Service.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik said that this would relieve the shortage of White civil servants. I see him nodding his head. That is what he said. I submit that that is not true. They will not help to relieve the shortage of White civil servants, because they will continue to do the same work that they are doing at present. The White civil servants working in the Transkei, the Ciskei, in Zululand or wherever they may be, will still continue to work there because they are seconded to those authorities. That has nothing to do with the provisions of this Bill. This Bill does not provide for White officials. It only affects the Bantu, the Coloured and the Indian civil servants. It is therefore not going to relieve the shortage of White civil servants. I submit that this Bill is not going to relieve any situation. It is not going to solve any of our problems, and that is why I called it &#x201C;paper apartheid&#x201D;. It is just an illusion to pretend that these people are not here.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it has been a long time I last heard the hon. member for Transkei discuss a matter and, in my humble opinion, flounder about to such an extent as he did this afternoon. I shall i v to prove that statement. He said, in the first place, that this Bill was an example of &#x201C;paper apartheid&#x201D;. Allow me to mention to that hon. member, as example, what Prof. Ntsanwise, at present chief councillor and if the legislation in question is made applicable to them, also Prime Minister of the Shangaan people in the Northern Transvaal, told the Dutch public when he and Dr. Van Zyl, the Secretary for Bantu Education, recently visited the Netherlands. When Dr. Van Zyl put the policy of apartheid to the Dutch, there was still a measure of doubt. Questions were asked, etc. Then Prof. Ntsanwise stood up and said that he and Dr. Van <span class="col_6799-6800" refersTo="page_0533"/>Zyl had grown up on the same farm and that they had played together as children, amongst other things with knuckle bones, etc. He also told how there had been a secret rivalry between them. Dr. Van Zyl attended his school, and Prof. Ntsanwise attended another school. Dr. Van Zyl made progress, and subsequently became a teacher. A long time after that Ntsanwise also became a teacher, but when he became a teacher, Dr. Van Zyl had already been promoted further. He was at that time already deputy secretary of the Department of Bantu Education.</p>

<p>Prof. Ntsanwise then told the Dutch public that he had thought that he would never again be able to catch up with Dr. Van Zyl, But then, as a result of the fact that this Government established their own Bantu university for them, he succeeded in becoming professor at Turfloop. But even then he was still far behind Dr. Van Zyl. [Interjection,] Just allow me to make my point please. You spoke about paper apartheid. Prof. Ntsanwise went on to tell the Dutchmen that Dr. Van Zyl subsequently became Secretary of the Department. Again he. Prof. Ntsanwise, thought that he would never be able to catch up with Dr. Van Zyl. But, as he related: &#x2018;&#x2018;Then we got our own Government. My people had to elect a Prime Minister, and they elected me as Prime Minister. Then I had passed Dr. Van Zyl, because Dr. Van Zyl will never be able to become Prime Minister of his people!&#x201D; [Interjections.] Is that paper apartheid? Sir, now they are laughing at this. I want to inform those hon. members that that story Prof. Ntsanwise told made a great impression on the Dutch audience, Sir, the ignorance which exists on that side of the House in regard to the application of this policy of multi-national development, can sometimes be abysmal. We shall have to do something to enable those members to go and have a look for themselves at what progress is being made in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>That hon. member has now asked what new opportunities this Bill will offer the Bantu Public Servants, He said: &#x201C;They will do the same work. They will only be transferred to the Bantu homeland Government and their own civil services.&#x201D; But surely it is the most blatant ignorance to talk like that, and for this simple reason. Does the hon. member for Transkei not know that in the Transkei, as long ago as 1963, officials like these were transferred to the establishment of the Transkeian Government, that this has been the position for eight years now and that it is a brilliant success, and does he not know that in the Transkei there are already two Bantu magistrates with an entirely Bantu staff, and that a third is shortly to be appointed? [Interjections.] Surely a magistrate is a public servant. He said: &#x201C;There will be no new opportunities.&#x201D; Would the hon. member tell us whether he thinks a Bantu can become a magistrate in White South Africa? But in the Transkei there are already two, with their entire staff, and a third is to be appointed next month. As they become capable of occupying those positions, they are appointed to them. But the hon. member asked what new opportunities there were.</p>

<p>In the homeland governments these Bantu public servants can go on to become full-fledged secretaries of their departments. There are at this stage already six departments, and the Transkei will be getting more, but there are six in all the other ethnic government public services. They can go on to become full-fledged secretaries of the departments. Not only with the emolument attached to that position, but also the status and the housing and all the other things attached to it. They can go on to become deputy secretaries of their departments, and all the other ranks from there on down. Now I am asking the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if the hon. member for Transkei does not want to reply &#x2026; [Interjections.] Do not be so hurt when I ask a fair question. Answer my question.</p>

<from><span class="col_6801-6802" refersTo="page_0534"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The contents of this Bill are precisely, with all due respect, to enable these Bantu people to go on to occupy positions in the Public Service in their own homeland governments which they cannot occupy in White South Africa and to which they cannot attain. My objection is that the hon. member complained here, saying: &#x201C;What new opportunities will there be for the Bantu?&#x201D; What he implied is not true, Sir.</p>

<p>Let me now furnish hon. members with the background to this Bill. Then they will see that what this entire matter amounts to is that we had no alternative but to come forward with this Bill. I repeat that this has been the situation in the Transkei since as long ago as 1963. All Bantu teachers in the Department of Bantu Education have in terms of the Bantu Education Act for several years already been transferred to their homeland governments, with excellent results. This is therefore no new principle at issue here. But let me now illustrate this matter to the hon. members on the opposite side by way of a practical example. The work which many Bantu public servants normally do in White South Africa is for example the same as is being done at Hammanskraal. I am just mentioning this as an example, because the same thing is happening in Vendaland and Shanganiland and all the other homelands; but I am taking Hammanskraal, which is not far from Pretoria, as an example. This is in the homeland and the work was transferred to the Tswana territorial authority, which is now in terms of this Bantu self-government Act which was passed here this year going to become the Tswana Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>Now, at Hammanskraal, at the moment, we still have one White in charge and we have two White assistants. Because the work is being transferred to the Territorial Authority of the Tswana people, as it has been transferred to the authorities of the other peoples, and because this Tswana homeland will now become a legislative assembly and will have its own Public Service, they have to occupy positions such as those of tax-collectors and staff which have to be employed in that taxation division at Hammanskraal. Otherwise the work cannot proceed. They must, for example, establish a department dealing with land, and they must appoint people to this department who will occupy all the necessary grades. Public servants must also be appointed in the charge offices, which are also being transferred to the homeland governments.</p>

<p>The homeland government is also being entrusted now with the responsibility for its own Public Service. That is why they must man their own Public Service. Posts in the charge offices and the courts must be filled. The clerk of the court and other staff must be appointed. At Hammanskraal we already have a Bantu who even holds court. So I can continue to mention scores of examples of posts which must be filled in the homelands. Since this work now has to be transferred to the homeland governments, the position which forms the basis of this Bill is that without this Bill we would have had to keep on doing one of two things <i>ad infinitum:</i> The Bantu, for example, who occupy those positions in our service at Hammanskraal, we would have had to dismiss. After all, we would not then have that work for them any more. [Interjections.] Just give me a chance. After all, it would be prejudicial to those Bantu if we had to dismiss them.</p>

<p>Why should they be dismissed? Surely they can be transferred?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Because that work is now being transferred to the homeland government, we have no other alternative than to come forward with this Bill. That is why the Bantu self-government Act in the Transkei made provision for this from that very outset, and with excellent results for eight years. We do not want to dismiss the Bantu officials because that would be unfair to them. The only alternative was therefore to come forward with this Bill, for what have we done in the meantime? On the basis of our fair approach to the Bantu we have kept these Bantu in service and have loaned them to the territorial authorities of the Tswana and others. But we cannot continue to loan those officials to them, because it would be unfair to the Bantu. That is why we are now making it possible for that territorial authority to employ those Bantu themselves and to include them in their own establishments, with all the benefits attached to that. If the hon. members understand this, they will not make such nonsensical remarks as hon. members made this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am simply giving the hon. member the facts. If he does not like them, there is nothing I can do about it. That is why I say that there is nothing new in this principle. When the Transkei Constitution Act was passed, provision was made for transferring Bantu officers.</p>

<p>The hon. member also discussed the protection of rights. In this regard the facts are simply that the proviso to subsection (7), which hon. members may as well read, protects pension and other rights until the authorities determine otherwise. What other legislation would determine otherwise? While I am dealing with this, I just want to point out that it was I who piloted through the Pensions Act for the Bantu authorities this year. The hon. member who was waxing so eloquent this afternoon, did not have a word to say when that Act was being discussed. The Opposition did not even oppose that Act. The only member who discussed it, was the hon. member for Umbilo. In anticipation of this Bill, the Act made provision for the protection of the rights of these Bantu. I can remember that that hon. member Mr. Oldfield, rose and asked whether there would be a fundamental difference, and whether the Bantu would not be worse off. We then gave him the assurance that the rights of such Bantu would be protected and that they would under no circumstances be worse off. In addition, a set of staff regulations have already been published for each territorial authority, regulations which have been cast in the mould of the Public Service Regulations. Just now, when I asked the hon. member a question in regard to the Transkei, he said: Yes, but the Transkei is now being protected by the Public Service Regulations. I am now informing the hon. member that in respect of each of these other homeland governments regulations have been promulgated which were cast in the same mould as the Public Service Regulations. They are protected by these regulations. All these regulations are the same and the Venda regulations, for example, provide <i>inter alia</i> that (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">The transfer of an officer or an employee from the Public Service of the Republic to the Venda Territorial Authority affects in no respect the continuity to the accumulating vacation leave privileges of such an officer or employee who has been transferred without a break in service, and accumulated vacation leave remains standing to the credit of such officer or employee,</block>

That is true. Section 10 of that Act does so in a wonderful manner. I was very glad today to receive that compliment from hon. members opposite.

<from><span class="col_6805-6806" refersTo="page_0536"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But of course they can do that. If they do that, they are doing it in respect of their own people and then it will not be my or anyone else's responsibility. After all, they also have an obligation now to look after their own welfare. But we, on our part, are protecting these people&#x2019;s rights, exactly as was done in the Bantu administration legislation.</p>

<p>But [ want to go even further. In terms of ex sting regulations one of the functions of the Commission is to make recommendations concerning the scales of salaries, wages and allowances of all the various classes and grades of officers and employees. Surely such a commission will not do its work in an irresponsible manner. Surely it will take those salary scales into account. It will not allow an official to be transferred at a lower salary. In this way we are directing a friendly request and instructions to the Commission that it should not do this. Therefore we are in fact looking after the welfare of these people as we have in fact done in the other cases. As soon as a start is made with public services of their own, the question of salaries will of course have to be considered. It is self-evident that these will have to be adjusted to the corresponding scales in the Public Service; otherwise the staff will not be attracted. If the salary scale is not attractive enough, how would one be able to attract staff? It is also obvious that in the same way as pension and leave rights have already been protected, so the salaries of those who have been transferred will also be protected by means of adjustment to appropriate scales and recognition of former service in the Public Service. My standpoint has been, from the beginning, that when such transfers are made, I prefer the person who is being transferred to be better off to the tune of one notch than under the old dispensation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point and others as well, made the point that it would be possible to transfer these officials summarily and that they have no say it? the whole set-up. But that is not true. The staff cannot simply be transferred summarily. The provision in question reads that the officer or employee may, when the public interest so requires, &#x201C;be transferred, on the recommendation of the Commission, to the service of a non-White authority on such conditions as may be prescribed on the recommendation of the Commission ..</p>

<p>I am trying to explain to the hon. members that what they said is not true. I am now telling the hon. members that the legislation provides that the Commission has the final say. From this it appears in the first instance that the provision is empowering. That the hon. members for Green Point and Transkei should be able to understand, because I think they are attorneys. The provision is therefore empowering. The hon. members may as well read it and look into the matter. The persons may be transferred, ..</p>

<p>Very well; he may be transferred, but there are no sanctions if he refuses to go. The hon. members cannot show me any sanction in that clause which is directed at the man who does not want to leave, hon. members may as well try, so that I can see it. There are no sanctions. In addition the transfer depends on whether the authority to which he is being transferred, is willing to accept him. That is therefore the second requirement. Thus, this clause is simply an empowering clause. The person may he transferred, but for the rest the transfer depends on whether the authority to whom he is being transferred, the homeland authority, is willing to have him. There can be no transfer if the authority does not want that person. What results from this is surely very clearly that such a Bantu official must in the first instance be willing to go, because no one will want to employ an unwilling official. Surely that is self-evident. In addition it appears from that clause that transfer must take place &#x201C;when the public interest so requires&#x201D;. That is the third requirement. Why did the hon. member not inform the House of this? From this it appears very clearly that there is only one body that can decide whether it is in the public interest or not, and that is the Public Service Commission. Transfers may only take place on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>I am mentioning this as one example of the public interest. The Public Service Commission is a responsible body and with these three requirements which I have just stated and which are included in the legislation, surely it is clear that it is not correct to say that an official may be summarily transferred, and that that is the end of the story. There are three very important requirements which have to be complied with, and then in addition there is a responsible body involved, namely the Public Service Commission. With such a body it is surely very clear that the hon. members are quite wrong in their view of this matter, and that they are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people.</p>

<p>There is still a fourth requirement. It is that a transfer can only take place &#x201C;on such conditions as may be prescribed on the recommendation of the Commission&#x201D;. Therefore the hon. member for Green Point is quite wrong if he wants to create the impression that the Commission exercises no control over this. The Commission continues to exercise control at all times. I want to repeat that this is a very responsible body, or does the hon. member want to say that the Public Service Commission is not a responsible body?</p>

<p>Because this matter deals with the development of the Bantu homelands, they just want to arouse suspicions in regard to the matter. That is all hon. members on the opposite side want to do. That is why I want to say with the greatest emphasis that the Commission will exercise supervision and control throughout, and that it is hardly conceivable that the Commission will give its approval to any conditions which are fundamentally prejudicial to persons being transferred. That is why I am grateful to be able to say that the conditions which we have applied to the Bantu Administration Act are also being applied in this legislation, as far as possible.</p>

<p>Lastly, I just want to say that we will not proceed in a haphazard way here. We are not simply going to transfer all Bantu Public Servants, even in Bantu Administration and Development, to these homeland governments at one go. This will be done gradually, as the need arises and as the vacancies arise in the homelands with the increasing responsibilities that are being conferred on them, so that the officials who are now in the White Public Service may in that way, which I think is a very fine, reasonable, fair and humane manner, he transferred to their various public service departments.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>We have had some very interesting arguments from the Minister. These arguments do, if you will allow me to say so, contain an element of illusion. First of all, the hon. the Deputy Minister takes the attitude, in explaining the Bill of &#x201C;do not read this <span class="col_6809-6810" refersTo="page_0538"/>legislation &#x2014;just listen to me. It is what I say which is the true explanation of the intention of the legislator, not the words in the Act". He has told us that, whatever the words may say, &#x201C;our intention is not to go into this matter rashly and precipitately. We will deal with the matter quietly. Don&#x2019;t worry! Never mind about the Act&#x2014;just trust me. I will see to it that everything takes place in due and slow order.&#x201D; Well, Sir, we are discussing here not the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s character, but the contents of this Bill and more specifically clause 4 (b). The hon. the Minister has in the past, and again today, done his trick with mirrors on the <i>de facto</i> and the <i>de jure</i> situation. Some matters are <i>de facto</i> and some are <i>de jure.</i> When you look at them too carefully, he turns the mirror round and it is the other way round. The hon. the Deputy Minister has produced the argument that what we see envisaged by this Bill is something which has in fact been happening for a long time in the Transkei. He says it has been happening most satisfactorily that civil servants have been transferred to the Transkei. They are extremely happy there and have no complaints at all. Now, Sir, if this is possible, why do we need new legislation? If it is possible to achieve this great state of happiness under the old legislation, why do we need new legislation to achieve this very object? Is it intended to add to their happiness?</p>

<p>We have heard the argument that what has been done in the past&#x2014;and we agree with it&#x2014;was done with the consent of the civil servants. If a civil servant was transferred to the Transkei, it was done with his consent. Now, quite clearly, in terms of this new legislation, however much the Minister may argue, there is no provision for the consent of the civil servant concerned. The hon. the Minister has argued that there are other means of looking after his interests. The Public Service Commission will look after his interests to ensure that no injustice is done to him. The civil servant is ordered to go; his consent is not sought; he refuses to go; and the hon. the Minister says there is no provision whereby he can be forced to go, and he will suffer no punishment if he does not go. This Bill must be read in the context of the Public Service Act. Section 17 of that Act states that &#x2018;&#x2018;any officer &#x2026; shall be guilty of misconduct &#x2026; if he contravenes any provision of this Act or fails to comply with any provision thereof with which it is his duty to comply&#x2019;; or if he disobeys, disregards or makes wilful default in carrying out a lawful order given to him by a person having the authority to do so. This is perfectly clear. In the Bill we are considering today, provision is made for a civil servant to be transferred and we agree that there will be due consideration by the Public Service Commission when he is transferred. But that having been done, he has two options. One is that he can go wherever he is ordered to go and where he may in due course become subject to the laws of the new territory. He is being asked to go blindly and unknowingly into a new situation without his consent where other laws operate, whether it is his territory or not, and new contracts made with him.</p>

<p>I want to put it to this House that it is not easy to recruit civil servants in this country. When a civil servant is recruited he is given a certain degree of inducement to carve a career for himself in the civil service. The most important inducement that is held out to him is security of tenure. This is a most important factor. He is not offered a very high salary, but be is offered a dignified service with security of tenure. This is precisely what he is now being deprived of. When a civil servant joins the public service he enters into a contract with the public service whereby certain guarantees are given and accepted. One of the major guarantees of his employment is security of tenure. It is done in the form of a contract and this contract is jealously, carefully and honourably safeguarded by the Public Service Commission. The commission is the watchdog of the public service and of its interests. It is conceded that under these new provisions a public servant may be taken away from the service which he joined under that <span class="col_6811-6812" refersTo="page_0539"/>specific set of conditions and under those specific safeguards and can, without his consent, be transferred to another public service in another territory. It must be recognized that that territory may become self-governing and independent.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>It does not matter whether it is his people or any other people. He has a contract with a given set of people, and is then unwillingly pushed into a contract with other people while he does not know what the terms of his new contract will eventually be. When the terms of the contract are altered by the new people, his own or any other people, the terms of that contract may be less favourable than the ones he accepted when he entered the service. This change takes place without his consent. It is perfectly obvious that a situation is created where a breach of contract can take place. There is no uncertainty about this. It is quite likely to happen. We feel it is only right to stand up here and defend the rights of people who have a contract with the State against being forced into a situation where they will operate under a new contract the conditions of which are as yet unknown. There are all kinds of anomalies that can arise. I do not want to go into cases. Unlike the hon. member for Rissik. I was not at the Loskop Dam and the great Revelation was not made to me. But let us look at a few practical examples. It is a fact that there are a number of Shangaans in service in the South African Navy. Is it the intention that these Shangaans should be transferred from the South African Navy to a Shangaan navy and be put on the nominal roll?</p>

<p>There can be a nominal roll for Shangaan sailors. They can then be seconded back. This sort of thing becomes quite interesting. In fact, let me say for the benefit of that hon. member, that there is one point on which l think we can sincerely congratulate the Minister with regard to this curate&#x2019;s egg of a Bill. I call it a curate&#x2019;s egg of a Bill, Sir, because you will remember that the curate tasted the egg and said, &#x201C;this is a curious egg&#x201D;. When he was asked whether it was not all right, he said, &#x201C;Well, it is quite good in parts&#x201D;. We grant the hon. the Minister that his Bill is quite good in parts, but we are concerned about the other parts. The one good part possibly is that this Bill will create a new homeland industry, and the homeland industry that it will create is that scores of people will be employed making out nominal rolls for the 67 000 Bantu who will be transferred from the Civil Service of this country to their homeland civil services and then seconded back. Sixty-seven thousand names, with the changes which will occur through wastage will, I submit, give reasonable employment to a large section of people who are as yet without work!</p>

But, Sir, I want to put it to him that they can advance under the present set-up.

<p>When I arrived there, he said to me: &#x201C;Webber, one day in the next 40 years, if you remain in this department, you will come back here and you will be the only White man in this office&#x201D;. Now the hon. the Deputy Minister boasts about Hammanskraal and other places where this is the position. I want to remind him that that was under a United Party Government in 1946. It was then already the policy to allow these people to advance. We do not need a Bill such as this to allow the Bantu civil servants to advance. It is no good the hon. the Deputy Minister saying that that is the reason for this measure. The only reason for this Bill is the ideological clap-trap of this Government's policy. As has been pointed out, the Bill is only necessary because of this idea of separation.</p>

<p>I had an experience a few weeks ago when I had to go to court in one of the homelands. I went to that court as a complainant. I was the only White man in that court. The magistrate, the prosecutor, the clerk of the Court, the orderly and every other person there was a Bantu, I maintain that this is right and proper.

I want to ask the hon. the Minister of the Interior a question in this regard. Unfortunately, the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs has gone. He was here a minute ago, and I would have asked him this question, had he been here. Is he going to allow the same advancement in the case of the Indian and where are the Indians going to enjoy this advancement? I am glad to see that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is here. Is he going to allow the Coloureds to advance to the same extent as the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration is going to allow the Bantu to advance?

<p>Sir, I sincerely hope the hon. the Minister will come into the debate. Perhaps we shall then have this point clarified, because this Bill does not refer only to the Bantu. The hon. the Minister of the Interior, when he introduced this Bill, said that it was going to be applied to the Department of Bantu Administration and the Department of Bantu Education now. I accept that the provisions of the new section 13 (7) will be applied to these departments by proclamation as and when this arises, but that side has been silent as to when this is to be applied to the Coloureds and the Indians, and on how it is to be applied to the Coloureds and the Indians. I think that that side of the House, in the person of one of those hon. Ministers owes this House an explanation. We are being asked to approve this measure today, but we are being asked to give them a blank cheque with regard to the Coloureds and the Indians.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration: Has he consulted the Bantu employees in his department? Do they know what is in this Bill? Do they accept these provisions? Do they accept that they can be taken arbitrarily and transferred to another government? I do not believe they have been consulted. I want to say something else, and I am not sticking my neck out. I believe that most of those employees do not want to be transferred over and will not wish to be transferred over.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it was not my intention to reflect on the House, and I do withdraw it. While we are talking about these people who have not been consulted and who will be arbitrarily transferred to other governments, who will become employees of another government, with a possibility of being seconded back to this Government, has the hon. the Deputy Minister thought how this will affect the rights of those who are at present civil servants of the Republic of South Africa? He has been asked questions about the conditions of employment under these Bantu Authorities. I hope we will get a reply from the hon. the Minister of the Interior, because we have had no reply from the hon. the Deputy Minister. It has been pointed out that even after they are seconded there is no guarantee that their conditions of employment will remain the same, because they will be under a foreign government, and not from their own choice but because of an arbitrary decision. But this goes further. It affects other rights which pertain to these civil servants. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that a Bantu employed by the Civil Service in this country&#x2014;and there are 67 000 of them in the Republic&#x2014;enjoy certain privileges and certain rights, Influx control, for one, does not apply to him or to his family or to his children. What is their position going to be when we have the situation that arbitrarily, as someone put it earlier in the debate, by a journal entry in a book, they are going to be transferred to the employ of a foreign government or the government of a Bantu Authority, and then seconded back, so that physically there is no change so far as they are concerned.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I am just mentioning this in passing. Having done all this, these other rights to which I have referred are also affected. Has the Minister thought how he will protect those rights, and are the civil servants going to be <span class="col_6817-6818" refersTo="page_0542"/>happy to accept this change in their status? And, most important of all, having been transferred, they now become the employees of a foreign state. How can we in the Republic continue to ask them to give us their loyalty? Today they are utterly loyal to the Republic of South Africa. They are employed by the Republic of South Africa. But once they become employed by a foreign country and they are then asked to work in the Republic, for the Republic, will we retain their loyalty? Especially, are we going to retain their loyalty in the light of the fact that they will then suffer under certain disabilities under which they do not suffer today? As I have said, there are these privileges which are accorded to them in regard to influx control and the right of remaining in the White areas, particularly for their families. Sir, we could mention other rights, but these are the most important ones and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister has thought of this, and whether he can tell us how he intends to protect those rights.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of the Bill, in regard to this new subsection (7) which is being added to section 13 of the Act, about which I wanted clarity and hoped that I would get this clarity from the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration. I want to know what exactly is meant by this phrase &#x201C;when the public interest so requires&#x201D;? I asked the Deputy Minister that question. He has had the opportunity of explaining what is meant by &#x201C;openbare belang&#x201D;, but what is the answer we got from him? That a public servant must be prepared to move. [Interjection.] Yes, that is one of the reasons. What did you say?</p>

<p>That is the usual courtesy we expect from that side of the House. But I want to put it this way. I do not know what is meant by the &#x201C;public interest&#x201D;. What is the &#x201C;public interest&#x201D;? Is the &#x201C;public interest&#x201D; the interest of carrying out the policy of the Nationalist Party? Because that is the only reason I can see for this Bill and I do not believe that that is really in the public interest. It is in the interest of a section of the public; it is in the interest of a sectional government, but it is not in the public interest. I want to say that the intention behind this Bill is really the satisfaction of this Nationalist ideological policy, which is complete and total separation, even if the hon. member for Rissik disagrees with me. How many people are going to be affected by this Bill? Ultimately, 67 000 Bantu who were employed, are going to be affected. If one multiplies that by five, there are 300 000 people who will be affected, and that is only as far as the Bantu are concerned. Respectfully, I want to ask the hon. the Minister of the Interior how many Coloureds and how many Indians are in fact employed by the Civil Service as at the last day of the last report, which I think was on the 30th of June?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<p>105 000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#webber">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>If 105 000 are employed, and if we again take a family unit of 5, it concerns another 500 000 people. In other words, close on I million people are being involved here. Yet this hon. Minister in a matter of 10 minutes gave a short explanation. Surely, when we are dealing with nearly I million people, their futures and the privileges which they enjoy today, it deserves more than that? That is why this side of the House has taken the stand which it has taken. We are looking after the interests of these people. My comments with regard to the loyalty of the Bantu civil servants when they are seconded back also pertain and apply to the Coloured and Indian civil servants, when they will be seconded back to the Civil Service of the Republic of South Africa. Those who are going to be immediately affected, namely those in the employ of the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s two departments, total nearly 20 000 people.</p>

<p>There is another sneaking doubt at the back of my mind, which I hope the hon. the Minister can clear up. A short while ago we passed in this House the Bantu Homelands Constitution Bill. In terms of that Bill we gave to the Bantu Homeland Authorities the power to establish their own public service commission and to make regulations in this regard. We also gave them the power to make their regulations applicable to their citizens in the Republic of South Africa. Taking these two factors into consideration, when a Civil Servant is transferred to, for example, the Transkeian Government, is he going to come back under the conditions of employment of <span class="col_6819-6820" refersTo="page_0543"/>the Transkei, or is he going to come back under the conditions of employment of the Public Service Commission of the Republic? I know that the hon. the Deputy Minister says that the regulations drawn up for the Transkei are based on the regulations of our own Public Service Commission. Is this sufficient, however? Are the regulations identical in every respect? I know that they are not identical and so does the hon. the Deputy Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<p>Why should they be identical?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. T. WEBBER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not say that they should be identical. I have never alleged that they should be identical and I do not think anybody else has alleged that either. But this raises the very point which has been made so often or strengthens the case which has been raised concerning the subject, namely that these people, without their consent, are being placed in the employ of another Government tinder different conditions of employment even with regard to salaries. The hon. the Deputy Minister knows that the same salaries are not paid for the same jobs in the Transkei as are paid here in the Western Province. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister, with regard to the two provisions in the Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, if these persons, when they are seconded back to the Republic by means of a book entry, will remain here under the provisions of the Public Service Commission of the Republic or whether they will remain here under the conditions of the Public Service Commission of the Transkei or any other authority. I do not believe I need waste my time or that of the House any more. I am sure that we on this side of the House have made it quite clear why we are going to oppose this Bill which, when it was presented to us, seemed innocuous until we investigated it further, until we discovered its hidden parentage. I want to repeat what the hon. member for Green Point said, namely that we will oppose this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that this entire debate has changed into what I hoped it would not become, viz. a discussion of a minor part or clause of this submission which only indirectly affects our Bantu policy. During the discussion of this Bill, I had the feeling throughout that an ordinary point of policy was being discussed which should really have been discussed under the Vote &#x201C;Bantu Affairs&#x201D;, or at any of the other opportunities which exist during the course of a session to iron out this particular matter. Basically it is not this matter which is before the House today. This policy exists in any case. Hon. members know that the method which may be followed if one wants to or if one has to implement apartheid, is that machinery has to be created and the only place where that can be done, is this House. That has been done. Perhaps the details we furnished on this occasion were not adequate enough to the hon. members&#x2019; liking. The result was that a number of conclusions were drawn, on which statements were based which were definitely not correct. I want to admit at once that I am by no means an expert in this field. I did not try this afternoon, nor will I try, to tell the hon. members precisely where we are right and where we are wrong in respect of detailed sub-categories of this specific point. But what I could in fact do, and will do, is to indicate that at least as far as the Public Service Commission is concerned&#x2014;that is the side I am dealing with &#x2014;we will carry out this policy which has existed and has been ratified since 1948. It is very important to know that this is not the first time in history that secondment has become necessary in the Public Service Commission. This is very important because in the past we proceeded from the assumption that we only appointed a person to an establishment in an additional capacity. In other words, we did not second him in the full sense of the word. In any case, the Public Service Commission does not have those powers. With all due respect to hon. members who spoke here this afternoon about the powers of the Public Service Commission, and powers which already exist in terms of existing legislation and for which we need not make provision in this amendment Bill, I want to say that they should at least have taken the trouble to analyse the matter. The hon. members for Green Point and Transkei both made the point that there was existing legislation in terms of which this matter could be dealt with. I should like those hon. members on that side of the House to state in this House in terms of which Act machinery has been created which makes this action on the part of the Government possible? If that cannot be done, I want to say that I think that this was an opportunity to re <span class="col_6821-6822" refersTo="page_0544"/>commend a different approach than this one in regard to the Public Service Commission here. Surely it is our task to do so. Now I do not know what other possibilities hon. members on that side of the House may perhaps have had in mind. But in the existing machinery I see nothing which allows us to follow a course different to the specific course we did follow. In addition I should like to add something to what the hon. the Deputy Minister said here this afternoon. Something which runs very clearly through this entire discussion like a silver thread, is the fact that the amendment Bill cannot prejudicially alter the <i>status quo</i> of the present measures. It cannot alter the <i>status quo</i> to such an extent that it could be prejudicial to the Bantu, the Coloureds, the Indians, or anyone else. They will not be prejudiced by this specific machinery. This morning the hon. member for Transkei wove his entire tale around the fact that the only issue in this legislation was the question of the Bantu. That was very clear to me. But the hon. member subsequently corrected that.</p>

<p>The hon. member corrected that after lunch and said that it included the Coloureds and the Indians. I stated very dearly in my speech that this was a comprehensive piece of legislation, that it was not only intended for the Bantu group, but that it was intended for all three groups. In addition to that I said that in my opinion there was no reason why it should not also affect Whites in the entire process. As I view the matter further, if the existing legislation is there, does he simply want us to leave the Public Service Act as such unused if we are able to create opportunities for the Bantu as we are now able to do? On a subsequent occasion, when another opportunity presents itself, we shall certainly do this in respect of the Coloureds and the Indians. If one has this machinery now, the obvious way is not to do it step by step, in other words one group after the other, without necessarily proceeding from the assumption that the non-Whites will be worse off than the Whites, as hon. members wanted to impl throughout in this debate. I also want to say that there is no provision whatsoever in this Bill by means of which a non-White can in any way be compelled to do this. There is no indication in this entire legislation that he can be compelled to accept secondment. That is quite clear.</p>

<p>I repeat that there has never in the past been such a provision in the laws relating to the Public Service. There have never been provisions where a person may be required during negotiations or after negotiations, when he does not want to go to a certain place, to do so. It is not our intention to do so in this case. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister made that very clear to hon. members. This is the one cardinal point which I feel we could have differed on if there had actually been a few reasons in the past as a result of the actions of the Government which indicated that this would be the intention of this specific Bill. Sir, I do not want to say anything further about the matter. I only want to say that I feel personally that this is the only place where we could have introduced it, and that hon. members had sufficient time to study it. If they want to study, or discuss further, the Bantu aspect of the matter, they may do so under the Vote, which will be moved within the next week or two.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I address you on a point of order? I would like to take the point that you would probably wish to recuse yourself from the chairmanship of this Committee on the ground that you have taken part in the debate. It is submitted from this side of the House that, since you have taken part in the debate, you would not wish to sit in the Chair and preside over the rest of the debate in view of the fact that what you said might be in dispute, and where indeed you did take part in the debate. It is submitted that you are able to call upon the services of other chairmen and we submit that you would not like to be in that invidious position when you are presiding as an impartial chairman, presiding over this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member is confusing the position of Chairman of Committees with that of a judge in a court. There is nothing in the rules to prohibit a Chairman or Deputy Speaker from taking part in a debate. No Chairman in this Chair acts as a judge who has to decide between different judgments, and <span class="col_6825-6826" refersTo="page_0546"/>consequently there is no reason why any Chairman cannot take part in these debates. In fact, it has been the tradition in this Parliament since 1910 and it has been the tradition in the British Parliament since the sixteenth century for Deputy Speakers and Chairmen of Committees to be able to take part in debates in Parliament just as ordinary members do.</p>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member knows nothing about television and he knows even less about Foreign Affairs. I should like to attempt to keep this debate at a calm, high level, and I would appreciate it if the hon. member for Orange Grove would keep out of the mudhole he usually moves in. Sir, this exposure of the African States to the communists is a matter that does not only affect the Republic of South Africa. Ft affects all African leaders who display a sense of responsibility towards their own people in their own countries. The Republic of South Africa, is preeminently the country in Africa, and not only in Africa, but in the entire world, that prohibits the Communist Party by way of legislation. It is this National Party which, years ago, before the advent of independence for African States, already saw the dangers of Communism and then placed an Act on the Statute Book to make it clear that South Africa is anti-communistic. Not only did we act by way of legislation, but it is the wish of the people of South Africa that Communism should be opposed. Sir, we in South Africa have peace and quiet. Specifically for that reason we want to make our contribution to the combating of Communism in Africa, We are faced with the problem that the African States are young states which, in many cases, obtained independence before they had experienced the necessary political development. Many of them are economically poor countries, not having the financial capability to furnish their population with the necessary services. That is why their political development, their emergence to citizenship, their own identity, their own concept of identity, has been complicated because they do not have sufficient economic potential and support. There lies the danger for Africa. The danger for Africa lies in the fact that there are countries and powers offering pseudoaid to these countries. It is, of course, logical from the nature of the case that these countries&#x2019; leaders are exposed to the temptation of accepting this aid, and the present position is that by the acceptance of this pseudo-aid these countries are compromised by foreign powers whose intentions toward Africa are not sincere, countries which can eventually, by way of financial aid, effect the downfall of the relevant African States. Sir, South Africa is not only prepared to conduct a dialogue with African States, but we also realize that we have a task to fulfill in Africa, and our <i>bona fide</i> is being tested by these African States. In that connection we can prove our <i>bona fide</i> by our achievements. In the first place, South Africa is a part of Africa; in the second place South Africa has never in its history tried to become involved in a power struggle with other countries of Africa; we have never wanted to dominate other African States. On the contrary, our policy in South Africa is proof of the fact that we have no interest whatsoever in colonies or in the expansion of our territory. We ourselves are engaged in multi-national development in South Africa, and that is a proof to the African leaders that we are not begrudging other people their independent states in our own geographic area. That is why no African leader or nation ought to have any fear of a power struggle with South Africa. Secondly, South Africa is economically and financially a strong country. South Africa is a country which, as a result of its economic position in the technical sphere, has made tremendous contributions in Africa. We have granted technical assistance to neighbouring states and, apart from technical assistance, we also granted them assistance in connection with hospitals and medical services. Moreover, we are doing missionary work in Malawi, I still believe today that Malawi&#x2019;s success has a great deal to do with the missionary <span class="col_6827-6828" refersTo="page_0547"/>work being done there. But, Sir, this is not the only aspect that is important. What is of great importance is that these African States, under the present set-up, find it necessary to conduct a dialogue with us to determine what South Africa&#x2019;s <i>bona fide</i> is. In commerce we have proved our <i>bona fide.</i> Last year we exported goods to the value of R262 million to African States. We imported goods to the value of R131 million from African States. Economically we are strengthening Africa. We must accept the fact that we shall experience problems when we enter into a dialogue with these countries, because there are certain powers behind certain African states fanning hate and viciousness against South Africa, and therefore we must not expect a great deal of success to result from every discussion we conduct with these countries. The actions of the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister have proved unequivocally that they are achieving a great deal of success, but we cannot expect to be successful with every one of those discussions. We must not panic when certain countries imply that they only want to conduct a dialogue with us in order to jeopardize South Africa&#x2019;s policy of separate development. That is ridiculous. We have repeatedly stated in this House and outside that our national identity will be preserved. By conducting these discussions with other countries, respect will be generated for each other&#x2019;s feelings.</p>

<p>Sir, I should now like to come to what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said last night. I quote from the hon. member&#x2019;s Hansard (13th May, page ZZ.1)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government makes great play of our being a multi-national country, a country of many peoples, and ethnically speaking we are a multi-national country.</block>

<p>I am glad that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that. In other words. I can accept the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout believes in multi-nationality. If that is the case &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour? The hon. the Minister is a man with long experience in the field of foreign affairs. I want to say this for him that he is highly regarded among foreign representatives in South Africa, and, without a doubt, when he goes abroad, he is a good advertisement for South Africa. What always puzzles us on this side of the House is, however, that a man of his experience believes, or pretends to believe, that our international difficulties are mainly due to the fact that we are misunderstood abroad. I am going to leave alone the charge, which is heard so often in this House&#x2014;in fact, we have just listened to it again&#x2014; that the communists are responsible for all our troubles. To me this sort of argument sounds like admitting that the communists are completely outwitting us abroad. This is an awful thing to admit, considering how unclean the hands of the communists are and how little they really have to offer. Surely. Sir, the hon. the Minister must know that it is not merely a case of his Government&#x2019;s policies being misunderstood in the world. As we know, many countries are represented in South Africa. They are very well represented here, but apart from that, many hundreds of people from all over the world, important people among them, visit South Africa annually and look objectively at the Government&#x2019;s policies as applied in practice. I see many of the reports, some confidential, which these people draw up, and I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister finds these reports on his table. Only a day or two ago Prof. Ned Munger of the California Institute of Technology sent me a copy of a new publication called the &#x201C;Munger Africana Library Notes&#x201D;. It is quite a valuable publication, being an effort to make available unpublished reports in the field of current Africana. This particular copy contains the reports of three important people who have recently visited South Africa, namely, Dr. George Kennan, an American who was at one time his country&#x2019;s ambassador in Moscow. Prof. Leon Gordenker and Dr. Wilton Dillon, of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. These reports are generally sympathetic, but almost without exception, and this applies to them too, one finds that people who come here and look at the picture objectively go away knowing that there are situations in our country which, to use a now famous phrase a phrase which has emanated from that side, &#x201C;cannot be defended before God and man&#x201D;. Sir, we are waiting for the day when the hon. the Minister will come to Parliament and tell us that his Government has decided to disarm our opposition and to remove the many unnecessary impedimenta which obstruct our hopes of returning <span class="col_6829-6830" refersTo="page_0548"/>to normal relations internationally, I am prepared to say that I am far more worried about some of the truths that people know about us than many of the lies they believe, because a lie is quite easy to fight against. It is far easier to do so than to fight an ugly truth. As I was preparing a few notes for this debate there was the following report in the Cape morning paper to illustrate my point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Filipino Wife&#x2014;So No South African Visa: The French guitarist, Jean-Pierre Dumez, said here yesterday (in Rhodesia) that the South African authorities had refused him a visa because his wife was a Filipino. Mr. Dumez had planned to complete a concert tour of Africa in the Republic. He said South African officials in Salisbury and Malawi had said that he and his wife could enter the Republic separately to reach a ship to take them back to Europe, but they were told: &#x201C;If we were seen together in the street, we might find ourselves in gaol for six months, and I was not going to risk that,&#x201D;</block>

<p>This couple was allowed freely in the little, embattled Rhodesia. There were no problems in Rhodesia about allowing them in. But this is the kind of reaction that people like these get from the South African authorities. I want to ask the hon. the Minister straight out, because this I believe goes to the root of our international problems and it will also be our major problem when it comes to lasting good relations with other states in Africa. I want to ask the hon. the Minister, when he appears as the representative of South Africa at the United Nations and the representative of the Philippines confronts him there with the report I have just read out, how does he defend his Government? Does he blame the Philippine Government if they condemn our system? Does he blame the Philippine Government if they do not take kindly to our control of South-West Africa? Does he blame the Philippine Government if South African travellers have to sit cooped up on board ship in Manila harbour, as happens quite often, whilst travellers from other countries are allowed to disembark? I have taken the Philippines in this case merely as an example, but almost every country in Africa would have people in exactly the same position as this Filipino woman. Therefore the Government should realize that it may score small advances here and there, for reasons of a special kind, but I do not believe that there will ever be any substantial improvement in our international position as long as we maintain attitudes which insult people merely because of their nationality. One wonders what hope there is of any lasting relations with any African state as long as we in fact say to a Frenchman: &#x201C;You are welcome in our country, whether your wife is a Frenchwoman or a Pole, but you are not welcome if your wife is a Filipino or an African.&#x201D; To me. Sir, it is as simple as that, and I must say to the hon. the Minister that we have small confidence in any lasting success if the hon. the Minister really has no plans for an inward-directed movement of fruitful reform in South Africa in the field of human relations.</p>

<p>I said yesterday that we would like to deal with the question of dialogue, because I think that is the question which at the moment commands most of our interest. Our attitude on this side of the House has consistently been that every step in the direction of contact and communication with African states is a good step. Further, that whenever sufficient mutual interests have been established, we should not hesitate to establish diplomatic links and that we should not only welcome Black representatives if they come, but assure them of absolute equality of treatment in South Africa and the full freedom of all our country has to offer. But we believe on this side of the House that there is hardly a chance of our establishing lasting good relations with any significant section of the African Continent unless we are prepared to look the facts honestly in the face and to determine exactly what our position is. Whether the hon. the Minister agrees with us or not, as we see the present picture, speaking broadly, in Africa, every single Black country is opposed to us. There is no country which really likes us. Every country is opposed to the conditions under which Black people have to live in our country, and supports the point of view that apartheid is an outrage. Where they differ is over the question of strategy and approach and the measure of hope they entertain that some changes will be brought about in our country. I am not going to refer to those countries that are geographically closest to us and economically and otherwise so tied up with us that they themselves say&#x2014;otherwise I would not have said it&#x2014;that they have no choice but to <span class="col_6831-6832" refersTo="page_0549"/>maintain liveable relations with us. This applies mainly to the L.B.S. countries, namely Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland, and to a certain extent also to Malawi.</p>

<p>For the rest, as far as we can sec, opinion and strategy in the Africa camp is diverging and flowing in two directions: firstly, there is what still looks like being the majority direction, namely the direction of those who form the militant core of the Organization of African Unity, I refer to the countries led by countries such as Zambia and Tanzania. They openly believe in the application of coercive measures and that a change in South Africa can only be furthered by force. Mr. Vernon Mwaanga, the permanent representative of Zambia at the United Nations, only a few days ago put it to a committee of the United Nations that &#x201C;there is no hope of a peaceful change in South Africa&#x201D;, and that, for that reason, they believe in the application of coercive measures. That is where they stand and we know it. The second group is the group which has now become known as the Dialogue Group. Most prominent in this group, as we know, are President Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, Dr. Kofi Busia of Ghana, a close friend of his, President Bokassa of the Central African Republic and, of course, President Tsiranana of Madagascar, who is already a few solid steps ahead of the others and, as the hon. the Minister told us, will be sending his Vice-President and Minister of Foreign Affairs to South Africa in the very near future. This particular group believes that coercive measures against South Africa have been and will continue to be abortive and that every violent action presents the communists with a fresh opportunity of intervening on the continent of Africa. I think that we should appreciate that especially the President of the Ivory Coast feels very strongly and is particularly worried about this aspect of the situation in Africa. In any case, they believe quite apart from that, that contact and moral pressure, which is also the term used by President Nixon of the United States, are better methods for promoting change in South Africa than isolation or hostile action.</p>

<p>So they have come up with a new approach to the problem&#x2014;I use the word &#x201C;problem&#x201D; from their point of view&#x2014;of the South. Madagascar openly styles its South Africa policy &#x201C;the New Strategy'&#x2019;. This strategy is to establish communication with us with a view to opening up a free traffic between their country and ours and, eventually, establishing a noticeable Black presence in South Africa uninhibited by the country&#x2019;s apartheid rules. As we see it, the important thing to remember is that all countries in Africa have a certain common objective in respect of the southern sixth of the African continent, namely to see an end to policies on African soil which places Black people in a position of inferiority because they are Black. President Boigny himself has described our policy as &#x201C;revolting to the dignity of an African&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the light of this, I believe, we should not misunderstand the position if we want to get anywhere. We should not confuse the dialogue movement with what we call the Government&#x2019;s outward movement. As we see it, these are two separate movements, differently motivated and, indeed, in a sense they stand in contrast to each other. It is therefore much too early to interpret one movement as a success or a triumph for the other. The one seeks cooperation on the basis that the apparatus of apartheid must be dismantled, and the other seeks co-operation on the basis that race apartheid can stay.</p>

<p>Obviously we have now reached the point where we feel that something concrete must begin to happen if dialogue is not to become a process of stagnation. Several heads of State, those of the Ivory Coast, Ghana, the Central African Republic and others have indicated publicly their willingness to meet with us. The chief apostle of dialogue, President Boigny, even specified his basis for discussion with us, namely the Lusaka Manifesto. An agenda has therefore also been proposed by those who support dialogue. President Bokassa of the Central African Republic has in fact gone so far as to say that he was prepared to come to South Africa for talks with the Prime Minister and to open full diplomatic relations with our Republic,</p>

<p>The Government has responded to these overtures, but in very general terms. That is what I meant when I said yesterday that we were in fact a little disappointed that the hon. the Minister did not go a little further in responding to these definite overtures. I am sorry to say that the hon. the Minister again had little more to offer than to once more express his satisfaction with <span class="col_6833-6834" refersTo="page_0550"/>the trend of events. Our feeling is that the time has come for formal invitations if we wish to get anywhere at all,</p>

<p>As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we believe that it is a matter of the greatest urgency for South Africa to bring about a state of normality between us and the rest of Africa. There is no other way of eliminating the mounting offensive of terrorism against us. Time and again the hon. the Minister of Defence and the chief of the Army stress the fact that there is a growing danger of terrorist offensives against South Africa. We believe that until we come to proper relations with Africa there will be no other way of eliminating this growing threat to our country. There is also no other way of halting any communist advance in Africa. There is no other way of counteracting the Russian presence in the Indian Ocean and in the seas around South Africa. There is no other way but agreement with Africa if we successfully want to combat the new form of terrorism which seems to have stuck out its neck in the form of sea piracy. As long as they have bases along the coasts of Africa which are hostile to South Africa from which they can operate, they will be very hard to eliminate.</p>

<p>So, from every point of view it is of vital importance that we come to a proper understanding with Africa. In fact, the road to normal relations with the other major nations of the West, also lies through Africa. The measure of our acceptability to Africa will be the measure of our acceptance by the West. The question is of course how we must proceed. We appreciate it that certain opportunities have opened Up for us. The question is how the Government is going to use these opportunities. We have certain suggestions to make in this regard. We believe that the most immediate step which the Government should take is to draw up a reply, and an honest reply, to the Lusaka Manifesto, in so far as it affects the questions of apartheid and South-West Africa. Whatever the hon. the Prime Minister himself might fee! about the Lusaka Manifesto, I do not think we should continue to under-estimate the impact and the importance of this manifesto. President Nixon of the United States called it a &#x201C;statesmanlike document&#x201D; and he &#x201C;warmly welcomed&#x201D; it in these words. He was one of several heads of State who spoke of some of the commitments laid down in that document as guidelines to be followed in respect of policies in Africa. Yesterday we received reports that both Kenya and Nigeria stood committed to the Lusaka Manifesto. The same applies to Ghana. As I have already said. President Houphouet-Boigny himself has proposed that the Lusaka Manifesto should form the agenda for talks with Pretoria.</p>

<p>We feel that the Government should reply by way of a positive act; it should reply by way of a Pretoria Manifesto. The Government continually claims that its policy of separate development or apartheid is in fact a policy of liberation for all and not of domination. If this is so, and if the Government really believes that its objectives can bear honest scrutiny, I want to urge them, in fact I want to throw it out as a challenge, that they publish a Pretoria Manifesto. In that manifesto they should set out clearly and unequivocally the principles underlying their policy of human relationships together with their objectives in respect of the future citizenship status and position of each of our population groups, the Blacks, the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians. Further they should re-enunciate in it clearly the Government&#x2019;s undertaking to the United Nations &#x201C;to eliminate all forms of political inequality in South Africa&#x201D;. Then they should go further by indicating clearly in the manifesto what practical steps are being taken to implement this undertaking which was given to the United Nations. Finally the Government should set out its objectives for South-West Africa and its determination to settle the dispute by applying the policy of self-determination in South-West Africa in a manner which will be consistent with the accepted meaning of the term. I know that the question of South-West Africa is a matter which the Ivory Coast in particular is interested in, as that country is a member of the United Nations special committee dealing with dependent countries and peoples.</p>

<p>Having done all this and having set up the Pretoria Manifesto, the Government should offer this as an agenda for dialogue, coupled with an invitation to the leaders of the dialogue entente to visit South Africa personally and to come and see for themselves. We know the hon. the Prime Minister well. I want to hand this to him, he is a most effective politician when his platform is a party political one, but frankly, I have had another look at his letter to President Kaunda as it was printed <span class="col_6835-6836" refersTo="page_0551"/>in Hansard. Therein he, the Prime Minister, tries to explain &#x201C;the basic philosophy underlying the policy of separate development". I am sorry to say so, but this is far from a masterpiece. I must say that if that is the sort of thing which is going to form the basis on which he hopes to convince men like President Boigny, a person whose second home is Paris, I would say that he should not even try it.</p>

<p>Yes, I do not think that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s effort in explaining his own policy was very successful. [Interjections.] Anyhow, that is my opinion. I do believe that a much better job could have been done and that the occasion was a very important occasion on which it could have been done. The opportunities which have opened up for us are to be welcomed, but it is necessary that we should warn that it could be very dangerous for us if it should misfire, because many eyes in Africa are turned on men like President Houphouet-Boigny. However, many big guns are also trained on him. I am not so sure that we are as well aware of the dangers that will come to South Africa if the effort at dialogue should fail, because this will be used as proof by the militant group of the Organization of African Unity that there is no hope for any sort of agreement and arrangement with South Africa. That is why we believe that we should go all out to ensure that the efforts of the dialogue group do not fail. As I have said, should it fail, it will enormously strengthen the hands&#x2014;which none of us wants to see&#x2014;of those who preach force. It will be used as proof that force against us is the only answer.</p>

<p>It appears to me that we stand to lose more than anybody else if the dialogue efforts were to come to nought. Therefore I want to say frankly to the Government that I think they should stop pretending that there is nothing which requires reform in our country in the field of human affairs.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member for Rustenburg. Resolutions of the United Nations constantly emphasize the point that there should be full respect for the national and cultural identity of peoples or distinct ethnic groups within any country. There is no problem for us in respect of wanting to maintain our identity. Nobody is against that. But we will have to become a people with good neighbours, not only without, but also within. Dr. Anton Rupert recently expressed his concern about what he called &#x201C;the powerful stranglehold of anti-South Africanism in the world&#x201D;. To think that that obstacle will be overcome by just doing nothing internally is, I think, extremely unrealistic. I want to agree with Dr. Anton Rupert that, the forces pitted against us are so formidable&#x2014;and I use his words&#x2014; &#x201C;that there is no more time for pettiness&#x201D;, and that we should seriously consider what we can do to remove attitudes and situations in our country which form an obstacle to better relations with other countries.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s entire speech, as far as I am concerned, amounts to only one thing: he wants the Lusaka Manifesto to be accepted in South Africa. He says that we must look at the realities here in South Africa. He says be is not afraid of the lies that are being spread in the world and that other people are believing, but that he is afraid of the truth about South Africa, of which we cannot prove the opposite. Why does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout not tell us exactly how his party envisages changing the internal structure in South Africa? When I read the Lusaka manifesto, it struck me that the countries who signed it at the very beginning accepted the fact that conditions in their own countries were not such that they could also defend them at all times before the world. They also state pointedly that they are just trying to gradually rectify the conditions that are not justifiable in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>Here in South Africa there are two views that are diametrically opposed. The National Party accepts the rights of every person to govern himself and to have even possible opportuntiy for development. That is what the entire policy of the National Party is based on. The hon. member says that we shall not be able to convince other States that we are moving in the direction of the least possible discrimination. I would rather adopt the view that Dr. Verwoerd was being sincere when he wrote, at the time, to Sir Robert Menzies in Australia and told him that as the policy of separate development in South Africa developed in all its consequences. <span class="col_6837-6838" refersTo="page_0552"/>discrimination in South Africa would become less and less necessary. Discrimination as a method for preventing irritation between various races will become less and less necessary. With what it has thus far done, the National Party has to a very large extent succeeded, here in South Africa itself, in obtaining the goodwill of the Bantu leaders and also of a considerable proportion of other non-White leaders. If we have succeeded in convincing these other peoples in South Africa of our honesty and sincerity, we will have that much more hope of also being able to convince the African states that South Africa is sincere in its endeavour to let justice prevail here in South Africa for everyone. I do not think that one inevitably has to accept the fact that as a result of statements being made by President Boigny and others, to the effect that the Lusaka Manifesto must be the basis of discussion in any dialogue between us and them, that this is the only reason why there is any interest whatsoever in a dialogue with South Africa. I believe that it is their honest opinion that they hope they can convince us that we must accept the principle of equality between people as quickly as possible. I think they are realistic enough to realize that there are other considerations that are perhaps of much greater importance at this stage, not only to them, but also to us. It has been shown here that even President Nixon, in his latest policy statement to Congress on 25th February of this year, said in respect of that figure that it is in the interests of the states in Africa, which have now got over their birth pangs, that here in South Africa and in the rest of Africa this Continent should be prevented from becoming the battlefield of clashing ideologies and group interests of the big powers in particular. I think that President Boigny and others will agree with him when he says that possibly this Continent&#x2019;s biggest need at this stage is for the greatest possible amount of assistance to be given for allowing the development that can take place here to do so as rapidly as possible. Thus employment opportunities will be created for the masses that are today, in fact, only doing a small amount of work in Africa. In this way there will be a higher standard of living for all peoples in Africa.</p>

<p>Against this background I want to allege that there are much bigger considerations than the mere ideological questions that will be relevant when we are holding discussions with other Black states in Africa. I just want to point out that several thinkers and writers, attached to the various United Nations organizations, all people whom I believe to be honest and sincere in their views that the standard of living in Africa must be increased, all come to the conclusion that development can only take place if bloc formation or regional co-operation takes place here in Africa. Even someone like Mr. Ewing, who has been working in the United Nations for years and who is at present staying in the Congo, recently wrote a book in which he worked out a complete plan of how this regional co-operation should take place. My only criticism about this thinking is that most of these people proceed from the assumption that bloc formation can be successful in Southern Africa without South Africa being a part of that bloc. I therefore want to indicate briefly this afternoon that it is not possible to achieve much by means of regional co-operation in Southern Africa if the Republic of South Africa is not a part of that bloc or region. In the first place it is clear to us all that even in spheres such as tourism, where there were recent consultations in Malawi and where that country took the lead in obtaining cooperation in connection with this industry. South Africa should actually form the nucleus of such a plan. South Africa has a much better infra-structure than any other peoples here in Southern Africa. South Africa has much better means of communication and other facilities than these countries; South Africa has the capital with which to be able to pay more than other countries for the advertising that has to be done in the rest of the world. Without South Africa, it would not be possible to make a success out of even such an industry, which ought to be developed relatively easily on a regional basis. I therefore want to allege that if one investigates every industry that could possibly be established in any of the States here south of the Equator, South Africa must, of necessity, form a part of such a plan. It is clear to me that even our practical leaders, who have a knowledge of development throughout the world, must, of necessity, realize that in this process, in which not only capital must be contributed, but in which practical knowledge, in particular, must be furnsihed for these undertakings, South Africa must he an essential part of that plan. I mention here by name someone like Mr. Anton Rupert who recently announced that the National Development <span class="col_6839-6840" refersTo="page_0553"/>and Management Foundation intends to form a bank via Luxembourg for the economic development of Equatorial and Southern Africa. Recently an article appeared written by Mr. G. K. Helleiner, the Director of Economic Research at the University College of Dares-Salaam, in which he claimed that the most important item lacking for development in all these states in Southern Africa, Tanzania included, was the lack of private knowledge or &#x201C;know-how&#x201D;, as it is called, in establishing industries and having them succeed. I therefore think that this latest step, with its origins here in South Africa, is probably a milestone for projects still to come and on which the prosperity of this region, of which we form a part, will be built in the future.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to start by referring to the so-called outward policy and by making the point that as far as this outward policy towards Africa is concerned, there is in fact no difference in principle between the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. It is mainly in respect of the implementation of that policy, the way in which that policy is being carried into effect, that differences in fact exist. In regard to the attempts at an outward policy, it was in fact this side of this House, the United Party, that realized many years ago already that we have a role to play in Africa; that Sotuh Africa must play its full role in Africa and that it had a large contribution to make towards solving the problems of Africa. It started as long ago as 1929, when Gen. Smuts went to Oxford to deliver the &#x201C;Rhodes Memorial Lecture&#x201D;, on which occasion he made an appeal to all the powers who had interests in Africa to try to co-operate and find methods by means of which it would be possible to solve Africa&#x2019;s problems through joint action. That lecture led to the African Survey of Lord Hailey, famous throughout the world; as well as Dr. Worthington&#x2019;s book &#x201C;Science in Africa&#x201D;. Their expositions of the problems led in due course, after the Second World War, to the establishment of the Commission for Technical Co-operation in Africa. As you know. Sir, in due course that commission developed into a reasonably effective body, but because a considerable number of African states became independent, South Africa was out in the first instance and subsequently a few of the colonial powers, after which the organization collapsed. At present there are only a few remains. I have mentioned these facts because I want to explain that this outward policy and this feeling that we have a contribution to make in Africa, emanated from both sides of this House as well as from all sections of the population who reflect on these matters. Therefore, there is in fact no argument about this. In the past, however, there were arguments. For example, in 1962, when Sir Abubakar Balewa asked whether he could visit South Africa, the Leader of the Opposition recommended strongly to the Government that he should be invited to come here. However, the Government refused to invite him, firstly, because he had criticized South Africa and, secondly, because he was an uninvited guest who had not submitted his request through diplomatic channels. It was the late Dr. Verwoerd who adopted that attitude, and Balewa was not invited. That decision was supported by several members still sitting in this House.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Carletonville was one of the members who opposed the visit. He was one of the persons who were not in favour of a visit from Abubakar Balewa, The reason Dr. Verwoerd gave at the time, and which was supported by those hon. members, was that Abubakar Balewa had criticized South Africa, that he had invited himself and that he had not applied through diplomatic channels, For these reasons those members opposed the visit We are very pleased to see that a change has taken place.</p>

<p>Although a new dialogue is probably going to take place, we doubt whether it will in fact lead to a change, unless a change of standpoint takes place on both sides as well. I am purposely saying &#x201C;on both sides". It is not only we who are going to persuade them to accept our point of view, nor they who are going to persuade us to accept their point of view. Concessions will have to be made on both sides. There will have to be a general adjustment and a compromise.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is said, especially on that side of this House, that South Africa will <span class="col_6841-6842" refersTo="page_0554"/>never be able to satisfy the extremists; in other words, it is not worth while making any concessions as nothing short of complete capitulation is expected of us. It is true, of course, that the extremists, those who adopt that standpoint, expect much more from us than we are able to concede, but diplomacy is not concerned with those extremists. There are many countries &#x2014;and these are the important countries &#x2014;which in fact want to see an improvement in our relations with Africa, with the U.N.O. and with the world, and which will be satisfied with much less than what the extremists ask of us. In other words, if we were to make the minimal concessions which those countries, our friends, expect of us, we would already have achieved something and have made progress. If, to some extent, we were able to satisfy our friends, the reasonable countries seeking an improvement in relations, we would, because of that satisfaction, also succeed in neutralizing our enemies, the extremists, to a large extent.</p>

<p>Now, what are the very changes we will have to make? When we discuss foreign relations and our internal policy under that Government, we are always inclined to state our policy ire terms of the homelands policy, separate development, multi-nationalism, etc. Now I want to make the statement in this House that those arguments do not get us much further overseas, and i shall mention cases to prove this. What foreign countries actually look at is not our peasantry in the reserves. They do not have much interest in that problem. They know it is a low priority. What they actually look at, is our urban Bantu. They also look at our Coloureds, and especially at our Indians, Chinese and other Asiatics. A very large section of the world is interested in these very people and they are especially interested in the problems of the people trying to adjust to the modern urban society. I want to furnish a few examples. Recently Mr. Newson from the Department of State paid a visit. He wrote a very sympathetic report and appealed to the Americans to try to obtain better relations with South Africa by means of communication. He pushed aside matters such as isolation and violence and said there was only one thing; there must be communication. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Newson said there are four areas to look for in the years ahead to determine whether the present leadership in South Africa is really going to permit peaceful change: (1) Petty apartheid, such as separate facilities; (2) The whole attitude of the Government towards the rule of law and the courts; (3) The question of the urban Africans, the Coloureds and the Indians. This represents the heart of the problem, Mr. Newson said. &#x201C;Perhaps in this area some ultimate accommodation will be most necessary&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Now, there is no point in discussing separate development with Mr. Newson, or with the American Department of State or with the American Government. The whole question is concerned with these very key points he mentioned here. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke of the possibility of a Pretoria manifesto, and I want to suggest very seriously to the Government that if they were to think of issuing such a manifesto one day, as a basis for co-operation with the African States &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

<p>I find it very interesting that hon. members opposite always try to discuss our foreign problems in the light of development along individual lines. I think hon. members on this side have adequately informed the world of how we see our problems in the light of our policy, but I think the world would he very interested to know how our problems would be solved in terms of their policy. So why do they fail to tell the world: If we were to come into power, we would handle matters in such a way and solve them in that way. I just want to say to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that development along individual lines is the policy stated by the leader of this party and not the policy he tried to state.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening the hon. the Minister indicated to this House how in recent times various leaders of African states had repeatedly emphasized the desirability of dialogue with South Africa. For a considerable time President Banda of Malawi has been the fearless pioneer in this regard, and he definitely deserves the honourable mention and high appreciation of South <span class="col_6843-6844" refersTo="page_0555"/>Africa. During the past months, an African leader who is not so well known in South Africa and who is from a country situated considerably further away from South Africa, distinguished himself because of the level-headedness and objectivity which he has revealed in advocating the desirability of dialogue with South Africa. This leader is, of course the man with the difficult name of Houphouet-Boigny, the President of the Ivory Coast. It is realized everywhere that this breakthrough in favour of dialogue with South Africa among African leaders places us in South Africa before challenging opportunities to wider contact with Africa. It is also an indisputable fact that such contact is extremely necessary and desirable for the further development of Africa in the interests of peace and the prosperity of the people of Africa. It can be concluded from several of President Boigny's statements that he is in fact concerned about the peace and prosperity of Africa. Unlike President Kaunda and the Organization for African Unity, however, he does not believe the story that the peace of Africa is being threatened by the White peoples of South Africa. President Boigny has referred with considerable anxiety and alarm, however, to those African States which have closer relations with Red China and Russia. It is clear that he is trying to warn these states that there is great danger of an Asiatic imperialism for Africa and that it may disturb the peace and prosperity. It is essential for Africa to take note of the difference in approach of these two African leaders. President Boigny, the sophisticated statesmen, believes that above all Africa needs peace and that this peace is being threatened by the infiltration of Russian and Chinese imperialists. In order to resist this threat so that Africa may be developed in peace, he believes that everybody in Africa should co-operate, whether they be Black patriots of Africa or White patriots of Africa. At the risk of personal unpopularity in his own ranks, he says that the Whites of Southern Africa are Africans as well and that they therefore have a particularly important role to play in the development of Africa. For that reason he says there should be dialogue and good relations between Black and White Africans.</p>

<p>As opposed to this, we have the opportunism of President Kaunda and of the Organization for African Unity. President Kaunda&#x2019;s main aim seems to be to gain honour for himself. As long as he may be chairman of the Organization for African Unity and as long as he may possibly become chairman of the General Assembly of the United Nations Organization, he shouts hate and revenge at South Africa in public, because he thinks that that is the popular thing to do. But secretly he tries to keep open a back door because he knows that friendship and co-operation with Southern Africa is of great importance to his country and his people. The shortsightedness of President Kaunda and the Organization for African Unity and their inability to place the interests of Africa above their own blind prejudice, are, however, best illustrated by the decision taken earlier this year at the eighth session of the meeting of the Freedom Committee held at Moshi in Northern Tanzania. It was decided, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Cabora-Bassa project should in future be the primary goal of the liberation struggle in Africa. Therefore the destruction of Cabora-Bassa is made priority No. I for all terrorist activities in Africa. The liquidation of the White Governments in Southern Africa, which first served as objective No. I, is made subordinate to this. Without any doubt, this decision of the Organization for African Unity, with President Kaunda as its main spokesman, is the most negative, the most shortsighted and the most foolish ever taken by this organization in the eight years of its existence. This organization seems to think that because it has failed hopelessly to perform any positive deeds whatsoever in the interests of Africa and the people of Africa, it should prohibit and thwart any other organization as well from performing any positive deed for Africa. The Cabora-Bassa project is in fact the largest, the most imaginative and the most comprehensive project ever developed for Africa and the people of Africa. It will bring immeasurable benefits to the whole of Central and Southern Africa and also to a large part of Hast Africa. It will change the lives of the people in those regions of Africa radically. It will bring about major improvements in the standard of living of every individual, regardless of colour, race or political convictions. The hydro-electric project will establish an inland lake 150 miles in length and will generate 17 000 million kilowatt-hours of power per year in comparison with the 10 000 million kilowatt-hours of the Aswan Dam. But this is only the first stage. More dams will be <span class="col_6845-6846" refersTo="page_0556"/>planned below Cabora-Bassa so that the whole Zambesi valley for 290 miles from there to the Indian Ocean will eventually be able to generate 50000 million kilowatt-hours of power per year. This will be the cheapest electric power in the whole of Africa.</p>

<p>But the generation of power and large-scale industrialization are not the only prospects. In addition the scheme embraces the development of 50 000 square miles of African soil on which the people of Africa can hardly make a living today. More than 6 million acres will become irrigable agricultural land on which crops such as grain, maize, fruit, sugar and cotton will grow luxuriantly. Timber will be planted on a further 600 000 acres so that a large-scale timber industry will be established in Africa as well. In addition, the Zambesi will be navigable from Tebe to the Indian Ocean. A new harbour will be built and an iron ore industry will be established there as a basis for further industrial development.</p>

<p>This, in broad outline, is the Cabora-Bassa development scheme. It is this gigantic development scheme for Africa and the people of Africa which President Kaunda and his organization have earmarked as the primary target for destruction. Their terrorists must ensure that no progress will be made with this work. It is difficult to understand how on earth this scheme can be labelled as a conspiracy against Africa and a crime against humanity. How President Kaunda and the Organization for African Unity can describe it as a racial, imperialistic and oppressive plot against Africa, goes beyond any normal logic. But it is clear that the Cabora-Bassa project is being condemned only because it is a project initiated and tackled by White Governments of Southern Africa, backed by international consortiums. If this scheme had been initiated by Moscow and Peking, the same as the Tanzam railway line, President Kaunda would have blessed and welcomed it. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think the hon. member for Algoa did a service when he emphasized today the virtues and the advantages of the Cabora-Bassa irrigation scheme. I had the privilege two years ago at the U.N. to hear some of the violent attacks upon this scheme from certain parties not without peculiar interests. It was quite clear that they were even willing to deny advantages and progress to the people in that part of Africa in order to serve their ideological ends and in order to further their hostility to those who govern the Southern part of Africa.</p>

<p>However, I do not wish to extend upon that thought today; I want to say something today about the problem of defending South Africa under the present Government in other parts of the world. I want to admit that I have limited experience of this, but I think the hon. the Minister should realize that when his political opponents face audiences and individuals in other parts of the world, they have a difficult task, because we do differ fundamentally from the Government in many of its attitudes and its policies. Yet, as South Africans, we are determined to see the very best possible interpretation is given to events in South Africa. I can say that it has been my experience and the experience of many others with whom I have discussed this matter, that there are two grounds upon which one can defend our country, South Africa, anywhere in the world today with success. The first is that one can affirm the sincerity of the Government in its attempts to find a solution for the problem of colour in South Africa. We may differ very strongly on the success, the practicability and the wisdom of this policy, but when our detractors from overseas allege in their propaganda that the Government is dishonest, insincere and deliberately deceptive in seeking to find a solution along the lines of what they call separate development or separate nationhood&#x2014; whatever the name may be, because it changes from time to time&#x2014;then our hackles rise and we can defend the Government and the people of South Africa against such insinuations. The other basis upon which we can defend South Africa is the fact that there still is in South Africa, although it may be limited in some respects, an essential and lively dialogue between South African and South African on what the solution is to our problems. I am confident that as long as we can go through the world as South Africans, no matter what our internal differences are and as long as we can use the very fact that those differences exist and exist on an organized basis, then the world has to think about South Africa again. Some of the sweeping generalizations they make <span class="col_6847-6848" refersTo="page_0557"/>about us cannot then be sustained. I think that the hon. the Minister and many hon. members on that side of the House will agree that here we have two weapons which even opponents of the Government can use in defence of South Africa.</p>

<p>That is why I regret the attack which the hon. the Minister made upon me yesterday, so deeply. He made this attack in reference to an article I wrote in the <i>Argus</i> on the 7th of this month and which appeared under the heading &#x201C;Dialogue at home too&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister may attack me for that article, he may differ from me; that is part of the dialogue which I believe to be one of the greatest virtues we still have in South Africa, and I will never resent it. For him to suggest, as he did yesterday, that I was taking my cue from an enemy of South Africa&#x2014;and he mentioned Emperor Haille Salassie&#x2014;I think is going a bit too far. I think it is unworthy of the hon. the Minister to say such a thing. Then he ended off his criticism of me&#x2014;and he is fully entitled to criticize me&#x2014;by suggesting that I wrote this article either in ignorance or else with a complete disregard of the truth, which means that I lied. That also surprised me. I think I should put on record in this House what my argument was in this particular article. I want to do this because I am not going to retract one word of it. I started with the words &#x201C;It is good news that Prime Minister Felix Houphouet-Boigny is taking the lead among the political heads of independent African States to initiate contact and discussion with the South African Government because we are worried about our isolation. I wish the Government well.&#x201D; Then I said that South Africa could play an important role in Africa by making our administrative, technical and scientific experience available to our near and distant neighbours, I said that they could become valuable friends if they used our resources for their own urgently needed development. Was there anything wrong with that? Of course, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>

<p>I went on and said the fact that we were facing virtually united criticism from many states of Africa was embarrassing some of our friends. I added that it would be better if there were also a dialogue amongst the African states about South Africa. Then I pointed out&#x2014; as the hon. the Prime Minister has conceded&#x2014;that some of the states who wanted to have a dialogue with us, did so in spite of the fact that they disapproved of our internal policy. They would in fact like to modify our internal policy through the dialogue. There is nothing wrong with that. Then I added&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Be that as it may; the United Party will support the Government in any progress it makes towards a genuine dialogue with these states. Only good can flow from it.</block>

<p>That is the point of view of this side of the House. We are grateful and we congratulate the Government on any progress they make towards establishing a dialogue with other countries of Africa, Then I went on and what I said then was apparently what upset the Government. I said we would like to have a more &#x201C;real dialogue&#x201D; with; our own non-White peoples in South Africa because we had a many-faceted problem in this country. Our problem is not only our relations with the other states in Africa. Our problem to a much more immediate degree is our relations with our own people of different colour in South Africa. I admit at once that we are all looking for a solution according to the light that we have received. The Government is looking for a solution; the hon. member for Houghton is looking for a solution; we are looking for a solution; and far he it from any one of us to be so arrogant as to claim that we have the omniscience to say today that our belief is the final and true answer to our problem.

I admit it is dialogue, but it is not real dialogue.</p>

<p>You do not conduct a dialogue with, for instance, the Indian people, if you talk only to a body which is appointed but not elected by them. That is not my idea of a real dialogue. You do not conduct a real dialogue with the Coloureds if you discuss matters only with the executive of a body in respect of which the will of the majority was frustrated by the appointment of Government nominees. I do not call that real dialogue. [Interjection.] My hon. friends opposite may think it is real dialogue, but I differ from them and I claim the right to do so. I shall continue to differ from them. You do not conduct a true dialogue with the African people if you consider that the tribal people, the people who have not yet broken their tribal bonds and have not yet accepted our money economy, alone represent the Black people of South Africa. That is, we believe, to live in a world of fantasy. That is the difference between us, and that difference will continue. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville will pardon me for not interfering in the dialogue he is conducting with the hon. the Minister. At the start I think it is necessary for us to refer to the opening words of the hon. member for Von Brandis, who took part in this debate a little earlier. The hon. member said the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint has always been that they believed we had a role to play in Africa. But what role does the United Party envisage we should play in Africa? I want to state this afternoon that this role they envisage, is best reflected in the words of Gen. Smuts in this same House in 1945 when he said, <i>inter alia</i>, 1he following about this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a surprisingly difficult task, the most difficult we can have to contend with. As yet we do not have a direction in this regard on the continent. We are still searching. We are still Voortrekkers and have not yet found our road.</block>

<p>He continued in this vein. But then he said&#x2014;and this is significant because I want to maintain that this is still the attitude of the United Party today&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not know whether we shall find a solution. Perhaps the question is insoluble and ties outside the reach of humanity with the outlook and the passionate religious feeling inspiring us at present.</block>

<p>This is still the attitude of the United Party today, an attitude of letting matters take their own course. If it does not work, they are prepared to go further and to say; &#x201C;We are prepared to sacrifice and sell the White man&#x201D;. In this regard we have had a very clear example this afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. S. J. GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am going to do that. This afternoon the hon. member for Bezuidenhout shamelessly disparaged the Prime Minister of the Republic of South Africa and placed him in juxtaposition to the Prime Minister of one of our northern neighbouring states, namely Kaunda. He played off our Prime Minister against that Prime Minister. He placed our Prime Minister in a bad light against that man, a man who has been proved, not by us, but by African states to be an extremely unreliable leader. He now becomes the great man in relation to our Prime Minister. This is the proof on which the hon. member for Turffontein asked me to substantiate my argument. The United Party says we should simply let matters take their own course and if this does not help, we shall simply sell the White man to the Blacks of Africa. The kind of speech made today by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does not serve to promote the success of this dialogue which is being conducted so successfully by our Prime Minister <span class="col_6851-6852" refersTo="page_0559"/>with our neighbouring states. It does not serve to contribute towards the success of this. In these circumstances, the Government is prepared to continue without their support as it has done in the past; it will continue to achieve success with that. As opposed to the attitude adopted by the United Party, the National Party Government has since the earliest times stood for stability and peaceful progress in Africa, in spite of the diminishing power of the West in Africa. I can furnish proof in this regard as well but there is no time for that. This has always been the standpoint of every successive National Party Government; therefore it is not something which originated recently. We feel that not only is this policy of the National Government of vital strategic importance, but also that under the leadership of the present Prime Minister and that of our very capable Minister of Foreign Affairs, this Government is achieving success in Africa,</p>

<p>It is precisely in the light of the success achieved in this field that I should like to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister and the Committee to a very strategically situated island. It is an island which, politically and economically, forms an inseparable part of the great African continent. I am referring to that beautiful island to which the hon. the Minister also referred yesterday, namely Mauritius, situated to the east of Madagascar. I say it is a beautiful island because it has a wonderful variety of flowers. This imparts beautiful colours to that island. There are the poinsettia, the frangipani, the bougainvillaea, etc. However, it is not only the flowers which attract one to that island. The island also has extensive sugar plantations, a fact to which I shall refer again later. However, it is an island which has great problems as well, problems which originated as a result of the carelessness and neglect by the people who were in power there before 1967. It was an imperialistic power which did the same there as they did in all the other African states over which they had control. In 1967 they left Mauritius to its fate. Overpopulation is one of the great problems of this small island. There are 750 000 people living on that little island while 90 per cent of its economy is dependent on the sugar industry. We know that the production of sugar is considerably higher than the demand for it. This fact creates certain problems. That island is fertile; it can produce that sugar and other things as well. For example, its rainfall is between 40 in. and 400 in. at certain places but sugar alone cannot assure it of a stable economy. This is one of its problems. It is true that it has had some tourism in recent times, which has helped a little. There is tea, to which the hon. the Minister referred yesterday, but all these things are not sufficient to bring it to its feet in the economic sphere. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the time has not come for some assistance to be given to this island, something which is perhaps slightly more substantial than the aid to which the hon. the Minister referred here yesterday. These people are pro-Western. For example, as the hon. the Minister said yesterday, they are not opposed to the sale of arms to South Africa. While their Minister of Foreign Affairs was a guest here in South Africa, he referred to the fact that they were anti-communistic. Furthermore, I can inform you. Sir, that we have landing rights for our aircraft at Mauritius en route to Australia. They are favourably disposed towards us and any form of economic help we can give them, will eventually mean that we would be helping ourselves. Hon. members may perhaps rightly ask in what way that aid could be given. I want to ask whether greater use of the tremendous labour potential cannot be made locally, i.e. on the island itself. Is it not possible that some of our raw material may be exported there, so that it could be processed there and then be imported here again? In saying this, Sir, hon. members must not presume that we have any imperialistic plans in that regard. We want to say to them that we are in favour of the freedom they have achieved and that what we really want to do must serve only to help them further along that road. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it may perhaps serve a useful purpose if I react at this stage to certain statements which were made here and questions which were put to me. In the first place I want to refer to the idea expressed by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that we should start training non-Whites who should subsequently enter the Diplomatic Service and act as ambassadors and diplomats. As hon. members know, as many non-Whites as possible are being trained for various posts in the administration <span class="col_6853-6854" refersTo="page_0560"/>of their own affairs in their areas. There is still a large backlog, and the training of diplomats is not possible at this stage. The facilities are not there, and there are quite a number of other matters which should receive priority, in view of the large backlog.</p>

<p>The hon. member expressed disappointment at my not having said something more concrete in regard to the possible dialogue with Africa. But, Sir, this is a very delicate matter. I said everything which in my opinion should at this stage have been said by me as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the light of the confidential information at my disposal. I do not know on what the hon. member bases his conclusions that the ball is now in our court and that we must react now. My statement yesterday evening actually amounted to a plea that we should not cloud the issue with unnecessary speculation and untimeous, wild statements. Surely no one expects the South African Government to noise abroad everything we do or do not do and everything we are planning. Surely to do that would be very clumsy. The hon. member for Von Brandis will confirm that that is not the way diplomacy is conducted. After all, one does not lay all one&#x2019;s cards on the table when the situation is such a delicate one. All that hon. members are doing by continuing to discuss this matter, is to make President Boigny&#x2019;s task more difficult.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout again had quite a lot to say about our policy of separate development and its application. He maintained that the multinational character of our country was not being brought to the attention of the outside world. But surely that is not correct.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is not reflected in this Parliament either. We as Whiles are governing this country, while we are leading the non-White peoples living in this country to self-determination, to some or other form of self-government, and until such time as that comes about. South Africa will be represented abroad by those who today comprise the Government of this country. A country is represented abroad by those who are in power, and no country which is not sovereign is represented abroad. If the hon. member thinks that we should appoint non-Whites in our overseas missions, then I must remind him that this has been tried by others, but without success. The hon. member himself used the expression &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;. That is precisely what would happen if we were to employ non-Whites in that capacity. I must remind the hon. member that virtually every important visitor to South Africa pays a visit to the Transkei and to other homelands, to the educational institutions for the Coloured and other non-White peoples, and must in fact take thorough cognizance of the multi-national character of our country.</p>

<p>The hon. member accused me of attributing the opposition to our policy solely to a misconception of it. But that is not the case at all. I realize that there are many other reasons as well why criticism is being levelled at our policy. I realize, perhaps more than anyone else, how much criticism there is in the world, of separate development, or rather the caricature of apartheid, presented there, and how much opposition there is to it. But we are prepared to pay that price. We are not striving after popularity. Our purpose is to ensure the survival of the White people as well as the other peoples in South Africa. Popularity is not what we are seeking. No nation in the world has ever voluntarily relinquished its right of survival. May it never be said of us that we were the first nation in history that was prepared to do so. The hon. the Opposition seems to think that the solution to our population problem and the effect it <span class="col_6855-6856" refersTo="page_0561"/>has on the outside world, as the hon. member for Yeoville rightly admitted, lies in compromise, in concessions. We on this side believe that the solution lies in our policy, and that the progress we make with its application will be the solution to that particular problem.</p>

<p>Your entire policy is a concession.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>We do not think these onslaughts will continue. We think that the unfavourable aspects, the way in which our policy is sometimes applied, which people do not like and which we ourselves do not like, will gradually diminish and that the positive side of our policy will become more and more apparent. That will not happen as a result of a watering down of our policy, but as a result of the consistent application thereof. I want to say that I agree with the hon. member when he states that more criticism is being levelled at what may be termed the so-called exceptional cases, and that less and less criticism is being levelled at our broad policy. As far as criticism is concerned, our broad policy is receding into the background more and more. These exceptional cases cannot simply be eliminated overnight. They are due to the fact that the policy has to be applied by fallible human beings. They are the result of errors of judgment made by people. They are due to the fact that people who have to exercise their discretion, do so incorrectly. Sometimes they are due to discourtesy or sheer rudeness. The Government has through legislation restricted the points of friction which can be caused, and which can lead to these situations, to a minimum. In actual fact those exceptional cases are already very few in number. We in the Government do not tolerate anyone who acts in a manner that may lead to friction. We take strong action against such persons. Even if there are foreigners who are guilty of conduct which can lead to friction between the various peoples, we take action against them. Sometimes the matter is then taken further by the representatives of the countries from which the persons in question came. When that happens, we often have very frank discussions with the ambassador of the country in question.</p>

<p>I recently had a long and very frank discussion with the American ambassador in regard to the cancellation of certain residence permits of American citizens in this country. I trust that after that discussion he has more clarity on the matter and possibly a greater appreciation of our actions. However, there are those who are not interested in our actions and in our motivations. There are those who will not be satisfied until the policy of one man, one vote is applied in this country. Neither apartheid nor a race federation nor the franchise on the basis of merit will satisfy those people, as the hon. member for Yeoville said in this House in 1969. Hon. members who return time and again with accusations against apartheid would do well to read that Hansard of the Transvaal leader of their party to see what he said. I shall give them the reference.</p>

<p>Sir, sometimes we too become enmeshed in the snares and toils of international power politics. Sometimes we are not judged according to our merits. We are condemned in the light of how those actions affect the broader political objectives. In this world South Africa is proceeding with great circumspection and trying to find its way and is in fact succeeding.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to a visa case and to an alleged statement made by a representative attached to one of our missions abroad. I know about the case. I know that this visa was not refused. It was not possible to refuse it, because there was no application. All that happened was that information was requested. The applicant was told that the application would have to be referred to South Africa and that the decision would have to be taken there. The person in question then decided not to submit an application. Where the story has its origin, I therefore cannot say.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, he was never told why he could not come. The application was never dealt with. I deny that allegation of his; my people never said that to him. Our representatives did not say that to him. All that he was told was that if he made application they would not <span class="col_6857-6858" refersTo="page_0562"/>be able to give him an immediate reply; it would have to be referred to South Africa.</p>

<p>To return to the matter of the dialogue, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to the objective of certain Africa leaders, as appears from their public statements, to break down South Africa and our policy of separate development. I already discussed that in my introductory speech. I pleaded that we should view those statements in their true perspective. I do not think I should say anything further about the matter.</p>

<p>Reference was again made in the debate this afternoon to the Lusaka Manifesto. I referred to it in this House two years ago as well. I mentioned and emphasized its positive aspects, but now I must add at once that there are certain parts of the Lusaka Manifesto which cannot be reconciled with these positive aspects. Unfortunately that is the case. It is also true, I admit, that the Western powers are inclined to emphasize the positive aspects of the Lusaka Manifesto and to close their eyes to the negative part. There are quite a number of leaders in Africa who also fix their gaze on the positive, constructive parts and ignore the other parts. But I think our position in this connection is quite clear. The hon. the Prime Minister and I have already stated our attitude in regard to the dialogue as completely as I think we ought to state it at this stage, for we have dealt with our willingness to conduct a dialogue with African leaders and I do not think I should say anything further about it at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis correctly stated, and one appreciates this, that both parties are in favour of the outward movement. But then he went too far. He tried to get the credit for it for his party by referring to the fact that Gen. Smuts had moved outwards in 1929, but he is an ex-member of my Department of Foreign Affairs, and I am sorry to say that his memory has failed him in this regard, for the outward movement actually began in 1927, when the late Gen. Hertzog established the Department of Foreign Affairs. Without it the outward policy would not have been possible, and of course this policy is not limited to Africa alone, but applies to the rest of the world as well, [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the hon. member for Yeoville. Just as in 1969, when he made a good speech in this House, he started off on a high note, and I want to thank him for the positive contributions and the observations he made here. It is true that it is stated in the article that the Opposition welcome the developments in Africa and that they are in favour of the dialogue idea. But now he comes along at this critical stage, one of the most important junctures in regard to our relations with the outside world which we have had in many years. This is a juncture at which everything which is said in this Parliament by us on this side, by the hon. members on the opposite side, by me and by the hon. the Prime Minister, is being most closely scrutinized Now the hon. member comes along at this juncture and blazons it abroad to the entire world that there is no true dialogue here among us. That may be his opinion, to which is entitled in a free, democratic country, where we conduct a dialogue on matters in regard to which we disagree. But it so happens that it is not the opinion of the large majority of members in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Von Brandis referred to South Africa's programme for the enrichment of uranium. Before I come to his question in this regard, I would like to reiterate what has on previous occasions been categorically stated by the Prime Minister, namely that as far as our programme is concerned, South Africa is interested in uranium solely for peaceful purposes. The hon. member has put two questions to me in connection with the peaceful uses of atomic energy; firstly he wanted to know what progress had been made in <span class="col_6859-6860" refersTo="page_0563"/>connection with the non-proliferation treaty and secondly what progress has been made in establishing safeguards. These two questions are, of course, interrelated as indicated in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement when he dealt with South Africa&#x2019;s uranium enrichment project in this House last year. The hon. member quite rightly last night quoted this part of the Prime Minister's statement. To deal with the non-proliferation treaty first: According to our latest information just over 100 countries have signed the treaty and approximately 55 have ratified it. At this stage we should be guided more by the number of ratifications. Only when a country has ratified the agreement, does it become a party therto. The treaty came into force on 5th March last year, after the required 43 countries including the three depositing powers, namely the U S.A., Soviet Russia and the United Kingdom, had ratified it. Amongst the ratifying countries are the three already mentioned and Canada, Formosa, Denmark, Ethiopia. Greece, Mexico, Sweden, Ireland. Finland, Norway, Botswana, Poland, Austria, New Zealand, Iraq, Swaziland, Iran, Peru. Malaysia and Czechoslovakia. A number of countries important in the field of nuclear energy either as producers of uranium or in technology have so far not taken any action in regard to the non-proliferation treaty. Among these are Australia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Spain, Portugal, France and Communist China.</p>

<p>Coming to the second question concerning what progress has been made in establishing a pattern of safeguards, I may mention that the committee which was established by the Atomic Energy Agency for this purpose recently submitted what may be called &#x201C;guidelines&#x201D; for future safeguard agreements with member states. These guidelines were subsequently approved by the Executive Board of the Agency and will now be considered by the general conference of the Agency. I must stress that these are guidelines only and not the text of control agreements to be concluded with member states. When this matter was considered by the board, South Africa&#x2019;s representative reaffirmed once again our standpoint that the question of our future possible accession to the non-proliferation treaty would be assessed once the controls to be applied had been formulated in the text of actual draft agreements and once it was clear whether there was to be any differentiation between regional groups and individual states.</p>

When the hon. the Minister deals with the non-proliferation treaty and the short list of countries, including Australia, France and South Africa, which are not yet participating in the non-proliferation treaty, may I ask whether any of these countries have actually signed the treaty without ratification?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, they have not.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Von Brandis as well as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout spoke of a Pretoria manifesto which we should issue. This idea was also raised by a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, viz. Prof, Mike Louw. I already referred to it in the debate last year. I pointed out at the time that what ought to be included in such a manifesto should in fact already be crystal clear to everyone. Our Africa policy is clear. It has been repeatedly stated. I really do not know what the hon. members envisage including in such a manifesto. The possibility that we could explain our policy in respect of South-West Africa in such a Pretoria manifesto was mentioned. In regard to that as well, there is probably no uncertainty in the world.</p>

<p>This has reminded me that I must comment on and rectify a certain matter arising from a report which, appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 25th April of a speech made in South-West Africa by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. I do not want to discuss South-West Africa in this debate. I think we have rightly avoided that subject in the past. At the moment we are of course awaiting the opinion by the International Court. I also hope that the fact that I am now going to refer to this report will not lead to a discussion of our case which is before the International Court of Justice and the merits of that case. But I am forced to try to rectify certain matters which emerged from this report. I do not know whether the report is correct. Firstly, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout alleged, according to the report, that the plebiscite <span class="col_6861-6862" refersTo="page_0564"/>which the legal team proposed before the court would amount to a rejection of the Odendaal Report because, according to that proposal, all the inhabitants of the area would vote together and not as inhabitants of the separate homelands. That is how the report reads. I have it with me. But that is by no means the presumption in regard to this plebiscite proposal which was put to the court. The plebiscite proposal implies precisely the opposite. Its object is to determine whether the inhabitants want the South African Government to continue to administer South-West Africa, as we are doing at the moment, according to the recommendations of the Odendaal Report. Our administration is based on the development of the various homelands. They will have to decide whether they want us to continue with the administration according to the Odendaal Report or whether they prefer the U.N. administration, which wants to administer the Territory as an integrated whole.</p>

<p>But they vote on a unitary basis.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am coming to that. A further object of the proposal made by the legal team is to prove that the accusation that South Africa&#x2019;s administration leads to the suppression of the inhabitants of South-West Africa is completely unfounded, by affording the inhabitants an opportunity of choosing for themselves. According to that Press report the hon. member for Bezuidenhont said uhat it implied that both sides would have to put their case, which in turn implied an invitation to the U.N. to come to South-West Africa and put its case there or to participate there&#x2014;I do not know what they must come and do there. I now want to inform the hon. member that this entire proposal of South Africa in regard to a plebiscite is still under consideration by the court. That is why I do not think it could serve any good purpose if we were to discuss it now, I say this in the light of the fact that South Africa&#x2019;s representative said in the court:</p>

<block name="quote">The detailed procedures are to be a matter for discussion and agreement between the court and the South African Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, nothing has been decided yet, nothing concrete has been proposed yet; no details have been proposed yet. Therefore I do not think it would be a good thing if we were to discuss that matter now.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a great pity the hon. member could not resist the temptation, but I am coming to that. I want to go further, because the hon. member also made other statements to which I must object. The fact of the matter is that the U.N. was never mentioned in this plebiscite proposal. It was to be a matter between South Africa and the court, if the court accepted it. I want to repeat, therefore, that the plebiscite proposal does not mean or presuppose that the Government&#x2019;s policy is a deviation from the Odendaal Report, The second statement which was attributed to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout related to the status of South-West Africa. According to this report the hon. member alleged that there was or might be a change on the part of the Government in respect of its attitude to the status of South-West Africa. To prove that, the hon. member quoted a phrase I used at the U.N. when I referred to the &#x201C;separate international status&#x201D; of the Territory, This same matter was also raised in this House by the same member in 1967, I want to quote in full what I said at the time. I am doing this for the record and for the information of the hon. members. The hon. member asked at the time whether the statement I had made at the United Nations was not inconsistent with my statement in this House on the separate international status, identity or character of South-West Africa. I used all three these words. There are no inconsistencies, and I want to quote from Hansard of 1967 (column 4575 of 20th April):</p>

<block name="quote">However, we must have absolute clarity as to what is meant by these words. In the past our adversaries in international politics contended that South-West Africa had an international status, but <span class="col_6863-6864" refersTo="page_0565"/>then they interpreted that concept as including accountability on the part of South Africa to the world and to the United Nations in particular. That, of course, we have consistently denied most emphatically. We deny that South-West Africa has any international status or identity in the sense in which they use these words, and I think the hon. Deputy Minister&#x2019;s interjection referred to this [that was Deputy Minister Van der Wath]. We have never disputed the fact that, internationally speaking, South-West Africa has a separate identity or character or status, in the sense that South-West Africa is separate from South Africa in international law and has not been incorporated by South Africa &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is not all. According to this report the hon. member sought further proof for this statement of his. He found it in the memorandum issued in 1968 under the title &#x201C;Decisions by the Government on the Financial and Administrative Relations between the Republic and South-West Africa&#x201D;. To prove his statement he quoted the following words:</p>

<block name="quote">Therefore there could be no question of incorporation or a change in the Territory&#x2019;s status.</block>

<p>If one reads the entire sentence, however, it is a completely different matter. That is what I want to do. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the Prime Minister announced the proposed reorganization in Windhoek in August, 1967, he emphasized that it was completely legal and in accordance with the spirit of the former mandate in terms of which the Government of South Africa was granted full powers of administration and legislation over the Territory as an integral part of South Africa and that there could therefore be no question of incorporation or a change in the Territory&#x2019;s separate international status.</block>

<p>All that this means is that these readjustments did not amount to incorporation. I hope the impression created by this report in the Press is not correct. If it is wrong, I hope the hon. member will correct it. The hon. member said that he was speaking at a political meeting. Now I find it very regrettable that a particularly contentious matter such as this, in spite of the fact that I had already given an explanation four years ago in respect of the second part, should have been broached at a public meeting.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with a great deal of interest to the two statements made by the hon. the Minister, and I must say that I agree with part of what he said in his last reply to the debate, namely that no point would be served by issuing a Pretoria minfesto on South Africa&#x2019;s general policy. I do not think there is any merit in the suggestion which has been made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, for reasons which I will give in a minute. I note that the Minister however is favourably inclined to issuing a Pretoria manifesto as far as South-West Africa is concerned. I think that could probably be useful, because there is a good deal of misunderstanding about South Africa&#x2019;s attitude. So much has gone on over the years&#x2014;I think it has all been lost in the flood waters of cases, arguments and decisions that have been handed down. But I cannot see any point in issuing a Pretoria manifesto as far as our general policy is concerned. Pretoria has done nothing but issue manifestos. Every statement is makes on general policy could be called a Pretoria manifesto. The point is that the Government has convinced itself that it can present an ethical solution to the racial problems of South Africa. It presents this ethical solution almost as if it is replying to at least the first part of the Lusaka manifesto. The first part of that Lusaka manifesto stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that all men have the right and the duty to participate as equal members of society in their own government.</block>

<p><span class="col_6865-6866" refersTo="page_0566"/>That is precisely what this Government thinks it is doing. It believes that it is, as the hon. the Minister has said this afternoon, leading the non-White people towards their own identity and fulfilment in their own homelands, and eventually to their own government. But this statement of faith, this ethical concept, which was issued in fact long before the Lusaka manifesto came into being, for that was only a couple of years ago, has been issued year after year since Dr. Verwoerd first framed this ethical solution. But it does not wash; it is no good. Sir. It does not help us in the outside world&#x2014;because however much the Government may protest that it is its desire to give men equal rights in their own homelands and that it is against discrimination because it is going to allow the African people to realize themselves in their own homelands, the world is left with the stark reality, with the fact that more than half of the African people live in White South Africa. It is on those people that attention is focussed. I am now speaking about those eight million Africans who are living inside the so- called White areas of the Republic and also of course the two million Coloured peple and the 500 000 Indians. Until the Government comes forward with an answer to this, there is no point in issuing manifestos.</p>

<p>We have a better answer than your party.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think you have. You talk about &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; in the homelands, but the eight million people who are never going to put a foot in the homelands have no vote of any value whatsoever. I think that if today on gives the Africans a free choice of whether they would accept being citizens in a multi-racial South Africa where all discrimination has been removed, with rights in this Parliament on a qualified franchise basis, represented on a common roll by people of all races, they would accept it because the other part of the policy is always forgotten, namely that of opening the opportunities to acquire the qualifications. This choice has never been given to the Africans. They have been told what the Government offers them and that is what they are stuck with. The hon. the Minister is now taking a different attitude to the Lusaka manifesto from that which he took two years ago. I raised this Lusaka manifesto question during the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote and the hon. the Minister referred me to a debate which had taken place in this House in May, 1969, I took the trouble to look up the reference he so kindly supplied to me. Interestingly enough there were only two references there. One was a speech made by the then member for Krugersdorp who eulogized the Lusaka manifesto almost as if it was an expression of National Party policy. He was thinking in term of each African homeland with its own government and not in terms of a minority White regime in South Africa at all. He was convinced that we could put over this idea to the African states. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference was very brief indeed and occupies less than a page in Hansard. He had only favourable comments to make about the Lusaka manifesto at that stage. He pointed to the modesty with which the African States had presented themselves and he pointed to the fact that they did not want to replace White racialism with Balck racialism. He mentioned this in passing and went on to say that they would rather &#x201C;talk than kill&#x201D; and that they would rather have a peaceful solution to Southern Africa&#x2019;s dilemma. It is not only South Africa that concerns them but also Rhodesia and the Portuguese-occupied territories in East and West Africa. Today he had a very different attitude. Today he says, correctly, that one must not only look at that side of the Lusaka manifesto and that there are other less favourable aspects of this manifesto. This is precisely the point I want to make. We must not start things we cannot finish. The Minister must remember that the African states with whom he wants dialogue&#x2014;this hideously overworked word&#x2014;are all coming in terms of them interpretation of the Lusaka manifesto, which is if Peaceful negotiation does not work and if they cannot persuade the South African Government of the error of its ways and that it must change its attitude towards the Black majority and race discrimination inside White South Africa, not in terms of the homeland policy, then they would have no alternative but to back the liberation movement. Surely this is also the real message of the Lusaka manifesto, namely, that <span class="col_6867-6868" refersTo="page_0567"/>unless we are prepared to make meaningful changes, they are all going to turn their backs on us. It is not only the Zambian president and the president of Tanzania, but also those people who have spoken about dialogue with us who are coming to talk in terms of the Lusaka manifesto. I hope that this fact is fully realized, because to start raising expectations can often be a very dangerous thing, because if those expectations are not realized, the hostility towards South Africa will be greater than it has ever been before. The President of the Ivory Coast made a very interesting statement the other day. President Houphouet-Boigny stated in an interview that &#x201C;we should invade South Africa with out diplomats&#x201D;. He said:</p>

<block name="quote">What would happen to apartheid if 30 or 40 Black nations had embassies in South Africa and the Black diplomats would have to be allowed to go into White cinemas and restaurants? It would be the end of apartheid.</block>

<p>I wish that were true; I wish it were as simple as that. Sir: If we had a handful of Black diplomats&#x2014;because 30 or 40 people really represent a handful in a country with a population of 21 million people if we had a handful of Black diplomats who were allowed all the privileges of White citizenship in South Africa, that would mean the end of apartheid. It will not, and I hope that the hon. the Minister realizes that this dialogue is not going to be a simple matter of explaining his interpretation of the Lusaka Manifesto, namely that South Africa indeed is not practising race discrimination, that White South Africa is not a minority Government because there are X numbers of White people outnumbering the Zulu race, the Swazi race, the Basotho race and so on. It is just not going to work. Sir, I see our dilemma of policy in Africa as something much more complicated than that, because we are trying to do two mutually incompatible things, two completely incompatible things. On the one hand we talk about increasing contacts and diplomatic relations and so on and on the other hand South Africa is taking the part of the White r&#x00E9;gimes. This has been its policy all along. It is supporting the Rhodesian r&#x00E9;gime, which is very much objected to in the Lusaka Manifesto.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that I have always been against the U.D.I. government. South Africa is also supporting the White r&#x00E9;gime of Portugal in Africa. Those just happen to be mutually incompatible because all the Black states are against this. This is the difficulty which is now facing other nations outside Africa. They see this conflict developing and they have to make their choice as to whether they are going to come in with White South Africa and thereby find themselves aligned on the side of minority regimes like Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonial governments in Angola and in East Africa, as against the whole of Black Africa. These are the problems which are facing the other countries. We have the same things that we had in microcosm in the sports policy. In other words, do they allow South African teams to come over and to compete and thus apparently align themselves with White South Africa against their own Black Commonwealth nations? It is very difficult to start something, Sir, unless you are prepared to complete it, and this is what we have done in the case of the sports policy. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>&#x2022;Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. S. D. ERASMUS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton always takes delight in putting forward the standpoint of international ideology. I want to tell her that she may rest assured that our standpoint is an ethical one and that we shall continue to put it forward without making concessions, but it is also a fact that we are making progress slowly but surely and that we shall eventually have the co-operation of the world and that they will recognize our honesty.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to refer to what the hon. member for Von Brandis said here. He said he was referring to a report of Mr. Newson, of America, in which he said that America was looking at the urban Bantu and that this was the crux of the matter on which they judge us. Sir, I want to tell him that that is not all; there are many other views held in America. The same Mr. Newsom made a speech at the North Western University in Illinois. There he put forward four standpoints the U.S.A. could adopt towards South Africa, but he went further; his basic standpoint was that legislation <span class="col_6869-6870" refersTo="page_0568"/>in South Africa is based on discrimination which is a problem in the U.N. and the world at present; that it is a system which carries within itself the seed of enormous racial explosions and which may mean problems for America. He then continued and said that there were four ways open to the United States to follow in South Africa. The first way open to America, is the one of accepting apartheid; the second is the isolation of South Africa; the third is deliverance from the situation, in other words, the elimination of apartheid; and the fourth is communication with South Africa. The first way, that of accepting apartheid, he rejected on three grounds. He said that if America were to accept the situation here, it would not be consistent with its own efforts of maintaining racial harmony within that country; secondly, he said that if they were to accept this situation, the United States of America would lose its <i>bona fides</i> among the African states. Thirdly, the United States would not be in a position to offer effective resistance to communist infiltration in Africa and America would then have associated itself with the White states in Southern Africa. The second way, i.e. the elimination of apartheid he did not pursue, because he said it entails violence and that this may endanger world peace. The third way, i.e. that of isolation, he also rejected. To him isolation means the severing of all diplomatic relations as well as prohibiting any investments, and this he rejected by virtue of the fact that if the U.S.A. withdrew from here, other investors would move in to take its place here. He then dealt with the fourth way, i.e, communication with South Africa, and he said that he accepted it. They want to communicate, with us, but emphasize that communication does not mean lifting the arms embargo; it does not mean the acceptance of the domestic situation of apartheid either. He says it only means that the two parties would then know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>Sir, this speech is very interesting. I believe this gives us the actual standpoint adopted by the State Department; it also goes to show how people jump at nonessential things and do not see the essential things, and how they elevate the nonessential things to major policy formulating factors. I believe these misconceptions are marring relations between our two countries. It actually promotes communism and weakens the position of the United States even here in Africa. I am quite sure. Sir, that the relations between our two countries will improve greatly provided a few matters are faced more realistically. The United States, whether she wants to admit it or not, is today destined to be the protector of the Christian world, because of the enormous power it has in all spheres. If the United States of America were to go under, communism would dominate and suppress the rest of the world. Today communism is moving step by step towards Africa, in Africa and around Africa, and if Africa should go under, America would come under great pressure, because one of its flanks would he completely exposed. But, Sir, it is also true that if South Africa should go under, communism would role up Africa as it would do with a pan-cake, but as long as the Republic remains standing, Africa will also be able to remain standing. I believe the time has come for the United States to make a reappraisal of its attitude towards South Africa, and for the beautiful example set by prominent Americans, as well as the American Ambassador, Mr. Hurd, to be followed. Mr. Hurd, for example, emphasized points of agreement between our two countries when he addressed the press at a meeting in Johannesburg on 23rd November. He pointed out how much the two countries have in common. Mr. Newsom may for example put it to the American people that we are two nations which are really devoted to the Christian way of life; secondly, that the domestic political circumstances within South Africa and within the United States have no bearing on one another&#x2014;one cannot compare the two; thirdly, it may be put to America that our domestic legislation is not based on discrimination in respect of colour and race. Our legislation is based on the preservation of the individual identity of all nations&#x2014;it is the basic foundation of our legislation. I believe that if the American people realize these things as we do, if they know that we are striving as sincerely as they are to do the best for our people, and that we want to uplift our people and assist and guide them towards self realization they will realize that separate development is not the danger to world peace which people make it out to be. These are not only our words; we have heard here today that President Boigny himself emphasized that communism is more dangerous than separate development. Separate development is our way of life. <span class="col_6871-6872" refersTo="page_0569"/>It is our way of doing things. It is not something which is exported, and more and more states in Africa accept the fact that it is South Africa&#x2019;s domestic affair. If they accept that this is not a barrier to cordial co-operation between us and them, why should America then regard it as a barrier? I believe that it is an exaggeration to say that America would lose its <i>bona fides</i> among the African states if it cooperates with us.</p>

<p>Surely it is also the stated policy of the United States that if there are nations striving for their own realization and independence, they should be assisted in achieving that. Therefore, our policy must from the nature of things and exclusively be acceptable to them. I believe time is running out. I believe the hand of the clock for the Christian people in the world is pointing to ten to twelve. To those of us who adhere to this tenet, time is running out. Knowing the American people as I do, I believe that if they are aware of all these facts they will believe that there must be closer and more co-operation between our two nations. I believe we should be able to agree to differ with each other but that we have to realize that the security of South Africa is the security of the United States of America too. Whether we want to do so or not, we shall be compelled to rely on each other in the future. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to tell the hon. member for Pietersburg that I agree with him that communism is a great danger and that we must stand firm. I just want to express the hope that he is correct in saying that when the dialogue starts, the African states are sure to accept the domestic situation in South Africa and our domestic policy. I hope this will not be an obstacle. All of us in this House believe that the Department of Foreign Affairs is a very important department, and that the hon. the Minister occupies a key position. It is the aim of everyone to strengthen South Africa&#x2019;s position internationally. However, it is the Oppostion&#x2019;s role&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this&#x2014; to scrutinize the policy and the actions of this hon. Minister in the field of foreign affairs, and if we see dangers for South Africa in his and his Government&#x2019;s policy, it is our duty to sound a note of warning.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that in the modern world of today it is necessary for him to give his Cabinet a clear, firm and very decisive lead as regards international affairs. It is not correct to leave international affairs to politicians. It is the field of a statesman, and therefore I want to declare that South Africa&#x2019;s position in relation to the rest of Africa will, in the last resort, depend on its relations with Africa. Consequently we were amazed that the hon. the Minister had not vetoed the unfortunate action of the hon. the Prime Minister in respect of President Kaunda. This hon. Minister knows that international negotiations are strictly confidential. We all saw on the photostatic copy of one of the letters sent to our hon. Prime Minister by the President of Zambia that it was clearly marked &#x201C;Secret&#x201D;.</p>

I am sorry to say that this whole piece of play-acting of the hon. the Prime Minister is a consequence of the decades of brain-washing and propaganda which resulted in the superior and arrogant attitude typical of this Government. [Interjections.] This behaviour towards President Kaunda is just a projection of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s line of action in respect of our own non-Whites in South Africa. You all know that the President of the Ivory Coast has intimated that he wants to conduct a dialogue with South Africa, as have other leaders of Black Africa. Sir, you will be able to confirm that the main theme in the council chambers of Black African countries will be the following: Be careful of the Government <span class="col_6873-6874" refersTo="page_0570"/>in Pretoria, for if you fall into disfavour with them, they will reveal your closest secrets.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to say this. The relations between South Africa and the future independent states to be created within our borders if this Government stays in power long enough will be South Africa&#x2019;s most important relations with other states. And the debacle of the Minister of Bantu Administration in respect of Chief Matanzima is another matter that should have been prevented by this hon. Minister. These are the two areas in which he has failed to prevent our relations from being clouded by politicians. He should have used his influence in this connection in order to have statesmanship prevail.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. A. PIENAAR</person>:</from>

<p>While listening to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, I once more gained the impression that the Opposition got such a hiding during the debate on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, and that they became so aware of the fact that they struck a poor figure during that debate, that they are now trying to come along wih a rearguard acion in connection with President Kaunda. They now come along with stories they subsequently learned from the Press. The Press told them how they should actually have conducted themselves here in the House. Now we hear things such as those we have just heard from the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. I regret to say that these matters were also mentioned this afternoon by front-benchers of the Opposition. It amazes me that these gentlemen allow themselves to be used as lackeys of the English- language Press.</p>

<p>However, I want to make a few further remarks here. I want to state that there is a growing awareness, not only among our people in the leadership group, in Parliament and among our intelligentsia, but also among the masses, at all levels of society, including our factory workers and merchants, that we are a part of Africa and that we must take up and maintain our position in the statehood of African nations. It is not only in the political sphere that there is this growing awareness, but also in the international commercial sphere. I maintain that there are two factors, in particular, that are going to force us increasingly in the future to think in terms of our position in Africa and Africa alone. This is, it would seem to me, the approaching entry of Britain into the European Common Market, which is going to create many problems for us as far as the development and exploitation of our present markets in Britain are concerned. The other aspect, which is going to have a considerably adverse effect on us, and which is going to make us increasingly more dependent on Africa as our commercial hinterland, is the ever-increasing freight. Freight has increased in recent times by almost 20 per cent, while it is predicted that in the near future&#x2014;in the next five years&#x2014;it is going to increase by another 50 per cent. I now maintain that our lines of communication are actually becoming longer and more expensive because of the increased costs, in spite of this century in which everything has drawn closer together. It is therefore my view that we are going to depend increasingly on our relations with Africa.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is also an awareness among our Black African neighbours that we, White South Africa, are also a part of Africa. We can trace this back to the remarks President Boigny made recently, but also, for example, in the Lusaka Manifesto where it is expressly stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We believe that all the peoples who have made their home in the countries of Southern Africa are Africans regardless of the colour of their skin and we would oppose a racialist majority Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>We therefore find that even among these peoples there is an awareness of the fact that we are not only colonial settlers, but that we belong to Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_6875-6876" refersTo="page_0571"/>The political and economic position of our neighbours in Black Africa is also of the utmost importance to us, A relationship with an unstable friend can be frustrating. Good relations&#x2014;and it will suit us all the more to have good relations with Black Africa&#x2014;can only be arranged with stable countries. It is therefore in our interests for the independent Black Slates to be politically and economically stable. In the past decade we have seen the evolution &#x2014;or revolution as some call it&#x2014;of the emerging Black States, and we have seen how they have established their political basis. Let us make no mistake, the Black political leaders of Africa are competent; we must not underestimate them, much less the strength of their countries. It befits us as White Africans, if I may use the term, to display the necessary respect towards those Black leaders.</p>

<p>However capable these leaders may be, I must say that they are going to be confronted increasingly by the problem of the promotion of economic activities within their country&#x2019;s borders. They are going to be confronted increasingly with the supplying of sufficient food, employment opportunities and generally better living conditions for their people. This is going to set them a tremendous challenge in the future. If the leaders do not succeed in letting the economic growth keep pace with population growth, this must lead to unemployment, poverty and even famine. Such a situation must give rise to undesirable political instability and I maintain that that is not in our interests. One is then grateful to note that, after a period of initial unrest and even economic chaos, a measure of stability has come to many of the Black African States, with a measure of progress in countries such as Ghana and the Kinshasa Congo. Unfortunately it is also true that the economic growth rate in numerous African States is particularly low and has not kept pace with the population growth. Only a few countries could keep their heads above water to any extent. I want to quote a few facts that are mentioned in The Economic Commission for Africa and African Economic Indicators, 1968. Only a few countries, for example Libya, Mauritania, Malawi, the Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone evidenced an increase of 3 per cent or more in their production <i>per capita.</i> In Tunisia, Egypt, Togo and Mauritius the growth rate was more than 2 per cent, but less than 3 per cent per annum. In nineteen African countries the economic growth rate was less than I per cent per year, and in 13 of these countries <i>per capita</i> incomes decreased. With the exception of South Africa, there were only two countries in 1966, i.e. Libya and Gabon, where the income <i>per capita</i> exceeded R220 per year. In five countries the <i>per capita</i> incomes varied between R140 and R220, while in 18 African countries it was less than R70 <i>per capita</i> per annum. As far as the population growth is concerned, I can just mention to hon. members that Tanzania, for example, maintained an economic growth rate of about 5 per cent per annum during the 1964-&#x2019;69 development plan period. However, since the country&#x2019;s population increased by 2,7 per cent and prices evidenced an increase of 2,5 per cent per annum, the real income <i>per capita.</i> decreased, or at best stagnated. Hon. members will therefore see that these countries are faced with a tremendous problem. South Africa is sympathetic towards them in their problems. Like them, we also had to wrench ourselves free from a colonial economy that was more intent on administrative and military objects than on economic ones. We made our adjustments. Like them, we also had to wrench ourselves free of an agriculturally-bound economy and we had to develop into an industrial economy. Like them, we must also struggle with the urbanization of our population. We are also equipped with the necessary experience, in my opinion, to give these countries the necessary guidance in this sphere. This guidance is also, in my opinion, an extension of our African policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by thanking the hon. the Minister for his courtesy in dealing with a question which I raised last night and was unable to complete. I appreciate his consideration in replying fully to this question.</p>

<p><span class="col_6877-6878" refersTo="page_0572"/>I hope he will forgive me, therefore, if I refer to what might be described perhaps as his &#x201C;ivory tower&#x201D; approach to certain questions which are in dispute between the Government and the Opposition, I believe it is correct that discussion of certain international affairs should be quietly conducted. I am sure the Minister and I might perhaps prefer to use more subdued language than my colleague chose to use a few minutes ago; but this is a matter of how one is involved. I think it is perfectly fair for the Minister to say, where he holds responsibility for the conduct of diplomacy, where he is privy to a great deal of confidential information, that he himself must naturally guard his language very carefully and behave with the discretion which becomes a Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>So far as the Opposition is concerned, there are of course matters of public interest and matters of dispute. While we may agree to observe our due share of discretion in dealing with these matters, and while we do feel that there are certain matters which require some adherence to the ancient, time-honoured and well proven rules of diplomacy, we nevertheless, as an Opposition, feel that we are rendering a service to the State, to South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad, and, in fact, to the task which the hon. the Minister has to carry out abroad, by showing ourselves to be a lively, informed and critical Opposition.</p>

<p>It is because I believe in this and also because I believe these time-honoured rules of diplomacy should be observed that I also have my reservations&#x2014;I say so frankly&#x2014;about the manner in which the hon. the Prime Minister dealt with the Kaunda correspondence. I believe it is most important to the conduct of diplomacy that confidences should be preserved. I believe that one runs great risks and encounters dangers, and whatever the provocations might have been&#x2014;I believe they were great &#x2014;whatever the temptation might have been to cut Dr. Kaunda down to size, and I believe it was a great temptation, I think one must still think twice and three times before one departs from these basic and well tried rules, because most often in the history of diplomacy that has led to disaster.</p>

<p>We do not have all the information at our disposal. It may be that an objective can be achieved which cannot as yet be foreseen, but I would be surprised if, indeed, this attempt to discredit a man who, whatever his weaknesses and his faults, occupies a key position in Africa, can in the long run succeed as an act of diplomacy. I say he occupies a key position in Africa, because Zambia is a country which finds itself situated between that cluster of states in Southern Africa which, for various reasons, co-operate closely with South Africa, and various constellations of other states to the north of Zambia which take various other attitudes towards South Africa. Zambia does occupy a strategic position in the geographic sense, and Dr. Kaunda as its president, and as the president also of the Organization for African Unity, occupies a key position in another sense as well. Now, I am not at all convinced that what has happened, will in fact cut down Dr. Kaunda to size or that it will diminish his authority. It may well be, and one is relieved to find that certain statesmen in Africa&#x2014;I think particularly of President Houphouet-Boigny&#x2014;have not so far been deterred from seeking dialogue. I do not want to take this matter any further than that, except to express this reservation about the way in which it has been handled.</p>

<p>We favour dialogue and we wish to see it succeed. What then are the elements most necessary for its success? First of all, I want to say that a dialogue cannot succeed if it is the intention of each head of State to use his powers of persuasion to such an extent that he believes he can override the opinions and policies of the other. If each head of state who comes to South Africa came here convinced that he could persuade the South African Government to abandon its policies, to change them and to accept those policies which are pressed upon him, the dialogue can obviously not succeed. If on the other hand, we in South Africa were to engage people in dialogue but prove ourselves to <span class="col_6879-6880" refersTo="page_0573"/>be entirely intractable in a discussion of our problems, I also believe we will be unlikely to succeed. It will be like the old scientific conundrum of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.</p>

<p>I would say that we could find a great deal of other common ground. I have already referred to certain areas in which dialogue about our own policies was possible; areas that are sensitive but amenable to improvement. I want to come to another common interest, namely the defence of Africa against communism. This is obviously a matter of concern to many African states. I would say that that could form the basis of a good deal of close co-operation and of mutual interest. It is necessary, however, that when we deal with communism we should deal with the realities of communism and not with its myths. Communism is not a generic term to describe everything of which we take an unfavourable view in Africa. I do not accuse the hon. the Minister of taking this line, but one has heard it in this House and also elsewhere. I think it is a great mistake not to make distinctions between the various causes of danger and unrest and the various potentials for dissension in Africa; and to damn them all with the common generic name of communism.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">I. F. A. DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to suggest another matter which I hardly need to raise, because it is already very much in the mind of the Government, namely the question of technical aid. This I believe will be a great source of common interest and there is really no point in emphasizing that.</p>

<p>Another point I would like to mention is that of South-West Africa. The hon. the Minister has asked us not to go into the question which is under discussion and I do not propose to do so. I would merely like to make the point that South-West Africa is in fact an issue which will form a major problem to South Africa in its foreign relations for many years to come. I believe the real question as far as South-West Africa is concerned, in spite of what has been said and is said, is not a choice between South Africa and the United Nations. It will eventually be a question of a choice between South Africa, the <i>status quo</i>, and independence. Whether we take the United Nations into the picture or not, the real choice before the people of South-West Africa is whether they wish to continue under and with South Africa as at present, in an evolutionary form, or whether in fact it would best suit their purposes and the purposes of the rest of the world, and in fact bring peace to that area and peace in our international relations in respect of that area, if in fact the people were to feel that independence is the best solution. Before I sit down I want to make a suggestion as to what kind of independence it ought to be. I believe that in Southern Africa we have a great many problems to solve, problems of various kinds; and that it is possible within this area for the component parts, the territories of Southern Africa, to have constitutions and forms of government of various kinds. I believe nevertheless that it is possible for them to work together in ever increasing prosperity and amity in a form which may loosely be described as a common market, an economic community, in Southern Africa. I think we must all think very hard about such a solution to the problems of Southern Africa. It would be wrong to force people into one mould or to try to do so. It would be wrong to force our points of view and our policies on each other. Within such an area of common prosperity and economic union, I believe we would find that in our differences we would have very much more in common.</p>

<heading>RETIREMENT OF SECRETARY TOTHE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY</heading>

<p>Mr. Speaker read the following letter:</p>

<p>House of Assembly, Cape Town.</p>

<p>17th May, 1971.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Speaker,</p>

<p>I beg to inform you that I desire, during the forthcoming Parliamentary recess, to retire as Secretary to the House of Assembly, a post I have held for approximately 12 years.</p>

<p>I cannot lay down the reins of office without expressing my gratitude for the support and encouragement so generously given to me by yourself and by all the other Presiding Officers of this House.</p>

<p>To the members of all parties in the eleven Parliaments I have known, I extend my warmest thanks for the courtesies, kindnesses and consideration they have shown me.</p>

<p>I should also like to thank my colleagues, past and present, for their assistance, co-operation and loyalty at all times, and to say that it is my considered opinion that the House has a very conscientious and competent staff.</p>

<p>After 41 years it is only natural that I leave the service of Parliament with great regret. I am, however, proud of the fact that practically the whole of my working life has been spent in the service of the House of Assembly, whose procedure today is, in my view, as modern and as streamlined as that of any similar institution in any democratic country in the world.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be,</p>

<p>Sir,</p>

<p>Your obedient servant,</p>

<heading>PUBLIC SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, basically this clause provides for the secondment of persons in the employ of an authority of a non-White territory to the Public Service of the Republic and for the transfer of officials and employees from the Public Service of the Republic to the Public Service of a non-White authority as defined in clause 1 of this Bill.</p>

<p>The secondment of non-Whites from a non-White Territorial Authority to the Public Service of the Republic does not appear to be a necessary provision having regard to the Public Service Commission Act as it stands. One must bear in mind that the Bantu employed by a Territorial Authority, such as the Transkei, are South African citizens. In terms of section 11 of the Public Service Act a person may be appointed to the Public Service permanently on condition, <i>inter alia</i>, that he is a South African citizen. In other words, the law as it stands now, does not make it impossible for the Public Service of the Republic to employ a Bantu.</p>

<p>The second aspect of this clause is the transfer of a non-White officer or employee from the Public Service to the Public Service of a Territorial Authority. In this connection I wish to refer the hon. the Minister to section 13 of the Act which contains one of the cardinal protections of any person, White or non-White, who is employed in the Public Service of South Africa and under the control of the Public Service Commission. This section provides that whereas the commission has the power to transfer an official or employee from one branch of the Service to another, that can be done only with the full protection <span class="col_6883-6884" refersTo="page_0575"/>of his status, salary and his other conditions of employment. It is true that this clause makes no provision for a transfer, although it refers to it as such. In fact, it makes provision for a secondment. In other words, the Xhosa teacher being employed by the Department of Bantu Education and teaching in a school, say, at Langa, can by means of a book entry be transferred to the Public Service of the Transkei and taken back on secondment to the Public Service of the Republic. Secondment of a person employed in the Public Service means that that person is going to be subjected to the rules and regulations of another body, a body over which the Public Service Commission has no control. The question of secondment is dealt with in section 13 (6) of the principal Act. The cardinal point of that subsection is that secondment can only take place with the consent of the official concerned. I want to repeat that that is there because it is basic to the Public Service and to the stability of the Public Service of this country that employees in that Public Service shall be protected as to their rights, their promotion and their privileges except in cases of wrongdoing or inefficiency, when certain penal provisions can be applied. It is for that reason that I believe that this clause would open up possibilities for potential injustice to 42 per cent of the Public Service controlled by the Public Service Commission if this power be granted to transfer without the consent of the official or employee concerned. Whilst one accepts that a transfer can take place and that it is desirable, for the very reasons which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration and Education gave, to give opportunities for advancement, I submit that as this Bill does not protect the rights in regard to the salary grading and other rights of that person on transfer to the Territorial Authority, he should only be asked to take that transfer with his consent. For those reasons I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>While not agreeing with the arguments of the hon. member for Green Point in respect of several of the matters he raised on Friday and which he again raised today, I am quite prepared for other reasons to accept his amendment. I gave my reasons on Friday when this House was given the assurance, and I still have the assurance, that the Public Service Commission will, by virtue of its record and by virtue of its approach to these matters, give all the protection which is necessary to the people who are transferred to the Bantu Authorities. This has happened in the past. We have had no reason whatsoever to think that the Public Service Commission will bring about a situation which can be regarded as inhuman or unfair as far as the transfers are concerned, I want to reiterate that in view of the standing of this Commission, and its very responsible approach, we can accept, in terms of the Bill before the House, that this will in fact happen. But to ensure that the hon. member and other hon. members opposite will be satisfied, I am quite prepared to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member, in saying that, I want to repeat that I think much of what the hon. member has said and the case on which his approach was built in the Second Reading, was an unfair one. I think it was unfair because the transfer of Bantu to the various Bantu Authorities in the various areas will indeed be a rather slow process. It cannot happen overnight. It was only in 1963 that the Transkei found itself in the position where it was given virtual control of a large number of Bantu who worked as employees in the Transkei. And in view of what happened in the Transkei we have every reason to believe that the Bantu authorities can control the situation quite well. There is no reason to fear what the hon. member and the hon. member for Transkei seems to fear, when they said that we have no assurance that the same conditions would prevail in the Civil Service of those Bantu areas and under those authorities, as prevail in the White areas where it is controlled by the Public Service Commission. Sir, I do not want to reiterate all the other points, but I trust that the hon. member, since I have accepted his amendment, will in turn accept the assurance given by this side of the House that we shall see to it that this measure is administered in a fair way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister for accepting the amendment which I moved, but I want to clear up one or two matters which he raised. The first is that in moving this amendment there was no intention on our part of casting any reflection on the Public <span class="col_6885-6886" refersTo="page_0576"/>Service Commission and its just handling o&#x00A3; this situation. After all. Sir, this Government itself tied the hands of the Public Service Commission in the 1957 Act in so far as this question of consent is concerned. It was not suggested then that it was disrespectful to the Public Service Commission to insert that clause. This amendment does remove the element of compulsion which we found unacceptable. The other aspect which does arise, is this: I take it that we can accept that where a non-White official is transferred from our Public Service, with his consent, after having been trained in our Public Service, the purpose of that transfer will be to enable him to advance in the service of his own community in the territorial authority concerned. Similarly where a non-White official is seconded to our Public Service, he will be seconded here for the purpose of receiving his training, and that in due course he will be transferred back so that he can serve his own community in his own territorial authority area. My reason for raising this with the hon. the Minister is this: If these provisions are utilized in the restricted form that I have now suggested&#x2014;and I accept the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement that that is what is intended&#x2014;we will still have to make provision in our own Public Service for the employment of a vast number of non-Whites who will be required to serve the urban non-White population in the years ahead. As the hon. the Minister knows, 42 per cent of the employees controlled by the Public Service Commission at the present time are non-Whites. I thank the hon. the Minister for accepting that amendment. It does remove the main objection that we had to this particular clause.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>In the time at my disposal I should like to say a few words about the relationship between the Republic of South Africa and the emancipated Black states in Africa. Today the old saying that there is always something new out of Africa, is also applicable to the present circumstances. Today in Africa a pattern of inter-state relations between peoples is developing in front of our eyes, and the ultimate polarization of these relations will be of primary importance to the Republic of South Africa, Power politics, which was the means of colony building in the past, has once again made its appearance in Africa in an amended form and with a different object. The politically emancipated states in Africa which have come into existence during the past decade or more are in a melting-pot today. Gradually, according to the slow pattern on which foreign political and economic policy structures are shaped and developed, they will be led, by internal political and economic considerations, to determining their relations between peoples under the influence of the three major power structures which are developing in Africa.</p>

<p>The first power structure is Communism, which is openly offering its philosophy of life as an export article in Africa. Moreover, it is offering it on credit. Examples of this may be seen in Eastern Europe. The second power structure is certain Western powers which, with a variety of motives, are offering financial aid for development. Between 1967 and 1969 1 354 million American dollars were poured into Africa. The third power structure here in Africa is centralized with its nucleus in Southern Africa, where an economic, scientific and spiritual power structure is developing at present, which must eventually exercise far-reaching and determining influence on Black Africa&#x2019;s national relationships policy.</p>

<p>The Republic of South Africa, together with the neighbouring states, constitute this economic power structure. Behind this power structure a momentum is to be observed which is astonishing, measured by standards we may uncover in history, This unfolding of an economic, scientific and spiritual power structure in Southern Africa is creating a new evaluation of national freedom and national relations in Africa. Black Africa will not be able to escape from this radiation from the South.</p>

<p>The Republic of South Africa did not, after a long period of colonial domination and influencing, see and accept its freedom as an ultimate object. The policy of political <span class="col_6887-6888" refersTo="page_0577"/>emancipation in which the Republic of South Africa is engaged at present in respect of White-Bantu relations, is not a cul-de-sac either. The reality of freedom in which the Republic of South Africa finds itself, is supported by economic, scientific and spiritual productivity, achievements and preparedness. No gift of money has been made to the Republic. The Republic need not butter up the various power political empires. The Republic need not run with the hare and hunt with the hounds or indulge in double-talk or try to derive benefit from a cat and mouse political game. It is the economic and the spiritual strength of the Republic and its neighbouring states which makes of this freedom of the Republic of South Africa a non-aligned freedom.</p>

<p>Economic dependency or economic inability or labour unproductivity or scientific or technological stagnation, coupled with a rapid increase in the population, is historical and, according to all contemporary considerations, irreconcilable to real freedom. The economic, scientific and spiritual power structure which is developing here in South Africa is not of an imperialistic nature either. We cannot be that, because the Republic of South Africa is in Africa and we are of Africa. This constellation of states in Southern Africa does not lay down any ideologies for Africa. We offer no agitators or a propaganda machine which will follow in the wake of our offer of co-operation. We are not engaged in power politics backed by military power or threats. We are not offering smart, trained diplomats to Black Africa. We are offering assistance for the development of those supports which will let Africa enjoy the full meaning of political freedom. South Africa and its neighbouring states appreciate Africa&#x2019;s need for calm, productive labour and development of its vast physical and human resources.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that at some time or other Black Africa will have to choose amongst the power constellations which are developing here in Africa. The Southland&#x2019;s power structure has not and will not allow itself to be led to dominating others or to dictating. However, we shall not have others abdicate either. In future it will never be possible for Black Africa to fail to see the Southern Star. Let those who want to come to talk to us, do so. They are welcome.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here are quite a number of questions we should have liked to put to the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but unfortunately the time for this debate has almost expired. We shall perhaps seek an opportunity later in the Session to put these questions to him.</p>

<p>There are only two points which I should like to raise here briefly. The one is the question of South-West. On Friday the hon. the Minister raised the question of South-West pursuant to a speech I had made during the by-election in Windhoek East. There will be no time for me to repeat here the arguments which I put forward there. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that I do not know of any standpoint I adopted there which I have to correct. I just want to mention one point. What I found rather astonishing was that the hon. the Minister tried to get away from that. The Government made an offer to the court in The Hague that it was prepared to hold a plebiscite in the Territory in which the entire population of South-West could choose whether they wanted to be governed by the Republic or by the U.N. Surely it goes without saying that, if people are asked to choose between two parties, in this case between the Republic and the U.N., the two parties must then be afforded the opportunity of submitting their plans for the future of the Territory to those voters. Otherwise there cannot be any question of an impartial vote which anyone would accept as the considered decision of the inhabitants of the Territory.</p>

<p>I must say that I cannot for one moment think that the Government intended that only one side&#x2014;in this case it would be our side&#x2014;would have had the exclusive right to inform the inhabitants during such a plebiscite, I do not think the court in The Hague would have allowed this if it had accepted the Government&#x2019;s proposal of a plebiscite. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me in this regard.</p>

<p>Therefore I think, to mention only one example, that I was quite justified in mentioning jt as a fact in Windhoek, in reply to certain assertions in the election manifesto of the Government candidate, that the Government&#x2019;s plebiscite proposal would, if the court in The Hague had accepted it, have involved the U.N. directly in South-West. I want to recommend to the hon. the Minister that he and the Government should be frank with the people in South-West <span class="col_6889-6890" refersTo="page_0578"/>rather than to beat about the bush concerning the implications of any proposal put forward by them in respect of South-West. I know the people of South-West. They are sufficiently experienced to deal with problems.</p>

<p>While I am on the question of South-West, I should like to draw the attention of the Government to something else. The court in The Hague will, perhaps only in a few weeks time, but perhaps any day from now onwards, give us its decision on the South-West case which has just been before it. I do not want to start any speculation about what the possible result may be; it goes without saying that all of us here hope that the result will be favourable or, at least, not too unfavourable. However, we know that this decision, even if it is only an advisory opinion, may lead to our country being placed in a very serious position. Up to now the Government has dealt with the whole question of South-West Africa quite on its own and unilaterally and has completely excluded the Opposition, or rather, Parliament. The Government had the right to do this and I do not dispute that right at all, although we have always doubted whether it was wise of the Government to deal with such an important matter in that way. We believe the Government has allowed itself to be led far too much by local party-political considerations in dealing with the matter of South-West. In the process it has taken steps which have helped nothing to bring the South-West question nearer to a solution. I think that, for example, it was a great mistake to weaken the local government of South-West. Be that as it may, it is not something we can discuss in the few minutes that are left. We have always believed that the question of South-West is of such overriding importance to South Africa, that the matter affects us so very deeply, that the government of the day ought to seek parliamentary unanimity before taking any drastic steps in respect of the Territory. I am not going to suggest today that the Government should establish an advisory committee on South-West, a committee which would be representative of both sides in Parliament; the power resides in the Government and the choice will be its choice. It may act in that way if it wants to, or it may act unilaterally as it has done up to now. All I still want to tell the Government, through the hon. the Minister, is that we on this side of the House have always been prepared in the past and will again be prepared to consult about such an important matter as South-West. However, the choice must be the Government&#x2019;s. If it chooses not to do so, it is its right and then we are satisfied with that as well. In actual fact something like that only ties the hands of the Opposition. I want to tell the hon. the Minister frankly: We on this side of the House have our views as to what is in the best interests of South Africa. When the Government acts in a way which does not harm the interests of the country, we usually do not stand in its way. However, the Government must understand that we are not prepared, and now I am talking specifically about the possible decision there may be in respect of the South-West case, to be dragged along behind the Government in everything it chooses to do in respect of the affairs of South-West. If it takes steps which involve South Africa in serious difficulties, and does so without consulting this side of the House and Parliament as a whole, and we do not agree with these steps, we shall not hesitate to criticize the Government openly, crisis or no crisis. [Interjections,] I have already stated that the choice is up to the Government, but if it does not want to deal with this on a parliamentary basis, we shall be at liberty, completely at liberty, to make a political matter out of any steps taken by the Government, to criticize them, and if necessary to go to the people with it. [Interjections.] What are hon. members making a fuss about? I have been so kind as to give them the choice of consulting.</p>

We feel that, for our part, we want to bring this to the attention of the Government timeously.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the correction by the hon. the Minister, but we have gained the impression that we have already reached that stage with Lesotho. If we do get as far as that, it will be a very good step, but what worries me a little is our relations with Botswana. I cannot help remembering that shortly after Pres. Kaunda became the leader of Zambia&#x2014;I think it was roundabout 1964&#x2014;he offered to enter into diplomatic relations with South Africa. He couched the offer in rather strong language at the time, but his language was not stronger than the language now being used by the members of the dialogue group in respect of apartheid. The Government thought fit not to accept his offer at the time, and we all know what happened after that and how difficult it subsequently became to get Zambia within the Southern African circle again. Shortly after Pres. Khama became president, Botswana made a similar offer. Again nothing was forthcoming from our side. The impression one gains today, is that he is also gradually moving outside the Southern circle and seeking closer liaison with Zambia. I should like to point out that the matter of Botswana is of particular importance because of its border position. I want to conclude by just inquiring what the chances are that the Government will, in respect of Botswana, consider taking the same steps as in the case of Lesotho. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the plebiscite proposed to the World Court by the Government has already been discussed in this House by the hon. the Minister. Consequently I do not want to enlarge upon it, except to say that one would have thought the position would be clear by this time. The proposal was for a plebiscite to be held to ascertain the wishes of the people of South-West Africa in respect of the question whether they want to continue being led along the road to self-determination by the Republic of South Africa, or whether they want to be administered by the U.N. This question concerns a matter of principle. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is now arguing in exactly the same way as U Thant and his associates did. After all, one does not ask a question on a matter of principle and then anticipate procedures. When our opponents tried to play tricks of that nature we told them first to accept the proposal in principle before talking about procedures. The South African Government was at no stage opposed to any particular procedures, as long as it would be a system able to ascertain the wishes of the people objectively, fairly and efficiently. The U.N. had absolutely nothing to do with the implementation of the proposal. The U.N. is a party to the dispute, and how can it now be said that the U.N. should have had a say in the implementation of it? This proposal was made in the Court as a way in which proof could be furnished of the feelings of the people in South-West Africa. If one pages through the thousands of pages of U.N. records in which the policy of this Government is denounced as one of the most oppressive that has ever existed on earth and as one that forces people to revolt against it by means of terrorism, people who are only waiting for the moment of liberation, then surely it must be expected that they will eagerly seize upon such an opportunity of getting rid of this terrible Government merely by making a cross on a piece of paper. This is the first point.</p>

<p>The second point is the allegation made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout that the people of South-West Africa do not know where they stand. This is a new argument. On 26th September, 1969, the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs wrote a letter of 300 pages to U Thant, the longest love letter he has ever received. This letter sets out categorically and fully, page by page, this Government&#x2019;s policy, the progress made in South-West Africa in every sphere of life, and our legal standpoints in connection with South-West Africa. At the end of the letter the following is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Fundamentally, the question is: Whose interests are to be served? Our own aim is clear. For us the interests of the peoples of South-West Africa are paramount. Can all those who insist on ending our administration show achievements in their own countries comparable with the increasing benefits enjoyed by the peoples of South-West Africa?<br/>In the General Assembly in 1966 I emphasized, with reference to a statement of the South African Prime Minister, that the South African Government had no designs of aggrandizement or aggression against its neighbours or against any other state in the world. I must repeat: We neither present any threat to peace, <span class="col_6893-6894" refersTo="page_0580"/>nor are we a threat to any country. On no account will we abandon the peoples of South-West Africa, who for half a century have placed their trust in us to lead them on the path of progress, peace and stability.</block>

<p>That is the unequivocal answer of the South African Government. It has repeatedly been presented in the U.N., in committees of the U.N., in communications by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and in the World Court.</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell on this any further. In the short time at my disposal I just want to say something about Mr. Ramsay Clarke, the former Attorney-General of the United States of America, who was here recently. He expressed himself on various matters in this country and he tried to dictate all kinds of recipes to us which even in America have not yet finally succeeded. I felt that this might be a suitable occasion for replying to that. Although he is no longer here, his friends, Nusas, will probably forward the reply to him. What I want to say in this connection, is that I do not want to present the American scene here as something ugly, wrong or oppressive and in the spirit of &#x201C;you oppress, so we can oppress as well&#x201D;&#x2014;I do not want to do that at all. My point of departure is that the U.S.A. has totally different circumstances of life. They have a totally different set of facts. They have a small group of people of a different colour, the Negroes, who have been living with them for centuries, speak the same language and do not even know where their specific countries of origin in Africa are, because they were taken to America as slaves. One would have expected that it would have been possible for these people, who constitute only 10 per cent of the total American population, to have been readily integrated by America. It is in respect of them that that policy has not yet been implemented successfully. I am not saying that they are wrong in their policy. For them in their circumstances it may be the right policy. But I just want to read what was recently written by an authority on the situation. He is Dr. Richard Newman, a member of the academic staff of the Department of Human Relations of the University of Boston. That is the university in the East of the U.S.A., the so-called &#x201C;Eastern Seaboard&#x201D;, where people such as the Kennedys had strong support. With reference to the Black Power Movement, about which the member for Houghton frequently has much to say as well, he writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a serious attempt to create selfpride and group acceptance among Negroes whose identity has been destroyed by slavery, subjection, racism and poverty.</block>

<p>It is the country of Mr. Ramsay Clarke which is referred to here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a serious attempt to create political strength among previously disenfranchized Southern Negroes as well as enfranchized Northern Negroes whose political choices are usually limited to White or Coloured servants of the White power structure. It is a serious attempt to create economic security for the thousands of Negro families whose standard of living falls below anyone&#x2019;s conception of subsistence.</block>

<p>In the light of this I should like to tell Mr. Ramsay Clarke that a little more humility, a little more insight into the problems of other countries would do him absolutely no harm, particularly not when he comes to this country. This gimmick of American politicians to think that they must go to Africa, Israel, Italy and heaven knows what other countries for election considerations in the U.S.A. does not impress us at all&#x2014; it does not impress us, nor does it impress the African leaders, who are slowly getting to know us better and getting to understand our true motives better.</p>

<p>I may also remind Mr. Ramsay Clarke of something else. We administer South-West Africa in such a way as to promote the welfare of its inhabitants. The U.S.A. also has a trusteeship area, by the name of Micronesia, which they also had to administer so as to promote the welfare of the inhabitants. Does he know what was said about the administration by the U.S.A. by the very U.N. committee that took the lead in the so-called termination of our administration of South-West, a step that was eagerly supported by people like Mr. Ramsay Clarke? A petitioner who appeared before the Trusteeship Council of the U.N. said the following about Micronesia, which has only 80 000 people, a mere handful, to be administered&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So, since that day of 2nd April. 1947, when the U.N. approved the strategic clause of the Trusteeship Agreement for <span class="col_6895-6896" refersTo="page_0581"/>the former Japanese Mandated Islands, we Micronesians have been a people without a country, without land. Since then Micronesia has been a captive of the world&#x2019;s most democratic nation &#x2026; My people has been robbed of its land; it has been &#x201C;accidentally&#x201D; subjected to nuclear fall-out; it has been left to starve on small, remote islands.</block>

<p>This is what is alleged. What were the conclusions of U.N. committees? It is explicitly stated in the records that the U.S.A. had not even fulfilled its trusteeship duties in the economic sphere. By way of explanation the ambassador of the U.S.A. made, <i>inter alia</i>, the following submission in regard to disparities in the wage structure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The disparities arose because the wage levels of the United States administrators and technicians who were working there were established in the U.S. The U.N. should not take the responsibility of recommending a wage level which the future self-governing economy would not be able to support.</block>

<p>But when we try to do the same in this country it is regarded as abhorrent. Then action has to be taken against us. I should like to tell Nusas and Mr. Ramsay Clarke that we are diligently and sincerely trying to find a solution to our problems in the light and on the basis of facts that exist here. We believe that they are trying to do the same in the U.S.A. We should like to see them find a solution to their problem on the basis of their methods and their circumstances, All we ask of them is this: Allow us to find our solution on the basis of our methods and our facts and our circumstances here,</p>

<p>I want to start with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, although I do not want to speak about the plebiscite again, especially since the findings of the court in this connection have been made known. The hon. member said we were inclined to beat about the bush concerning the implications of our actions in connection with South-West Africa and that he knew the people of South-West Africa. Well, we also know those people and up to now we have always received nothing but appreciation from them. Of course, we also realize the importance of the opinion of the court, which is expected shortly. We realize its implications. I have taken cognizance of what the hon. member said on behalf of his party about the offer of consultation. This is a matter for the Prime Minister and for the Government, of course, but I must also tell him that we have taken cognizance of what, he will admit, amounts to a veiled threat, namely the promise to criticize us if they do not agree with us.</p>

<p>It is his democratic right, of course, which they have exercised in the past in other spheres as well. We take cognisance of it.</p>

<p>As regards the relations with Botswana, I think the hon. member may safely leave these matters in the hands of the Government. I shall certainly not discuss this matter now, because it is one which also involves another sovereign state and it would be wrong of me to express myself on it unilaterally here. The matter is in the hands of the Government and you may safely leave it there.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to a report which appeared in Saturday&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i> under the headline: &#x201C;Criticism! Human failure blamed.&#x201D; I made the statement last week that our policy of separate development was sometimes blamed as a result of the way in which it was applied by individuals. In this connection I spoke of errors of judgment, discretion that is exercized wrongly and discourtesy on the part of South Africans. I thought I had expressed myself very clearly in this connection, but now I read the following in Saturday&#x2019;s <i>Argus</i>, and I should like to rectify it:</p>

<block name="quote">Failures of judgment, discourtesy and plain bad manners by Government officials were blamed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday for evoking world criticism of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is not what I said or meant, of course. We all know that our officials are conscientious and I am thinking in the first place of the officials in the homelands who have to implement our policy of separate development there. These people are known for that, and almost invariably they impress foreign visitors who meet them with their devotion, their diligence and their competence. Consequently I certainly did not have those or other officials in mind. <span class="col_6897-6898" refersTo="page_0582"/>I can mention examples of excellent conduct on the part of officials charged with the implementation of our policy. I am thinking, for instance, of the very tactful conduct of officials at our airports and at our customs posts. I am thinking of the tact and the patience displayed by our police, often under difficult circumstances and great provocation. Hon. members will agree with me that it was not our officials whom I had in mind, but I was thinking of the conduct of all South Africans, including myself, irrespective of the political party to which such a South African belongs, I was even thinking of Progressives. I was even thinking of the wife of the liberal in Johannesburg who had an interview with Allen Drury, the author of &#x201C;A Very Strange Society&#x201D;. I want to read to you, Sir, what he said in this connection on page 426 of this book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From time to time the Bantu houseboy would come in to help with the serving, and never in any home, Afrikaans- or English-speaking in all South Africa, did I hear such tones of boredom, sharpness, contempt and arrogant impatience with the servant as I heard in the liberal editor&#x2019;s home from the liberal editor&#x2019;s wife.</block>

<p>This is the kind of conduct in regard to our non-Whites that I had in mind when I spoke here as a South African and in the interests of South Africa. That the appeal I made was not universally misinterpreted appears from an excellent editorial which appeared in <i>Die Burger</i> this morning and which I hope all hon. members and other South Africans will read. It is not written in a party-political vein; it is written in the interests of South Africa and in the spirit in which I spoke Last Friday, as appears from the following sentence that I want to quote from it (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Enough stories are fabricated by our enemies. Let us not facilitate their task and complicate that of the people who have to defend our cause here and abroad.</block>

<p>I leave it at that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietersburg pleaded, <i>inter alia</i>, that we should emphasize points of agreement, common aspirations, common interests, in the case of the United States of America. Both the Government and I fully endorse that attitude which he pleaded for, and I have said before in this House that this is also my endeavour as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The so-called controversial aspects of our relations with the U S A. in most cases do not concern really important matters. In practice these aspects concern, for example, visas and residence permits, and I have already mentioned in this House that I discussed them frankly with the American Ambassador quite recently, and I hope and trust that he now has a better understanding of our position and our motivation. There are, of course, matters of principle on which we differ very strongly with the United States of America, but that need not cloud our relations, for there are many important matters, many important objectives, which we share with that important country. There is therefore no reason why there cannot be a fruitful exchange of view&#x2019;s between South Africa and the United States; there is no reason why there cannot be fruitful co-operation in matters of common interest. This is the way that we in the Government see our relations with America, and this is what is already being aimed at and done in practice.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis had reservations about the disclosures concerning President Kaunda of Zambia. I want to say that when decisions are taken about the course of action to be followed in connection with such a delicate matter as this, such a finely balanced matter, it would be very unwise to discuss in public the considerations of the Government and of the Prime Minister in this connection. I also want to emphasize, as the hon. the Prime Minister has already done, that he left the door wide open for further contact with Zambia. Hon. members who are not so clear on that any more will do well to read up Hansard in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Von Brandis also referred to what happened in the time of Dr. Verwoerd in the case of the former Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar <span class="col_6899-6900" refersTo="page_0583"/>Balewa. However, he did not quite present the matters in its full context. For instance, he made no mention of what had occurred between Dr. Verwoerd and Sir Abubakar Balewa, the dialogue that took place between them. Neither did he give the full motivation of Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s refusal to allow him to come here. Hon. members might still remember that matters were not conducted through diplomatic channels at the time, but that a public announcement was made.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vasco referred to the establishment of a development hank for Central and Southern Africa, in which my good friend, Dr. Anton Rupert, was also concerned. I must say that I am not yet fully informed concerning the organization that is envisaged here. In general, however, I may say that we welcome interest in our relations with African countries. We welcome attempts to establish closer relations with them and to co-operate with them. However, I am unable as yet to express myself fully on this particular step.</p>

<p>+ As far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned, I do not think she expects me to react to her speech. All I have to say to her is that I do not share her pessimistic views of a dialogue between South Africa and African leaders. Her pessimism may be the result of her experience during her visit to Zambia. I do not know. My own experience, however, based on discussions I have already had with several African leaders, makes me feel justified to be more optimistic than that hon. member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs has apologized for not being able to be here today. He pleaded that we should consider making use of the surplus labour in Mauritius, especially in view of the shortage of labour in our own country. Mauritius is just a small country, of course, about 25 miles by 30 miles in extent, with approximately 800 000 inhabitants. The hon. member's idea is that raw materials from the Republic should be used for industries in Mauritius. This is actually a matter for the private sector, but the Government is also paying attention to it. In fact, it is something that is welcomed by Mauritius, as the Mauritian Minister of Foreign Affairs explained to me only last week.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to respond to the speeches of all the members who took part in this debate. On this occasion I missed the contribution usually made here by the hon. member for Brentwood. But we are thinking of him and his wife in hospital and we wish them a speedy and complete recovery, furthermore, I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for the constructive contributions made by them, contributions that testify to study and serious reflection on our foreign relations. It will be worth while following up many of the things that have been said here.</p>

<p>There was only one discordant note in this debate, something which left a bad taste in the mouth. The hon. member who was responsible for it has apologized for not being able to be here this afternoon. I am referring to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central. He expressed himself vehemently on the action taken by the Prime Minister in respect of President Kaunda. I had gained the impression, although I might have been wrong, that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition by implication endorsed the action taken by the Prime Minister. In any case, he did not condemn it. I may say that many others in the world, including Africa, did not condemn it either. Whether or not the hon. member agrees with the action taken by the Prime Minister, I do not want to Quarrel with him about it. He is a young member and therefore I do not want to pursue the matter any further either. I wish to try giving him some advice rather than condemn him. I think it will take him many years in this House to remove the bad taste which he left through this ill-considered action on his part. The hon. member must realize that unless a member, no matter on which side of the House he is, can command and enjoy the esteem and the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the Home, he may as well pack his bags and go home. That is all I have to say for the moment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I claim the privilege of the half-hour? The discussion we are about to have on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Labour <span class="col_6901-6902" refersTo="page_0584"/>is now becoming more important than ever, because the problems affecting South Africa in the field of labour are becoming severe, and are having repercussions in every sphere of our life in this country. The hon. the Minister competently controls one of the four factors of production in South Africa. It is, however, not only his economic responsibility that one has to consider. We also have to consider the fact that, as Minister of Labour, he is responsible for the welfare and the happiness of the majority of the people of South Africa. It is with that in mind that I want to ask the Minister to consider with us some of the problems he has to face and to take the country into his confidence regarding his plans and hopes to cope with these problems.</p>

<p>We face a strange problem in South Africa. We have a growing and acute shortage of skilled and semi-skilled workers. We have also a comparatively new phenomenon, and that is that we are experiencing a shortage of unskilled workers, mainly non-Whites. While we are experiencing these shortages, we have the very strange phenomenon of growing unemployment among the Black people of South Africa. The Minister of Planning recently spoke at the Beattie Hall at the University of Cape Town during a symposium on labour, and mentioned that there were something like 97 000 unemployed people in the homelands or the reserves. Dr. Hupkes, the general manager of Federale Beleggings, has indicated that he believes, according to calculations that have been made, that there are something like 150 000 Black people unemployed in South Africa, Prof. Sadie of Stellenbosch, speaking at the same symposium as the Minister of Planning, indicated that there were about 1&#x00BD; million Black people in this country who were either unemployed or else employed below their capacity and not earning enough to maintain themselves or their families at a decent standard of living. This is the strange distortion in the South African labour situation with which we have to deal. I have much to say in this regard but, knowing full well that there may be a tendency amongst hon. members on the other side to think that the approach of this side of the House is clouded and influenced by out political differences with the hon. the Minister, I should like at the outset to quote an authority whose impartiality and whose academic approach to this problem cannot be faulted. He is the head of the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch whose findings and comments we all regard as authoritative. I refer to Mr. A, J. M. de Vries. Addressing the South African Institute of Management towards the end of March, 1971, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since 1964 complaints of insufficient labour had been increasingly heard. At first they concerned skilled labour only, but now there was also a shortage of unskilled men. This, however, was not country wide. It existed mainly in a few centres, largely because of Government controls.</block>

<p>It is not a natural shortage; it is not a truly economic shortage, but a shortage induced by the actions, the proclamations, the laws and the administration of this Government. Mr. De Vries went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Surveys indicated that in the second half of last year 35 000 jobs were vacant in commerce and 63 000 in industry. Another indication of the great pressure on labour was that last September only 7 900 Whites, Coloureds and Asians were unemployed.</block>

<p>Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The labour shortage and the consequent pressure on wages and salaries was a major reason for inflation.</block>

<p>The article further reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. De Vries said it would thus appear that adjustments in the present labour policy were essential. At the moment there were not enough Whites available to do all the work. It was essential for this work to be done.</block>

<p>That is the gist of the problem which I should like to discuss with the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister owes it to the country to show that he has a solution to this problem. We can look upon the labour situation in this country as we like. We can talk of separate development. We can believe sincerely, as many hon. members opposite do, in the policy of separate development. But the one cardinal fact that we cannot deny or escape is the fact that the races in South Africa are inter-dependent upon each other. We cannot escape the fact that if we want to apply any policy <span class="col_6903-6904" refersTo="page_0585"/>towards the solution of our race problems in South Africa, including the policy of separate development, we need the money to carry such a policy out. For a long long time, no matter how the policy of separate development may progress&#x2014;and I doubt whether it will ever progress sufficiently&#x2014;we will need the money that comes from the existing industrial areas of South Africa to do what is right and necessary in seeking a solution for our race problems.</p>

<p>Under this Government, in spite of separate development, the inter-dependence is growing. Figures that were recently published in, I think, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, gained from official sources, showed that in I960, in all sectors of our economy, excluding agriculture, we had 987 000 White workers and 2 561 000 non-White workers. One can exclude agriculture because if agriculture were included, the picture would have been more startling then ever. However, by 1970, in one decade, the number of White workers had increased to 1 283 000 whereas the number of non-White workers had increased to 3 733 000 workers. The White workers had in ten years increased by 296 000 workers, but the non-White workers, during the same period, had increased by 1 172 000 workers. The non-White workers were increasing four times as fast as the White workers in spite of the policy of separate development. Note that these figures exclude, apart from agriculture, the Post Office, the Police, the Civil Service and the South African Railways. My hon. friend, the Minister of Transport, will confirm that there is an inter-dependence between White and non-White workers to make our great public transport organization continue to do its work and to flourish.</p>

<p>According to the experts the shortage of White labour in South Africa will increase even if we maintain immigration at the rate of 30 000 per year. We find that because there are not enough White workers in South Africa, the labour position is becoming warped. It is becoming warped, because unless there is an increasing number of White workers under the present laws doing the administrative, executive, skilled and the more highly semi-skilled jobs, we cannot continue to create the number of jobs necessary in South Africa to employ all the people of South Africa, including the non-Whites.</p>

<p>The extent of the shortage of labour is quite startling. We find that industry and commerce have between them a shortage of 100 000 workers. What do we find in the motor maintenance industry? South Africa has 2&#x00BD; million vehicles, but only 30 000 journeymen to keep those vehicles on the road. In a highly developed country, which has the largest motoring population in the world, the United States of America, there is one journeyman, one trained mechanic, for every 50 cars on the road. In South Africa we have one mechanic for more than every 80 cars on the road. Every one of us in this House can testify to the fact that it is becoming more difficult, more uncertain and more risky to maintain a car in proper order. We are told that some motor dealers&#x2014;not many of them&#x2014;are charging the public rates based upon the wages paid to qualified journeymen, when in fact many of these jobs have to be done by people who are not paid as qualified workmen, although they do the work of Qualified workers. One of the tragedies of South African life today is that in the labour field the laws of South Africa are being openly flouted and the Government is powerless to enforce them.</p>

<p>Who are the people who suffer? It is the public; they have to be satisfied with this type of practice. We know that they need 4 000 apprentices in the motoring industry and we know that only about 1 500 are available. In December, 1970, SEIFSA made a survey of its own requirements, namely the requirements of the steel industry. They found last year that they were 27 000 workers short out of a work force of 350 000. They calculated that the shortage would be 52 400 by next year. I have already mentioned that industry and commerce are running short of 100000 workers. This situation, a shortage of labour which is certainly artificial in the case of the unskilled worker because it is a legislative shortage, a Government-caused shortage, is leading to grave distortions in South Africa's life.</p>

<p>It is the major cause of inflation. We have heard from some of the Ministers&#x2014; this includes the Minister of Finance&#x2014;that it is exaggerated to say that the major cause for our inflation in South Africa is the shortage of labour. There we simply have to agree to differ. Every economic authority, every leader of business, and every economist in South Africa is on the side of the Opposition when we warn the Government that the major cause of inflation in South Africa is the labour shortage. <span class="col_6905-6906" refersTo="page_0586"/>Not only does the shortage of labour mean that prices are rising, but also that the various laws of South Africa which are made to restrict the use of the labour available in South Africa are causing uncertainty amongst the entrepreneurs of South Africa. It is already leading to a decrease in capital investment in secondary industry. Because this situation causes inflation, the Government believes it has to do something to combat inflation. It tries to combat inflation by limiting consumption rather than by trying to increase production. We find that the measures taken by the Government are to a large extent calculated to cause a further spate of inflation in South Africa. Over the last year or so, with the various budgetary measures of the Minister of Finance and his colleagues, we have had tremendous additions to the cost of production in South Africa. For example, I find that the Railways have added another R58 million to the cost of transport, which enters into the cost of production. Communication is an important factor which one has to take in mind when one calculates one's cost of production and the Post Office has added another R50 million to the bill. Through sales tax the Minister of Finance himself has added another R47 million to the cost of things which the people use. With the tax on petrol another R13 million has been added to the cost of private and other forms of public transport. These imports which affect the cost of living in South Africa and which cause inflation directly will amount, apart from other taxes, to RI68 million a year. As a result we are already hearing from leaders in the trade union movement that the value of the wages and salaries is being eroded. They have warned the Government that another series of wage demands is becoming inevitable. As wages go up the value of the rand depreciates further and much of the increase the people receive proves to be illusory and is dissipated.</p>

<p>The other distortion caused by the shortage of labour is that, as a result of it, the Government is taking extraordinary steps to stop private entrepreneurs and public employers from taking into their service the labour that is available. South Africa differs from other countries which have labour shortages in that in those countries the labour shortage is real, but it is artificial in South Africa. Labour is available, but the Government refuses to allow South Africa to employ the labour that is available. As a result we are holding back our White workers; if we stop a non-White worker from doing a job which is at present being done by a White worker at a lower level, that White worker will have to stay at that low level. He cannot rise because then there will be nobody to do the job. This is what I call a waste. But even worse, by holding back people like this, we are holding back our non-White workers, especially our Black workers, from making the progress to which they are entitled. They are being held back from making the contribution to the progress and welfare of South Africa that they can make; they are being denied the rewards for that contribution to which they are entitled. This is dangerous. There is one thing on which all of us in this House agree and that is that if we want to maintain order and peace in South Africa we need continued progress for all the peoples of South Africa. A rising standard of living for all in South Africa is the finest and the nearest to a certain guarantee we can get for peaceful progress in South Africa.</p>

<p>But the Government, through its policies, is deliberately adopting a negative attitude and is preventing this from happening. It is against this background that I read with great interest about interviews given during the last week by two key members of our Cabinet in this regard. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs spoke at the graduation ceremony of the College for Higher Technical Education on the Witwatersrand and said some quite remarkable things. He said that we needed an urgent and bold policy to train our labour resources in South Africa. He did not use the words &#x201C;a crash programme&#x201D;, but he obviously meant that. I can still remember the bitter sarcasm with which the hon. the Minister greeted a suggestion which came from our Leader last year that we should have a crash programme to train the labour of South Africa. He stood up and sneered for half an hour. He spoke Afrikaans and would not even translate the term &#x201C;crash programme&#x201D;, because it is more sneering in his opinion to use an English term than an Afrikaans one. I can remember that so well. According to the Argus the Minister of Economic Affairs &#x201C;warned today that a superhuman effort would have to be made to train South Africa&#x2019;s available labour to prevent the present acute shortage of trained labour from becoming worse&#x201D;. What labour? The Minister of Economic Affairs did not indicate <span class="col_6907-6908" refersTo="page_0587"/>what labour. Is it only to be White labour, or Coloured labour and Indian labour, because they are included in the definition of &#x201C;employees" under the Industrial Conciliation Act, or does it include Black labour. I think the hon. the Minister owes us some explanation on that.</p>

<p>Then we had the delightful statement by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I can only call it delightful because I do have a sense of humour. He told us that the Government had a flexible labour policy. They can meet any situation. What does he mean by a flexible labour policy?</p>

<p>Is it a policy which will allow the statutory colour bar to be relaxed? Does it affect clause 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act? Does it mean that some relief will be granted to the industries of South Africa? Does it mean that the Physical Planning and Utilization of Resources Act will not be applied as it is today in order to stifle industrial development in our existing urban areas? What does it mean? The hon. the Minister of Labour is responsible for the administration of this flexible labour policy. Perhaps he will take us into his confidence. Perhaps he will whisper to us across the floor of the House what this strange and startling statement means, because we have to remember that it is not only White labour that is scarce. As the Minister knows himself, he tried to relieve the situation of the building workers in the Transvaal by saying that they coud employ Coloured labour, but the Coloured labour was not there. We know that the authorities tell us that there is a fast developing shortage of Coloured and Indian labour. The only available labour is Black labour, Sir. Does a flexible labour policy take into account that while we have shortages of labour we have artificial bars and restraints against the use of Black labour? Does the flexibility include the use of Black people?</p>

<p>I want to say that we should face this problem honestly and courageously. The Government may face it honestly, but not very courageously, and the Government is certainly bluffing nobody by indulging in subterfuges to get around this problem. The Government is trying to make use of non-White labour, especially Black labour, even in skilled occupations, by a subterfuge, by bluffing the people; and that subterfuge and that bluff is the development of industries on the so-called borders of the African homelands. They tell us that if industrialists will go there they will not suffer the restrictions that the employers of non-White labour in the so-called White areas of South Africa suffer. The sky is the limit. A man can reach any qualification irrespective of colour, and he can do any work irrespective of colour.</p>

<p>But before I criticize that a hit, I want to bring in another authority to see whether the development of industry on the borders of the homelands, no matter how fast the Government does it, can under the policies of this Government, and with the achievements of this Government, meet and solve the labour problems of South Africa. Here I have a very interesting article in the November issue of <i>baNtu</i> by Prof. H J. J. Reynders of the University of Pretoria, who did a lot of excellent research for all of us in this article. He points out that if one wants, during the next 10 years, to absorb only the labour that comes on to the labour market from the homelands themselves, one would have to employ from 1970 to 1980 40 700 Black people per year, and from 1980 to 1990 53 000 Black people per year. But, if you want to absorb also the new labour coming on to the market in the White industrial areas, you will have to find jobs, from 1970 to 1980, for 88 000 Black people in the border industries and from 1980 to 1990 you will have to find jobs for 114 000 people in the border industries.</p>

<p>Sir, that is the need of South Africa; that is the problem that has to be solved. But what is the achievement of the Government? Prof. Reynders shows us and he goes back ten years; now you will see, Sir, how dose we are getting to giving employment to 400 000 and 800 000 people, as is necessary. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tussen 1960 en 1964 is aansoeke ten opsigte van 33 000 Bantoewerkers, dit is 6 600 per jaar, toegestaan. In die drie jaar daarna het die tempo na 5 300 per jaar afgeneem ondanks addisionele toegewings. In 1968 het dit verder na 5 000 gedaal en toe is nog meer toegewings gemaak en is ook die omstrede artikel 3 van die Wet op Fisiese Beplanning ingestel.</block>

<p><span class="col_6909-6910" refersTo="page_0588"/>The result of all that was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1969 is aansoeke ten opsigte van 27 000 Bantoewerkers deur die Permanente Komitee toegestaan, sodat die totaal van aansoeke goedgckeur in die dekade sestig, werkverskafling aan 81 000 addisionele Bantoes in die grensgebiede in die vooruitsig gestel het.</block>

<p>The employment of 81 000 Black people was held out as a prospect but the need. Sir, is about that number a year. How can we hope to solve our labour problem and to supply the labour needs of our burgeoning economy by relying upon the subterfuge of establishing border industries in the White areas of South Africa, using Black labour from the Black areas of South Africa without restrictions? That is the first question that the hon. the Minister should answer.</p>

<p>The second one that he should answer is this; What is he going to do about the danger signs that indicate that even this plan will not work? Already we have great distress amongst the garment workers of South Africa because of the preposterously low wages being paid in the textile industry on the borders of the reserves. There is great distress. Sir, because in Umtata there is a homeland industry&#x2014;or is it a border industry? Umtata is a White area so it must be a border industry. Although it is inside the Transkei, it is still a border industry! In Umtata there is a textile industry with none of the laws governing labour relations and wage de terminations applicable to it, and the result is that they are producing high-class clothing bought by some of the large departmental stores of South Africa for sale in our cities, being made by workers and labourers subject to no wage regulations whatsoever, no industrial agreements, no Wage Board determinations. Sir, here I have some interesting figures. In July of this year a new industrial agreement for the Transvaal garment workers will come into force, and the effect of that will be that garment workers in the Transvaal will have to compete with garment workers in the Rustenburg Beleggingskorporasie at Rustenburg&#x2014;and I mention the names so that the Minister will know that I am being specific&#x2014;at wages so ridiculously at variance that every textile industry in the White area of the Transvaal is being threatened by unfair competition. Sir, listen to the differences between the wages being paid in the White areas of the Transvaal and the wages being paid by Rustenburg Beleggingskorporasie: A beginner male marker, gets 58 per cent less; a qualified employee 47 per cent less; a female marker (beginner) 58,82 per cent less&#x2014;next door to Johannesburg, in Rustenburg&#x2014;a qualified employee 40,47 per cent less; a male machinist 61,28 per cent less as a beginner; a qualified machinist 45 per cent less; a labourer under the age of 18 years 54,55 per cent less; over the age of 18 years 64 per cent less.</p>

<p>But this is not because it is remote. It is not to compensate them because they have great transport costs. It is 40, 50 miles from Johannesburg. These people who are being employed at wages reasonably fixed under the enlightened industrial laws of South Africa have to compete next door against workers who are paid these ridiculously low wages. Can the Minister not see the possible conflict, the strains, the dispute which can develop there? What is he going to do about it? This is just for the sake of a subterfuge which will neither advance the policy of separate development, because it means economic integration at Rustenburg instead of Johannesburg. It certainly will not supply the labour needs of the whole economy of South Africa. Where are we going with this policy of the Minister? What will South Africa look like under this policy?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Yeoville carried on here in dramatic fashion today, as we have grown accustomed to from him. But now I must say that he said absolutely nothing new in his speech today, and made precisely the same speech he made last year. [Interjections.] hon. members can go and read it in column 3283. I took the trouble to read it. I say he repeated it. He put a <span class="col_6911-6912" refersTo="page_0589"/>lot of questions to the Minister, which were also put in a half-hour speech last year and replied to very thoroughly by the hon. the Minister. He said nothing new.</p>

<p>He came to light with the accusation that there was a terrible labour shortage at present, in regard to which we agree to a certain extent, hut we think it has been exaggerated. He referred to the building industry. He quoted people like Hupkes and De Vries here today, although it was Mr. Marais of the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and Mr. Van Wyk of Sanlam last year. We know those old stories by now. But what does the <i>Sunday Times</i> say? They referred specifically to the building industry and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Labour shortage is easing, says property developer.</block>

<p>This was yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i>, and this is what one of those gentlemen said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Suddenly there seems to have been a slight change in the labour situation, Mr. Friedman said. Brickies, plasterers and tilers are beginning to appear, and the cost of labour is dropping.</block>

<p>There you have it, Sir.</p>

<p>But during the Budget debate the hon. member for Yeoville also attacked us in this House on our labour policy. He then went further and accused this side of the House of having misled the voters of South Africa by having held the election last year instead of this year. We are now giving them a chance to prove this, let them go and test the misled voters at Waterberg on 23rd June. They can go and state their labour policy there. Then we can see whether the voters, the workers of South Africa, have been misled. But that they are not going to do; they are going to hide behind Mr. Jaap Marais, their ally.</p>

<p>However, I want to come to another matter. Time is short. I shall, as I have said, return to the hon. member, because they got hurt.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>That does not matter. Our candidate is there, and what is more, he will win. The hon. member knows as well as I do who it is. The Opposition tries to lay all the blame for the shortage of manpower on this Government, saying that it is a result of the policy of separate development and work reservation. Everything that happens they are trying to place squarely on the shoulders of this Government, and blame the Government for it. The hon. the Minister and we on this side of the House have repeatedly admitted that there is a manpower shortage, particularly in the engineering and manufacturing industries, but it is not so excessive as it is being made out to be.</p>

<p>As a result of the shortage in the above-mentioned industries a disturbing phenomenon is rearing its head in the private sector. I should like to bring it to the attention of the hon. the Minister. This phenomenon is occurring particularly in the Vaal Triangle, and also on the Witwatersrand. I want to refer more specifically to the area of the Vaal Triangle, because I am concerned with it and acquainted with it. This matter to which I am referring relates to enterprises which employ skilled labour in particular, such as electricians and other artisans, and then hires them out to industries, in other words, enterprises which are acting as labour brokers. Owing to the shortage of skilled labour, certain enterprises see their way clear to employing artisans and then hiring them out at a higher rate, for more than they pay those people themselves. Obviously they are making a tremendous profit from this.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there are no fewer than nine such enterprises in the Vaal Triangle, as well as several on the Witwatersrand. Let me explain what happens there. The average wage per hour for an artisan is plus-minus R1-35. To obtain artisans, it is obvious that the labour broker will have to pay a higher wage. Only in that way are they able to entice artisans away from industries. That is why they pay them up to R1-80 per hour and hire them out again at a rate which varies from R2-35 per hour to R3-50 per hour. That means that such a broker makes between 55 cents and R1-70 per hour profit on such a hired-out artisan. Because of the activities of these brokers the existing industrialists are unable to keep their people in their service. They are being enticed away by these brokers. This parasitic existence cannot be tolerated.</p>

<p>Another danger implicit in this system is that such an organization cannot offer <span class="col_6913-6914" refersTo="page_0590"/>its workers fringe benefits and there are actually many disadvantages for them in this system. Unfortunately, however, there are artisans who are interested only in the weekly wage they receive and not the fringe benefits they are losing. These brokers are not members of any agreement, and make a living solely out of their black market activities. In addition they are apparently not members of the employers&#x2019; organizations such as Seifsa, otherwise action would already have been taken against them. Their activities are of course a circumvention of the Industrial Conciliation Act because they are doing nothing to train manpower. They employ only artisans, but no apprentices. All they are doing is to prey on others and they are putting nothing back into the labour market.</p>

<p>What this phenomenon amounts to is an exploitation of the existing labour shortage and leads to an unnecessary increase in labour costs as well as consumer costs, and where can we find a greater stimulus to inflation than this? This causes problems in industry because the one artisan receives only R1-35 per hour while the next may earn up to R1-80. We can understand what problems this could bring in its wake. Moreover, the industry cannot under these circumstances maintain discipline. By way of summary I want to say that these labour brokers are contributing nothing useful to our industrial development, but are only out to make exorbitant profits, profits which industry and the consumer have to pay in the end. In addition to that, they are stimulating inflation and creating an unsound labour structure. That is why I am pleading with the hon. the Minister to go into this entire matter very thoroughly and to curb this phenomenon; it is very unsound for the development of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another minor matter I want to refer to. Last year I made a very serious plea here to the effect that we should proclaim our Republic Day to be a statutory paid day for all workers. We know that every nation has a national day. The national day of the people of South Africa is Republic Day. However, there is a group of workers who are not enjoying the benefits of that national day. Thanks to the National Party they now have that day as a holiday every fifth year, but I want to make a serious plea in this connection, in view of the fact that we are celebrating the 10th anniversary of this Republic of ours this year. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to whether we could not in future enjoy a Republic Day every year as a specified statutory holiday in terms of the Factories Act. I do not think there should be any discrimination among the workers of South Africa. Whether a man is a factory worker, a mineworker or a shop clerk, should make no difference. I want to make a serious request to the Minister to comply with this plea of mine for the worker of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, had time allowed, I should very much have liked to have come back to the hon. member for Yeoville, but I am afraid that there is simply no time. I would have liked to have furnished him with a very thorough reply in order to explain to him what the difference is between the policy of the National Party and the policy of the United Party. However, as I have said, the opportunity is there to put this question to the test. Let us put this matter to the test in Waterberg on 23rd June. Those hon. members must not hide behind the H.N.P. They are allies these days &#x2026; (Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we have never before seen the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, the main speaker on labour matters on the Government side, floundering about so. He was on the defence all the time. He kicked up a little dust and then broached a local matter, which had absolutely nothing to do with the matter my hon. colleague broached. When his time was almost up, he referred again to this side of the House. We have never seen anything like it before.</p>

<p>I should like to return to certain arguments advanced by the hon. member for Yeoville. This labour shortage in South Africa has without doubt assumed serious proportions now. Scarcely a day passes without some authority or other in this field issuing us with serious warnings. Things cannot go on like this. We dare not delay any longer in regard to this matter. We must now face facts and act accordingly. It is becoming absolutely clear to more and more people in this country that the labour policy of the Government, if it ever was a coherent policy, has failed completely. In fact, the Government itself is now demolishing its own labour pattern. The Government has now reached the point where it has to admit candidly that it has led South Africa astray in the field of <span class="col_6915-6916" refersTo="page_0591"/>labour. If it does that, it must also have the moral courage to effect the necessary changes. If the Government is not capable of doing that, it should stand back and make way for another government which is in fact able to effect these changes.</p>

<p>It is clear that this Government, as a result of its short-sighted policy, has failed in three important respects. In the first place they have failed in regard to the White workers. The hon. member for Yeoville is quite right when he says that the Government only pretends that it is protecting the interests of our White workers, for in reality it is clear that the Government is undermining the long-term interests of our White workers. In terms of its own policy the Government is affording the White workers no real protection. That protection is nothing but a fiction and an illusion. Now, we want to ask a further question: To what extent is the Government preparing our White workers for the long-term adjustments which will be necessary for them in order to adapt to the modern technological age? Sir, we can put the Government&#x2019;s policy to the test so easily. We can challenge this Minister, as I am now doing, to apply his labour policy of work reservation, in all its harsh reality. What will he do then? He will react as he reacted on previous occasions. In the first place he will ask: &#x201C;Where must I get the Whites from to take over from these non-Whites? What must I do with the non-Whites who are going to be relieved from their posts in this way?" And when he does that, he will say that it is irresponsible to put such a matter to the Government. But it is not irresponsible to do this. This is after all an irresponsible policy presented to us by an irresponsible Government. Otherwise it would surely be impossible for him to react to it in that way. When it suits the Government, as was recently the position in the Transvaal in regard to the building groups, they jettison their entire policy, although they keep on saying that work reservation is an irrevocable cornerstone of their entire labour policy. It may be a cornerstone. But what they do not tell us, is that the house they are constructing, is built on sand. That house is falling to pieces here before our very eyes.</p>

<p>It is very clear what the Government is doing in terms of its present labour policy as far as the White workers are concerned. As the hon. member for Yeoville said, they are in the first place confining our White workers to certain types of work, when they are capable of doing better work and are in fact capable of earning better wages. I want to say at once that we on this side of the House will not do it in this way. We believe that our White workers are entitled to a better dispensation. We shall create opportunities for them so that hey can move upwards. What is the second thing the Government is doing with its policy? They are asking our While workers to work overtime on a basis as we have seldom seen before. Mr. Tom Murray recently pointed out that thousands and thousands of our White workers are working up to 20 hours overtime per week. And what does that mean? That means that those workers will complete a whole year&#x2019;s work within six-tenths of the year, ft means that those workers complete a whole lifetime of work before they are 50 years old. We think that this is an unjustified burden which is being placed on our White workers by the Government with its policy. We will not ask them to make sacrifices of this kind.</p>

<p>But now we ask the Government what training they are giving and to what extent they are preparing our White workers for the adjustments which lie ahead? Recently the Government made an adjustment to its own Act. Apart from apprentices, whom we have been training for years already, I want to put this specific question to the hon. the Minister: How many of our present workers corps benefitted and to what extent, from the Act which the Government piloted through a year or more ago? Our standpoint is different. We shall introduce a purposeful training programme for all our workers in South Africa. We shall also establish a national manpower advisory council to help to bring about coordination. Recently the hon. the Minister referred very derogatively to the &#x201C;crash programmes&#x201D;. Now his own colleague has said precisely the same thing in Bloemfontein, however, only, as usual, to abandon it again. The difficulty is that the Government is not in earnest in regard to this matter. It is trying to play politics. It is continually trying to evade the actual problem. In this way South Africa has last 20 valuable years, years which we could barely afford to lose.</p>

<p>But in the second place the Government has failed in this regard because it is not improving the lot of the non-White workers. The skilled work which is at present being done by non-Whites, is being done despite the Government&#x2019;s policy and not as <span class="col_6917-6918" refersTo="page_0592"/>a result of it. But this hon. Minister is after all not only Minister of White labour. He is Minister or all forms of labour. When a man like Prof. Sadie claims that there are more than a million Bantu who, although technically-speaking they are not unemployed, have an income which is so limited that they must for all practical purposes be regarded as unemployed, then we ask the hon. the Minister: What is he doing about this? Is it not his task to create avenues of employment? But his colleague, the hon. the Minister of Planning, is forcing non-Whites out of thousands and thousands of avenues of employment, while the hon. the Minister of Bantu Affairs is relieving non-Whites who already occupy posts, of those posts. What is his standpoint as Minister of Labour? What is he doing about this problem?</p>

<p>In the third place the Government has failed South Africa itself because it is with the short sighted approach putting a brake on our entire economic progress. Why do we have inflation today? Why is the cost of living soaring? Why do we have to pay taxes which are as high as those in any other country in the world? The replies to all these questions are the same: It is because the Government refuses to ensure the optimal utilization of our human resources in South Africa. They are aware of this. The first economic development programme which appeared in 1964 indicated clearly that its purpose was to indicate where bottlenecks would occur in our economy. Every specific programme which has appeared since 1964 has indicated the lack of skilled labour to be the principle bottleneck. Now, our charge against the Government is this: What has it done about it? We cannot go on like this. The Government has had 20 years to place our labour on a proper basis. All we have had from the Government is a house built on sand, which is falling to pieces here before our very eyes.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow repeatedly levels the accusation at this side of the House and the hon. the Minister that our labour policy has failed. But that is not so. Why is there labour peace and quiet in South Africa? I challenge the hon. member for Hillbrow to mention any other country in the world whose record can be compared with the record of this country. Why do hon. members say that the Whites are being held back as a result of our policy, while they say in that yellow booklet of theirs which they are now trying to hide away, &#x201C;You want it, we have it&#x201D;&#x2014; and after the election &#x201C;We have had it&#x201D;&#x2014; that they give the White workers in South Africa the guarantee that they will during the next 10 years not receive a smaller wage than they are receiving today? Any White worker who read that yellow booklet, rejected the United Party.</p>

<p>The third aspect of this matter to which I want to refer, is the Bantu matter. The hon. member for Yeoville, the main speaker on that side of the House, has just made a tremendous attack on border industries. That same party professes to believe in decentralization. The Bantu will be afforded every opportunity in their homelands in terms of the policy of this national Party. That is what the hon. members for Hillbrow and Yeoville are opposed to. They believe in economic integration and, ultimately, social integration.</p>

<p>I withdraw it. I should very much like to analyse the hon. member for Hillbrow&#x2019;s speech which he makes so repeatedly in this House further, but unfortunately the time at my disposal is limited I have another very important aspect I want to deal with. I believe that <span class="col_6919-6920" refersTo="page_0593"/>the labour peace we have in South Africa has a lot to do with our labour laws. I believe our labour laws may be compared with the laws in the rest of the world in this connection. But it is not only attributable to our laws. It is important to realize that it is also attributable to the implementation and the administration of our labour laws. This is being done in an effective way by the hon. the Minister of labour and his Department. As far as I am concerned, the Industrial Reconciliation Act is one of the most important laws in this country because it affords the employer and the employee an opportunity of conducting a dialogue, because it affords the employer and the employee an opportunity of bargaining, because it affords the employer and the employee protection and because it fosters better relationships between employer and employee. Unfortunately the Industrial Conciliation Act is not applicable in the Bantu homelands in regard to the White workers. In my own constituency where tremendous mineral exploitation is taking place in the homelands&#x2014;I am saying this here today&#x2014;I have to deal with this problem that the White workers&#x2014;and there are hundreds of White workers working as mineworkers in the homeland&#x2014;do not enjoy the protection of the Industrial Conciliation Act in the homelands. I want to make a polite request to the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and I have the greatest confidence in the hon. the Minister&#x2014;to the effect that an attempt be made to see whether a solution cannot be found to allow these workers to fall under the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>Now I want to go further and I want to make it very clear here that I support the principle of the training of Bantu in the homelands, whether in the mining industry or any other industry, 100 per cent; I support the policy of the Government as laid down, with the protective conditions in regard to the White workers in those areas. I want to make this very clear, so that there can be no stories told afterwards that I suddenly pleaded for something else. I support the Government 100 per cent in regard to the training of Bantu in their own areas, but the protective conditions established for the White workers&#x2014;and everyone is aware of these conditions&#x2014;are good conditions &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am not on your side at all. All that I am saying is that if we could make the Industrial Conciliation Act applicable to the White mine workers in the homelands, it would set the minds of these people completely at rest; and I shall tell you why. During the past few months it has been my experience that certain politicians were sowing suspicion among these people and implying that we were selling them out. And it was not only the H.N.P. Hon. members of the United Party were doing this, and I was shocked by that. They did it in the provincial election last year. The hon. members for Yeoville and Hilibrow know that their candidate did in the provincial election. You know about one Senator who knows nothing about labour problems. You know who I am talking about, that veldskoen Senator of theirs. He went around hawking his wares and saying that the poor White miners would be deprived of their work and would be replaced. He did not even use the word &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, but used the word which the hon. the member for Point is so fond of using. But hon. members never repudiated him as a party, and that is the type of thing which makes the United Party appear ridiculous in the eyes of the mine workers. You come along and try to catch their votes, but I want to tell you that the White mine workers of South Africa reject you today for that reason. [Interjections.] They reject you as a party. My time is limited. Do not try to waste my lime with interjections. I want to state that the United Party is prepared, when it suits them, to join the H.N.P. in sowing unrest and suspicion among the workers of South Africa, and it is a dangerous game they are playing. The workers of South Africa, with their productivity and the services they have rendered to South Africa, deserve better than that. I have seen evidence of what you did in the provincial elections in my own constituency. The hon. member for Yeoville, as leader of the Transvaal, is aware of the fact that he had to get that candidate to come forward the next day with a different story, but by then the harm had already been done. The correction appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i>, but the poison had been spread that evening in the Agricultural Hall of Rustenburg, and who reads the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i></p>

<p>No, but you did not repudiate him, and you are the Transvaal leader of the United Party. I want to say this, however, as far as the labour pattern is concerned. Last year, under the Mines Vote, we discussed the entire homelands matter here with a sense of responsibility. I thought that a sense of responsibility was perhaps being revealed here, but shortly afterwards, when an opportunity presented itself to exploit the situation, the United Party came along and sowed suspicion. They were the cause of innocent people moving out of that area out of fear. Those people will never forget their deeds. This party, on the other hand, looks after the interests of the White workers in South Africa. I should like to make this request to the hon. the Minister. [Interjections.] Sir, that hon. member is still wet behind the ears. He must first acquire a little commonsense between his ears instead of the bush of hair he is growing.

<p>Sir, we have observed a new phenomenon here today. The second speaker on the Government side is also shying away from the crucial issues that we are dealing with here. In fact just to demonstrate the interest on that side of the House in labour matters, the crucial matter in South Africa, look at the situation here before me; hon. members opposite are conspicuous by their absence. Sir, that hon. gentleman made only one comment of consequence, and that was an appeal to the hon. the Minister to make the Industrial Conciliation Act applicable to the Bantu homelands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bodenstein">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. BODENSTEIN</person>:</from>

<p>To the Europeans.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>That has been our policy for years. If he feels that that will bring peace of mind to the workers and to hon. gentlemen on that side, then all that he has to do is to follow our programme. Sir, beyond that, the hon. gentleman raised so many platitudes which are so far removed from reality that I do not think there is any sense in responding to them. I want rather to return to the issues which I have raised here before.</p>

<p>There are important developments in the economic and labour fields in South Africa at the moment of which the Government does not seem to be aware. Indeed it looks as though the Government has a complete blind spot on so many of these issues. I feel that they have repercussions that go well beyond the field of labour and therefore it is necessary that these issues should be raised here.</p>

<p>Probably the most important single issue at the present time is that there should be rapid economic advancement for the non-White people of South Africa. Every single attitude survey that has been done shows that the non-White peoples of South Africa want two things; they want decent economic opportunities for themselves and they want proper education for their children. They are not clamouring for political rights at this stage. These are the things that are meaningful to them. When the people wanted bread at the time of the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette said, &#x201C;Give them cake&#x201D;, and when the non-White peoples of South Africa want jobs and opportunities for economic development, they are given national anthems and flags and a host of political trappings which are of no consequence. This new militancy, this new hostility, that is observable amongst our non-White people and that is gaining impetus every day, can be traced back directly to the fact that these people are being denied opportunities for proper economic development. When you stifle the legitimate aspirations of people in the economic sense, then they invariably turn to the political weapon and to the vote as a means towards an end.</p>

<p>Sir, there is a second important factor that we must accept. South Africa has one <span class="col_6923-6924" refersTo="page_0595"/>economy only. There is not a White economy and a Black economy; it is one economy; it is like our currency; we do not have White money and Black money. There is one economy only, and within this we will have to accommodate all people. Sir, there is ample scope for all or us to advance within this one economy, because we need the non-Whites today in much the same way as they need us.</p>

<p>But the third important factor from which we cannot escape is that the whole labour structure is changing. Sir, the Government is inclined to think of our labour structure as being represented by a pyramid consisting of a small group of highly skilled people at the top and a large mass of undifferentiated unskilled people at the bottom. It does not in the least look like that. The South African labour pattern could probably be better represented as a diamond. The large mass of people have moved up; they are no longer on the base line. Exactly the same thing happened in the United States of America. Some 30 years ago they had more than 30 per cent of the workers who were completely unskilled. Today it is only 14 per cent and it is diminishing even further. Exactly the same thing is happening in South Africa. Therefore the need for human skills is increasing all the time.</p>

<p>The fourth important development in South Africa is that the White people of South Africa are opting out of the industrial sector. They want white-collar jobs. To a lesser extent this also applies to the Coloureds and the Indians.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#brandt">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. BRANDT</person>:</from>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jacobs">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. JACOBS</person>:</from>

<p>That hon. member is making funny noises, but he should begin to look at the statistics. Some couple of years ago 30 per cent of the White workers in South Africa were engaged in industry in blue-collar jobs. Do hon. members know how many there are at the present time? Only 16 per cent of White South African workers are in those jobs. Who accounts for the remainder? Seventy-two per cent of the people in industrial jobs today are Black. These are things which we cannot argue away. What does the Government do about training them for these jobs? They are building universities for Black and other non-White people of the country, but they have a strange aversion to building technical training institutions for them. That is what they need. There are immense developments in this field and the number of people required for industrial jobs, for blue-collar jobs, will increase by 70 per cent over the next ten years. Based on the present pattern this means that almost 1 000 000 Black people will come in to take up those blue-collar jobs. In the meantime the Government denies that this is happening, while it is quite clear to everybody that in the foreseeable future nearly all these blue-collar jobs in South Africa will be done by Blacks.</p>

<p>Then there is the fifth important point. It is that economic growth in South Africa is still taking place in the existing industrial areas. Dr. Kuschke said only the other day that over the next ten years 80 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s industrial expansion will occur in the existing metropolitan areas. Of the remaining 20 per cent, the vast bulk of it will be in so-called border areas which are in fact part of White South Africa. Therefore hon. members opposite must not come with this bluff that the Black people can acquire skills, but that they must exercise those skills in their own homelands. There are no jobs for them in their homelands. The jobs where we need them are in the existing industrial areas.</p>

<p>There is a sixth important point. As you have industrial development, there is a need for more and more services. If this industrial development is here in White South Africa, the services are required here as well. You cannot transfer Johannesburg&#x2019;s sewerage system to a homeland or to a border area. The more advanced we become, the more sophisticated these services become. You cannot do this by using a migratory labour force which is unskilled and untrained. When you come to this stage of economic development, you need a stable, better educated and more sophisticated workforce. The indications are clear that this will have to happen because last year, in 1970, engagement and employment in South Africa increased by 6 per cent. However, output increased by only 5 per cent. This is the consequence of the Government&#x2019;s policy. There is no improvement in our productivity. We now have a negative balance which means that we are moving backwards.</p>

<p>In the seventh sense it is important that we should pay the non-White people more. To persevere with the present situation will bring dire consequences to South Africa. A few years ago, in Soweto, it was determined <span class="col_6925-6926" refersTo="page_0596"/>that 86 per cent of the people were living below the poverty datum line. In 1964 it was determined that the minimum effective level, which is the minimum you require for normal social services, was R83-30 per month. I ask this hon. Minister what proportion of non-White people today are earning more than R83 per month? That estimate was made in 1964 and the cost of living has gone up considerably since then. In most other established communities the difference between skilled and unskilled work payments is in the region of 20 per cent to 30 per cent In South Africa, in several cases, it is several hundred per cent. How can we allow a situation like this to continue? In order to cope with this there must be a greater degree of mobility not only in the vertical sense, with non-Whites moving into these more skilled jobs, but there must also be lateral mobility, we must move more and more from agriculture to industry. In the higher industrialized communities like America, agriculture accounts for five per cent, of the workforce in Japan four per cent and in South Africa the figure is 30 per cent. All this must be done, and we therefore ask what the plans of the Government are. What are they doing about it? We are left with the conclusion that they have no idea that these things are even happening. [Time expired,]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Opposition&#x2019;s mentor, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, tackled them yesterday by saying that as from today they had to fight in this debate as they had done last week; they had to fight like tigers and the sparks had to fly. I am afraid that if the Opposition does not get cracking now, that Sunday paper is not going to be very satisfied with them. One of the reasons why they are not yet in the gear in which their mentor wants them to be&#x2014;and there are several other reasons as well&#x2014;is of course the fact that in South Africa things are going so well for the labour corps. It is for this reason that they cannot make the sparks fly. This is one of the numerous reasons why it has not been possible for us to have the attack which the <i>Sunday Times</i> wanted to have. As far as the whole is concerned, before we come to file particular, it is interesting when we take a look at our employment position in South Africa and contrast it with just two other countries, which, to a certain extent, bear a relation to us, namely England and America. In England there is at the moment a considerable and increasing rate of unemployment, and according to the latest publication there are 5175 000 unemployed persons in America, i.e. an increase of 39 per cent on last year. Let us now examine our own unemployment position. As far as White men and young men are concerned, our unemployment position is 0,01 per cent, and in respect of all groups, namely Whites, Coloureds and Indians, men and women, the unemployment position is 0,5 per cent. One can therefore appreciate why this attack of the United Party is falling so flat at the moment. This is but one of the reasons. The labour position in South Africa is such that shortages do exist. This is a matter which no Government body and no member on this side of the House has ever denied. We would rather have these shortages than have a state of unemployment such as they have in England or in America. If we had those conditions, we would have in this country a powder-keg of dissatisfaction, which would be unbearable to everyone of us. Actually, this tendency towards growth is something about which few people can complain. I just want to mention a few figures taken from the return of the economic development programme. Over the six-year period from 1963, the base year for the economic development programme, to 1969, the volume of factory production increased on an average by 8,4 per cent as against a target rate of 6,8 per cent. I grant that this made a tremendous onslaught on our manpower position. However, the position in regard to our manpower is anything but as gloomy and sombre as the United Party would like to suggest. We are watching the manpower position very carefully, and the research projects carried out in order to determine it, have indicated that according to an estimate the demand for White manpower will come to 1 112 200 in 1973. According to this estimate the supply will be 1 134 850, i.e, a surplus of 22 650. This estimate is based on an average growth rate of 5&#x00BD; per cent per year, an average increase of 2,9 per cent per year and a net immigration figure of 31 600 per year, of whom 11 050 men and 3 400 women will be economically active. But we find this continuous nagging about the manpower shortage. That is why it is a good thing for one to retain one&#x2019;s perspective in regard to this matter as well. An article published recently sheds a rather most interesting light on this question of the manpower shortage. I just want to refer <span class="col_6927-6928" refersTo="page_0597"/>to it briefly. It is an article which appeared in <i>The Star</i> of 1st April, 1971, under the heading &#x201C;Hollard Street Journal&#x201D;. This appeared under the heading &#x201C;How much myth in the manpower shortage?&#x201D; They pointed out that a proper analysis had been made of various industries, including the clothing industry. Then they arrived at a very interesting conclusion. They Said-</p>

<block name="quote">Taking only one example, the National Productivity Institute has reckoned that the clothing industry would have no labour shortage at all at the moment if only it had increased productivity by a modest 2,2 per cent over the last few years, while now it complains of a shortage of 8 000 workers.</block>

<p>Then they went on to express this very illuminating opinion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, there is an increasing suspicion that the overall manpower crisis in South Africa could be cut down to much smaller dimensions if more companies were prepared to grasp the nettles of productivity.</block>

<p>I cannot phrase this better, nor can I emphasize it more strongly. In fact, this is the plea which numerous members on this side and I have been making year in and year out, i.e. that the employer should take the initiative in introducing and carrying through those productivity projects in their factories and businesses. It is not the task of the State to enter every factory and introduce productivity schemes there. We can express the wish and take the lead by making some of our officials available, as we rightly do, but it is and remains the principal and primary task of these industrialists themselves to contribute their share.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? May I ask the Minister whether he accepts the premise of that argument as he stated it there? Is that also his view?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Of course I accept the argument that we can enhance productivity a great deal more if more is done towards training the people in one&#x2019;s service in the direction of higher productivity. That is the crux of this matter, the point which this article makes, [Interjection.] Listen now. They referred to the clothing industry. They said that if they had only increased the percentage in the clothing industry by a &#x201C;modest&#x201D; 2,2 per cent, the clothing industry would not have had this shortage of 8 000 at present. This is the statement and the view I endorse. This is an example and should, as it were, be an indication to our industrialists to improve their position according to this concept of self-production.</p>

<p>But before coming back to some of the standpoints taken up by the Opposition, I just want to refer, first of all, to two matters raised by members on my side.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark referred here to the unhealthy phenomenon of labour brokers trafficking, as it were, in labour. They are doing so to a large extent in the Vanderbijlpark area. What they are actually doing, is to entice workers away from industries and offer their services to other remployers at higher wages. It goes without saying that this is an unhealthy phenomenon, a phenomenon which will undermine the stability of the labour market, It also promotes inflation. As this is an irregular and, I can almost say, illegitimate phenomenon, I instructed my department to investigate this matter. It is possible for me to announce now that legal proceedings will be instituted against these people who are peddling labour in this manner.</p>

<p>The hon. member once again raised the question of Republic Day being a paid holiday. At the present moment Republic Day is a public holiday. To the majority of the workers in South Africa Republic Day is therefore a paid holiday, but factory workers and mineworkers have been excluded from this. This year, however, when the 10th anniversary of the Republic is being commemorated, mineworkers and factory workers will, in terms of the previous resolution we adopted, also get Republic Day as a paid holiday. Ever since 1966 representations have been made to the Government for making Republic Day an annual, paid holiday. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark pleaded for that only last year. It was also advocated at congresses of the National Party. In 1968 a deputation of the conservative-minded trade unions discussed this matter with the Prime Minister and myself in Pretoria, and on that occasion they pleaded once again for Republic Day to be an annual, paid holiday for factory workers as well as mineworkers. The Prime Minister informed them that he had every sympathy with their request, but pointed out that it was <span class="col_6929-6930" refersTo="page_0598"/>one of the important objectives of the Republic to become economically strong. The greatest service that could be rendered to the Republic, so he said, was to make it economically strong. But at the same time the Prime Minister promised to make a further announcement in this regard on the occasion of this year&#x2019;s celebrations. That is why I am pleased today to be able to announce that the Government has decided that as from 1972 Republic Day will be an annual, paid holiday for the factory workers and mineworkers as well. Legislation to this effect will be introduced during the course of the present Session. I admit that this concession will entail a loss in production, but to that I want to add that the Government regards Republic Day as being of so much importance that it does not deem this concession to be too high a price.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg raised the position of the White workers in the Bantu homelands, and in his plea he said that those While workers should also be able to enjoy the benefits of the Industrial Conciliation Act; in other words, those White workers in, <i>inter alia</i> that area to which the hon. member referred, should be able to enjoy trade union rights, rights which they have as members of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. That will enable them, for instance, to apply for the establishment of a conciliation board. Let me say at once that it has never been the intention of the Government to deprive our White mineworkers who are working in the Bantu homelands of their right to exercise their legitimate trade union rights. Although a proclamation was issued a year or two ago, a proclamation in which it was stated that the application of the Industrial Conciliation Act was being suspended in respect of the Bantu homelands&#x2014;a suspension which also implied that it could be withdrawn again at any time&#x2014;it has never been the intention of the Government that the Whites employed in the mining industry in the Bantu homelands should be without any conciliation machinery. The actual reason for the suspension of the Industrial Conciliation Act in respect of the Bantu homelands, was mainly that we regarded the Industrial Conciliation Act as being such an advanced labour measure that it did not really belong with the developing Bantu peoples. It was felt that the Bantu homelands should actually make their own labour arrangements in accordance with their own development. At the same time I want to make it very clear that the Government intimated very clearly last year that as far as the Bantu homelands were concerned, the Government was prepared to draw the logical line for the Bantu in their homelands right through to its terminal point. In other words, last year we intimated very clearly to all concerned that, as far as the economic labour position of the Bantu in the Bantu homelands was concerned, we would, in the economic life and in mining industry in their own areas, afford them the opportunity of advancing to the topmost rung.</p>

<p>At the same time the Government has never been prepared to leave the White mineworkers in those areas without their recognized bargaining machinery. In fact, when earlier this year a deputation of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union had talks with me and my colleagues, i.e. the Minister of Bantu Administration and the Minister of Mines, I as the Minister of Labour gave them the assurance that the Government would continue to respect their trade union rights. I told them that if any labour dispute were to arise in the Bantu homelands, a dispute in respect of which a conciliation board could normally be applied for, I would still, through my department, arrange it in that way with those mine authorities. At the beginning of the year I also told the deputation of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union that that was the spirit in which we would administer this suspension, which could be withdrawn at any time. I also gave them the assurance that during the discussion of this Vote I would make the matter known in public. Since then my colleague the Minister of Bantu Administration and I had further discussions on the matter. As a result of those talks we held on this matter, an amending proclamation will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> next Friday. The object of this amending proclamation is to make it clear in no uncertain terms that the White mineworkers in those Bantu homelands may still avail themselves of the machinery of the Industrial Conciliation Act as regards any labour dispute which may arise. In other words, if any dispute were to arise between the White mineworkers and their employers in any Bantu homeland, application may he made for a conciliation board. That request can, as was the case in the past, be complied with. I therefore trust that this statement, together with the amending proclamation, will remove all doubt about the Government&#x2019;s objective. Just as clearly as <span class="col_6931-6932" refersTo="page_0599"/>the Government intimated its objective, i.e. that in their homelands the Bantu may advance to the highest rung, it also wants to inform all parties concerned that the White mineworkers who are working in those areas will still have the existing bargaining machinery at their disposal. The Government considers such an attitude to be fair to the mineworkers and also in the interests of industrial peace, the maintenance of which still remains the responsibility of the Government.</p>

<p>Now I am coming back to the Opposition and the two speakers who have taken part in this debate up to now. I am referring to the two hon. members who received the instruction from the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Amongst other things reference was made to the question of training. Quite dramatically reference was made to the appeal made by my colleague the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs in regard to more training having to be undertaken. This is a plea which I myself have already made on numerous occasions and which I cannot support strongly enough. Then the hon. member for Hillbrow went on to ask what training had been done in this regard. For that reason I should like to furnish certain information, which I hope will convince him that a particularly great deal has been done in this short period. Training funds under the Amendment Act piloted through in 1970, were established by way of ten industrial council agreements in respect of the iron and steel and engineering industry in the whole Republic and the building industry. As far as the latter is concerned, six separate funds were established in various areas. Furthermore, in respect of the clothing industry, one such fund was established for the Cape Peninsula and another for the Transvaal, Such a fund was also established in respect of the motor transport undertaking in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>At every meeting of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council a report is made on the progress made with these training schemes. The Government and this body are devoting the maximum attention to the progress of these schemes and, as a result, progress is being made. Now I want to mention one single fact in regard to apprentices.</p>

<p>I am furnishing other information now. Does the hon. member not want to hear something positive as well? Or does he only care for negative stories? After all, that is what the hon. member supplies to the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Surely, it is not my task to supply the hon. member with such stories. The hon. member should do so himself. Let me furnish these positive facts. During 1970 the number of apprentices enrolled was 1490 more than the figure for 1969. It is true that there is a tremendous demand for the labour of these young people. But it is also significant that there has been an improvement in the number of enrolments. This has been possible because the conditions for apprenticeship are gradually being adjusted to the requirements of the times.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to one particular matter, which was raised by the hon. member for Yeoville. The hon. member for Yeoville once again raised the question of the clothing industry and the border areas. Of course, basically the hon. member is opposed to border area development. To him and to the United Party there is only one single thing, i.e. to utilize the &#x201C;available manpower&#x201D; in the metropolitan areas. This is the United Party&#x2019;s express premise. That is why they have no liking for the border areas and that is why they are disparaging and denigrating border areas to the limit. But let me just say this to these hon. gentlemen. It is true that at the moment there are only approximately 80 000 in the border areas. However, in regard to this matter, too, it will interest the hon. member for Hillbrow to know that in the years that lie ahead we shall be able to mention progessively better and larger figures because this border area policy is now gathering momentum, and decisions which the Government will announce in this regard before long, will prove that it is in fact going to be the asset to us which we expect to have.</p>

<p>It will be wherever there are Bantu homelands. There it will come into being.

After all, this is another positive matter.</p>

<p>But let me now come back to this question of the clothing industry. It is true that the Wage Board investigates the clothing industry from time to time. Over the past few years it did so on a number of occasions, and at the moment the Wage Board is investigating the bargaining position of this clothing industry once again, because the one thing we shall definitely uphold at all times, is that these border industries will not become unfair competition to the established industries in the metropolitan areas. This is a premise which we have been stating over and again, and because we are in earnest, this matter is once again being investigated at the moment.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>They investigate all matters, and if the hon. member&#x2019;s case is at all a substantiated one, he can submit it to this board and it will be investigated properly. But let me say this. The hon. member for Yeoville rose here today and started by; saying that I had to take the country into my confidence in regard to our labour policy. In that regard we on this side have no difficulty. The policy of this Government is crystal-clear to everybody who wants to listen to it. Our policy in this country is that of protecting the White worker. It seeks to effect controlled employment In this country, and not to open the flood-gates, as the United Party wants to do, to an uncontrolled inflow of Black workers into the White areas. [Interjections.] That is our policy, and with that policy we shall proceed.</p>

<p>But what policy do we get from the United Party? I think that whereas they want us to take the country into our confidence, which we are in fact doing, it is, after all, also necessary for the United Party to take the country into its confidence as to their objectives and how they want to carry out their plans. If the United Party&#x2014;and the hon. member for Yeoville, to be specific &#x2014;tells us that we should take the country into our confidence in regard to our plans, surely we are justified and have good reason, to ask when the United Party is going to start taking the country into its confidence in regard to its plans. When is the United Party going to rise in this House and give us an honest and frank analysis of the effect of the abolition of job reservation, to which the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Hillbrow have now committed themselves repeatedly? When are they going to rise in this House and give us an explanation in that regard? [Interjections] You, who continually rise here and want job reservation to be abolished, would you now, on this occasion, inform us as to what your plans are and how that abolition of job reservation is to improve the position of the Whites in this country?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in stating the case in this House, said that, once they had abolished job reservation, the safeguards referred to by the United Party would be that instead of job reservation they would give the workers other guarantees, which they believed would be more effective than section 77. Now, this sounds very good, but how are they going to implement it? They say that they will, in the first place, entrust those guarantees to the trade unions. These guarantees are now to be entrusted to the trade unions, but what is the position of the trade unions in this country? Tucsa controls 50 per cent of the trade unions. The mixed trade unions, the Coloured trade unions and the Indian trade unions are affiliated with Tucsa, and the result is that Tucsa can speak on behalf of approximately 50 per cent of the organized workers in this country. It is the T.U.C. which has been attacking the Government in season and out for not wanting to permit non-Whites&#x2014;Blacks, to be specific&#x2014;to enter skilled spheres of employment in White employment areas. These are the people who are now going to be consulted. Sir, will the United Party take us into their confidence and tell us how they will proceed once they have abolished section 77 and when they are going to consult the T.U.C.; what protection is that going to afford White workers in South Africa? Will the United Party have the courage to rise in this House and to tell us how they will protect the White workers after they will have abolished the statutory job reservation and consulted the T.U.C.&#x2014;these people who are so liberal that they are actually <span class="col_6935-6936" refersTo="page_0601"/>pink? Is that the protection which the United Party wants to afford the White workers? We are being told&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said this on a previous occasion&#x2014;that the only instrument for combating inflation is the greater utilization of all available labour. Sir, what would happen if we were to combat inflation by these means, by abolishing job reservation, as we once again heard here today? According to the United Party job reservation is the thing which stands in the way of the Whites, who should supposedly rise to higher positions. They are supposed to rise so high that they will come out of the chimney like smoke. I think that the United Party should take this House into their confidence and tell us how they want to combat inflation once they have abolished job reservation. How are they going to combat inflation once they will have managed to get the Whites out of the way, either through the back door or through the chimney? How are they going to bring about this U.P. Canaan? Surely, Sir, before one has this U.P. Canaan, one should expect the White workers to rise in revolt under this U.P. recipe. The White workers have brought industrial peace to South Africa, because they have confidence in the National Party&#x2019;s labour policy. This is the main reason why we have this industrial peace in South Africa today. But if one took that job security away from them and, over against that, put into operation the United Party&#x2019;s policy, i.e. the abolition of job reservation, what recourse would one&#x2019;s workers in this country have other than resorting to the only remaining weapon, namely that of strikes? I want to ask the United Party these questions: Is that how they want to combat inflation? Is that how they think they will be able to bring about increased productivity in this country? Sir, I am glad that there are still a number of hours left for this debate; I am going to listen with interest in order to hear whether the United Party is taking the country into its confidence on this cardinal question.</p>

<speech by="#rossouw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. J. C. ROSSOUW</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say thank you to the hon. the Minister for his announcement that in future the 31st May will be a holiday for both mine and steel workers. Sir, we were very glad to hear about this, but what struck me is that when the Minister made this announcement the United Party members were as silent as the grave, while this side of the House said &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; Sir, through you I want to ask the United Party whether there are no United Party supporters working in the mines and in the steel industries that will now also be able to celebrate Republic Day from this year onwards. But as they have always maintained their silence at the call of the worker, so have they maintained their silence and will they maintain it in the future.</p>

<p>From the speeches of the two hon. Opposition members who took part in this debate this afternoon, it is very clear that they are pursuing an open labour market for Whites and non-Whites. I accept the fact that this is their policy. This Opposition always sits on the touchline of the football field. They are always the best judges of the game because they sit on the edge of the field and in the pavilion. But they never really take part in the game. But if they do take part in the game, they do exactly what they have done here today. They throw open the sluices for Whites and non-Whites in all the jobs in this country.</p>

<p>We have peace and quiet in this country. Why do we have peace and quiet? It is because the National Party is honest in its conduct, not only towards the White worker, not only because it is protecting what accrues to the White worker, but also because it is honest towards the non-White worker. In the past decade various opportunities have been created for the non-Whites. When I speak of the non-Whites, I am speaking of the Bantu. I am not even mentioning the Coloureds, who have been trained for many decades and who form a worthy part of the building industry in this country today. I am thinking of the Bantu trained by us, not only as construction workers, not only as electricians, but also in various other spheres so that one day they can work with their own people and be of great benefit to them. That is why the Bantu have, to a large extent, built their own Bantu townships and even laid on the electricity. They themselves did all the work that was usually done by the White artisans. These are opportunities the National Party created for the Bantu years ago in order to educate him so that he can also be a fully- fledged artisan in his area and at a later stage in his homeland. We did not flinch from the problems we were faced with and neither shall We flinch from future problems.</p>

<p><span class="col_6937-6938" refersTo="page_0602"/>But let us analyse the speeches of the hon. members for Yeoville and Hillbrow. If we analyse those speeches, it is clear that they have a policy of &#x201C;fling the doors wide&#x201D;. They have thrown in the towel long ago. They themselves do not know what they envisage. But if one has listened thus to the hon. member for Hillbrow, it is clear that he read yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times.</i> The hon. member is now doing something he has never done before. He makes so many gestures with his hands that I am sure that he is practising for television. But it was another Jacobs and another member for Hillbrow that we saw today. I want to tell him that he succeeded fairly well. If the gestures he makes with his hands and fingers and his handclapping make as much of an impression as his speech, his policy could perhaps succeed one day, possibly on a television programme.</p>

<p>The Bantu, the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indians are being looked after. It was said here a while ago&#x2014;and the hon. member for Hillbrow also said so&#x2014;that we are building universities, but no technical colleges where these people can be trained. I just want to know whether the hon. members have read reports in that connection. Apparently they have not. If they had done so, they would have seen that the aforementioned institutions have been established and that the people can be trained there.</p>

<p>No, let us now be frank and say that those hon. members are as scared of homeland development as the devil is of holy water. They are afraid it is going to succeed, but the proofs of that success are already there. We heard an announcement in that connection today. It will succeed and we surely do have faith in that. The difference between the National Party and the United Party is that the one has faith in what it believes to be right, while the other only gropes around in the dark without any sense of direction and is consequently always lost. That is the reason why the voice of the public has, for the past twenty years, rejected that side of the House at the polls every time. They were rejected because what they say here in the House of Assembly differs from what they say in Johannesburg, Hillbrow and Houghton. I want to ask another question. If these hon. members are all that honest with their policy, and if they see so great a danber, i.e. that we will succumb because we do not want to accede to their labour policy, I challenge them to be brave enough, once in the year 1971, and have the courage to nominate a candidate in Waterberg. Then it will be on record that the hon. members had the courage to nominate a candidate in Waterberg. Do it now! We have nominated one. Adries Treurnicht, but now those hon. members are fighting under the banner of Jaap Marais.</p>

We are honest as far as our policy is concerned, and when we take a stand in respect of any race group whatever, we are honest with them. We believe, and we are convinced, that these people still have to learn a great deal, and here I mean the Bantu, the Coloureds and the Indians in particular, who still have to learn a great deal because they have a great backlog to catch up on, and who should be given the opportunity to catch up on that backlog. They must be given the opportunity to qualify so that they can make a better living in this country. There is work for everyone in this country. There is not such a big labour shortage. We only hear about a big labour shortage from the United Party; it is a labour shortage that they create. This labour shortage is not nearly that big. I want to say again that the person who does not work today, whatever race he may belong to, is the person who does not want to work.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do so wish with all my heart that thousands, tens of thousands of the workers of South Africa could have listened today to the hon. the Minister and to the two previous speakers on that side. Once and for all that party opposite would have been exposed as not the friend, but the enemy of the worker in South Africa. The hon. member for Stilfontein also spoke, but the reflex action we are always getting from members on that side was strangely absent, for there was no thanks to the hon. the Minister. He did not thank the hon. the Minister for what he had said in connection with the partial application of the Industrial Conciliation Act in the homelands at the moment, of which the hon. member for Rustenburg had spoken. The hon. member for Rustenburg does not seem very grateful either. And why not? The first reason is that it has always been the policy of the United Party that we have one economy in this country, in other words, according to our policy the Industrial Conciliation Act should always have been applied in the Bantu areas as well. This has been and is our policy and now, years behind the time, the hon. member for Rustenburg also asks for it. The hon. the Minister also came along with a watered-down version of it and the hon. member for Stilfontein did not have a word of thanks for it either. Why was there no word of thanks? How is the hon. the Minister going to explain his words where he said that the Industrial Conciliation Act was going to be applied in those areas, in other words, section 77 as well, which deals with job reservation, but said almost in the same breath that the Bantu in those areas can rise to the top rung in the mining industry? I do not understand the contradiction in that observation by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>The second matter that the hon. the Minister thought would give his followers cause for gratitude was when he said that Republic Day would in future be made a paid holiday for all workers. But does he not remember how the United Party has been asking for it year after year for five years and even longer, how it has always been part of our policy, and also how it has been refused by that side of the House? Therefore it is no wonder that there was not one word of thanks for that from the hon. member for Stilfontein.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also made great play here of job reservation, which is supposed to offer the White worker of South Africa such great protection, and wanted to know what our attitude was in regard to that. Does the hon. the Minister still not know that job reservation story of his is the greatest political bluff ever perpetrated against the White worker of South Africa? What percentage of the White workers are affected by job reservation&#x2014;50 per cent, 40 per cent, 30 per cent, 20 per cent or 10 per cent? No, not even 5 per cent. Ninety-five per cent of our White workers are not covered by job reservation. In spite of this the hon. the Minister says that the White worker in South Africa would be ruined if job reservation were to disappear.</p>

<speech by="#henning">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. M. HENNING</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, not in a ten-minute speech. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s confidence in section 77 of the Industrial Conciliation Act is evident from his own deeds. He is undermining job reservation by making numerous exceptions in connection with it. He himself admits that the way in which he applies job reservation is totally undesirable. Then the hon. the Minister wants to tell us that the workers in South Africa are doing well. They are doing badly, as is every citizen in South Africa who has to suffer under the excessive taxation, the high sales tax and the new burdens amounting to R168 million which were mentioned by the hon. member for Yeoville. Wage increases are of no value if they are all swallowed up by the higher cost of living resulting from the policy of this Government.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the hon. the Minister tried to prove by means of statistics that employment opportunities in South Africa are better than in other countries. His argument seems to be that there is less unemployment in South Africa than in those countries. I want to tell the Minister that his Government has no proper and adequate statistics in connection with unemployment <span class="col_6941-6942" refersTo="page_0604"/>in South Africa. It has practically none in connection with the unemployment figures for the Bantu. I should like to inquire of the hon. the Minister what acceptable statistics there are in connection with unemployment among the Bantu today. The only statistics in connection with White unemployment are those in the hands of a few labour bureaux. They do not even cover the whole country either. No comparison can be drawn between the unemployment figure in our country and that in other countries. Besides, we must always remember that we have a growing economy in which there ought to be no unemployment, while Britain and America have established and in many respects almost stagnant economies.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Minister actually tries to tell us that the shortage of manpower in South Africa is not so serious, and he quotes one or two authorities. Why does he not rather quote the people who are concerned with that manpower shortage, for example the industrialist, the factory owner, the men who are struggling to find employees, the men who approach us Members of Parliament to take deputations to Pretoria and to the Department of Bantu Administration to ask for more workers to be found for them, otherwise their factories will deteriorate. Why does the hon. the Minister not ask persons who are not favourably disposed toward his party? Why does he not ask Mr. De Vries of the Bureau for Economic Research of Stellenbosch, quoted by my hon. friend the member for Yeoville. Why does he not ask Mr. Jan Marais of the Trust Bank, of Dawie de Villiers of Sasol? Why does he not read <i>Volkshandel?</i> Why does he not ask the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut? Even the National Institute for Personnel Research of the C.S.I.R. has investigated this problem of labour in South Africa. I should like to inquire of the Minister whether he has read their findings as well.</p>

<p>Then I strongly object to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s blaming the industrialists of South Africa for the lack of growth and productivity and the difficulty in connection with the labour problem in South Africa. The industrialists of South Africa are not the ones who passed the Physical Planning Act. The industrialists of South Africa are not the ones who say that the Bantu have to be sent away and sent back to the reserves and the border areas. The Government alone is to blame for the fact that we have this tremendous crisis in South Africa today.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it is the policy of the United Party, on the other hand, to open the flood-gates and to allow the uncontrolled influx of labour to the large cities. But surely, Sir, it is absolute nonsense to say that this is our policy. We have always said that we believe in influx control, that we believe that it also offers the Bantu worker in the cities protection against the influx of cheap labour. It is out of ignorance that the hon. the Minister levelled that charge at this side, namely that we want to open the flood-gates. But now I want to state here that if any member on that side of the House repeats that charge after this, he will be telling a lie. Now they know what the position is. I hope they will not tell that lie.</p>

<p>We find ourselves today in one of the greatest labour crises we have ever had in our country. It is a labour crisis, although of a different nature than the second greatest one we have had, namely in the depression period in the thirties, when there was also a Nationalist Party Government in power. But this is a different kind of labour crisis. There is a tremendous shortage of White workers, a shortage of 150 000; as regards engineers alone, there is a shortage of 1 000 in the country, but on the other hand there are tens of thousands of unemployed in the homelands, to such an extent that the Chief Minister of the Transkei has to say; &#x201C;Please do not send any more Bantu to the Transkei, because there is no work for them in that area.&#x201D; This is the way that the Government&#x2019;s policy is functioning today. Productivity is lagging. The machine of our economy is squeaking, creaking, knocking and grinding to a halt. And in the meanwhile the hon. the Minister is throwing sand into the machinery. There is the Minister of Economic Affairs, who gives the country 98 octane petrol, but the economy only 50 octane. There is the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, who breaks off parts of that machine and tries ever harder to destroy it. No wonder our economy is going to rack and ruin today!

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. S. AUCAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, since I am making my maiden speech in this House, I believe you will allow me to associate myself briefly with the fitting tributes already paid in this House to the <span class="col_6943-6944" refersTo="page_0605"/>memory of my predecessor, the late Minister Basie van Rensburg, What was said of him also reflected the feelings of his constituents, with whom he was associated over a period of almost 18 years. His constituents knew him as someone who was humble in his greatness. This quality one does not acquire through wisdom, diligence and brain-power alone. His greatness and strength were founded on an unshakeable faith and his endeavours were towards a noble end, not for worldly praise, tribute or glory, Out of an inner conviction he performed his life&#x2019;s work humbly but with the greatest devotion and earnestness. This is the way his constituents knew him. Therefore, mindful of my own limited abilities as compared with the great qualities which he possessed, I realize the magnitude of the task resting upon my shoulders in having to attend to the interests of the same constituents, whom I am now representing here.</p>

<p>I should not like to venture discussing the points at issue in this debate. I would rather uphold the good traditions of the past here. Particularly in view of the lively note just introduced into this debate by the hon. member for Orange Grove I would not venture to discuss these matters. Consequently I believe the hon. member will understand why I am not going to respond to his speech.</p>

<p>Sir, from time to time concern is expressed about the productivity of the White workers in South Africa. Government bodies, employers, economists, and even members of this House, as well as all who are interested in labour in this country, express themselves and voice their opinions on this matter. When we reflect on the productivity of our labour force, we must be clear in our minds as to where the emphasis should be placed. Employers and employees form a unit in the determination of the productivity of the labour force. It would therefore be wrong to place the emphasis on either the employers or the employees alone. After all that has been said and written on this subject, I am afraid the impression exists that the spotlight only falls on the employees of this country as far as greater productivity is concerned. The right attitude of the worker towards labour is, of course, a basic factor which determines the standard of productivity. An industry can have sufficient capital and the best and most efficient equipment at its disposal, but if the attitude of its manpower is negative and indifferent, such an industry might as well write off the possibility of success. However, the economic growth and development that South Africa has experienced over the years belie the impression that the White workers of South Africa display a wrong and negative attitude towards labour. They deserve full credit for South Africa&#x2019;s achievement in the economic sphere. A country such as South Africa, which is faced with a manpower shortage, should, however, endeavour to obtain the highest productivity from its workers. With the right attitude towards labour, knowledge and skill remain cornerstones for stimulating productivity. In the first place it is the task of the authorities by means of their labour arrangements to create the climate which will cultivate and encourage the right attitude on the part of the workers. The labour peace and quiet among the workers of South Africa is sufficient proof that this climate does exist in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the second place it is the task of the authorities to create or help create the facilities to provide the workers with knowledge and skill. If an analysis is made of State and State-aided institutions established to achieve these objects we find that South Africa is well equipped. At present we have 56 educational institutions which are subsidized by the State, that is to say, four colleges for advanced technical education, 34 technical institutes and 18 schools for special education. In addition there are 59 institutions, including 26 technical colleges, which are fully supported by the State. In addition, I may just mention that the opportunities for university training are unlimited today for those who are able to qualify themselves there for the labour market.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors, however, is the responsibility resting with the employers to enable and encourage the employees to make use of these facilities. Just as the employee must have the correct attitude towards labour, the employer must display the right attitude towards the employee.</p>

<p>I should also like to emphasize the importance of in-service training of the workers in the administrative divisions of the various economic sectors. I am aware of the fact that the Government sector is attaching increasing importance to the training of its administrative labour force. When full justice is done to this aspect of training, the results are forthcoming in the form of high <span class="col_6945-6946" refersTo="page_0606"/>productivity and efficient streamlining and functioning. Only efficient functioning can lead to high productivity and a concomitant saving in labour units. However, what applies to the public sector, also applies to all other industries in the other economic sectors.</p>

<p>I do not want to overlook the fact that there is a large shortage at the moment of qualified and specialized labour units for the purpose of providing training. The fact that the demand far exceeds the supply at the moment, is a good sign of the growing realization that the true value of training in this direction must be appreciated. However, the fact remains that this is a field which is still undeveloped. Emlpoyers should ask themselves whether they are doing enough on their part to encourage the training of staff for teaching purposes and to make it possible for them, to undergo such training. In relation to other vocational groups and in view of the importance of this service, larger numbers of students should attend universities for training. Attention should be paid to greater publicity for this vocation, on the part of employers as well. Heavy demands are being made upon the White workers of South Africa in the intellectual sphere. The best utilization of our intellectual resources is essential in order to meet the demands of the future. This is and will remain the joint responsibility of the Government, the employer and the employee.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like to wish the hon. member who has just sat down everything of the best in his future career in this House and congratulate him on the very moderate and efficient way in which he has delivered his maiden speech.

I should like him to tell us how he proposes to solve the dilemma in which the Government has found itself, namely of promising that the African workers will be allowed to reach the full heights of productivity and of skilled work, while at the same time fulfilling the desire of the White workers in the homelands to maintain their privileged position. Sir, I believe that these two aims are likely to be mutually incompatible and I wait with interest to see what the future is going to bring in this regard. I see everything being passed on to the Industrial Tribunal, which will come back with the suggestion that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained. I wonder how in this way the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration is going to fulfill the promises that he has made to African workers in the Bantu homelands as far as the mines and the jobs which people are permitted to do in the mines, are concerned.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Rustenburg, once again came here with the proposition that South Africa was enjoying peace and quiet, and the hon. the Minister has repeated this as well. I want to issue the warning that I do not think we ought to be quite so sanguine about this situation, because there are definite signs that the growing disparity between the wages of White workers in this country and the wages of non-White workers is leading to increasing discontent. It is no good denying this fact and closing our eyes to it. I do not happen to believe in the ideological theory of a multi-national South Africa, but I certainly see before my eyes evidence that we are two rations in one respect, and that is that we are a nation of &#x201C;haves&#x201D; and a nation of &#x201C;have-nots&#x201D;. There is no doubt that this disparity is growing all the time. If I have time later on. Sir, I would like to quote some figures in this respect to the Committee.</p>

<p>In the meantime I want to raise with the hon. the Minister the very important issue of wage levels amongst those people who are employed in South Africa. There has been a lot of talk about how little unemployment there is in South Africa amongst Whites, Coloureds and Indians. We do not know, as the hon. member for Orange Grove has said, the degree of unemployment among Africans, hut we do know that the wages of those people who are in employment in our industrial areas are far too low to enable them to meet the present cost of living. These people are not only denied the benefits of collective bargaining, but they are always somehow left out when the final wage agreements are reached by industrial councils, or the wages which they ought to be getting are not awarded to them by wage boards or industrial councils. I want to point out that they have to suffer all the effects of inflation, the increased cost of living, sales taxes, <span class="col_6947-6948" refersTo="page_0607"/>higher transport fares, higher bus fares and higher rents. The squeeze is becoming well-nigh unbearable in most of the major cities of South Africa and also&#x2014;a point which we often forget&#x2014;in the smaller towns where the cost of living is not very much lower than it is in the big cities and the wages are often very much lower under wage determinations and wage board agreements.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that the poverty datum line, which has now gone up to R73-42 per month is simply not the wage level which has been reached by the vast majority of unskilled workers in this country. This is obvious from the wage determinations which have been laid down over the last year or so. I know the hon. the Minister is going to tell me that the Bantu Settlement of Disputes Board has managed to get some three or four million rand added to the pay packets of African workers. That is true enough, Sir. He is going to point out to me that in terms of some of the Industrial Council agreements wages have been raised. That is also so, but they have never been raised to such an extent that they have caught up with the increased cost of living. Let us look at the wages which were paid to Africans in construction and manufacturing at the end of 1970. Sir, it was R48 per month in the one case and R50 in the other. This is R1 more than the previous year, and the cost of living has gone up far more than R1 per month since the previous year. I mentioned in the previous debate the absurd wage determinations handed down by the Wage Board for 97 unskilled occupations on the Witwatersrand, whereby they laid down a wage rate of R8-30 per week for male adults, R6-20 for male juveniles and R6-25 for females. I want to give a few more examples of determinations made in the main areas in 1970. In the commercial and distributive trade the amount is R9-20; in the metal-container trade it is R10-35; in sweet manufacturing it is R8-00 and in the chemical industry the amount is R10 per week. In the country districts the amount is as low as R4-60. Industrial council agreements have resulted in iron, steel and engineerings in an amount of R9 45 per week being paid. The highest I could find was in the printing industry, namely an amount of R12-06 per week for an adult male. These householders are just not able to maintain their families at even the poverty datum line which, as we all know, makes no allowance whatsoever for anything but the bare essentials. In fact, the minimum effective level is now considered to be R98. It has increased and is more than the amount the hon. member mentioned. We can take the Johannesburg municipal workers as an example. They are the unskilled workers who form the biggest group of all, and include the pick-and- shovel workers, the street sweepers and the office cleaners. They have recently been awarded the miserable amount of R43-86 per month. The African municipal policemen, who is after all supposed to do a responsible job, has been awarded the wage of R55-29. I could quote examples from industry after industry in this regard. In Natal the wage rates are very low as well. The garment workers recently won a victory by holding a large meeting with the result that their starting wage is now R8-50 per week in one of the categories and R7-50 in another category of unskilled workers.</p>

<p>I do not know why these wage Board and Industrial Council Agreements set these wages. I can only say that this is an historical continuation from the time when every African worker who came into a town was a migrant worker whose family was sustained in some measure or other by what the African homelands could supply them with. This is no longer the case. The vast majority of these workers are either permanently urbanized workers, who have nothing to fall back on as far as the homelands are concerned, or they are migrant workers, and as far as they are concerned, I can tell the hon. the Minister that the homelands supply their families with very little in the way of additional sustenance because of over-population, erosion and over-stocking.</p>

<p>Something must be done by the Government to set a decent wage-level. I know that the answer is going to be that there is no law against paying these workers higher wages. I will be asked, &#x201C;Why do you not tell your rich industrial friends to pay higher wages?&#x201D; I am always interested in this aspect because it is a nice metamorphosis for me. From being the near-communist agitator, I suddenly become the exploiting capitalist. I do not mind that at all. I say it is the Government&#x2019;s duty to set the minimum, decent level at which wages must be maintained. If the Government sets that level, the industrialists will follow suit. They are not philanthropists and will not pay more in wages than their competitors. There are good employers who do this but the <span class="col_6949-6950" refersTo="page_0608"/>majority of employers do not. Therefore it devolves upon the Government to set a decent, minimum living wage below which no one should be employed in South Africa.</p>

<p>In this regard I do not only refer to industrial workers, but I also include farm labourers and mine-workers. Even taking payment in kind into consideration wages paid by both of those major employers of African labour are far too low as well. I do think that something must be done to draw the Wage Boards and Industrial Councils&#x2019; attention to the fact that the wages they are laying down are well below the poverty datum line in the urban areas. If this is not done, we are going to have friction in this country and peace and quiet is not going to be maintained. There is, as I say, a growing, sullen resentment as a result of the fact that there is this obvious disparity in the wages of White skilled workers and the wages of unskilled Black or Coloured workers. It is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility to set the tone and see that something is done in this regard.</p>

<p>I said before that the disparity is increasing all the time. I want to point out that in 1970, according to Dr. Sheila van der Horst, the average wages of Coloureds and Indians in manufacturing and construction were 26 per cent of White wages. Twenty- five years ago they were 40 per cent of White wages. Twenty-five years ago African wages were 25 per cent of White earnings in construction and manufacturing. Last year they were 17 per cent of the White wages. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. POTGTETER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when it comes to the determination of the worker&#x2019;s wages, he always has my sympathy, I cannot verify the figures supplied by the hon. member for Houghton, but I think it would be a very good idea if the hon. member, as far as wage increases are concerned, would turn to that financial giant she has in her party, i.e. Mr. Oppenheimer. I think that if the hon. member would begin with him she would probably have made a great deal of progress as it is. Then she would also be doing the Coloureds and Bantu a service.</p>

<p>Before going further, I first want to refer to the hon. member for Hillbrow, That hon. member asked what protection this party gives to the White worker. There is, of course, job reservation which is a great deal of protection in itself. Then there is also the White worker&#x2019;s own working capacity. The initiative he displays is also a protective characteristic in itself. But now there is something I want to know from the hon. member for Hillbrow and his party. That hon. member&#x2019;s party is fighting for the abolition of job reservation and for that sluices to be thrown open whether the workers concerned are skilled or unskilled and White or non-White. We surely know what the outcome of that would be. What would the position be when we have strikes? What is the hon. member&#x2019;s solution in the face of strikes? It will be a repetition of 1923. They will simply open up on the White workers with Maxims again and blood will again flow in the streets of the large cities. It will be 1923 all over again. That is the protection they gave to the White worker of South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself for a moment to that industrial giant in the Eastern Cape consisting of the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage and Despatch complex. I now find it so striking and regrettable that not one of my Opposition colleagues of Port Elizabeth is present at the moment. I can understand it if the hon. members for Newton Park and Walmer are not present, because they are more interested in agriculture. But I at least expected that touchy young member from Port Elizabeth Central to have been present this afternoon when we are engaged in such an important debate and are representing such a big industrial city. There is tremendous industrial expansion. Since the Physical Planning Act was put into effect, there have been more than 200 phases of development in Port Elizabeth in the past three years. Thirty-two new factories were also erected. This is great progress indeed. These factories today supply work to thousands of Whites. Coloureds and Bantu. For the sake of interest I want to furnish a few figures. There are at present 20 505 White men in that complex and 5 921 White women. This gives a total of 26 436 White workers in the factories. We hear so much about Coloureds who are unemployed. There are no fewer than 30 934 Coloured men employed. There are also 9 597 Coloured women employed. This gives a total of 40 413. There are 475 Asiatic men and 338 women, a total of 813. There are also 28 295 Bantu men and 3 269 women employed. This gives a total of 31 564. The total number of male and female workers in that factory is 90 209 and 19 017 respectively. It is also interesting this afternoon to know that mediation <span class="col_6951-6952" refersTo="page_0609"/>between the workers and the trade union organizations has eventually succeeded in establishing an industrial council for the assembly plants. We are grateful for this. An agreement was reached that will be published shortly. I trust that collective bargaining will succeed in eliminating differences about conditions of service.</p>

<p>In this connection I also just want to refer to the fact that at those factories we have large dining halls where Whites and non-Whites are served separately. All workers are given one hot meal per day. This is particularly the case at the assembly plants of the Ford Company, General Motors, Volkswagen and other factories in Port Elizabeth. Those meals are supplied at the minimal cost of about 10 cents per day.</p>

<p>The Opposition, particularly with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout as spokesman, said that we should do away with small apartheid. After the hon. the Prime Minister asked the hon. member for Bezuidenhout to define small apartheid, he said that small apartheid constituted discrimination on the grounds of skin colour. We should now like to know from the hon. Opposition whether they are going to follow the policy of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and do away with the separate dining halls at these factories? We are worried about this and we should like to have a reply. Does the Opposition now want Whites and non-Whites to have their warm meals in those dining halls without any separation? We should like to know from the Opposition whether they are going to do away with the separate cloakrooms and other separate facilities that we have established for our factory workers?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. POTGJETER</person>:</from>

<p>We should like to have that reply, because we are now in the difficult position of having an Opposition with three leaders. On the one hand we have the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, who tends towards the liberalistic side. Then we have the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who refuses to say to which side he wants to lead his party. Then we also have the hon. members for Port Natal, Hillbrow and Wynberg. These three members are engaged in a complete movement to the left. If I were to give them a name I would call them the &#x201C;koeksuster regiment&#x201D;. We now want those hon. members to stand up this afternoon and say whom we must now follow. Must we follow the hon. member for Hillbrow who is moving altogether to the left past the leader of the Progressive Party? Or must we follow the hon. member for Bezuidenhout? Or must we follow the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who does not want to say what his party&#x2019;s policy is?</p>

<p>As I have said, it is very regrettable that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central is not here this afternoon, because that hon. member has always succeeded in reading a speech in this House that has been written for him by someone else. I expected that hon. member to stand up here in the House this afternoon in order to tell us which of the three Opposition leaders he supports. When I think of this hon. member I involuntarily also think of the Biblical history of Jacob and Esau. When the hon. member speaks, one hears the voice of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central, but the hands are those of Esau; it is not his speech, it is a speech that has been written out for him by someone else.

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, comes from Port Elizabeth North. However, if one listens to his speech one has to ask oneself where he really comes from. One asks oneself how long he has been in South Africa. Does he really mean to tell us that he is not aware of certain conditions which have for many years existed in South Africa? He comes here and takes great pride in telling us about the economic integration which is taking place in the Port Elizabeth area. By the way, he does not believe in economic integration, but he comes here and boasts about it. He also tells us about the separate dining-rooms and he asks us whether we are going to abolish them when we come into power. Surely the hon. member is not a young man any more, and does he still not know after all these years that those separate dining-rooms were established in terms of legislation which the United Party had placed on the Statute Book? And what is more, it is the hon. member who comes here and talks about leaders. With followers like the hon. member no one can be a leader, because such a man cannot be led because he does not know enough to be led.</p>

<p>The hon. member comes here and says that this side of the House will again throw <span class="col_6953-6954" refersTo="page_0610"/>open the flood-gates when it comes into power. Of course, it is no use saying that the hon. member is talking so much nonsense, because he simply wants to accept that this side of the House is in favour of integration in South Africa. As a matter of fact, I do not mind their saying so, because the more they say it the more the people will know that the Nationalist Party makes propaganda by talking nonsense. The people will not accept it, and I am satisfied that that will be the case.</p>

<p>Then there is something which I find really a tragedy. hon. members on this side of the House, particularly the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Hillbrow, advanced forceful points as far as the labour policy and the labour position in South Africa are concerned. One statement after the other was indisputable and irrefutable, but the tragic thing is that we are still waiting for a reply. We are waiting for a reply from any hon. member or even, with all due respect, from the hon. the Minister. Not one of those hon. members has tried to furnish us with a reply, nor has the Minister.</p>

<p>What were the statements that were made? Basically the statements were to the effect that the labour question in South Africa cannot be viewed or discussed in isolation. It is part of the overall economic structure and whatever policy one pursues in South Africa, whether it is the policy of this side or of that side of the House, one will not have at one&#x2019;s disposal the material things to implement such policy unless one succeeds in keeping the economic machinery running at a high speed. This afternoon I sat thinking of the days when Churchill asked the American people for aid. He did not ask them to give him people: he did not ask them to buoy him up and he did not ask them to give him intelligence, because those things his country had. But he told them, &#x201C;Give us the tools and we shall do the job.&#x201D; The only thing the country of South Africa asks from this Government, no matter what policy it applies, is: &#x201C;Give us the tools and South Africa and its workers will do the job." That is all. But do not run away from the facts.</p>

<p>The second fact is that inter-dependence in the field of labour is increasing all the time. Moreover, it is being intensified by the day. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth North comes here and tells us in a boastful way about the economic integration which has taken place. It is taking place to an increasing extent throughout South Africa. Whites and non-Whites are promoting and developing the economic structure in South Africa. Another point, and this is a fact which is as plain as a pikestaff, is that South Africa is dealing with the most serious labour shortage ever. What does the hon. the Minister say? The hon. the Minister actually told us this afternoon that the situation is not as gloomy as all that. Let us now assume the hon. the Minister is correct. What did the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, his colleague, mean when he said, &#x201C;We require a super-human effort&#x201D;? He did not want an ordinary effort, but a &#x201C;super-human effort&#x201D;. If the situation is not gloomy, why should the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs go out of his way to hold out to us this picture as far was the labour shortage is concerned? The hon. the Minister says, however, we are laying it on too thick. He says there is practically no unemployment among the Whites, the Coloureds and the Indian workers. That we also know and we agree with him that the hon. the Minister is, after all, not only Minister of White, Coloured and Indian labour: surely he is the Minister of Labour for the whole of South Africa. Does he not know of the unemployment which does in fact, if I may express myself in this way, exist on a fair scale among the Bantu?</p>

<p>Yes, of Statistics. Surely he cannot be wrong. He says the figure is close on 100 000. However, there are people who put this figure even higher and say that there are almost one million people who are either not working or unproductive or not sufficiently productive. Is the hon. the Minister not aware of that figure? To me the situation certainly seems serious. If the hon. the Minister tells me that I am wrong, that he is aware of the situation and that he is providing training facilities, I want to ask again whether the <span class="col_6955-6956" refersTo="page_0611"/>hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is not aware of the training planning programme on which the hon. the Minister of Labour is working? Why then did he speak out of turn when he said: &#x201C;We require a super-human effort to train available manpower in South Africa?&#x201D; He was not talking about White people, Black people or Brown people. The hon. member for Yeoville asked the hon. the Minister to whom the Minister of Economic Affairs was referring, but the hon. the Minister said absolutely nothing about it. He did not say a word about that. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs was speaking in the light of the existing climate in South Africa, i.e. that the labour position is serious. The hon. the Minister did not give us the reply this afternoon when he spoke about his plans.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that it is his policy to protect the White workers, but he said absolutely nothing about the argument put forward by the hon. member for Yeoville, to the effect that the very thing the Government does not do is to protect the White worker. The hon. member for Yeoville said that the Government was putting obstacles in the way of the safety of the White workers through the very policy of decentralization. The hon. the Minister did not reply to this at all. The Minister asked what our policy was, and immediately said that we on this side of the House wanted to consult the workers&#x2019; unions. He then asked what we were going to do about TUCSA. TUCSA is not only liberal, but it is pink, and to be pink in South Africa is something terrible. The Minister asked how we were going to consult that pink organization. This afternoon I want to ask the Minister in all modesty and with all due respect whether he is prepared to tell South Africa that the organization of TUCSA, representing tens of thousands of White workers, is prepared to write off the White worker in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland, who has just resumed his seat, said that he has not had the replies to the questions put here this afternoon by the United Party, but he surely knows as well as I do that this is not true. He has surely had the replies to the questions put in respect of the policy of the National Party. But I am still waiting for replies to various questions I asked the hon. member for Maitland last time under a private motion, questions he has not yet replied to. All that he said is that the laws in connection with job reservation were introduced by the Smuts Government. But then he forgets that when the Industrial Conciliation Act was piloted through Parliament in 1954 and 1956, the United Party spoke of labour now being placed in a strait-jacket. Is that still their argument? An hon. member on that side of the House said, moreover, that section 77 of this Industrial Conciliation Act could be compared with chapter 12 of Hitler&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mein Kampf&#x201D;. That is what was said here, and they are still saying it today.</p>

<p>If there is one thing the White worker of South Africa is very insistent about, it is that his position should be protected and that we must guarantee him that position. Another thing the White workers of the Republic of South Africa are very interested in, is that there should be no such thing as unemployment. The Minister pointed out this afternoon that the kind of training the United Party desires would promote unemployment. Now I just want to read to you what happened in Britain according to <i>Hoofstad</i> of 10th May (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">About R16 million must be taken out of the taxpayer&#x2019;s pocket every week in order to support Britain's unemployed, who now number almost 800 000 and, according to pessimists, will reach the million mark by the end of the year.</block>

<p>That is what the United Party wants. But let me ask them the following question. Job reservation was introduced for the mines in 1926, and from that year onwards the Whites in the mines have been protected. In 1925, before we had introduced job reservation, there were 300 500 people <span class="col_6957-6958" refersTo="page_0612"/>employed in the mines, 10,5 per cent being Whites and 89,5 per cent being non-Whites. What is the position in 1970 under job reservation? In 1970 684 000 workers are employed by the mines, with 68 000 or 10 per cent being Whites, 609 000 or 89 per cent being Bantu and 7 000 or 0,1 per cent being Coloureds and Asiatics. I now ask this question: Are they going to abolish job reservation in the mines? It would create chaos.</p>

<p>This Vote we are discussing this afternoon is a very important one. It is said everywhere that education is the mother of all professions. Well, I say that labour is the mother of life itself. Labour is life itself. That is where man can fulfill himself. That is what he lives under. It is his whole life. That is why I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and his Department for this fine report which we received, in which we take note of the methods for combating the manpower shortage. In the biggest industries, such as the motor building, engineering, metal, explosives, sugar, electrical and coal industries, and in Government undertakings, the apprenticeship training period has been reduced from five years to four years. Moreover, exemption from the Apprenticeship Act has been granted so that persons of 19 years and older can be trained as bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters in the building industry for 18 months and subsequently qualify as artisans.</p>

<p>Sir, here I just want to mention, incidentally, that at Westlake the training per person costs R1 500 per year. In addition, exemption from the Apprenticeship Act is granted so that school pupils and students in the motor and metal industries can work in related industries during school holidays. Pupils in the motor industry can qualify as artisans after 2&#x00BD; years by doing trade tests. In 1970 a total of 10963 apprenticeship contracts were registered, i.e. 1 490 more than in the previous year. The building and motor industries were responsible for more than half of the increase.</p>

<p>One of the Department&#x2019;s most important objects is to promote the efficient utilization of the country&#x2019;s manpower source. Hence there is a specific division of the Department, i.e. the professional services division, which does this work with its academically and practically trained professional advisors in the fields of aptitude testing, vocational guidance, staff slection, rehabilitation of the retarded, surveys and analyses and the provision of employment. Large numbers of young people, i.e. particularly people under the age of 19, approach the Department every year for help with respect to their choice of a suitable career and with respect to obtaining work. They receive intensive vocational training with the aid of all kinds of psychological techniques. In 1970 a total of 25 800 vocational guidance interviews were conducted. Psychometric tests alone totalled 7 000, Even military camps are visited where vocational training is supplied. During the year more than 3 000 national servicemen were assisted in this way. As far as staff selection is concerned, more than 30 Government departments referred almost 2000 officers to the Department&#x2019;s offices for selection.</p>

<p>In the case of rehabilitation, a total of more than 16 000 interviews were conducted with physically and mentally retarded persons. Interviews were conducted with almost 1 400 ex-prisoners and 400 persons from asylums. As far as placement in the open labour market is concerned, 400 ex-prisoners, almost 1 900 retarded men, 330 women, 700 boys and 200 girls were selectively placed in employment. In addition more than 600 men, 90 women, 50 boys and 10 girls were placed in sheltered labour. Almost 1 900 professionally maladjusted persons Were given help and advice by vocational advisers. In the sphere of rehabilitation an inter-departmental committee exists, giving special attention to retarded persons. The Departments of Labour, Health, Prisons, Social Welfare and Pensions, National Education and education of the four provincial administrations and South-West Africa are represented here.</p>

<p>As far as the co-ordination of activities are concerned, the Department of Labour is represented by the professional services section consisting of the following, infer <i>alia:</i> the National Readjustment Committee and Vocational Board of the Department of National Education, the Special Schools Committee for Basic Curricula, also of the Department of National Education.

<p>Chairman, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, made one remark which certainly interested me. That was where he said that labour was the mother of all our activities. I thought that that was a very <span class="col_6959-6960" refersTo="page_0613"/>intelligent remark, something which is a little strange, coming from the hon. members opposite, because their speeches so far in this debate have been particularly lacking in intelligence In facing the problems that we have in South Africa.</p>

<p>What concerns me most is the hon. the Minister himself. The hon. the Minister is responsible for this very important portfolio, but he does not accept that there is a labour crisis in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister does not accept this fact, in spite of all the authorities, the authorities which support his side, the Government, and those who support our side. All the authorities in South Africa have been warning now for months on end about the mounting labour crisis; yet the hon. the Minister can calmly and coolly get up and brush them aside. He says it is not a problem at all. If it was not so serious one could say that time would rectify this problem; but the problem we have leaves us no time whatsoever. This is why I believe that what the Minister says, is in fact a very dangerous state in which we find ourselves today. The hon. the Minister ignores completely that the nation&#x2019;s strength is in its manpower. It is impossible that one-sixth of the population can go on carrying the burden of the other five-sixths. It just does not work; it never worked anywhere else and it certainly cannot work here. I would suggest that if we want to survive in South Africa, we must make use of all our manpower. It is no good the hon. the Minister and members opposite coming forward and saying that we are going to open the flood gates&#x2014;they know that this is absolute nonsense. I would suggest to those hon. members that it is about time they applied their minds to this problem, not as Nationalist politicians, but as South Africans. If they applied their minds to this problem as responsible South Africans, they would realize that it is no good getting up and making the same trite remarks year after year and which are getting us absolutely nowhere at all. The problem is that we have to make use of all our manpower. To make use of our manpower, we must train them. Unless we do so, I would suggest that we are heading for very dangerous waters indeed. If the problem means that we must educate our Whites to accept this change in pattern, we must do so, because the changing pattern is to the benefit of every White person in South Africa, as well as to those non-Whites whom we intend training. It is no good carrying on as we are and having debates like this year after year, with this side of the House warning the Government of the problems that lie ahead and the Government merely brushing them aside for political purposes. We are under-paying our non-Whites in South Africa because they are untrained. If we train them we could make better use of them. They could be better used by the community and we would be able to pay them more. I would like to suggest that the only reason why we will not train our non-Whites in South Africa, is because the Government fears the consequences. And I would suggest too that the greater threat to South Africa is in fact the untrained non-Whites. It is a greater threat than any we might face from the outside. The greatest threat to South Africa is the mass of untrained labour earning below economic wages. It is about time the Government faced these facts and told the White workers in South Africa that their policy is pegging down their own advancement, because if the Government would only change its policy, there is not a single White worker in South Africa who could not advance his standard of living. This is the problem and the crime that the Government is committing against the workers of South Africa. It holds in one hand the fear of the mass of non-White labour, and at the same time deprives us of that very White labour, the skills of that labour, which we need so much. It holds them back; it pegs their advancement to a minimum. Either the Government must yield its labour policies or it must yield the government, because it cannot do both in the interests of South Africa. Speaking entirely from a selfish point of view, what is the position in Africa today? We find an increase in the cost of living; harbours blocked; trains cancelled; homes not built because we have not the labour; a telephone crisis and services deteriorating in almost every sector of the economy. There is a breakdown of our standard of living. Then we hear comments, such as those that the hon. member for Brakpan made in this House when he got up and said that the White worker forms the majority of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s supporters.</p>

<p>He went on to say that the Nationalist Party would not be doing its duty if it allowed non-Whites to take over White jobs. I suggest that the Nationalist Party, for a change, should do its duty to South Africa. It owes more in its duty to South Africa than it owes to its White supporters.</p>

<p>In any case, under the latter course, the Nationalist Party is quite prepared to make concessions. It made particular concessions in areas such as Newcastle. The Nationalist Party calls us on this side of the House integrationalists and accuses us of wanting to open the floodgates, because we talk of breaking down job reservation. In Newcastle the Nationalist Party has allowed a construction firm, which gets many Government contracts to employ African bricklayers but it will not allow them to be employed anywhere else. They are only allowed to do so for this particular firm, which lives off Government contracts to a very large extent. This firm claims in its prospectus that it can build at a lower cost than any other firm. It can for the simple reason that it pays approximately 30c an hour to its Black bricklayers, which it is not supposed to have in the first place. How does this firm get away with it? It gets away with it because it gives to these Black bricklayers an instrument, which is not recognized in the building trade, namely a flat piece of iron with a handle attached. The firm claims that, since those workers are not using a trowel, they are not bricklayers. This cock-eyed thinking is costing South Africa dearly. If this cockeyed thinking is going to save the White race in South Africa, I suggest that the Nationalist Party erect a monument. At the top of this monument it can show this piece of flat iron, which is not supposed to be a trowel, because this piece of equipment is saving the White race from extinction. The Government are hypocrites in this particular respect.</p>

<p>I withdraw the word. Does this particular firm in Newcastle, Bester Homes, perhaps get away with it because it has undue influence or how does it get away with it? Is it happening in other areas as well? As I said just now, Government policy will forever condemn the White workers of South Africa to second-grade positions and a second-grade standard of living. The only way to save the White workers of South Africa from the self-inflicted wounds of the Nationalist Party is to train the non-Whites as speedily as possible, because only in this way will, not just the non-White workers but also the White workers and every one else in South Africa, be able to progress.

<p>I had thought the hon. member for Port Natal would swing this debate in a slightly different direction, but in reality the hon. member merely repeated what those who preceded him in this debate had said and what had already been said in three debates this session; a shortage of labour, training and wages. Those hon. members must tell us now whether they endorse every word said here this afternoon by the hon. member for Houghton. Do they endorse the plea for equal wages she made here this afternoon? They will have an opportunity to do so, because I think this debate will last another hour. They have the opportunity to tell us now to what extent they agree with the hon. member for Houghton. Sir, I am glad to see that the hon. member for Hillbrow is back in the Chamber. When the hon. member for Stilfontein referred to him a short while ago, it seemed as though he was disturbed and perhaps even slightly annoyed, if I may call it that, because the hon. member had told him that he should not act as if he were on television. I want to associate myself with the hon. the Minister and say to the hon. member for Hillbrow: The English Press is watching you in this debate. The English Press is not going to take notice of the way you swing your arms during your recital, or of your inflections or of your indications of tremendous concern. They are going to judge you on the substance of what you said. What I have just said applies to the hon. member for Yeoville as well and for as long as the substance of their speeches does not change, for so long they are going to be attacked by the people who have built them up and have brought them to here where they are today.</p>

<p>In regard to the Republic Day festivities and the public holiday now being granted to certain people, I should like to address a request to the hon. member for Houghton. I am doing this because I do not think there are hon. members on the other side who will respond to this. I want to ask <span class="col_6963-6964" refersTo="page_0615"/>her to appeal to those people who want to boycott Republic Day, to go to work on that day so that there would be no need for them to sit around at home. In that way they would at least be able to make use of that public holiday. If the hon. member wanted to do that, she would be doing the country a favour.</p>

<p>I now come to another point. I should like to thank the hon. the Minister for the way in which he handled the bus dispute in the Johannesburg urban areas. Sir, you will remember that the Municipality of Johannesburg kicked up a tremendous fuss last year about the shortage of bus staff. According to the United Party City Council, and those people opposite, there was only one solution and that was to use Coloured drivers. What they wanted to do there reflects the very thing they want to do in respect of every facet of our labour pattern in order to prove that separate development is not succeeding. What they wanted to do was to bring to bear tremendous pressure so that the demands would eventually have to be met for Coloureds to be employed on White buses. At that stage the hon. the Minister used the machinery available to him. He asked the industrial tribunal to take action in this matter, and what did we find? That fuss blew over. I understand that while that fuss was being made, as many as 3 600 buses per month were cancelled, while at present fewer than 500 buses per month are cancelled. The possibility no longer exists that the available male and female staff of those buses will resign from the service, which would have necessitated the employment of Coloureds. The matter was solved in co-operation with the trade unions. Savings were effected and planning was undertaken in various ways, and friction which could have arisen, was eliminated. Racial friction could have arisen between official and passenger or between official and co-official on those buses, but that difficulty was eliminated by the action of the hon. the Minister and the industrial tribunal.</p>

<speech by="#mciachlan">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. MCIACHLAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, many people still have to wait in the streets. I saw them again in the past week, but the hon. member for Houghton should turn to the people sitting next to her. There was one complaint before the hon. the Minister and that was that there was a shortage of certain staff. Through his intervention by means of the industrial tribunal that problem was solved. There are hundreds of other matters which that United Party municipality can rectify in order to improve the bus situation in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Earlier on when he was making his speech the hon. member for Yeoville kicked up a tremendous fuss. He pointed out, <i>inter alia</i>, the tremendous demands which were going to be made by the workers. He said that sooner or later this Government would not be able to resist the pressure any longer and that at such time large-scale salary concessions would have to be made again. In this regard I should like to quote from the report of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council of February, 1971. The report reads as follows (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be pointed out that the wage increases which took place in general in certain branches of the private sector, may be ascribed for more than two- thirds to the offers from the side of industrial employers in an attempt to retain their employees or to obtain more employees &#x2026; and only approximately for one-third to wage agreements negotiated by the trade unions and in which the autonomous cost-pressure factor could therefore have played an important role.</block>

<p>Then this important statement follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this regard the council noted with appreciation the responsible way in which organized labour had conducted these wage negotiations.</block>

<p>Here we have a group of authoritative people telling us in anticipation that the hon. member for Yeoville is mistaken. No unreasonable, unfair pressure will be brought to bear. As in the case of this single example of the Johannesburg bus staff, so the trade unions not being led by Tom Murrays and others, will act responsibly because they are as afraid as we on this side are of the possibility of unemployment, of the possibility of racial conflict and racial friction in the sphere of labour.</p>

<p>There is much talk in this House of labour in various spheres. But in no debate have hon. members on that side of this House satisfied me with regard to the question <span class="col_6965-6966" refersTo="page_0616"/>of labour, because when they speak of labour, they head only for the economy. The first instruction to file first human being was to work. The instruction was: In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread- For that reason labour is an inherent part of man&#x2019;s existence. For that reason every person wants to and shall work. The National Party recognizes that principle, i.e. that the people do not work only for the economy, but that they also have a need for it as well. Man does not work only for food, clothes and accommodation. These things are of basic importance, but man also works to serve the community in which he lives. The South African community is a particularly complex one. We have racial problems. We must continually warn against the possibilities of racial conflict. Our workers realize it is our great task and their great task to approach labour in such a way that each will do only his best on his own level and receive his wage for that.</p>

<p>But are hon. members opposite prepared to tell us where they want to draw the line in respect of the plea made by the hon. member for Houghton, i.e. that there should be equal wages for everybody? Should it be applicable only to the bricklayer, or in the highest circles of technical and administrative workers as well? [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#baxter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. D. BAXTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask the hon. member for Westdene who has just sat down, whether he has ever walked along a bus queue in Johannesburg trying to find out what the people, who are standing there waiting for the buses to come, think about the bus service in Johannesburg. All they are concerned about is getting to and from their work. They do not care a tinker&#x2019;s damn whether the bus is going to be driven by a White busdriver or a non-White busdriver.</p>

<p>In the remarks I wish to address this House, I would like to direct hon. members attention to the position of the Coloured workers in the Western Cape and particularly the position of the Coloured workers in greater Cape Town, Although the statistics available in regard to the details of Coloured workers and their position in industry in the Western Cape, are not up to date as the 1970 statistics are not yet available to us, there is no doubt that this area has to rely more and more on Coloured labour for its semi-skilled work requirements. It has to rely more and more on Coloured workers even for its skilled labour requirements. Important industries such as the clothing industry, which is the largest industry in this area, and the footwear industry are already virtually entirely manned by Coloured workers. Other important industries, such as the construction industry, the building industry and the ancillary trades connected with the building industry, are increasingly leaning on the Coloured people for their skilled and semi-skilled labour requirements. What is significant about the position in the Western Cape is that although the advance of the Coloured people into skilled and semi-skilled work has taken place very definitely and very clearly, it has also happened gradually by way of evolution and, most important of all, it has happened peacefully.</p>

<p>The industrial history of this area has, to my mind, tended to prove three things. Firstly, it has proved that the Coloured people are increasingly providing the backbone of the blue collar work force. In some industries they provide the complete work force. Secondly, it is proved that this evolution of the Coloureds coming into industry and providing the skilled and semiskilled work force has not been to the disadvantage of the White workers who previously were in those industries. It has not been to the White workers&#x2019; disadvantage, because they have moved into more skilled jobs and have moved into more responsible jobs and they have moved into the white collar jobs. Thirdly, history has tended to prove that the intermediate period, when both White and Coloured workers were working in the same industries doing the same jobs and very often working there side by side, has been a peaceful intermediate period. Let me say that this evolution has been peaceful not because of the Government and its policies, but rather despite the Government and its policies. It has been peaceful because of the good sense and the responsibility of the workers, the trade unions and the employers.</p>

<p>This evolution of the Coloureds advancing and being integrated in the economic activity of the area is as inevitable as night following day. The Coloureds have the innate ability to do these jobs and with the relatively faster increase in their population, it is natural that they should provide the dominant numbers of workers. This process is not stopping with blue collar <span class="col_6967-6968" refersTo="page_0617"/>workers. It is already happening and it is happening to an increasing degree that Coloured workers are entering the white collar grades in commerce, finance, banking and the distributive trade.</p>

<p>This is something which should be recognized by the Government as being inevitable and the hon. the Minister should stop playing King Canute and trying to push this tide back. What is required is recognition of the fact that this development is taking place, recognition that it is desirable and recognition that it should be encouraged because it is to the benefit of everyone, the Coloured workers and the White workers alike. Instead of using measures such as the Shops and Offices Act to put obstacles in the way of this evolution happening, the Government should be preparing the ground so that this advance of the Coloured people into more responsible white collar jobs takes place smoothly and peacefully.</p>

<p>One of the chief worries of the White workers as the result of Coloureds coming into areas which have been traditionally White areas of work is that their wages will be undermined. This is far more important in their minds than the need for physical separation between Whites and non-White workers on which the hon. the Minister places so much emphasis. I think that this is a very real and justified fear. I think it is regrettable and shortsighted that the wages of the Coloureds, although they comply with the minimum requirements of wage determinations and industrial conciliation agreements, are generally being set lower than the wages and salaries of their White counterparts doing the same work. It is regrettable, because it induces a sense of insecurity among the White workers. It is regrettable because it encourages bitterness among the Coloured workers, and it is regrettable because there is no basis of equity or morality in paying less for equal work just because the Coloured labour is more freely available. I think it is regrettable that this is being done by so many employers in this area, including, I might say, employers who are known to be members of the Progressive Party. Nothing could be more calculated to lead to friction than this practice, and it is for that very reason that it is a cornerstone of the policy of this side of the House that the rate should be paid for the job. I would like to appeal to employers to observe this principle voluntarily, because it is in their long-term interests to do so. While the hon. the Minister may have no legal powers to enforce equal pay for equal work, I do regard it as his duty, in the interests of the prosperity of the country and its progress, and in the interest of industrial peace, to set a lead by using his considerable influence to encourage the practice of paying equal wages for equal work to Coloureds in white-collar jobs in this part of the country.</p>

<p>We have now finally heard from the hon. member for Constantia that what the United Party wants' is &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;. I hope the Afrikaans worker, the White worker in South Africa, will take note that this is the new policy of the Opposition. Sir, the debate up to now has shown us very clearly that there are two approaches to labour matters in South Africa, namely the approach of this side of this House and the approach of that side of this House. The approach of this side is very clear. We want industrial peace and, above all, satisfaction in the sphere of labour, but does the Opposition pay any attention to this? No, they are only interested in one matter, and one matter alone, i.e. to make as much money as possible, and in order to do this, they are prepared to open the flood-gates so that the Blacks may swamp South Africa. This is what they did when they were in power, and if they were to have the opportunity again, Heaven preserve White South Africa!</p>

<p>Sir, this is the fifth session I have attended here, and never have I heard an hon. member on that side of the House rise and say, &#x201C;I am proud that the United Party did this and that for South Africa while it was in power&#x201D;. I have not heard one example of that.</p>

Sir, I can lay quite a number of things at their door; I can mention several reasons <span class="col_6969-6970" refersTo="page_0618"/>why the White voters of South Africa decided that they were sick and tired of the United Party. In fact, there are so many examples that one does not know where to start. But since we are concerned with a labour debate now, why not start by laying at their door a charge concerning labour? Can hon. members opposite tell me how they acted under their labour arrangements when labour problems arose in 1913, in 1914 and 1922?</p>

<p>I can read it out to members from Hansard and also from Crafford&#x2019;s book on Gen. Smuts. And I have seen it with my own eyes. If the hon. member had been in Pretoria during the war years, he would have known what I am talking about. However, I want to raise two other matters with the hon. the Minister. Much has been said here today about the labour shortage. I should like to make a request to the hon. the Minister. If the question is too delicate, I shall leave it at that. There are two sources of labour which may perhaps be investigated by the department and which may perhaps bear fruit. The first group is one of which the hon. member for Hillbrow should be aware. I am referring to that group of our South African youth that may usually be recognized by their long hair, clothing, etc. Perhaps the hon. member for Hillbrow could furnish us with more information in this regard. The other group I have in mind, are the Whites who are in gaols. These people could be used at places where they would not be in the public eve, because they would still be serving sentences. Other departments are concerned in this matter as well, but one could consider this possibility. The services of these people could possibly be used in a very constructive way in order to relieve the labour shortage to a certain extent.</p>

<p>The second matter I want to mention, is really more concerned with Pretoria West. This matter was reported to the Department of Labour, and I want to thank the hon. the Minister and his department for the diligent and capable way in which they paid attention to the matter and also for the very courteous letter they wrote to me, I should like to read out part of the letter. It read as follows (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to your complaints about the mixed working conditions at Michau Outfitters, Danville, Pretoria, I must inform you that after negotiations with Mr. Michau, my department succeeded in bringing about separation between the White women and Indians in that a partition was erected in the shop.</block>

<p>Is that separate development?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#pieterse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. J. J. PIETERSE</person>:</from>

<p>If that hon. member wants to go and work in the place of an Indian, I shall ask the hon. the Minister to give permission, for that. The letter went on to say:</p>

<block name="quote">This means that the business premises now consist of two sections, each with its own separate entrance, and that the Indians work in the one section and the Whites in the other. At present the shop has also been adapted in such a way that the White woman, who is the cashier as well as the supervisor, can receive the money through the partition. This means that the Indians no longer have to leave their section in order to hand in payments to the cashier. The department is not in a position to force the employer by law to replace the Indians with Whites.</block>

<p>I should like to discuss another matter with the hon. the Minister as well. Pretoria has now its own Indian residential area which has been very effectively laid out by the City Council of Pretoria. The Indians have their own business area, and I want to ask the Minister whether it is not possible to move the Indians living in the White area so that they may go and work in that Indian business area. If that could be done, I would appreciate it very much. Perhaps the hon. the Minister and his department could investigate the matter and do something about it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. PYPER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I found difficulty in following the logic of the hon. member for Pretoria West towards the end of his speech. Apparently he has a problem in connection with shop apartheid, but I think that he should rather write a letter to the hon. the Minister in this connection, because I could not follow his logic very well. The hon. member wanted to know from us what the United Party had done for the workers. The Industrial Reconciliation Act, which is spoken of with so much pride by hon. members opposite and which ensures industrial peace and quiet in South Africa, is something that the old South African Party established. It is the foundation on which the labour structure in South Africa was developed. This evening I just want to make one remark, Several times I have heard in this hon.</p>

<p>House how the United Party is referred to as supposedly being political vultures. I have heard it said in debates by both the Prime Minister and other members, for example the hon. member for Randburg. But when we are speaking about labour&#x2014;I have gathered this&#x2014;about the shortage that exists and the possible solutions to the problem of the labour shortage in this country, I am convinced that the actions of hon. members opposite are exactly those of political vultures.</p>

<p>One can divide them into two groups. There are those to whom I refer as the totally reckless. That is the type who hopes that when we speak we will say something which they can interpret as the hon. member has just done, i.e. as if we want to throw wide the sluices and the doors for unskilled non-White labour. We have heard this repeatedly. I believe that people who speak in this way do not care one little bit for the future of South Africa. These are people who do not actually want the labour problem to be solved, because they see that for as long as our country has a labour question it is something from which political capital can be made. While we, in our policy statements, speak of negotiations with trade union and staff organizations, they continue to speak as they do. They are fully aware of that. The hon. member, who has just resumed his seat, even spoke of &#x201C;streams that flow&#x201D;, and not only of sluices. He must surely be aware of that.</p>

<p>But there is also another type of hon. member opposite. He at least realizes that something must be done about the labour problem. He is the one who has thus far tried to run away, but nevertheless cannot scrape together the courage to indicate to the people what road must be followed.</p>

<p>Ah, sit down. It is hon. members who, by means of the question and answer technique, want to get certain suggestions from us. When we give these suggestions, they pounce on them like predators and try to get hold of them. In some cases they make a total botch-up of it.</p>

<p>Sir, I am going to give you specific examples. I hope that I shall still have enough time this evening. I have last year&#x2019;s Hansard here. Unfortunately I shall not have time to go through it. In the debate about mining the Nationalist Party applied the<span class="col_6973-6974" refersTo="page_0620"/>question and answer tactics to the hon. members for Rosettenville and Yeoville with respect to the training of non-Whites in the Bantu reserves. When the reply was given to the question about what they must be trained for, it sounded like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Must he be taught to be a miner? &#x2014;<br/>Yes, he must be taught to be a miner.</block>

<p>To another question that was asked, the hon. member for Rosettenville replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, if the unions say that this is what will have to be done.</block>

<p>Sir, it is very interesting that, within a few weeks of that happening, the brave heroes, the hon. members for Rustenburg and Stilfontein, for example, held meetings and tried to open negotiations. What was interesting is that they tried to do if according to the guidelines laid down by the United Party. But we can go further. Here I have, for example, an instance in the Railway debate. The Minister of Transport put questions to the hon. member for Durban Point in that connection, referring to the problems they have in the Durban harbour. The member for Durban Point then said that he was referring to the job of fork-lift truck driver. That was on 15th March, 1971. Two weeks later there was a big announcement in the newspaper, &#x201C;Move to beat backlog&#x2014;Africans to do White wharf jobs&#x201D;. If one reads this one finds that suddenly 55 have been employed.</p>
