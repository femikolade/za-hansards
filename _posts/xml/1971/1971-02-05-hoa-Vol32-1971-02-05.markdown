<p>I should just like to give hon. members an indication of the work of the House in the immediate future. Next week we will consider those bills which appear on the Order Paper at present.</p>

<p>As regards the rest of the session, I should like to give hon. members some information. I understand that this information has been broadcast over the 1 p.m. news. I should like to give the assurance, however, that I did not give the S.A.B.C. that information; so how they got hold of it, I do not know. In any event, the position is that the Part Appropriation Bill will be introduced on the 10th February and the debate thereon will start on Monday, 15th February. The Railway Budget will be introduced on the 10th March and the debate thereon will start on the 15th March. The Post Office Budget will be introduced on the 23rd March and the debate thereon will start on the 24th. On the 31st March the main Budget will be introduced by the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of April 2nd the House will adjourn for the Easter recess and will resume on the 13th April. The Budget Debate will start on that day.</p>

<p>In regard to the Republican Festival, the House will not adjourn, except on the 31st May, as is provided for in the Standing Orders.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned yesterday afternoon I was dealing with the inability of the public to make head or tail of the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s labour policy. On that occasion I referred to the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x2019;s speech here in this debate, and to a speech which he made before the Nationalist Party Congress in East London. According to the two speeches he made, the policy which he announced here and the interpretation he gave in East London are poles apart. In that connection I want to repeat my appeal of yesterday, i.e. that the hon. the Prime Minister, who is the head of the Government, should clear up the confusion for us in connection with the labour situation. The United Party desires that our labour policy in South Africa be applied more flexibly. It is not only the labour policy which lays down the basis of our sustained growth, other factors are also involved. There is surely nothing bad in putting the prosperity of one&#x2019;s country first. In this debate hon. members on that side of the House held it against the United Party for being in favour of greater growth and prosperity in South Africa. They say we want to place everything on the altar of prosperity, but we believe that placing the welfare of one&#x2019;s country first is one of the highest forms of patriotism. <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0192"/>To plead for the prosperity of all the citizens of the country is also the highest form of realism in a multi-racial country such as South Africa.</p>

<p>To prevent large population areas from making full use of their labour potential is going to complicate our race relations in South Africa, and it is going to hamper our growth as well. Did South Africa not get the advice of an Anton Rupert when he told us a few years ago: &#x201C;If these people do not eat, we do not sleep&#x201D;&#x003F; At this stage South Africa is not calling for greater economic separation; on the contrary, the country is begging for a Government which will be prepared to apply economic integration efficiently in such a way that there will be balanced development throughout the country and in such a way that on that basis we shall fit in our race policy. Everyone knows the reason why the Government&#x2019;s policy has thus far failed. It is because economic realities are pushing the country in another direction. We on this side of the House understand the dilemma which the hon. the Prime Minister and the Government are in. We understand that promises were made that cannot be carried out, and we know that there were promises of greater separation. We also realize the pressure being exerted, from certain quarters in their Party, for greater separation. But the South African electorate also realizes this helplessness, and they are aware of the paralysis that has set in the Nationalist Party as a result of this pressure. It is, however, the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s task, and that of the Government, to shake itself free of this feeling of helplessness, and it is his task to make the necessary adjustments if we want adequate growth in this country.</p>

<p>&#x2020;Before the last session and after the setbacks which were suffered by the Nationalist Party Government in the April election, all the newspapers suggested that the Prime Minister was going to hold the reins very tightly. They even suggested in bold headlines that all eyes were focussed on the Prime Minister. They said, and I quote:</p>

<p>Alle o&#x00EB; is op die Eerste Minister gerig.</p>

<p>He did not use this opportunity in the last session with the result that his newspapers today are disappointed. None of those high hopes as had been expressed before the last session were expressed after the Provincial election. None of these hopes were evident in their newspapers before the present session. Perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister will use this opportunity and surprise them and also surprise us and at the same time set the country on a realistic course. South Africa today wants policies and less meaningless propaganda. In this debate we have had an abundance of propaganda from that side. Do they not realize that the Black danger or the so-called Black danger does not frighten large sections of our people any more&#x003F;</p>

<p>*I want to refer the hon. gentlemen to what their own newspapers said before the last election. In April they were still saying that they were not going to lose, but that they were going to win additional seats. This did not happen. Before the October election they said that they were going to win additional seats. Even Mr. Steyl, their Transvaal Provincial Secretary, said that the Nationalist Party was going to improve its position in the Transvaal. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that the National Party is going to improve its position in the Transvaal Provincial Council. The Party has a good chance of winning new constituencies and capturing existing U.P. seats.</block>

<p>Then <i>Dagbreek</i> said the same and the following headlines appeared in the newspaper: &#x201C;National Party can win up to seven seats&#x201D; and &#x201C;National Party is sharpening its teeth for Provincial winnings.&#x201D; All these hopes were expressed before the recent election. What do we now find after the election&#x003F; What does their Press now say about the Nationalist Party&#x003F; Why did they lose seats&#x003F; &#x201C;It is stalwart Nat. leaders who are underestimating the voters&#x201D;, says the <i>Beeld,</i> of 1st November, 1970. It was not simply any man they picked up in the street to talk to. No, they talked to the Secretary of the Aasvo&#x00EB;lkop branch of the Nationalist Party in Florida. This is what she says (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With its official policy the National Party can do much better than it did in the election on Wednesday. Its difficulty lies with its stalwart Nationalists in fairly senior positions who underestimate the voters and who also just want to stick to the old methods.</block>

<p>These are the observations of their own people after the recent election. Now <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0193"/>listen to how this lady, Mrs. Rautenbach, concludes her view of things. The report continues as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">What are the complaints they encountered among the people in the constituency&#x003F; She says that many complain about the &#x201C;pettiness&#x201D; of the N.P.: Job reservation, shortage of labour, general antipathy among the people, and quite a few also said candidly that they were no longer voting N.P. as long as Dr. Carel de Wet was there.</block>

<p>While these stories are being written about the Nationalist Party, the hon. the Minister of Health is continuing with his dance.</p>

<p>What were the experiences of Nationalist Party candidates, not only in the case of Florida, but also in many other cases where Nationalist Party candidates lost&#x003F; What does Mr. Malan say, who lost the election in Westdene&#x003F; He says: &#x201C;One of the characteristics of the election is that the United Party evidences more vitality in respect of workers than the National Party.&#x201D; In addition he says:</p>

<block name="quote">There is no stimulus for the younger generation. The less well-to-do people are not participating either because those they look up to for leadership in many cases regard it beneath their dignity to engage actively in the National Party organization.</block>

<p>He says the less well-to-do people are no longer participating and helping the Nationalist Party. In just the previous paragraph he also says that even the well-to-do people are no longer interested in helping the Nationalist Party. Is the fact that these things are taking place not a danger sign to the hon. the Prime Minister&#x003F; I want to refer him to what Mr. Schalk Pienaar said in the <i>Beeld</i> of 8th November, 1970. He said (translation):</p>

<block name="quote">This sort of thing is symbolic of what the National Party threw off with the expulsion of the Hertzog people, but it took too long. The Party&#x2019;s image has been damaged, and in practice we are still saddled too much with that kind of thing. The Afrikaner youth, broadly speaking, looks at us and sees an old man&#x2019;s home where life is lived in the past and where thought and speech are in an extinct idiom.</block>

<p>This is the problem we have in South Africa because the Nationalist Party does not read the signs outside. Because they do not realize what the people of South Africa want, a man such as Prof. Harry Lever had to declare that the Afrikaner youth is inclining to the United Party.</p>

<p>&#x2020;We therefore have to get the answers from the hon. the Prime Minister. Our survival in South Africa now depends on an enlightened approach. We want moderation instead of extremism. No one can deny that there is a spirit of pessimism abroad amongst the entrepreneurs of this country today, those who have the tremendous task of keeping our growth going. If the hon. the Prime Minister is considering adjustments to his policies, he must spell them out clearly for this House and South Africa to understand. Confusion should make way for clarity and for new hope and optimism in South Africa. To be poor is no shame, but to be wealthy and prosperous is no crime either. When you are wealthy and prosperous so many problems are relegated into the background and our aim in South Africa should be to uplift all our people and not the selected or lucky few in this country.</p>

<p>A lot has also been said about the young people and a lot of negative advice was thrown in their direction. But what do we find from the Government&#x003F; They admonish the youth instead of encouraging them with sound leadership. Why should they not give this message to the youth, and not only to the youth but to all the people of South Africa, namely &#x201C;work hard, but seize your opportunities and then enjoy the fruits of your labours through a higher standard of living&#x201D;. But the Government encourage the young people to be pessimistic. They are placing obstacles in their way to making full use of their vitality which could be applied to the benefit of South Africa as a whole.</p>

<p>*That is the situation in connection with inflation. The young people know that today there are many opportunities for them, but what do these large salaries mean that they are earning today&#x003F; This Government has now come back after six years and told us that we shall have to take even bigger steps to combat inflation in South Africa. After six years, in which time the Government should have displayed to us the efficacy of its measures, it can only come back now and say that it <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0194"/>will have to take even more stringent steps to combat inflation in South Africa. It is also necessary for us to understand how this Government created its inflation. Shortly after the Sharpeville and Langa incidents it was necessary for us to stimulate our economy in this country. Confidence amongst the people was very low at that stage. During that period the Government did announce big schemes which were to recapture people&#x2019;s confidence locally and abroad. Those steps were aimed at enticing new capital to South Africa. And this was not done without success. But even at an early stage the hon. the Leader of the Opposition warned the Government that if we wanted a sustained economic growth we would be hard pressed by one single factor, i.e. the shortage of trained manpower, particularly technical staff. The Government also realized this and therefore amended its short-sighted immigration policy to the benefit of South Africa. But no notice was ever taken of our warnings that we need a crash programme to educate members of all the race groups in South Africa. What was the order of the day&#x003F; &#x201C;Spend for prosperity.&#x201D; This proposal came from the Government.</p>

<p>But in the middle &#x2019;sixties another warning came. &#x201C;The economy is becoming over-heated. We are developing too fast and our manpower is becoming inadequate.&#x201D; Interest rates then had to be increased in order to reduce consumption and investment. It was the Government&#x2019;s policy to take money out of circulation. At this specific time, when the manpower shortage is too great and is getting progressively worse, legislation is still placed on the Statute Books to exercise stricter control over unskilled labour coming to the White developing areas. How can the Government deny that it was its ideological policy that gave rise to this situation, and that it is their policy that aggravated it. Then they took steps to impede and obstruct the flow to our cities.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The fight against inflation started just over six years ago. Then it was tackled in all seriousness, but after six years this Government has to come to Parliament and to say that they have had no success whatsoever in deflating our economy. The signs of their failure are everywhere for every South African to observe. A steady increase in interest rates, which was originally seized on to curb excessive spending, is still with us. But now the high interest rates signify something completely different. Now it stays high, because capital investment is scarce. This is a strange paradox into which this Government has brought South Africa. They raise the interest rate to make money less available, and now it stays at a high level, because it is not available. Therefore, we are fully justified when we in the United Party suggest that this Government has failed to curb inflation. Surely, by now one would have expected a levelling off of prices. Food prices by now should have remained stable. But that does not happen. In fact, only recently the Government gave their enthusiastic approval to the rise in the price of bread. When they had the opportunity to stop the rise, the Government chose to do absolutely nothing from their side. They preferred to do nothing but to watch the situation.</p>

<p>*What was the attitude of the hon. the Minister of Agriculture, who is responsible for the fact that there was an increase in the price of bread, towards this matter when there were certain of our chain stores in South Africa that were prepared to sell bread at less than the maximum price&#x003F; What was his attitude towards them&#x003F; His attitude was that it would create a tremendous amount of complications for us if they were to do so. But the hon. the Minister forgets that there are thousands upon thousands of people in the country, White as well as non-White, who appreciated the fact that they were nevertheless in a position to purchase bread at a reduced price.</p>

<p>Did the hon. the Minister say anything when the Wheat Board said that it would take certain steps in that connection&#x003F; Some officials of the Wheat Board said they were going to take steps against some of the retailers selling bread below the maximum price. Then there were other officials who said that they were not going to take action. I must say, in gratitude to the hon. the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, that he definitely created the impression that they were not going to act. But, Sir, why must people be threatened with legal steps if they are prepared to keep the cost of living in South Africa at a low level&#x003F; This increased price of bread and the increased subsidy are not there for the benefit of the farmer; the farmer only gets about R700,000 out of it&#x2014; that is what the hon. the Minister himself <span class="col_363-364" refersTo="page_0195"/>said&#x2014;but the baker and the miller are the ones who reap the benefits. When the chain stores took this step in keeping the price at a low level, one would have expected&#x2014;the people of South Africa did expect it&#x2014;that the Government would, in the first place, rather have increased the subsidy on bread.

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this motion of no confidence introduced by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is the sixteenth, if I have counted correctly, which he has introduced in this House. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will make history; in his parliamentary lifetime he will introduce more motions of no confidence than anyone before him or anyone after him.</p>

<p>Sir, every motion of no confidence inevitably has its own characteristics, its own atmosphere, and the same definitely applied to this motion. The debate that followed on the motion has been an interesting one, seen from the point of view of what was said; in places it has been even more interesting when seen from the point of view of what was not said. We have had a week&#x2019;s debate. With the exception of two persons, the entire front bench of the Opposition participated in this debate. It strikes one that the hon. member for Umbilo, who usually discusses pensions and has a kind heart for these people, did not participate in the debate. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that this was no ordinary motion of no confidence; it was far more than that; it was the authoritative judgment, the authoritative standpoint and opinion of a party which is on the point of taking over the reins of government. It was therefore no ordinary motion of no confidence, Mr. Speaker, and for that reason it was interesting for me as a Parliamentarian to see that the hon. member for Umbilo did not participate in the debate. I also found it very interesting, in view of the fact that this debate was largely and primarily concerned with labour, labour in all sectors of our national life, that the hon. member for South Coast, who is an authority on certain aspects of labour, did not participate in the debate. But, Sir, this is something I merely noted in passing.</p>

<p>What impressed me a great deal, however, is that with the exception of the hon. member for Gardens, who referred to the matter merely in passing, and with the exception of the hon. member for Albany, who referred to it only briefly in passing as if it were of minor importance, there was not a single word from the opposite side throughout this entire debate about farming matters and the problems of the farmers. I find this interesting, and one must look for the cause, for this was after all no ordinary motion of confidence in which one little matter is singled out; this was after all the great motion of no confidence which was to have been moved. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say a word in that connection either. One does not say anything about pensioners and farmers, because there is no election in the offing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on this occasion I want to say a few words about one group of farmers, but before doing so I want to say that all of us in this House, regardless of which party we belong to, are exceptionally pleased at and that our hearts are filled with profound gratitude for the rains we have had over large parts of South Africa and, according to reports, are still having, and hope we will continue to have. There is profound gratitude and great rejoicing in one&#x2019;s heart at the great measure of relief this has brought to many farmers who were sorely burdened as a result of the drought. One hopes and prays that that situation will continue.</p>

<p>There is one group of farmers in South Africa who are suffering greater hardships than any of the others, and this is the wool farmers of South Africa, partly as a result of the drought and partly as a result of a decline on the world market as far as their product is concerned. One is grateful for the fact that the wool-producing countries have recently made much greater attempts to achieve co-operation than they have ever done in the past. One is very grateful for the fact that even greater co-operation is in sight. The wool farmers of South Africa are independent people who are proud of their independence. They are not people who are forever asking the State for assistance. They have shown in the past of what stuff they are made. Since one of the problems in the past has been that there was no unanimous action among the woolproducing countries, it is with gratification that we have taken cognizance of the latest steps taken by Australia in that connection to proceed to the establishment of a buying organization.</p>

<p>One would like to give that organization a chance to prove itself, but I want to say in passing that if it should become necessary <span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0196"/>for South Africa to hold talks with other wool-producing countries in order to stabilize this industry, South Africa would be very keen to participate in such talks. One hopes&#x2014;and, as a matter of fact, personal discussions which I have had in this connection indicated that the wool farmers to whom this task has been entrusted both at home and abroad are optimistic&#x2014;that these new schemes will have the desired effect. While the Government has in the past, not only in respect of wool farmers, but in respect of all farmers in times of need, gone far out of its way to grant assistance by way of subsidies and by way of various schemes, including the withdrawal schemes, I want to say that if it should appear that the wool farmers have by means of their organizations, national and international, done everything in their power, if it should appear that the schemes have had sufficient time to prove themselves and have not had the desired results, the Government will very seriously consider finding other ways and means of coming to their assistance.</p>

<p>The theme throughout this motion of no confidence was the increase there has been in prices, an increase in prices which is a world-wide phenomenon, and all of us know that it has occurred in South Africa as well. No matter how one deplores it, one knows that it is largely inevitable. But what good will it do merely to speak about the increase in prices&#x003F; Surely one must compare it with something; one must project it against some background. Simply to say that prices have increased, means nothing; one must contrast this with something. One must look at the reverse side of the coin, that is to say, the increased incomes and the increased salaries and wages which went hand in hand with that. After all, what would one gain by presenting a distorted and one-sided picture of the matter without contrasting the two&#x003F; My colleagues here did so very effectively. But what I found interesting in this connection was that while no comparison was made by hon. members on the opposite side, while they did not deem it worth while to do so or omitted to say that there had been corresponding increases, there was one hon. member on the opposite side who did refer to salary increases, and that is the hon. member for Hillbrow. Sir, I cast my mind back and I remembered how we were attacked before the elections and during the elections, on the one hand because there had not been any increase, and then on the other because the increases were not sufficient. Those were the complaints and the accusations which were continually being made against this side of the House. But now that the election is a thing of the past, the hon. member for Hillbrow referred to those increases which were granted and called them &#x201C;unprecedented&#x201D; increases. In other words, they were much too large and the Government was irresponsible in having granted those excessive increases. I find this particularly illuminating.</p>

<p>But I also listened to what was said by the hon. member for Hillbrow, and I am quoting his words, when he referred to the standpoints not only of members on this side of the House, but of every individual who had the interests of South Africa and its future at heart. He referred to their exhortations in the following words: &#x201C;Senseless and puerile exhortations to the effect that we must work harder and save more.&#x201D; Sir, I can hardly imagine anything more irresponsible than that that a deputy leader of a party can say a thing like that in the Parliament of South Africa. But it was not a keynote which I noticed only in the case of that hon. member; I also noticed it in the case of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and I noticed it in the case of various other members on the opposite side of the House. I was astonished.</p>

<p>If a man gets up in this House and says: &#x201C;Look, you must not impose savings levies on people who cannot afford them,&#x201D; then I can understand it and I can argue the matter with him. But if one quite coldbloodedly adopts the attitude that one dare not impose them on people over a certain age, for tomorrow or the day after they will no longer be there and will no longer be able to use the money, what remains of one&#x2019;s patriotism&#x003F; After all, one does not save for oneself, and what one is building up is not for oneself. One is building up for posterity. One is building up a father-land for all future generations, to stand as a proud monument for a nation. Must we be like the Irishman who said: &#x201C;Why bother about posterity; what has posterity done for me&#x003F;&#x201D; Surely that is not the attitude we should adopt in this House. Surely that is not the spirit we should encourage among our people. Sir, if the time has ever come for a spirit to emanate from, for an appeal to go out to our people from the leaders of this House, whether on this side or on that side&#x2014;the duty rests <span class="col_367-368" refersTo="page_0197"/>on us both&#x2014;to be more selfless, then that time is now.</p>

<p>I was genuinely shocked by the cynical materialism in the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the speeches made by so many hon. members on the opposite side. Have we no faith&#x003F; Have we no idealism&#x003F; Are there not more important things&#x003F; When appeals which were made to work harder are termed puerile, then my blood runs cold. Then I think of the report I read in the <i>Argus</i> the other evening to the effect that last year in Britain alone, in the year 1970, 11 million man-days were lost through strikes where people did not work. Heaven knows we as parliamentarians&#x2014;and I am not saying this about my side of the House only, I am also saying it about hon. members on the opposite side of the House&#x2014; are a group of people who have every right to ask people to work harder, because we work hard. There is no doubt about that at all. To work 14 to 16 hours a day is nothing. I say that we therefore need not feel ashamed on our part to ask people to work harder. Therefore it is foolish and recklessly irresponsible to talk about working harder as being puerile.</p>

<p>But the hon. member, the deputy leader of the United Party, was not satisfied with that. He also said: &#x201C;In any case, why should we save if the Government takes our money and wastes it&#x003F;&#x201D; Sir, I have been sitting in this House for many years, and every year every cent of the revenue and expenditure of this Government is tabulated in the White Book which is laid upon the Table here. I have seldom, if ever, heard a single hon. member on the opposite side criticize any amount in that White Book as an amount, except to say that it was inadequate. I now ask hon. members this: On what grounds is the general accusation being made&#x2014;which is being sent out into the world&#x2014;that the Government takes money and wastes it&#x003F; What is the Opposition doing here then&#x003F; Bring me a Hansard in which the Opposition referred to a sum of money appearing on the Estimates and said that it was a waste and that it should be deleted, except in the case of a Minister&#x2019;s salary.</p>

<p>I am not talking about general arguments which were raised. I am talking about amounts which were spent. Even in respect of the Bantustans those hon. members have never yet questioned a single amount. That is the fact of the matter. Indeed, we have been reproached with spending too little and progressing too slowly. That hon. member knows as well as I do that, in spite of the fact that it is always being said in this House that we are spending too little money, he himself is an exponent during elections of the standpoint that we &#x201C;are spending too much on the Kaffirs&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow, without any reason, put forward the view that there is a crisis prevailing in South Africa in the economic sphere. Sir, there is no crisis in South Africa. Whose purpose and what purpose are we serving here in the Parliament of South Africa by saying that there is a crisis in South Africa&#x003F; Just suppose the people outside believed him&#x003F; Surely there is no crisis in South Africa. There are in fact problems, which we can discuss across the floor of the House and of which we are all aware. Let me say at once that these are problems which, as in the past, will be solved by the National Party. I want, with all due respect, to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: What purpose do we serve by running down our fatherland in this way&#x003F; I shall return to this later.</p>

<p>If one were to read only the Opposition members&#x2019; Hansard of this debate, what impression would one get of South Africa&#x003F; In this regard I must exclude the hon. member for Pinelands, for on at least two occasions I heard him refer quite correctly to South Africa&#x2019;s economy as &#x201C;our strong economy&#x201D;. What impression must people outside get of South Africa&#x2019;s economy if they were to listen only to hon. members on the opposite side&#x003F; After listening to those hon. members and reading their Hansard, I could not help thinking of the story of an old fellow I knew, who was ill. He was not very ill, but his wife used to sit at his bedside. When you went to visit there and you asked the old fellow how he was getting along, she would give him no chance at all to reply. She would say: &#x201C;Things are not going very well. I do not think he will last very much longer.&#x201D; Sir, three weeks later she had talked him into the grave. Whatever hon. members on the opposite side may do, I want to ask them not to do this to South Africa.</p>

<p>While we are dealing with this point now, and while the hon. member for Pinelands repeatedly referred to South Africa&#x2019;s &#x201C;strong economy&#x201D;, surely all of us know <span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0198"/>what the situation in 1948 and in those years was. Surely we know what kind of economy we had and what kind of industrialization we had. After all, we know what went on here during those years and that with the advent of the National Party Government a revolution took place here in South Africa, so much so that people are quite unable to recognize South Africa if they compare it to what it was in those days. The hon. member for Pinelands spoke of our &#x201C;strong economy&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is very welcome to debate that matter with me on another occasion. At the moment we are dealing with a motion by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. If the hon. member for Durban (Point) wants to include that question of his in next year&#x2019;s motion of no confidence, I shall then furnish him with a full reply.</p>

<p>I ask again: What assistance did we receive from the United Party and its Press in building up our economy after Sharpeville&#x003F; In my New Year&#x2019;s Message I gave my considered opinion on various matters, and I do not want to return to them today, except for one of them. I said in my New Year&#x2019;s Message that 1971 would bring many economic problems in many countries. Yesterday, for example, we saw what has happened in Britain with the Rolls Royce firm, a firm which, so we thought, was as strong as the Bank of England. No, I say that what is needed for the future&#x2014;and I am saying this regardless of party affiliations&#x2014;is a spirit of realism, quite right, but also a spirit of optimism, for after all we know what this common fatherland of ours is capable of, and I invite the Opposition to help to develop that spirit.</p>

<p>A characteristic of this motion by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is that its keynote is seen by everyone as being a concentrated attack on separation and a preparing of the way for the elimination of dividing lines and consequently for equality here in South Africa. That is my view of this motion and I shall motivate this view of mine as I go along.</p>

<p>For years now the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has been waging a campaign both within and outside this House against what he calls petty (klein) apartheid. He has been doing so without petty apartheid ever having been defined by him and without mentioning any specific examples. This is merely a psychosis which is being created against petty apartheid, without it being defined. I have said at political meetings and told political correspondents of newspapers that if in Heaven&#x2019;s name they would only tell me what petty apartheid is, I would also be able to take part in that discussion.</p>

<p>No, <i>Die Burger</i> has not defined it, not to my knowledge. If the hon. member wants to give me such a definition, he is very welcome to do so. I am dealing for the moment with the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He has for a very long time now been waging a campaign against petty apartheid. When he discusses it in the House he has quite a number of people whom he hitches to his cart. I have nothing to say about those gentlemen, except that they themselves should say whether they are content to be hitched to the hon. member <span class="col_371-372" refersTo="page_0199"/>for Bezuidenhout&#x2019;s cart, particularly after his latest statement and his association with them. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout made a particularly important statement in this debate. Of course, one cannot view the speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in isolation. His speech must be read in conjunction with the speech made by the hon. member for Durban (North), for the two are very closely interrelated. While the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has very often in the past discussed petty apartheid, he gave a very candid reply this time to the question of the Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration, Dr. Koornhof. The question put to him was whether immorality is petty apartheid.</p>

<p>That is the question that was put. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout gave a very candid reply to that; he said&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would say it is one of the pettiest aspects of petty apartheid. Yes, I should have said it is one of the crudest and coarsest aspects of crude apartheid.</p>

He is a useful one for closing loopholes. To tell the truth, my hon. friend has become worn out already because he has had to do this so often.

If it is the pettiest or the crudest aspect of apartheid, then surely apartheid in restaurants is infinitely pettier and coarser&#x003F; Then surely segregation in cinemas is quite odious.

<p>Petty <i>(klein)</i> apartheid&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; is (1) where colour, skin colour, is the determining factor; (2) which is enforced by a White authority by means of penal provisions without any recognition of the wishes of the non-White population groups affected. It therefore does not include exclusive practices which are based on private practice or custom or on the private choice of people and groups of people, or on consultation of and agreement among the various colour groups; (3) which is simply humiliating for some or other group of people and has virtually nothing to do with honest development.</p>

<p>That is the hon. member&#x2019;s definition. As I said, it goes to the root of our race problems and our relationships problems here in South Africa. Since we have now for the first time received a definition, and from a front-bencher of the United Party at that, who, if I understood him correctly, has already given it to the press &#x2026;</p>

If the hon. the Leader remains silent, I shall be forced to conclude that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is right. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will be forced to bear the blame if our people outside also see it in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout states here &#x201C;Which is enforced by a White authority by means of penal provisions without any recognition of the wishes of the non-White population groups affected&#x201D;, in other words, without a general referendum or something else having been held in regard to the matter, it dare not be done. Now we should like to know whether this is also the standpoint of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must in any case tell us where he stands. I should now like to make this definition available to the hon. the Leader.</p>

<p>In general I want to state that this type of sexual misconduct (<i>ontug)</i> is a form of immorality. It is a lustful form of immorality of the coarsest type. I want to make it very clear that I believe that there is a positive obligation resting on every one of us in this House, instead of condoning it, to express our strongest disapproval of it.

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not have the time now. The hon. member may do so later. We must oppose the spirit of permissiveness as never before. Whereas world leaders are deploring this and we must witness every day how permissiveness is eroding the Western world, I am sorry that not a single word was said about this by hon. members on the opposite side throughout this entire no-confidence debate. Far be it from me to be indifferent to the sufferings of wives and children. This is a very distressing matter, but I want to say that when a husband appears in court for any offence, is found guilty and then appeals to the mercy of the court because his wife and children will suffer as a result, it leaves me cold, because he should have thought of that before committing the offence. Then his wife and children simply become a subterfuge which he tries to use to escape the consequences of his actions. It is time we told these people, when arguments of this kind are raised, that they should think of these and all the other asocial aspects before they allow their lustfulness to get the better of them in this way.</p>

<p>Now I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, as well as the hon. members for Bezuidenhout and Yeoville, that the rules of this House provide that one may not attack a substantive law without introducing a motion or Bill in Parliament for its repeal. If the Immorality Act as such is alleged to be the pettiest aspect of petty apartheid and the crudest aspect of crude apartheid, if it is such an evil thing, if it is true that what the hon. member stated in that document and signed his name to is his standpoint, if that is the policy of the United Party, and while hon. members on the opposite side are hiding behind the provision of the Standing Orders to the effect that you may not attack an Act of Parliament, I now want to address this open invitation to him. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to repeal or amend by means of substantive legislation in this Parliament the Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act, which according to their shadow Minister of Justice are closely interdependent, so that it is not possible to abolish or retain the one without the other, I now give him the undertaking in advance that this side of the House will in this very session set aside the necessary time to do so. If there has ever been a time when each side should test the <i>bona fides</i> of the other, it is now. If we must put to the test what people are joining in saying and shouting because it has become the fashion in certain newspapers to write about this, and if that support <i>(saampraat)</i> of theirs means that both the Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act should be repealed, I shall afford the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity during this session to debate these Acts in full. Then we can, apart from the motion of the hon. member, which I only heard about today, have legislation here before Parliament. Let us then debate it and state our honest standpoint to the world outside. As far as this side of the House is concerned, the standpoint was stated by the hon. the Minister of Justice, and that is what the National Party has to say about it.</p>

<p>I come now to the motion of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. It is true, and I want to concede openly to the hon. the Leader&#x2014;in fact, I have already done so on many other occasions&#x2014;that he achieved some success, both in the Parliamentary election and in the provincial election. But, Sir, one must also view that success in perspective. For the sake of the record I think it is necessary for us to state precisely what the Opposition has achieved. Looking at the seats, I have, to my regret, only 12 per cent of them in Natal. I see that in the Cape Province I have 66 per cent of the seats; that in the Transvaal I have almost 75 per cent of the seats; and that in South-West Africa and in the Orange Free State I have 100 per cent of the seats. One must therefore see that success in perspective as well, and in spite of what we are saying now, my hon. friend knows very well and I know that he has an infinitely long way to go and that he is on a journey to never-never land if he thinks he is going to come into power.</p>

<p><span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0203"/>Sir, I come now to the first of a series of personal accusations levelled at me by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. With the first of those accusations he questioned not only my credibility, but also my honour. He levelled the accusation at me that I had, according to him, said one thing in this House and that Gen. Van den Bergh had in his evidence in the Marais case said the opposite. Sir, that is not true. Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggested that Gen. Van den Bergh had stated in the Maris case that the Security Police were listening in to telephone conversations, I want to inform him that Gen. Van den Bergh gave no such evidence. I also want to inform him that Brig. Venter, the chief of the Security Police, who gave evidence, gave no such evidence. Of course, I had the problem that this case was heard <i>in camera,</i> and although the rules of this House allow it, it would be improper to refer to that evidence even in this House and even if one had it, and I did not have it. I consequently did the correct thing which one ought to do under such circumstances. I applied through the Attorney-General to the trial judge concerned to give me permission to deal with the relevant accusation in this House, and I am very grateful that the hon. trial judge gave me that permission. I am therefore doing this with the permission of the judge. The fact of the matter is that the question was specifically put to Gen. Van den Bergh as to whether the Security Police listened in to telephone conversations, and his reply in court, because he believed that it was not relevant in that case, was that he did not want to reply to that question. He also stated in terms of which Act he did not want to reply, viz. section 32 of the Official Secrets Act. There was argument between counsel for the accused and the court in regard to this matter, and after the court had heard counsel, the court ruled that no reply need be given to that question. Similarly this is also what happened in the case of Brig. Venter. Because I do not want to place the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in an impossible position, I want to say that I am aware of the fact that he made that accusation on the basis of what was said in the judgment of the hon. judge in the Appeal Court, viz. that Gen. Van den Bergh &#x201C;also referred to methods which were used to obtain information, <i>inter alia,</i> infiltration of subversive organizations by agents of the Security Police, listening-in&#x2014; not to telephone conversations&#x2014;the interrogation and following of suspects and the interception of mail. It appears that reference has been made to these methods in various newspapers and books&#x201D;. It is quite clear from the case what the listening-in referred to here was, and Gen. Van den Bergh gave evidence in this regard. Counsel for the defence mentioned to him the Jean Strachan case, where listening-in took place in a flat. This was not a question of listening in to a telephone conversation; it was done with other apparatus. Evidence was given on this in the Strachan case, and Gen. Van den Bergh was asked whether that type of listening-in was a method used by the Security Police and he said &#x201C;Yes, it is a method&#x201D;. Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has now drawn that conclusion in respect of mail, I want to say that this was also put to Gen. Van den Bergh, in reference to the Ludi case, when the latter testified in the Fischer case that he had on behalf of the Communist Party rented a postbox for the Communist Party, collected the mail in that postbox and redirected it to the Police instead of sending it to the Communist Party, for which it was intended. That is what the judge was referring to, and in no way to the matter which my hon. friend mentioned here. My hon. friend drew the wrong conclusions from what was said here, and all I have done now is to give him the correct facts for the sake of the record, and I think that he accepts it in that spirit. I am glad he does so.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also referred to a matter which occurred here last year, i.e. the clash between the member for Newton Park and, if I may put it in this way, his Man Friday. In spite of the opportunity the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had last year to cross swords with me on this matter, he now comes along and says that I owe the two gentlemen an apology in that connection. I just want to make this very clear to him: I dealt with this matter across the floor of the House; I said I was leaving the two gentlemen to their own consciences, and as far as I am concerned, I have in both senses of the word finished with them.</p>

<p>You lost.</p>

<p>*The PRIME MINISTER: Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked me about the Potgieter Commission. I am glad he asked me that question, because it gives me a parliamentary opportunity to clear it up. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if I understood him correctly, was <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0204"/>particularly interested in and concerned about section 29 in this connection. Sir, I want to make this very clear. I did not appoint the Potgieter Commission to report on section 29. That is a minor, subsidiary part. If it had been apartheid, it would have been the pettiest of apartheid in regard to the report. The main reason for my appointing the Potgieter Commission was to establish a security set-up for South Africa which, if possible, should be the best in the world. Sir, without being presumptuous, because it happens to be the position as a result of the office which I held in the most difficult years, namely that of Minister of Justice in the difficult early sixties, I can state with a clear conscience that no-one sitting in this House has more experience of modern subversion, of the modern dangers arising from that, than I have. That is why this is of particular importance to me, because hon. members will recall that we never really had a service in the past, as we were a small subdivision of Britain&#x2019;s service. It was only since the last war that we began to build up our own service here in South Africa. Hon. members know the circumstances. As far as I am concerned, because I am aware, as my colleague the hon. the Minister of Defence is aware, that our worst difficulties are still to come, perhaps in two or three years&#x2019; time, if the threats being uttered against us should ever be translated into reality, it is absolutely essential that South Africa should have the best set-up possible. That is also why I asked the hon. judge concerned to investigate all matters in that connection, and that is why I told him that if it should be necessary, he should go overseas and investigate every possible system. He did so, and I should like to add that one of the most thorough reports one could possibly compile has been compiled. But it is a very long report. Altogether it comprises five volumes, and I now want to tell the hon. member that I have not yet had the time to study it properly, as it should be studied, because there are dozens of implications, if not hundreds, to which very thorough consideration must be given. I want to inform the hon. the Leader that I took it with me on vacation; I had received it before the time, when I was ill, but there was simply no time to give it the attention I must give it. I took it along on vacation with the firm intention of reading it, but I want to tell the hon. Leader, and I am making no excuse for this being so, that I was so tired I did not get round to doing so; and I think I deserved a vacation, even if it was only seen from his point of view, on account of the drubbings he had given me. Consequently I have not yet, I repeat, had the time to give that report the attention it deserves, but I hope to be able to do so during the next few weeks; and as soon as I have done so, and as soon as that long report has been translated, it will be laid upon the Table. But I want to repeat that I am in earnest in respect of this set-up, and I regard it as one of the tasks I must perform in public life, and I should like to perform it as well as I possibly can.</p>

<p>Then my hon. friend referred to the Agliotti transaction, which the <i>Sunday Times</i> suddenly became terribly excited about. I told him by way of a reply, just to place this on record, that I only received the report on 22nd January, since it had been handed in to my office during the vacation. That report was referred to the authorities concerned, and I can say no more than that it will soon be laid upon the Table and that those responsible will be dealt with according to the law. That goes without saying. That is the reason why I appointed that commission and I think that instead of levelling reproaches, the hon. the Leader should at least have given me credit for the R5 million that was saved in connection with the matter.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, this is no ordinary motion of no-confidence. This is a motion coming from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who says he is about to take over and that this Government is useless. Under those circumstances I would have expected the Leader of the Opposition to cover the whole field. Sir, a government does not only have to deal with manpower shortages; it has to deal with many other things. <i>Inter alia,</i> the government of any country has to deal with the whole outside world, and not only in this debate but also in the course of the debates last year, did not a word of criticism come from the hon. member on how the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and myself have dealt with foreign matters. I must therefore accept, in view of the fact that it is not an ordinary motion of no-confidence, but a motion of no-confidence coming from an Opposition which is about to take over from a <span class="col_383-384" refersTo="page_0205"/>government which is about to fall to pieces, that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has no criticism to offer and has no objection to any of the things done by the hon. the Minister or by myself in that regard.</p>

<p>It is also interesting that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say a word about one of the most fundamental problems South Africa had to deal with, namely the gold problem, which was handled by my hon. colleague next to me, and handled in the most brilliant fashion. It is also interesting that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not see fit to comment on the peace and the quiet that exist in this country. It is also interesting, if this is such a useless Government, that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition could find no criticism and could not lay any accusation at the door of the Government that there is labour unrest in this country, whereas it has become the hallmark of very many countries overseas.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that not a word has come from him about the Cape sea route and what has been done by this Government to bring it to the attention of the World Powers, and with success. It is also interesting that he did not say a word about the way this &#x201C;useless&#x201D; Government has protected the borders of South Africa. Frankly, I do not blame the hon. member for not saying anything about the Simonstown Agreement. I myself would not have talked about it were it not for the fact that the White Paper came out in the British Parliament yesterday, I want to say in connection with the White Paper and the statements made in the British Parliament that it will be premature for me, or anyone else, at this stage to make a detailed statement before having had time to study it in detail. But I think it is necessary that I should say at this moment that I note that the British Government now accepts the view that they have legal obligations under the Simonstown Agreement, a view the South African Government has always held, and we are giving this matter our closest consideration.</p>

<p>Whilst I am on this subject, I want to say further that I heartily welcome the following extract from the speech of Mr. Heath, the British Prime Minister, for whom I have a very high regard, when he said on 26th January, 1971&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I set out fully the grounds on which, for reasons of practical common sense and straightforward dealing, it has seemed to us that it would be in the spirit of these joint arrangements which remain valid and relevant and which no Commonwealth Government has asked us to abandon, to continue to supply the limited categories of equipment needed to enable South Africa to play her part.</block>

<p>I am very pleased that those words came from the Prime Minister of Britain. I am particularly pleased that he spoke of the spirit of the Agreement because, after all, the Simonstown Agreement is not only an agreement of the letter. It is that, but it is more than that. It is also an agreement of spirit. I was very pleased to note the word &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; in Mr. Heath&#x2019;s statement.</p>

<p>Again, Sir, whilst I am on the subject, it has become necessary for me, in view of what has been said at Singapore, and after Singapore, to emphasize that South Africa not only does not want, but also does not need arms to fight Black people in South Africa or outside South Africa. As far as our own Black people are concerned I cannot visualize the day when it will ever be necessary to use arms against them, for the simple reason that they and we have demonstrated to the world that as far as the southern portion of Africa is concerned, we understand each other, and that in spite of our disagreements and in spite of what the world outside has to say, White and Black and Brown will resolve all their difficulties to the advantage of each and every group in this country. I say therefore that I can, under no circumstances, foresee any time when it will be necessary to use arms manufactured in South Africa or imported from abroad against our Black people. I say that it is malicious to suggest or say that that is South Africa&#x2019;s intention. It is malicious to say that any arms South Africa acquires from Britain or from any other power will be used for that purpose. As far as the rest of Africa is concerned, we as a people have no intention of fighting against or of invading any other country, be it near or far. I am now not talking for myself or for my party alone; I am talking on behalf of the whole House and of South Africa. There is absolutely no need for us to do so and we simply have no intention in that regard. I want to spell that out as clearly as I possibly can. I just cannot see such a situation arising. The only time it could possibly arise would be if people were to play big and want to prove just <span class="col_385-386" refersTo="page_0206"/>how tough they are. They will then naturally find out their mistake very soon.</p>

<p>I do not need to say anything further about that, but I do want to refer in passing to the absolute nonsense spoken by Kaunda, the President of Zambia. I want to say that it is quite untrue that we are about to invade Zambia or that we want to do this, that or the other thing to Tanzania or any other country, as he has suggested on many occasions. That is just pure nonsense. Now, in all seriousness, Kaunda is not only irresponsible; he is also a double-talker. I want to say in all sincerity that there is one thing President Kaunda must do, and he must do it quickly, and that is to stop playing the big man in the world. He must look after the interests of his own people. That is all I ask him to do. All I ask him and any other leader in Africa to do, is to look after the interests of his own people. If he does not, he may very well find himself in the same aeroplane as Obote. I have said that President Kaunda is not only irresponsible, but is also a double talker. I want to say in all seriousness that in the course of the discussion of my Vote later this year in Parliament, I will expose President Kaunda for just that&#x2014;and he should take note of that.</p>

<p>*I have referred to the fact that, as leaders of the people, whether we belong to the same party or not, we all have a duty. That duty also entails presenting an image of South Africa which is worthy of South Africa. I am saying this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. If he would read his speech again, he could argue with me about whether it is as I am now going to say or not. If an objective person were to read his speech, he would have to come to the conclusion that South Africa is a useless country. I can understand an opposition wanting to come into power. But trying to do so by means of sensation-mongering, suspicion-mongering, exploiting grievances, misrepresentation and reckless promises, has never brought an opposition into power. After all, a people chooses its own government. As regards my party and myself, I want to make it clear that I do not strive to remain in power at all costs. I am not prepared to change my policy and to take up a standpoint at the insistence of any person merely to stay in power. I am only prepared to remain in power here in South Africa if the electorate puts me here on my programme of principles and my policy. That standpoint of mine is based on the policy of separate development. That policy in turn is based on the difference which exists between my race group and the other race groups in South Africa, in other words, between those who belong to me and the others who belong to other leaders in this country. I want to state quite candidly that not only the Opposition, but also people outside this House, quite often read things into the policy of separate development which it does not contain. My trouble with others, on the other hand, is that they want to read out of the policy that which it does contain. One must guard against this. But there is one thing against which one must guard, especially if you are the Leader of the Opposition, and so must my hon. friends on the other side who are criticizing us, and this is what was so neatly put by the hon. member for Lydenburg when he said in the course of this debate: Hon. members on the other side argue about separate development as if it means antagonism between White and non-White. It is presented as a policy which is aimed at fanning this. The policy is, on the contrary, aimed at having precisely the opposite effect, namely to ensure peace and friendship for all persons and the different peoples of South Africa. The policy is not&#x2014;as the reproach is often made&#x2014; aimed at our making second-class citizens of people here or anywhere. On the contrary, the policy is aimed at letting those people develop in their own right and not as an appendage of the White man who always has to take a back seat. The policy makes it possible for them to take a front seat in their own areas. The policy is not a denial of the human dignity of any human being. On the contrary, it is the emphasizing of the human dignity of all God&#x2019;s creatures living in Southern Africa, including the Coloured people, the Bantu and the Asiatics. Hon. members attack that policy so lightly and are so quick to be disparaging about it. But the attitude which I always adopt and which I consistently put to foreigners as well, irrespective of the capacities in which they stand, is that, together with my people, I wish to retain my identity as a White man here in South Africa. I do not think there is a single person on the other side who will quarrel with me when I say that I wish to retain my identity. All that arises from this is the question: how am I to retain my identity&#x003F; Is it being hostile towards a Black man <span class="col_387-388" refersTo="page_0207"/>when I tell him that I wish to retain my identity&#x003F; Do I insult him by telling him this&#x003F; On the contrary, he is just as keen on retaining his identity if he is a decent Black man, and the majority of them are decent, for which I am grateful. He also wants to retain his identity, just as I want to retain mine, but then there are always those people who do not want to retain it and who want to make it impossible to do so. I have no problems with the large mass of people. I do have problems, as is the case with any crime, with the individual few who do not want to adhere to the norms. After all, this is our basic problem, and these are the people against whom we must have laws and take up a standpoint and make regulations.</p>

<p>Let us above all guard against holding out promises which we cannot fulfil. Let us guard against being incited by newspaper-men or by the creation of a climate to hold out things to the non-White people in theory which we know very well we cannot or will not give them in practice. No matter whether it is the Opposition or the National Party, if we want to succeed in this country and keep on living here, there is one thing we must definitely see to, and that is that we are blatantly honest towards the non-White peoples.</p>

<p>I am hurrying, because I am sorry to have kept the House so long. There is the accusation, which lies at the root of this motion, in regard to labour. I have said that the National Party can deal with this matter. It will deal with it too. It is the National Party, with that legislation and those regulations which are being attacked, which has made South Africa the prosperous country it is today. It will be the National Party which will lead it further. Each of my predecessors, when dealing with this policy and when attacks were made by hon. members on the other side, gave South Africa the assurance which I have also given and which I want to repeat today, namely that our policy will not lead to disruption in South Africa. We will see to it and we guarantee that there will be no disruption in South Africa. I want to repeat today that if there is one thing I am afraid of, it is unemployment here in South Africa. As surely as I hold this position, I will not allow it if it is in my power to prevent it. I will not allow it, because this, more than anything else, could eventually lead to my downfall.</p>

<p>I want to reply to the accusation levelled by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to the effect that the hon. the Minister of Labour has granted many exemptions. It is true that the hon. the Minister of Labour grants exemptions. He has done so from time to time and he will continue to do so from time to time. He grants the exemptions in accordance with the undertaking given in this House by the National Party &#x2014;and this is my reply to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that we will see to one thing, and that is that our policy will not cause disruption. We shall continue in that spirit. Not only did we say that we would not allow disruption, but we also said that we would not jeopardize the livelihood of any White man by the implementation of our policy. And we will not do so either.</p>

<p>At the same time we will give the non-White peoples their due and what can under the circumstances be granted to them in their own areas and in other spheres. As far as our policy is concerned, it will therefore bring about no disruption whatsoever in the economic sphere. There are bottle-necks and problems, and I know this very well. We discussed them across the floor of this House last year. My hon. colleague had to deal with them in his discussions with industrialists and others. As a result the Rieckert Committee was appointed to go into this matter. It is hoped that the report of the Committee will be presented in six weeks&#x2019; time. After all, we are not indifferent to these matters and to the development of South Africa; we have brought the country where it is, and why would we now want to throw it overboard&#x003F;</p>

<p>Not only will we see to it that there is no disruption in the economic sphere, but we will assuredly as long as we are in power, see to it that in the political field non-Whites have no say over Whites and over White South Africa. On this point we must be judged by the South African electorate. If they want to vote against us, they have every right to do so. They have the right to choose a government for themselves every five years. After all, I am not insulting a non-White by telling him that he will have no say over me. In fact, I have discussed this matter openly with the leaders of the non-White peoples. I put all my cards on the table and I kept nothing back. They did not think that I was insulting them. I discuss matters with the Coloured leaders and with the Indian leaders much more often than the hon. members think. We discuss these matters frankly and <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0208"/>not one of them has yet told me that I was insulting them by saying this. But our policy is also aimed at preventing integration and friction in the social sphere. If the South African electorate find that they no longer want this and that they have to kick me out, then I will go, but on this I stand or fall with my party. There must be no friction and no integration in South Africa.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that if I were asked today what South Africa is, I would say that South Africa is a small, multi-national country whose people, thank God, mind their own business. It is a country which seeks peace and friendship with everyone who will give it on a reciprocal basis. It is a country in which there is work for all who wish to work, both Whites and non-Whites. It is a country which creates prospects and opportunities for all the people in it. It is a country which still believes in the virtues of morality, diligence, thrift and all the other fine virtues with which we grew up. It is a country which will resist greed among its people, which is becoming very marked in places, and which will resist practises which, as a result of greed, border on extravagance. It is a country which has its problems and its difficulties. This is my considered opinion as I put it in my New Year&#x2019;s Message, and I quote:</p>

<block name="quote">It is my conviction that there are no instant solutions to all these problems. The quality of our products, the sincerity of our attitude, the achievements of our scientists and the standard of our sportsmen are the best and most effective counter-measures against these attacks on South Africa.</block>

<p>There are problems. But we do not have a crisis; it is a question of an overheated economy which requires measures to be taken to cool it off, and these measures will be taken. This is a country, so I shall tell people, of distinguished scientists in all fields. Thank God, I can say it is a country in which there are responsible workers and fine young people. It is a country which still attaches importance to old-fashioned virtues, which still has self-respect. But it is also a country whose people are still humble before God.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what we have just heard from the hon. the Prime Minister is undoubtedly an interesting speech&#x2014;interesting from a parliamentary point of view, interesting from the point of view of the tactics employed and followed by the hon. gentleman.

<block name="quote">This is an unyielding standpoint on an extremely difficult and delicate matter in regard to which there is undoubtedly restlessness in the country.

<p>I do not think that there is the slightest doubt that everybody in South Africa is opposed to miscegenation. As one is opposed to miscegenation, one does not advocate mixed marriages. Although one is opposed to miscegenation, there are various methods for preventing it. When this Act was placed on the Statute Book, we sounded the warning that it might do a great deal of harm, and also pointed out the good it might do. When these people were charged, the Police knew right from the start that there would be no evidence over and above that of the accomplices, apart from the fact that there were bastard children. The fact that there were bastard children, proves that an offence did take place, but it does not link the White man concerned to the offence.</p>

<p>Precisely; in other words, there were admissions by accomplices. It strikes me as being very irresponsible&#x2014;and this I want to put on record here&#x2014;to arrest people, to make them go through all this suffering and to allow their families to go through such <span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0210"/>suffering before the accomplice who has to give evidence against them, has been convicted and the assurance has been obtained that they will in fact give evidence. Does any Attorney-General really expect any White person who is to be charged with an offence of this nature, not to obtain the services of attorneys or advocates to defend him&#x003F; Do they really think that the trouble will not be taken to ensure that the women will be defended as well&#x003F; Does he really think that any advocate or attorney who knows his job, will advise them to agree to giving evidence when he knows that none of them can be found guilty unless that evidence is given&#x003F; It seems to me that this was an extremely unfortunate incident, and I am not absolving the Minister of Justice and his Department from being responsible for it. In passing I want to add that I do not quite agree either with the exposition of the law which we had from the hon. the Minister. The hon. gentleman made no mention of section 254, which deals with the evidence of accomplices. If a man or a woman is in fact convicted, he or she is a competent witness in a case. In that case he is no longer indicted in the same court for the same offence as that of the other people. The trials are not coupled. He is a competent witness. I cannot see why section 212 cannot be made applicable to him. Nor do I find it in the Statute Books. It may be that I have got out of practice and am not so expert at looking these things up any more, but in my experience this has never been the position.</p>

<p>Now I want to proceed. When we find ourselves in the position&#x2014;as was evident from a reply to a question in this House to a former Minister of Justice&#x2014;that in one year&#x2019;s time 45 per cent of those charged with this particular offence was acquitted, it appears to me that there is a hitch somewhere. If one examines the figures in the Police Report on normal offences in South Africa, one finds that 75 per cent of those who are charged, are convicted. Only 25 per cent is acquitted. But in this extremely sensitive and delicate type of case, we find that 45 per cent of those who are charged, are acquitted. Furthermore, it seems to me as though insufficient attention is being given to the matter to ensure that people are not endangered and made to go through all the suffering before the Police have made sure of their case. I think that when those facts are reviewed, there is a good case for a commission to examine this legislation and to take evidence from the police, members of the judiciary, who have to pass the sentences, sociologists, members of the churches and prominent people in our country, to see whether we cannot find another kind of solution. These are my views on this matter. I had hoped that the hon. the Prime Minister would also see the matter in this light, even if, by doing so, it were only to do less damage to South Africa&#x2019;s reputation in the outside world as a result of failures of lawsuits &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. gentlemen raised certain other matters which I find interesting. He spoke about the Simonstown Agreement. In that regard I want to say that, although I also feel that this is not a suitable time for commenting on the matter, I agree with him that it will be a pity if the commitment to supply South Africa with arms, is based on points of law and not on the moral obligation which I have always felt to stem from that agreement.</p>

<p>The Hon. the Prime Minister also intimated that he stood by his policy. He does not care what attitude is adopted by the people; they must accept him with his policy; he is not going to deviate from it. Sir, I appreciate that attitude. I hope that the members of his Cabinet who have in the past blown hot and cold to a certain extent, have given ear to that. In the future we may be in a position to define the policy of this Government with greater accuracy. Then the hon. gentleman developed his case to some extent by discussing his apartheid policy and saying that he would see to it that it did not have a disruptive effect on the economy. Mr. Speaker, I want to give the hon. gentleman this piece of advice, i.e. that he may as well abandon that policy now, for there is not the slightest doubt that if he wishes to implement this policy successfully, it is going to have a disruptive effect on the economy. To proceed: The hon. the Minister of Finance appreciated this when he said years ago that he was prepared to bend the economy in order to implement his policy. There is not the slightest doubt that that policy is going to have a disruptive effect on the economy, and if it is not going to have a disruptive effect on <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0211"/>the economy, I make him a gift of this piece of advice: He may as well abandon that policy, for it will never be implemented in South Africa.</p>

<p>Then it was interesting to note that the hon. gentleman referred to the fact that the farmers had not been mentioned specifically in this debate. Sir, that is an entirely new attitude on the part of the Government. I still remember very well how I raised the question of the farming community in South Africa in the course of the discussion on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote a few years ago, before the hon. gentleman had become Prime Minister himself; and what was said to me by the other side&#x003F; I was told that on the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote I had to discuss matters of national importance; not the position of the farming community in South Africa. Sir, that stands recorded in Hansard.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>That was the attitude adopted by this Government towards the farming community of South Africa. Mr. Speaker, there is another thing I want to add: There is no single section of the population that has been affected more by the rising prices that is the case with the farming community in South Africa, and there is no single section that has found that its production costs have risen more because of price increases in other sectors of the economy, and whereas we are pleading for a rapidly growing and sound economy and for steps to be taken to put an end to this inflation which cannot be curbed, there is not the slightest doubt that in South Africa the farming community will benefit most if this were done.</p>

<p>Then the hon. gentleman also referred to the development of our economy after Sharpeville. Yes, Sir, but who was panic-stricken after Sharpeville; by whom was exchange control applied for the first time in the history of South Africa&#x003F; Who was it that pegged interest rates at a stage when they should not have done so&#x003F; Who took one step after the other which temporarily brought our whole economy into difficulties, the result being that the businessmen of South Africa were saying that the economy was doing well in spite of this Government&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, then the hon. gentleman referred to the waste of money as regards this Government. This is something with which I should like to deal later on and of which I shall furnish examples.</p>

<p>Sir, when I introduced this motion, I mentioned three specific matters on which a motion of no confidence could possibly be based, and one of them was the way in which our transport in South Africa had, under the guidance of this Government, fallen behind to such an extent that at present our transport is unable to convey our iron ore, coal, anthracite and numerous other things for export, which would be to the greatest benefit and of the greatest value to us in trying to straighten out our balance of payments in South Africa. The other side has admitted defeat in that regard. We did not even have a defence, not even an attempt to justify it, and I must assume that hon. members opposite are agreed with me that for lack of far-sightedness on the part of this Government, transport in South Africa has been allowed to fall behind to such an extent that at the present stage it is having a detrimental effect on economy.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I mentioned the fishing industry in South Africa. The matter was taken further by the hon. member for Simonstad, and the hon. the Deputy Minister of Finance replied to that. The hon. the Deputy Minister admitted that over-exploitation had taken place. He openly admitted that this had happened. He said that he had no knowledge of certain matters in regard to the South African West Coast fishing industry, as these were things that had happened before he became a member of Parliament or before he was taken up in the Cabinet. But, Mr. Speaker, there is such a thing such as Cabinet responsibility, and I do not have the slightest doubt that I have the right to say today that this Government is responsible for the collapse of the West Coast pilchard industry. The Government cannot say that there has not been any warnings. In my maiden speech twenty-three years ago I made mention in this House of this danger and asked that research be carried out and that restrictive measures be applied. I referred to the disaster which had hit America. Since those days a disaster has also hit the Japanese fishing industry. But, in spite of these things this Government carried on merrily. What is more, there is not the slightest doubt that the research work that was carried out, was inadequate. The 1967 commission mentioned this; they said it was their impression that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_397-398" refersTo="page_0212"/>&#x2026; the existing dissatisfaction in regard to the inadequate resource research as carried out at present is justified.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not going to take the matter any further. They have had experience of what happened in Japan; they have had experience of what happened in America, and now they have had the experience of what has happened on our West Coast. I positively express the hope that with that experience they will take the necessary steps to ensure that as far as pilchards are concerned, the South-West African fishing industry will not be allowed to collapse as well. I was pleased to note that there had been a further curb as regards quotas. However, you should remember, Sir, that it was this Government and this Minister of Finance, when he was Minister of Economic Affairs, who persuaded the South-West Africa Administration to grant licences to those factory ships, which have been the major cause of the trouble. I think they did make certain conditions applicable, but, surely, it should have been clear to anyone with some foresight that it would be very difficult to ensure that those conditions would be complied with. Anyone with any knowledge of the fishing industry, should have known how difficult it would be and how unlikely it was that those conditions could ever be enforced by the available patrol boats. Let me once again draw attention to the theory of Dr. Lochner in connection with this fishing industry. I am merely drawing attention to this theory because, rightly or wrongly, this man correctly predicted, two years in succession, what the position would be, and I must draw attention to the fact that even after the curbs which have now been made, we are still going to allow larger quantities of fish to be exploited than those recommended by Dr. Lochner. According to him this is the critical year. If things should go wrong this year, we could possibly deal that fishing industry a blow which would have the result that it would take years before it would be able to recover.</p>

<p>Then there is the main charge which I brought, and I think the discussions have, to a greater extent than has ever been the case before, undoubtedly revealed this Government&#x2019;s incompetence and the absence of a realistic, constructive policy with regard to economic affairs. To reiterate, our main charge was that the cost of living was high, that it was a burden on the ordinary man and, in particular, those people who have a low income, i.e. the majority of the population of South Africa. We attacked the Government and accused it of being responsible for this heavy burden as its policy over the years had been aimed at limiting even further that factor which was the very cause of the rise in costs, i.e. labour. It was not necessary to look far for proof to substantiate our arguments. There were company reports. There were meetings held by trade and industry. There were complaints from individual businessmen who furnished the proof; every day the columns of the newspapers contained many complaints. I want to say that in my opinion it is ridiculous to restrict labour in a country blessed with as many privileges as South Africa has, and our speakers had no difficulty in proving that inflation in South Africa, although it has been occurring in other countries as well, was by no means due to the same causes in South Africa than in those other countries. The main causes of inflation in South Africa, I think, are of a local nature. There were the curbs on labour and the Government&#x2019;s monetary and fiscal policy. There were delay and incompetency on the part of the Government, and there was an inadequate infra-structure, which landed us in certain difficulties. But what was the answer we received&#x003F; Protestations from the side of the Nationalist Party that they knew the people much better than we did, and that we had fabricated our examples of hardships. But, Sir, let them continue in this way. It is certainly not my job to keep them in power, but I want to say that they are underestimating the intelligence of the people of South Africa, and they are underestimating it very badly. But that is their affair. If the Minister of Economic Affairs believes that people are not entitled to a better standard of living so as to share in that way in the wonderful rate of growth about which they are always boasting, it is his affair and not mine. But I and every one on this side of the House believe that all members of the population are entitled to look forward to ever-improving standards of living, which means that they will be able to buy more goods, live better and still save something. What can the people budget for under this Government&#x003F; They can in fact budget for rising wages and salaries, which, what is more, will buy less and less and will cause the value of the little bit they are still <span class="col_399-400" refersTo="page_0213"/>able to save to be worth less and less in those times when they will really need it. I think nothing has revealed the Government&#x2019;s heart more clearly than the provocative remark the Minister of Economic Affairs snarled at me. I, he alleged highly indignant, had said that we should create more employment opportunities, and I allegedly said this after I had been complaining about the very labour shortage that existed. Let us now get the facts straight once and for all. In the first place, there is a labour shortage, and that labour shortage is purely the result of the restrictive policy of this Government. In the second place, there is the fact that there are millions of people in South Africa who are unemployed or under-productive, poor people who are in desperate need of employment. In the third place, if we utilize that labour with wisdom, initiative and drive, we shall have a country capable of providing prosperity and strength and security and satisfaction to all its people. In the long run the most important struggle will be between the haves and the have nots. This will be the struggle which will determine the destiny of nations and people. I do not have the slightest doubt about this. But the vision of creating more employment opportunities so as to enhance the economic security of all of us, does not form part of the political equipment of this Cabinet. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, what does he say&#x003F; One may just as well say that one is trying to fly higher than one&#x2019;s wings can carry one. I agree wholeheartedly, Sir. The Government is incapable of flying any higher, because their policy has clipped their wings. I think I should like to write a new motto for them for the consideration of their new publicity officer, i.e. &#x201C;Fly Nat and fly low&#x201D;. For you see, Sir, they taught the people to spend for prosperity and then again to save for prosperity, and now it is, &#x201C;Vote Nat for Adversity&#x201D;. This is the choice before the people. Under the policy of this Government our growth has to be restricted, and I accept their arguments without hesitation. As long as they remain in power and their policy dominates South Africa, we shall be obliged to spend less and we shall have to be satisfied with higher taxes and rising prices. If we are to accept that nothing can be done about the labour shortage, how much the greater is the responsibility of this Government and how much the more is their guilt&#x003F; For is it not this Government that put an end to immigration in the late forties because of their narrow-mindedness&#x003F; They did so with a reckless disregard for the consequences, a permanent feature of this Government when one has regard to what is happening to the fishing industry at present. I should have thought that it was one of the primary tasks of a government today to keep a watchful eye on the increases in salaries and wages in relation to the increases in productivity. The Minister admits that there has in fact been a decrease in productivity at a certain stage, because of an increased demand for labour. If a labour shortage gives rise to disproportionate salary and wage increases, then the time has arrived for the Government to reconsider its restrictive policy. But what has the Government done&#x003F; It has done nothing, Sir. They are now trying to hide behind the argument that there was a shortage of capital, particularly in those years when we had a more rapid rate of growth, which was impeded by artificially created labour shortages. Sir, there is no shortage of capital. As a witness to this, I bring Mr. Dickman, the financial adviser to Union Acceptances. The following is what he told the annual congress of the Association of Chambers of Commerce&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite the relatively greater availability of money in comparison with three years ago, a diminution of faith in equities has put dividend yields higher.</block>

<p>I emphasize the words &#x201C;despite the relatively greater availability of money&#x201D;. You see, Mr. Speaker, the labour policy holds the key to the solution of South Africa&#x2019;s economic problems. I think this is an irrefutable and indisputable fact, but today we find ourselves in the tragic situation that the Government&#x2019;s labour policy, which at the time they launched with all the fervour of their racist labour enthusiasm, has run into a stone wall. The impact knocked them over completely. No-one knew in what direction he had to go. Eventually some of them realized that the provision of employment to greater numbers of non-Whites was absolutely inevitable. Now, however, we have the pathetic picture of the Minister of Planning, who says that he wants to employ more Coloureds in the motorcar industry, but that the trade unions do not want to allow that. You know, Sir, history is a hard and a merciless taskmaster. It is that racist indoctrination on which the Nationalist Party has fattened itself which is creating the problems with which <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0214"/>this Government and this Minister are faced today.</p>

<p>What other complaints are there&#x003F; The Minister of Economic Affairs complained that I should like to have an unrestricted influx of unskilled Bantu. That, of course, is not true, Sir. At one time we thought we knew what the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s policy was, i.e. the reservation of specific jobs for Whites and a prohibition on the employment of Bantu in certain spheres. Of course, the emphasis was on &#x201C;restriction&#x201D;, that is true, but the facts we definitely mentioned year after year as well as during the debate this week, proved beyond any doubt that the attempts of the Government to give content to this policy had failed altogether. In spite of that policy, the number of Bantu employed in the manufacturing industry has increased tremendously.</p>

<p>The policy of my party is available to all who want to read and study it. In short, it means the provision of labour which will be adequate to meet the demands of a growing economy, which will definitely result in the use of more non-White labour and in more productive work, but the policy also makes it clear beyond any doubt that no White person will suffer because of the steps we shall take. All race groups, White and non-White, from whose ranks our labour is drawn, must be assured of an improvement in their present standard of living. To me the policy of this Government seems to be aimed at the exact opposite. On paper they are restricting the influx of Bantu labour to the White industrial areas, but the truth is that that influx is continuing at an unprecedented rate. For the situation which arises because of this influx, they have no plan or policy. For many years and to this day they have been ridiculing that well-established and tested weapon, i.e. &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;. If the hon. the Minister of Transport will cast his mind back, he will remember that he virtually rejected this old weapon in the forties. The trade unions did not agree with him, but as far as he was concerned, they could go to the devil. And now that the Government has to cope with this gigantic problem of the urban and urbanized Bantu, it has only one solution. This is the solution which was explained to us by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. He told us that because of the continued influx of Bantu labour, the Government had decided to move industries to the border areas. What kind of solution is that&#x003F; The Government is jumping from the frying pan into the fire. It is not solving one single problem by moving these industries.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Instead of one, they are creating a thousand. This is not decentralization for economic reasons. This is decentralization for ideological reasons, and the hon. the Minister knows this.</p>

<p>Now, what are the facts&#x003F; Firstly, the border areas are still White areas. Secondly, whereas four Bantu were employed for every White person before the industries were moved, approximately ten Bantu are employed for every White person in the border areas. Thirdly, these ten Bantu will now do more and more work previously done by Whites in those areas. Fourthly, those ten Bantu are now working for a fraction of the wages of the Whites whose work they are doing in those areas. This state of affairs has arisen without proper consultation with the trade unions, the watchdog of the worker, and without any advance planning as regards the pattern this development was to take. I have said and explained enough about the risks this policy holds for the White worker. Therefore, the truth is that White manpower is the victim of the Government&#x2019;s ideological obsessions. Like sensible people, the Whites are not simply opposed to change as such. What they object to, is uncontrolled change which can lead to confusion and uncertainty.</p>

<p>The Trade Union Council of South Africa recently made certain proposals to the Planning Council of the hon. the Prime Minister. The central theme of their proposals was concern about the confusion and uncertainty caused by the official labour policy. That is the labour policy of this Government, which is powerless to control the present influx of non-White labour to our industries and which is creating conditions rendering the position of the worker uncertain and causing him to fear for his future.</p>

<p>Now I want to refer to certain comments made by the hon. the Minister of Planning, who does not believe that increased production can combat inflation. His example as regards the increase in the <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0215"/>production of goods and services as an answer&#x2014;I quote what the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;is virtually &#x201C;unjustifiably lighthearted&#x201D;. In a serious situation it puzzles me what particular economic principles he wanted to illustrate. The hon. the Minister said the position was the same as that of a husband and a wife, where the husband earned R300 per month and the wife spent the entire R300 while one or two accounts remained outstanding. This man studied further and obtained a degree. Through very hard work he eventually earned R600 per month. Despite that the wife still spent that R600 per month and accounts were still outstanding at large fashionable stores. What exactly does this example prove as regards the basic problem of how to produce goods and services more effectively and on a larger scale&#x003F; A society which does not have a hope of doing this and which does not at least have this idea as the underlying idea and main objective of its economy, may as well throw in the towel. What the comparison drawn by the hon. the Minister does illustrate, is something else. It is something which comes very near to precisely what has been happening under the present Government. It is a case of a person who earns R300 per month in a certain year, R600 a few years later and still has to spend the full amount of R600 in order to keep his head above water. This is what he was illustrating.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what we are objecting to, is, now that restriction has become necessary because of the Government&#x2019;s policy, that the Government is imposing that restriction without its putting into operation at the same time, as a matter of urgency, a plan of action for combatting by these means further inflation in the future. Surely, the restrictions must have a purpose. They should not merely erase symptoms, but must be followed by steps to remove the root causes of inflation. One of the fundamental causes of inflation is that too much money is chasing too few goods. Another cause is that too few people are filling too many positions in order to provide the required goods and services. Both causes hold good for South Africa. Unless the South African businessman is sure that these restrictions are no more than short-term steps being taken while the Government is engaged in overhauling the economic machine for the next climb up the hill of growth, the effect of these steps will be virtually destructive. I have no expectation whatsoever that the action taken by this Government is properly focused and that its short-term bungling will be replaced by long-term planning. Unless the Government creates the right climate for higher production and until such time as it devotes its attention to the fundamental principles of growth, this country has one prospect only, and that is one economic pitfall after the other and a South African economy which in the near future, judged by world standards, will look like a Tin Lizzie in the Kyalami motor-car races.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The accusation of the other side has been that there is no wasteful expenditure by this Government. One can have a long session of ridicule against the Government on this score quoting one example of wasteful expenditure after another. One could tell of ministerial trips overseas so extravagant that they left this House breathless when they were exposed. There is the story of the bridge that the Railways built at Bethulie without checking up whether it would be under water as the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam was built. I believe that that piece of administrative genius cost the country about R2 million. Then there is the Agliotti affair, where R5 million too much was paid for a piece of land and they might have lost all of it, had it not been for the vigilance of the Press. One could ask how much manpower and money it cost to open 3&#x00BD; million letters to look for lottery tickets. One could ask how much of the R400,000 spent annually on commissions, is money well spent when one knows that the Press Commission sat for 13 years and produced a dead duck. I could refer to the many hundreds of thousands of rand spent on elaborate homes for the commissioners of the Bantustans. One could talk of the millions of rand spent on rehousing people and pushing them around, when they already had accommodation but not in the right places.</p>

<p>I think it is much more important to house everybody well, than to push people about from one area to another. All the hon. Minister wants to do is draw another red herring. He knows very well indeed that he is having to move nearly half a million people under the Group Areas Act. One could examine how much is wasted in elaborate Government publications which nobody reads. There is a population register in Pretoria, established at tremendous expense, which the Government now wants to replace with a new type of register. The other is no good any more. I could turn to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report and read about new towns standing empty in the Bantu areas or I could quote revelations about expensive machinery rusting away in those territories.</p>

<p>The list is endless and I have not even referred to the Transvaal Provincial Council yet and what is happening over there or to the many duplications which there are. I do not think it is right that one&#x2019;s criticism of wasteful expenditure should be limited to particular examples, no matter how much they abound. I think one&#x2019;s criticism is directed to the fact that under this Government the very process and spirit of government is wasteful. We have now debated for days how this Government is wasteful of our human resources because it will not use the manpower we have to produce the wealth we can have. Almost everything this Government does is intended to curb and to restrict the enterprise of our people. One thinks about this Physical Planning Act and about the manner in which influx control is administered, keeping half a million persons in prison for offences under the pass laws. These can be gainfully occupied elsewhere, instead of being a burden on the State&#x2019;s shoulders.</p>

<p>Our cities are strangled, our platteland is neglected, the border areas have developed patchily and without future regard to the Bantu of these Bantustans. The entrepreneurs, the housewives, the citizens &#x2014;all of them are enmeshed in a legislative red tape of ideological interference into other people&#x2019;s lives. Hon. members do not have to ask me where this Government wastes money. I believe this Government is a waste of South Africa&#x2019;s precious time and a waste of South Africa&#x2019;s wonderful opportunities. While it lasts, South Africa is held back and the people&#x2019;s progress is retarded. Only when it goes, South Africa will be taken off the lead. This Government is always looking for trouble. It wants to know from us how we will negotiate with the trade unions to get them to agree to change the labour pattern. They seem to regard this as well-nigh an insuperable problem. I believe it must be from their point of view, because they approach the question negatively, ridden with prejudice, facing the needless fears that their own propaganda has created for them. With every concession they ask for from the White worker, they ask knowing that their asking is a denial and a negation of their own bigoted attitude and their own policy. We would depart from entirely different premises in these negotiations&#x2014;something which no dyed-in-the-wool Nationalist could understand or appreciate.</p>

<p>We would approach the problem in the spirit of high adventure, as a grand challenge to Government and people in South Africa to scale new heights of achievement. When we negotiate with trade unions, we will not ask them to do things that we ourselves fear and distrust. We shall approach them with confidence, knowing that what we ask is right and just and necessary in the interest of all concerned, especially the members of the trade unions concerned. In these negotiations I am satisfied we shall have certain built-in advantages which are not available to the present Government because its outlook is wrong. There is an example that we South Africans have of the advantages of calm and intelligent negotiation, collective bargaining, under the Industrial Concilliation Act which the wisdom of Gen. Smuts gave to South Africa in the past.</p>

<p>Our industrial leaders, from the employers and from the workers, know and understand the working of this great charter of free negotiations. Our permanent administrators in the departments concerned are highly experienced and understanding in dealing with just these things. I believe that in a new spirit of positive achievement, instead of the negative restrictive thinking of this Government, their skill and their experience will have a scope they are not permitted today. There is another example of the willingness of intelligent workers and the leaders of their organizations to co-operate in this changing labour pattern. That is the example I have already given, namely the offer made by the Trade Union Council of South Africa to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Advisory Council for a bold plan for creating machinery at a <span class="col_407-408" refersTo="page_0217"/>national level for the smooth working of this new phase of collective bargaining. The plan goes further. It shows how this national organization can be supported at the level of the industrial councils in particular industries and in particular undertakings. I believe, with the understanding and the co-operation of trade unions at that time, changes in our labour pattern could be brought about in many spheres of South Africa&#x2019;s industrial life. I believe workers would then see in practice how the White workers&#x2019; interests can be protected and furthered by such changes. They will note how great the progress in such industries and such undertakings could be. I believe they will bring pressure to bear on their trade union leaders and their political leaders to let them share in the advantages which the new South Africa could bring to its people. I know my friends opposite have difficulty in sharing this vision with us, but their blindness will not deter us. We will encourage the people to make use of the resources providence has granted our country and which I believe can lead South Africa into the greatness which her people can earn for her.</p>

<p>Now, how do we see the future as opposed to the way in which this Government is seeing it&#x003F; I believe this Government has been in power too long. I believe its period has covered and closed an epoch. Its purpose has been served. It seems to me it is now fumbling along enmeshed in the toils of policies that cannot in any respect match the brilliance of the future that should be available to South Africa. We on this side of the House would like to take a fresh look at South Africa, to take a fresh look at its water resources, its mineral wealth, its agricultural potential and its productive capacity. We wish to ask ourselves how should we plan to put all this to work with the only purpose for which we have it in our care, namely the wellbeing of all the people who inhabit this country. We accept quite unabashed the accusation of the hon. the Minister of Planning that our ideal is a high level of economic growth. It is, because I believe one can teach the virtues of a civilized and moral life far easier to people who have a full stomach and a decent house to live in and decent clothes to wear, than one can to the poor people whose entire attention is taken up with getting enough food to eat and getting enough clothes to keep the cold out in winter. I believe that a rich South Africa could afford far, far better to provide fair and decent amenities for all our race groups and to provide just race policies for all our people than could a poor South Africa. Therefore I have no hesitation in saying, although the hon. the Prime Minister will accuse me of cynical materialism, that when we look at the map of South Africa, we put its economic wealth in the forefront of our aims.</p>

<p>Let us also take a fresh look at the White people of South Africa, because we want to see them secure and once more sure of their purpose and firmly set on a course to ensure the very best use being made of their undeniable talents for leadership and their ability to take advantage of greater opportunities. What possible fears can South Africans have of this policy of ours when job opportunities will probably expand faster than the numbers of the people will multiply&#x003F; I think we would also like to take another look at the Coloured people. We would like to see the end to the alienation of the Coloured people. We would like to see the squalor in which many of the Coloured people live today, tackled in the same way that the poor white problem was tackled nearly 40 years ago by economic upliftment, better education and better living standards.</p>

<p>I believe we should take a fresh look at the Bantu people of this country, viewing them less as a problem and more as the great asset they undoubtedly are for the economy of South Africa. We will look to the needs of the Bantu as well, their very basic needs in the urban areas where they live and work. In fulfilling their needs, I believe, we will be fulfilling our basic needs as well, the need for security and peace of mind for the White population. I have no doubt that the greatest sociological problem in South Africa today is the problem of the urban Bantu. They will never, not even under the restrictive policies of this Government, disappear from our urban areas. But under these restrictive policies there is a danger that he can become not a powder keg, but an atomic bomb which no party will be able to handle. I believe that that situation has to be stopped immediately. We are agreed on the principle of the development of the homelands even if we are not agreed about their political future, but when it comes to the treatment of the urban Bantu we on this side of the House and those on the Government side are poles apart. We believe in first things first. We believe we have to accept the urban Bantu as <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0218"/>something permanent, permanent residents in their own separate residential areas, with their own schools and their own adequate social amenities. We say that he must be given back his self-respect and recreate the trust he had for the White man in the past; he must be given the comfort and security of a decent standard of living, a safe and secure home and the dignity of undisturbed family life. Is it possible that in this day and age we should be pleading for those things for people who are citizens of our country&#x003F;</p>

<p>We on this side of the House accept&#x2014;I should go further and say we demand&#x2014; that greater and better use should be made of all our labour in South Africa, also of our non-White labour. This will lead to more Bantu in our factories and in our places of work of many descriptions, but under our policy it will mean something different from what it means under the policy of the Government. It will mean that they are not there illegally and not there under the lap, insidiously and dangerously undermining the firm and orderly control of the trade unions, employers&#x2019; unions and Government agencies that should have control over labour in this country. Under our policy they will be employed in industry openly; their presence will be open to proper trade union scrutiny. Their rate of increase, their training and their contributions will be properly planned and controlled to meet the demands of industry and the country&#x2019;s greater growth. Our policy also makes provision for the study of labour problems and requirements at national level, for authoritative opinion and advice to reach the proper quarters and consultation at all levels. Our policy demands that the interests of the White worker be safeguarded and that his voice be heard at all times. We feel confident, with the tremendous benefits that can accrue to South Africa and to them with the adjustment of this new labour pattern, that we shall get their help and their support. We are adamant, however, that there should not be bulldozing tactics and that agreement and consent should commence at the shop-floor level.</p>

<p>As I have said, our aim is maximum economic growth which we believe is essential for racial peace and harmony. What we would like to know at the present time, for example, is this: While the consumer&#x2019;s spending power is being restricted and monetary restraints applied, are there people behind doors planning for South Africa&#x2019;s next big leap forward, who are planning not within the confines of the Government&#x2019;s restrictive race policies but who are looking at the map of South Africa as the United Party looks at it with its yet untapped sources of natural wealth ready to work for the welfare of South Africa when our country&#x2019;s dynamo of manpower has been unleashed to work for the country as well. I believe it is only when we can think with some clarity along those terms that we can see the real future potential of South Africa. With the manpower available to us we should be able to set about improving the infrastructure that exists today, building the railways, the ports, the roads, the power lines and the communications that are essential for a greater rate of growth in this country.</p>

<p>I have little fear that capital will be a problem. Under the right policy South Africa is one of the most attractive areas of investment for capital anywhere in the world. I believe that if hon. members opposite have doubts as to the availability of capital, it is only because they foresee difficulties that their policies are making for South Africa. Once you have the right climate the king pin in the economy becomes the private investor. What he needs most at the moment is confidence. Here I want to repeat what the hon. member for Parktown said.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<block name="quote">What they need is confidence that we are going places, confidence that we are getting on top of our problems, confidence that we are poised for further growth, confidence in the wealth of our export potential, confidence in our own ability to succeed, confidence that the Government will provide the right climate.</block>

<p>I want to challenge the Minister of Economic Affairs. Let him stand before any group of businessmen in this country and ask them whether they are confident that this Government is getting on top of its problems. Are they confident that we are ready at the starters&#x2019; post for the next big leap forward in our growth and our economy&#x003F; Are they confident that we can earn really big money by the export of our tremendous mineral wealth, and are we competent to exploit that potential&#x003F; Are they confident that the Government and this Cabinet really know what the future <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0219"/>of South Africa is going to be and are confident about it&#x003F; I will tell you what the answer will be before any group of intelligent businessmen in South Africa. I will tell you what the answer of the country will be as well. It is going to a very, very loud shout of &#x201C;No!&#x201D;. It is going to be one unanimous, concerted shout. That is one of the main reasons for our motion of no confidence in this Government. It is that their restrictive policies, their fumbling and indecisive leadership have damaged the economy and undermined confidence in the future.</p>

<p>Inflation, with its concomitant high costs and heavy burdens upon the people, have become endemic under this Government. We run the risk that the rate of inflation may outpace the rate of growth, with disastrous results for South Africa. There is only one cure, I believe, Sir, and that is to do as I ask and get rid of this Government.</p>

<p>Motion put and the House divided:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>This Bill is relatively simple and in fact self-explanatory; consequently I will not deal with it at length. The main object of this Bill is to provide for the appointment of a vice-rector in order, by so doing, to furnish assistance to the rector.</p>

<p>A rector of a Bantu university, such as the University of Fort Hare, has a very responsible and often unenviable task. In addition to such duties as are laid down by rules and which are possibly more or less the same as those of the rector of a White university, there are many others which arise firm the particular situation obtaining at a Bantu university and which in certain respects differ greatly from those at White universities. All these duties together sometimes result in unfair and exacting demands being imposed on the rector. Public relations, even in cases where there is a department of development, form an important part of the work of a rector, in fact, of all rectors. The task of the head of a White university in this respect is, however, limited to the White community. At a Bantu university, on the other hand, it is essential that there should be liaison with both the White and the Bantu communities.</p>

<p>In addition, regard must be had to the fact that the Bantu universities form an important part of the implementation of State policy, which necessitates continuous liaison and contact with the Government departments concerned and with departments in the Bantu homelands themselves. These essential duties, which often involve being absent from the university, can be carried out properly and satisfactorily only if there is a person who can ensure that continuity in the internal activities is not interrupted by absence. Experience has definitely shown that continuity and consistency in action and in the implementation of many important aspects of policy are impaired if work to be done by substitutes is dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. As regards the liaison with students, too, the set-up at Bantu universities differs considerably from that at White universities, and very heavy demands are made on the time of the rector of a Bantu university. The rector&#x2019;s success in being accepted as a leader by the students is in a special sense determined by his relationship with them. Practice has shown that on account of the Bantu&#x2019;s outlook on certain matters, the problems and needs of individuals or groups of students cannot be dealt with satisfactorily on the clerical or even on a considerably higher administrative level. The Bantu student wants his case to be heard by the highest authority and the students want to present their cases to the rector himself or to someone very close to him. This is in fact what his deputies will be. This unavoidable responsibility, however, imposes a burden on the rector and makes it difficult for him to fulfil his statutory obligations. Because the external responsibilities and duties of the rector of a Bantu university are greater and more extensive than those of his counterpart at a White university, it follows automatically that his burden as regards internal responsibilities should be eased as far as possible and that unfair demands should not be made of him. The rector has a special duty in regard to planning, that is to say, academic, administrative and structural planning. Here, again, planning is linked with departmental co-operation <span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0221"/>and approval, which means that committee work alone becomes an almost full-time job. Rectorial assistance will be able to make a great contribution in this respect.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the vice-rector, like the rector and other professors, will form part of the constitution of the university.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of this hon. House to the following clauses in particular:</p>

<p>Clause 2: This clause governs the appointment, conditions of service, powers, privileges, duties and functions of the proposed vice-rector. It also provides that the rector may delegate some of his powers to the vice-rector, but without the rector, who is the chief executive officer of the university, being divested of such powers.</p>

<p>Clauses 3 and 4: Here it is proposed that the vice-rector shall be a member of both the council and the senate of the University. This arrangement will ensure the necessary continuity in the work. There is actually nothing more to be said about this Bill, and for the sake of expediting the business of the University of Fort Hare, I hope this will meet with general approval.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, approximately two years ago Fort Hare was given its constitution and we are now being asked to amend it. The Minister in motivating the second reading has referred to the duties of the rector. He says that they are onerous and that the rectors of these universities cannot be likened to the principals or rectors of White universities in that they have to have liaison not only with the Africans but with the White people as well and with Government departments. He says too that the students want to be in touch with the top official and if he is not available there must be somebody appointed in his place. He says that these are the reasons which necessitated the amendment. In 1969 when the principal Act was passed we were told that there were 426 students at Fort Hare and that there were 97 on the staff, that is to say, 4.5 students per member of the staff. If you took only matriculated students and not those who enrolled for diplomas there were three students to every member of the staff. The trend at that time was that the number of students was decreasing, and if this trend continued, then of course, there would be still fewer students per teacher. I would like the hon. the Minister in his reply to tell the House what the position is at the moment at Fort Hare. Has there been an increase in the number of enrolled students and what is the position with regard to the ratio of students to members of the staff&#x003F; If in fact the number of students has decreased or has not increased materially, it would seem that the number of students compared with staff is very small and there would not be the same necessity for the appointment of an extra administrative officer. I want to know why this post was not considered necessary when the principal Act was passed. There is the question too of additional costs because this officer will have to be paid. In 1969 when the principal measure was discussed, Mr. Moore then calculated that it was costing R2,600 per annum for a matriculated student at Fort Hare and R1,700 for a diploma student. Sir, that is many more times as much as the cost of educating a White student. The Minister, in the same debate, reduced the amount to R1,490 but that is still a high figure. We agree that the university must be properly run. The Minister may say now that without the assistance of an assistant or vice-rector the administration will suffer. We will have to agree to this appointment because of the representations made by him, but I want to ask him what about the University of Zululand and the University of the North&#x003F; I notice from the figures given by the Deputy Minister in 1969 that the candidates who received matriculation exemption in Zululand and decided &#x2026;</p>

<p>Order! That point is not under discussion.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the circumstances are the same. We have two other similar universities, and I want to know why, if it is necessary to appoint a vice-rector for this university, it is not necessary to appoint one for those two universities because their constitutions were all passed at the same time.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that there are more students in those areas qualifying for university entrance than there are at Fort Hare. Then too Fort Hare has had many more years of experience of running a university than those two universities, and if it is necessary to appoint an additional assistant to the rector, one would have thought that it would be more necessary at these other two universities than at Fort Hare. I ask the Minister why it is not <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0222"/>necessary to appoint an additional rector at those universities if it is so important to appoint one at this university. The vice-rector will be appointed by the council in terms of this Bill, with the approval of the Minister. Unfortunately the Minister appoints the council, so the vice-rector, we can take it, will be quite sure to be chosen by the Minister, and we can be pretty certain what his political persuasion is going to be. There is nothing in this Bill which prohibits the appointment of an African to that position, but bearing in mind the attitude of the hon. the Minister to Africans and Whites serving on the same council, it is a safe bet that the African will not be considered for appointment to this post. Sir, we do not contend that only an African should be appointed. There may not be a suitable one.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We do not say that only an African should be appointed. There may not be one suitable for the post, but we say that if there is a suitable applicant with the necessary qualifications available, he should be appointed. The Minister cannot tell us that there are no Africans who will be suitable for an appointment of this nature, because he will remember that in Fort Hare&#x2019;s heyday Prof. Matthews acted as the principal of that university. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is to appoint an African, if possible. The Minister asks why I raise this point. The point is that otherwise, how will they be trained to take over the administration of the university, which must ultimately happen if the Nationalist Party is sincere in its policy of separate development&#x003F;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is a sad fact that under the policy of this Government an African cannot advance to the top, or even to the second top position, in his own university and he is barred from the other universities. I want to know from the Minister, too, whether the Transkei Government and the Ciskeian Territorial Authority were consulted in this matter, and if so, what their reactions were. After all, this is a university which has to serve the people of those two authorities and I should like to know whether they were consulted on this issue.</p>

<p>*We voted against the principal Act when it was introduced here. We do not accept the main provisions of the Act, but in the interests of the Xhosa we must ensure that the administration of the university is as efficient as possible. Since the Minister has now explained to us that the appointment of the rector is necessary for the more efficient administration of the university, we will not stand in his way. We will not oppose the Bill, but I appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards the appointment of Bantu in this kind of post. This Government has so often changed its standpoint and policy and has made so many about-faces that they could easily do it in this case as well in the interests of both the White man and the Black man.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei did in fact say at the end of his speech that the United Party supports this Bill, but this was in fact an about-turn on their part. The support given by him was given in a very half-hearted way. He put a number of questions here the answers to which emerge very clearly from the Minister&#x2019;s speech and from the Bill itself, but what he actually intended doing was to make insinuations and sow suspicion. It was very clear from the entire spirit of this speech that this was a very halfhearted support of the Bill. In fact, the United Party has no record to be proud of as far as the history of the establishment and development of the universities for non-White ethnic groups is concerned.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. ENGELBRECHT</person>:</from>

<p>No, but I just want to remind the hon. members that they do not have a record to be proud of. But we are grateful to them now for giving their halfhearted support to this Bill. To me it is quite clear why the appointment of a vice-rector at this university has become necessary. The hon. member for Transkei asked why this was not initially introduced. It is very clear that it was not foreseen at that time. Now it has become clear that there is a great need for such an office. It can be argued on principle <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0223"/>whether a university has any need at all for a vice-rector. It is not for this House to decide the principle of the matter. Some of our large White universities have one or more vice-rectors, while others have none. The fact of the matter is that the council and the rector of the university of Fort Hare have felt the need for the appointment of a vice-rector here. That is why this Bill is before the House today. Apart from the reasons mentioned by the hon. the Minister, I can myself see other reasons for its being necessary. At present it is the case that an acting rector can be appointed by the Minister after consultation with the council. Now, it could happen that the rector suddenly falls ill or is called away and then the procedure for appointing an acting rector is not such an easy one. It is also the case that at present provision is not made, in the existing legislation, for a deputy chairman of the senate. With this legislation for the appointment of a vice-rector, such a person will also of course act as deputy chairman and as chairman of the senate in the absence of the rector. Similarly there are other reasons as well.</p>

<p>It is necessary to point out that the task resting on the shoulders of the rector of the University of Fort Hare is a major and important one. It is a difficult task because pioneering work is being done here and because this university must make provision for a great nation which is in its developing stages and has a great need for leaders. This nation must be provided with leaders. This is an ambitious task. That is why one is grateful for its now being possible for that rector to receive assistance from a vice-rector, who can then take over some of his tasks.</p>

<p>I find it a great pleasure to support this Bill since that university must also make its contribution, not only in carrying out its primary task of guiding, training and providing the Xhosa people with leaders, but also because it can make a contribution towards solving our complicated problems in this country, particularly in regard to our relationships problems among the various peoples. We believe that this amendment Bill which makes provision for the appointment of a vice-rector will also contribute towards this university in future being able to accomplish its task with greater distinction.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not intend opposing the Second Reading of this Bill. I must say I do not think all that much of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s explanation as to why it is necessary, so soon after the university had been given its full status, to have this new appointment. One of the reasons he gave was that the present rector has so much administrative work to do that it was necessary to appoint somebody else to have the personal contact with the students and to take this burden off his shoulders. The hon. member for Algoa simply said that it was now essential to have such a person. He did not give us any reasons at all why he thought this to be so. I wonder whether it is not a fact at Fort Hare, which has had a long and rather unhappy history of students&#x2019; unrest since it was set up, that one of the reasons has not been that there has been too much discipline imposed on students there. One of the conditions under which students are re-admitted at the beginning of the academic year, are that they must give an undertaking that they will devote themselves entirely to their studies and play no part in any activities outside purely academic work. All these, of course, are factors which might have added to the difficulties of the rector and it might well be that the hon. the Minister feels that he needs an additional disciplinarian to take charge of the students themselves.</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is true that at the University of Fort Hare students have to sign exactly the same undertaking that the students of the University of the North have to sign. However, I can only say that this is treating university students not even like school children, but on an even lower basis. These students have to sign an undertaking that they will devote themselves only to their studies and that they will participate in no extra-mural activities. They are told that if they do in any way occupy themselves with any activities outside of their academic work and purely university activities, they will be sent down and will not be re-admitted. I should like to know what White university would tolerate conditions like this for one moment. I hope that the hon. the Minister, when he replies to this debate, would give us some indication as to whether or not it is his intention, in appointing the vice-rector, to tighten up even further on these extra-academic student activities.</p>

<p>For the rest, i.e. the purely administrative side, I have no objection to the appointment of the vice-rector. But I do think that everybody in this House will scrutinize the activities at this university with some <span class="col_421-422" refersTo="page_0224"/>considerable care to make sure that the new appointment is not simply an additional disciplinarian at the University of Fort Hare.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, allow me first of all to assure the hon. member for Transkei that I appreciate the co-operation coming from the Opposition so soon in connection with a Bill from our department, the Department of Bantu Education. I think everyone will agree with me that it augurs well for this Session if the Opposition supports me with the first Bill with which I come to this House in the year 1971. As there are other Bills coming, I say, it augurs well for this Session. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the questions put to me by the hon. member for Transkei. His first question was in regard to the ratio between teaching staff and students. The position is that the number of students per staff member is increasing. There is a slight improvement in the figures of 1970 as compared to that of 1969. In 1969 the ratio was five students to one member of the teaching staff. This figure increased to 5.7 students per member of the teaching staff in the subsequent year. I cannot supply the figures for 1971 as yet, because, as the hon. member will know, students are at present enrolling. Further applications are still coming in. I was informed about a fortnight ago by the Rector of the University of Fort Hare, when he was here in Cape Town, that they received many more applications this year than last year. The tempo of new applications for 1971 increased as compared to that of 1970. I take it that there is a good possibility that the figures for 1971 will again be better than those of 1970. But as I said on this very same matter when we dealt with this Bill in this House two years ago, we must accept that in small universities you always get this phenomenon that the ratio of students to teaching staff members will be low in the initial period. You only get a better ratio in later years when the number of students has increased.</p>

<p>The next question was why we did not make such provision when we introduced a Bill two years ago to make provision for a separate Act for the University of Fort Hare. I can only say that this is a gradual process. We need not do everything which may become necessary in due course right at the outset. We tried to let the universities function without a rector and a vice-rector.</p>

<p>In the case of the University of Fort Hare, which is one of the older universities, it became necessary. After we have gone into the matter properly we found it justified. I was asked: What about the other two universities which were mentioned&#x003F; All I can say in regard to them is that so far it has not cropped up in their case. They have not yet considered asking for a vice-rector.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member asked me whether it would be possible for a Bantu person to advance&#x2014;that was the word he used&#x2014;to this post of vice-rector. My reply to that question is, with special stress on the word &#x201C;advance&#x201D;, yes. However, advance means starting from the bottom and progressing upwards. I wish to refer this hon. member to a certain section in the Transkei Constitution wherein we say that they should get their own people in their Civil Service, beginning from posts at the bottom advancing upwards to the higher posts. We also apply that principle with regard to the universities in the administrative as well as the teaching staffs. Then I may add, and that is in answer to a further question by the hon. member, that there are already 17 Bantu persons at Fort Hare at present who are lecturers, senior lecturers or professors. I do not have the figures available of the administrative posts, but I can assure the hon. member that there are already Bantu persons on the personnel of the Bantu universities. They are appointed wherever they can be appointed.</p>

<p>*The hon. member also asked me whether I had approached the authorities of the Ciskei and of the Transkei. The two Governments of the Ciskei and the Transkei are represented on the Advisory Council of the University of Fort Hare. The Advisory Council took part in the deliberations between the Council of the University and our Department. Through them there has therefore been contact with the authorities of the two territories. They also addressed a recommendation and a request to us in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me what the position is with regard to Bantu staff, but I have already replied to this. Then I want to thank the hon. member for Algoa for the assistance he gave me. Although we do not seem to need much assistance against our friends on the other side today, all assistance is welcome.</p>

<p><span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0225"/>&#x2020;Now I want to refer to the hon. member for Houghton. It is a pity that whenever the hon. member for Houghton has something to say in regard to Bantu Affairs, she always does so from the angle of the persons who always cause trouble and strife.</p>

As the vice-rector will be concerned with the rules of admission for students to the university, I can give the hon. member the assurance that all rules in regard to admission to universities and other matters of the universities, are matters which are considered by the council and the senate of every one of these universities as well as the rector and the vice-rector, for whom we are creating a post in the case of the University of Fort Hare, and I trust them fully in the handling of these matters. I do not want to say anything more in this regard and I think that should be ample assurance for the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>As a result of general expansion in the Department&#x2019;s activities and a rearrangement of administrative functions, it has become necessary to amend certain provisions of the Prisons Act, 1959. For example, it has come to light that the appointment and period of office of a member of a prison board was not defined clearly enough. Apart from this, no statutory provision existed for discharging a member of such a board if it were to appear during his period of office that he was no longer fit to hold office. In addition, the number of prisoners serving sentences of two years and more has increased to such an extent in recent years that it has become essential to decentralize prison boards and to ensure in that way that continuity is retained in respect of the prisoner and that individual treatment is applied more intensively. As a result of this, more chairmen have to be appointed, who, unfortunately, are not always available from the body of officers. On the other hand, there are a considerable number of nonofficial members of the boards who are in all respects fit to act as chairmen, chiefly because of their rich experience and worldly wisdom. The proposed amendment in clause 1 therefore seeks to:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) define the period of office and appointment of a member of a prison board more clearly, and also to grant the necessary sanction to discharge such a member in the event of his no longer being fit to hold office, and</li>

<li>(b) make it possible for non-official members of prison boards also to be appointed as chairmen of such boards.</li>

</ol>

<p>It has also become evident that it is merely a waste of time and manpower to approach the Public Service Commission in cases where members of the Prison Service are retained in service after they have attained the age of retirement of 60 years or in <span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0226"/>cases where members may be retired on pension on the attainment of the age of 50 years. In both cases the decision of the Public Service Commission is a mere formality because the Commission is not in a position to determine whether a member&#x2019;s services are necessary or superfluous, unless action is taken on the recommendation and motivation of the Commissioner of Prisons. The proposed amendment contained in clause 2 was discussed with all interested bodies and persons, including the Public Service Commission, which welcomes it, and this means that the Commissioner will now have the power to retain a member in service each year for a maximum period of three years after such a member has attained the age of 60 years, and to retire a member on pension after such a member has attained the age of 50 years.</p>

<p>It has also come to light that no prosecution can be instituted in terms of section 43 of the Prisons Act in cases where aid is given to a prisoner who escapes while he is on his way from one prison to another. The reason for this is that in terms of section 1 of the Act the existing definition of a &#x201C;prison&#x201D; does not include vehicles in which prisoners are transported. The proposed amendment contained in clause 3 seeks to remove this uncertainty.</p>

<p>It happens fairly often that persons, including and especially prisoners, divulge information about proposed escapes to the authorities, and because escapes and what they entail, involve the State in considerable expenditure and criticism, it is essential to make all possible attempts to combat them. As the position is at present, a reward may only be paid to a person who divulges information which may lead to and is instrumental in the arrest of an escaped prisoner. The proposed amendment contained in clause 4 will make it possible to pay compensation to informants who divulge information about planned escapes, and it will also serve as an incentive to bring planned escapes to the attention of the authorities without delay.</p>

<p>It has also become necessary to amend the punishments which are imposed on prisoners in respect of a contravention of the regulations. The proposed amendments contained in clause 5 (a) and (c) are merely grammatical and seek to eliminate any possibility of the proviso at the end of the subsection being overlooked. It has also become evident that the existing &#x201C;rice-water&#x201D; penal diet does not contain all the essential nutrients and that it may possibly be harmful to the prisoner&#x2019;s health. In consultation with the Department of Health, a substitute penal diet, which is more balanced and has more nutritional value for the prisoner, has been made up.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It does not taste as good.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. As the proposed amendment in clause 5 (b) now reads, only the maximum period which may be imposed will be prescribed by law&#x2014;this is as it appears in the Bill&#x2014; while the way in which solitary confinement with dietary punishment is served, will be prescribed by regulation. At present, however, the Act makes provision for the way in which the sentence is to be served, and because the proposal contained in clause 5 (b) is therefore incomplete in my opinion, I may just mention that I shall move an amendment in the Committee Stage so as to provide that the way in which the dietary punishment is to be served, will also be prescribed by law. However, before a prisoner is subjected to a dietary punishment, the health officer first has to certify that it is or will not be harmful to the prisoner&#x2019;s bodily or mental health. On the other hand, the automatic forfeiture of any remission of sentence is unreasonable and in reality a second sentence. It always involves a double punishment for the same offence, hence the proposed amendment contained in clause 5 (b).</p>

<p>As the position is at present, a prisoner may be freed on medical grounds if his life is endangered by further detention. In practice, however, it has been proved that district surgeons are hesitant to certify that continued detention in a prison is necessarily endangering a prisoner&#x2019;s life, in view of the fact that such a prisoner can receive the same, and sometimes better, medical treatment in the prison than outside. This has resulted in a great deal of obscurity, because what does happen, is that physically the prisoner is in fact no longer able to commit any further crimes, is virtually a permanently bed-ridden patient, can perform no work and consequently merely costs the State money. The proposed amendment contained in clause 6 seeks to eliminate this obscurity and to place the emphasis more specifically on his physical condition rather than on the danger which continued detention holds for <span class="col_427-428" refersTo="page_0227"/>his life. And now, Sir, I have explained most of the principles.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if ever there was an example of why it is sometimes necessary to have a White Paper printed together with the Bill, I think the hon. the Minister has demonstrated now that this is one such occasion. On the face of it, there are certain provisions of this Bill which, without any White Paper or other explanations, would seem objectionable. The hon. the Minister has motivated, for example, in regard to clause 1 the fact that, if in his opinion there are any good reasons to do so, a person appointed to a Prison Board can be dismissed from office during the course of the period for which he was appointed. A Prison Board, after all, only makes recommendations and does enquiries that the Commissioner wants them to do. They act purely in that capacity. On the face of it, this is a remarkable state of affairs. The hon. the Minister has indicated that this is now necessary in order to re-organize the question of Prison Boards. In the light of that, it is something at which we would now like to have another look and to discuss during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>But I think that, where there is a major administrative rearrangement of this sort about to take place, and a Bill is introduced to deal with it, hon. Ministers owe it to the members of this House to produce a White Paper, explaining just what it is all about.</p>

<p>So far as clause 2 is concerned, obviously this follows on the amendment of the Public Service Pensions Act in 1970.</p>

<p>So far as clauses 3 and 4 are concerned, we regard these as a great improvement as the Act does not deal with persons trying to aid prisoners who escape whilst in custody and being removed from one place to another. The commissioner ought to be able to offer a reward in respect of a planned escape as well.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, the Minister has indicated that he will introduce amendments during the Committee Stage. It is quite clear from what the hon. the Minister has said, that great reforms are taking place in respect of spare diet and reduced diet, neither of which appear in the proposed section but are already in the original Act. I hope the hon. the Minister in his reply will give us an indication of what is going to replace what was spare diet and what was reduced diet. If the Minister does that, it will aid us considerably when we consider this matter in the Committee Stage. <i>Prima facie</i> this provides that not a judicial officer but a commissioned officer of the prison should have an increased jurisdiction in respect of punishment from six days to thirty days in respect of solitary confinement with spare diet, where the Act lays down the manner in which spare diet shall be administered. The hon. the Minister is changing this with what is called &#x201C;dietary punishment&#x201D;. As the Minister indicated, there are going to be changes in respect of the sort of diet that is imposed which will not affect the health of prisoners. But we should like to have some details in this respect and we are very pleased that the Minister has stated that these matters must be prescribed by law and that he is going to move an amendment to that effect. I hope the hon. the Minister when he replies will give us an indication of what the changes are that are about to take place, particularly in so far as spare diet and reduced diet are concerned.</p>

<p>We do not oppose the Bill at this stage but propose to examine further during the Committee Stage in the light of the important disclosures which the hon. the Minister has made this afternoon.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>With reference to the principle contained in clause 1, the hon. member said that they would like an explanation in respect of the motive for the amendment. I think he will accept however, that since it is proposed to establish a more efficient system for dealing with prisoners, promoting a more efficient rehabilitation system, for example, what is stated here actually contains sufficient information to enable him, together with what he already ought to know, to endorse this amendment. Up to now we have had four prison boards. With a view to establishing a more efficient system, decentralization was then decided upon. In accordance with that principle, 22 such boards are functioning at present. In the course of a year a large number of cases come to the attention of these boards. For example, 41,867 such cases were investigated by those boards during the past financial year. As the hon. member knows, this is a case of prisoners sentenced to corrective training, from two to four years, for example, as well as prisoners who are generally serving sentences of longer than two years. The boards then issue a report about the adaptability, work capacity, gratuity and early discharge of <span class="col_429-430" refersTo="page_0228"/>these prisoners. It is therefore in the interest of the prisoners themselves that this amendment should be introduced.</p>

<p>Up to now an officer of the Prisons Service has acted as chairman of a prison board. This means that 22 such officers were involved in the activities of these boards on virtually a full-time basis, and they could consequently not perform their normal duties. Hence the amendment by which the Minister himself can, from time to time, designate a member of the prison board as chairman thereof. Such a person need not necessarily be an officer in the Prisons Service. This also creates the opportunity for the Minister to appoint persons who are not members of the Prisons Service, but who do nevertheless have expert knowledge about the rehabilitation of prisoners. Furthermore, here there is emphasis upon the ideal of concluding matters as speedily and efficiently as possible&#x2014;for example the power being granted to the Minister to discharge members of the board who have shown themselves to be incompetent.</p>

<p>As far as clauses 3 and 4 are concerned, it is very clear to me that these clauses are only aimed at the promotion of a more efficient prison system, while clause 5, read in conjunction with the regulations, very clearly emphasizes that the interests of the prisoners are still being taken care of. That is why the existing regulations make provision for a medical examination before a prisoner receives a reduced diet, for compulsory exercise to be given to such a prisoner and for prohibiting his having to work. For my part the amendment in clause 5 originates solely out of the necessity of not making it easier for a prisoner in solitary confinement; and yet it is made possible for him to endure it, and at the same time it contains the principle of deterrence for those who, as was the case in America, wanted to try to start a revolution. Since a different diet is prescribed for solitary confinement, one surely cannot expect that when such a prisoner is served with Provita and caviar he will still enjoy the same number of days of solitary confinement. Hence the increased number of days.</p>

<p>As a whole, therefore, this merely promotes the interests of prisoners, in my opinion, and serves as a deterrent at the same time. We on this side consequently support this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will know that I take a considerable interest in the prison system in this country and that I am in favour of all manner of prison reform so as to bring South Africa&#x2019;s prison system into line with the more modern practices in other countries. Certain improvements have certainly been introduced over the years, although I cannot say with any certainty that the administration inside the prisons has kept up with this spirit of reform which has been introduced by this hon. Minister and by the Commissioner of Prisons. This is something, Sir, which I will raise at a more opportune time.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned, I am not particularly concerned with Clause 1. The hon. member for Durban (North) has had some criticism to offer of the manner in which this has been presented. It is largely administrative as far as I am concerned and I am not particularly worried about it. Nor does Clause 2 worry me very much. I am not quite as sanguine as the hon. member for Durban (North) about Clauses 3 and 4. I realize that certain precautions have to be taken to give the authorities every aid in stopping escapes from prison. But Clause 4 rather worries me because I do not know just what care is going to be exercised in making quite sure that people are not encouraged to give information against other prisoners which may not be strictly accurate. It is very difficult to test the veracity of one man&#x2019;s statement in prison against that of another prisoner, and all sorts of petty vendettas develop when men are confined together in prison. I hope that the utmost caution will be exercised by the authorities in prisons to ensure that people are not informing against other prisoners simply to get them into trouble. It is not something that happens seldom under the prison system, not only in this country but everywhere else in the world. I do therefore have that precautionary note to sound on Clause 4.</p>

<p>Clause 5, which I think is the most important clause in this Bill, changes the penalties for contraventions of prison regulations by prisoners. I am worried about solitary confinement in an isolation cell which under existing regulations is limited to six days with spare diet and to 15 days without spare diet but with or without light labour.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I see it is going to be solitary confinement in an isolation cell for a period not exceeding thirty days. That is a very long period for solitary confinement. A lot of study has been done on the effects on prisoners of solitary confinement, and I am rather worried that this is now being extended from six days with spare diet and 15 days with a certain form of labour to a maximum of 30 days and dietary punishment for any one of the periods prescribed by regulation. The hon. the Minister did say that he was going to amend this. In other words, it is not going to be left to regulations; there is going to be something laid down in the law.</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear that. But I am still worried about the extension of solitary confinement to 30 days. That is a very heavy penalty indeed, and I do not believe that it should be extended to this lengthy period. With regard to the diet that the hon. the Minister talks about, I am glad to hear about the disappearance of this rice water diet which I think dates back to the early days of Union in South Africa, right to the very beginning. It is really a very outmoded form of punishment and I do not think that any modern penal system in the world uses rice water as a dietary punishment. Of course, rice water could only be given for a maximum of, I think, three days, and then there had to be one day of ordinary diet, then reverting again to three days on rice water. This new dietary punishment can now extend over the full period of thirty days&#x2019; solitary confinement.</p>

Now, the Minister told us that the new diet which is going to be worked out would be more nutritious and better for the prisoner than rice water.

<p>As I say, I am all for nutritious food being given to prisoners, but not in such a form as to make it completely inedible. I have those reservations about clause 5 and I am not saying now what I am going to do about clause 5, as I will decide in the Committee Stage whether I will vote for or against it, or whether I will move an amendment when I have seen what the Minister will put on the Order Paper by way of amendment. But I would like to say that I am glad about the amendment introduced in clause 6, which is certainly an improvement and affects the release of prisoners whose physical condition is such or, in the case of a woman, her advanced pregnancy is such, that early release and remission of sentence should be granted by the authorities. I am not going to oppose the Second Reading.</p>

<p>The hon. speaker who has just resumed her seat had problems with respect to clause 4, which provides that the Commissioner may pay monetary rewards to persons giving information relating to planned escape from custody by any prisoner. Her objection is that misuse could possibly be made of this concession by prisoners who have disputes among themselves. I can give her the assurance that the Commissioner of Prisons and his staff are most certainly ready for <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0230"/>this type of thing, and it ought to be very clear that misuse of this provision will not be allowed. I may point out&#x2014;it is interesting&#x2014;that in the Budget provision was also made for compensation that can be paid in terms of such a section, and that the total compensation provided for is a mere R500. That was the position in respect of the 1970-&#x2019;71 Budget.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, the question of solitary confinement, I should like to point out to the House that in the regulations of the Department adequate precautions are taken to ensure that people, for whom it would prove detrimental, are not locked up in isolation. That is why regulation 101 (2) provides that a prisoner shall not be subjected to solitary confinement with spare diet or reduced diet if the medical officer has certified that such solitary confinement and spare diet or reduced diet would be detrimental to such a prisoner&#x2019;s physical or mental health. Certain definitions here will, of course, now also have to change, but it is clear that a person will be medically examined before undergoing this punishment in accordance with the requirements laid down in the minimum standard regulations published by the United Nations and approved in Geneva in 1955; and in terms of regulation 101 (3) such a prisoner is visited each day in prison and is also medically examined. I may also point out that persons who have to serve this kind of punishment are allowed to do exercises every day. This requirement of exercise is also included in regulation 101 (4) of the Department. Under the circumstances it is very clear that sufficient precautions have been taken to ensure that only persons who can physically and mentally endure the punishment will have it imposed upon them. I do not think the hon. member for Houghton has reason for concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Durban (North) has indicated the attitude of those of us in the official Opposition, to the principal clauses which we have to deal with in this Bill. I should like merely to comment on two aspects of it, more particularly two aspects which were dealt with by the hon. member for Houghton. She dealt firstly with clause 4, where provision is made for a reward to be given to a person who gives information relating to a planned escape by any prisoner. The hon. member for Houghton felt that one must approach a clause of this kind with caution, because it might encourage prisoners to give information falsely against others in regard to a proposed escape. I do not share the apprehension on her part. Where people are incarcerated in a prison, there will always be those, whether one has provision for a monetary reward or not, who wish to curry favour with the warders and those in authority. It is inherent in the nature of such an institution that there is an inducement for persons who are prone to giving false information, to do so merely to improve their own position. That is inherent in the institution. In a prison that is properly administered by persons who have experience and know that this type of behaviour is prevalent, I do not think that we need be particularly concerned by a clause of this type.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, one must here hold a balance between two points of view. We are here dealing with a punishment which can be meted out to a prisoner for offending against the rules of the prison. One must approach this with a balance between two points of view. The one point of view is that we are dealing with a prison, not a five-star hotel. The point of view on the other end of the scale is that one simultaneously wants to be as humane in the administration in an institute of this kind as possible. Where the man or woman is there for the very purpose of suffering a punishment of incarceration, and that person nevertheless falls foul of the regulations, then that person can be punished in one of three ways, as I see it. Either you can inflict corporal punishment or confine that person to solitary confinement, or some type of dietary punishment can be imposed. I do not know of any other way in which a person can be punished, who is already subject to imprisonment as a punishment. The hon. member for Durban (North) raised the problems which the official Opposition has in regard to this provision. I do not think it serves any good purpose to enlarge at length on the goodness or badness of this particular clause, until we have heard what the hon. the Minister has to say in enlargement and amplification, not only of the amendments he proposes to introduce in this regard, but of the new approach that there is to the type of diet that is supplied to persons subjected to this form of punishment. Suffice to say then, Sir, that the matter can be dealt with properly and at length, <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0231"/>as the hon. member for Durban (North) said earlier, at the Committee Stage.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PRISONS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that the hon. member for Zululand replied to the hon. member for Houghton on the question of the encouragement of prisoners to inform against each other, or to get each other into trouble. It is a fact that the department is very mindful of that. These days it does happen that one prisoner ranges himself against another. The department is mindful of that. Where a real escape is being planned the officials of the department will be ready and waiting to see whether the information was correct or not. If nothing happens, it was wrong information. In reality it is a very simple matter. I am thankful to be able to say that it appears as if these measures are being generally well received with certain provisos.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to the hon. member for Durban (North) in connection with clause 1. In respect of clause 1 the department is actually saddled with a difficulty in more respects than one. In the first place, in the Act as it now stands provision is made for the appointment of board members. There is no provision for the retirement of board members if they were to become ill. In general we are dealing with oldish people. They are mostly pensioners, ex-officials of the department itself, ex-officials of the Department of Justice, ex-magistrates, etc. These are people who could easily reach a stage where they can no longer render service. That is the reason why we now want the power to be able to retire them as well. In the past we did not have this power. This clause therefore deals purely with administrative powers.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) indicated, we are decentralizing and therefore need more chairmen. There are not always sufficient chairmen available in the corps. Here and there we have many experienced and competent people who can be appointed as chairmen. That is why we want these powers. We decentralized because the boards, as they existed previously, could not continually remain in touch with their&#x2014;one could almost call them patients. As things now stand, with the larger centres throughout the country, the board members can continually remain in touch with the people. That is the whole intention of clause 1.</p>

<p>As far as I can remember nothing was said about clause 2. Clause 3 appears to meet with approval and I have already replied on clause 4.</p>

<p>As far as clause 5 is concerned, I can only say that one must go back to the existing Act and read them in conjunction. The existing Act lays down the length of dietary punishment. As the hon. member for Houghton indicated, this may not last for longer than six days. This period must also be interrupted by one day upon full diet. In the existing Act there is, however, no description of what the diet must be. It is only defined as a spare diet. I felt that it would be better if we also laid down, in the Act, what the diet should be. The existing Act, therefore, lays down the duration of the punishment and how it must be served, but there is no mention of what the diet must be. With this amendment I therefore want to adjust the Act in such a way that the duration is prescribed, that the manner of serving the punishment is also prescribed, and that the diet itself should be as prescribed in the regulations in the past. I may now tell hon. members who are interested that the present prescribed diet consists of eight ounces of rice water which is just boiled. The rice water is boiled in a certain quantity of water and then distributed in two portions, one in the morning and one at night. I concede that this is a very spare diet. In just a moment I shall state precisely what the diet&#x2019;s nutritional value is. The newly proposed diet will consist of seven ounces of properly cooked coarse mealie-meal, without salt, twice daily. It will therefore be a kind of porridge. Where a prisoner previously received eight ounces of rice water per day, he now gets 14 ounces of mealie-meal.</p>

I just want to compare the nutritional value of the two. I shall state the nutritional value of the old diet first and then compare it with the new diet. The old diet contained 824 calories as against 1,491 in the new diet. This means that there are nearly twice as many calories in the new diet. The old diet contained 15.3 grams of proteins by <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0232"/>comparison with 36.8 grams in the new diet. This means that there is more than twice the amount of protein in the new diet. The previous diet contained .9 grams of fat, as against 12.1 grams in the new diet. This means that there is almost 13 times as much fat in the new diet. The old diet contained 183.4 grams of carbohydrates, while the new diet contains 307 grams. The calcium content of the old diet was 24.4 milligrams as against 47.12 milligrams in the new diet. This means that there is almost twice as much calcium in the new diet. The old diet contained 213.3 milligrams of phosphorus as against the 770.4 in the new diet. The old diet contained 1.8 milligrams of iron by comparison with 9.45 milligrams in the new diet. The old diet contained no vitamin A, while the new diet contains 71.0 international units. The old diet contained .16 milligrams of thiamine as against 1.49 milligrams in the new diet. The amount of riboflavin&#x2014; something I myself use and pay a great deal for&#x2014;in the old diet was .07 milligrams as against .78 milligrams in the new diet. The old diet contained 3.6 milligrams of nicotinic acid as against 6.44 milligrams in the new diet. And finally, the old diet contained no vitamin C, as against 28.4 milligrams in the new diet. This means, in other words, that it is a very much better diet.</p>

For the next three days he will get a reduced diet which is half his normal diet. Thereafter he will be placed on full diet for two days, and then he will be placed on a spare diet again for three days.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as appears from the long title and clause 1 of this amending Bill, the proposed amendment is not really a complicated one, but because it has a history attached to it, I want to explain it in detail in order to obviate any possible misunderstanding which may arise. As hon. members are aware, the Second Schedule to the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, 1945 (Act No. 38 of 1945), contains a list of matters which may in terms of section 13 (1) of the Act be entrusted to a province by the State President by proclamation and with the concurrence of the executive committee of that province. The provinces are then authorized to legislate in respect of those matters. This list may be supplemented or amended at the request of the provinces.</p>

<p>In 1964 the province of Natal requested that it be entrusted with the establishment of and control over public resorts. The request was referred to the other provinces, which supported it. The matter was also referred to interested State Departments, and legislation was prepared to provide for the establishment of and control over public resorts being entrusted to provinces, by the insertion of a new paragraph 24 in the Second Schedule. The Department of Tourism, however, requested that the draft Bill be amended to ensure that the power and control to be obtained by the provincial authorities would be exercised only in consultation with the Department of Tourism, or that the exercise thereof would be subject to any standards or other requirements which that Department might impose in this connection. Subsequently, in September, 1966. the matter was discussed by the Minister of Planning, the Minister of Tourism and the Administrators. An amended draft was prepared and submitted to the provinces, which proposed further amendments, which were apparently acceptable to <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0233"/>all. At that stage it appeared that the matter had to a large extent crystallized out, and the amending legislation was then proceeded with and embodied in the Financial Relations Amendment Act, 1967 (Act No. 45 of 1967), as paragraph 24 of the Second Schedule.</p>

<p>Natal and Transvaal requested that, after the coming into operation of the said amending Act, a proclamation be issued, to make the relevant matter applicable in those provinces, and this was done. The Cape Province and the Orange Free State also asked for it initially, but before it could be arranged, they requested that it be cancelled after having heard of the problems which I shall mention further on. It is also unlikely that the latter two provinces will again apply for an entrustment of this nature as long as the present position continues. The problems to which I have referred, arose when Natal obtained a legal opinion from its own legal advisers, from which it appeared that as from the date of the promulgated entrustment to that province all regulations which had before that date existed with regard to public resorts would be invalid because they did not comply with the proviso to the statutory provision, namely that they should have been issued in consultation with the Departments of Tourism and Sport and Recreation. The matter was then referred to the Government Law Advisers, who initially agreed with the Natal legal advisers, but subsequently expressed the opinion that the regulations would remain valid until a court decided otherwise or until the issue was placed beyond all doubt by legislation. They also indicated that the State President was not authorized to withdraw the proclamations which entrusted the powers concerned to the provinces of Transvaal and Natal. The Cape Province and Natal in particular were strongly opposed to the request by the Department of Tourism to have a say in the framing of the regulations, which they regarded as a curtailment of the powers conferred upon them by section 13 (2) of the principal Act.</p>

<p>During discussions between the Minister of Tourism and the Administrators in Durban in September, 1969, the former intimated that he was prepared to recommend that the proviso be deleted. The four provinces in their turn undertook to consult with the Departments of Tourism and Sport and Recreation in all matters affecting the establishment of and control over public resorts. They should, however, not be restricted as is at present done by the proviso to paragraph 24 of the Second Schedule of the principal Act.</p>

<p>This is the position, and in the proposed amending Bill the matter is being rectified. This should give complete satisfaction. In the light of the outstanding and appreciated services rendered by the various provinces to the country in connection with the establishment and development of public holiday resorts and similar amenities, I am quite confident that this amending Bill will receive the support of both sides of this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, may I utilize this opportunity at the outset to congratulate the hon. the Minister on his appointment to his present position in the Cabinet and on his handling of this his first measure before this House. With that is also coupled our congratulations on his recovery in health. We hope that that recovery will continue and become better as time goes on. I am sure he will also appreciate that I do not couple with those hopes, the hope that he will be in office as Minister for a long period of time.</p>

<p>This measure before us, which the hon. the Minister lucidly explained to us, deals with provincial matters. It is also fitting that the hon. the Minister, having relinquished the post of Administrator in Natal, where he has been under the influence of a United Party Executive Committee, should in the first measure which he presents to this House, be restoring some powers which were taken away from the Provincial Councils. In this case it is the power of control of resorts, as the hon. the Minister has explained. It places unfettered control in the hands of the provinces, over and above the powers which they obviously exercise of consultation with the State Departments which might be concerned. In so far as we are expecting this to be a forerunner of similar thinking on the part of the Government under the guidance of the hon. the Minister, we welcome this measure and we will support it. We are able today, on the first occasion that the hon. the Minister is dealing with a matter under his portfolio, to discuss an issue with which we are in full agreement. No doubt, more contentious days between the hon. the Minister and myself lie ahead.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Although various sections of the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963, are involved in the proposed amendments, by and large only two matters are concerned here. In the first place, the position of Ministers, other than the Chief Minister, is being affected as far as their appointment and removal are concerned. At present the Chief Minister and the other Ministers are elected by secret ballot by the members of the Legislative Assembly from among their number. Now, however, the Legislative Assembly has requested the amendment of the Constitution Act so as to leave the appointment of Ministers in the hands of the leader of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly. The motive for the request is obvious, i.e. that the leader of the majority party, who will consequently be the Chief Minister in practice, will have to account to his people for his administration. Therefore he himself should choose the Ministers who are to assist him; otherwise the position may arise that the Legislative Assembly may elect one or two Ministers with whom the Chief Minister may not be able to get on and who may, in fact, not be at all favourably disposed towards him, while he, the Chief Minister, is held responsible for their actions.</p>

<p>Therefore clause 1 of the Bill seeks to amend section 12 of the Transkei Constitution Act so as to provide that whereas the Chief Minister will be elected by secret ballot, he is to appoint the other Ministers &#x2014;there are five altogether&#x2014;within seven days after his election. If, however, the Chief Minister wants to remove a Minister for reasons he regards as sound and cogent, he has to submit, in terms of the proposed new paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of section 20 of the Transkei Constitution Act, as contained in clause 7 of the Bill, a petition to the State President, who may if he deems fit, accede to any such petition.</p>

<p>These are the essential changes envisaged in respect of Ministers, and clauses 2. 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill merely provide for incidental matters. Hon. members will see from sub-section (2) of clause 1, however, that serving Ministers will continue to hold office as though they were appointed by the Chief Minister in terms of the new proposals.</p>

<p>The second matter which is being affected by the proposed amendments, is the question of chiefs in the Legislative Assembly. When the Transkei Constitution Act was promulgated in 1963, provision was merely made for general representation of paramount chiefs and chiefs in the Legislative Assembly, i.e. the four paramount chiefs and the sixty chiefs who held office in the various areas at that time. As a result of the increase in the number of chiefs in the various regions, the Constitution Act was amended in 1967 so as to provide that every district in which there were chiefs, would be represented by a prescribed number of chiefs and where there were more than the prescribed number of chiefs in any district, they had to hold an election among themselves in order to determine who would serve in the Legislative Assembly. At that time there were no chiefs in the district of Kentani, but in the meantime four chieftanships have been created in that district, and a request has been submitted by the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei for provision to be made to have Kentani represented by one chief in the Legislative Assembly. This means that the number of chiefs in the Legislative Assembly increases by one. This request is being carried into effect by means of the proposed amendments contained in clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the provisions governing the election and dismissal of members of the Executive, which term I prefer to &#x201C;Cabinet&#x201D;, could have been part of the United Party&#x2019;s proposed communal council under our race federation plan. I am talking about the provisions governing the election under the law as it stands at the present moment, although I do not say that they would necessarily have been so. I say that they could have been. This system of election as contained in the Transkei Constitution Act at present could have been part of our race federation plan. In principle, Sir, we had no objection to that form of selection of the Executive because it was giving the Assembly itself the right to select it. Then also the Executive could not be removed without the consent of the Assembly. We have an example of this form of government in our own institutions. The Executive Council of the Provincial Council for instance is elected by the members of the Council itself and the Executive members cannot be dismissed by the Administrator who is the equivalent of the Chief Minister of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Sir, the form of selection provided for in the Transkei Constitution was in fact the form which has become general in all our local bodies. City councils elect their committees and executives. The mayors do not choose them nor do they sack them. It was a form of selection which the country understood, and the Government itself must have thought that that method was proper and best when they passed the Transkei Constitution Act. Otherwise they would not have legislated in that manner. The then Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, told this House that the Transkei Territorial Authority had itself drafted the Constitution; that they had consulted with him and that he had approved of it. Therefore he must have considered that form of selection and dismissal advisable. Sir, when the Coloured Council constitution was passed by this House, provision was also made for the election of the Cabinet in the Coloured Council. I say therefore that this is a method which the country has come to accept.</p>

<p>The reasons which the hon. the Deputy Minister has given for wanting to make a change are not sufficient, I submit; they are not sufficient at all. The objections to the method which he mentioned today could have been thought of at the time. Why was provision specially made for election&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister now says that the Chief Minister must have a Cabinet consisting of members who are prepared to work with him, that he must not be embarrassed by them and that the Assembly may elect a Minister who is hostile towards the Chief Minister. Therefore the Chief Minister should be allowed to sack him. But, Sir, if the Assembly is run on a party basis, then surely the Chief Minister will have the majority of the members in the Assembly and they will elect the Ministers whom he chooses, as has in fact happened. If on the other hand the Assembly is not elected on a party basis and the Assembly chooses a Chief Minister and then chooses ministers to work with him, I submit it is only right that the Assembly should be able to dismiss a Minister of whom they disapprove. The Chief Minister should not have the right to dismiss a Minister chosen by the Assembly. It is only right that the Assembly should have the Ministers whom they have chosen because the Ministers are in fact the link between the Executive and the Assembly. We have a very shrewd idea, of course, why this amendment is being asked for now. It is because of certain difficulties being experienced between the present Chief Minister of the Transkei and one of his Ministers. But we do not think that a Constitution should be changed to solve the problems of a particular Minister. We will run into difficulties and endless troubles if we try to change the Constitution to meet the problems of various Chief Ministers.</p>

<p>Sir, section 11 of the Transkei Constitution Act provides that questions arising in the Cabinet shall be determined by a majority vote and a provision of this nature <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0236"/>is of no force and effect if a member knows that the Chief Minister can dismiss him if he disagrees with his point of view. I submit that this provision that differences of opinion in the Cabinet will be solved by voting will be of no force and effect because a Minister will know that if he disagrees with his Chief Minister he will simply be dismissed. To change the method of selecting the executive as is now proposed does of course fit into the Government&#x2019;s way of thinking. This is a natural course of political development towards complete and sovereign independence. This method of choosing and dismissing the executive is in line with constitutional development to sovereign independence, and as our party, and I am certain the majority of citizens of the country, are absolutely and unequivocally opposed to this idea of the Nationalist Party, we will not support any measure which may give the impression that the United Party is prepared to go along in that direction, and we shall vote against the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei made a long speech in connection with the historic background of the Transkei Constitution and in addition to that he indulged in much speculation as to what the underlying motive of this legislation was, and so forth. He tried to compare it with the provincial system. My attitude is that one cannot try to compare this legislation with the provincial system, because there is no comparison to be drawn, because the two cannot be compared and because no reconcilable comparison exists. When one says that a provincial council and the members of an executive committee are elected for a period of five years and that they cannot be dismissed by the Administrator or by anybody else, then it is a fact. To my mind we should rather view the development and the direction in the context of the self-government and the sovereignty mentioned by the hon. member. And that is what one is dealing with here and what one is going to deal with, is a self-governing, independent government in the Transkei; and the development there is more in the direction of a central government as we know in this House, too, and in terms of which it is the prerogative of the Prime Minister to constitute his Cabinet. For that reason I see that what is in fact happening here, is that this sovereignty the hon. member is talking about is developing and is taking shape. All that is at issue here, is the principle attached to the appointment and dismissal of their other Ministers. I think that the legislation as it stands, particularly in view of the fact that the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei has no objection to it, is the correct approach, that this will take them further along the road towards independent government and that what is being strived at here, is the modern democratic system of government.</p>

<p>I want to make the statement that a secret ballot of Cabinet members must definitely be an unsatisfactory thing for the Chief Minister in many respects because, in the first place, he finds himself in the position that he has inherited a Cabinet, a Cabinet which may, in his opinion, possibly be a great deal less effective, also bearing in mind that a party system may possibly develop there in due course. And, Mr. Speaker, I can imagine that at such a secret ballot the Chief Minister may be left with members of a Cabinet drawn from the ranks of the Opposition. I can image that we would have nothing but chaos if this should happen in this House. This is particularly the case in view of the present Opposition we are dealing with. I want to make the statement that the Chief Minister would like to make his appointments from the ranks of Ministers and people whom he can trust, people whom he, according to their capabilities, regards as suitable for the particular office and who will be able to give effect to those policies which he adheres to and is trying to implement. After all, he is the person who occupies the responsible position as head of that government and who is responsible to the country for all that has to be done.</p>

<p>There is only one aspect in clause 7 which is not quite clear to me. This clause lays down the manner in which the other Ministers may be appointed. They are appointed by the Chief Minister and the clause lays down the manner in which they will be dismissed. The position which may result from this, is that where a new Chief Minister is appointed, he may eventually be left with a Cabinet he did not appoint, a Cabinet he will be forced to retain for the duration of that Legislative Assembly. This may create an anomaly since a newly appointed Chief Minister will be at the head of a Cabinet the appointment of which he was neither accountable nor responsible for, but that he will nevertheless have to bear responsibility for the carrying into effect of all powers and all policies they may envisage in this connection.</p>

<p><span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0237"/>Otherwise I regard this legislation as being of a particularly progressive nature. I gladly give it my support.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, legislation dealing with the Transkei which we&#x2019;ve had from time to time in the past can be taken to deal with two aspects in connection with the development of that territory. One is the physical development, i.e. economic, agricultural, industrial development, and so forth. Generally it covers the broad lines of industrial development. The other is the political development. This Bill which we have in front of us today seems to me deals purely with political development. It is one of a number of measures which we&#x2019;ve had and no doubt it is one of a large number that we will still get. Probably in no sphere of legislation does the Government rely more on the philosophy of the inevitability of gradualness, as the old law has it, than it does in regard to these matters where the non-Whites are concerned. Here I think of the Group Areas Act and similar legislation which has been before this House year after year, involving little changes and steps in this direction, little changes made here and there, further little powers taken, and so forth.</p>

<p>I see this Bill as one within that pattern. It is political legislation in a pattern aimed, as the hon. member for Transkei said, at ultimately getting independence for sovereign Bantu states in South Africa, to which we are completely opposed. In passing, with particular relevance to the Bill we have before us, I would like to say that I have recently had a very interesting conversation with an hon. member on the other side, who has come back again to the old, time-honoured story that we should not be too concerned with this kind of thing because they were not going to give these states independence. That is non-sense. The time will come when it will be quite clear that the legislation is going in the direction of independence. That is the time when the rank and file of the members of Parliament on that side of the House will make their voices heard in no uncertain manner. I want to say that a lot of the words used at the present time are very misleading. We have so much terminology. We hear so many words about self-government. Self-government does not mean independence.</p>

<p>We hear about self-determination, for which I thank the hon. Chief Whip on the other side, and other terms. That does not mean independence. All these terms, somewhere or other, have their limitations. There is no dictionary of meanings to guide us in our debates on these measures. Various members use different words with their own private meanings, which mean what they want it to mean. It has the Alice in Wonderland touch about it. The hon. member who just sat down used language, which, if taken at face value, was clear in its implications that this Bill was a step in the direction of independence. He made that absolutely clear. The Deputy Minister did not do that. He is going along the line of gradualness, of little step by little step, but this is one of the little steps.</p>

<p>That, of course, is the hope of salvation for South Africa, of which, I am very pleased to say, the star is now rising brightly, namely, that, long before the penultimate end there will be the unqualified end of the Nationalist Government. That is the hope for South Africa.</p>

<p>With regard to this particular measure, we say that this is one of those small steps towards independence. This provision gives the Chief Minister of the Transkei the power to choose his own Cabinet Ministers, as my hon. friend over there called them, but he has not got the power to sack them. He has here been given the power <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0238"/>to hire but not to fire. When one thinks about that for a moment or two, it is very interesting because this measure is not a measure from the Transkei. May I say that we agree with my hon. friend from the Transkei. We have no doubt whatever that the Government is coming to the aid of the Chief Minister of the Transkei, who finds himself in difficulties with one of his own Cabinet Ministers. So he preaches what is a very good principle of legislation, namely that we should not pass legislation to meet hard cases. We should be very careful indeed when we do that. When we get the hard case here or there, we should be very careful about passing legislation to deal with that hard case. One may find another hard case that operates from another direction later on. Then what does one do&#x003F; Here we are then in the position that the Chief Minister by this Bill is given the power by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development to hire, but not to fire, his Cabinet Ministers. If, in terms of this Bill, the Chief Minister of the Transkei was to go to the Government, which would be the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, and say to him that he wants to fire Mr. XYZ, one of his Ministers, for such and such a purpose, the hon. the Minister for Bantu Administration and Development would be hard put to refuse that request. Indeed, Sir, this is one of the cases where the whip is being put in the hands of the Chief Minister of the Transkei, as it was under the legislation passed during the time of the late Dr. Verwoerd which dealt with educational matters. The hon. the Minister may think he is keeping the whip hand. But this is what we have warned him about from this side. Every time that the Chief Minister of the Transkei comes to him and wants to sack a Minister, the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development will not be able to resist that. He will have to agree. I repeat, he will have to agree. The law makes it look as though he has the right of veto. He does not have any choice in the matter. He will accept what the Chief Minister of the Transkei brings to him, because the Chief Minister then will have a vacancy and he will fill it by one of his own choice in the same way as the Prime Minister here in this Parliament will fill a vacancy in the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Let us recognize that this is the kernel of the matter that we have before us. Therefore we ask ourselves does this then stand alone, unassociated with difficulties which the present Chief Minister is in at this moment where the Government is trying to help him out of that difficulty&#x003F; Is that a good principle for us to adopt in our legislation&#x003F; Is it in fact not just a small step, but a step in the direction which is becoming so clear, of the Government putting forward legislation which in the penultimate ultimate end, will lead to independence if the Government can get it that far&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>At the time, during the discussion of the Transkei Constitution Act, the United Party agreed in principle that the various Bantu peoples should <span class="col_451-452" refersTo="page_0239"/>have control over their own areas. Why is the United Party now opposed to the Chief Minister having the prerogative to appoint his own Ministers&#x003F; The position is that the United Party wants to place obstacles in the way of the relationships between the Chief Minister and his Minister&#x2019;s whom he nominates functioning smoothly. It is not a question of their being so worked up at this stage about the Transkei eventually becoming independent; it is a question of their wanting to cause friction between the Chief Minister and his Ministers.</p>

<p>That is why they are opposing this Bill today, so that friction can develop and they can say to the outside world: This is what the National Party is doing, and look at all the things that are going wrong there in the Transkei. We know the United Party, we know their subtle politics, we know their suspicion-mongering. In this case, where the Chief Minister will have the prerogative to appoint his own Ministers and by so doing will facilitate the smooth functioning of the Transkeian Government, I cannot see why the United Party should oppose it. But they are opposing it not in the interests of the Transkei, but in their own interests. That is why I believe that this proposed amendment of the Transkei Constitution Act will eventually contribute to the smooth functioning of the constitution of the Transkei.</p>

<p>The hon. member has made it clear now, but I understood him to indicate that the description &#x201C;a state within a state&#x201D; applied to some position along the Nationalist Party road. I thought he was describing it as the ultimate position; but perhaps I was correct in thinking that he was describing it as the present position there. He seems to like the description &#x201C;state within a state&#x201D; less and less the more he thinks about it. This hardly surprises one, because we had this concept bandied about some time ago in another connection. On this question I would like to mention one other thing. There was a time when we used to hear from the opposite side of their ultimate vision in regard to the various peoples here. Sometimes it was described as a commonwealth, but then they became disenchanted with &#x201C;commonwealth&#x201D;. Sometimes it was described as a confederation, but then the former member for Kempton Park, who is now an hon. Judge of the Supreme Court, left this House and we have heard very little about that ever since. We are indeed hoping that hon. members opposite will give us their great pattern of development with the vision how these pieces will fall into place. It seems as if we will have to wait to hear a clear statement of their policy.</p>

<p>I now want to turn to the hon. member for Aliwal. He quoted virtually a clause or two from a speech which was made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he opposed the First Reading of the Transkei Constitution Bill in 1963. The passage he quoted made it quite plain that this side of the House did stand for a large measure of control over their own affairs and indeed control of the matters intimately concerning them in terms of our policy for the Bantu people. It is a far cry to assume from that statement that we will support this measure. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made it clear in that speech, which the hon. member for Aliwal mentioned, that we were opposing the Transkei Constitution Bill of 1963, because it was part of a pattern which took these parts of South Africa to total sovereign independence. From that we have never deviated. Nor have we deviated from our viewpoint that there must be a large amount of self-administration for the Bantu people. However, seeing that we again find that this is a step on the road to total sovereign independence or part of the pattern

<span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0240"/>in that direction, we consider it necessary to oppose the measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member asks where we read that in the Bill. It is quite clear that this is a development of the nature which ultimately ends in total sovereign independence. It is quite plain that the hon. the Prime Minister has invited these Bantu authorities to come and seek total independence from the Government within a very few years indeed. But apparently this is not in accordance with the desires of the hon. member for Aliwal. He appears to regret the advent of their sovereign independence.</p>

<p>From the very fact that the hon. member asks why we think this is a move in that direction. Just to clear up completely what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said in this debate in 1963 on the Transkei Constitution Bill and in order to put the quotation of the hon. member for Aliwal in the right perspective, I would like to read what my hon. leader said and said very clearly right at the outset of his speech. He said the following in Hansard, Vol. V, col. 282 on the 28th January, 1963:</p>

<block name="quote">But we are opposed to the Bill, the Long Title of which we have before us, because we believe that it is part of the pattern outlined by the Prime Minister and hon. members on the Government&#x2019;s side of the House through the years that this is to be the first step towards the ultimate fragmentation of the Republic.</block>

<p>Within seven years we have arrived at the position where this is more than proved to have been a correct forecast. At the time of the Republican Referendum, or thereabouts, there was talk of independence in perhaps 1,000 years for these reserves. Now, apparently, we can expect independence for these territories within the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>

But what a far cry that is from what hon. members opposite told members of the public at the time of the Republican Referendum and afterwards, namely that this could wait for 1,000 years.</p>

<p>The other point I wish to make is that the hon. the Deputy Minister told this House in introducing this measure that a request for this amendment had come from the Executive Committee of the Transkei Government, in other words, the Cabinet. He did not indicate to this House that the request had come from the Legislative Assembly as a whole or from the majority of the members thereof. I would be glad if the hon. the Deputy Minister would confirm that in fact there has been no request from that Legislative Assembly.</p>

<p>So, to conclude, we state quite unequivocally that we see this as a part of the pattern and a further step on the road which we believe is disastrous for South Africa. We believe it is disastrous not only for all of us in this House, but also for all the population groups in South Africa. We also believe it is equally disastrous for the Bantu people of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. D. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just resumed his seat was obviously stating the standpoint of the United Party, i.e. that they see in this measure at present before the House the road to independence for the Transkeian people. Let us inform the hon. member that if he sees this measure before the House as leading to the road towards full independence for the Transkei, he is not wrong if he does so. I do not think it is wrong to state again today that the United Party is now trying from this specific measure to bring the entire principle of independence for the Bantu homelands to the fore, where we are dealing with a request from the Legislative Assembly <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0241"/>of the Transkei, in an attempt to make political gain here. I want to state categorically, as the hon. the Prime Minister also did, that there is no obstacle in the way of any Bantu people in South Africa coming to ask for full independence. This same United Party waxed eloquent and said that not one of those Bantu nations had asked for independence. But here we now have an example of how the Legislative Assembly is asking to be led along that road when they want the Chief Minister to appoint his own ministers. I find it unthinkable that it can now be argued that provision should have been made for the Chief Minister to be able to appoint his own ministers in 1963, when the Constitution of the Transkei was laid down. The National Party has always said that the Bantu nations will be led to independence. This was a step which was a practical one at that stage. What was preferred at that stage was that the Legislative Assembly should be able to choose the Ministers. We must know that that population must also be trained in that direction. Now that this nation has reached the stage where a Chief Minister may appoint his own cabinet, which is comparable with the situation we have in this House, the United Party is objecting to this merely on the grounds that it is based on the road to independence. But the United Party also said that the Bantu reserves could themselves administer certain matters, and they themselves compared it to the provincial level. I want to leave it at that, but I would just like to remind hon. members of the fact that the United Party maintains that the Bantu may themselves control certain matters up to a level which may be compared to that of the provincial.</p>

<p>I think that in this Bill we are dealing with two matters only. It deals with the Chief Minister being able to appoint his cabinet, and that unlike the situation in the past, he may even bring a petition to the State President now asking for the removal of certain ministers, and in the second place, the expansion of the Chiefs&#x2019; representation in the Legislative Assembly. That is all it deals with. I do not think that any member in this House can have any objection to a trained Chief Minister being competent to appoint his own cabinet. Consequently the entire argument of the opposite side is based on ideology and not so much on the Bill before the House. That is why I cannot understand why we have to debate the ideology attached to the whole concept again at this stage. Let us confine ourselves to the Bill as we have it before us. No person with common sense can have any objection to that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Christiana made a few points, with which I shall deal, but first I just want to refer to one of the preceding speeches, in which an hon. member stated that we were not interested in the progress of the Transkei, but that we were merely interested in the progress of the United Party. We are allegedly condemning this legislation, not on the grounds of what it will mean for the Transkei, but on the grounds of what it will mean for us as a party. I just want to tell the hon. member that he is of course wrong, as usual. We are judging the legislation in the light of the best interests of South Africa. If we happen to be of the opinion that this Bill will not be in the best interests of our country, then we believe that we must oppose it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana was in complete agreement with us when he stated that the opposition of the United Party is aimed at the question of the pattern, of which this Bill is only a part. The Constitution of a nation is not merely an ordinary law. It is a law which contains far more than, for argument&#x2019;s sake, merely an administrative machine. It breathes a specific spirit. The development of a Constitution must be seen in particular against the background of the promises it holds for the people it deals with. This Constitution which is being given to the Transkei, and which my Nationalist friends waxed so very eloquent about, is one which holds a specific promise for the Bantu of the Transkei. That promise of course centres around the principle of independence, a term which has now become &#x201C;self-determination&#x201D; which of course does not mean &#x201C;independence&#x201D;. Those are terms one must think about.</p>

<p>I want to raise a second point. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will agree with me. As the matter stands here, it does not merely deal with the way in which a Bill will be piloted through, a minister chosen, but there is a specific symbolism attached to this aspect of the constitution. Throughout history one will find that the way in which a cabinet is constituted, who chooses the ministers, etc., is in fact one of the important symbols which indicate to the people concerned the speed at which <span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0242"/>they are developing and how close they are getting to their ultimate end, if I may call it that, which is being held out to them.</p>

<p>The fact that the hon. the Deputy Minister is at this early stage saying to the White voters&#x2014;who after all have the last say&#x2014;that these people are making rapid progress, something which is not only being said in words, but is being laid down in law, is sufficient grounds for me to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I cannot support this measure; the pattern is too clear, and I do not agree with that pattern. I am certainly not in favour of any constitutional development which may complete that pattern sooner. I think the United Party is fully entitled, in the light of the general background of the pattern which is developing here, to vote against this Bill, particular, too, in the light of the attitude which is adopted previously in this House.</p>

<p>Yes. It was a motion. Not only the hon. member for Pinelands but one speaker after another on that side made this elementary error of not hearing that this came on the direct request of the Legislative Assembly, what is more, the Legislative Assembly was unanimous in asking for this, in other words, the Government as well as the Opposition party, and they did so by way of a formal motion in the Assembly. Surely that is elementary. And yet the United Party maintains that this Bill is disastrous for South Africa.</p>

<p>Surely this attitude is somewhat ridiculous and is really taking the matter much too far. I want to place on record my strongest objection to that. I shall return to these aspects later.</p>

<p>Another striking aspect which emerged from the Opposition side is that in regard to the second aspect of this Bill, i.e. the addition of one chief to the number of chiefs in the Legislative Assembly, the representative of Kentani, is that not one single Opposition member had a word to say about it, not a single word.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they coming right. Now you must see, Sir, what the deeper significance of that is. If I remember correctly the United Party put up a fierce fight in this House against chiefs&#x2019; representation in the Legislative Assembly and said that these people should be elected members. At present that Legislative Assembly consists of 45 elected members and 64 chiefs&#x2019; representatives. In this Bill the chiefs&#x2019; representation is now being increased by one. [Interjections.] It is very, very striking that hon. members on the opposite side said nothing whatsoever this afternoon about chiefs&#x2019; representation in <span class="col_459-460" refersTo="page_0243"/>this House. As the hon. the Minister in front of me here said by way of an interjection a moment ago, they are most certainly coming right in this debate. And that is very, very strange.</p>

<p>Sir, as far as chiefs&#x2019; representation is concerned, I should like to add this: As far as I know the homelands of South Africa are the only areas in Africa where the chiefs&#x2019; representation is synchronized with elected members and where it has shown itself to be a brilliant success, to the satisfaction of the Bantu and particularly of the people here in the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;a great achievement.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, in one chamber. Hon. members on the opposite side would do well now to check up and see how they opposed this matter, but this afternoon they did not say a word about it. Sir, let me bring this important fact to your attention, i.e. that South Africa is here accomplishing a brilliant achievement in the homelands. May I also add to that that it is quite striking what happened in Africa. One of the most important reasons why Nkrumah was overthrown in Ghana was because justice was not done to the status of the chiefs there. If one considers what is happening in other parts of Africa, then one sees that things are going wrong for precisely the same reason; and if one considers what is happening to Kaunda, then one wonders what his future is going to be as a result of his having disregarded the authority of the chiefs. I should very much like to emphasize again that increasing the chiefs&#x2019; representation by one is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>But let me demonstrate further how the United Party acted in this debate. What the Legislative Assembly had unanimously requested by way of a motion&#x2014;i.e. to be able itself to appoint and dismiss Ministers&#x2014;is being opposed by the Opposition here, but what only the majority party in the Legislative Assembly requested, i.e. to increase the number of members in the Legislative Assembly by one chiefs&#x2019; representative for Kentani, that was opposed tooth and nail by the Opposition party in the Transkei Legislative Assembly because they were opposed to that on the grounds of principal. You see, therefore, how strangely the Opposition is acting here.</p>

<p>But, Sir, they did a third strange thing in regard to this Bill here this afternoon &#x2014;a very strange thing. Let me state with the greatest emphasis that it is well known that it is the policy of this side of the House to lead the Bantu peoples to independence &#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The Bantu peoples know that they can trust us. We state that this is our policy and we make no secret of it, and I therefore adhere firmly to it. No incorrect inference must therefore be made from what I am now going to say because I have qualified it with this important statement of policy which I have just made. Sir, this Bill has as little to do with the independence of the Transkei as the weather, and that was the only point which the Opposition really seized upon and in regard to which they wanted to spark off a debate here, i.e. the independence of the homelands. This is a perfectly simple little Bill. As a result of the practical experience of the Legislative Assembly in the Transkei, in regard to the method of nomination and removal of their Ministers, they addressed a unanimous request to us. The Ministry considered the request and decided that it was fair to accede to it and to embody it in this Bill. I maintain that it has absolutely nothing to do with the independence of the Transkei, and the United Party has made as bad a blunder as it is possible for one to make in trying, as they did here this afternoon, to spark off a debate on the independence of the Transkei.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to proceed to react to a few things mentioned here by United Party speakers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkei argued&#x2014;and quite frankly, in my humble opinion, did so for lack of other argument because he did not understand the Bill&#x2014; that Dr. Verwoerd must at the time have taken cognisance of this method of the nomination and removal of ministers as it was written into the constitution at the time, and that he must therefore have accepted it. The hon. member for Transkei is now putting forward the argument that if it had been acceptable for him at the <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0244"/>time, why is this other system which they are now requesting acceptable to us&#x003F; Therefore the insinuation is very plainly that there must be something behind this now. And the hon. member for South Coast went a little further, but I shall come to that in a moment. What are the facts of the matter now&#x003F;</p>

<p>The facts in regard to this matter are&#x2014; and this suddenly brings into the limelight the <i>modus operandi</i> between our department and Ministry and these Bantu peoples &#x2014;that at the time the Bunga negotiated with the Ministry and the Department of Bantu Affairs, and the request from the Bunga was that the nomination of the Chief Minister and the nomination of Ministers should take place as it was then embodied in the constitution, i.e. that they should be elected by the Legislative Assembly. I want to state today that if the Bunga had at the time requested what they are now requesting, I am convinced that it would have been given very sympathetic consideration and it would probably have been written into the Constitution at that time already. And that is all that is happening here. At the time they requested that the Legislative Assembly should elect the Ministers, but as a result of their own practical experience&#x2014;and let me say with emphasis here, in regard to which there was no interference from us&#x2014;and political development, they brought forward the unanimous request that the Chief Minister should be able to appoint his own ministers, and not the Legislative Assembly. And that is all that has happened. I want to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member for South Coast that we should of course be careful not to make laws here in order to meet &#x201C;hard cases&#x201D; for the Bantu homelands. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member for South Coast on that score, but he will as readily agree with me that if a Legislative Assembly of the format of that of the Transkei, come forward, unanimously, the Opposition as well as the governing party, with a well-motivated request, then we must consider it, and let me just say to that hon. member that he can go and take a look at the minutes. The minutes are those of 17th June, 1969, of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. That is why I say that if the Transkei Legislative Assembly comes forward with such a unanimous request, he will readily agree, we must give it our sympathetic consideration.</p>

<p>I want to add to that it is not correct to say that we are now placing a whip in the hands of the Chief Minister and that the Chief Minister is now going to be placed in a position to force our Minister and the State President of the Republic into a position in which they do not want to be. Why is it stated in the Bill as it is stated there, that if the Chief Minister wants to remove a minister, it must be done in the following way, i.e. by way of a petition. After all, the hon. member for South Coast knows how one sets about drawing up a petition. One does not snatch it out of the air. It must be accompanied by a certain measure of responsibility. Then it must go to the Commissioner-General and therefore there is an opportunity to iron out these things on the local level, if there were any suggestion of that which the hon. member for South Coast had in mind. And only after that procedure has been followed, is the petition brought through the Commissioner-General to the Minister of Bantu Affairs, and after he has dealt with it, it goes to the State President. Therefore I cannot concede that the hon. member for South Coast is in any way correct that a whip is being placed in the hands of the Chief Minister with which he will be able to make things difficult for us.</p>

<p>This afternoon the hon. member for Aliwal spoke for the first time in this House after his election to the Bantu Affairs Commission. In the first place I want to congratulate him on his election to the Bantu Affairs Commission, and in the second place on the good contribution he made in the House this afternoon. I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member that the United Party, apart from what I have already said, this afternoon literally tried to put a spanner in the works of the smooth functioning of relationships between the Chief Minister of the Transkei and the Legislative Assembly. I do not think that they will at all succeed in doing so.</p>

<p>With that I think I have dealt with all the points raised by hon. members. I also want to thank the hon. member for Ermelo and the other members on this side of the House for their contribution. The hon. member for Ermelo raised the question regarding clause 7. If a new chief minister should be elected and is saddled with a hostile cabinet, clause 7 makes it very clear in fact that the way in which that Chief Minister should set about matters is to request by way of a petition through the <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0245"/>Commissioner-General, the Minister of Bantu Administration and the State President that such a hostile cabinet be removed. If a good case can be made out for the removal of that hostile cabinet, the Chief Minister will in that way be able to get rid of such a cabinet.</p>

<p>With this I think that I have now dealt with everything. I want to repeat that I do find it a pity that the United Party should have acted as they did this afternoon in regard to a very simple little Bill such as this.</p>

<heading>SEEDS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at the time of and with the passing by Parliament of the Seeds Act, 1961, an important milestone was reached in the development process of our own seed industry. There is probably no need to emphasize the important part which good seeds play in the agricultural industry. Because it is essential from the nature of the case for agricultural legislation always to keep abreast of changing problems, technical development and the needs of the agricultural industry, locally as well as overseas, it has become necessary to effect certain amendments to the Seeds Act, and I should like to draw the attention of this House to them.</p>

<p>The definitions of &#x201C;variety&#x201D; and &#x201C;kind&#x201D;, which represent important concepts in the <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0246"/>Act, are being amended so as to adopt them to the latest international definitions, and this can be to the advantage of our seed-trade with overseas countries. The amendments to the other definitions in clause 1, are merely adjustments.</p>

<p>Because of the fact that the sale of seeds in smaller packages such as packets, tins, etc., is playing a bigger part, it has become essential to gain more control over the quality of seeds which are sold in such packages. By means of the registration of packers of seed, as envisaged in clause 5, it will, however, be possible to exercise the necessary control.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate the misunderstanding which has arisen with regard to the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for the recognition of new varieties, it has been thought fit to redraft the section concerned, and to facilitate its administration at the same time. Henceforth this will mean that a variety will be included in the list if it complies with the requirements laid down in the definition of &#x201C;Variety&#x201D;. Recognition will be granted on the basis of distinguish ability, homogeneity and stability. Performances in respect of agricultural or industrial value will no longer be qualifying factors for inclusion in the list.</p>

<p>The insertion of section 9A envisages a system of investigation which not only amends the present requirement in terms of which all varieties submitted for inclusion in the varietal list have to be tested, but it will also be of the utmost importance to our farmers. In terms of the new system the Minister may, after a variety has been included in the list, decide to have it tested, in which case the variety may not be sold before the result has been published. Farmers will then be able to decide for themselves, on the basis of the published results, whether or not they want to cultivate the variety concerned. If, however, the results are so poor that it will not be in the public interest to use the seeds, the Minister may direct the deletion of the variety form the list.</p>

<p>In order to afford the users of seeds the necessary protection, varieties already included in the list may also be subjected to an investigation with a view to publishing the results or deleting a variety from the list.</p>

<p>Under the new policy as envisaged in clauses 7 and 8, of which I have just explained the details, the department will be able to pay more attention to investigations of seeds such as mealies, which have great economic value. It will, for example, allow of the temporary holding in abeyance of investigations of certain vegetable or spice seeds, which play a small economic part. Therefore the varieties concerned may still be placed on the list and sales may continue.</p>

<p>After careful consideration it has been decided to repeal the Foundation Seed Act of 1961. The most important consideration is that the Foundation Seed Board has for financial reasons been unable to exercise its functions properly. Furthermore, plant breeders in the private sector have made considerable progress in respect of hybrid mealies since 1961, and the Foundation Seed Board, which has primarily dealt with the handling of foundation seed of official varieties, started playing a smaller and smaller part.</p>

<p>Because of the fact that some of the principles laid down in the Foundation Seed Act of 1961 still remain very important and must be retained, provision has been made for the establishment of a basic seed scheme in the proposed section 14. This scheme will have the same objects as the existing foundation seed scheme, and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will, therefore, continue to maintain the official and other important varieties which are not seen to by private breeders, and to make breeders&#x2019; material available to approved private seed organisations for the production of basic seed in terms of the basic seed scheme. Basic seed production will, therefore, be undertaken and financed by private organisations so that the same object as envisaged under the Foundation Seed Act may be achieved and the Foundation Seed Board may be dissolved without seed production in the Republic being detrimentally affected. I may add that through its various schemes the Department of Agricultural Technical Services will still retain technical control over the cultivation of seed.</p>

<p>The words &#x201C;basic seed&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;foundation seed&#x201D; are being used in order to bring this concept into line with the international one.</p>

<p>In the proposed section 14 (1) (d) provision is also being made for participation in overseas certification schemes such as the fodder crop seed scheme of the O.E.C.D. (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), which has a high international status and of which <span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0247"/>South Africa is already a member. The Department is also keenly interested in the vegetable seed scheme which is at present being drafted by the O.E.C.D. The basic requirements under the O.E.C.D. correspond to our seed certification scheme, and seed which has been certified in terms of the latter scheme automatically qualify for certification under the O.E.C.D. scheme. Participation in the schemes of the O.E.C.D. therefore opens many doors to South Africa as far as the export of seed is concerned, especially because the schemes enjoy official recognition in the major Western countries and also has the support of the International Seed Traders&#x2019; Association.</p>

<p>The other amendments proposed in the Bill, are intended merely to facilitate the administration of the Act and to make it as streamlined as possible.</p>

<p>The draft Bill has also been discussed in detail with the South African Agricultural Union and the organized seed trade, and they are satisfied with the proposed amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. the Deputy Minister at once that this Bill has our support. The hon. the Deputy Minister has explained why the amendments have become essential. We on this side of the House support this Bill mainly for some reasons which I just want to outline in brief.</p>

<p>In the first instance, we support it because there has apparently been repeated discussions between the department of the hon. the Minister and the South African Agricultural Union with regard to this matter. Since discussions have taken place and since problems have been ironed out, we on this side find no reason for standing in the way of the South African Agricultural Union when they want legislation which will serve to promote the best interests of South African agriculture.</p>

<p>In the second place, we support this Bill because the farmers in South Africa will have to rely to an increasing extent on our own South African seed products. Because this legislation is aimed at giving greater protection to the South African farmers who have to use the seeds, we on this side of the House feel that we should not stand in their way. We are particularly pleased about the inclusion of the packers of seeds in this legislation, because they play such an important part in the distribution of seeds.</p>

<p>This legislation also contains measures which will undoubtedly promote the import and export of seeds and ensure that the quality of the product entering South Africa will undoubtedly be of a high quality. Therefore, as regards the export of South Africa&#x2019;s own products, it is necessary to protect our name. Consequently we have no objection to the taking of steps in this regard as well so as to ensure that our product which will be marketed abroad will be only of the best. To a certain extent it is a pity that we have to learn that the Foundation Seed Act of 1961 never really got off the ground properly because of the fact that the Foundation Seed Board experienced certain problems with regard to its functions. Nevertheless, it is some consolation to know that provision will be made under this legislation for what the Board had been able to do under the basic seed scheme, and that the problems associated with the old Foundation Seed Board have been eliminated.</p>

<p>We want to tell the Department of Agricultural Technical Services that the passing of this legislation has our support, and that we hope a great deal more will be done in the future to ensure that we shall be marketing only the best product by producing the best quality seeds we can in South Africa. The expenditure of the South African farmers, as regards what they have put into the soil, is very high. If, in addition to that, a risk is attached to the type of seed he is to put into the soil, his risks are increased so much the more. By means of this legislation it can at least be ensured that the risk in this regard will be smaller as the quality of the seed will be good. That is why we support the hon. the Deputy Minister in this legislation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member for Newton Park has said we are supporting this Bill and I rise merely to deal with one or two matters which I would like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister. I do so in order to give him time to look at them before we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Firstly, I would like to deal with the definition of &#x201C;variety&#x201D; in clause 1 (h) of the Bill. Should the word &#x201C;and&#x201D; not be added at the end of paragraph (a) after the word &#x201C;properties&#x201D; and at the end of paragraph (b) after the word &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D;&#x003F; I see that at the end of paragraph (c) the <span class="col_469-470" refersTo="page_0248"/>word &#x201C;and&#x201D; is added and I wonder if it should not be added at the end of paragraph (a) and (b) as well. I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to have a look at that definition.</p>

<p>Secondly, I would again like to make an appeal on behalf of the English language to stop it being murdered as in some of the Bills we get before us. In the new section 9 (4) (a) substituted by clause 7 of the Bill appears the word &#x201C;varietal&#x201D;. I do not know how to pronounce the word, because I could not find it in any dictionary. The word appears again in the new section 9 (4) (b) and in the new section 9A (1) (a) substituted by clause 8 of the Bill. In the new section 10 substituted by clause 9 of the Bill the word appears once again. We could have a good discussion as to whether there is such a word, but by the time the draftsman came to the new section 11 substituted by clause 10 of the Bill the same list is called a &#x201C;variety&#x201D; list. In the new section 12 (a) (i) he again uses the word &#x201C;variety&#x201D;. So he calls the same list a &#x201C;varietal&#x201D; list four times and then uses the proper word twice. I suggest that the people concerned make up their minds what they want to call it and I want to suggest they call it a &#x201C;variety&#x201D; list. This is the correct word to use, because it has a known meaning and also because I have been unable to find the other word in any dictionary. I know the hon. the Deputy Minister will want to be warned of these things before we get to the Committee Stage and that is the reason I point them out now.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I can assure the hon. member for South Coast that I will go into the matters raised by him. I did not study the English version of the Bill myself and I agree that the word &#x201C;variety&#x201D; seems to be the correct one. In the Afrikaans text the word &#x201C;vari&#x00EB;teitslys&#x201D; is used. I will go into these matters, however, and I want to thank the hon. member for drawing my attention to them. If there are any errors it will be corrected in the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill which is being submitted to this hon. House today, is merely intended to remedy a few administrative problems. The amendments in clauses 1 to 3 are being introduced with a view to metrication, while the amendment in clause 4 will eliminate the problem experienced in finding suitable persons who are prepared to serve on the boards. At present it is laid down in the Act that remuneration amounting to R6 per day inclusive of travelling and subsistence allowance, may be paid to the members of the board. This amount is inadequate and in terms of the proposed amendment the tariffs will be adjusted as the need arises. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have no objection to the second reading of the Fencing Amendment Bill. I think the most important provision in this Bill is clause 4 which will allow members of the boards who will deal with any dispute in connection with a fence to receive a higher remuneration than R6 per day to which they were previously entitled.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think it is possible today to find any farmer or any prominent businessman or other person who would be prepared to serve on a board of this nature for R6 a day. We know that in the past they were entitled to claim travelling and accommodation expenses. But now, of course, if this amendment is passed they will be entitled to a much higher remuneration. Because of this important provision we on this side of the House have no objection to this Bill.</p>

<p>*Clauses 1 and 2 deal, of course, with metrication only where, in the case of a fence that has to be erected, the two owners are obliged to clear the area up to five feet from its centre. Clause 2 applies only in those cases where a fence spans a road and where a 15-feet gate has to be erected. Of course, this becomes 4.5 meters now. We on this side of the House can find no objection to such amendments arising out of metrication. For that reason we support this Bill.</p>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>This Bill rectifies certain shortcomings in the Soil Conservation Act of 1969 which have come to light since the commencement of that Act. The amendments are necessary with a view to facilitating the proper implementation of the Act. I should like to call the attention of the House to it. In section 1 the definition of &#x201C;land occupier or occupier of land&#x201D; is being amended because problems are being experienced with persons selling sand, stone and soil and not wanting to apply the necessary soil conservation measures. In the majority of cases these individuals are contractors who are mining the material and removing it, and these persons have no interest whatsoever in the erosion vulnerability of the land. It is therefore necessary for provision to be made for these persons to be compelled, by means of a direction in terms of section 3, to apply the necessary measures in the interests of soil conservation.</p>

<p>A definition of &#x201C;large stock and small stock&#x201D; is being proposed because the term &#x201C;stock&#x201D;, as used in section 3 (1) (j), is vague, and this entails misunderstanding when the number of stock is prescribed for a relevant farm. With the new definitions the position will be put very much more clearly.</p>

<p>The amendment in section 3 is necessary with a view to prescribing proper grazing practices. The stipulation of the relationship of the number of large stock to the number of small stock is a very important factor with a view to ensuring the judicious utilization of our grazing land.</p>

<p>The repeal of section 7 (4) is being proposed because, although the intention of protecting future owners is a good one, it appears as if there will be quite a lot of administrative work involved, particularly after the Registrar of Deeds pointed to certain problems. However, now it is being proposed that a land owner&#x2019;s contribution will be determined as soon as the planning stage of the soil conservation work is completed, payable after completion of the work. An agreement will then be drawn up with the present owner for payment of the contribution, which will then mean that the fears of future owners will fall away. With the fixing of the purchase price, if the land should be sold, the costs of these soil conservation works can, of course, be brought into account.</p>

<p>With a view to expediting the payment of subsidies, increasingly more reliance is being placed on the farmer to furnish necessary information by means of statements. With the proposed amendment of section 21 it will be an offence if false statements or information are furnished. This principle accords with that contained in the Income Tax Act of 1962, and this ought to facilitate the administration of the various aid schemes considerably.</p>

<p>The amendment in section 23 appeared necessary in order to delegate certain powers under the Act to regional heads, and in some cases to extension officers. It is also necessary to delegate powers to more than one senior officer because they are frequently away from the office as a result of numerous tasks.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. M. STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>As in the case of the previous Bill, we also support the passing of the Second Reading of this Bill. There is just a question or two I should like to put to the hon. the Minister, i.e. in connection with clause 1, where the words &#x201C;any person who has a right to remove sand, stone or soil&#x201D; are being inserted. Will it also be possible to make this relevant clause applicable to the divisional councils we have in the Cape, who frequently come along to farms and remove stone and soil in order to repair roads or to build a new road&#x003F; In doing such works they frequently remove a tremendous amount of soil and stone. Can this clause also be made applicable to them&#x003F; Because frequently it is not a private contractor but a divisional council that makes use of this facility. It frequently happens that they do not care in what condition they leave the <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0250"/>farmer&#x2019;s land, or the surroundings where they remove the soil.</p>

<p>In the second place I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is also possible for the definition of &#x201C;large stock and small stock&#x201D; to include certain kinds of game, because these days there are many farmers who purchase game with which to supplement their incomes as a result of poor stock prices. I think it only right that when a man is allowed to keep game, and when a direction is furnished to him in terms of the Soil Conservation Act, that game shall also be taken into consideration. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether this is the intention. If this is his intention, all well and good. As I read the proposed new definition, game is, in fact, covered under &#x201C;such other animals&#x201D;. &#x2019;</p>

<p>Sir, then I want to refer the hon. the Minister to clause 3, where subsection (4) of section 7 is now being deleted. Subsection (4) was concerned with the registration on a man&#x2019;s title deed of any debt that may be outstanding in connection with soil conservation work done on his farm. We can understand the subsection now being deleted; this is altogether reasonable. But how is a prospective buyer who wants to buy such land going to be aware of the fact that certain debts are still outstanding&#x003F; Apparently these are not large amounts. Our main aim is to protect the buyer. Can the Department not register on the soil conservation plan that an amount of R700 or an amount of R1,000, or whatever the case may be, is still owing to the Department of Agricultural Credit under that soil conservation plan&#x003F; I think it only reasonable that a prospective buyer be protected. A person does not want him to find out later that there is still a considerable amount, for which the previous owner is responsible, which was not registered on the title deed. I therefore ask the hon. the Minister whether repealing subsection (4) is sufficient protection for the prospective buyer of such land.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I just want to deal for a moment with the point raised by the hon. member for Newton Park, the question of the farming of game, a development which is now gathering momentum. There are quite a number of farmers today who for a time ran game and domestic stock on their farms; they gradually got rid of their domestic stock and replaced it with game. Game is generally capable, under natural conditions, of making better use of the browse and the grazing that is available, particularly in certain bushveld areas, than domestic stock; so there has been a tendency, particularly in drought years, for people to go in for game farming. Sir, the matter has reached the stage where, for example, the Natal Parks Board recently got an order for game breeding stock from reserves totalling R70,000. One farmer was prepared to spend R70,000 to buy breeding stock for game. I am doubtful in my own mind as to whether this provision in the clause meets the situation. I refer to clause 1 (b) which, after defining &#x201C;large stock&#x201D; goes on to say &#x201C;and such other animals as the Minister may by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> declare to be large stock for the purposes of this Act&#x201D;. Then similarly under (c) the Minister may declare other animals to be small stock for the purposes of the Act. I am not quite sure whether that really meets the situation. I do not believe as a matter of fact that the people who are going in for game farming are in any way contravening the principles of conservation. On the contrary, as a group, I think they are very good soil and water conservationists, and I do not think that there is any need for the Minister to feel that there is a loophole here and that it must be plugged quickly. I do not believe that. I think the Minister has plenty of time. I think he can take time with his officials to scan the whole position. He can have a good look at it and then decide how best this position should be dealt with if it is to be dealt with by legislation, but I do not think it meets the situation merely to declare certain animals to be large stock for the purposes of this Act and other animals to be small stock. I do not think that that is going to be the way to deal with the situation which is developing. Sir, I bring this to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention now. I say that this is a growing industry. It is gathering momentum. I believe that economically it is a very, very good thing indeed so far as our livestock industry is concerned, and that the people who are entrepreneurs or who are coming forward now and playing their part in the initial development of the industry, want all the support and help that they can get. But a time may come when some control of this nature will be necessary. I suggest to the Minister that he take time by the forelock and that he and his officials should have a good look at the development that is taking place with a <span class="col_475-476" refersTo="page_0251"/>view to dealing with this matter when he comes along with some other amendment, if he feels then that legislation is necessary. I do not think legislation is necessary at the present time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_agriculture">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE</person>:</from>

<p>I can jointly answer the questions of the hon. member for Newton Park and the hon. member for South Coast. Firstly I want to refer to the question of sand, stone or soil that is removed. I frankly admit that in terms of the Soil Conservation Act we unfortunately have no power to act against provincial councils and divisional councils. But in the past we have found that we get very good co-operation from them. My experience with the provincial councils, in cases where quarries are dug or drainage furrows are constructed alongside roads, was that the soil conservation committees consulted with the provincial councils about what is done with the run-off along roads. Quarries unfortunately have to be dug. They then agree that the quarries should be dug at an angle in order to combat erosion as far as possible. But I say frankly that it is not the intention to compel the divisional councils or to issue certain directions to them.</p>

<p>With regard to the definition of &#x201C;large stock&#x201D; and &#x201C;small stock&#x201D;, to which the hon. members for South Coast and Newton Park referred, I want to give the hon. member for South Coast the assurance that we must encourage people to farm with game, where this is practicable. If it will be more economical for him, he is welcome to farm with game if he wants to improve his own financial position and does not want to have his veld trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>But in the Act we have specifically defined large stock in such a way that it is classified as cattle, horses, donkeys, mules and other large stock. This means that if we want to add that a man is farming with blue wildebeest or with eland&#x2014;he can never farm with kudu, because they jump over all the fences, but if he has certain animals which he purchased from the Natal Parks Board and he says, &#x201C;This is the carrying capacity of my veld, but here I have a lot of blue wildebeest&#x201D;, then they qualify under large stock. But then we come to the next man. In the past we only had the definition &#x201C;stock&#x201D;, and the next man is one who is farming with small stock, but he also has a lot of impala, which in my opinion fall under small stock. We have already included ostriches under the livestock withdrawal scheme and the fodder subsidy scheme. One can obtain a subsidy for ostrich fodder, but one cannot define each one in the Act, and that is why we have said that this is large stock and this is small stock; and then there is other stock that we cannot define here, but which we can include to cover this.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke further of the registration of the title deed. That is correct. The hon. member would like to protect the buyer of the land. Members of the Opposition have previously drawn our attention to the fact that work is piling up at the registrar&#x2019;s office, and we should like to facilitate their task. The hon. member must now remember that when we tackle a major work where this is applicable, the individual receives an average subsidy of 90 per cent or 95 per cent. On a work of R10,000 his contribution is therefore minimal and he signs the I.O.U. that he is responsible for that debt. But supposing he has not paid it, something that happens in many cases. I do not know of such a case, because it is a very small amount, and there are many of them who again borrow from Agricultural Credit in order to pay this small amount of 5 per cent, their contribution. But supposing they have kept silent about it during the transaction in which the farm changes hands, the buyer of the land still always has the benefit of that conservation work that was done there at a subsidy of 95 per cent. I can see that the hon. member is concerned about the buyer, and against the title deed there is no registration to the effect that he is protected. But in practice this is not of any real importance; in the cases we have, the contributions of the owner of the land are so minimal that he usually repays it. In addition, it is our experience that where these major works are done on a farm, the farm appreciates in value to such an extent that the individual does not readily want to sell it, because he can farm profitably on it. But in the future, if we find in practice that we are having difficulties, we can review these matters again. I think this is clear now.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</block>

<p>The background to and the details of this Bill have been explained in a memorandum which I have tabled. However, for the sake of clarity and in order to correct certain misconceptions, it is necessary to refer to matters dealt with in that memorandum.</p>

<p>At the outset I want to state categorically that the Government will not deviate from past assurances to the different Bantu nations of the Republic that it is the firm and irrevocable intention of the Government to lead each individual nation to self-government and ultimate possible independence.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes&#x2014;possible. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can go and play with something else instead of playing with words. I do not like it at this stage. The tempo of progress on this course will largely depend on each nation&#x2019;s ability and in this respect the Government has over the years and with the system of government provided for in the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, been instrumental in developing leadership qualities and laying the foundations for that degree of statesmanship and the experience in administration which are so necessary for the government of a nation.</p>

<p>I know that in the beginning the system of Bantu Authorities was condemned, ridiculed and belittle in certain circles, inside and outside this House. If they have only limited respect for the traditional Bantu institutions those persons must today, to their shame, admit that they disparaged that which is the very essence of a nation&#x2019;s existence. Today they have ample reason to admit that they were wrong in their approach to Bantu Authorities.</p>

<p>The initial steps for the founding of sound systems of government for the Bantu were taken in the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, and other legislation applicable to the then Transkei, wherein provision was made for, <i>inter alia,</i> the establishment of tribal, regional and territorial authorities in this order.</p>

<p>Subsequently, legal recognition was accorded in the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959 (Act No. 46 of 1959), to the fact that the Bantu peoples of the Republic did not constitute one homogeneous people but formed separate national units on the basis of descent, language and culture. Expression was given in that Act to the intention to provide for the gradual development of the different national units within their own areas to self-governing units on the basis of Bantu systems of government&#x2014;systems for which provision had of course been made in the aforementioned Bantu Authorities Act, 1951.</p>

<p>Since the passing of the Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959, there has been a continual process of training the different Bantu authorities in the intricacies of government, with special attention focused on the territorial authorities as the highest institutions of government within the framework of the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951.</p>

<p>For various reasons, one of which was past experience in different forms of local government, it was possible to accelerate the process of training in the Transkei, with the result that in 1963 self-government could be granted to that territory on the basis of the Transkei Constitution Act, 1963 (Act No. 48 of 1963).</p>

<p>In respect of the rest of the Republic, territorial authorities have in the process of training been reorganized and required to assume ever-increasing responsibilities for the administration in their respective areas to the maximum provided for in the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, and ancillary legislation. But the stage has now been reached where there is a generally felt need for legislation to place the Bantu authorities on at least an equal footing with the Transkei in so far as self-government is concerned.</p>

<p>This need for increased powers of government is felt by the Bantu as well as the Government. The Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, has, as I have already indicated, served excellently to activate and train the various authorities. However, the Act has its limitations in respect of the powers of government of the highest institution, namely the territorial authority, as the matters <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0253"/>in respect of which it may legislate and, consequently, the matters falling under its day to day administration, are limited. These limitations can be remedied only by further legislation of this Parliament.</p>

<p>This brings me to my approach with regard to the form or pattern of the legislation.</p>

<p>Basically one of two methods could be adopted, namely: firstly, an Act passed by Parliament in respect of each Bantu nation, or, secondly, an Act containing general provisions common to all Bantu nations and enabling provisions for the specific matters which may vary from nation to nation.</p>

<p>In weighing up the two methods, one must of course have regard to the needs of the situation, which must dictate the form which the legislation is to take. When the needs in this instance are analysed, it is found that the basic requirements in respect of each nation are a central body vested with legislative powers and an executive. When details of the legislation are considered in this light it is obvious that, while there could be basic differences from nation to nation in the composition of the Legislative and the Executive and the way in which they function, there are hardly likely to be material differences in the powers exercised by them and in respect of certain of their functions. It is consequently immediately obvious that the situation can be met by an Act which can be applied in respect of all Bantu homelands concerned in that it provides fully for matters which will be common to all homelands and which is enabling in respect of those matters which could differ from homeland to homeland. In fact, such an Act would correspond with the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, in its present form in so far as that Act is enabling in respect of the establishment and detail of the different authorities but is making direct provision for their powers and functions.</p>

<p>The advantages of an Act such as this one under consideration are immediately apparent if weighed up against a separate Act for each Bantu area, which will <i>inter alia</i> mean a multiplicity of Acts and unnecessary, inordinate delays in dealing with the different nations.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the Act is divided into three parts. I am referring to the Bill before us.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 deals with the present system of self-government in Bantu areas and here we find the provisions relating to the establishment, constitution and legislative powers of a legislative assembly, the executive government and ancillary provisions relating to matters such as finance, inferior administrative bodies, justice and the public service&#x2014;all matters normally associated with the good government and administration of an area. Chapter I is in effect complete in itself and it is possible under that Chapter to establish a fully-fledged system of government for an area.</p>

<p>The effect of Chapter 2 is to enable the government established under Chapter 1 to progress to a higher level of autonomy by giving it the status of a self-governing territory inside the Republic. Such a Bantu government will then be empowered to repeal Acts of Parliament relating to matters under its jurisdiction, and to provide for matters which are normally associated with self-governing status such as a high court, a flag and an anthem. In that way, then, it is possible for the area of each individual Bantu nation to progress to a fully-fledged self-governing territory on the basis of the Transkei as we know it at present.</p>

<p>The different clauses of the Bill have been explained in the memorandum which I have tabled and I do not consider it necessary to deal in detail with each clause in this speech. I therefore propose to refer only to certain aspects of clauses which I feel merit special attention at this stage. I will in actual fact deal with almost all of them.</p>

<p>Clause 1 is permissive in the sense that it authorizes the State President to establish a legislative assembly for an area for which a territorial authority has been established. This provision immediately defines the scope of the Bill, namely that it can be applied only in respect of an area for which a territorial authority has been established and is operating under the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951. It should be emphasized that consultation with the territorial authority is a prerequisite for the establishment of the legislative assembly, as it is for the constitution of the assembly under clause 2 and the executive council which comes into being under clause 5 upon the establishment of the assembly. A further point which should not be overlooked, is that clauses 2 and 5 leave ample scope for the determination of the method of constitution so that it is possible to provide for each individual nation in accordance with its needs and traditions. I also want <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0254"/>to draw particular attention to the fact that the powers to provide for different matters in terms of these two clauses are in effect no wider than the powers conferred upon the State President by the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, to provide by regulation for the constitution of a territorial authority.</p>

<p>Clauses 3 and 4 regarding the matters in respect of which a legislative assembly may make laws and those that are reserved for legislation by an assembly, are self-explanatory. Clause 3 should of course be read with Schedule 1, and it should be noted that prior to becoming a self-governing territory the legislative assembly concerned is not empowered to amend or repeal Acts of Parliament and the prior approval of the State President is required before the assembly can provide in its laws for their application in respect of citizens outside the area but within the Republic.</p>

<p>I need not elaborate on the matters reserved from legislation by a legislative assembly in terms of clause 4, except perhaps to point out that similar provisions exist in respect of the Transkei.</p>

<p>The financial matters provided for in clauses 6 to 10 are customary provisions and to a large extent follow existing provisions relating to Bantu authorities.</p>

<p>Clauses 11 and 12 are necessary to regulate the position of paramount chiefs, chiefs, headmen, and existing Bantu authorities, while clause 13 provides in detail for the disestablishment of a territorial authority as a result of the establishment of a legislative assembly.</p>

<p>Clauses 14 and 15, relating to the administration of justice, should be read with item 12 of Schedule I, which confines the powers of a legislative assembly and an executive council, to the administration of justice in respect of Bantu.</p>

<p>Clauses 16 to 25 are consequential and call for no particular comment.</p>

<p>I now come to Chapter 2, that is clauses 26 to 36, relating to self-governing territories to which I referred earlier on in this speech.</p>

<p>In terms of clause 26 the State President may, after consultation with the legislative assembly, by proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> declare the area for which that legislative assembly has been established to be a self-governing territory in the Republic. It is therefore quite clear that in this clause our Parliament is in fact offered the opportunity to consider the principle that every one of the remaining Bantu homelands may become a self-governing territory in the Republic. Only the timing and the specific details of this constitutional development are not laid down in this Bill as it will be dealt with in the subsequent proclamations.</p>

<p>Once the area has been declared to be a self-governing territory the provisions of the next succeeding clauses come into operation in respect of the self-governing territory, namely clauses 27 and 28 providing for a flag, the design of which is to be approved by the legislative assembly and a national anthem to be approved by the State President on the recommendation of the legislative assembly, respectively; clause 29 which vests the executive government in a Cabinet, consisting of Ministers to be elected from the members of the legislative assembly; clauses 30 to 33 providing in detail for the legislative powers of the legislative assembly, the assent to its laws by the State President and the promulgation and enrolment of the laws; clause 34 providing for a High Court; clause 35 providing for the audit of the books and accounts, and clause 36 enabling the land to be transferred to the Government of the area concerned.</p>

<p>Chapter 3 provides for miscellaneous matters. Attention is drawn in particular to clause 37, in terms of which a proclamation issued under the Act is to be tabled in this House and in the Other Place, and can be rejected by resolution passed by both Houses during the same session.</p>

<p>No, it does not have to be passed, but it can be rejected.</p>

<p>Schedule 1 lists the matters in respect of which a legislative assembly may make laws and in respect of which the executive government vests in the executive council or Cabinet, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Schedule 2 provides for certain amendments to the Bantu Authorities Act, 1951, and the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970, details of which have been furnished in the memorandum.</p>

<p>On the question of the Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, it should be noted that the whole Bill under consideration revolves around citizens of the areas concerned as the legislative assemblies are to be constituted from citizens of the homelands concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0255"/>*Mr. Speaker, it will probably be conceded&#x2014;at least, I hope so&#x2014;that this Bill, just like the Transkei Constitution at the time, is a further logical development of this Government&#x2019;s policy of helping to bring about a government of its own for every individual Bantu nation. Therefore, by means of this Bill the consciousness of having an identity of one&#x2019;s own and the urge towards realizing oneself, which are characteristic of every nation on earth, are finding expression in an orderly manner for every Bantu nation. This differentiation, i.e. that the White nation and the various Bantu nations in South Africa will therefore each have a government of its own in accordance with its own character and needs, is not only a natural phenomenon throughout the world, but also complies with the Christian outlook on life of live and let live, which is in effect a basic principle of the policy of separate development.</p>

<p>You may therefore conclude from this, Sir, that the fundamental explanation of this policy can be traced back to the reality of multi-nationality, i.e. that a diversity of Bantu nations are emerging in the Republic of South Africa, each connected with its own area and with its own distinctive character and characteristics, with marked differences amongst themselves.</p>

<p>For the systematic and purposeful development of every homeland into economic areas which will continually grow stronger, a sound administrative and political structure is essential, especially in view of the fact that political stability is a prerequisite for economic growth.</p>

<p>In actual fact this Bill is the outcome of the desires of the respective Bantu nations themselves, and is not being forced upon them by the Government. During its 1970 session the Tswana Territorial Authority adopted a motion in which they requested that self-government on the Transkei basis be granted to them. I have already informed the House of this. In the meantime some of the other nations have, through their Executive Councils, associated themselves with this move. Those people who did not specifically request a higher form of self-government, requested more powers, such as those for which provision is being made in Chapter 1 of the Bill under discussion. In all these cases the requests were made spontaneously by the Bantu authorities themselves.</p>

<p>To the objective observer it is clear&#x2014;and this is a very important matter&#x2014;that at present the Bantu nations in the Republic of South Africa are accepting the policy of separate development on a large scale as they see in that policy the retention of their national identity. Hope and expectations for the future are implied for them within the framework of this natural policy. Their national feeling which is awakening at the moment, surpasses the boldest expectations, and under no circumstances will it be possible to check that feeling again; but it is extremely important that this national feeling be guided into the right channels.</p>

<p>It was in this spirit that this Bill was drafted and prepared. On several occasions my departments held discussions with the existing Bantu governments, and, furthermore, I myself deliberated with the Executive Councils concerned on the principles of the Bill. All the negotiations were conducted in an exceptionally good spirit&#x2014; without exception. When the Bill had already been cast in its final form, all the Executive Councils made a point of informing their nations properly about the contents of the Bill. The respective Executive Councils and the Executive Committee of the Zulu Territorial Authority were content with the pattern of this Constitution for all the national units within the Republic of South Africa (excluding the Transkei, which has already been finalized); I repeat, the pattern of this Bill. Typical of the reaction of all the Territorial Authorities, is the following resolution of the Executive Council of the Venda Territorial Authority which, signed by all six members, was forwarded to me, and I am going to quote it fully&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Executive Council of the Venda Territorial Authority has been moved by the Draft Constitution for the Bantu Homelands, 1971, which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and of Bantu Education proposes to introduce at the next session of Parliament. On behalf of the Territorial Authority and the Venda Nation, the Executive Council wishes to thank the hon. the Minister and the Government very sincerely for the trust that they are placing in the Bantu Nations of South Africa by enabling each one of the said Nations to become a self-governing nation. The Venda Nation is also desirous to develop as a self-governing nation and is very thankful towards the Government for the opportunities offered. The Executive Council requests that the powers contained in the Bill be <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0256"/>conferred on the Venda Nation as soon as possible.</block>

<block name="quote">May the blessing of the Lord also rest on this step of the Government.</block>

<p>So much for the resolution passed by them. Then I may just mention to the hon. members that the entire Bill with an explanatory memorandum was submitted in full to all of these Executive Councils. Subsequent to those documents having been studied, these resolutions were passed, and similar resolutions have been passed by all the other Executive Councils.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question&#x003F; The hon. the Minister emphasized that the Zulus had only accepted the pattern of this Bill. Now the hon. the Minister says that they have accepted the Bill as such. What is the difference&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is no difference. I said that I had discussed the pattern of the Bill with all of them and that they had accepted the pattern, and after that pattern had been accepted, I made the Bill available to them and they accepted that as well. Therefore, they accepted both of them.</p>

<p>This Bill is the basis on which every nation can now continue building in order that it may, with the assistance of the Government of the Republic and by proclamation, draft its own constitution, which will fit in with that nation.</p>

<p>It cannot be argued away that this political development within South Africa is an unavoidable one and is taking an inevitable course here, and for that reason it is essential that in determining the guide lines along which this development is to take place, the absolute requirement should be laid down that the relations between this Government and the respective homeland governments should remain basically sound. In this case reciprocal consultations between the Government and the Territorial Authorities have laid the foundation on which this Bill rests, and this is also the reason for the satisfaction with this step among the responsible Bantu leaders and nations. In the future, too, reciprocal consultations will remain of decisive importance in guaranteeing the best mutual relations.</p>

<p>Time will prove that this Bill was a sensible measure for enabling all the Bantu nations in this multi-national situation to develop towards self-determination and independence. It would have been a happy day if everybody here supported this measure, for then there would in time to come not be people who would regret the negative attitude they adopted in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not think there is any doubt in the minds of anybody in the Chamber or outside as to what the attitude of the United Party is in relation to this Bill. I have no hesitation at the outset in moving the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister certainly hoped that this would be a happy day for him and that this Bill would be accepted by everybody in the House. I am sorry to spoil his day which is near its end and can only say that this will not be a lucky day for the Government. The hon. the Minister started off by explaining why this Bill was introduced and he said that he has issued a White Paper in this regard and for that I want to thank him. White Papers are always very useful in studying bills of this nature. He dealt with the introductory remark in the White Paper which deals with the &#x201C;irrevocable intention of the Government to lead each individual nation to self-government and independence &#x2026;&#x201D;. The White Paper makes this quite clear. These words can also be found in the preamble. The Minister, however, has added a word, because he said &#x201C;self-government and possible independence&#x201D;.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>It does make a big difference. The basis of this Government&#x2019;s policy is that the Reserves will eventually have complete sovereign independence and without this ideal and goal for the Reserves the policy of the Government has no moral justification.</p>

<from><span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0257"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Oh no, one cannot deal with it as easily as that. This is a most important statement the hon. the Minister has made. Speaking on an earlier Bill the hon. the Deputy Minister made it quite clear that the aim of this Government was to give independence to the Reserves. The Chief Whip on the Government side said so too. Unless the Government does this, its policy has no moral justification. The whole basis of Government policy is that the Reserves must eventually get independence. I know why the hon. the Minister is now putting in the word &#x201C;possible&#x201D; independence. The Prime Minister extended an invitation to all the Reserves during the last session of Parliament for them to ask for independence. He wants them to ask for independence for the obvious reason that it is fundamental to Government policy that the Reserves must get their independence. But nobody has reacted. The Chief Minister of the Transkei said that he does not want independence until his State is viable. The only state that can possibly ask for independence at this stage and who can possibly accept the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s invitation is the Transkei. There is no other Reserve which can. But the Transkei said that they are not going to ask for it now because they will have to wait until they are viable. If one has to wait until the Transkei is viable before they can ask for independence it will never be independent. Now, Sir, the Transkei have not responded to the appeal made by the Chief Minister. Now, I submit that is why this hon. Minister used the words &#x201C;possible independence&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to the Bantu Authorities Act, which was passed in 1951. He referred to the fact that this Act had been opposed by certain persons inside and outside this House. I want to remind him that when that Act was passed, it definitely did not apply to the Transkei, because the Transkei would not have it at that time. They did not want the type of authority which the Government was proposing to grant to the rest of the country. The Minister will remember that. Eventually a different type of authority was applied to the Transkei.</p>

<p>I am not now talking about the granting of self-government.

I want to point out that the Government itself knew that it was not acceptable to certain of the Bantu tribes.</p>
