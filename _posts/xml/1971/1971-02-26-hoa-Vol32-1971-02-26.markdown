<heading>COMMITTEE ON EMOLUMENTS OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission I should like to make an announcement. From time to time representations are made to increase the salaries and allowances of hon. members. It is maintained that hon. members are inadequately remunerated, bearing in mind their responsibilities, work and expenses. They are of course placed in the invidious position of having to vote themselves increases. There also appears to be a peculiar attitude adopted by some newspapers and sections of the public. They accept the principle of a fair day&#x2019;s pay for a fair day&#x2019;s work for everybody except Members of Parliament. They remind me of certain religious sects which firmly believe that to be a good worker for the Lord, the preacher must just about starve.</p>

<p>Consequently, after discussions with the Official Opposition, it has been decided to follow the same procedure as was followed in 1961, namely to appoint a special committee of prominent businessmen to inquire into and to make recommendations in regard to members&#x2019; salaries and allowances. The committee will consist of Mr. Fred Bamford, Chairman of S.A. Manganese, former Chairman of Safmarine and director of numerous other companies, and Dr. J. G. van der Horst, Managing Director of the Old Mutual. The committee, whose report will be laid before Parliament, will have the following terms of reference:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. To inquire into and report upon the emoluments and allowances of Cabinet Ministers, Deputy Ministers, office-bearers and Members of Parliament in view of their work and responsibilities and the conditions which apply to their service;</li>

<li>2. to compare such emoluments and allowances with those payable at the time of the foundation of the Union and thereafter; and</li>

<li>3. to establish whether it is necessary or desirable to alter these emoluments and allowances, and, if so, to recommend in each case what these should be.</li>

</ol>

<p>The meetings of the committee will be held in a room in the House of Assembly portion of the Parliamentary Buildings, and a circular will be issued to hon. members informing them of the procedure to be followed should they desire to give evidence before the committee. The first meeting of the committee will be held on Monday, 8th March. The secretary of the committee will be Mr. McFarlane, the Secretary to the House of Assembly.</p>

<p>Mr Speaker, I move&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, there is a fundamental difference in the approach of the two main parties in this country to the question of relations between the White group and the other race groups. Obviously I am not permitted now to discuss the attitude of the Government towards the Coloureds and the Indians, so I have to deal only with the one group, the Bantu, who are affected by this Bill.</p>

<p>Sir, the Government&#x2019;s policy, as it has often been stated by Government members including the Prime Minister, is one of self-determination. We differ as to what can be meant by self-determination. I questioned the hon. the Prime Minister last session as to what it meant and pointed out that the words could mean that these different groups would themselves determine what their future is to be. The Prime Minister made it quite clear that the only determination they have is separation; that the Bantu would not be allowed to determine that their way of life is to be part of South Africa: to stay a part of South Africa and to take part in the government of South Africa. I say therefore that when the Government speaks of self-determination it is senseless because the term does not mean what it should mean. It is only <span class="col_1709-1710" refersTo="page_0868"/>self-determination in so far as the Government determines that they will be separated from the rest of the Republic. They can develop only in one way and that is to eventual independence, and on those conditions the Government will allow the Bantu to determine how they are going to develop. As I say, they have no choice, and when the Minister tells us that the different Bantu nations, as he calls them&#x2014; we say they are not; they are different peoples&#x2014;the different groups in the different reserves have accepted the measure now before the House, we say that they accept it only because they have no other choice. What other choice have they, Sir&#x003F; The Minister presents them with this measure and they take it. Naturally. So would I if I were an African; I would take it. Because they have nothing else to take. If they do not take this they get nothing. If they do not accept the Government&#x2019;s offer to establish Bantu authorities in the first instance, they will get no development, and that has been proved in the case of Zululand compared with the Transkei. It is no secret that when Bantu from other parts of South Africa are taken to the Transkei, they are shown by the Transkeians themselves what they are achieving. They are told that unless you accept separate development you get nothing but if you accept separate development, then look what you will get. These other Bantu races or tribes are therefore compelled to accept this or else they get nothing.</p>

<p>The Minister has read out some letters to show that they are glad to have this Bill and that they accept it. I wonder how much they know about the contents of this Bill. The same thing happened when the Transkei Constitution Bill was presented to us; we were told that the Transkeians themselves had prepared that Bill. We did not accept that: they did it on the advice of the then Prime Minister. I wonder, Sir, if they are satisfied to leave it to the Minister to decide how, for instance their legislative assemblies are to be constituted, and how their executive is going to be constituted. You see. Sir, when the Transkei Constitution Bill was presented to us provision was made in the Act for an elected and representative legislative assembly, with representatives of the chiefs, and also for an elected executive. But in this Bill that we now have before us there is no such provision. The State President, by proclamation, will decide how these legislative assemblies will be constituted and how the executive will be constituted, so I do not know how the Minister can tell us that all these different Territorial Authorities have advised him that this is what they want and that they are so pleased to accept this when they do not even know what type of assembly they are going to have. Perhaps the Minister has told them what he intends doing. If so, I think he should tell this House what he has told them and how he is going to constitute these different bodies.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, I want to know what the position is with regard to money matters. Are they satisfied with the provision made here for contributions to their revenue&#x003F; In terms of this Bill their Executive will submit estimates to this Minister who, in consultation with the Minister of Finance, will determine how much our Exchequer will contribute towards their administrative expenses.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>What is wrong with that&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I say that this is wrong. We criticized this in the Transkei Constitution Bill too when that measure was passed, because everything is being left to the Minister of Finance and this Minister. This Parliament will be allowing them to decide how much to give the different Authorities: they alone will decide how much to give the Transkei, for instance, or Zululand or any other reserve which becomes self-governing. Sir, this may be the cause of friction, because if the Bantu submit their estimates and they decide to embark on a certain programme which does not accord with the political ideas of our Minister of Bantu Administration, he and the Minister of Finance can say: &#x201C;No, we are not giving you this money; we will not allow you to develop in that way; we will tighten the purse strings.&#x201D;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Is there any difference between this Bill and the Transkei Constitution Bill&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>No, and as far as I know there has been no difference of opinion yet between the Transkeian Government and the present Government; they work in accord. But supposing the Opposition party took over the government of the Transkei and wanted to have White development in the Transkei; supposing <span class="col_1711-1712" refersTo="page_0869"/>they wanted to build extra roads down to the coast, for instance, to allow White entrepreneurs to open up hotels to attract tourists and this did not accord with the policy of the Minister. He will say, &#x201C;No, I am sorry, I am not going to give you the money to do that; you will have to cut down expenditure; you will have to reduce your estimates; I will only give you so much&#x201D;. That is going to cause resentment in the mind of the other government and they are going to say to their people, &#x201C;The Government of the Republic is responsible for our lagging behind in development; it is because they will not agree to our spending money on certain developments which we think are necessary&#x201D;. That can cause friction between the two Governments, and in fact between the two states. I say it is wrong for us to include a provision of this nature in this Bill and we said so at the time when the Transkei Constitution Act was passed.</p>

<p>I should like to know whether these other authorities who accept this Bill approve of the schedule which sets out the matters they can deal with. Section 2 deals with Bantu education. They can control Bantu education provided that the study and training courses, syllabuses, teaching methods, medium of instruction and public examinations prescribed in terms of any law shall be prescribed in consultation with the Minister. Now we know what is meant by &#x201C;in consultation with the Minister&#x201D;, because the Minister told us the other day. It means that he has to concur. Unless he agrees, they cannot take any action they would like under the powers given to them to control education. I want to know whether the other bodies which were consulted, Zululand and the other Territorial Authorities, were agreeable to have this restriction placed on them when the Transkei has no such restriction. You see, in terms of the Transkei Constitution Act the Transkei Government can control education in the area falling under the jurisdiction of the Transkei. The districts are mentioned, but there is no other restriction. There is a feeling, of course, among the Africans that the Government is now taking this step here to restrict them in their administration because of what has happened in the Transkei, because the Transkei Government has taken a resolution that the medium of instruction after a certain standard shall be in either of the official languages, which is decided by the school board. We know the school boards all picked English to be the medium of instruction. Is that why the Government has put this restriction in this Constitution now before us&#x003F; I want to know what the reason for it is. Has the Transkei disappointed the Government in any way&#x003F; Has the Transkei acted contrary to the policy of the Government&#x003F; Why was the Transkei given the wide powers which are now denied to these bodies which will be established under this Bill before us&#x003F;</p>

<p>I say there will be further causes for dispute, and that is because of the very wide description of the areas to be controlled by these different Assemblies. We pointed out in the Second Reading and in the Committee Stage that in terms of this Bill before us now the Minister is embarking on a course of constitutional development which will eventually lead to complete separation and he is embarking on it without defining the areas where this will take place. He says it is defined by the Land and Trust Act of 1936, which lays down the scheduled and released areas, but in terms of clause 26 of the Bill before us now the State President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare an area as defined from time to time.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Then what is your argument&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I say that members on that side of the House are being foolish to allow the Minister to take powers like this. Those hon. members&#x2019; constituents will not be consulted when the Minister embarks on this course and hon. members opposite are now giving this Minister power to include practically any area adjacent to the Reserves in the area which can become self-governing and eventually independent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>But we have faith and trust in the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear that, because that hon. member, although he does not sit in a front bench, is an important member and he is a member of the Bantu Affairs Select Committee. I am glad to hear him saying that the members on <span class="col_1713-1714" refersTo="page_0870"/>that side are handing over their rights in trust to the Minister; they are abrogating and giving up their rights and abdicating from their duties and responsibilities and giving them over in trust to the Minister. They may trust this Minister, but how do they know that they can trust the next Minister&#x003F; How do they know who will be the next Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x003F; It might not even be a Nationalist, and in a few years&#x2019; time it will not be a Nationalist. What will they say then&#x003F; They are trusting the electorate because they know that this Government will probably not have time to embark on independence and that this Bill will never be put into effect by a United Party Government. That is the trust they have.</p>

<p>To get back to the boundaries, it is idle for the Minister and the hon. member for Aliwal to try to convince the country that the boundaries were laid down in 1936. The Minister himself knows that there is uncertainty and that there is trouble in the farming areas bordering on the Native Reserves. Only about a month ago the Chairman of the Nationalist Party in Komga moved a resolution before the Farmers&#x2019; Association asking the Government to include Komga in the Transkei so that they could buy their farms. That was the Chairman of the Nationalist Party and he knows it can be done under the 1936 Act. Where land is adjacent to Trust land, the Government can buy it and it then becomes Trust land. If the Chairman of the Nationalist Party can make a move like that, surely there must be an impression amongst Nationalists that the Government can go on buying land alongside Trust land.</p>

<p>Sir, what was the dispute between the Progressives and the United Party&#x003F; Why did the Progressives break away from the United Party&#x003F; They have forgotten the reason now, but the reason then was the purchase of land for Bantu without the Government telling us where the boundaries of the Reserves would be. The resolution taken by our Congress at Bloemfontein then was that money should not be given for buying any more land to extend the Bantu Reserves unless the Government told us where the boundaries of the Reserves were to be. We were not opposed to buying more land, but we objected to the buying of land without telling the public where the boundaries would be, especially as the Government was embarking on a policy of independence for these various homelands.</p>

<p>How does the Government acquire further land for the Bantu&#x003F; They can do it, as I pointed out, under the Bantu Trust Act. They can buy in the scheduled areas and they can buy in the released areas, and then they can buy land abutting on land owned by the Trust. When the Transkei Constitution was passed the area was defined, as to which district would fall under the jurisdiction of the Transkeian Government. But even there&#x2014;and we opposed it&#x2014;there was provision that the State President could by proclamation add land, and he could add on land referred to in section 25 of the Native Administration Act of 1927, which provides that other land may be acquired by the Trust on approval by this Parliament. It could be acquired by proclamation, but it had to be approved by this Parliament, and we know that is how Mdantsane near East London was acquired. The point is that other land can be acquired, and once it has been acquired by this Government with their majority we know that their members will never disapprove of anything that their Cabinet or that Minister does. What could also be added to the Transkei was land of which the Trust was the registered owner. So the Trust could buy land abutting on to the Transkei and then hand that over to the Transkei. Then there was also provision for adding Native locations as defined in the Natives Taxation Act. That Act has since been repealed, but it was inserted in the Transkei Constitution, and as far as I know this particular section has been retained. So we have all these problems before us and there is this uncertainty about what is going to be done. Hon. member opposite are abdicating their responsibilities by giving unheard of powers to this Minister. No other democracy would allow one Minister to decide which areas of their respective countries were to be dismembered. The hon. the Minister says that he cannot grant independence to a territorial authority or assembly without coming back to this Parliament for the final phase, because although independence is mentioned in the Preamble it is not mentioned in the Bill itself. That is quite true. But then we also have it from him that once he embarks on the course of constitutional development which he now proposes, it would be immoral to go back on it. The hon. the Minister himself said that it could not be stopped and that the point of no return has been reached. When we pass this Bill and give the hon. the Minister <span class="col_1715-1716" refersTo="page_0871"/>the powers to proclaim certain areas for self-government we are embarking on a course which, in his own terms, cannot be stopped and which will end up in independence for these states.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister in justifying this says that it is the traditional policy of South Africa. We have pointed out that this was not the traditional policy. We pointed out that Gen. Hertzog made a speech in 1913 in which he said that the Bantu would be separated but remain under the control of the Central Government. When the hon. the Minister quoted from a speech made by Gen. Hertzog in 1925, in which he talked of separation but did not deal with independence, the Minister says that they were not thinking in those terms at that time. But because they were not thinking in those terms and did not mention it particularly, the hon. the Minister says that we must now accept it as the traditional policy. Gen. Botha thought of it in 1913. I quoted his remarks which he made in this House in 1913. He then referred to &#x201C;afsondering&#x201D; and &#x201C;afskeiding&#x201D;. &#x201C;Afskeiding&#x201D;, that is segregation, he said would be as foolish as &#x201C;gelykstelling&#x2019; or equality. He supported &#x201C;afsondering&#x201D; and made it quite clear that it would be under the control of the Central Government.</p>

<p>Gen. Smuts, after the war, made it clear that in his opinion segregation was dead because of the development that had taken place, you could no longer have segregation. After all segregation means complete separation. We support separation but not this segregation which is now proposed and which was opposed by Generals Botha, Hertzog and Smuts. I again want to remind the people of this country that fragmentation, that is, this form of segregation, which is now proposed was only thought of by Dr. Verwoerd. He was the first leader who offered to carry this out.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister keeps on asking what our policy will be. We have stated our policy so often before that I am surprised that he still asks for it. I do not know why he does so. But there seems to be some sort of confusion. When we speak about a certain measure of self-government we have made it quite clear what we mean by giving the Africans in the reserves and in the urban areas a certain measure of self-government to control their own affairs. My Leader made that clear. It has often been repeated in this House, namely that they can develop constitutionally towards the powers that are given to provincial councils and even beyond. We made it quite clear. And yet, even in the Press &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>We will decide at the time how far to go. As long as they remain subservient to the Central Parliament, the development will take place gradually. It is for instance our policy to allow them to control their own townships. We are not just going to hand over the townships to them straightaway and tell them that they can administer the townships themselves. We know that that would not be fair. It may be disastrous too. This Minister is now going to take over the townships and administer them himself.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has introduced a Bill with which we will probably deal next week, in which he allows the freer movement of Africans in White areas to seek employment. This is a change in their policy. He allows them to move from one area to another and protects their rights under section 10. All this is proof of the fact that they accept that they will never get rid of all the Africans who are living in the White areas. They have to cater for the Africans who are born there every day and who have rights under section 10. These are people who have no connection with the reserves and will never have any connection with them. They are the people who are not catered for in this Bill we have before us now. They are not catered for by the Government&#x2019;s policy, and that is where we differ. We say that this is no solution because it does not cater for the main problem this Government has, and that is the permanently urbanized African, and the majority of Africans fall into this category. This Government just tries to close its eyes to the fact that they are there.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. C. BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>They are. Just look at the latest census figures. In October, <span class="col_1717-1718" refersTo="page_0872"/>1962, Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, who was then the Cape Leader of the Nationalist Party, gave a New Year&#x2019;s address to his followers in the Cape. He said then that the Government was embarking upon a five-year plan for the development of the reserves. With that development, he said, was a move to entice the Africans back from the Western Cape to the reserves. What success have they had in enticing them back, Sir&#x003F; The only Africans who go back to the reserves are those who are sent back. They are not enticed back on their own. I came across an example recently, where an African had to go back to school in Umtata because he could not get the education he wanted here. To pass his Matric he had to go back to Umtata. Because they go back for a few years and leave the area in which they are born, they lose their protection under section 10. That is the way the Government is getting them back to the reserves. They are not going back of their own accord. I suppose the Minister or the member now sitting behind him, being advised, is going to ask us what we are going to do, seeing that the Government has already embarked upon this policy and has granted the Africans certain authority. I repeat that the development which takes place may be in line with our policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Transkei reduced his argument to the one question to which not <span class="col_1719-1720" refersTo="page_0873"/>the National Party but, indeed, the United Party has to provide the answer, i.e. how do they see the further political development of the Bantu living in the peri-urban areas of our cities and who, in terms of the policy of the National Party, will be living in the homeland of the White man&#x003F; How do they see the development of that individual&#x003F; I shall come back to this.</p>

<p>First of all I want to congratulate the Progressive Party on having been courageous enough to admit the success of the view the National Party takes of its multinational task. It has succeeded to the extent of having penetrated even to the Progressive Party. To be specific, they have discovered that a population unit called the Afrikaners does exist and they have decided to distribute prizes in the future for the edification of that population unit. We look forward to the happy day when the hon. member for Houghton will make a speech in Afrikaans in this House. The development we have seen up to this day, as far as the policy of the National Party is concerned, is a logical one, one which is in keeping with all legislation which this party has piloted through Parliament since 1948. The United Party, on the other hand, is still engaged in adapting to this development, but they do not want to admit this. The Progressive Party, however, has been realistic enough to realize that this policy is succeeding and that they will never be able to restore the <i>status quo,</i> as it existed before this party came into power. Hence the following, virtually historically drastic resolution which was passed by the Progressive Party&#x2014;and I think it may be as well for us to place it on record. At their most recently held congress that party resolved&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the party show clearly in our information to the public that we are fully aware of changing circumstances in our country and that our policies are geared to these changes. As an example we should extend to Bantustans the same principles and values we intend to apply in the whole Republic and we emphasize that the development of these entities will present no constitutional difficulties in our proposed federal scheme.</block>

<p>Let us take cognizance of the words &#x201C;proposed federal scheme&#x201D;. These are not unknown words to us. They describe in effect the same basis as that on which the United Party wants to offer a solution to the South African situation. This becomes more evident from what was intimated by Dr. Zac de Beer as well, a leading member of the Progressive Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Progressive Party could find common ground with the Nationalists in the development of the homelands. Thereafter a progressive federal type policy could be adopted &#x2026;</block>

<p>What opportunism are we now finding on the part of the Progressive Party&#x003F; Up to now our standpoint was diametrically opposed to theirs; we knew exactly where we were standing with them. But here we have opportunism in its purest form&#x2014;on the one hand they are moving closer to the National Party and at the same time they are also moving in the direction of the United Party with its federal idea.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>They pose a political threat. The danger of their thinking is concealed in the words &#x201C;that we should extend to Bantustans the same principles and values we intend applying in the whole Republic&#x201D;. These values remain constant and the rest is the bait to the electorate of South Africa. The hook, however, is concealed in the &#x201C;same values&#x201D; which remain constant and are concealed in their concept of multi-racialism. This is the sting in the thinking of that party.</p>

<p>Now in the United Party we find the interesting trend that some of its members are thinking along the same lines as the Progressive Party. We must ask ourselves whether this is a matter of chance. And here we should have regard to the fact that the lines along which the hon. member for Kensington was thinking, as is clearly evidenced from the approach he adopted in his newspaper before he became a member of this House, are Progressive and that that newspaper disparages an hon. member for whom this side of the House has high regard, i.e. the hon. member for Zululand, whenever he makes the slightest error in the eyes of the Progressives.</p>

<p>In this we see a pattern of disparaging people on that side of this House who have leadership potential but who advocate ideas which are, in <span class="col_1721-1722" refersTo="page_0874"/>so far as this is still possible, unadulterated and true to their old trend of thought. On the other hand we find the rise of people on that side of this House with leanings towards the Progressive Party. They find the point of contact in their common approach which is made up of their having to maintain the <i>status quo</i> of the National Party and developing from there. That is where the sting is to be found, because their basic approach&#x2014;absolutely equal rights&#x2014;integration&#x2014;still remains the same. I want to indicate how the trend of thought of the United Party has changed and how it is nevertheless assuming a pattern. On 27th May, 1959 (Hansard, column 6687), the Leader of the Opposition said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is the clause which provides that for the purposes of this Act, the Bantu population shall consist of certain national units. We all know that national units exist; the Bill does not bring them into operation.</block>

<p>He went on to elaborate on this. The standpoint of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at that stage was that in the interests of White South Africa alone it was not a good thing to recognize these population units. His objection was to the statutory recognition of that trend of thought. This side of the House, on the other hand, concerned itself with the realities of the situation and acted accordingly. Then the ideas of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were evidently stimulated by an interplay of ideas within the ranks of his own party and they started to realize that by recognizing the factual situation of national units they were going to land themselves in difficulties. Then the next interesting phase of that Party&#x2019;s approach dawned. This is evident from the words of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this House (Hansard, 1961, column 7559)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hitherto we have still been inclined to speak of national unity with reference to the two White sections of the population only, but it is quite clear that unless steps are taken to create a common patriotism amongst all sections of the population&#x2014;it does not matter what their race is&#x2014;we shall never be able to achieve unity and nationhood in the true sense of the word.</block>

<speech by="#coetsee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me silence that hon. member once and for all. The hon. member himself has never reflected on that question he has just put. What was passing through his mind before he put that question&#x003F; He was thinking this: The solution of the National Party to the situation in the Republic has succeeded. It has succeeded, and he knows that this is so, hence his question, &#x201C;What about the Coloureds&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p>On 24th April, 1962, the hon. member for Durban North said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The difference in approach stems from our belief that South Africa is a multiracial nation.</block>

<p>In other words, here we see the continuation of the change of mind of the Leader of the Opposition. Now, as we are making rapid progress, so the United Party has to find a solution. They are still thinking; there still is an interplay of ideas in their ranks. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is setting about this task in a creative way, because he realizes that his party is becoming an antiquated party. He is beginning to see the same solution as the one the Progressive Party is seeing&#x2014;I do not know who has seen it first. In column 2174 of Hansard, 1970, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am prepared to accept that we are a multi-national country.</block>

<p>In this process of the political development of the homelands, in which each national unit is getting its particular place in our country intended for it in terms of the National Party view, words are of the utmost importance. [Interjections.] I am not saying that that party has changed its standpoint; I am merely outlining the trends within the party. The hon. member then continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We accept the fact fully, and we admit that multi-nationality presents us with certain problems. We admit that there is diversity, and we admit that a position has to be created where people will be able to realize themselves without the one dominating the other.</block>

<p>But on the other hand the hon. member for East London City told us in this House at the same time that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1723-1724" refersTo="page_0875"/>There is an unbridgeable chasm because, as far as national policy is concerned, there is so great a difference between the two parties that it just isn&#x2019;t true. We do not want to accept that this is a multi-national country. As far as we are concerned, it is a multi-racial country.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, these are not coincidences. At one stage we thought these were coincidences, but they are not; they indicate an interplay of ideas which have not been reconciled within that party.</p>

<p>As regards the view of that side of this House as to how the political development of the Bantu homelands or the reserves should be in contradistinction to the view of the National Party, I should like to quote the following. It is very relevant here for the simple reason that this Bill takes us so far from the point of departure that I want to make the statement that the United Party will not be able to restore the <i>status quo</i> to what it used to be before the National Party commenced its constitutional programme. I want to quote what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said here last year&#x2014;and I am going to do so with his permission. After I had put a question to him, he invited me to put the question to him in writing (Hansard, col. 5404). I did that and indicated that in my opinion the debate on this Bill was a reasonable opportunity for replying to that question as well as other interesting related questions. The question I wanted to put and which I then forwarded to him in writing, concerned the statement that the United Party would develop the reserves and would give to each one the maximum autonomy which each area could achieve. Sir, I want to tell you that it was a very realistic question at that stage because we were living in the time of an election; the United Party was forming cabinets at that time; they had great expectations, and one would have expected their Bantu policy to have been formulated to such an extent at that stage that if they were to assume the reins of government, that policy could immediately be carried into effect. In other words, they should have been prepared as regards this one major matter with which we occupy ourselves year in and year out. I then put the following question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is the concept of &#x201C;each area&#x201D; a geographic concept or do you give it an ethnic content as well, and what factors will determine such an area in each case&#x003F;</block>

<p>In other words, will it be prescribed by the traditional occupation of an area by a specific tribe; will recognition be given to the Venda and Tswana, etc., as population units&#x003F; I added the following related question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What factors and who will determine whether a particular area has achieved its maximum autonomy&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, the United Party tells us that it is within their power to assure for all times the goodwill of the Bantu. When they now decide that maximum autonomy will go no further than a council equal to a provincial council or a council which will perform certain administrative functions on an agency basis, who is going to determine that&#x2014;the governing party of that time, the United Party&#x003F; Sir, the hon. members on the Opposite side who waxed so lyrical about young South Africa must start reflecting on this question and pose the following question to themselves in that process; If the United Party that will be in power at that time and will determine that maximum autonomy, placed that ceiling over the aspirations of that particular area which, and we should remember this, will have an ethnic content, unless they tell me that this will not be the case, will they be able to maintain that situation for all times without creating any dissatisfaction&#x003F;</p>

<p>The second question is this: Is it within the means and the development potential of the Black man in the Republic of South Africa to strive realistically after the achievement of the same political level of development as that which has been achieved by the White man&#x003F; Sir, I want to suggest that the answer must be &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, and if the answer is &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, the United Party cannot determine what the maximum content of the autonomy will be which they will grant to an area; they cannot do so. Then the third question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At what stage in the process of political development will an area be taken up into a federation&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, you must remember that it is the plan of the United Party to give the Bantu eight White representatives here. When this is coupled to an area which will enjoy autonomy, <span class="col_1725-1726" refersTo="page_0876"/>restricted or unrestricted, or qualified or unqualified, the question is: When will it be taken up into the federal system envisaged by the United Party&#x003F; Sir, you should always contrast this to the realistic approach of this side of the House, i.e. guiding the peoples to full autonomy, if necessary and if possible for them. The next question is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Will there be differences in the maximum autonomy which they will grant to different areas&#x003F; Is this possible&#x003F;</block>

<p>In other words, will they, in contrast to what we want to offer here, share out unequal autonomous authority to each area or to the different areas, and how will this be carried into effect&#x003F; Sir, in replying to this one has to have regard to the fairness and the justness of an approach such as that of the National Party in contrast to what the United Party will do.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. COETSEE</person>:</from>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, on what basis will representation in the federation be obtained if unequal political development of areas exists&#x003F; Surely they cannot grant area A, the development of which has not been the maximum according to them, the same representation as that granted to an area which has in fact shown no development ability as yet. Surely this cannot happen. In other words, what they are suggesting here as a solution is something which will not work in practice. It simply cannot work; it is impossible; otherwise they are erring in their statement that they will grant maximum autonomy. Surely this is logical.</p>

<p>For the edification of the hon. member for Orange Grove, the premise from which we proceeded was that we had now reached the stage so far removed from the point of departure of the political development in our country that that side of this House was obliged to reorientate itself. My further statement was that reorientation was only possible in the direction of the Progressive Party and my further deduction was that the Progressive Party had already put out its hand towards that reorientation.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I must admit that I have rather lost the trend of thought of the hon. member for Bloemfontein West. I tried my best to follow his somewhat tortuous logic, but halfway through I rather lost the thread. However, he did say one or two things which I feel I should at least contradict, because he clearly misunderstood the whole basis of a federal policy. [Interjection.] As I was saying, the hon. member tried to find some form of unity in the policies of the United Party of race federation and the Progressive Party policy of an ordinary geographic federation. They are completely different. The one visualizes a geographic content of areas linked together as our provinces are linked, but not by a unified Parliament like this one under Union, but under a federal system whereby every individual on a common roll basis who qualifies will have the vote and will therefore have a meaningful say in the political power structure of this country.</p>

<p>What is this geographic content&#x003F; il do not know how the hon. member can talk about a geographic content when it is all on a system of communal franchise. The race federation as such has nothing to do with geographic areas. There need be no provinces at all. The race federation is a federation of races in a Central Parliament on a communal basis. [Interjection.] I did hear what the hon. member said, but that still does not explain the meaning of race federation. The meaning of race federation is that the races are federated with some say in a Central Parliament on a communal basis, with eight White representatives of the African people, six possible&#x2014;I use this famous word, &#x201C;possible&#x201D;&#x2014;Coloured representatives for the Coloured people, two representatives, I think it is, for the Indian people, <span class="col_1727-1728" refersTo="page_0877"/>and the rest of the central race federal Parliament will consist of White members. That is the United Party&#x2019;s plan. There will be provinces in the ordinary way and they will have some autonomy as at present, but the actual running of the country will be done by a Central Parliament with the races represented communally, and therefore the races which are represented communally will in fact have no real say in the political power structure of the country.</p>

<p>Ours is completely different.

That could join our geographic federation, and I might say it is the only one I envisage as even being possible because of the fact that it is the only contiguous land area among all the Bantustans &#x2026; [Interjection ] &#x2026; but with political franchise granted to individuals irrespective of race on a qualified basis, so that the election of the Central Federal Parliament will be done by all the races on a common roll for everyone who qualifies for the vote.</p>

<p>The geographic content comes in the provinces which are given rights of autonomy.

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, of course, anybody will be able to buy land, and non-Whites will be able to buy land in the so-called White Republic. [Interjections.] We envisage South Africa as a multi-racial entity controlled by a Central Federal Parliament in which all individuals have the vote on a common roll&#x2014;that is the important thing&#x2014;so that they are not limited to eight representatives for the entire race.</p>

<p>The provinces will be allowed autonomy in their own areas in certain fields, and let me tell you it will be wider fields than at present and their rights will be entrenched. Then those people will be able to continue with the normal local government activities. [Interjection.] I know your policy only too well, and while I am on that point I might just mention this to the hon. member for Transkei as regards the resolution which was adopted at that notorious 1959 congress which led to our leaving the U.P., I might say it was the end of the line for us although there had been many other incidents before then, as the hon. member well knows, like the Coloured franchise and other incidents in the past which we managed to swallow. But this was the last straw. It was a thoroughly dishonest resolution which had nothing really to do with the independence or otherwise of the Bantustans because at least two-thirds of the land had already been acquired, and what were they going to do about that land which was going to the independent Bantustans&#x003F; So it rested on the remaining land which still had to be acquired, and the hon. member for South Coast saw this as a wonderful opportunity to persuade a few farmers in Natal to support the United Party in the forthcoming provincial election by saying, &#x201C;No more land for the Blacks; no more land for these independent Bantustans.&#x201D; And I might say that member after member of that party objected to that resolution including the Leader of the Opposition. Since the hon. member has raised it now, I would remind him that his own leader voted against that resolution at the congress. To return to our Federal policy, apparently the hon. member finds it difficult to understand. What is important in the political context is who controls the country ultimately. This Parliament will control it, the Federal Central Parliament, but the people represented here and their representatives in this Parliament will consist of the entire cross-section of the nation and not just small communal groups representing the various races, with minor representation for the largest group and enormous representation for one of the smaller minority groups, the White people.

<p>Yes, I am telling the United Party. Their independence cannot be revoked unless the State itself agrees willingly to revoke its own independence and to rejoin what was the Republic of South Africa. I may say that it is very likely that they would do so under our policy, because of the great exchange of rights they would get. They would then get a meaningful say in the Central Parliament, together with mobility and the removal of all racially discriminatory practices. If the hon. the Minister asks Chief Gatsha Buthelezi today whether he would choose an independent Zululand or a Zululand which would be a province of a federal system under a Progressive government, I know very well what he would say, and so does the hon. the Minister. I may say that this would probably apply in the Transkei as well, if a free vote were allowed and proclamation 400 were removed, because the majority vote was cast for a multi-racial South Africa when the first Transkeian Authority was set up.</p>

<p>They were entirely in favour of remaining a part of the Republic of South Africa.

We would then say: Come in if you wish to. If you come in, however, you come in on the same basis as the other provinces, or states, whatever you want to call them. You will be given the right to look after certain local governmental matters. You will vote on a qualified franchise basis. After that, it is up to them to choose.

<p>All right, as the population and the electorate increases, naturally one has to increase the size of the representation in this House. The main point I am trying to make is that our Africans are different. They have had decades of association with White people in a modern industrial economy. They no more want the standards that have been attained to drop than we want our standards to drop. They are fully aware of the fact that White people are not only necessary, they also desire them to stay and work with them in multi-racial harmony. It is as simple as that.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you. Sir. I say that tradition is a word which is bandied around this House all the time. I want to say one final thing to the hon. the Minister or to the House and that is that I am not frightened of non-White people. The people that frighten me are the people who have grievances. Because, when people have grievances, that is when trouble and violence occur. Those are the people that frighten me and not the non-White people as such at all. In fact, I am more frightened of violent White people in many respects. As I was saying, tradition is a word we often hear bandied around in this House. It is a marvellous excuse for retaining those things which one thinks fit in with one&#x2019;s current policy and for happily discarding the things which no longer suit one. For example, the Coloured franchise was a tradition in this country, but it was easily thrown over. Now, Sir, we suddenly have the tradition of the development of independent Bantustans. I have never seen in the history of South Africa that I have read, that that is part of the tradition of this country. It became a tradition of the Nationalist Party in latter years when they needed an ethical background to a policy which was not acceptable to the outside world or even to their own thinking intellectuals. Naked &#x201C;witbaas-skap&#x201D; was no longer acceptable. Dr. Verwoerd was intellectually superior enough to recognize that in the world of today naked &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; just would not go down. So came the idea of separate development instead of apartheid, even unto independent Bantustans. The whole thing was designed so that the Nationalist Party would have an ethical basis to put against the fact that it is steadily depriving African people of rights in the so-called White Republic of South Africa. That is the whole basis of the policy. It is the whole basis for all the constitutional changes which have been introduced, such as granting self-government, giving concessions, and promising possible independence. This has only been done so that they can say that those Africans, who remain in the White Republic of South Africa, are here as visitors or temporary sojourners only. They have no right to claim any right whatsoever. That is the whole basis. I am right, am I not&#x003F; &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;, says an hon. member, I am right.</p>

<p>Well, Sir this might have an ethical basis if the reserves or homelands could ever be viable, which they never can be. With all the will in the world and all the money in the world, they cannot be viable. There are not the job opportunities that will ever entice people back there. One can push them back. One can &#x201C;persuade&#x201D; them to go back. The Minister&#x2019;s Department is adept at &#x201C;persuading&#x201D; them to go back. They are told that they have no jobs or houses in the cities and that they will be arrested and so they are &#x201C;persuaded&#x201D; to go back. The hon. the Minister is adept at <span class="col_1737-1738" refersTo="page_0882"/>moving Black spots. The 200, 300 or 500 families involved every time he moves a Black spot, are nothing. However, when I asked him why he does not convert Soweto, where 1 million people live, into a homeland and thus solve all the problems of border industries on the Witwatersrand, just as he did with Mdantsane in East London, he goes white with shock. He goes white with shock at the thought of converting Soweto into a homeland. But it is just an accident of history that there was not a little tribe living outside Johannesburg, which in 1913 could have become a scheduled area or in 1936 could have become a released area. The hon. the Minister is a great empire builder. I suggest that he creates just a small homeland area in Soweto, so that he can swop it for a Black spot somewhere else. I will find a nice one in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Right, even there if he wishes. Let us put one there and let him call Soweto a homeland. That will solve an awful lot of problems for a lot of people, one million people in fact.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, this Bill offers no <i>quid pro quo.</i> None of these constitutional bills offer any <i>quid pro quo</i> to the people who have never lived in the reserves and to the people who will not be able to continue living there, because of sheer, grinding poverty. They do not come into town only to see the bright lights, as hon. members think. They come in because there is no employment for them in those reserves, and because they are living at a bare subsistence and below subsistence level. As long as that is the case, no laws will be able to keep those people out and no constitutional status will make any difference to their conditions. The hon. member for Brakpan threw up his hands in horror when the hon. member for Transkei said that there were more Africans living in the urban areas than in the homelands. He is not right in saying that.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not like the migratory system of labour on the mines or anywhere else. More than half of those, by the way, come from outside South Africa, which the hon. the Minister probably does not know. Nevertheless, I do not approve of the migratory labour system under any conditions. The hon. the Minister, who was on the United Party benches when this happened, should know that at one stage the mines in the Free State wanted to increase the number of permanently settled mineworkers. That was stopped by Dr. Verwoerd, who would not allow it. He forbade them to take any more than 2 per cent of the total mining forces as stable, settled people. The rest had to be migratory labour. Sir, if the Government would change its mind and allow settled labourers and, most important of all, if they had the courage to do what is being done <i>sub rosa</i> anyway, <span class="col_1739-1740" refersTo="page_0883"/>namely to lift the Mines and Works Act restrictions, we could at least reduce the number of migrants working on those mines. Concerning the Mines and Works Act restrictions, there was a commission of inquiry, which was hastily shelved when the Mineworkers Union raised its angry head, but in fact, these restrictions are being lifted <i>sub rosa</i> because not enough Whites are coming forward to be trained to keep this vital industry going. The lifting of those restrictions would be to everybody&#x2019;s advantage. It would be to South Africa&#x2019;s economic advantage, because we would be able to produce more gold economically because at the moment many jobs are classified as skilled, which are not skilled at all. There is a new South African word, namely &#x201C;de-skilling&#x201D;. As soon as Black people do these jobs, they are known as a de-skilled occupation. Let us de-skill some of the occupations on the mines. Then we will be able to do what the hon. the Minister for Tourism suggested.</p>

We have accepted that this may then have happened. I personally, I must say, have the greatest doubts about this. I do not believe for a moment that the Government is going to give independence.

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>We have been listening to a very interesting speech, that of the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;interesting since she has told us more of her policy and of the similarity which exists between the policy of her party and the policy being followed by the United Party.</p>

<p>What is interesting in her policy is that her party wants to deny the existence of the national ties of the Bantu&#x2014;in other words, she does not want to accept that separate Bantu peoples exist in South Africa; she does not want to admit that the Bantu in South Africa differ amongst one another on the basis of language, descent and culture; she does not want to admit that their aspirations differ and that they can come into conflict amongst themselves. But surely she has been in a position of gaining first hand knowledge of conflict between Bantu peoples. After all, recently she paid a visit to Zambia and had a discussion with Kaunda. He probably told her of his problems, ones arising from the tribal basis. What we are having a manifestation of in Zambia we shall find in South Africa, too, if we deny the existence of the national ties of the Bantu and give all of them the vote on a common voters&#x2019; roll. In terms of the policy of the hon. member for Houghton everyone within the borders of South Africa will vote on a common voters&#x2019; roll. This means that there will be a preponderance of numbers on the side of the non-Whites. This ratio she wants to upset even further by saying that under their policy Lesotho and the other Bantu states bordering on South Africa will also be invited to share in that common voters&#x2019; roll. This will mean a voters&#x2019; roll which will be predominantly Black with merely a handful of Whites, to use her own term.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of her policy, as it was stated by the new leader of the party, is that they want to gain the support of the Afrikaner, especially of the young Afrikaner, for their party. I can give the hon. member for Houghton the assurance that with their policy they do not have the slightest chance of getting the young Afrikaner to vote for them. The young Afrikaner of today is a person with ideals. He will not allow his people to set out on a course of suicide. It is very clear that the hon. member and her party are completely out of contact with the thinking of the young Afrikaner of today. We, on the other hand, are convinced that the young Afrikaner of today, the leader of the future, is prepared, able and inspired to take our task in the years which lie ahead to its logical consequences on the foundation we are laying here now. The logical consequence thereof is independence for the various Bantu states.</p>

<p>I should like to dwell for another moment on the difference between the United Party and the Progressive Party. The United Party says its policy is one of race federation. The Progressive Party, on the other hand, says its race federation policy <span class="col_1741-1742" refersTo="page_0884"/>has a geographic content. Here it is really difficult for me to see the difference. As I see it, the difference is that the one calls its policy a race federation whereas the other calls it a federation of states. However, to me this seems to be the same thing in practice. Under the policies of both the non-White will have the vote. The Progressive Party says the non-White may vote for whomsoever he wishes&#x2014;White or non-White; the United Party says the non-White will be represented by Whites, but only for the immediate future&#x2014;we can have no doubt about that. Are they in earnest in thinking that by giving the Bantu eight representatives they will satisfy the political aspirations of non-White South Africa&#x003F; On what is the policy of the National Party based if not on a recognition of the human dignity of the non-White peoples of South Africa&#x003F; What other meaning does it have except that we are admitting that other people are the same as us and consequently also have political aspirations and therefore must have the right to strive after and realize those political aspirations&#x003F; What opportunities is the United Party creating for the non-White&#x003F;</p>

<p>Forget about the Coloureds for the moment. The fact that the hon. member always resorts to the Coloureds is an admission, as was said by the hon. member for Bloemfontein West, of the fact that our policy with regard to the development of the Bantu is the right one, that we are on the right road. It is because the hon. member for Turffontein feels that we are not following the same road with regard to the Coloureds that he is always throwing the Coloured question in our teeth. At the moment, however, we are dealing with the development of the Bantu homelands and not with the Coloured question. At the moment we are discussing the development of the Bantu homelands; that is what this debate is about. Can we deny for one moment that the Bantu peoples, too, have political aspirations&#x003F; The hon. member for Transkei must admit this; surely he cannot deny this&#x2014;the Bantu, too, do have political aspirations and as we make progress in our dispensation for them, so those political aspirations will crystallize more and more. In what way will those political aspirations be fully realized under the policy of the United Party, except in the way that the non-White will have to fight to realize them&#x003F; Basically the difference between the policy of the United Party and that of the National Party is that under the policy of the United Party each non-White will have to fight for what he wants; under our policy, on the other hand, each non-White can get what he wants when the moment arrives for him to have it.</p>

<p>The urban Bantu, too, can definitely get his political rights.

Because it seems to me, if I am interpreting and reading this quotation correctly, that the interest which the United Party is, in fact, showing in the Bantu at this stage is due only to the fact that the Bantu is a source of labour. The United Party sees him merely as a means of making money for them and of making money for South Africa. Sir, the non-White in South Africa, the non-White of the homelands and the non-White of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland sell their labour here in South Africa. He cannot find a livelihood elsewhere.

<heading>TIMBER REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORESTATION</heading>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is perhaps a good thing that we are stopping the previous debate for a while so that we can come back to the actualities of our country and so that we can discuss matters that are going to be of great importance to us all in the future.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to move the motion standing in my name, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the anticipated shortage of timber, this House requests the Government to consider positive steps to make the country as self-sufficient as possible as far as its timber requirements are concerned by undertaking State afforestation on a more extensive scale and encouraging the private sector to do likewise by the granting of financial assistance.</block>

<p>Sir, you will notice that this motion proposes that the Government should take purposeful steps to make the Republic self-sufficient as far as its timber requirements are concerned. Although I am placing the emphasis here on self-sufficiency, I do not for one moment want to forget the value of the large export potential of timber products. I just want to point out that wattle <span class="col_1745-1746" refersTo="page_0886"/>bark earns R8 million and that other products such as pulp, fibreboard, cardboard and processed wood already earns a further R30 million. In looking at the international position of timber we find that the use of timber is increasing tremendously. Figures prove that the world&#x2019;s use of timber doubles every 20 years. We find this increase in the use of timber despite the use of substitutes such as plastic materials. We can therefore take it that the use of timber will increase. We also find this upward trend in the use of timber in South Africa, and I do not think that this is solely because we are having an upsurge in the building industry. I think we can accept the fact that the upward trend has come to stay. It is therefore necessary for us to take another look at our whole timber industry and at its future here in South Africa.</p>

<p>During 1967 a very important committee of inquiry was appointed, the Committee of Investigation into Private Forestry in South Africa. The committee was under the chairmanship of the present Secretary for Forestry, Mr. Malherbe. Sir, I regard the committee&#x2019;s report as very important for the timber industry, and I should just like to quote the terms of reference of this committee to the House, because I think that we are still going to refer back a great deal to its work&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To investigate and make recommendations on (a) the manner in which reliable surveys of the country&#x2019;s commercial timber resources can be undertaken and the requirements for attaining continuity in the collection, processing and release of statistical data on the timber-growing industry; (b) the manner in which the country&#x2019;s timber demands can be assessed and the requirements for attaining continuity in the collection, processing and release of statistical data on timber demands; (c) the co-ordination of timber supply and demand; (d) the manner in which sound management and orderly production and marketing can be attained in the private timber-growing industry; (e) improved co-operation in the forest and timber industry; (f) forest taxation; (g) provision of financial facilities as a means of assisting and encouraging private forestry &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the point I should like to come back to at a later stage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(h) land use and ownership of private plantations; (i) the desirability and the nature of legislation considered necessary to give effect to any of the committee&#x2019;s recommendations, especially in enabling the private timber-growing industry to operate on a sound basis.</block>

<p>I regard the findings of this committee as very important, but I cannot refer to all of them; I just want to mention here that it was concerned with the co-ordination of supply and demand, about which they made very important recommendations; it was concerned with research, marketing, soil conservation, the prices of timber, the grading of timber, the forming of co-operative societies of timber producers and co-operation between timber producers and the Department of Forestry; it was concerned with taxation, and the committee made important recommendations in connection with estate duty on timber plantations; it was concerned with the use of land and also with legislation. In 1968 we obtained the amended Forestry Act in which a considerable number of these recommendations were beneficially included, and which I shall come back to at a later stage. But in paragraph 110 of their recommendations we find a small section that I should like to quote to the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To achieve a higher tempo of afforestation in South Africa and realizing that finance is one of the main factors influencing the position, the Committee recommends that as a matter of urgency the Government should make available loans at low rates of interest for the establishment and maintenance of plantations.</block>

<p>In an appendix to the report very definite guiding lines are laid down about further action in respect of this matter, and there was a discussion about the kind and extent of the loans that ought to be granted, the interest and the terms, the administrative assistance that can be given to producers and the necessary supervision, taxes, insurance and, lastly the subsidizing of such loans.</p>

<p>This principle of the subsidizing of plantations is not a new one. It is done in other countries because the long period one has to wait for one&#x2019;s money and the large capital expenditure do not easily make it profitable for a private owner, particularly if he still has to purchase land on which <span class="col_1747-1748" refersTo="page_0887"/>to establish a plantation. We find examples of this assistance in Finland, for instance, where the State grants loans for the reafforestation of unproductive and devastated land. We find a very good example in France, where the most successful scheme was applied. The Natural Forestry Fund grants a 100 per cent loan on afforestation, on which they pay only a 50 per cent to 80 per cent subsidy, and they give that money to the producer at an interest rate of &#x00BC; per cent to 1 per cent. We also have it in England. There we have the &#x201C;Approved Woodland Scheme and Dedication Scheme&#x201D;, in which the government, if the owner binds himself to plant and to tend trees according to a fixed programme, gives him an annual grant and also helps him with the establishment of plantations. We can therefore see the importance with which other countries regard their plantations. If the recommendations of the committee are implemented, there ought to be no danger that misuse will be made of this financial assistance. Such an owner will have to administer his forests according to properly drawn-up plans.</p>

<p>But let us now first look at what the Republic&#x2019;s timber position is, because it is important for us to conduct a survey. We find that in 1969 there were 1,150,000 hectares of afforested land in the Republic. 190,000 hectares of that was indigenous forest. We are very grateful and proud of the great care the State gives to our indigenous forests, and we are grateful that very great portions of this are in the possession of the State. They take care of its preservation and management, and I am glad the Department of Forestry has converted to a system in which the planned administration of these natural forests can make them more useful and more accessible to the public. We should like to ask that the State continue to administer our indigenous forests in this very sensible way. We must remain true to the slogan &#x201C;forests must remain forests&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I also want to make a further appeal for the planting by us of more indigenous trees. Even though an indigenous tree grows much more slowly than a non-indigenous one, it nevertheless has a very great value for us, not only the commercial value of the tree but also the embellishment and the pleasure it can give to man. That is why I want to ask that throughout the country we give much more attention to the planting of more indigenous trees and that we ensure that if necessary research will also be done, so that these trees can come into their own to a greater extent.</p>

<p>The remaining 960,000 hectares are established plantations. We find that 50 per cent of this is pinewood, 30 per cent gum trees and 20 per cent wattle; two-thirds of this timber is privately owned and one-third is owned by the State. In 1969, the latest figures tell us, we obtained the colossal amount of 7,650 million cubic metres of timber from these plantations. For the information of the House, which is not yet metricated to such an extent, I can just say that one cubic metre equals 35 cubic feet. Saw logs represent 28 per cent of the timber, pulp wood 37 per cent, mine timber 29 per cent and other timber 6 per cent.</p>

<p>Now, to what extent does this timber provide for our needs&#x003F; If we look at construction timber, we see that 85 per cent of our needs are met. In other words, we still have a shortage of 15 per cent. As far as plywood and veneer are concerned we still have a shortage of 38 per cent, 20 per cent in respect of paper pulp and cardboard needs and a tremendous shortage of 82 per cent in respect of timber cross-beams. As far as cross-beams are concerned, I believe that through research we can perhaps, be much more self-sufficient in the future. I understand that the Department is engaged in an intensive programme in that connection. As far as leaf-wood for the manufacture of furniture is concerned, we have a shortage of 70 per cent. There it will perhaps not be so easy to meet all our needs, but we must keep at it and I believe that our natural forests can provide more of this timber. As far as the other uses are concerned, for example poles, mine props, fibre board, soluble pulp, wooden containers, factory timber, firewood and wattle bark, we are already supplying 100 per cent of the needs.</p>

<p>In any case it is very clear that we still have a great shortage at present, and this position is not improving. It is therefore necessary for us to carry out prognosis studies of what the future needs will be, but it is not easy to carry out such studies without the proper figures. It is therefore important that in 1968 the Forest Act provided that data be collected from all producers of timber so that studies could be made for the future. When the then Minister of Forestry moved his policy motion in the Other Place in 1968, he drew a very clear picture. He mentioned there that a <span class="col_1749-1750" refersTo="page_0888"/>study by an independent consultant predicted that at the end of the century there would be an annual timber shortage of 16 million cubic metres. In the Forest Act of 1968 provision was made for proper stocktaking. Section 29 (2) (a) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister may make such regulations as he may consider necessary for the making and keeping of a comprehensive running survey of requirements in respect of forest produce in the Republic, of the potential productivity of plantations and forests therein, of timber supplies and of such other facts as he may consider necessary for the sound and balanced development of the forest and timber industry in the Republic.</block>

<p>This was a very sensible provision in the Act, and after just two years we have already obtained very important results. I want to express a word of thanks here to everyone who helped with these surveys. It is thanks to the help of the timber producers and all the other persons and bodies that have given their assistance that we already have results. A preliminary study based on the data we have obtained thus far indicates that in 1972 we shall already have a timber shortage of 1.3 million cubic metres. In the case of saw logs there will be a shortage of half a million cubic metres. We shall have a pulpwood shortage of 444,000 cubic metres. We shall have a mining timber shortage of 375,000 cubic metres and a 7,500 cubic metre shortage in respect of poles. It is only in the case of matchwood that we shall have a small surplus of 10,000 cubic metres. The total net timber shortage will therefore be 1.3 million cubic metres. If we convert this into cubic feet we see that in 1972 the shortage will be 46.7 million cubic feet.</p>

<p>My motion proposes that we take positive steps to make the country self-sufficient in this connection. Now we can rightfully ask ourselves whether it is in the country&#x2019;s interests that we should specifically be self-sufficient in this sphere, or whether we should not preferably import&#x003F; There are, for example, our agricultural products that certainly have first claim on our water and our land. These can also be exported, because they can earn us valuable foreign exchange. Then there are also our industries and our cities that must be provided with water. When we have put forward these points, I want to allege that forestry has a rightful claim to all the water and land that can be made available to it.</p>

<p>There are so many pieces of land in the Republic that can still usefully be planted. There are, for example, pieces of waste land on farmlands that is good for nothing else. I am thinking, for example, of the mountain catchment areas that are very frequently needed for water run-offs, but in other cases they can also be very usefully employed for forestry.</p>

<p>I realize that the State has an afforestation policy. But what I am advocating here today is that in the implementation of this policy we must now work out a general afforestation programme for the country as a whole and purposefully pursue it. It appears to me, for example, that when the State purchases land for forestry purposes, it chiefly purchases land that is offered in passing, and that there is not a purposeful plan in the purchase of such land. In addition the State also depends upon the private sector for the planting of trees.</p>

<p>I therefore want to propose for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s consideration that the afforestation policy should be more dynamic. At the commencement of such a dynamic afforestation policy there are quite a number of questions that must be answered. There is, for example, the question of where the trees ought to be planted&#x003F; Thus far this has been done in high rainfall areas. That is probably correct, because the trees grow better there. But I also want to say that we must give attention to the arid parts of the country. Why can only pepper trees and bluegum trees be planted along the streets of the towns in the Karoo and along our national roads&#x003F; Is there no room perhaps for our other very lovely trees&#x003F; I now want to appeal to public bodies, the municipalities and divisional councils to plant other trees as well. I believe that there are few places in our country where we cannot get other trees to grow with a little water, patience and effort. The scientists say that one will not easily change the climate of a country by planting trees. But I believe that one can make one&#x2019;s country much more attractive by planting trees. That is why we must encourage the planting of trees throughout the country wherever we can, and not only in the high rainfall areas. The next question we must ask ourselves is how rapidly the planting must take place and what the needs are&#x003F; Studies were carried out in this connection, <span class="col_1751-1752" refersTo="page_0889"/>and we are now getting results. I believe that in the future these figures will show us very nicely what we have to do. We shall not only have to make more surveys of the possibilities, but also of the consumption. More guidance must also be given to producers about what they must plant and where it must be planted. We shall perhaps need to have more technical officers in the Department of Forestry that can go round giving people advice.</p>

<p>Who must undertake this afforestation development&#x003F; I want to say that the State must continue with its policy. It must plant trees in every suitable spot. Last year the Mountain Catchment Areas Act was passed in this House. It is a very important Act that can provide where planting may take place and where it may not. I do not want to go into the provisions of that Act any further at this stage, but I believe that its implementation is also very important in this connection. The State must therefore continue with its afforestation programme. But what I specifically want to advocate here today is that the State should consider giving financial assistance to the private sector. Financial assistance should not only be given to big land owners, but also to the ordinary farmer. I think that we should encourage people to plant more trees.</p>

<p>Today I also want to appeal to the public bodies to continue with the planting of trees, even without State assistance. Here I am thinking, for example, of our municipalities that own large pieces of land where there are water catchment areas, or even commonage that is very suitable for the planting of trees. They must do it without the State&#x2019;s assistance. But when we come to private initiative I think it is necessary for the State to grant financial assistance. I think that if we continue with this policy we shall make our country a lovelier and pleasanter country for the succeeding generations.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to welcome this motion by the hon. member for Humansdorp. He is a person who has shown in the past his interest in the forest industry. It is a pleasure to be able to support this motion. It carried with it many implications which deal with the rightful use of land and water. I agree with the hon. member that forestry can rightfully demand land and water above the claims above the other sectors of our economy, above the claims of agriculture in certain areas and above the claims of municipalities in certain areas. I believe that this is something which is of the utmost importance to the future of South Africa.</p>

<p>I would be in a very difficult position if I did not support the hon. member&#x2019;s motion, because he would then be able to quote my own Hansard of last year during the Forestry debate. I want to touch on it, because one of the points which the hon. member mentions in his motion namely encouraging the private sector to undertake planting on a more extensive scale by the granting of financial assistance, was not really fully dealt with by the hon. member. I should like to stress the year during the Forestry debate when I raised the question of allowing the private farmer to maintain his position in the timber growing industry by means of loans which can be made to the farmer at a reasonable rate of interest. I said then and I say again now that I do not regard 7 per cent as a reasonable rate of interest. I think the hon. the Minister indicated at that time that that was also a thought in the back of his mind. It is certainly not a reasonable rate of interest taking into consideration the current cost of timber growing and in view of the very long-term crop which is planted. If the hon. the Minister will make loans available, we should discuss the question of whether this should be done through the co-operative movement which is more and more becoming the centralizing factor in the private industry or whether it should be done through the Department and how it could be carried out. I do not wish to traverse that ground again, because I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us something today of how far he has reached in his negotiations. Because, as the hon. the Minister himself pointed out last year, it was a question of negotiation with the Treasury and with other Government departments. He also pointed out that this could not be done throughout the entire country, but only in areas indicated for such purposes. Obviously, the Department of Forestry is going to have to play a determining role in where this type of afforestation can take place. The idea which was basic to our approach is that of the woodlot farmer, which is common in Europe. I mentioned last year, and I stress again today, that the private farmers&#x2019; only stake in the timber industry as it is today is farming on a very large scale. The growing of timber is today becoming a large <span class="col_1753-1754" refersTo="page_0890"/>scale industry. Certainly in my area in Natal, one finds that the small man is going out of timber growing. He has already gone out of wattle growing to a very very large extent and he is now going out of timber growing because of the economies of scale which the larger companies can practise and because of the increasing difficulty of sitting in to his labour requirements, the timber he grows on his farm. If the private, ordinary farmer&#x2014;I do not mean the farmer with 120,000, 50,000, or even 10,000 acres&#x2014;with a small stake in the timber industry, is to be maintained it has to be on the basis of what is called in Europe the woodlot. The woodlot in Europe is a central feature to the small farmer. These trees are tended with care, as if they were babies. They realize a tremendous amount of income. Each tree is virtually marketed individually. I do not suggest that we need to go quite as far as that in this country, because the varieties of timber we have do not have the same value. But where a man can plant, say 100 acres of trees, I believe the State must give him assistance for him to become interested and to retain his interest in the timber industry. To my mind, this is the kernel of the motion which the hon. member for Humansdorp has brought before the House today. The hon. member mentioned, in passing, the wattle industry. I was not quite sure whether he intended that the State should enter the wattle industry. In fact. I am quite certain this was not intended. I beg the hon. the Minister not to take that into consideration, because we have enough trouble in the wattle industry as it is. The point surely is that there are other hardwoods, and softwoods particularly, which are peculiarly suited to the purposes of the State.</p>

<p>The use of statistics, which the hon. member for Humansdorp mentioned, must begin to show the trend in the use and production of pulpwood in particular. I mention this, because it seems to me that the licencing of new plants for the processing of pulp and even for the production of paper, is something we must consider. We must consider this actively, became it can be a very important source of foreign exchange. I think we all know the position in the pulpwood industry at the moment. There is a large over-production which has, in fact, been the cause of some discontent, or perhaps disagreement between the Department, private industry and the industrial users. But if timber can be used to benefit the country by bringing in foreign exchange, then I think that active consideration should be given to the balancing up and encouragement of the planting of pulpwood with a view to one or more further pulp plants. I wish to say a bit more about that later on, because it will tie in with the attitude of the Department and the private grower in relation to price negotiations.</p>

<p>I believe the point has been reached where the export of timber is something which the hon. the Minister and his Department are going to have to consider, in that i believe the wattle industry has today signed a contract with Japan interests for the export of wattle chips at a price which will be twice the realization to the private grower of anything paid in this country. There is a significant amount of timber to be exported in terms of that agreement. This must have a profound effect on timber prices, especially wattle prices, because of the take-off of wattle which will not be available in this country. I believe that this again is something which the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department must look at. I know, of course, that they are concerned in the negotiations. This is a matter which nobody could undertake without the closest co-operation of the hon. the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>A question was raised by the hon. member concerning the afforestation of ground at present in the hands of the hon. the Minister and his department. It is odd that land was often in the past handed over to the Department of Forestry on a rather haphazard basis. The department were really the heirs of all the ground which no one else in the country wanted. Automatically it was given to the Department of Forestry who could administer it and look after it and so on. Land which is held on that basis, is often difficult to plant efficiently, because there are little bits and pieces scattered about the country which do not make for an efficient unit. It is my thought that the scattered areas which today lie in the hands of the Department of Forestry might be better developed by private interests, rather than the State itself, on whatever basis the hon. the Minister and his department may decide upon, whether on the agency basis, or by means of loans or subsidies as we have mentioned.</p>

<p>As suggested, it could be done on a lease basis. Certainly it should be on some basis, so that the private grower is given a chance, because I believe it is easier for a small grower to interest himself in such areas than for the department to have a host of small areas planted up here and there.</p>

<p>I think that the question of further planting is, of course, tied up absolutely and completely with the question of water supply. We are told that approximately 5 per cent of the total area of our country is really suitable for afforestation. These are obviously the areas which are the sources of our water. It is the old story. We know that there is a very very great difference of opinion between agricultural users of water and the forest industry, as I have already said. There was the case of the Eastern shores of St. Lucia, where ground was in the possession of the Department of Forestry. It was swampy land and it was planted up, which had the effect of drying up those areas. A report was drawn up for the Natal Parks Board by Ken Tinley which certainly indicated that there was an important source of fresh water flowing into Lake St. Lucia from the eastern shore areas which are being afforested by the Forestry Department. I am not a scientific person and do not intend passing judgment on that report. I mention St. Lucia as an indication of the sort of problem which we are going to have to face if we are now going to afforest virtually all the areas which are suitable for afforestation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has the most fortunate dual capacity of being both Minister of Water Affairs and of Forestry, and he might well find that he is biting his own tail, if I may put it that way. The interest of his one department will be in conflict with the other. At least it will be easier for him to sort it out than if two different people were involved. I think that this is an important factor in favour of the forest industry, because if there were a Minister of Water Affairs intent on water and a Minister of Forestry intent on Forestry, there would perhaps be a serious conflict. This hon. Minister has himself got both interests at heart. It comes down to the question of priorities&#x2014;whether the farmers or the department are entitled to use water which falls on their land to their best own advantage. I think we should accept that it is a reasonable proposition that any owner of ground, whether it be the department or a farmer, should be allowed to do that. The hon. the Minister himself has indicated his concern about this matter by the proclamation of certain areas as catchment control areas. I think that it is commonly agreed by all sides of this House that this sort of pattern will have to be extended, if the Minister and his department, as well as the private side of the industry, are going to extend their plantings. If loans are made available to us in order to encourage us to afforest further areas of the country, it is clearly incumbent on the Minister and his department to indicate which areas have to be protected from afforestation. I say, already we have these areas and it so happens that most of them are within my constituency. I think this ought to be the pattern for the future, a direction in which we shall have to move. A plan has to be drawn up. I do not know whether this is going to be one of the functions of the Water Research Commission we were talking about yesterday. In any event, a plan will have to be drawn up, a delimited area in which no afforestation can take place.</p>

<p>I should now like to come to a problem which the hon. member for Humansdorp left out of his motion while it could well have been added with a view to encouraging the private sector to afforest. It concerns the competition between the department and the private grower in the marketing of timber, particularly of pulp-wood. Last year in a debate the hon. the Minister told us that the department was producing only 19 per cent of the pulp-wood produced in South Africa. I think it is common cause that price negotiations between the private industry and the largest user of pulp-wood have virtually reached a deadlock. I am unaware of any agreement having been reached, an agreement which is mutually satisfying. I would have liked to see this motion embracing a request to the Minister to align his department with the private growing sector in any type of negotiation that takes place on prices with the industrial sector. Last year, when I also raised this same matter in a debate, the hon. member for Humansdorp agreed with me that it should be so. So, we have agreement on both sides that we ought to have a position which would guarantee the position of the private grower. If people are going to accept loans, albeit at a low rate of interest, they are committing not only themselves but also their sons and people who may come onto their farms <span class="col_1757-1758" refersTo="page_0892"/>after them to something which they believe would give them a profitable return. But now there is 19 per cent of the pulp-wood production which is not tied to their negotiations. This hangs, as it were, as a cloud over any price negotiations. The private sector is reaching a stage today where they have very accurate price costing. I have never been able to find out on what basis the department costs its production but obviously it has a system which it uses. But are these two bases the same&#x003F; Should the cost of the private sector not be accepted as the realistic cost of production of the sort of person who is being encouraged to afforest ground&#x003F; Is it not possible for the hon. the Minister to align his department with the private grower&#x003F; If there are to be realistic price negotiations &#x2014;of course, the Minister holds in his own hands the ultimate say about what the price is to be&#x2014;if the private grower is to be strong enough to negotiate with what is a mighty concern, a tremendously powerful concern, a concern which holds the industrial side of the timber industry in its hands, then we shall have to guarantee the position of the private grower. It is very important indeed that a private grower should realize that if he is to commit himself to loans, which have to be repaid at any rate, he is undertaking a future commitment. And who knows what the price structure will be like when timber going through a 20/30 year cycle is marketed&#x003F; May I just mention that the interest rate of a quarter per cent is to me a very attractive rate of interest, something we all should like to see in our country! At any rate, as I say, the private grower is undertaking a commitment and consequently he has to have the assurance that there will be the closest possible co-operation and alignment between the department and him. The 19 per cent pulp-wood being produced by the department is not an insignificant figure: on the contrary it is a considerable slice of the production. So. I put this forward for the earnest attention of the hon. the Minister in so far as private interests in timber are concerned.</p>

<p>There is one other question. Do the statistics which have so far come into his department give us any idea of the land available to his department and privately for afforestation&#x003F; Do they give any indication of the potential production of timber in South Africa&#x003F; How far are we able to meet what our anticipated demand is likely to be&#x003F; I think I am fairly safe in saying that we cannot be fully self-supporting in this respect except for certain lines. There are lines where it might be necessary to canalize production. For instance, when giving a loan to a producer it will be for the production of a certain line of timber. This ought to be done in order to satisfy either that line which is in biggest demand or a line which it is expensive to import from overseas. How is the department seeing the future&#x003F; When the Minister makes available these loans will he use that as a tool to canalize the development of the timber industry in the direction he wishes it to go&#x003F;</p>

<p>In so far as further afforestation by the State is concerned, the position is that the State is already a tremendously powerful producer. I think this is something where the private industry should be encouraged. I think the Minister himself is interested in maintaining the role of the private grower. If he was not, then obviously he wouldn&#x2019;t come here and make loans available. I welcome this. The private timber grower is not only a timber grower but also a farmer. It is merely another string to the bow of people who are farmers, certainly throughout the higher rainfall areas. The number of farmers who are merely timber growers is very small. Usually they produce all types of product, including timber. By making it possible for a man to plant perhaps 100 or 200 acres on rocky or out-of-the-way ground, ground not easily accessible for his general farming practice, the hon. Minister would be guaranteeing the survival of the White farmer on an economic basis. In the circumstances I welcome his intention as he announced it in the debate last year, the intention to make loans available and I hope today he will be able to give us some further details and an indication how far he has got with the negotiations that have been taking place.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. P. C. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had just begun my speech when the adjournment occurred. I just wanted to record my satisfaction at the fact that the State, as far as the motion before the House is concerned, realized the desirability of linking up the Department of Forestry and Water Affairs. The past year was Water <span class="col_1759-1760" refersTo="page_0893"/>Year, and the attention of all the people in the entire Republic was focused on the importance of water and water conservation, and it found its mark. I think it would perhaps not be unfitting to think in similar terms of forestry, perhaps on a slightly smaller scale. Not much is said about forestry, and there is no day-long quibbling about it. And yet it is very important, not only as a money earner, but also as a means for allowing so many farmers to subsist in those parts where forestry is in fact carried out. For that reason I should like to associate myself with the motion. I should also like to congratulate the member who moved the motion, the hon. member for Humansdorp, most heartily on the way in which he did so. In the course of my speech I shall also refer here and there to certain statements made by the hon. member for Mooi River. It is actually interesting to see that he does not differ from us on the question of forestry, and that we, as foresters and farmers, and on behalf of the people we represent, are probably unanimous in feeling that it is a very important matter, and will be a very important matter in the future.</p>

<p>The motion before the House is very clearly divided into two parts. The first part deals with self-sufficiency through State afforestation. I do not want to elaborate much on that, except to say that in the past State afforestation was regarded by the private sector as a rival, and that at one time in the past, for example. State afforestation and the Department of Forestry acted independently in respect of wage increases, and made things very uncomfortable for our farmers. Pursuant to the motion I want to say at this stage, however that the position has changed completely and that we are satisfied that the State is now giving the farmers the closest co-operation. In that respect we want to congratulate the Department and the hon. the Minister on the fact that they now have a greater appreciation of the importance of the individual farmer as against that of the Department.</p>

<p>The second part of the motion deals with the question of financial assistance to the private sector. I think it would be fitting if we put it to the hon. the Minister that there are certain reasons for the fact that we have fallen behind, as the member who moved this motion stated put it to this hon. House, at such a rate that we shall have a tremendous backlog by the year 2,000 as far as supplying ourselves is concerned, and that we shall then to a greater extent be committed to importing our timber and timber needs from abroad. But it is also interesting, and one would like to have it recorded, that we have delved into the reasons why we have fallen behind. The member who moved the motion said that there is a limited portion of our country where we can plant forest. In fact, the committee of inquiry that went into the matter also said that the area where we can apply afforestation is reasonably limited. But there are additional factors.</p>

<p>The private sector, as we all know, and the farmers also know, are themselves divided into two groups. The first group consists of big producers with large capital, who are also the processors of the timber products that are delivered. In those cases we have had a great deal of difficulty in the past; it caused great concern. It led to the legislation that was submitted in 1968, and to the grading of timber. However, this did not entirely solve our problem. The backlog will in reality become greater as our timber requirements in the Republic increase, for the simple reason that the individual farmer cannot manage afforestation in competition with these large undertakings that recently even capitalized or liquidated other interests. In this way the large firms obtain the capital for purchasing even larger tracts of land in order to eventually make themselves self-sufficient in terms of the factories in which they have their interests.</p>

<p>We are falling behind because the individual forester, the ordinary small farmer or the farmer who perhaps goes in for large-scale mixed farming and is only a small forester, but nevertheless has quite a bit of space in which he cannot undertake agricultural activities on an economic basis, cannot produce economically. We consequently find that there are large areas where afforestation can take place, but where it is not done because there are certain problems in respect of marketing, for example. We also find that the small farmer, and when I speak of the small farmer I mean the small farmer as the second leg of the private sector, is left to his own devices. Today we find that even though the small farmer produces, and even if he has the material available, he can hardly get rid of it at economic prices because he cannot tender competitively with the present-day bodies applying <span class="col_1761-1762" refersTo="page_0894"/>for contracts in which those small foresters or small farmers cannot share&#x2014; these include mining undertakings as well as semi-Government and Government undertakings such as the Electricity Supply Commission. They cannot tender competitively on a basis on which everyone can get a large enough share in the market, and then they are actually committed to becoming sub-contractors of those large companies.</p>

<p>I want to mention an example. The example I want to use is that of an undertaking such as the Electricity Supply Commission that makes use of 30, 35, 40 and 45 foot poles drawn from the forestry industry. They take no notice of a man with 10,000 trees, or 30, 40 or perhaps 150 acres of trees on his farm when they need almost half a million poles. They take no notice of his tender; it is too insignificant for consideration. When their products are marketable these small entrepreneurs are committed to selling them to the large entrepreneurs who can supply 70 per cent of the tender and then rely on the fact that further timber can be purchased.</p>

<p>The result is that the small producer has become afraid of doing any further planting, and consequently we are getting into ever greater difficulties. We are lagging further behind in the provision of the necessary timber supplies. It is therefore necessary for this motion to be before the House today. We trust that the hon. the Minister welcomes such a motion in the House. We must realize once and for all that the small sector of the rural population, the farming community, must not be committed to remaining a mere adjunct to the larger companies who are well endowed with capital, and that consequently sufficient State assistance should be given to the small man. They must be given the assurance that if they produce they will be able to get rid of their products.</p>

<p>In the case of the example I mentioned, we find that the Escom organization pays respectively R5.47. R7.52 and R9.89 per pole for the 30. 35 and 40 foot poles with respectively four to five, five to six and six to seven inch tops. The 35 foot poles with four and five inch, six and seven inch and seven and eight inch tops are purchased by tender for R6.48, R15.53, R11.27 and R18.39 per pole respectively. These poles have a very large market&#x2014;on the other hand there are, of course, the mines &#x2014;and offer a very good illustration of what the farmer is actually faced with. Those poles can be creosoted at an average estimate cost of about R1 per pole. To the amount I mentioned R1 per pole is then added. The balance is then profit made by the big forester on the contracts he entered into with the Government or the semi-Government organization.</p>

<p>But the irony of the situation is that the contractor does not have a sufficient supply of those same lengths of poles in stock, or in his plantation, and must purchase them. The offer he then makes to the producer is about R1 per pole. To tell the truth, it is less than R1. The contractor therefore pays R1 for the pole, and to that is added his transport costs and the costs of having the pole treated with creosote. The balance is then profit. As a result he can comply in full with his tender, in fact at the expense of the small farmer who consequently does not have a rightful share in the market that is available for that specific kind of timber. This is not only the case in this particular field. The same applies to the pulp manufacture. The pulp wood that is used at present is soft timber. Consequently the farmers do not plant that timber on a small scale. They cannot plant it on a small scale, because they do not have a rightful share in the market.</p>

<p>For that reason certain of these large factories that manufacture pulp on a contract basis in the Bantu areas on behalf of the Department of Bantu Administration have concluded large contracts for the planting of the relevant timber. Now the small farmer fears that when these plantations come into full production they will land up in the same boat and eventually simply have to accept an arbitrary price for their timber. These plantations will come into production shortly, because they were chiefly planted after 1948. Consequently these farmers are no longer interested in planting such trees, and attention is now chiefly being given to production. Farmers are now establishing plantations in the parts where use cannot normally be made of ordinary agricultural machinery for the growing of various kinds of foodstuffs. They simply plough up the grass, and on that fallow land they then plant forests, and their production costs are therefore low. If a farmer plants enough he can make ends meet because he can lay claim to a share with these large companies.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that forestry is being handicapped by such practices. <span class="col_1763-1764" refersTo="page_0895"/>The benefits these practices have for our timber industry are questionable. The small forester does not have the necessary capital at his disposal. The problem of providing this small forester with capital was clearly stated in the motion of the hon. member for Humansdorp. The hon. member for Mooi River agreed with him in that connection. He referred to the fact that last year the hon. the Minister held out the prospect that in the course of time such loans would in fact be made available.</p>

<p>In the past month I read a report somewhere to the effect that the Department of Agricultural Credit would be prepared to make loans available at a subsidized interest rate of 5 per cent for the purpose of forestry. What the ordinary forester needs is not that his industry should be linked up with another department, but that he should be able to seek his welfare and protection with the Department of Forestry. He wants to feel if he has furnished his product, be it small or large, that he will have the necessary protection and that he will have a rightful share in the available market <i>pro rata</i> the quantity of trees he has planted. In reality the wattle bark industry has collapsed, because only one-sixth of the mature trees can be marketed today at&#x2014;this I do concede&#x2014;a relative high price. There must be about 200 acres of these trees for a basic quota of say 70 tons.</p>

<p>When this is calculated on a 12-year cycle, one finds that the land yield on that basis is only about R10 per year per acre. It is so very little that one can virtually do better with a crop failure on a cash crop basis than with afforestation, particularly with respect to wattle bark. The market is so sensitive that during the 1965 to 1968 period people withdrew themselves from the wattle bark industry. As a result of the problems that developed in the marketing of bark about 97,538 acres were withdrawn from the industry. As we all know there was also an investigation in this connection, and an Act was placed on the Statute Book. Provision was, however, only made for the bark and not for the timber of those wattle bark trees. It is with pleasure that I can mention that during the past year or so a station and three co-operative undertakings were established that handle the timber that constitutes the waste product of the wattle bark industry. The timber furnished by this industry is about three times as much as the bark. This wood can serve a useful purpose.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River said that we should not consider the timber from these trees as part of a plantation. I have already mentioned that there is now a good market for the sale of wattle bark tree splinters to Japan at very profitable prices. However, things are not yet in order in the wattle bark industry, and I do not want to go into the reasons for that at this stage. We shall probably get an opportunity to do so at a later stage. These facts, however, are contributing to the decline of this industry.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that the timber producer pays a tremendous amount for the transportation of his product. For its weight, this timber is a relatively cheap product to transport. With the recent oppressive drought it was found, however, that the transportation of livestock and fodder to the drought-stricken areas enjoyed precedence. I do not want to complain about that, because I think it should be done again if it is necessary. However, the fact remains that at the time there were many trees that had already been chopped down and were ready for the market. Those trees are marketed with a certain moisture content. As a result of the fact that this product could not be transported immediately, because it does not decay very easily, some of those farmers suffered a loss of up to 70 per cent on the weight of their product in other words the farmer lost this percentage on his total crop. Because something like this could happen again it is absolutely necessary for the State to intervene in granting assistance.</p>

<p>It is not only a problem of rail transportation, it is also one of labour and education. We know that with the approval of the Treasury a small amount is made available in the Revenue Account for timber research. With a view to the future, and with a view to the education of the farmer&#x2014;which is not inadequate at present, but which could be undertaken on a much larger scale&#x2014;we should like to see a greater amount voted. We notice that in the Estimates for the year 1970-&#x2019;71 only R16,690,000 was voted for the entire forestry industry. Sir, an amount larger than R16,690,000 is surely necessary for an industry that saves the State about R30 million per year in foreign exchange. In respect of that amount we therefore want to ask that thought be given in the future to <span class="col_1765-1766" refersTo="page_0896"/>making provision for the farmer so that the loans mentioned by the member who moved the motion can become a reality.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River made an allegation here that I cannot let pass, i.e. that the Natal Parks Boards had conducted a survey and found that the water in the lakes decreased as a result of afforestation. I just want to say that I cannot altogether accept this as an authentic conclusion based on a very scientific investigation, because the Department of Forestry, which now has the Department of Water Affairs as its sister organization, will surely not devour its sister organization&#x2019;s food so that it will starve. This survey was done during a period of serious drought, and that is why I believe that that water was not sucked up by the trees, but by the aeration of the soil it had to penetrate in order to reach those lakes. I want to suggest that before one makes such a statement and blames the Department one should first delve into the matter scientifically. As far as I know pine trees are planted in that area, and we know that the pine tree uses very little water. The great consumers of water are the bluegum trees or the saligna species. We also know that there are only certain areas in which they can be planted, and we know that with the co-operation of Water Affairs the planting of those trees next to streams, were these streams would be drained as a result of the greater water consumption of that specific forestry product, would not be allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude by promising my wholehearted support to this motion, and I want to express the hope that with the competent staff that he has, the Minister will take up the cudgels for us and ensure that, in the first place, we encourage the small foresters by investigating the marketing channels, for example, and by eliminating the doubts that exist for the general producer and the farmer. Whether a Government department is involved or not. I nevertheless think it is still necessary for a comprehensive investigation to be undertaken specifically in relation to the question of marketing, not as a part of a larger whole, but separately. Therefore, Sir, it is a great honour for me to second this motion formally.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN ECK</person>:</from>

<p>The Secretary for Forestry, Mr. H. L. Malherbe, said in his report for 1968-&#x2019;69&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the past 65 years great strides have been made by the Republic of South Africa in establishing sufficient plantations to meet our country&#x2019;s requirements of soft wood structural timber. Our plantations are now meeting this need almost fully.</block>

<p>This is an outstanding achievement, Sir, and I want to congratulate the Department of Forestry and all timber producers on that achievement. In the presidential address to the South African Institute of Forestry in May, 1970, Mr. D. P. Ackerman pointed out that 20 years ago South Africa used 80 million cubic feet of home-produced timber as compared with 285 million cubic feet in 1969, excluding firewood. This represents a growth rate of 6 per cent a year, which is about three times as high as the population increase over the same period. If the annual growth of 6 per cent is projected until the end of the century it would mean a consumption of 1,500 million cubic feet a year, a taxing production figure for South Africa with its limited forestry potential. According to the annual reports of anticipated consumption and requirements of timber sawmills, pulp and paper manufacturers, plywood factories, the mining industry and other important consumers, our demand is increasing by more than the 6 per cent which is used in this projection. The anticipated increase in the consumption of timber will be 8 per cent per year over the next three years and after that even more. This is a tremendous challenge to the timber producers of South Africa to keep up with the country&#x2019;s timber requirements. Wood has become one of the characteristic world-wide raw materials of civilization. It produces food for man and beast. It has already become the second most important source of textile fibres. Wood clothes a large section of the population with artificial fibres, such as rayon. As a building material it provides a variety of products, such as plywood and plates, plastics and resins which can satisfy countless engineering requirements. Wood provides the tables on which we eat, the chairs on which we sit, the beds on which we sleep and even the coffins in which we are buried. There is a large shortage of wood for furniture in South Africa. We cannot meet a third of our requirements, in spite of the fact that we possess a large variety of indigenous precious woods like white alder, yellowwood, wild olive wood, tamboti, assegaai wood and stinkwood, to mention <span class="col_1767-1768" refersTo="page_0897"/>just a few of our varieties of wood. The prices continue rising and the good, dark, hard, mature wood is virtually unobtainable. Some articles of furniture made of stinkwood have more than doubled in price over the past three years at the furniture manufacturers of George and Knysna, in spite of the fact that they are made of the soft, white, young wood which is not of the best. Fortunately, foreign varieties which do well here, have filled this gap to a certain extent, in that they grow faster, and they also help to satisfy the requirements as the result of the fact that they germinate by themselves in our indigenous forests. In this respect I am thinking especially of blackwood, from Australia, <i>Acacia melanoxylon,</i> which germinates and develops in the natural forests among our indigenous trees. I should like to see us propagating and planting our indigenous precious-wood trees far more actively by means of seeds and cuttings, especially where they occurred previously and have now been destroyed, and also to replace trees which have been chopped down for furniture timber. I realize it is a long-term investment, but we must put back what we have exploited. We owe it to posterity. The problem is, however, that we do not quite know how to propagate our indigenous trees effectively. We do not know whether it is best to propagate them by means of seed, cuttings or young plants. I know germination tests are being done on stinkwood seeds at the University of Stellenbosch. These were only started very recently, but are being carried out on a large scale, also at the experimental nursery at Saasveld. What is required, Sir, is that we carry out research, planning and the application of the necessary programme based on that, far more actively and positively. I realize that a large shortage of staff and workers is having a very restrictive effect on that programme. Everywhere in the 1968-&#x2019;69 report of the Department of Forestry one reads of staff shortages. It is pointed out that the fixed establishment has shown an annual decrease since 1965. In 1968-&#x2019;69 78 posts were abolished. It is stated that although there is a great need for professional officers, posts in the professional division are created only as staff becomes available. In other words, almost no expansion can take place. In that year the Department was in the fortunate position that 12 posts could be created in that division. This is quite inadequate for the tremendous expansion which lies ahead and the challenge which we will have to face. In my opinion, more use should be made of non-White and Bantu labour in the Department of Forestry, for example as operators and tractor drivers, especially in these extensive areas. In the interests of the country, I hope the Department of Forestry will be able to solve these problems. I therefore find it a pleasure to support this motion.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I want to join in expressing appreciation towards the hon. member who introduced this motion for the valuable contribution he and other speakers made in connection with a very important facet which I, and I take it all of us, consider it to be a very important facet of our agricultural industry. It is indeed refreshing to find that we have been able to discuss in such a particularly good-natured way, a component part of agriculture, a component part which is of great importance, a facet of this nature in the field of agriculture, a field with so many bottlenecks and problems and with which we have been so closely concerned during the past few years. I am grateful that this is so, because this aspect of agriculture one indeed finds inspiring, it is one of the noble aspects of agriculture and it is a very important component part of agriculture. For the past five years the growth rate in respect of forestry has remained constant at 6 per cent. This indicates that we are dealing with an industry, the growth rate of which is higher today than our national growth rate. The expected growth rate in respect of timber as such for the future is expected to be 4.5 per cent and 7 per cent in respect of paper wood or pulp. This still gives an average growth rate of 5.75 per cent. Furthermore, if one considers the fact that the total yield of the industry amounts to the round sum of R340 million, and that an additional amount of R30 million is earned from the export of timber and by-products, it becomes clear why it is such an important part of our agricultural industry. But this is not only important because of its monetary yield. It is very important for us in South Africa because of our own requirements which exist at present and which are gradually increasing and as they will be at the turn of the century.</p>

<p>Sir, when you look at the map of South Africa&#x2014;and I have here a map of South Africa on which those parts suitable for forestry are indicated&#x2014;you will see a <span class="col_1769-1770" refersTo="page_0898"/>number of black spots on this map indicating which parts of the country are suitable for forestry only. And if I show you this map, Sir, you will see that it is not the Bantu homelands which are shown here, but those parts which can be used only for afforestation. The position is that only a very small part of our country, and that includes an area such as Swaziland, approximately .83 per cent of the surface area of South Africa is suitable for afforestation purposes. Let us consider the position as it exists at present. At the end of the year 1969 we had a total area of approximately 2.5 million acres under afforestation, approximately 1.3 million of which consisted of conifers and approximately 1.2 million of other kinds of trees. When comparing this with the fact that approximately 126,000 acres have been under afforestation since the year 1960, it is clear that the area under afforestation remained virtually constant during these years and that hardly any appreciable expansion has taken place during this period. Bearing in mind, also, that our local consumption of timber in the year 2000, at the turn of this century, is expected to amount to approximately 1,000 million cubic feet, which we shall be able to derive from the yield of 4.6 million acres under afforestation, while we only have a surface area of 2.5 million acres under afforestation at present, this is proof that we are heading for an enormous shortage of timber in this country at the turn of the century. In addition, when analysing the existing afforestation, there is this additional fact that we are not going to have a constant supply because there is a discrepancy in these afforestations. They will only be available after a certain number of years and the fact of the matter is that we are not going to have a progressive supply in this connection. In order to be able to cope with this situation, it is obvious that we will have to plant more trees in this country during the next 15 years. If we want to cope with this situation we will have to plant at least 670,000 acres of conifers and 700,000 acres of other kinds of trees in future. We have already fallen behind with this programme to the extent where we have a backlog of 500,000 conifers and 240,000 other trees. Sir, this position can continue until 1980, but after that the position will definitely become chronic. Considering the additional fact that trees will probably have to be cut prematurely, owing to this shortage and expected shortage, it is evident that we will have to do something to cope with the situation. Afforestation will have to be expedited to the extent where we are self-sufficient. To do this, the State will have to act in co-ordination with the private sector. Available land will also have to be acquired for this purpose. It is interesting to note that the afforestation carried out by the State at this stage represents approximately 31 per cent of the total afforestation, while the private sector is responsible for approximately 69 per cent of the afforestation. As previous speakers said, the State and the private sector now have an opportunity, in the interests of this industry and in the interests of our country, to conclude a partnership which can be of great benefit to all of us. Each of these partners will be able to make a great contribution.</p>

<p>It is true that it will not be easy to establish something of this nature. It is also a fact that we are going to experience some bottlenecks in this regard in future, bottlenecks we will have to overcome. The first aspect is something which has already been dealt with in detail, that is the stabilization of the price level, so that when the producer, who is expected to produce on a long-term basis, fells and supplies his product at the end of a period, he will receive a price which is profitable for him. It should be borne in mind that, in order to be able to do this, that price will have to be determined in advance because we expect these producers to tackle a project now in respect of which they will only be able to reap the benefits after a period of 15 to 25 years has elapsed. This is a life-task for the producer. It is this price which is going to determine whether that life-task of the producer is going to be a total failure or not. He must be able to regard the project as an investment, in respect of which he will be able to make a profit at the end of that period. For that reason all these are aspects which will have to be borne in mind.</p>

<p>There is also, for example, the increase in the value of land over such a period of 10, 20 or 25 years, something which will also have to be borne in mind. This is a capital appreciation which will have to be taken into account, because the producer must know to what extent it will be profitable for him to utilize land for this purpose now, in the year 1971. We must remember that the value of land the market price of which is, for example, R60 or R100 per morgen at the present time, will, under normal instances, cost three times <span class="col_1771-1772" refersTo="page_0899"/>as much in 20 years&#x2019; time. These are factors which a producer or an entrepreneur entering this industry should bear in mind, and in respect of which some assurance should be given him even at this stage. This assurance must be given not so much in the case of the large entrepreneur, but particularly in the case of the smaller man who has to decide now to whether he wants to stake everything he has on this particular undertaking. One has to bear in mind the question of interest rates. One also has to bear in mind the cost increase which may arise at one stage or other.</p>

<p>For that reason it is essential that there should be constant and systematic contact between the Government, which is also active in this sphere, and the producer. This is essential so that it can be determined in a scientific way what the position is and what the position will be after this period has elapsed. It is a fact that there has recently been a sudden and sharp increase in the price of pulp wood, and I think that the farmer and the producer welcomed this. However, this is already a danger sign, which means that there is a shortage even in this field, particularly because pulp is actually a secondary product. In fact, this also creates a discrepancy, as matters stand at present, between the market prices of the pulp wood and the pulp as it stands and that of other kinds of wood. In fact, the position has degenerated, if one may use that term, to such an extent that the market price of the pulp and of the pulp wood is higher than the accepted price for good quality timber. This creates a discrepancy. For that reason I want to associate myself with the ideas expressed on the fixing and the stabilization of prices and the prevention of opportunistic tendencies. It is essential that the Department consult with the private sector even at this early stage. I agree with the hon. member for Mooi River that it is a sensible idea to consult the private sector because they have also been actively engaged in the industry on a large scale over a period of many years. I also agree that they know what the real position is in this regard.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the major bottleneck is the shortage of available land for this purpose. To my mind this should be attributed to the excessive demand for agricultural land, seen against the background of the drought-afflicted areas of the country. As a result of this, it is only a natural phenomenon that there should be an influx to these areas for agricultural purposes, these areas which have such a great potential for afforestation. This is the reason for the large-scale buying up of land by people who want to use this land for agricultural purposes, for grazing and so forth. This land, is therefore, almost automatically withdrawn from forestry and future afforestation. For that reason I also want to support the idea that, in view of this, certain parts of this land should be made available for afforestation purposes by means of departmental action. Our position is being prejudiced even now. I am thinking particularly of the fact mentioned by the hon. member for Vryheid, which is that there is virtually no market for wattle bark. Where approximately 900,000 acres were available for this purpose previously, approximately only 400,000 acres are available today. Actually, this is not really 400,000 acres, because in my experience when the producer applies for his annual quota, the area he replants is actually less than what he claims to have replanted&#x2014;I would not say he is making a misrepresentation&#x2014;bearing in mind the fact that quotas are reduced. At present it amounts to only 64 per cent of the basic quota. In the present season the quota has once again been reduced by 14 per cent. This the producer does in an attempt to retain a consistent quota. I think this is a position we should bear in mind.</p>

<p>In the short time I still have at my disposal, I want to say that we will have to devise ways and means of remedying this position. I want to suggest what has already been proposed, and that is that we should make liberal use of available State-owned land for this purpose. I am aware of the fact that there is still land available in the Eastern Transvaal and other parts of the country. I want to advance a plea that we should incorporate into the ordinary agricultural industry, the areas in the Eastern Transvaal in particular and possibly those in the Natal which are suitable for this type of industry, and where 38 per cent of afforestation takes place. In this connection I should like to point out to the hon. the Minister that large consortiums of companies have already purchased enormous stretches of land in these regions, particularly for this purpose. They are undertaking afforestation there. This will not detract from the production of timber, but this is taking the position completely out of the hands of the small producer. If this situation should continue, the <span class="col_1773-1774" refersTo="page_0900"/>entire industry is going to fall into the hands of the large companies at the expense of the small grower, who will have to forgo all advantages in this connection. A rather disturbing factor, particularly in this regard, is the fact that an enormous amount of capital is being spent by overseas companies and that the industry is being taken from us in this way.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to make a suggestion. When assistance is being rendered, it may be considered whether this should not be rendered on the same basis on which some of these companies render this assistance, and that is that a producer is subsidized or assisted to some extent, and that he is paid on a gradual basis over a period as his trees develop. In other words, he is paid on an instalment basis. The system operates in such a way that it becomes progressively more as his trees develop. He then receives the total amount over a period of time. In the meantime he is being profitably compensated.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we are discussing a matter which is near to the heart of every nature-lover. Now, we are in the fortunate position that we have a Minister&#x2014;I am not saying this without any cause, nor is it my intention to give him an uncalled-for pat on the back&#x2014;who possesses the qualities which can make him a good Minister of Forestry, i.e. those of being attuned to and living with nature, like a person wandering about in a plantation. What is more pleasant than that cool breeze that caresses one&#x2019;s cheeks in a plantation&#x003F; It can be likened to the caressing effect on the Gulf Stream which, coming from the Atlantic Ocean, washes up against the European shores. Take away the Gulf Stream, and Europe will rigidify into a desert of ice. The same applies to the cool breeze in a plantation. I know of no moment when, wandering about in a plantation with that cool breeze wafting against one&#x2019;s face, one is not inspired with a new lust for life. But that is not all. When one wanders about in a plantation and sees the sign and symbol of growth, that sight must have a beneficial effect on one&#x2019;s mind. It is symbolic of growth. The lifeless plant that cannot talk or reason, is an example to mankind. It grows. These towering trees, each of which is rivalling the others in thrusting up its top so as to catch the rays of the sun, are an incentive to every fallible human being to rise higher and higher, to grow, to reach the top, to practise excelsior in the true sense of the word.</p>

<p>This is not only a symbol of growth, but inherently it also contains one of the components of growth, i.e. competition. Nowhere do I find a finer example of the spirit of good competition on a sound basis than I do whenever I wander about in a plantation and see how those trees compete against one another in order to tower over the others. All of them compete to reach the light above. And when one has wandered about in such a plantation, felt the cool breeze wafting against one&#x2019;s cheeks, accepted the symbolism of growth and seen the value of competition, one says, &#x201C;Here something is growing out of the earth which is an asset to our country&#x201D;. Without words, without fuss, without self-glorification the tree grows as an asset to our country. There is not only money in trees; there is no product and no commodity in the world which is as much of a cultural product as timber is. People hunt after it. The older it gets, the higher the prices they pay for it. It is the true antique. No cultural product manufactured on earth is as precious and desirable as a product manufactured out of wood. It grows out of our earth without words. Silently an asset is growing.</p>

<p>It grows not only as a cultural asset, but also as an economic asset. Just cast an eye over this House in which we are sitting. I have very often asked myself this question: What could have made this House more attractive and dignified than in fact these wooden panels&#x003F; Nothing on earth. One could get the shiniest stainless steel on earth, one could get the purest gold to replace the wood. Gold only sparkles when it lies there in solitude and in its exclusiveness, like that mace. But mount this chamber with gold, and gold will lose its value. There is only one thing, i.e. wood which grows out of the earth, which gives us this everlasting value when we look at it. And every day it becomes more attractive. Visit a beautiful building, visit a State building, visit a private residence, and the wood used in those buildings, wood which has grown out of the earth, without words, without human hands helping it to grow, holds an eternal value and an eternal message for us. I want to congratulate the proposer of this motion on having proposed this motion by means of which he touched upon one of the products which grows out of our earth and which can be <span class="col_1775-1776" refersTo="page_0901"/>of the greatest value to us as civilized people and to our descendants.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to deal with what holds good in practice today. This is not the fault of the hon. the Minister, nor is it the fault of the U.P.; it is our people who are to blame. It is the fault of the generations of the past who did not have any appreciation for what was deserving of appreciation and granted us by the Creator. We merely regarded all of it as being secondary. Over the years the Department of Forestry has merely been regarded as a kind of appendix. Now that we see our natural forests being laid waste by the roads, the cities, the towns and the tractors, we are beginning to realize what is happening and to develop a sense of values. When, a short while ago, a farmer in the Northern Cape destroyed 3,000 morgen of natural forest so as to make room for maize, where maize should never have been planted, we saw before our own eyes an act of destruction committed by man. What was the result&#x003F; A sand desert was created there. Apart from the cultural value of afforestation and the development of our forestry industry, this industry can also be a source of great economic value to us. Where are our bottlenecks on this level of the economic value of our forestry industry&#x003F; I want to repeat that this is not the fault of the hon. the Minister, but that of previous generations. We did not pay enough attention to this matter. I want to pay the hon. the Minister the compliment that he appreciates the value of our forestry. The proposer of this motion also means it well. I want to deal with these bottlenecks that are to be found on the economic level, and I am going to do so in three parts.</p>

<p>In the first place, I think that we can pay attention to the production of timber. I am thinking of natural and planted forests. The major reason for there being so much neglect and frustration amongst farmers in regard to the planting of trees, is that production is being approached wrongly. People are using millions of gallons of water every year for watering trees which have no economic value. I am thinking, for instance, of a few peach trees, a little apple tree, a pomegranate tree, a cypress tree, a pepper tree or a bluegum tree. In this way millions of gallons of water are going to waste because of the cultivation of uneconomic kinds of trees in South Africa. I am speaking the truth now. As far as the production of timber is concerned, we must necessarily make a re-assessment on that level. In the second place, I think that we should make a re-assessment of the production areas. Now, the technicians and scientists are telling us that we are to determine our production areas according to the rainfall. With all due respect for science, I want to say that there is something else beyond the boundaries of science, i.e. what is possible through practical experience and actual practice. I want to say today that we can, with honest intentions, make a sound re-assessment of areas where we can plant more trees and forests which can be of economic value to South Africa. I honestly think that we need a re-assessment as regards the marketing of our timber. Mr. Speaker, I have here 49 letters written to a small-scale timber producer, 49 letters in which he was asked to quote prices for timber which he produces and markets. He told me that he had sent his price list to each of these 49 people who had applied, and that he had not received any reaction. He subsequently inquired into the matter in order to find out whether his prices were too high or whether his quality was unsatisfactory. It took him months to complete his inquiry, and he found out that the large moneyed enterprises&#x2014;which these people, as one can appreciate, also asked for prices&#x2014;completely under-quoted him at prices at which they must have made a loss, merely to oust him from the market. Sir, our marketing system is the greatest handicap to the small-scale producer or the individual producer who wants to concentrate on the part-time planting of forests or kinds of trees for economic purposes. The marketing system causes frustration. I want to appeal to the Minister today that serious attention be given to this marketing problem. I believe&#x2014;and here I differ with my hon. colleagues&#x2014;that it will not be necessary to help individual producers financially if each of them obtains a rightful share in the marketing system in South Africa. We have a shortage of timber; there is a major demand for poles and there is a major demand for furniture timber, etc., of which we have a shortage. But the small-scale producer who is already in production, does not have a rightful share, on the grounds of a legion of factors, in the marketing potential in South Africa, and because he does not have that, the prospective producer does not have the courage to enter into the field of timber production. There is a general marketing frustration. Sir, I know the hon. the Minister <span class="col_1777-1778" refersTo="page_0902"/>means it well; I know that we have a good Minister. I want to ask him kindly to eliminate these bottlenecks, for by doing that other channels will be opened up, initiative will be initiated, and every forester in South Africa, no matter how small he may be, will be placed in a position to bargain with the major moneyed forces.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it seems to me, with reference to this debate up to now, that this year we are going to have a very interesting discussion on the Forestry Vote. In their arguments and representations the hon. members who took part in this debate, concentrated on the important point which is at issue in this motion, i.e. that positive steps should be considered to make the country as self-sufficient as possible as far as its timber requirements are concerned by undertaking State afforestation on a more extensive scale, and that the private sector should be granted financial assistance in this regard. I am grateful that the hon. member for Humansdorp came forward with this motion, because I believe that it is essential for us to face the timber situation of South Africa at some time or other. Hon. members who took part in this debate today, mentioned quite a number of related problems. In the time at my disposal it will unfortunately be impossible for me to touch upon all of these problems. But I believe that we should be afforded an opportunity for considering those problems with which we cannot deal today. Before we come to the Forestry Vote I want to say that, even if hon. members who touched upon certain matters here today were not to raise them again on that occasion. I shall make a point of reading their speeches and replying on that occasion to the points which were mentioned here and which, to my mind, are of great importance. The hon. member who introduced this motion, tried to give an indication of the problem as it developed, and he also quoted figures. The hon. member for Mooi River added a different angle, and I know he also spoke about it previously, i.e. the contribution which the small forester can make in the provision of timber in South Africa. In a moment I shall come back to this and say something about it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ermelo made a very valuable contribution. He gave a survey of the situation, expressed in figures, and he also sounded a warning about an equally important matter, which we have also discussed in this House, i.e. the situation in which the small forester is going to land if the development takes place in such a manner that it will become more and more difficult for him to survive. The hon. member for Carletonville also came back again to a point which he has made before, but everything deals with the concern in the minds of all of us, outside this House as well, about what the position is going to be years from now, since we know that the demand for timber is growing at a very high tempo but that it is difficult to visualize how South Africa will be able to keep pace with the provision at such a tempo. For that reason I think that in replying to the hon. members, I should once again present a picture of how this development has taken place and how I consider we should view it at the present moment.</p>

<p>You will know, Sir, that the State has from time to time laid down its policy in regard to afforestation in general, and that it has from time to time made calculations of what the situation should be. The first calculation which was made by the State and on the basis of which it did in fact give an indication of the tempo at which afforestation had to take place in South Africa, was made in the early thirties. At that stage, in the light we had at the time, and in the light of the faith we then had in the future, we thought that it would be more than adequate for South Africa if it were afforested at a tempo of 6,500 hectares a year for the next 25 years as from that moment. But within 10 years after that, it had to review the situation, and at that time it decided that the tempo at which it had to cause afforestation to take place, was not to be 6,500 hectares a year but at least 14,500 hectares for the next 25 years. In the early sixties we took another look at the picture, and at that stage, with the experience we had gained by the time, it was already very clear that certain facts were not at our disposal when we followed the old method of making surveys. But even at that stage people were anxious for us to indicate in our forestry legislation a course along which it would be possible to deal more effectively with the coming situation, and in 1968 that legislation was in fact introduced here and today references were also made to that legislation. This legislation provided that surveys of the situation had to be made on a continuous basis, that they had to be kept up to date, that they had to be at the disposal of the Department of Forestry and that it had to adapt those facts in regard to the situation as it existed and <span class="col_1779-1780" refersTo="page_0903"/>project them into the future so that they might be available to the whole industry and to the whole country and also to the Government, so that we may know in what direction we are moving.</p>

<p>Subsequently the first surveys were made in 1969&#x2014;the other day. Out of what emerged as a result of those surveys, we now know, in the first place, that we have already landed in a situation where we now have to plan rapidly since we are faced with major shortages in the future. Although we can, with the facts at our disposal, draw such a conclusion and also put it beyond all doubt, it is, in view of the refinement which will be brought about by means of the analysis, still not quite clear at this moment, but it will be clear soon, what these shortages and the nuances thereof will be, within this general situation of shortages. What is involved here, is sites for plantations, quantities, quality and the demand which is going to emerge in the various parts of the processing sector. In other words, in this vast industry we must give these projections to everybody who is involved in the processing of the product, and the State must, on its own and with outside assistance, try to keep up to date. Therefore, we know that we are going to have a major shortage. When the hon. member for Humansdorp made a calculation of the present situation, and also of the future position as he sees it, he was probably making us of figures he had obtained from the private sector, figures relating to the quantities being sold at present as well as the unsold parts of our timber production. On that basis he proceeded to draw the conclusion which he expressed here in figures today.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that it is dangerous to draw such a conclusion on the basis of a set of figures for one single year. It is also dangerous to add up the sales figures and the figures in respect of the present available supplies and then to draw a conclusion on that basis. We prefer to multiply the area planted by the growth per unit&#x2014;for instance, the growth per acre or the growth per morgen&#x2014;and then to obtain a projection for the future. If that is done, the position looks somewhat better than the one he visualizes. However, I must admit that even then it does not look good. We believe that a shortage is going to develop in the next 15 years&#x2019; time, and that we shall have to make provision for it, but we also believe that we shall at least be in the position soon to study the matter in greater detail and to plan accordingly.</p>

<p>In talking about a situation which is in the process of developing, we must determine from what direction a rectification is going to be forthcoming. That rectification must be a rectification of possible shortages in the future. That rectification can be forthcoming from either of two directions. It can only come about as a result of the planting of new resources, or as a result of imports. As far as new resources are concerned, we should have regard to the fact that new resources also imply increased competition for the water supplies of South Africa. Therefore, a limiting factor is already implied in that solution. As far as possible imports are concerned, we must have regard to a world situation in which timber is also going to become scarce and expensive. It may also become more difficult for us to obtain supplies. However, the possibility of imports from our neighbouring states may also be kept in mind. Here we are thinking of Swaziland, for instance. Swaziland, with its supplies, is supplementing our supplies, and there is fairly free access to South Africa within certain limits. As far as the future is concerned, we shall therefore have to correlate our own situation with that of Swaziland, the Transkei and other areas as well. I myself do not see anything wrong in our becoming much more closely integrated with each other as far as timber supplies are concerned. To my mind this is a sphere in which it will be possible for us to co-operate very well with each other in the future.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with an industry which, because of certain very important reasons, is of the greatest importance to us. In the first place, we must bear in mind that forestry in South Africa is a strategic industry. It has become absolutely strategic, and it will always remain so. In the second place, we must bear in mind that forestry in South Africa, particularly as regards the development of the allied secondary industries, has become a giant, and that there are a very large number of industries which have been integrated with it. It may interest the House if I pointed out that in forestry the value of the available raw material will have increased tenfold by the time the product eventually appears in its final form. In other words, this is an industry which generates economic development in itself. There are few industries of which it can be said that their raw materials <span class="col_1781-1782" refersTo="page_0904"/>are responsible for a tenfold increase of the contribution to the country&#x2019;s economy. The industry is, therefore, a very important one. It is also an extremely important industry to us because the timber industry is a self-generating one. Its raw materials and resources cannot be exhausted; they are continuously being replaced. If this is compared with the mining industry, we must bear in mind that investment in forestry does not mean an investment until it has been exhausted, as a mine is exhausted. It is an investment and an industry which will be available for all time to come. It generates itself. It is, therefore, an extremely important industry.</p>

<p>In the specific situation of South Africa forestry is very important because it is so labour-intensive. It is an industry which lends itself so easily to providing many people in South Africa with a means of gaining a livelihood. At the moment hundreds of thousands of people are working in the forestry industry in South Africa. For these reasons it is an industry which is sufficiently important to be treated in the national economy with such respect and importance as are necessary and are its due. But the key question is: Where are those trees, which South Africa will need in the future, to be planted&#x003F; In a country such as South Africa there is keen competition and various factors making it extremely difficult to take a decision in this regard. For that reason we shall have to consider the factors involved here. In the first place, the physical circumstances of the site itself, i.e. the place where the trees are to grow, are extremely important. I say this because two things are needed in the production of timber, i.e. soil and water. As far as water is concerned, we are already in a position which involves our having to be very careful. We do have at our disposal extensive catchment areas, where there is a high rainfall. We need at least 800 mm or 32 inches of rain per year for our forests to yield a good production. Suitable areas in South Africa, areas with a rainfall higher than this, are not so plentiful. In these high rainfall areas there are parts which are not suitable for forestry. It may be the topography, climate, or soil depth is not suitable. There are, in addition, other factors which may render such areas unsuitable for afforestation. Those areas are the natural water conservation areas. Such areas will be protected and administered by the Department of Forestry as catchment areas for supplying the country with water.</p>

<p>But there are also other areas which have major water supplies and in respect of which the Department of Forestry has to take great care not to allow unrestricted development. These are areas in which large quantities of water are available but in which large, established communities have already developed or in which the water resources are required for sustaining large and important communities. In such cases it is in the national interest that the water supply be given priority over the production of timber. As far as the soil is concerned, there is competition, too. We must produce food. We must also produce raw materials other than food. One of the hon. members, I think it was the hon. member for Mooi River, referred to this aspect. I want to tell him that we can do no other than regard forestry as forming part of the agricultural sector; it occupies a legitimate place in the agricultural sector. As far as our basic supplies are concerned, I believe that all the supplies which are not required for the essential production of food, could be afforested in competition with any other product which could be exported or which could be consumed domestically. We must therefore acknowledge that there has to be a niche for forestry within the limits imposed by soil and water and the right to give, within the broad requirements of the country as a whole, top priority to those production factors which are nearest and most important to it, such as water.</p>

<p>Having looked at the physical circumstances, we may also look at the general circumstances in regard to forestry. It is not so easy to make a projection in regard to the production of timber. This is true, for there are two important requirements for proper forestry. In the first place, a good soil-depth must be available and furthermore it requires all the physical qualities that should be associated with it. Without great prolixity I want to tell the hon. members that if we look at South Africa, it seems to us that the parts to which we are to look in the future for the production of timber, are the foothills of our mountainous areas. The foothills have the soil depth and, what is more, that soil, as far as its chemical composition is concerned, probably lends itself easily to the production of forestry products, much rather than to the production of other agricultural products. I am thinking of the <span class="col_1783-1784" refersTo="page_0905"/>foothills of the Drakensberg mountain range. But we should also take a look at the parts along our coastline where forestry would be the smallest consumer of water. If we look at the map of South Africa, it seems to me as though we should look to the eastern parts of our country, parts situated along the foothills of the mountains, and to the coastal areas of the Eastern Cape, Natal and Zululand for further forestry expansion. It is also likely that there are other areas where we can expand this industry, but I think that these areas are the areas we should consider.</p>

<p>Once we have looked at the natural circumstances, there are still the economic circumstances which have to be assessed by us in looking for new areas for the forestry industry. We should note that it is also possible for the forestry industry to fit into the pattern of our decentralization policy and our border development policy. It is an industry which lends itself to creating permanent growth points in those parts where the people are who have to be employed. In this sense the forestry industry is a key industry in South Africa. Although we are in the future not going to couple our decentralization policy with the forestry development alone, it can play a major part in the development of the future. In the second place, there is another economic factor which has to be considered. This factor is that our large industrial complexes, our existing large factories and all our factories which use timber products, are not always properly situated in South Africa. There are a number of them which are in economic difficulties in view of the fact that in regard to their location in respect of transport, proximity to markets and proximity to raw materials they cannot always compete economically with other factories in the industry. In other words, in future we shall have to take good care that the development takes place where the sound and the obvious growth factors for economic development are available, and where it fits into the broad pattern. In developing the industry, we shall also have to consider the fact that in certain parts of our country there is scattered development of quite a number of smaller farmers, who, by virtue of the fact that their farms are situated wrongly and scattered to that extent, cannot make an economic living either. In other words, if we are looking for development, we shall have to do either of two things. We shall have to consolidate these areas and develop and plan them together with those which are already in existence, or we shall have to remove the existing plantations and establish them where they will comply with the best and primary norms of economic viability. We must, in other words, have regard to all of these factors. Therefore, you can see, Sir, that it is not so easy to talk about the general afforestation policy, for we have to contend with the competition of water, soil and the factors of economic viability, which have already become established. We also have to contend with the factors of economic viability which are going to emerge once we have made a start. In other words, to look at the picture of South Africa as far as afforestation is concerned, implies an intensive study. It means that we have to look at it on a broad, planned basis, so that we may now lay the foundations for the development which has to come and not only prevent the catastrophes foreshadowed by hon. gentlemen who spoke here today, but also ensure that the road leading to the target will be as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell hon. members that forestry in South Africa has become one of the major industries, one of the giants. I do not wish to repeat figures that were mentioned here earlier on today, but I want to tell hon. members, with reference to what I mentioned to them a moment ago, that forestry is an industry which, from its raw materials, generates a tenfold increase of economic development. I want to add that if we had to be deprived of that development which exists in South Africa at the moment and if, in the place of all those raw materials and what goes hand in hand with them we had to import in order to have in South Africa the same development which is being coupled with the forestry industry today, it would mean, if we were to convert it and project it for the next ten years, that South Africa would from now until ten years from now have to import a minimum of R4,000 million, an amount which would have had to be made available in terms of foreign exchange. Hon. members can therefore see that this industry means a tremendously great deal to the economy of South Africa. If hon. members consider that for the year that lies ahead we would have to raise extra foreign exchange at an average of R400 million a year in order to replace all the products and related products which would not have been there if we did not have the forestry industry, they can make <span class="col_1785-1786" refersTo="page_0906"/>a calculation of what this means for the economy of South Africa. Since I consider it to be of such urgent importance that we should now obtain the picture of development for the future, that we should obtain the co-ordination of all bodies and persons to co-operate in order that that projection may not only be seen, but also to stimulate development into the direction it has to take so that the right steps may be taken in good time, I have decided&#x2014;and I take pleasure in announcing this&#x2014;to appoint an inter-departmental committee for the purpose of indicating priority areas for afforestation in South Africa. The terms of reference of this committee are to inquire into and to report and make recommendations on every aspect of the Republic&#x2019;s present and future timber requirements and how they can be met, with special reference to the following aspects&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1. The available timber resources and the present requirements in respect of timber and timber derivatives;</li>

<li>2. The trend in regard to the future timber requirements of the country, the determination, on this basis, of the surface area which will be required for timber production in order to keep pace with these requirements;</li>

<li>3. The role that can be played by neighbouring states and Bantu homeland areas by way of supplementing the future timber requirements of the Republic, and the desirability of integrating, on a planned basis, the yields from these timber resources with the local timber production;</li>

<li>4. The determination of the areas where afforestation should be allowed and encouraged, having regard to the following: (i) that the natural production factors of climate and soil ought to be such that they will justify afforestation on a commercial scale; (ii) that any recommended area should be extensive enough to meet at least the present norms of economic units for processing industries; and (iii) that the Water Plan Commission&#x2019;s recommendations relating to priorities in regard to the utilization of water, will serve as a guide;</li>

<li>5. The desirability for the State itself to take the initiative to purchase land and to undertake afforestation within such areas in order to make them economically viable;</li>

<li>6. The prices at which land for afforestation purposes may be purchased, regard being had to the progressive increase in land prices; and</li>

<li>7. Any other matter which the Committee may encounter in carrying out its investigations and to which it may consider it necessary to pay attention.</li>

</ol>

<p>Having said that, I want to make a few observations in connection with the whole situation regarding marginal land. If we are only going to look for select land in South Africa and to adopt the attitude that land which is not typically ideal for the production of trees, should not be purchased, I am afraid that we shall probably not obtain sufficient land on which the necessary afforestation can be undertaken. I believe that at this stage we should also proceed to purchasing marginal land, provided that such land is not predominantly marginal, but partly marginal. Furthermore, I want to say that if we were to make a projection of a growth rate of 2 per cent per year for the future and if we have regard to the general world shortage of timber that awaits us and the importance of timber for the South African economy, I think that we should not adopt the attitude which is being adopted so easily and may have been adopted in the past when the State was dealing with a situation, i.e. to judge now what it will cost at current prices to purchase land. But I think we should rather consider what such an investment which is self-generating, an investment which is so labour-intensive, an investment which is making such a major contribution towards stimulating the economy of the country in the future, an investment which, above all, saves us so much foreign exchange, will mean to us. I think we should take all of these things into account and purchase land at current prices, for that land will be much more expensive in the future. In the interests of this development we should acquire that land now so that South Africa may own it in the future, should we require it then. That is why I believe that these terms of reference are correct and good ones. We should also <span class="col_1787-1788" refersTo="page_0907"/>take a close look at the question of the cost of land, and in this respect we should have just as much faith in the future as the Government had way back when it decided to undertake afforestation in South Africa for the first time.</p>

<p>That is why I say that in calculating the cost of purchasing such land we should not merely calculate it with regard to the situation as it exists at present. We shall have to make a projection for the future. We know that an investment today will be an investment which will gain more and more value in the future. We shall have to have regard to what such an investment today may mean in the total economy for South Africa for the future. That is why I have great confidence in appointing this committee and why it has been a pleasant privilege to me to be able to announce it.</p>

<heading>MOTION ON IMMORALITY ACT AND MIXED MARRIAGES ACT</heading>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I move the motion standing in my name on page 91 of the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in the opinion of this House section 16 of the Immorality Act (Act No. 23 of 1957) and the Mixed Marriages Act (Act No. 55 of 1949) should be repealed forthwith.</block>

<p>As hon. members will know, nine years ago almost to the day I introduced a Private Member&#x2019;s Bill in this House to repeal section 16 of Act No. 23 of 1957. Section 16 is of course the section that governs interracial sex relations, i.e. sex relations across the colour-line, and makes it an offence which on conviction is punishable by a maximum sentence of up to seven years&#x2019; imprisonment. I want to say that in most cases this heavy sentence is not imposed. Generally a sentence of six months&#x2019; imprisonment is imposed and even this is often suspended. I make no excuse for re-introducing a motion nine years later, a motion which is very much the same as the one I introduced before. A great deal has happened in the world since 1962. Man has reached the moon, for instance. It is just possible that hon. members in this House may have changed their views on this particular question. It is possible that they might have advanced sufficiently in their thinking to re-assess the value of a law which more than almost any other law, just because it is a highly charged emotional issue concerning colour and involving the most intimate of human relations, has brought notoriety and ridicule upon South Africa. Hon. members will have noticed that together with the repeal of section 16 of the Immorality Act I have included in the motion the repeal forthwith the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act (Act 55 of 1949). I believe it is consequential to do this. This Act is the one which prohibits marriage between Whites and Non-Whites. I said this in 1962 when I introduced my Private Member&#x2019;s Bill and the then Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, agreed with this proposition. He argued that if he had accepted my Bill to repeal section 16 of the Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act remained on the Statute Book, and I quote him now &#x201C;the result would be that this House would be placing its stamp of approval on the conduct of unmarried people who give free rein to their carnal pleasures &#x2026;&#x201D; he meant across the Colour-line of course &#x2026; &#x201C;while denying the right to people to live together in decency as married couples&#x201D;. The original Minister who introduced the Immorality Act in 1950 also agreed with this when he introduced that as a corollary to the Mixed Marriages Act of 1949. He summed it up very neatly by saying that we would otherwise &#x201C;be placing a premium on immorality&#x201D;. That is right and I agree with it. When I introduced my Bill in 1962 I said: &#x201C;I must obviously advocate the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 because it is quite wrong to make it legally impossible for people to sanctify in marriage, relations which are legally admissible in extra-marital relations.&#x201D; In other words, it should obviously not be illegal for people to marry when it is legal for them to live together illicitly. Just as section 16 of the Immorality Act was a natural corollary of the Mixed Marriages Act of 1949 so I believe is the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act a corollary of the repeal of section 16 of the Immorality Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_1789-1790" refersTo="page_0908"/>I want to say at once that I am not panic-stricken at the thought of a South Africa without the Mixed Marriages Act. Strangely enough, we got along very well indeed before it was passed and I am pretty sure that racial purity would not be endangered after it is repealed. It is not the Mixed Marriages Act that saved White South Africa, as figures show. Less than one per cent of Whites contracted marriages across the Colour-line in 1935. Less than 3 per 1,000 of all races contracted mixed marriages in 1936, according to the report of the Mixed Marriages Commission. In the year before the Act was passed, i.e. in 1948, only seventy mixed marriages were contracted in the whole of South Africa. Sir, does anybody in this House believe that if the Mixed Marriages Act were repealed there would be hundreds of people rushing to the altar to enter into mixed marriages&#x003F; When one thinks of the consequences of crossing the colour line in South Africa, a White person who enters into a mixed marriage must indeed be utterly committed, I believe, to the non-White partner to contemplate such a step. Apart from the social penalties, which are very great indeed, the laws which have been put on the Statute Book with monotonous regularity ever since the Mixed Marriage Act was passed, bear very heavily indeed on anyone who crosses the colour line from White to Coloured, and even more if he or she crosses the colour line from White to African. The Separate Amenities Act and the Group Areas Act immediately lower their status and privileges. They cannot live in or own property in a White area. They cannot enjoy White amenities together with their spouses. But, Sir, the future implications are much worse&#x2014;the implications to their children&#x2014;for the Population Registration Act classifies them forever as second class citizens. It means that they lose their franchise in this House; they get no free and compulsory education; and the disadvantages of job reservation and racial discrimination immediately descend upon them.</p>

<p>I say therefore that by the very nature of things in South Africa, it is highly unlikely that there will be a wild rush to the altar of couples wishing to contract mixed marriages if the House accepts this motion today. I also say that those few couples who are prepared to accept all the grim implications of marriage across the colour line in South Africa must want very much indeed to have an enduring relationship and I say that then it is their business and their business alone. This vicious Act&#x2014;for it is vicious in many ways&#x2014;makes absolutely no allowance whatever for enduring relationships across the colour line; I am talking now about the Immorality Act. We have had case after case; we had one case where a White man and a Chinese woman have been living together for 18 years. They have four children, the eldest of whom is 14, and they were charged under the Immorality Act. Then there is the case of the White man and the Coloured girl aged 20 who were married in England in 1967. They had two children and they were convicted in the magistrate&#x2019;s court in 1969 under the Immorality Act. The conviction was set aside on appeal because the wife was obviously White in appearance. We have this strange definition in this Act. We have many definitions to suit different Acts; we have a chameleon-like quality in South Africa on colour definitions. The wife was classified as Coloured because her birth certificate showed that the parents were mixed. We had the notorious Jacqueson case which resulted in tremendous adverse overseas publicity for South Africa. All of us in this House remember it, Sir. There were columns and columns in the overseas newspapers about the English girl who had married an Indian South African. They came back here and were charged under the Immorality Act.</p>

<p>I anticipate that at some stage during this debate somebody is going to say to me, &#x201C;Are you in favour of miscegenation&#x003F;&#x201D; I am quite sure that this thought has already crossed the minds of many sitting in this House. Sir. my reply to that is that I am no more in favour of miscegenation than members of the Nationalist Party are in favour of immorality that has nothing to do with the mixture of races. Sexual intercourse between unmarried persons of the same race constitutes immorality; adultery constitutes immorality but there are no laws on our Statute Book which make these forms of immorality a crime. Indeed, Sir, until 1927 when the Tielman Roos Act, as it was known, was passed, there was no Union-wide law against sexual relations across the colour line between Whites and Blacks, and until 1950 there was no law at all against sexual relations between White and Coloured persons. That was when the Immorality Act was extended to include all non-White persons and not just sexual relations between White and Black. It might astonish hon. members to <span class="col_1791-1792" refersTo="page_0909"/>know that until 1949 there was no law against mixed marriages in South Africa. There was no machinery for mixed marriages in the Transvaal, but there was no law against the contraction of mixed marriages until 1949. Does one assume that until those dates South Africa was in favour of miscegenation&#x003F; The old Roman-Dutch law which made adultery a criminal offence was abrogated by disuse long ago in South Africa. The last adultery trial took place in South Africa nearly 60 years ago, in 1914, the case of Green v. Fitzgerald. Prior to that, it was remarked, there had been no criminal prosecutions for adultery in South Africa since 1828. Does this mean, Sir, that for the last 60 to 150 years South Africa has approved of adultery&#x003F; There is no law against adultery. Illicit sexual relations not across the colour line carry no criminal sanctions either, unless, of course, the girl is under age or mentally retarded. Does this mean that members opposite are in favour of such illicit sexual relations&#x003F; Of course not.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then you should call it the Miscegenation Act but in fact it is section 16 of the Immorality Act and it is known as the Immorality Act throughout this country. Sir, what it does mean is that even members opposite realize that there are certain actions which, even though disapproved of and even though they may be an affront to society, ought not to carry criminal sanctions. It is not possible to make every immoral or even undesirable act such as miscegenation a crime. One has to draw the line somewhere and in a case of extra-marital sexual relations and immorality not affecting colour, the line has been drawn in such a way that if the conduct of two people does not really affect society as a whole, their actions are not subject to criminal sanctions. Judge Rose-Innes, in giving judgment in that last adultery case, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The disuse of this law is due to the fact that public opinion has for long recognized the advisability of leaving the offence to be dealt with by the sanctions of morality and religion rather than by those of the criminal law.</block>

<p>The case that I am trying to make out now is exactly the same: it applies to immorality across the colour line.</p>

<p>Sir, in the nearly 21 years that the Immorality Act has been on the Statute Book more than 8,485 people have been convicted under section 16; more than twice that number have been charged under section 16. That makes an average of four per working day, every single day. That was the situation last year in particular. Less than half the people charged have been found guilty in almost every year. I might say that there has been a sharp increase in the number of people who have been prosecuted and found guilty since 1957, and that is because in 1957 amendments were introduced into this House that brought attempts or incitement to commit any indecent or immoral act across the colour line within the purview of section 16. That meant that it was considerably broadened in its scope and there were many more prosecutions and many more people were found guilty.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has referred to the Immorality Act as &#x201C;die kleinste van klein apartheid&#x201D;, and in the sense in which he used that expression I will not quarrel with it. But to my mind it is one of the cruellest Acts on our Statute Book. Hardly a week goes by without one&#x2019;s reading sickening reports of the misery and degradation that it has brought to family after family&#x2014;broken marriages and suicides. The ravages of this measure on human lives can be gauged by a most cursory glance at the newspapers. Hardly a day goes by that one does not pick up a newspaper without coming across some sickening headline. I might say that even acquittal under the Immorality Act means a lasting stigma on the accused. A retired police officer who was acquitted of a charge under the Immorality Act some years ago said, &#x201C;I would rather be charged with murder&#x201D;. Sir, will those involved in the Excelsior fiasco ever forget what happened to them&#x003F; Will they ever be allowed to forget what happened to them&#x003F; Judge Schreiner remarked some years ago that miscegenation has been elevated into a crime so atrocious as to make all other crimes relatively venial. Let me give the House a few examples of what this Act has done to people. Between 1958 and 1968 at least ten cases of suicide of White men who had been prosecuted under section 16 were reported. One, a 65-year old man, killed himself by pouring petrol over himself and setting himself alight. One man killed not only himself but his two children also. Between October, 1970, and February, 1971, <span class="col_1793-1794" refersTo="page_0910"/>at least five men have committed suicide after being charged under section 16. One of them of course was in the Excelsior case. We see headline after headline, like &#x201C;Father of four hangs himself in police cell&#x201D;, &#x201C;Man of 63 gases himself&#x201D;, &#x201C;Wife slams evil morals law. &#x2018;I stand by my husband&#x2019;.&#x201D; So the headlines read. Sir, when all the heated words have been said, what exactly does this law do&#x003F; It punishes, and that is sufficient reason for its retention for many of the hon. members opposite, because many of them are very vengeful people. The punishment that society will inflict on transgressors of the social code is not enough for them. The whole ugly drama has to be enacted right to the last scene, the court scene, where the public disgrace may be translated into a prison sentence. And of course there are the crowds of sadistic and sensation-craving people who pack the courts, and the world press prints all the salacious details to South Africa&#x2019;s detriment. I am told that something like 31 newspapermen and television men converged on Excelsior in order to report this case.</p>

<p>Now we are told solemnly and sanctimoniously that the law is there to preserve the White man&#x2019;s identity. I ask whether the White man needs a law to preserve his identity. If the answer is yes, then I say the White man&#x2019;s identity will not be preserved. It is true, of course, that when the original Act was introduced and when the 1957 amendments were introduced, the then Minister of Justice denied hotly that this law was necessary for South Africans. It is true, he said, that there are some weaklings who need some protection from their baser instincts. This was Mr. Swart, when he was Minister of Justice. He said the only reason for the legislation was not that &#x201C;we as South Africans could not behave ourselves, but we needed legislation for the foreigners who came here and who did not have the same sentiments that we had&#x201D;. Well, I am glad to say that we do not hear this argument any more. That is gone. What we hear, of course, are thunderings against the permissive society. Well, that is at least a little more honest because the facts would certainly not bear out the contention that mainly foreigners are involved in immorality cases. Good old South African names are for the most part involved.</p>

<p>Now there was one argument in favour of section 16 which was used by the then Minister of Justice, the present Prime Minister, when I introduced my Bill in 1962. I call it the &#x201C;protection&#x201D; argument. He said that the Immorality Act protected Bantu and Coloured girls against unscrupulous people who had money and influence and position, and he said that Coloured and Bantu parents are grateful to the Government for protecting their daughters. Well, that may be true of the African people. I do not know. I doubt it myself, but I cannot say that I know for certain. But as recently as 28th January this year spokesmen of both the major Coloured political parties bitterly attacked and demanded the repeal of the Immorality Act. The Coloured Representative Council demanded the repeal of the Immorality Act. Now I would say, too, that there are other laws to protect the daughters of Africans and Coloureds. There are laws against rape, including sexual intercourse under duress. Indeed, only a little while ago we had a case where a traffic officer abused his position and took advantage of his position of authority in order to have sexual intercourse with an African woman. The Judge was extremely strict about this and sentenced the man to eight years&#x2019; imprisonment for raping this woman. Although she had suffered no harm, the evidence was that she had submitted to the man because of his uniform and his position of authority. There are laws against it. There are laws against prostitution, and as for non-White women who agree to sexual intercourse across the colour line, the law does not protect them; the law punishes them. They go to gaol, and sometimes they go to gaol while the White male gets off scotfree because he is defended and the woman is not. There have been cases where six African women were convicted while the White co-accused were discharged, and we have had other cases where African women have gone to gaol and the sentences of the White men were in fact suspended, in one case because of the man&#x2019;s age.</p>

<p>In the end the argument comes down to the law as a deterrent, and here I do not think anybody can speak with any great certainty. Is it the penalty that the law will impose which is the deterrent, or is it the fear of being found out that is the deterrent&#x003F; Is the urge to have sexual relations across the colour line so strong that miscegenation will increase greatly throughout the length and breadth of the country if this motion is accepted despite all the social taboos and the strong adverse emotions&#x003F; Is it not rather ironic to be trying <span class="col_1795-1796" refersTo="page_0911"/>to stop miscegenation in this way in a country where 2 million people are already of mixed blood&#x003F;</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the law should not be repealed, but that there should rather be a full-scale commission of inquiry appointed to go into the administration of the Act. I know that in 1962 the United Party asked for a select committee of this House to be appointed. I gather from what the United Party has been saying that it would now like a judicial commission. I have no doubt that one of its spokesmen will tell me why they have altered their request. I assume, however, that neither the hon. member for Durban North nor the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is going to provide this answer, since both of them are on record as saying that this is a vicious law which should be scrapped. Unless they have been misquoted in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> both of them have said that the Immorality Law must be scrapped. I quote: &#x201C;Immorality Law must be scrapped, says Mr. Basson.&#x201D; According to this newspaper, the hon. member for Durban North said: &#x201C;The Immorality Act is an unnecessary Act and the White race has maintained its identity by its own inherent strength and its own moral code. One does not need laws to do it.&#x201D; However, no doubt somebody from the U.P. will tell us why they now want an inquiry.</p>

<p>Sir, can section 16 be improved by better administration&#x003F; I very much doubt it. For one thing, this repulsive law can only be enforced by the most degrading means. Both parties in terms of this section are guilty of a crime and in the vast majority of cases such an offence can only be detected by informers spying on their neighbours, as apparently happened in Excelsior, by policemen acting as peeping toms, peering into parked cars or climbing trees, or looking into bedrooms. I maintain that they could be better employed tracking down the perpetrators of violent crimes. The Police can only track these offenders down by the more degrading methods of feeling the sheets of beds to see if they are still warm, not to mention making suspects submit to medical examination to determine whether or not intercourse has taken place. I am glad to say that recently we have had no further cases of Black women being used as traps in immorality cases. I am very glad that that practice has been discontinued. I do not believe that a law like this can be &#x201C;nicely&#x201D; administered.</p>

<p>Exercising great care before prosecution is another method that has been suggested. Sir, this instruction was given years ago. I remember that the Minister in 1962 assured the House that Attorneys-General and the prosecutors &#x201C;exercise the greatest care in deciding in connection with these cases whether they should prosecute or whether they should not prosecute&#x201D;. So, despite Excelsior, which I believe was the finest example of official bungling since the Immorality Act was passed in 1950, I do not think we need an inquiry to establish the fact that there are people who are charged under the Immorality Act who should not have been, despite the special care that is supposed to be exercised. I do not know how you go further than instructing people to exercise the greatest possible care. While I am mentioning Excelsior, I wonder if the hon. the Minister would like to take the opportunity of commenting upon a report which appeared in the <i>London Observer.</i> I have no doubt that he has seen it. The <i>Observer</i> is a very widely read newspaper. The article gives the following reason for the withdrawal of proceedings at Excelsior and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An astute Afrikaner lawyer, a staunch member of the ruling Nationalist Party and a firm supporter of apartheid, who represented several of the White and African accused, told me that he discovered that some of the African girls whom the State were going to produce as witnesses, were beaten up by White and Black policemen while in jail to extract confessions that they had had intercourse with the farmers.</block>

<p>In other words, this means that these forced confessions were the main reason why these women could not be brought to court. I think the hon. the Minister ought to take this opportunity of refuting this report if it is not true. I think at the same time he ought to tell us why the other 30 witnesses who were willing to testify and who were not accomplices were not called. Perhaps he would also like to tell us why it is that the women accused at Excelsior were held in jail awaiting trial if in fact there was no evidence against them.</p>

<p>A third suggestion has been made for a way in which to offset the public degradation that follows charges in the courts of law, <b>and that is to hold trials <i>in camera</i></b> This is another suggestion that has been <span class="col_1797-1798" refersTo="page_0912"/>made over the years. I want to say at once that I am against this form of evasion of the consequences of the law. Every person who is charged with a crime, must endure the odium of publicity. It is, of course, our excessive preoccupation with colour which makes this crime a particularly heinous one, one which brings in its wake a particularly lurid form of sensationalism and social ostracism. I do not believe that closing the courts and holding trials <i>in camera</i> will help. I think that rumour and speculation as to the identity of the people charged will be rife. I say that either section 16 of the Immorality Act is a good law and should remain on the Statute Book, in which case it ought to stand the test of open trial in the court, which I think is a corner-stone of justice, or it is a law which ought not to be on our Statute Book, in which case it ought to be repealed. I do not think that secret trials to cover the ugliness of the Immorality Act or anonymity to protect those prosecuted is a good suggestion. I believe that that is tinkering with normal criminal procedures and with the administration of justice in a most dangerous way.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not think we need an inquiry or select committee, as we know all the facts and misery which the Immorality Act has caused over the years. I have newspaper cutting after newspaper cutting written by highly qualified people, who all call for the repeal of the Act. There are those who ask for an inquiry. For every one asking for an inquiry, I can match it with an equally reputable person who calls for a repeal of that Act. We know that for the Immorality Act to be implemented, requires use of the most unpleasant methods. There is no nice way to implement this crude law. We know that, with exercise of the greatest care, bungling takes place. We know too that the law, as an instrument of social control, is at best a clumsy instrument. As long as society frowns on miscegenation in South Africa, there will not be a great deal of miscegenation. There will inevitably be some on the fringes but there will not be a great deal of it. I believe that if social conventions and its moral and religious strictures cannot control social behaviour regarding sex across the colour line no law will be able to do it. We know that this law has brought in its wake nothing but misery and degradation. It is a blackmailer&#x2019;s delight. We know that thousands of people have been affected and had their lives ruined and their families wrecked by being dragged into court for an act which is only a crime because colour is involved. We know too that this measure and its corollary, the Mixed Marriages Act, have brought shame and notoriety on South Africa at home and abroad.</p>

<p>It is my contention, Sir, that political leaders should lead and not lag behind public opinion. I am sure that, as far as section 16 of the Immorality Act is concerned, this House lags far behind public opinion. I believe that it lags behind the English as well as the Afrikaans Press. It lags behind a broad section of the public which has grown increasingly disgusted with this law. I believe further that there is only one course of action we should follow, namely to repeal section 16 of the Immorality Act and the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. I want to conclude by saying that I think a matter such as this one should not be a matter of party politics. I believe that this should be discussed across the floor of this House with the utmost freedom and without any of the shackles of the party whip. I ask that both major parties, the Nationalist Party and the United Party, allow this motion to come to a vote and that a free vote be allowed on this motion in the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>It was with interest that I listened to the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s speech in regard to this Immorality Act and the Mixed Marriages Act. If I followed her argument correctly, it seems to me that the hon. member&#x2019;s standpoint is based exclusively on the argument that we should not have this Act on the Statute Book, but that there should exclusively be an ethical and moral sanction against this deed. The hon. member went on to furnish us with a lot of, one can almost say bloody, details of certain incidents arising out of this Act. She again made the statement that opinion overseas is mounting tremendously against South Africa in regard to this Immorality Act. She also said that the suffering and sorrow which such crime could cause, was quite sufficient to have this Act scrapped from the Statute Book. Every law which is contravened and every serious crime which is committed brings suffering and sorrow to the criminal his family and to all those dependent on him. This applies to every aspect of his life, and it brings about a complete change in his life. This does not apply only to the Immorality Act. That is why that argument of the hon. member is <span class="col_1799-1800" refersTo="page_0913"/>not a valid one. It is a general statement that everyone who is found guilty of committing a serious crime causes a measure of sorrow, and that they commit their crime as a calculated risk.</p>

<p>As far as overseas opinion is concerned, I am afraid that the hon. member for Houghton makes the mistake of emphasizing this entire position and of basing her standpoint on the standpoint of a European. I want to put it to hon. members in this way, i.e. that in Europe there are no sanctions against miscegenation as such. The hon. member adopts that same premise, i.e. that there is nothing wrong with miscegenation. This is an un-South African standpoint. It is a European norm which is only valid in Europe. I must concede to the hon. member that I am a person who gives very serious thought to the matter when it comes to overseas opinion. I am very eager to have people overseas understand the situation in South Africa correctly. It need not, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be favourable, they must simply understand it correctly. I am a great stickler for this, but in this specific case the hon. member must not forget that there are two different norms. The hon. member makes the mistake of adopting a premise here which maintains that there is nothing wrong with miscegenation as such. That is a mistake, because in South Africa there is a different social norm. In South Africa there is a norm, established in the course of our history, which maintains that no immoral acts may be committed between Whites and non-Whites. When a country feels strongly about a social offence, this offence must through legislation be construed as a crime in order to give expression to the feeling of its people. If I may formulate it like this, a crime is a deed which is committed in contravention of the social and moral norms of a people. In this case one can say without fear of contradiction that in South Africa there is a deeply-rooted aversion to miscegenation between Whites and non-Whites. No matter what we did, the criticism abroad would continue. We would have to abolish the entire Act if we wanted to avoid all that criticism, because the norms are different. Here in South Africa we feel that we must act in this way, and people from overseas view us from a different standpoint, because in their country the same social circumstances which justify such a norm do not exist. When those people come to South Africa from abroad, one can observe that within a month they tell us that they understand why we do not want a miscegenation between White and non-White. They can see that the background, the people and the historical development is different. They can appreciate why we have built up such a norm which lays down that miscegenation is an evil.</p>

<p>The hon. member told us about the suicides. I have a great deal of sympathy with people who have suffered under this Act, and who committed an offence under the Act. My attitude towards people is not a callous one, but the fact that people commit suicide means in actual fact that they realize that they have contravened a code of social behaviour. That means that that code of social behaviour is so strong that it can move a man to commit suicide. That is once again the justification for this Act. It is proof that this Act is rooted in South African social norms. Apart from the Act itself, the mere fact that a stigma attaches to the person is enough to drive him to suicide. If there was ever justification for an Act, it is the incidents mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton. That is why I want to tell her that seen from the point of view of the norms of South Africa there is no possibility of this Act being abolished, because such a move would be completely at variance with the feelings of our people.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the application of this Act. This Act is of course, as with all acts, applied by our Police and by our courts. I want to say at once that we must never forget that in a Police Force of 30,000 members, those men whom we have put into uniform will not in every possible case act as if they were parade ground soldiers who have never made a mistake in their lives. We have here a Force of 35,000 people, among whom there must be people who are sometimes guilty of dereliction of duty, sometimes of negligence and sometimes even of deliberate ill-intent. But this does not mean that our Police Force in these specific cases acts in the manner the hon. member for Houghton wants to impute to them, that they act brutally, feel the temperature of the blankets, etc.</p>

<speech by="#kruger">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. T. KRUGER</person>:</from>

<p>These people must do it. They have no choice. They find it as unpleasant as I would. I can affirm that most of the time this unenviable and ungrateful task is carried out by our Police with very great tact and efficiency. One must not forget that in the case of this crime it is extremely difficult to arrest the criminal. While there may be other crimes which are also committed in the dark, this crime is, in addition, kept as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>I think it is our duty in this Assembly here this afternoon to say that the Police do after all apply many safety measures when working with this Act, because they realize that they are not dealing with an ordinary abnormal deed of a person. They realize that the basis of this deed is a sexual drive which all people have. That is why they are extremely careful. Let me just furnish hon. members with a true example of these safety measures which are applied by our Police. Except in cases where people are caught red-handed, the arrests, where possible, are made under the supervision of an officer. I am saying &#x201C;where possible&#x201D;&#x2014;it is not always possible. But in most cases a policeman acts under the guidance of his officer. These officers are people who are fully equipped to deal with the various kinds of crimes. Here, arrests only take place when the officer is satisfied that it is time to act. I want to inform the hon. member for Houghton that often, when an immoral relationship develops between a White man and a non-White woman or a non-White man and a White woman, the Police warn these people that that immoral association must be terminated. Action is taken with great discretion. I also want to inform the hon. member that it is customary to delay arrest as far as possible until such time as the investigation has reached an advanced stage and there has been an opportunity of discussing the case with the Attorney-General or his representative. In other words, it is standing practice that the Department of Police and Justice officials should together decide when an arrest is to be made. I can inform the hon. member that the hon. the Minister of Police has assured me that this last precaution, if this should appear to be necessary, will in future be emphasized again, so that steps can be taken against these people in all justice and fairness. Hon. members will of course realize that these precautions are not always possible, because every investigation differs from every other investigation. It is not always possible to act precisely as prescribed in the regulations, the circular or whatever it is. But I want to inform the public that we will in point of fact have to think twice when we accuse the Police of having acted in such and such a manner. This does not apply to the entire Police Force. I am going to concede again that problems quite probably often arise with our Police. I do not think that we should generalize on the basis of the agitation which is set in motion in regard to the isolated cases which receive publicity in the Press, and speak and think in general terms when this only applies to a few isolated cases.</p>

<p>The other criticism one hears against this Act, is that it affords a person who has an intense dislike for another person an opportunity of getting that innocent person into trouble. The same applies to any other crime. When one has an enemy, it is not impossible to get him implicated in theft or something similar.</p>

<p>There is further protection in regard to this specific crime. Perhaps I could just bring it to the attention of hon. members. After the arrest, when a person appears before the court, we have, as far as sexual crimes are concerned and precisely because there is always the danger of malice, the cautionary rule in our law of evidence. The cautionary rule means that a presiding officer such as a judge or a magistrate, must actively concentrate on being overcautious when dealing with evidence in regard to a sex crime case. He must always bear in mind the possibility that the evidence may perhaps be coloured by personal feelings. This is a cautionary rule which has been laid down by our courts.</p>

<p>In addition we also have the corroborative rule. In terms thereof the various facts which all point to the guilt of a person, must be proved. I do not know whether the hon. member has actually read section 16. I have read section 16 very attentively. I have it here with me and if I must, I <span class="col_1803-1804" refersTo="page_0915"/>can quote it to hon. members. In reading this section I was struck by its fair wording. This Act has been drawn up from the point of view of the accused. It is not merely a summary dismissal of all possible defences. The hon. member quite correctly said that the definition of &#x201C;White&#x201D; in this legislation is rather flexible. But do hon. members know why this is the case&#x003F; It is in favour of the accused. That is the fairness of this Act. The definition of a &#x201C;White&#x201D; is stated so fairly that if a person is White in appearance, he or she is, as far as the Immorality Act is concerned, a White person. But it goes further. There is an &#x201C;or&#x201D; in this Act. For the purposes of this Act a person is a White if he is White in appearance, and if he is not White in appearance, but is accepted as a White and passes for a White, he is also regarded as being a White for the purposes of this Act. Now what does that mean in practice&#x003F; The position in regard to Blacks and Whites is quite clear. Judging from the appearance, one can immediately see whether there has been a crime. These people must be careful about that. But now one always finds these borderline cases. Let us take the case of a White man who has a relationship with a Coloured woman. If that person is White in appearance she is deemed to be White for the purposes of this Act. Then there can be no conviction. Or even if she should show signs of being a Coloured Woman, but has been associated with Whites and entered into a <i>bona fide</i> relationship with the White man, they are not guilty. But the Act goes even further. Subsection (3) of this Act introduces a defence, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be a sufficient defence &#x2026; that the person charged had reasonable cause to believe that the other person was a White person.</block>

<p>Oh please, I find it a terrible pity now that that hon. member suddenly wants to make a little political propaganda for his party. Perhaps he should wait for a United Party rally before doing so.</p>

<p>Whether it was a United Party amendment or not, this is an Act which was laid down by the National Party Government. And this Act reads that if a person has reasonable cause to believe that the other person is a White person, then that person is accepted as a White person. Can one, in actual fact, have a fairer Act than this one&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to sum up by saying that it is clear that we cannot abolish the Act. To do so would be in absolute conflict with the deeply-rooted principles of our people. As far as our police are concerned, we have taken precautions, and the same applies to our courts. As far as the Act itself is concerned, it has been drawn up as fairly as one is able to do. We on this side of the House want to state unequivocally that as far as we are concerned&#x2014;and all of us stand under the Act&#x2014;it is a principle among us that there must be no sexual relations across the colour line; this is not for the reasons given by the hon. member for Houghton, because her approach is entirely different, but because it is a South African more, a deeply-rooted more which cannot be changed. It is for that reason that we say that this Act will continue to exist, and we will ensure that it remains on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the speech of the hon. member for Prinshof was indeed remarkable, perhaps even more remarkable when one remembers that he is also a lawyer. He was not prepared to budge one inch about any one part of section 16 of the Immorality Act, not even in its implementation. When one considers what happened at Excelsior, one would have thought that the hon. member would have appealed to the hon. the Minister to do something about the implementation of the Act. He, as a lawyer, should have been horrified by what happened at Excelsior. I am amazed to hear from the hon. member that everyone who committed suicide after having been charged under the Immorality Act, did so because they knew that they had transgressed the Act.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The strength of the stigma is one thing. Those people committed suicide because of the strength of the stigma which attached to them whether <span class="col_1805-1806" refersTo="page_0916"/>or not they were guilty. Once one has in fact been charged, and this is a matter of public knowledge, the stigma is there and apparently it is sufficient to cause people to commit suicide, so strong is the feeling in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to say that the introduction of this motion by the hon. member for Houghton is, if I may say so, grand standing in the very highest tradition of this art of which the hon. member is somewhat of an expert. The operation of section 16 of the Immorality Act is the concern of every single man in this House and its implementation is often an affront to us all and to our country. But the motion comes at a singularly mistimed and politically unfortunate moment in its present form. At the beginning of this session, in the very first debate, the No-confidence Debate, this whole issue&#x2014;because of the Excelsior non-trial&#x2014;was brought before the House and was raised at the very first parliamentary opportunity by the very first speaker in that debate, namely the hon. Leader of the Opposition. After we had received from the hon. the Minister of Justice an explanation about what had happened at Excelsior, he then told us in a way to which we are now becoming used to, that so long as he is the Minister of Justice and as long as this Government is in power, section 16 of the Immorality Act will remain. Furthermore, this was repeated by the hon. the Prime Minister when he took part in that debate at a later stage. The attitude of the Government to this motion was known at that time. But the hon. member still felt that it was necessary thereafter to put this motion on the Order Paper. I want to say that by doing so she has deliberately made this a party political issue.</p>

She knows that that party has been committed by the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Justice, but she nevertheless comes with this motion, with the inevitable result that it is going to have to rest just there. The motion before the House means that the whole issue of the Immorality Act is going to remain just where it is. That is precisely what this motion does. The only conceivable affect of introducing the motion in this form is to freeze even more solidly the attitude which exists in this regard because it is a party political issue and because it has been made one by this motion. Surely the hon. member realizes that this motion will not be resolving this matter. Sir, we have tried to make this a non-party matter. [Laughter.] Sir, hon. members laugh.

<p>Sir, if the hon. the Minister had read my speech in the <i>Sunday Times</i> he would have been able to follow my speech a little more clearly than he is able to do at the moment. Sir, may I say that the Government is also responsible in this regard; they have also reacted in a party-political way, as they are doing with everything&#x2014;&#x201C;as long as we are the Government we are not going to move, no matter how wrong we are, no matter how long we have been wrong, no matter what the urgency, no matter what the protests are, we are going to stay just there&#x201D;. There will be no solution to this problem at all &#x2014;and this is an offensive problem&#x2014;unless we can take it out of the political <span class="col_1807-1808" refersTo="page_0917"/>arena. Sir, we have to try to open people&#x2019;s minds to it, not to close them as we are doing here. The matter is not so simple, as the motion suggests, that you can just scrap both these Acts forthwith. Has the hon. the mover of the motion ever considered, if this motion were accepted and acted upon immediately, all the other difficulties that would arise&#x003F; Where would people who enter into mixed marriages go and live, without an investigation into that matter as well&#x003F; What happens to the children as far as their classification is concerned&#x003F; The hon. member herself has already spoken of the degradation of being classified as a Coloured. I also wonder whether the hon. member has considered that there might well be some people who will feel that this is now a matter of licence&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member did not answer the basic question when she spoke about this: Is she or is she not in favour of miscegenation&#x003F; Is she against it or is she not against it&#x003F; She did not answer that question. She answered it with some sort of parable. But. Sir, I think that is a question to which we are entitled to have an answer when a motion of this sort is moved. Let us remember also that since even the last time this Act was dealt with, completely different social circumstances have arisen in the urban areas, circumstances which must be investigated before you can pass a motion such as this, Moreover, there is a great difference between repealing an Act and passing an Act. This party is on record, as is well known as being against the passing of both the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act in 1949 and the Immorality Act in 1950. We opposed them because we did not think it was necessary or desirable, and not because we were not against miscegenation. But now you have the situation where this has been the law all these years, since 1950. The Immorality Act was passed in 1950. The circumstances attending the Excelsior case have been the law since 1937. I sincerely ask the mover whether she really wanted some relief to the situation, which offends all of us, as I said, or whether she just wanted a grandstand opportunity to express the more obvious horrors of the operation of section 16 of the Immorality Act. Because we would like to take this out of the political arena and avoid the obvious anomalies, and let me say, even further hardships and dangers which could result from the adoption of this motion, I want to move as an amendment to the motion&#x2014;</p>

I have studied very closely the speech of the hon. the Minister of Justice when he replied in the No-confidence Debate, and nowhere there did he answer <span class="col_1809-1810" refersTo="page_0918"/>the question which was then asked by us as to whether he was prepared to appoint a commission of inquiry to examine the effect of this section and the operation of it, nor did I notice anything in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech. But it is a delicate issue, a sensitive issue in which are involved moral, religious, humanitarian, police, judicial and family problems; matters, as has been wisely said, not appropriate for legislation are often those matters which are not appropriate for political dissension either.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister knows as well as I do that this motion is not going to resolve the issue. He knows he is committed to his stand in this respect and that there is going to be a deadlock, but there is a need for a commission of inquiry. Surely the hon. the Minister would not deny that. Surely the evidence that is presented by leading members of just about all the churches in the Republic and of all denominations, of recently retired senior police officers and of all the newspapers, including Nationalist newspapers, including <i>Rapport</i> more recently and <i>Die Vaderland</i> very recently, and even <i>Die Transvaler,</i> and even by the academics&#x2014;and very recently, in fact on Saturday, 20th February, we had from the University of Stellenbosch a number of leading academicians who called for just what we are calling for. One found that their approach was that this matter must be taken out of the field of party politics, as had been done in the past, and that a commission of inquiry should be instituted to have a penetrating investigation outside the arena of party politics. That is what Dr. Vosloo, the Professor of Political Science at that university, said. The Professor of Anthropology had the same views. He also wanted a commission of inquiry. Surely the hon. the Minister cannot tell this House that these people are talking rubbish or that they do not know what they are talking about, or that what they say does not need some attention.</p>

<p>Sir, let us make no mistake about it. This is a problem which is deep-rooted in our society and in our history. The word &#x201C;miscegenation&#x201D; which appears in the amendment, is the reason for the legislation which is the subject of the motion. Miscegenation means the production of offspring by persons of different races. It does not mean sexual intercourse by itself or marriage by itself. The history of this country shows just how deep rooted this is. So far as the prohibition of mixed marriages is concerned, there was no legislation in the Cape because the Colonial Laws Validity Act of 1865 prevented this. In Natal there was no specific law in this regard, although it was there by implication. In the Transvaal and the Free State they provided only for valid marriages between White and White and between persons of colour and other persons of colour, although they did recognize marriages if they had been concluded outside the Transvaal. As far as immorality, that is, connection between Whites and non-Whites sexually, is concerned, there were laws in the Cape and the Orange Free State that a White woman could not have sexual contact with an aboriginal Native for gain, whereas in Natal and in the Transvaal, the offence was between a White woman and a Black or Coloured man, not the other way around.</p>

<p>What about the old Milner Law which prescribed 24 lashes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Then, in 1927, came the first Union legislation in this regard. The hon. member has referred to the old Milner Law, with 24 lashes. He must read the debates on the 1927 Immorality Act, which was the first Union legislation in this regard. That Act made it an offence for intercourse to take place between Black or White, that is to say between Natives and White persons, either way. If this in fact took place, the woman and the man were both considered to have committed an offence. The only real subject of discussion at that time was whether or not there should be 15 lashes. That was one of the arguments. Some hon. members felt that the Minister was wrong, and that he ought to impose 15 lashes, as was originally intended. There was no dissension whatsoever about that Act, except on that point. Another point was that at the time there was no Act prohibiting mixed marriages, and so the persons who took part in that debate complained that one could get away with committing an offence under this Act, by marrying the person who was also guilty of an offence. In 1936 we had the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Bill which was not proceeded with. Then came General Pienaar&#x2019;s Bill in 1937, which was not completed. That was to apply the law as the 1950 amendment did.</p>

<p>Then, in 1949 came the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. We opposed it because we did not think it was necessary, and there were all sorts of difficulties regarding <span class="col_1811-1812" refersTo="page_0919"/>the definitions of people and how the provisions of the measure would work. It was felt that it was not necessary. In the next year we had the follow-up of that measure, namely section 16 of the Immorality Act. This again was opposed by this side of the House on the basis that we did not think that that was also necessary. There was a debate on the Second Reading and very little happened in the Committee. On the Third Reading of that Bill there was no discussion whatsoever. The division between hon. members on that side of the House and on this side of the House did not concern the undesirability of mixed marriages. It concerned the effectiveness of prohibitory legislation. Surely, that is the position we are now in. We feel that miscegenation mixed marriages and intercourse across the Colour-line are undesirable, because it might produce miscegenation.</p>

<p>That is not the question. The question that may have to be decided is whether section 16 must be amended or repealed, or what should be done about it. The point is that this has been the law for 22 years. One cannot suddenly say, as the hon. member for Houghton has, that we must scrap the whole lot.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, I did not say that. That quotation is what was said by Colin Steyn when he, on behalf of the United Party, in 1950 opposed the Immorality Act on the Second Reading. If the hon. member quotes that, she is quoting it out of context, because I have never spoken on the matter without adhering to my party&#x2019;s attitude, which is the attitude I have just enunciated now. [Interjections.] You will get a chance to reply, Helen. Give me a chance to speak now. Mr. Speaker, I think it very important that this commission should consult with the non-European people of this country and hear their views. I ask myself whether the hon. member for Houghton has done so. It would do hon. members a lot of good if they read the report of the last commission which sat on this matter, namely the De Villiers Commission in 1939. This commission went into this whole question and called for the evidence of the various groups. I will read out what they said as far as the Natives were concerned. It said: &#x201C;The attitude of the Natives, specially the Bantu races, appears to be decidedly against mixed marriages.&#x201D; On page 21, concerning the Coloured&#x2019;s attitude, it said: &#x201C;They were unanimously opposed to marriage between European and Coloured for two reasons: such a marriage usually introduces dissension into family relationships, especially amongst the children of members of the same families; and the social reasons.&#x201D; On the same page the Indian community&#x2019;s attitude is stated: &#x201C;The South African Indian Congress, claiming to express the views of the Indian community, sent us a memorandum in which it was stated that the Indian community is opposed to mixed marriages as strongly as any other community in South Africa.&#x201D; I go further than that. Mr. Speaker. The commission of inquiry under the late Judge van den Heever, who sat on the Durban Riot Commission, found as a fact that the grievance of miscegenation was listed very high as one of the causes for the riots between the Indians and the Zulus. Judge van den Heever said: &#x201C;We have found this grievance to be one of the most powerful motives for anti-Indian feeling on the part of the Bantu.&#x201D; I wonder whether the hon. member consulted them, before she said that this should be repealed&#x003F;</p>

<p>I wonder if you are for or against this law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>It must be clear, even to the hon. member for Houghton, that we are as horrified as she is by some of the results of the implementation of section 16, and we have said so. But one does not suddenly, because one doesn&#x2019;t like something, chuck everything down the drain. What is the evidence about the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act at this stage&#x003F; I have no evidence of certain great hard hips, but I can tell hon. members, oddly enough, that I found it in the circumstances of the labyrinth of the laws by which we have to live&#x2014;and by that I am not necessarily condoning it&#x2014;to be a great help to many people. I want to tell hon. members that I have to deal with a number of population registration cases. This is also a law which must be looked at in relation to this matter. Many couples are living together and they have children. The one is classified as a Coloured and the other as White by the Department of the Interior. When one has exhausted one&#x2019;s remedies <span class="col_1813-1814" refersTo="page_0920"/>with the Department of the Interior and when nothing else can be done, they refuse to classify the one White despite the circumstances. My advice to them in that case is that they should go to the magistrate, that they should disclose all the facts and that they should ask him to marry them under the terms of the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, because they are White persons in terms of that Act. I want to tell hon. members that not one of them has not been married under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. There is this anomaly, and this is another reason why an inquiry is needed not only into this legislation but also into all the related legislation. They are now married as White persons under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act, yet their children shall go to Coloured schools because the children go to the schools according to what your population register identity is. Under the Population Registration Act the issue of that marriage must be classified under the Population Registration Act as Coloured. They must go to school in terms of a different definition. This whole question must be investigated, and surely there are enough cases like these. That is in fact one of the things which the De Villiers Commission recommended. They recommended that the issue of persons who are married as White persons should be regarded as White persons.</p>

<p>Let me deal very briefly with another matter. This matter came out very pertinently when the Excelsior trial was discussed, what did the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply disclose&#x003F; It disclosed that on the allegation of one Bantu woman who said, as the hon. the Minister has stated, when she came before the police: &#x201C;Yes, I have slept with So-and-So, but I am not the only one; So-and-So and So-and-So slept with So-and-So and So-and-So&#x201D;. On the strength of that at least 21 people were charged under the Immorality Act. This was disclosed in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, an investigation followed, but on the strength of that one allegation these arrests were made. It is even worse than the usual case, because it is clear from his statement that some of it was on hearsay from one person who herself was an accomplice. Then we come to the reluctant witnesses. The hon. the Minister, although it is not at issue in this debate, is quite wrong in saying that the witnesses could not be called under section 212 because they were accomplices. Under section 254 an accomplice can be compelled to give evidence. The evidence is in Hansard and it was given by the hon. the Prime Minister when we discussed these two clauses. It was given in this House in the Committee Stage. Actually we discussed the two clauses, clauses 17 and 19, together in this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Well, the other chap was convicted on it. An accomplice&#x2019;s evidence is usually very good when they know that they are going to get away with it, and in this case they were charged with murder. What I want to say is that the real problem was that the Minister wanted them all to plead guilty so that he would not be in the position of having to call some Bantu women to give evidence against White people, because they as accomplices would get an indemnity if they did give evidence. He would then have had the position that the society in which the trial was to take place would not have stood for it. The result was that this did not happen. That is the real difficulty. This is one of the things that makes this a different crime from any other crime. When the hon. the Minister says that this is just the same as any other crime, he is wrong. Surely this alone is worth investigating, that a prosecutor can be in this dilemma. If this was a murder trial, I suggest that there would have been ho dilemma; but it was not. It was a trial under section 16, with all the social ramifications and complications. That is why it could not be done. That is why it is different. <span class="col_1815-1816" refersTo="page_0921"/>That is why you must have an inquiry into this matter. It is not as simple as &#x201C;just&#x201D; the Immorality Act and &#x201C;just&#x201D; the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. It affects the whole social structure and the whole labyrinth of legislation which this Government has introduced. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>I have no intention whatsoever in this debate of trying to agree with the hon. member for Houghton, and even less with the hon. member for Durban North, who has just finished speaking. The difference is in any case that the hon. member for Houghton at least has the courage of her convictions to say where she stands and say that she is opposed to the law and wants it abolished. That is the last thing the hon. member for Durban North can say. A more complicated egg dance and a greater display of lack of courage has probably never been seen in this Parliament. If the hon. member now thinks that we can discuss this matter solely on a scientific basis, he is making a big mistake. If the hon. member now expects us to discuss this matter in this House with the calmness one finds in a classroom, he is also making a very big mistake. As far as I am concerned, this matter also has a political colouring. It also deals with the policy which the National Party advocates. This matter can be approached from that point of view. It was really pitiable to hear today what a lament the hon. member set up because the hon. member for Houghton had jumped the gun on him in getting this matter discussed in the House. What did the hon. member do&#x003F; Before Parliament had even begun, the hon. member got every single English-language newspaper extremely het up with reports which were nothing but political reports aimed at the National Party. It was intended for nothing else but to be used in the no-confidence debate. What is more, the hon. member went on with it after the no-confidence debate. Now the hon. member adopts a pious attitude here and says he wants to refrain from turning the matter into a political issue. But what did the hon. member do&#x003F; After the no-confidence debate the hon. member still carried on with his politicking. I shall deal in a moment with a report which appeared in the 14th February edition of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> What was that if it was not making a political issue out of the matter&#x003F; Now the hon. member wants to blame the hon. member for Houghton for wanting to turn it into a political issue, but what did he do&#x003F; He was trying to do so all the time. Why did he not in that report, if his intentions were so honest, in which he granted a personal interview to Mr. Stanley Uys, say &#x201C;My representation to the Government is: Remove the matter from the political arena&#x201D;&#x003F; Surely he had every opportunity to do that. The hon. member must not think therefore that we are going to buy those stories of his.</p>

<p>But the hon. member must now tell us something, right at the outset. He said that this Act has been on the Statute Book for 21 years now, and that it cannot simply be scrapped. The hon. member became extremely het up when the hon. member for Houghton said to him, &#x201C;Here is a report in which you said, This law should be scrapped&#x2019;.&#x201D; The hon. member also said here that he represented his party&#x2019;s standpoint. Now I am asking the hon. member to tell this House what his personal standpoint is; the hon. member for Bezuidenhout does that at least. He will at least say that his personal standpoint is that this Act should be scrapped. Why does he not have the courage of his convictions&#x003F; Why did he stand here for half an hour talking in circles&#x003F; The hon. member has by now become a professional talker in circles, to such an extent that the hon. the Minister of Information subsequently had to say to him, &#x201C;But tell us something to which we can listen now&#x201D;. Why does the hon. member not state whether or not he supports the hon. member for Bezuidenhout in his representations in respect of this petty apartheid, or the crudest of all crude apartheid, namely that it should be scrapped&#x003F; But you see, Sir, the United Party has over the years been too lacking in courage to adopt a standpoint in regard to this matter, and to state candidly &#x201C;This is what we advocate,&#x201D; or &#x201C;We do not advocate this&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. LE GRANGE</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not nonsense. The United Party did not vote on this legislation in 1927. They did not vote on it in 1949, nor in 1957. I shall bring hon. members proof of that. After <span class="col_1817-1818" refersTo="page_0922"/>all, in 1957 they knew very well what the purpose of the Act was. Hon. members knew very well what the purpose of the Act was, and they also knew what the purpose of the expansion of the Act was, namely that it was a consolidation. They also knew that the sentence was being increased from five to seven years, and accepted the Second Reading without any division. Where does the nonsense come in now&#x003F; Let us consider section 16 of this Act more specifically. In the Committee Stage section 16 of this Act was approved without a single opposing United Party vote. Hon. members can go and have a look in the Hansard report. Five persons voted against section 16 in the Committee Stage. They were Messrs. Hepple, Lovell, Standford, Whitely and Mrs. Ballinger. Where is the United Party vote against it&#x003F; Hon. members on the opposite side talk about adopting a standpoint, but what standpoint did they adopt at the time&#x003F; Let us consider the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. This matter was dealt with by Gen. Smuts himself. Gen. Smuts moved an amendment in which he said that mixed marriages were disapproved of by his side of the House, but that they did not want any legislation on it. Where was the division on that&#x003F; It is because of this lax attitude which the United Party have adopted all these years that they are still sitting on the Opposition side. Now the United Party wants to perform this same kind of egg dance here today and expect the public outside to think that the United Party is asking for a commission because this Act is so un-Christian and is being so terribly badly applied by the Police.</p>

<p>No, I am sorry; I only have twelve minutes at my disposal and I do not have the time to reply to the hon. member. The hon. member on the opposite side who talked about the Excelsior case must simply take the trouble to read the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s speech in reply to the speech made by the hon. member for Durban North in the no-confidence debate. He will find the answer he is looking for. In what respect do hon. members on the opposite side differ with the hon. the Minister&#x003F; In what respect do hon. members on the opposite side differ with the facts mentioned there, and do they say that the steps taken by the State were not proper and correct under the given set of facts&#x003F; Hon. members on the opposite side must now have the courage of their convictions, and must tell us this.</p>

<p>Let us go further and consider for a moment the egg dance performed by the United Party during the no-confidence motion. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout handed over his views on petty apartheid to the hon. the Prime Minister, and his hon. Leader then replied to that. We then had the same standpoint as has now been adopted. I realize that it was not possible to advocate the abolition of the Immorality Act during the no-confidence debate, because I know that the rules of the House prohibit that. However, we had the same attitude there. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that he was opposed to miscegenation and did not advocate mixed marriages, but it remained at that. Nothing was said then about what should happen then.</p>

<p>The National Party will not allow itself to be taken in tow by everyone who says that a commission should be appointed. We are not prepared to appoint a commission the moment somebody asks for one. The same thing happened after a recent diamond case. It is all very well to advance pleas of this kind when a debate of this kind takes place here. But have hon. members on the opposite side ever thought what result an abolition of this Act would have within our metropolitan areas, and, <i>inter alia,</i> on our Coloured population&#x003F; Has it ever occurred to hon. members on that side of the House that there must be protection against unscrupulous people&#x003F; Have hon. members on that side of the House ever looked at what the figures which, according to a report I read, revealed in Cologne in Germany&#x003F; It was found that 95 per cent of all mixed marriages were heading for failure. Have any of these people&#x2014; and I do not necessarily want to classify the hon. members of the Opposition among them&#x2014;who bewailed the fate of the offenders&#x2019; closest relatives, ever thought of the other parties in such cases&#x003F; Have they ever thought of the thousands of bastard children which result from these situations&#x003F; They speak so easily of suicide in regard to these cases. In how many cases of suicide does that suicide not take place because of the guilt feelings that person had about the adultery he committed, and not about the fact that he had been charged under the Immorality Act&#x003F; In how many cases does suicide not take place after a person has been arrested&#x003F; I can inform hon. members that I am convinced that more suicide cases occur under other crimes than under immorality. Here I am thinking in particular of a crime such as fraud. But if even the gallows does not serve to deter people from committing murder, why allege now that if this Act is abolished, the number of suicides would decrease&#x003F; I simply cannot understand that. It has too much to do with guilt feelings.</p>

Now they can discuss a real racial issue with all the emotions and heat that attaches to it.

Our attitude was clear 21 years ago when this Bill was before Parliament. At the time Dr. Colin Steyn stated most emphatically that this was not a matter for legislation. No matter how much every one of us disapproved of miscegenation, how strongly we revolted against the thought of miscegenation, it was not yet a matter for legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>We remember how we warned about the misery, the unhappiness and the social disturbances that would result from the application and the administration of this Act. What has happened now&#x003F; The hon. member for Houghton has moved a motion tonight because in her speech she could show with quite remarkable evidence that the United Party was right 21 years ago. Every event since then has shown that this is not a matter for legislation.</p>

<p>Sir, where I think the hon. member&#x2019;s action has been ill-considered is in the wording of her motion. She wants this Act to be repealed &#x201C;forthwith&#x201D; as if nothing has happened in the last 21 years. But, Sir, the whole social situation, the whole social structure of South Africa, has changed in the last 21 years. As a result of many laws there are now new consequences that we have to consider if we should repeal this measure without examining scientifically, carefully and calmly what these new consequences will be in the atmosphere of an expert commission appointed by the Government. The hon. member for Houghton made a strong point of all the experts of all political complexions who are supporting criticisms of these Acts, but she made the point herself&#x2014;knowing her as I do she did not disguise the point&#x2014;that many of them (I think she said about half of them) support an urgent inquiry into the application and administration of this Act. Those, Sir, are experts who know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>I believe that for us to rush into this &#x201C;forthwith&#x201D; would be extremely stupid and dangerous, and I believe that for us, again for political motives, to harden our hearts, as the Government is doing, and to refuse to admit that they have landed in a mess as a result of the fact that this Act appears on the Statute Book, is equally stupid and equally short-sighted. Sir, we were right. We see that this law requires harsh administration; we see that it is more difficult to obtain convictions under this law than under any other criminal law in our Criminal Code. We see that the number of acquittals, the number of people who are legally innocent, who have to suffer the degradation, the humiliation and the hurt of prosecution under this Act, are more than half of those brought before the court. Last year there was 55 per cent acquittals in prosecutions under this Act. Either the administration of justice under this Minister and under this Government is breaking down or this law is not capable of being administered in the same way as other criminal laws where the number of acquittals is far lower&#x2014;I think something like 25 per cent or 30 per cent. These are facts that we cannot argue against; they are there. If the hon. member for Potchefstroom wants clarity, all he need do is to look at the facts; all he need do is to open his mind a little bit&#x2014;just a little bit &#x2014;and he will see that we are right.</p>

<p>We find, Sir, that this law has cruel effects: that a larger number of suicides are committed as a result of arrest under this law than under any other criminal law. Sir, you very seldom hear of a man arrested on a charge of murder, committing suicide. In the old days when adultery was a crime in South Africa you very seldom heard of a man committing suicide because he had committed adultery. The hon. member for Potchefstroom puts these two things on the same level, but he has no evidence, no support, for his argument. No, Sir, let us face the facts. We are opposed to miscegenation not because of any reason of racial hatred but for the practical reason that miscegenation has consequences socially, and for the individual concerned, that are unfortunate. Sir, in 1949 and 1950 when these two Acts were put on the Statute Book we had to deal with the evil of miscegenation but now, Sir, a new situation has arisen. We are dealing with two evils. We are now dealing with the evil of miscegenation, which has not ended; and we are dealing with the evil which flows from <span class="col_1823-1824" refersTo="page_0925"/>the administration of this unfortunate Act. There are now two evils. There is a new situation, and if we now rush in and try to repeal the second evil, which is the law, then we create a new set of circumstances that can lead to new evils and new problems, as I will show. We have to find a way out of the impossible situation that the Government has created by introducing an Act like this and putting it on the Statute Book and trying, not very successfully, to administer and to apply it. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Sir, here I have an article in the excellent magazine <i>Personality</i> of 19 February, where various people were interviewed, and here we have Prof. S. A. S. Strauss, professor of law at the University of South Africa, not a liberal university, making no fewer than five suggestions as to what could be done to try to get out of the difficulties and the evil situation in which we find ourselves today as a result of the application of this Act. They should be investigated, and there are many other things. I cannot put the attitude of the United Party better than this independent jurist, Prof. Strauss, put it in this article, when he issued a warning. I too want to warn the House; I want to warn the hon. member for Houghton and I want to warn the Government because their attitudes, although they are poles apart, are essentially similar. They see no problems; they see no difficulties; they see simple solutions for one of the most complex problems that we have to deal with in South Africa. Here are Prof. Strauss&#x2019;s words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are dealing with a most delicate human problem. It is a problem that cannot be solved by political maxims. It is a problem that cannot be divorced from the entire social and political structure of the country. Let us not under-estimate the deep social and emotional ramifications of this issue.</block>

<p>It is because this party, which has always taken a responsible line in South Africa, does not wish to under-estimate the social and emotional ramifications of this issue that we call upon the Government to agree &#x2014;and I invite the hon. member for Houghton to accept our suggestion&#x2014;that this matter should be referred to a commission for proper investigation. That, Sir, will take the matter out of politics. If the hon. member for Houghton is sincere, as I know she is, then I say to her that she cannot escape her duty to accept the United Party&#x2019;s amendment so that the matter can truly be taken out of the political arena and discussed and thrashed out in an atmosphere where nobody is speaking for the Press, where nobody gives advance copies of their speeches to the Press, where nobody looks for political benefit and where we try to further the true interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a very reasonable question; I shall deal with it within a moment. Sir, we should ask this commission to investigate the new consequences that will arise from a repeal of this Act, because of what has happened in the last 21 years in South Africa. We will ask the commission to investigate what the effect would be of the new system of laws, of the new social structure that the Nationalist Party has created, upon people who avail themselves of their legal right to get married, for example. Of course, the hon. member for Houghton says that this must be done forthwith, under the present r&#x00E9;gime, with the present social system and structure that we have in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, that is much better than having a running commentary from that hon. member. That may be so, but let me tell her that marriage is not an <span class="col_1825-1826" refersTo="page_0926"/>ordinary contract. Marriage is an arrangement which confers a new status upon individuals and in which society has a real and great interest because it leads to the procreation of the species; it leads to the birth of children. The hon. member may be indifferent, but sensible people are concerned about the position in society of children who are born as a result of such an Act. Her approach is a light-hearted, shallow one, with no consideration of the consequences that will result from her Act. I say that this is the sort of thing that a commission must investigate.</p>

<p>Under the Group Areas Act, where will these people live&#x003F; Where will they be able to get entertainment together without humilation&#x003F; Where will they be able to relax together and swim together&#x003F; [Interjections.] These are things that have changed since 1950. We have a new situation. We have today, whether we like it or not, in South Africa population groups of different economic levels of development and it is a sociological fact that the males of the more developed group tend to abuse the females of the less developed group, so much so that even in many states of the U.S.A. until a few years ago that was reflected in the law. In a province of South Africa until 1927 there was a law making it a crime for a Black man to be intimate with a White woman, but it was not a crime for a White man to be intimate with a Black woman. That is the danger, and I say that if this law is repealed&#x2014;and that is what I would like the commission to investigate&#x2014;what protection can we give the women of the weaker society, not in the derogatory sense but in the economic sense&#x003F; What protection can we give them&#x003F;</p>

<p>Already there are Coloured people who are complaining about the new situation that has arisen because Black women may not come to an area like the Western Cape, so that their own women are in danger. That is the result and it is understandable. These are the problems that we would like the commission to investigate, amongst other things. That is why we on this side of the House say that because of this new situation, and a most unfortunate situation which has arisen, this should be investigated by experts. I do not believe in rhetorical questions, so I am not asking a question; I just want to put my difficulty to see that anything else can be the answer. Can there be an hon. member opposite, starting with the Minister of Justice, who can in his heart be satisfied or contented with the situation as it was revealed in the Excelsior case&#x003F; Surely there is something wrong when that can happen. Surely there is something wrong if as a result of gossip men can be arrested and humiliated, women can be arrested, a man who was innocent, as was afterwards proved, is arrested, suicides are committed, and in the end there is no prosecution. They are legally innocent, as far as the law is concerned. Surely one cannot be happy with that&#x003F; That is why again I say there is something wrong with this whole set-up, and it is worse than it was in 1949 and 1950 because the evil continues but a new evil has been superimposed upon it.</p>

<p>I want to mention another point to show you how we feel about this matter. Another matter which I would like to see investigated by this commission is how the powerful social sanctions can be made more effective. Nobody has disputed that there is a tremendous social sanction against miscegenation and sex.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. lady has now asked that stupid question ten times and the answer remains simple. The answer remains that we are in favour of an expert commission of jurists, sociologists, police, psychologists, religious leaders and moral leaders to investigate the rotten situation which has been created by the stupid actions of this Government over the last 21 years. What could be clearer&#x003F; In reply to my hon. friend, I want to say that we should, for example, investigate whether greater rights ought not to be conferred upon women, especially women of the weaker economic groups who are deflowered or made with child by irresponsible men, so that they can have justice <span class="col_1827-1828" refersTo="page_0927"/>done to them in public courts. That would be a tremendous sanction operating against the males who abuse their superior position in our world. There a great many other possibilities, but all I want to say is that I think, in the interest of South Africa, we should not play politics with this matter. Therefore I plead with the hon. Minister to accept the United Party amendment. It is a good and wise amendment. I also plead that the appeal of the hon. member for Houghton, which appeared in yesterday&#x2019;s paper, be realized. Let us take this matter out of politics, as she wishes and let us refer it to a commission of true experts outside the political sphere to give South Africa advice on one of its most delicate problems.</p>

<p>We have since 1927, and subsequently in 1948, 1950 and 1957, adopted a definite standpoint in regard to this Act. In not one of those debates did the United Party ever adopt a definite standpoint. Nor did they do so today. The fact of the matter is that they hide behind commissions of inquiries, as they put it, but there is no definite standpoint. Among all those hon. members, is there not one single suggestion as to how the Act can be improved&#x003F; They do not have a single suggestion, except that a commission should be appointed.</p>

<p>Yes, I shall come to that. In spite of all the criticism of this measure, and in spite of this psychosis which has been caused by the newspapers, there has so far been only one man who came forward with a proposal, i.e. the man mentioned by the hon. member for Yeoville, Prof. Strauss. I shall refer to him. He is the only man who made a suggestion; all the others want an inquiry to be instituted by a commission. In regard to this matter, the opinions of a number of people in Stellenbosch also appeared in the newspaper, as if this now represented the spirit prevailing in Stellenbosch, the heart-land of Afrikanerdom. That is how it was presented. The first person mentioned, is a kindred spirit of the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>Yes, Slabbert is a kindred spirit of the hon. member.

As far as the hon. member for Houghton is concerned. I want to congratulate her. Our standpoints differ from each other as east from west. However, she is at least honest: she states her standpoint; she is not ashamed to state it. But I now want to tell her this. She is always doing this kind of thing. She is always trying to take up the cudgels for people who contravene the colour line, people who have sexual relations or who marry across the colour line, but she knows that it will not be she. It must be we Afrikaners or the English-speaking people.</p>

<p>It will not be she as a Jewess who does something like that. <span class="col_1829-1830" refersTo="page_0928"/>She will in this respect keep herself clean. But among our Afrikaners and the English-speaking people it must be allowed, and we must be spurred on to do these things. That is the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude. That is in point of fact all I have against her. For the rest I have the greatest respect for her honesty in this connection. In this respect we are, as the hon. member for Prinshof said, bound to a certain norm in this country. The general norm in this country&#x2014;and on this score the United Party and the English-speaking people agree with us&#x2014;is that there should be no miscegenation, and that there should be no sexual intercourse across the colour line.</p>

<p>Who appointed the commission in 1938, or in 1939, to go into this matter&#x003F; It was the United Party. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Yeoville, who has just interrupted me, must allow me to finish speaking. I did not annoy the hon. member when he was speaking. The United Party instituted the investigation, but the United Party did not give effect to the recommendations of the commission, despite its tremendous majority in this Home. After all, a war was brewing. Up to 1949 nothing had happened; then the National Party gave effect to it. If the hon. member now claims that this Act is intended to counteract immorality, she is wrong. That is not justified; that was not the case.</p>

<p>The hon. member alleged that. The hon. member wanted to know: &#x201C;Why was adultery and the rest of it not punished&#x003F;&#x201D; When the Minister of the Interior introduced it, he stated very specifically that the purpose of the Bill was to check possible miscegenation as far as possible, and to promote racial purity as far as possible, even though the hon. the Minister also acknowledged that it would not be completely successful. That is the object of this Bill, and not to promote morality.</p>

<p>Various hon. speakers referred to the history of the 1927 legislation. Through that Act immorality, or sexual intercourse between White and Black, was prohibited. That measure was not opposed by the United Party. In 1949 there was the Mixed Marriages Act. In regard to that legislation as well there was no division, as the hon. member for Potchefstroom correctly said. That Party was afraid to vote against it, just as they are afraid for the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s motion. The hon. members who discussed it at the time, was Dr. Colin Steyn and Gen. Smuts.

<p>Yes, I shall come to the position as it is today. What is the actual charge today&#x003F; The charge which is being made, is that this Act has failed completely. The first charge is that there is such a small percentage of successful prosecutions and convictions. The figure is approximately 50 per cent, or a little more than 50 per cent successful charges. What are the actual facts in regard to the matter&#x003F; Now we must bear in mind what type of crime we are dealing with here. When one makes comparisons one must compare it to crimes of a similar nature. One must compare it to the same type of crime in order to determine what the percentage of convictions is. We are dealing here with crimes where you have to have recourse principally to accessories. When people <span class="col_1831-1832" refersTo="page_0929"/>commit immoral acts, they do not call a lot of people together to witness what is going on, so that you can then take them to court.</p>

<p>No, not a gossipmonger, but to the evidence of the accessory. That is what happens. A similar crime is the receipt of stolen goods. There one also has to have recourse to an accessory. In the case of stolen goods, where one has to have recourse to accessories, the number of successful prosecutions is much less than in the case of this Act. It is much less. One must therefore compare similar cases in order to be able to make a true comparison. That is the one charge.</p>

<p>The second charge is the &#x201C;fiasco of Excelsior&#x201D;, as it is called. In the Excelsior case, things went wrong, and I explained it in this House.

<p>I shall quote Prof. Strauss&#x2019; opinion to the hon. member. The article appears under the heading &#x201C;Has the Act as a deterrent proved worthwhile&#x003F;&#x201D; I think that is the point the hon. member wants to know. Prof. Strauss says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1833-1834" refersTo="page_0930"/>Critics of section 16 quote the large number of convictions as evidence of how ineffective this law is. Undoubtedly the deterrent effect of this law is relatively weak. But the same could be said of the prohibition against rape, immorality, against juveniles and even murder. No penal sanction is an absolute deterrent but this does not suggest that we should simply scrap our criminal law.</block>

<p>That is the reply. The same applies to murder. I am continually being attacked because of the large number of capital cases and executions. There are up to 100 each year. Must we now abolish the sanction against murder because it does not deter people from committing murder&#x003F; In this connection I should also like to refer further to the article by Prof. Strauss. Honestly, I have kept my eyes open and I take a great deal of interest in it, for this is a matter which one does not of course, from the nature of the case, casually overlook. One is not unsympathetic towards it. What I find to read about the subject, I read. That is why I read Prof. Strauss&#x2019; article very carefully. I want to say that a more objective article I have never seen. It covers <i>inter alia,</i> the argument that, because sex is involved, which is of course an urge in people, one must deal with it in a different way to other crimes. I have said in this House that it is a crime just as any other, and is punished in the same way. He says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is fallacious to argue that human sexual behaviour falls outside the ambit of the law. Man cannot simply be regarded as a biological creature when it comes to sex. He also possesses a spiritual&#x2014;moral personality. In his sexual life he is subject to norms. If it is the prevailing view of society, or of the majority of the electorate for that matter, that all sexual behaviour across the colour bar is reprehensible, the sentiments of society could conceivably be protected by criminal law.</block>

<p>He suggests that it ought to be done by criminal law. That is what is happening here. Then he makes further suggestions. He is of course opposed to the Act. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Summing up, even if it is conceded that there was a case to be made out for the retention of this provision on the Statute Book, the question should be asked whether the time has not arrived for certain urgent statutory amendments affecting the practical application of the Act.</block>

<p>This is not what I did not get from the Opposition. I did not get one single suggestion from them, even though there are such a great number of them in this House, except that the hon. member for Durban North made a suggestion in his amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is not a proposal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall leave him at that.</p>

<p>The first proposal made by Prof. Strauss is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provision for a statutory warning to be given by a magistrate to the parties before any actual prosecution is instituted. This procedure should be <i>in camera</i> and the parties should be confronted with the material facts which the Police allege against them. &#x201C;A prosecution should follow only where the parties subsequently persist in their behaviour.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, I do not think there is one person in this House who is prepared to accept this proposal. It means that two persons must be allowed to have relations across the colour bar at least once. Then they must be summoned before the magistrate and must there <i>in camera</i>&#x2014;their names must not be made known&#x2014;be told: &#x201C;Look here, you are doing something wrong; if it happens again, we will deal with you.&#x201D; I reject this with the contempt it deserves. I think the hon. member for Transkei will agree with me.</p>

<p>The second suggestion he makes reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1835-1836" refersTo="page_0931"/>Any conviction should fall away automatically where the other party is acquitted. The present policy is for the Minister to release the convicted party in such a case, but this is not sufficient because the conviction still stands against the name of the person concerned.</block>

<p>This is the case. It happens quite often in fact that if the non-White woman is found guilty, the White man gets an attorney, is defended, and is found not guilty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Surely both must be guilty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. That is why, administratively, it is done in such a way that she is immediately released after she reaches prison. But the fact still remains that the conviction still stands against her name. This is therefore an idea which one could consider. There is quite a lot to be said for this suggestion.</p>

<p>His third suggestion reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Consideration should be given to the possibility of trials being held <i>in camera,</i> but since there are many objections to such a procedure, the alternative would be to prohibit the Press from disclosing the identity of the accused.</block>

<p>The hon. member expressed her disapproval of this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>But this is an idea which is quite popular, i.e. that the people should be dealt with differently. Their names must not be disclosed, at least not until they are found guilty. I also received representations in this connection which I referred to Appeal Judge Botha, the commissioner who is at present sitting in regard to our criminal procedure. This is for him to consider as a suggestion. I will almost be amazed if he accepts it, but he will at least consider it. It is a suggestion. My own feelings about this are, why should one not do this with every crime if you do it with this one&#x003F; One cannot distinguish between this offence and any other offence.</p>

<p>His last suggestion is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A prosecution should be instituted only upon instructions of the Attorney-General and it should not be left to the public prosecutors to take the decision. There are several precedents &#x2026; for this in the South African Statutory Law.</block>

<p>That is true; there are quite a number. I looked up a few of them. Section 10 of the Official Secrets Act provides that prosecutions can be instituted after the Attorney-General has considered the case. Section 21 of the General Law Amendment Act, the sabotage clause, makes the same provision. Section 8 of the Terrorism Act makes the same provision, as well as section 3 of the Indecent of Obscene Photographic Matter Act. Administratively we have precisely the same provision in regard to certain liquor matters, as well as to the Sunday observance laws, namely that it must first be referred to the Attorney-General of the province concerned. Sir, I recently had the Attorneys-General of all the provinces, with the exception of one, in my office. I asked them a few questions in this regard. The first question I asked them was whether there was any reason to act differently in a section 16 case than in other cases. The general opinion was that there was no real reason to do so. One simply cannot justify it. That was their reply. I then asked them whether they were prepared to give instructions that this kind of prosecution would not be proceeded with before it had received their personal attention. They were unanimously prepared to give instructions in their various provinces that where persons are charged the dossier should first be referred to them before the case is taken further, so that they can give their personal approval before the prosecution is proceeded with. These instructions will go out after this debate has been concluded. In this respect I am able to accommodate the hon. member for Durban North. The last part of his amendment was already carried out on 16th February, 1971.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>That is why we released him immediately. He was not asked to plead and was released immediately. The difficulty in regard to this matter is the psychosis which is being built up in regard to the Immorality Act. As I have already said, the solution to that is very simple. Our White must simply stay away from the other colour groups and <i>vice versa.</i> I shall furnish hon. members with figures of what is actually happening. I have here the number of convictions for the four years ending 1969. The convictions of White men with Bantu women was 769.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Can those Bantu women get maintenance&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, if the Bantu women can prove that the White man was the father of her child, she can receive maintenance for that child. And there were no less than 394 cases where White men committed immoral acts with Coloured persons other than Bantu women. Altogether there were 1,163 convictions of White men. And the hon. member is always so concerned about underprivileged persons, and I am too. This Act partially offers protection to underprivileged persons because what really happens here&#x003F; We are busy prostituting the underprivileged non-Whites. That is in point of fact what is happening. The hon. member ought to plead for greater protection. She ought not to plead for the abolition of this Act. For that same period the number of convictions of Bantu men with White women was a mere 22, of Coloured men with White women, a mere 18, and of Asiatic men with White women, a mere 13. That shows <span class="col_1839-1840" refersTo="page_0933"/>hon. members what is happening. It is our task and our duty to apply this Act in the most humane way possible. That is why I had these discussions with the Attorneys-General. We want to make certain that there was a proper case, and that there was no possibility of a person being summoned before the Court who could, at best, be found not guilty. That was the idea behind these discussions. Those are then the steps we are taking. I want to emphasize again that the solution is quite simple. One must simply not find oneself in this difficulty. It is our South African way of life, both of the English-speaking as well as the Afrikaans-speaking people, that one must not have intercourse across the colour line.</p>

<speech by="#heunis">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I waited with real interest to see the actual standpoint which the various parties in this House would adopt in respect of the legislation and the motion. I think it is essential for us to strip this motion and its discussion of its non-essentials and to penetrate to the fundamental aspects. I do not think this House finds it difficult to understand and appreciate the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s standpoint. After all, it is consistent with her political view. It is known that the hon. member for Houghton advocates an integrated society and that any obstacle in the way of this process of total integration, is in fact rejected by this hon. member. It is correct that this hon. member wants to bring about a process of equalizing the existing differences. Thus she could not motivate her argument and her standpoint with the human considerations which others have against this legislation. To her the most important aspect is not the stigma attaching to the alleged offender or his family as a result of prosecution in terms of this Act. Although I cannot agree with the hon. member, I at least appreciate the clarity with which she puts her point of view.</p>

<p>When we come to the hon. members of the United Party, however, we find ourselves in a strange position. We have repeatedly had the situation that the United Party tries to be everything for everybody at all times, and consequently suffers from political impotence. Just look at what has happened. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout adopted a standpoint in respect of what he alleged was petty apartheid. In addition, he said that section 16 of this particular legislation was the crudest and pettiest form of petty apartheid. The hon. member for Yeoville then made a typical rescue attempt by saying that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was actually referring to the application of this Act. What happened then&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout came forward and gave a definition of petty apartheid. In short, his definition means that petty apartheid is the enforcement of apartheid measures without consultation with the groups affected.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. C. HEUNIS</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; taking into account his standpoint in that regard, should vote for the motion of the hon. member for Houghton. I think he is guilty. But what happened in addition&#x003F; The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is the great exponent of the adverse effects of apartheid legislation. He is the apologist of the compassionate society. This Act forms part of that legislation, but the hon. member does not deem it worth the trouble to take part in a debate in which this Act is under discussion. And he has to ask the hon. member for Yeoville to step into the breach for him. In this way he naturally succeeds in avoiding having to state his viewpoint. Because what is the hon. members&#x2019; answer to problems&#x003F; &#x201C;Appoint a commission&#x201D; is their answer. This commission must formulate the United Party&#x2019;s standpoint for them. It must save them. But I want to ask the United Party what recommendation they are going to submit to such a commission&#x003F; I think it is essential, in discussing the motion of the hon. member for Houghton, that we do not do so in isolation, but that we see it against the background of the existing complex composition of our population. In her idealistic aims, this hon. member can easily ignore the complexity of our society and the composition of our population. It is easy to do so.</p>

<p>But this legislation does not stand in isolation. It forms a pattern or a part of a pattern in which a whole society and its composition are reflected.</p>

<p>I am afraid the performance of hon. members on that side of the House actually means nothing more and must be regarded as nothing more than a method of deriving some sordid political advantage from certain circumstances and from certain standpoints, but especially from a complicated situation. I want to emphasize that this legislation represents part of a pattern which is aimed at the protection of communities, which is aimed at combating miscegenation, but especially at the orderly regulation of a society and a community.</p>

<p>Oh, that hon. member must simply keep Sea Point White by means of legislation or otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that the composition of the South African population precludes any easy solution. In addition, I want to say that outside South Africa there is no example of a country with a multi-national composition such as ours and which can profitably be held up to us. In principle the approach of which this legislation forms part is based on the fact that differences exist, that biological ethnic and cultural differences and differences in colour exist. Nobody who wants to make a contribution to sound relations in a complex society and who wants to help to solve these problems can ever ignore the existing circumstances. I find it difficult to imagine a more important factor in the destruction of human relations between White and Brown than in fact sexual intercourse over the colour line, and especially in respect of those who are born of such relationships.</p>

<p>I think one can only discuss this subject effectively if one asks this question and finds the answer to it: what is a criminal law system and what is envisaged by it&#x003F; A criminal law system is nothing but a protective measure of a community, a protective measure of groups within a community. If one asks this question in respect of this legislation, which the hon. member for Houghton wants abolished, one finds that here the pure object of a criminal law system is implemented, namely the protection of communities. But the reason for the existence of both the pieces of legislation concerned must in fact be found in the mighty, I almost want to say, except for a few exceptions, total disapproval, in the South African way of thinking, whether it be Afrikaans or English speaking, of miscegenation in the first place.</p>

<p>The conclusion arrived at by the commission which investigated the desirability of legislation in respect of mixed marriages is known. Their recommendations were implemented in this legislation by the Government. On the one hand, the critics of this legislation, including the United Party, base their standpoint against the existence of this legislation on the tremendous social sanctions against and the stigma attaching to transgressors of this Act. But this very process contains the motivation, the reason for this legislation, because if public opinion places such a tremendous sanction on the transgressor and such a stigma is attached to him, it reflects the attitude of the society. This attitude is given legal expression by this legislation. It is true that where such a degree of disapproval of a particular practice or malpractice exists in a community, it usually leads to legislation. In this case it is no different.</p>

<p>I have heard of the sympathetic attitude, and I do not condemn it, but share it, towards the transgressor. I have heard of the sympathetic attitude towards the family of the transgressor, but I have heard no word of sympathy for the child born out of such a relationship. I have heard no word of the prejudice of society which such a child must suffer for a lifetime. He does not live in the well-to-do home of the father, but in the poor circumstances of the mother. Ask any social worker, male or female, to describe the circumstances which are found here.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that this legislation represents a pattern. I say that at some stage or other the United Party will have to come to the conclusion that in order to have a share in governing, even as an Opposition, they will have to adopt a standpoint without asking for a commission to do so for them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to raise certain matters under paragraph (b). This provides that before the additional amount of interest payable on a bond is taken into consideration in determining rental, the lessor must prove the satisfaction of the Rent Board that the loan has been or will be applied for the purchase, erection or improvement (other than the maintenance and repair) of the premises. I raise this matter because, as the hon. the Minister may know, there is more than one way of killing a cat. An individual or a company wanting to build a block of flats may use his own capital for the purpose in order to avoid mortgage liability. Subsequently he may find himself in a position where he may want to use that asset as security to raise funds for other business or building purposes. As the clause now reads, however, he will be penalized if he pays an interest on his bond of more than 8&#x00BD; per cent in that he will not be able to recover the difference from the tenants of the block of flats. The other builder may well decide in order to build a block of flats that he will borrow the money from a private company, a company of which he will be the sole beneficial owner of the shares. If he uses that company to finance the building of the block of flats it will be the loan creditor. In that way the owner will be able to collect the additional 1 or 1&#x00BD; per cent, as the case may be, from the tenants of that particular block of flats. We are, of course, not opposed to this provision, but I think it will need careful watching by the department to ensure that subterfuges and manoeuvres do not take place. I am sure the hon. the Minister will agree with me that the person who initially puts in his own capital in order to build dwellings for letting ought not to be placed in a worse position than the man who uses the manoeuvre of borrowing from a company of which he is the sole owner. This may have an effect on the building of additional blocks of flats. One may find that the owner of block A who wants to mortgage that block in order to build another block is going to be the loser at both ends because the new block will not be mortgaged and consequently he will not be entitled to that extra percentage. His old block is cut out for recoupment of this extra percentage because of the provision of this particular clause. All I want to ask the Minister is to ensure that his department watches this particularly to see whether this provision is not outmanoeuvred to the detriment of the builder who sets to work in a straightforward manner for the construction of dwellings. This matter gives point to the remarks the hon. the Minister made during the Second Reading when he said that this type of approach was one which needed further investigation by the Government; and this is one of those many which probably justify further investigation in order to ensure the effectiveness of this legislation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>There is another aspect to this provision that we should consider. It became clear to me after I had carefully analysed this provision. A person may have a loan for a period of, say, 5 years. With that money he has bought premises and erected a block of flats on it. Now, however, he <span class="col_1847-1848" refersTo="page_0937"/>has to go to a different financial institution to renew that loan of his after five years. My question is whether the wording of this particular provision covers a case like this, a case of loan renewal. I think the hon. the Minister should give us clarity on the question of loan renewal and tell us whether this is also covered, because the loan is not specifically for purchasing or building, because this has already been done. The loan is only negotiated to obtain money to help the lessor over his problems and to make possible the recoupment of the interest from the lessees.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I agree that there are dangers implicit in any amendment of this nature, and they will naturally have to be looked at very carefully. On the other hand, the clause which is here being amended by the addition of (b) is an essential one inasmuch as there have been cases of blatant exploitation.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with (b),&#x2014;the question of loans. Where an owner takes a bond on a property that bond has to be subsidized by the tenant; interest is allowed in the allowable rent and yet the money which is raised by taking out a bond could be spent on other purposes. If it is spent on the building of additional flats, those flats are now not under rent control. Therefore the owner can charge whatever rental he likes for the new block of flats and he will cover, within what the market will carry, interest rates as well, so in fact he is getting free money at the cost of the tenants of an existing building on which he takes out a loan. Sir, I welcome this provision and I am sure that the hon. the Minister will realize the difficulties raised by my colleague the hon. member for Green Point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>What this will prevent is that a tenant in a controlled block of flats will be called upon to subsidize interest rates on a bond taken out on a controlled block while the money is spent to build an uncontrolled block. This provides protection to the tenant of a controlled block where the bond is registered against a controlled building but where the money has in fact not been spent on that building.</p>

<p>Then I would like to refer to paragraph (a), another improvement which I welcome and which will cover some cases of hardship which I have discussed with the Minister and which I do not need to go into here. I had wondered whether this clause might not have gone further, but I agree now that perhaps it goes far enough. I want simply to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the situation of a daughter who has nursed an ailing mother, for instance, or to quote another case which his department has had to deal with, the case of a sister who has nursed an invalid sister over a long period of years, in one case for 15 years. The one sister gave up her work to nurse an invalid and mentally affected sister of hers and looked after her for 15 years. The lease of the flat was in the name of the ill and mentally deficient sister. When that sister died, the one who had given her whole life to looking after her, was then given notice on the ground that she was not the tenant. I realize that you cannot cover every case by law.</p>

<p>Finally I welcome paragraph (c), the amendment of &#x201C;services&#x201D;, which will eliminate what is becoming nothing less than a racket, and that is the selling of so-called meal tickets entitling a person to a bun and a cup of coffee at an adjoining restaurant <span class="col_1849-1850" refersTo="page_0938"/>and then claiming that it is a bed-and-breakfast establishment. This has been exploited by certain owners of buildings and I think it is only right to say to others who may be adversely affected by this clause that they have to thank for it a few unscrupulous people who were prepared to try to twist the law in order to give what they call meals but which in fact were not meals. The result has been this amendment which will close that loophole, and if it causes inconvenience to genuine landlords they must blame those who made it necessary.</p>

I think it is quite clear what we actually want here, and if a man then borrows money from himself, really, to build a new block of flats and that type of thing, I think we can close that loophole. As far as the hon. member for Durban Point is concerned, I think we agree. The other difficulty he brought up is in fact a difficulty, but I do not know whether we can draft a clause which will deal with all possible hard cases that can crop up in that direction. I do not think it is possible.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>There is one point I want to raise. Increases which result from an application are invariably made effective from the date of application. I wonder why the Minister has used the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; in regard to a reduction instead of making it compulsory from that date of complaint. It seems to me that the wording here is not consistent with what is done in regard to the making effective of increases, namely from the date of application, whereas the reduction is only permissive as from the date of complaint.</p>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that the Rent Board need not necessarily in terms of this clause make the reduction effective from the date of complaint, but where it orders an increase it must make the increase effective as from the date of application. Why is there a difference in regard to a reduction resulting from a complaint as compared with an increase resulting from an application for an increase&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The point here is that as the law stands now, a decrease in rent is effective from the date when the letter is posted, or arrives at the home of the tenant, which is obviously unsatisfactory, so what we have done here is to say that the Rent Board must have the power to stipulate that it will be from a particular date. We did not deal with the question of an increase because that is quite clear in the law. The increase applies from the date when the application was made. There is a little difference between the two but it is so small that I do not think we need make any alteration here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#murray">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. G. MURRAY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that there is a difference. There are cases where an increase is ordered and a tenant, at great difficulty, is called upon to pay the additional amount for five or six months in one lump sum. Now if a tenant has been overcharged to the extent that the Rent Board finds that the rent was not reasonable, it seems that the relief provided for the tenant might well extend to the date of the complaint. I am not moving an amendment but I only want to ask the Minister to give consideration to substituting &#x201C;shall&#x201D; for &#x201C;may&#x201D; as far as reductions are concerned, to bring it into line with the procedure adopted in regard to increases.</p>

<p>Clause 4 (b) provides an additional protection for a tenant. I welcome <span class="col_1851-1852" refersTo="page_0939"/>this, since this flows directly from a plague of eviction notices given to parents to whom children were born in Durban. Again I would like to say to those who may find this inconvenient, that they have one firm of estate agents in Durban to thank for this provision, because this firm made a particular point of giving notice to tenants because they had had children. I do not know if I will be permitted to deal in detail with it, but the evil which is here being prevented is linked very closely with another loophole which is used for the same purpose, namely giving notice to people who do what is known as personal smalls washing in a flat where laundry is not allowed.</p>

<summary>(Committee Stage)</summary>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>A new clause 3, a new clause 4, a new clause 19, a new clause 20 and an amendment to the title appear on the Order Paper. All of these amendments deal exclusively with one matter, i.e. the question of keeping registers of unqualified assistants in pharmacology and of trainee chemists and druggists. Last week I received from the Pharmacy Board an urgent request for this amendment to be effected. They were unable to let us have it at an earlier date, nor did they draw our attention to it earlier on. It also deals with the fact that the training of chemists and druggists was changed two years ago in that a chemist and druggist is now required to have undergone four years&#x2019; academic training plus a year of training with a chemist and druggist. The term &#x201C;unqualified assistants&#x201D; indicates that the Pharmacy Board would like students who have already completed their first two years and have enrolled for their third and fourth years to work with registered chemists and druggists during their holidays.</p>

<p>I placed these amendments on the Order Paper in an attempt to have them incorporated into this Bill. But since this deals with clause 15, for which no provision has been made in the long title, it would be necessary to give an instruction to the whole House to discuss these amendments at the Committee Stage. I should have liked to have given such an instruction with the co-operation of both sides of the House. However, in negotiating this matter with the Whips, I did not readily obtain from the other side of the House permission to do this. For that reason I did not make the suggestion. As a result of that I am, therefore, not going to propose the new clause 3, clause 4&#x2014;as it appears on the Order Paper, for it deals exclusively with this matter&#x2014;the new clause 19, the new clause 20 or the amendment to the title. I am sorry that this is the case. I am particularly sorry because the Pharmacy Board felt very strongly about this matter. However, I do not wish to do something of that nature without the full co-operation of the Opposition, as this affects national health. Unfortunately I was unable to obtain the co-operation of the Opposition in this regard. That is the reason.</p>

<p>Clause 6:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_1853-1854" refersTo="page_0940"/>To add the following proviso after &#x201C;Minister&#x201D; in line 48:</p>

<block name="quote">Provided further that the provisions of paragraph (c) shall not be construed as prohibiting a dentist from&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) diagnosing cancer while performing in respect of any person any act pertaining to the practice of dentistry, or</li>

<li>(b) treating cancer so diagnosed.</li>

</ol>

<p>This clause deals with one matter only, i.e. the role played by dentists nowadays in diagnosing and treating cancer. Hon. members will be able to see that this clause seeks to restrict the cancer quacks altogether so that they will no longer be able to diagnose or give treatment. However, one must exclude certain persons from that action, as is in fact being done in clause 6, i.e. medical practitioners who normally do this type of work and others who are registered as such. In their representations to me the Dental Council and the Dental Association requested that dentists should also be included here in view of the fact that dentists did not deal with these matters in former years, but nowadays there are several cases of oral surgery and oral cancer which are not only diagnosed by dentists, but also treated by them. The whole object of this legislation is that such people should be excluded as well. For that reason I propose that it be inserted here that dentists shall not be prohibited from diagnosing or treating cancer. That is the object of this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. L. FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we on this side of the House naturally welcome the inclusion of dentists and as the hon. the Minister knows at the moment there is a specialized field in the dentistry which deals particularly with this condition of the mouth. While I am on my feet I want to deal with another matter under clause 6. I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the new paragraph (c) which reads, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">diagnoses, treats, or offers to treat or prescribes treatment or any cure for cancer; &#x2026;</block>

<p>I wonder if it would be possible for the hon. the Minister to add after the word &#x201C;cancer&#x201D; the words &#x201C;or any other growth&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister will know that one of the dangers of inexperienced people treating non-malignant growths, is that they might be quite easily turned into malignant growths by their plasters and so on. I wonder whether he could not give this some consideration. Furthermore, while I am on this question of cancer, there is another point which I want to deal with. Would the hon. the Minister tell us whether recognized institutions will include, for research purposes, those pharmaceutical companies which are doing research work in the production of pharmaceuticals of one kind or another which may help in the treatment of cancer. It is not clearly stated here. By institutions I think we mean hospitals or recognized research institutions like the South African Institute for Medical Research. I would like the hon. the Minister to make it clear in this Committee Stage that those pharmaceutical companies which are doing research work in cancer will be included in &#x201C;institutions&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Dental Association of South Africa will be particularly grateful for the addition of this proviso. It is in the interests of our medical profession that dentists should receive this recognition. From the nature of their practice it so happens that they are usually afforded the first opportunity of making a diagnosis of cancer in the oral cavity. In addition I want to mention that the two schools of dentistry in South Africa are paying special attention to cancer. The students are given a good grounding in attending to this disease in their private practices. Then I want to mention that at present the specialists, the oral surgeons, are receiving training enabling them to cope fully with the treatment of cancer. For that reason we are particularly grateful to the hon. the Minister for having decided to add this proviso.</p>

<p>&#x2020;In regard to the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2019;s last point which he raised, namely his reference to pharmaceutical institutions which are doing research work, I want to state that they are certainly included in this clause. As the clause reads, the hon. member will see it says: &#x201C;At any <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0941"/>institution approved for this purpose by the Minister&#x201D;. This was inserted on purpose, so that all these pharmaceutical institutions which are registered with us will get the approval of the hon. the Minister so that he will know, also for the sake of the Medical Research Council, where such research is being done in South Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to the second point, the inclusion of the words &#x201C;or any other growth&#x201D; after the word &#x201C;cancer&#x201D;, I can see the point of the hon. member. I may say that this was also raised with me by hon. members on this side of the House some time ago. I have given this matter my careful attention but have decided against it for the simple reason that, firstly, as this clause reads now, the provisions are very strict indeed, as the hon. member knows. Secondly, if any other growth is included the provisions of this clause will go too far. Then, for example, a chiropodist who treats feet as well as some growths on feet, will be affected. We have looked into the matter and I am sure that the clause as it stands now is going far enough in combating the evil that we would like to combat in South Africa. If we go as far as is suggested by the hon. member, perhaps with good reason, I feel that we will be going too far and we will include other people whom we would not like to be covered by the provisions of this clause.</p>

I would nevertheless like to ask him to give this aspect his very careful consideration, especially where advertisements appear in the paper which simply state that readers should phone a certain number to have growths removed. These advertisements do not specify cancer but simply say that growths will be removed. I think we must investigate these people to see exactly what they are doing. This is one of the reasons I raised the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I say very specifically that dentists are qualified and recognized as being able to make diagnoses in connection with their particular work, namely as far as the mouth is concerned.

<p>Clause 7:</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment standing in my name in the Order Paper, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>To add at the end of the Clause:</p>

<block name="quote">39D. (1) The provisions of sections 32 and 39A shall not apply in respect of any person who is practising for gain as a chiropractor in the Republic.</block>

<block name="quote">(2) The provisions of section 39C shall not be construed so as to prohibit any person referred to in subsection (1) from performing for gain any act which is at the date of commencement of this Act usually performed by chiropractors.</block>

<block name="quote">(3) When any person is charged with a contravention of section 39C of this Act, the onus of proving that any act was at the date of commencement of this Act usually performed by chiropractors, shall be on the person alleging it.</block>

<p>The object of my amendment is to provide that the provisions of this clause of the Bill and other clauses relating to the prohibition of certain persons to do certain acts and that the sanctions that will apply <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0942"/>to them if they do these acts shall not apply to chiropractors. As we indicated during the Second Reading debate, if one looks at the clauses which precede clause 7, it is clear, and I put it no higher than this, that chiropractors could be subjected to the provisions of the new section 39C added by clause 7 of the Bill. This new section 39C provides that certain criminal offences will be committed by persons who do certain acts which are not authorized. As I say, I put it no higher than that they could be in fact dealt with under this new section. The hon. the Minister has said that he does not want chiropractors to be dealt with under this measure and that it was not his intention to do so. But as evidence of the fact that they could be dealt with under this particular clause and especially under the proposed section 39C one had the Bill which was withdrawn by the hon. the Minister and, in fact, the new Bill in which it appears that when a person is charged with contravening the new section 39C the onus of proving that he was in fact a chiropractor shall be on him and that the provisions will not apply to a chiropractor. This indicates that in fact this clause could encompass the activities of chiropractors. If I understood the hon. the Minister in the Second Reading debate, he said that in principle he had no objection to chiropractors being excluded from the operation of the new section 39C. He also said that he had been advised by his legal advisors that the best way of dealing with matters was to pass this Bill and then also to pass a separate Bill dealing with chiropractors, in which they were to be exempted from these provisions. I think the same difficulty arose last year when we had the identical Bill. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulties were, as I understand the situation, that he could not exclude them from the provisions of this Bill by excluding them specifically therein, because there was no definition of a chiropractor. One understands those difficulties. A formula has been devised whereby under the Bill withdrawn and the existing Bill, chiropractors are to be, if that Bill is passed by the House and this Bill becomes law, exempted from the operation of section 39C. We do not have that Bill before us. We do not know whether it will be passed by this House or by this Parliament. If it is not passed by this House and by Parliament, of course the power will exist to do far more to the chiropractors than the existing Chiropractors Bill envisages. In other words, not only will chiropractors in future be banned, but it would be possible to restrict chiropractors presently practising in respect of what they now do. We do not know whether this Bill is going to be passed or not. We do not know whether the Chiropractors Bill is going to be put into law or not. So, Sir, the amendment which I move standing in my name on the Order Paper purports to do just this. In principle the hon. the Minister has no objection to it. He does not wish this Act to apply to chiropractors.</p>

<p>There has been provided a substitute for a definition in the Chiropractors Bill. That is that persons who are practising for gain as chiropractors are excluded. If anyone is charged with contravening this section, the onus shall be on him to prove that he is doing acts which were normally done by chiropractors. There is no definition, but the onus is on him to show that in fact and in practice these are acts done by chiropractors and shall be excluded. All it will do, is to add another section, 39D, excluding chiropractors, as defined by the hon. the Minister in both his Bills. It is not really a definition, but it describes nevertheless the persons and the activities in that manner, excluding them from the provisions of this Bill. I hope that the hon. the Minister will see that, while there is no definition, all that this amendment proposes to do, is to take his proposed definition in the Chiropractors Bill, put it into this Bill and exclude those persons contemplated in the Chiropractors Bill from the operation of section 39C. That is the effect of doing this. What he does in the Chiropractors Bill, we hope he will be able to do in this Bill. The wording of the formula is not ours; it is the formula of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s. I hope that he will see his way clear to accept this amendment, which, as he has indicated, in principle he is not against.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, unfortunately this is not such an easy matter as the hon. member has just stated it to be. I have an idea the hon. member knows it is not. Let me say at once that right from the beginning, ever since last year, it has never been my intention or that of the Department that this Bill, and specifically section 39C, should affect the chiropractors. I have given them this undertaking and, as I have already said here, I am prepared to keep that promise.</p>

<p><span class="col_1859-1860" refersTo="page_0943"/>A further intention was to exclude them in this legislation. On the advice of the law advisers it was decided to introduce a separate Bill for regulating matters relating to chiropractics, instead of including it in this legislation. The hon. member said that in principle I would have no objection to what he was proposing. This, of course, is not correct. What is the hon. member proposing in effect&#x003F; I have emphasized throughout, and this is also contained in the Bill dealing with chiropractics, that in future a list will be kept of persons practising at present and of students studying at present. Only these persons will be excluded from the provisions of section 39C. Now the hon. member is proposing the exclusion of any person who may in future practise chiropractics. Surely there is a world of difference between these two things. If we were to do this, we would be doing an extremely irresponsible thing in this regard. Whereas we are now introducing supplementary control over all medical auxiliary services, it would mean that with regard to one group of people we would be providing that they would be entirely excluded, that, as far as they were concerned, there would be no control and no training and that they could proceed in the present way now and in future.</p>

<p>But you could make the same provision in the Chiropractors Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>No, there it would only apply to those who are practising at present and who are studying at present. Since 1928 it has been law in South Africa that any person who wants to make a diagnosis or who wants to apply treatment must have basic training not below a certain minimum. Since 1928 it has been the rule that anyone who wants to practise as a dentist, for example, must have basic training not below a certain minimum. If he does not have that and passes himself off as practising as such, he is liable to punishment. Now the hon. member is saying that this is perfectly in order as far as all other persons are concerned, but no rules, no control whatsoever, are required for anyone who says he is practising chiropractics.</p>

<p>I can restrict it later, but I am not going to land myself in difficulties now just to try to get out of them later. The hon. member will realize that I cannot accept this amendment under any circumstances. The hon. member asked, and this is a fair argument, how we could be sure that this House would pass that Bill which deals with chiropractors. But if this House is prepared to accept this Bill as it stands, the one which is before us now, I can see no problem in connection with the passing of the Chiropractors Bill, because it wants to prevent the very thing we seek to prevent in this Bill. I cannot accept the argument of the hon. member. Indeed, I believe the hon. member himself would have second thoughts if I were to accept it now, because it would mean that we would be taking a step in the wrong direction with regard to control over persons diagnosing and treating the public, a step which South Africa definitely would not like to see, particularly not after we had reached such heights in the sphere of medicine. I am sorry, therefore, that I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member because of its far-reaching implications.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. G. L. HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I find the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument an extraordinary one. He says it is not his intention under this Bill to control or in any way affect chiropractors. Yet he says he cannot accept this amendment on the grounds that this Bill deals generally with all paramedical services; why should we therefore exclude one category of persons while covering all the rest&#x003F; But, Mr. Chairman, the Minister must be honest with this House, he must be quite open with this House. The question is whether he intends or does not intend in terms of the Bill which is now before the House to deal with chiropractors adversely&#x2014;in other words, to control them in some way, to restrict their practice or prevent them from practising at all. Does he or does he not. He cannot expect the House to accept his explanation that on the one hand he does not want to exclude them because the acts they perform form part and parcel of paramedical acts and consequently cannot exclude them from this Bill, and on the other hand to want us to believe that it is not his intention to control them under this legislation. If he does not wish this Bill to affect in any way the practice of chiropractors &#x2014;it does not matter whether it is those who are at present practising or those who may come in in future&#x2014;and the Minister <span class="col_1861-1862" refersTo="page_0944"/>has said that it is not his intention, then he ought to be able to accept this amendment. The other question whether those who ought to be allowed to practise should only be those who practise at present and those who are studying or whether it should also include others who may qualify in future, is a matter for discussion under the Chiropractors Bill; it has nothing to do with this amendment, nothing whatsoever. He cannot rely on that argument in an endeavour to justify his refusal to accept this amendment. On this side of the House we are very concerned with the position of chiropractors. I do not want to enter into discussion about the Bill which is on the Order Paper but not yet before us. Whether or not we will be satisfied with that Bill is a matter for discussion when the Bill comes up. But I want to repeat that we on this side of the House are very concerned about the position of chiropractors.</p>

The Minister has made it perfectly clear that in terms of the provisions of this Bill chiropractors could be restricted in their practice. The terms of this Bill are wide enough to make it possible for them to be restricted in their practice.

<p>I quite agree that up till now they have carried on their practice not under any law, but the very point that we make is that this law which is now before the Committee could enable the Medical Council to declare the acts which are now being performed by chiropractors to be acts which should be performed not by chiropractors but by other sections of the medical profession as such. There is no doubt about it that the provisions of the Bill could exclude chiropractors from practice, not only the ones who are in practice at present but all future chiropractors who may wish to come to this country to practise or who may wish to qualify in this country for practice.</p>

<p>The question as to whether or not we are prepared to leave them uncontrolled is another matter entirely. They have not been subject to control up to now. What is more, since the publication of the report of this commission in 1962, I think I am correct in saying, a report on which the Government now relies to pass legislation against the chiropractors nothing whatsoever has been done by the Government against chiropractice. It is now 1971, so the Government cannot argue that they have been a danger to the public, because if they have been a danger to the public why have they been allowed to continue since 1962&#x003F; It is in this report that the commissioners said that their profession is not scientifically based. If the hon. the Minister thought that this was a serious matter which required attention, why has he done nothing about it since 1962&#x003F; No, the hon. the Minister and members on the Government side must be quite frank with this House and with the public and the voters. Do they or do they not wish to allow chiropractors to continue in practice&#x003F; If they do, they must give better reasons for refusing to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban North.</p>

<p>Order! Before calling upon the hon. member for Brentwood to speak, I wish to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that there is another Bill on the Table of this House, i.e. the Chiropractors Bill. Consequently, even though the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North does raise this matter, I should not like to allow at this stage a wide and general discussion on the pros and cons of chiropractors.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your ruling because that is <span class="col_1863-1864" refersTo="page_0945"/>what this entire problem is about, but hon. members of the Opposition do not want to recognize this. The Committee has already agreed to certain clauses of the Bill under discussion; we have now proceeded to clause 7, and the opposite side of this House agreed to clause 2 of this Bill without any opposition, one to which I want to refer back in order to relate it to the matter now under discussion. The proposed section 13A (1) inserted by clause 2, which has been agreed to, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the council &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the Medical Council, which was discredited by the hon. member for Berea&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; deems it in the public interest that a professional board be established in respect of any profession in respect of which a register is kept under section 32, or in respect of two or more such professions &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here we are dealing with a Bill covering certain professions which already exist and which render supplementary services to the medical profession, in order to afford those people the opportunity of regulating their affairs when the Medical Council deems it fit that they should comply with compulsory registration and certain rules and regulations. This is what we are dealing with and it has nothing whatsoever to do with any other profession. If the hon. member now wants to bring in chiropractors, whom he has not defined, he should by the same token move an amendment in respect of neuropaths and osteopaths, etc. He cannot simply single out one, because this does not concern those people who are outside. This entire piece of legislation concerns the people who are inside. If this legislation happens to create a position in which those people are affected, they have to be saved from the outside, by their own organizations. This is the only place where we find any bond between this legislation and the legislation which will possibly follow this, in other words, the other legislation to follow this has to make provision either for chiropractors or for osteopaths or for whomsoever, who are not recognized by the Medical Council as an auxiliary service as laid down in clause 2 of this Bill. In that case we shall have to pass other legislation for them as well.</p>

<p>In addition, I should just like to quote this. Sir, this is now being turned into something political.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member for Musgrave clearly said we had to say whether we were for or against chiropractors. He is now trying to force the discussion of something which is not relevant. I just want to tell the hon. member that the Chiropractic Association in one of their circulars signed by their secretary, said the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have never opposed the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Amendment Bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is the one now under discussion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; nor are we doing so now. We feel that it will not affect straight chiropractors, as we are not encroaching on the paramedical field.</block>

<p>If they prove that they are not transgressing this Act, it has nothing to do with us. I cannot understand the hon. member for Durban North and Musgrave, who have had basic scientific training. The hon. members belong to one of the most honourable professions in this country with a scientific training. They, too, have a code and a higher authority regulating matters for them, just as I, as a medical practitioner, am under the control of the Medical Council. Now they want to accept something as scientific which is not acceptable to the Medical Council in the context of this Bill. Let us go back to 1934 when the attorneys and notaries had similar basic legislation, Act No. 23 of 1934, before this House of Assembly. The same principle was applicable when the attorneys and notaries wanted to put their case. At that time they alone put their case, what was of interest to them, how they were to maintain their rules and discipline and what minimum requirement were essential for them. This Act of 1934 does not make any reference anywhere to other people outside. The legislation now before this House is similar.</p>

Then he says we are trying to make a political issue of it. Surely we are all here as representatives of the people and if the rights, not only of the chiropractors, but the rights of the many thousands of people are affected, we must do something. Obviously, I have nothing against the medical profession, but I include myself amongst those whose rights are affected.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, most certainly I think that the chiropractors should be allowed to continue. That is the object of this operation. Let me say that, when one talks of a political issue, everything we deal with here are political issues. A member of Parliament must make a decision which he believes in as a representative, as he is, of his people. He must decide, if we divide on this clause, where he stands in relation to his constituency and whether he wants the chiropractors excluded from the operation of this Bill or not. The hon. the Minister says that he is not going to apply this and does not intend applying it to chiropractors. If that is so, when an amendment is proposed which says that the sanctions in section 39C will not be applied to chiropractors, if the hon. the Minister really means what he says and in principle agrees and if this hon. member, who has just spoken and every other hon. member sitting there agrees, they should vote for the amendment. If they do not do so, they give notice to the people they represent in this House, that they do not want the chiropractors excluded from the operation of this section. It is as simple as that.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that he cannot accept this amendment under any circumstances, because it goes too far and protects all of them. That it is what it is intended to do. At this stage we do not know whether we will get the Chiropractors Bill, whether it is going to be passed, or withdrawn again, or whether it is going to be changed. All we know is that we have at this stage this Bill, which can exclude chiropractors from operating.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree, it can exclude others too. My amendment deals with chiropractors and it is in that regard that the question before the House on my particular amendment is how members feel about whether or not chiropractors should practise. One speaks here, not on behalf of one&#x2019;s political party, but on behalf of one&#x2019;s constituents, or one should. Let no one come along and say that this is not going to deal with or could not deal with chiropractors. One can look at both Bills relating to chiropractors, and one sees there a specific reference to section 39C, where they are specifically excluded from this provision. If one can have it in that Bill, then one can have it in this Bill. At this stage we have no Chiropractors Bill before us. We merely have the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that it will not deal with chiropractors and we have his assurance that, in principle, he has no objection. We have provided a formula taken from the Minister&#x2019;s own Bill on chiropractors. It says that chiropractors should be excluded. The simple question on this amendment is that you either want them to be or you do not. When you vote, you will say to yourself, to the House and to your constituents: We want chiropractors to be dealt with by the Medical Council and, if necessary, have their wings clipped, because they can be, on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own admission by his introduction of the Chiropractors Bill. We will be saying: We are not prepared to allow them to be excluded. It is really as simple as that. It is not a political issue. It is an issue before the House. You want them excluded or you do not want them excluded. Will the hon. the Minister now say what his attitude is&#x003F; Then I am sure that the others will follow him as they usually do through that little opening in the kraal where you normally count the sheep.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Durban North is now dragging in a matter by its hair, and he and I do not have much!</p>

<p>The chiropractors are not at all concerned in this legislation before us. The only persons who are mentioned by name in this Bill and who are being excluded specifically, are the so-called cancer doctors or cancer quacks. A ban is not being placed by this legislation on any other person who can satisfy the Medical Council with regard to its scientific test for registration. <span class="col_1867-1868" refersTo="page_0947"/>Now the hon. member for Durban North says the only issue before this House is whether we are for or against chiropractors. Now my challenge to that hon. member is to tell us whether he is for or against scientific training. Any profession operating in the medical field and paramedical field which can stand the test of science may be registered in terms of this legislation. I challenge the hon. member to prove the contrary.</p>

<p>But now the hon. member comes along and drags in another matter by its hair, because the hon. member for Berea has once again tried, just as he did the other day with regard to the question of drugs, to make a little bit of miserable political capital out of this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#janson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. N. H. JANSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to draw attention to one point in the proposed amendment and ask the hon. member by whom the amendment was proposed exactly what he means by it. The hon. member proposed that &#x201C;the provisions of sections 32 and 39A shall not apply in respect of any person who is practising for gain as a chiropractor in the Republic&#x201D;. What I read into this, is that the hon. member wants any person who has started practising as a chiropractor, even if he has only a Std. Six certificate, to receive full recognition as a chiropractor. What I also read in this amendment, is that a person who has gained no scientific knowledge, not even in that particular field of study in which, as is being suggested&#x2014;and I assume this&#x2014;experience may be gained, should in fact be admitted as a chiropractor. Can anything be more ridiculous than that&#x003F; I should like to issue a challenge to the Opposition to let us hear what the hon. member for Rosettenville has to say about the attitude of the Medical Council in respect of people who have to receive scientific training. Notice has been given in this House of the introduction of a Bill which will deal with chiropractors. It has been ruled that we may not discuss it, and I gladly abide by that ruling. But if this matter is taken so far that the hon. Opposition is trying to make political capital out of it, as people have already tried to do in the Press, I just want to point out to the hon. member that this kind of legislation, which does at least exercise control over every single profession that falls under medicine, is being introduced for the protection of these people.</p>

<p>Any legislation such as the legislation being introduced now, is intended to serve as protection not only for the public, but also for that particular profession. That is why the method was followed that was in fact followed by the hon. the Minister. That is why it is possible for me to feel absolutely free to vote for this Bill as it was proposed by the hon. the Minister, and I can account for it fully.</p>

<p>But I should like to ask once again what I asked a moment ago, i.e. what the hon. member for Rosettenville has to say in respect of the non-training of people who pretend to be medical practitioners and who then practice the medical profession. In conclusion I may just point out that in the very ranks of the chiropractic profession there are people who have expressed their concern at the fact that there are persons who are practising as chiropractors and who are by no means qualified to do so. If such a clause were inserted for the protection of any person who practises as a chiropractor, it would merely prove how irresponsible an Opposition can be in that it wants to tell the public that any person who wishes to practise as a chiropractor at all, may receive his two month&#x2019;s training or no training whatsoever, and he will be welcome according to the proposer of this amendment.</p>

<p>If they can be dealt with under this Bill, it means that the Minister, under this Bill, can do what he wishes to do under the Chiropractors Bill. That is how it appears to me. Therefore, the Chiropractors Bill is redundant if he goes on with this Bill. The Chiropractors Bill becomes a Bill which is duplicating the Minister&#x2019;s intention. That is the first point. People had that doubt in their minds and that doubt has now been removed by the Minister. That doubt had been expressed by members on the Government side of the <span class="col_1869-1870" refersTo="page_0948"/>House, but that doubt is now removed.

<p>The hon. the Minister must just give me the opportunity to finish. The next point is that there is not a single member on this side of the House who wants the chiropractors to be allowed to practise his profession unless he is trained to do so. Now, the difficulty that has arisen, as far as chiropractors are concerned, and they say this themselves, is their inability to have some recognized standards of training and control. Now what is the hon. the Minister doing&#x003F; The Minister is prolonging the life of people who have not been trained. Whether they have been trained in America, or whether they have been trained at the bottom of Adderley Street, he is prolonging the life of the untrained people as well as the trained.</p>

What their qualifications are, and how they got those qualifications, is a different basis of argument. He has said here that he will not interfere with the chiropractors who are at present training as chiropractors. He has also said that he will not interfere with the students who are training.

That is what I am doing now. I say that the present Bill could eliminate chiropractors if the hon. the Minister wishes to do so. He has yet another weapon, and that is the Chiropractors Bill which may come before us. He will then have both those methods to deal with chiropractors. When that Bill comes before the House, we will deal with the merits of chiropractors, but that is a different story. Here I say all that we are doing on this side of the House is to give the Minister one weapon instead of two. That is what we are doing. We want them to be excluded from this Bill and what happens with them in the next Bill will be seen when that Bill comes in front of this House. That is all we have to say in this matter.</p>

<p>When they are properly trained they will be admitted by the Medical Council as a paramedical service. Is that correct and is that what the hon. member wants&#x003F; If they are a properly trained profession they can get recognition by the Medical Council and become a paramedical profession. If that is the case the hon. the Minister will be empowered by this Bill to recognize them as such and give them protection as a profession. Having them properly qualified will protect the public as well. This is what the hon. the Minister is aiming at in this Bill. He wants to protect them until they have acquired such recognition. The hon. the Minister intends to bring the Bill on Chiropractors before this House in order to protect those that are at present practising as chiropractors and to enable them to carry on with their work. Until such time as they have put their house in order those that are practising will be protected under the Bill proposed by the hon. the Minister. But when they have put their house in order they will be, as any other paramedical service, entitled to become a fully recognized paramedical <span class="col_1871-1872" refersTo="page_0949"/>service. Therefore I feel there is no sense in adopting the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North which would preclude them from getting proper recognition, as they may get later under this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I must say that the position is becoming more and more interesting, or perhaps I should say curiouser and curiouser as a result of the explanation of the hon. member for Geduld. It would seem that the Nationalist Party caucus has been told one thing and this House another by the hon. the Minister. The hon. the Minister certainly did not tell this House what the hon. member for Geduld has just told us was the intention of this Bill, namely to bring the chiropractors under the wing of the Medical Council once they qualify. This is exactly what the hon. the Minister did not tell the House. I think that if any speech made in this debate warrants this House voting in favour of the amendment of the hon. member for Durban North, it is the speech of the hon. member for Geduld. We are now perfectly clear what the intention of the hon. the Minister is with this Bill. We are grateful to the hon. member for Geduld for spelling it out to us so clearly.</p>

<p>I would also like to react to the speech of the hon. member for Witbank. He has complained that we are introducing an amendment to protect chiropractors without laying down any qualification at all. He asks with horror and indignation whether we are prepared to allow a man with a Standard 6 certificate to practise as a chiropractor. If the hon. member for Witbank is so indignant about the lack of qualifications of chiropractors and if that is the argument of hon. members on that side of the House, why have they not come to this House with a Bill to protect the public against the lack of qualifications of chiropractors&#x003F; Chiropractors have been practising for many years without any specific requirement. What is more curious, in terms of this Bill which the Government proposes to introduce to deal with chiropractors &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, the hon. member must allow me to develop my argument. He must just be patient. In terms of the Bill which this Government proposes to introduce to deal with chiropractors which is on the Order Paper they propose to recognize the present practitioners and those who are in training without laying down any qualifications whatsoever. So what nonsense does the hon. member for Witbank talk that he objects to our amendment because we do not lay down any qualifications&#x003F; It becomes obvious, the more this clause is being debated, that what the Government really has in mind, is to be able to control the chiropractor under this Bill. Unless the hon. the Minister and the members on the Government benches support the amendment by the hon. member for Durban North, the public and the voters who support the Government will be entitled to come to exactly the same conclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Durban North proposes but one thing. That is that in future anyone who professes to be practising chiropractics will have <i>carte blanche</i> to carry on without control, qualifications or anything. That is the implication.

<p>All right. It is rather strange that the amendment comes from the hon. member for Durban North because in 1962 we had before this House a private member&#x2019;s Bill. In that Bill it was proposed that chiropractors continue, but that there should be strict control and registers kept. It is much stricter than the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. I opposed that private member&#x2019;s Bill, and I read here in Hansard (1962, column 1290):</p>

This makes me think that there has not been compliance with my request during the Second-Reading debate, i.e. that political capital should not be made out of health matters. This is politicizing and nothing else. But let me repeat that I am not going to allow myself to be misled into dragging chiropractors across the floor of this House. They are decent people.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have a good understanding with them. We understand each other. If the vested rights of chiropractors were to be affected in the future, I should do something to prevent those rights from being affected. That is why there is another Bill on the Table before us. I say vested rights, and I define them specifically as those who are practising and those who are studying.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave wanted to know why we did not prohibit it altogether; but over the years it has been the tradition of this House and of South Africa that one does not come forward with a total prohibition, but that we have respect and regard for vested rights, and that we carry these qualities into effect in legislation. That is precisely what is going to happen in this case.</p>

<p>But did the hon. member for Durban North give us his interpretation of the matter&#x003F; What is the intention of this clause&#x003F; I think I should now come back to the clause and outline the situation as it is today. The position at present is that only medical practitioners, dentists and nurses must be registered in South Africa. But at present there is no control whatever over any other person who, in any other sphere, wants to treat or diagnose, etc., the human body. Now, in this clause we are providing that as from the date of the promulgation of this legislation, control will be exercised, as it is done in the case of the medical practitioner and the dentist, over any person in South Africa who wants to treat, diagnose or touch the human body in regard to its health. If this is not a major step forward, I do not know what it is. In this legislation no single profession, including that of the chiropractors, is mentioned by name. This is going to affect not only chiropractors, but also any profession or person wishing to treat or diagnose the human body. Since this is the case, I am not prepared to exclude one single profession. Why does the hon. member not ask me to exclude other professions as well&#x003F; What is the position going to be if this legislation is passed&#x003F; It will mean that the Medical Council will be able to register and recognize any profession if its members are satisfied with the training. In the years that lie ahead this council may also register chiropractors if it is satisfied with their basic training. Those people who are practising that profession at present, will not be deprived by me of that privilege, and it is in fact with a view to the possibility that the Medical Council may eventually recognize them that I say this. I am not prepared to exclude one single profession from this legislation.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Musgrave asked me to be honest and open. But that I have been and what is more, I am taking the same line I took in 1962. May I say that I have had no opposition against this Bill from anybody, except from the Opposition. In this Bill we are taking steps to make it possible for anyone who may possibly treat or diagnose the human body to be placed under control and be registered. That being the case I am not prepared to write in here the name of any specific organization, neither chiropractors nor anybody else. After this Bill becomes law and it appears to me that it affects the vested right of chiropractors adversely, I shall guard against it and give them the opportunity to ensure that their vested rights will not be affected.</p>

<p>*Let us now turn the thing around. Let us suppose we accepted the amendment of the hon. member and entirely excluded one group of people from this legislation. Then suppose that in the course of the present session or at a later stage we wanted to do something in regard to chiropractors. Would we be able to do something if we now accepted the amendment of the hon. member&#x003F; No, what would have to happen then, would be that we would have to repeal his amendment first. I am not as clueless as that, even if I am not a lawyer. Surely, I am not going to accept a thing now which, later on, I would have to repeal first. If we wanted this legislation to mean something, we would first have to withdraw the amendment of the hon. member, i.e. if we accepted it. And, surely, that would be tantamount to setting about things in a back to front way. The hon. member admits that with this amendment he wants to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the whole chiropractic profession. If, at a later stage, we wanted to impose certain restrictions on them, we would have to repeal the <i>carte blanche</i> clause first. That is why I say that I am not prepared to accept this amendment <span class="col_1875-1876" refersTo="page_0951"/>Why did we come here with this Bill&#x003F; It is not because I thought it up or because it was thought up by the Department of Health, but because the Medical Council has over the years been asking for this <i>magna charta</i> in order that the paramedical professions&#x2014;I think there are 41 of them&#x2014;may be protected and minimum qualifications may be laid down for them. I am not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment. Sir, what is our duty in this House&#x003F; The hon. member mounted a high pedestal here and asked What is our duty in this House&#x003F; I do not know how he sees it, but every member sitting here has in regard to this legislation just one duty, just one objective, and that is not to protect any profession; it is to afford the public of South Africa the protection to which they are entitled. That is all that is being done by this Bill. What kind of protection&#x003F; The object of the Bill is to afford the public of South Africa this minimum protection, i.e. that any person who touches or looks at the body of a South African for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment, should have received minimum training, irrespective of his profession, irrespective of whether or not it is a supplementary medical profession.</p>

<p>No, Sir, this is the whole point.

We exclude them as they have been for the last 50 years, or whatever the period may be, in the country, and as they are now from the operation of the proposed section 39C. The hon. the Minister says he is not prepared to exclude anyone from the operation of the proposed new section 39C; he is not prepared to do so in this Bill but, Sir, he is prepared to do so; he has given notice of his intention to do so in the Chiropractor&#x2019;s Bill.

This is the difference, and surely the hon. the Minister appreciates that. I am very sorry, but before I sit down I just want to mention one more thing. I am very sorry that the hon. the Minister felt it necessary to refer to the fact that when a private member&#x2019;s Bill was before this House I seconded his amendment to that Chiropractors&#x2019; Bill. I do not know whether the Minister remembers what happened at that time. There was much discussion because it was a private member&#x2019;s Bill and there was a free vote. There was much discussion across the floor of the House. I am prepared to have a Select Committee look into this if my word is not accepted in this regard. The Minister will remember the discussions that we had. Dr. Aubrey Radford was one of the persons concerned. I said at the time that I liked chiropractors; I had been to a chiropractor and he did something for me after an event involving one of the Minister&#x2019;s colleagues, which I shall not describe. He got me out of some difficulty and pain that I was in at the time, as the result of the treatment, I seconded the Minister&#x2019;s amendment because that Bill, he will recall, purported to give the chiropractors the right by statutory protection to do the things that the medical profession is entitled to do.</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 17 and 52 respectively, after &#x201C;treatment&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;prevention&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I just want to tell hon. members that this improves the clause in that there is certain apparatus which is intended for the protection of persons in, for example, factories, etc. It is simply to cover that possibility, too, that this amendment is being moved. I may just say that it has only been brought to our attention during the past week that there is, indeed, such apparatus which is specifically used for the protection of persons working in such factories. We are, therefore inserting the word &#x201C;prevention&#x201D;, which improves the clause.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister if he would be good enough to give me his opinion concerning a matter in this particular clause which I raised during the Second Reading. I drew attention to the fact that at the present moment hypodermic syringes and hypodermic needles are freely available. There is no restriction whatsoever in regard to their purchase or supply. I indicated that while I was not anxious to burden my fellow professional men with any additional restrictions or red tape, I wondered whether it was wise in fact that these particular instruments should be so freely available. I realize there could be difficulty in providing a means of control. The people who need this hypodermic equipment are for instance diabetics and others. It is also used for the various veterinary remedies when farmers and others who are treating animals may require syringes and needles. However, it seems to me that perhaps some system could be adopted whereby this equipment could only be purchased on signature so that at least there would be a check on who purchases hypodermic equipment. I ask the hon. the Minister whether he has been able to give this matter consideration and what his reaction to my suggestion is likely to be.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I did give my attention to this matter and I must apologize for not replying during the Second Reading debate already.</p>

<p>The position is that the hon. member is quite right in asking what means of control one could institute. The only way that I can think of is twofold. The equipment can either be supplied on prescription or, as the hon. member has suggested, by signing some register when such equipment is being purchased. As I say, I looked into this matter, but it would be too big a burden on the public if we were to institute either of these forms of control. For that reason I see no way of complying with the hon. member&#x2019;s wishes in this regard. The hon. member must not forget that there are so many people who are badly in need of syringes for their own treatment, and he has quite rightly mentioned diabetics and others. But farmers also use syringes in large quantities. In future I think it would be better, as we do contemplate, to take control over the substances that they inject rather than to take control over syringes. However, I think it would be too big a burden on the public if the necessary control is taken to see to it that syringes are not as freely available as they are at present.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the debate on the development of the Bantu homelands goes to the heart of the political dialogue in South Africa. It indicates to us the beacons marking off the courses along which the various political parties want to lead South Africa, and it gives us an indication of the changes awaiting us on the political scene. To be able to form a proper opinion of this political scene, one must take cognisance of a few external facts.</p>

<p>The first fact which I think is important, is the fact that the <i>Sunday Times</i> has a political column which is written by a certain Hogarth de Hoogh. I take it that various journalists contribute to this column. However, it is also important to know that Hogarth de Hoogh is the pseudonym of a certain person. I want to suggest, in fact this is quite true, that the hon. <span class="col_1885-1886" refersTo="page_0956"/>member for Kensington writes under the name of Hogarth de Hoogh. He is Hogarth de Hoogh and he is also responsible for what appears in this column. Another important aspect of which we must take cognisance is that there is in the ranks of the United Party, as represented here in this House, a restlessness, a dissatisfaction and a frustration which is gradually becoming clearer. I am absolutely sure that I am correct when I say that this is beautifully illustrated by the actions of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. He furnished a definition of petty apartheid here. This definition of the hon. member is to a great extent Progressive policy. The hon. member was repudiated by his Leader, but he has not yet told us whether he agrees with that repudiation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am quite certain that we are going to hear more about it, and when we hear about it again, I am certain the hon. member for Bezuidenhout will be prepared to take a further pace away from the leadership of the United Party. The hon. member made an important statement on the Immorality Act. In the debate here last week he was again repudiated as far as his attitude towards the Immorality Act is concerned.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member is going a little too far now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>On top of all this, we have now had a shift in emphasis in the policy of the Progressive Party in respect of their attitude to the development of the Bantu homelands. The Progressive Party says that they, too, see for the future of South Africa a policy which will have to be geo-political. South Africa will have to be territorially subdivided for the various peoples in South Africa, White and non-White. In this regard there is an agreement between the policy of the United Party and that of the Progressive Party. They see a federal set-up for South Africa. The same political structure is being envisaged for South Africa by these two parties, namely a federal government, to which the various states or provinces, whatever they call them, belong. The political structure foreseen for South Africa by the Progressives and the United Party is precisely the same. They differ on the franchise and the constitution of that federal government, but in my opinion they are only differing still at this stage.</p>

<p>Now it is important to note that one of the members of the United Party, under the pseudonym of Hogarth de Hoogh, took a very firm step in the direction of supporting the Progressive Party. I want to refer to yesterday&#x2019;s edition, 28th February, in which the hon. member for Kensington said: &#x201C;Would a moral society allow these things&#x003F;&#x201D; Then he asked the question: &#x201C;Would a moral society tolerate the Immorality Act&#x003F;&#x201D; These are Progressive Party words, surely. Then he continues: &#x201C;Would a moral society tell its non-White citizens that they must not use the same bus or sit on the same park bench, or ride in the same taxi as the White citizens&#x003F;&#x201D; This is Progressive Party policy which is being proclaimed here. But now&#x2014;I just want to refer to this in passing&#x2014;there is an image-building article in this same newspaper on Colin Eglin, the leader of the Progressive Party, which concludes with this paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<p>Now the hon. the leader of the Progressive Party has already done two things to bring more &#x201C;dynamism&#x201D; and activity into the political scene. The first to which I referred a moment ago, is the shift in emphasis which took place in respect of the Progressive Party in so far that it is the opposite of the policy for the development of the Bantu homelands and the alternative which they present. This is the view which the Progressive Party held in this connection.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. L. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we now find that these actions on the part of the Progressive Party is meeting with a response in the United Party. This morning there was a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on the federal state and the development of the homelands as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout sees it. According to this edition of the newspaper the hon. member for Bezuidenhout says&#x2014;I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He &#x2026;</block>

<p>that is, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; sees the federal idea by contrast as being unconcerned with colour and therefore equally unconcerned with coercive apartheid or coercive integration.</block>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member for Bezuidenhout can tell us whether the reporter reported him correctly. &#x201C;He sees the federal idea by contrast as being unconcerned with colour&#x201D;. The policy of the United Party as regards their federal state, the development of the Bantu homelands and the representation which they must have in a federal state is definitely based on colour. Does the United Party not want to introduce separate voter&#x2019;s lists&#x003F; It is very clear to me that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, as far as this statement is concerned, is deviating from the policy of the United Party as it has been stated in this House.</p>

<p>I understand it well. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is moving away from the policy of the United Party and is moving in the direction of the Progressive Party. When the new leader of the Progressive Party wants to concentrate on verligte Afrikaners, then it is very clear that he thinks of people who think like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and not of persons who are not so-called verlig and Nationalists. People who, like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, think that a federal state will develop &#x201C;as being unconcerned with colour&#x201D; are people like Mr. Willem Kleynhans and others who are moving towards the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member for Bezuidenhout acknowledge the concept of multi-nationality in all its consequences. If the hon. member does accept the concept of multi-nationality and colour is no longer of importance, on what basis can the United Party then justify separate voters&#x2019; lists for the Coloureds and separate voters&#x2019; lists for the Bantu&#x003F; They want to have six White representatives elected by the Bantu on separate voters&#x2019; lists. But surely justice is not being done them to the concept of multi-nationality.</p>

<p>It is very clear to me that this legislation in regard to the development of the homelands, as it is reflected in the new attitude of the United Party and the new attitude of the Progressive Party, will lead to a new political orientation of opposition politics in South Africa, a development which we are watching with interest.</p>

<speech by="#sutton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. M. SUTTON</person>:</from>

<p>I am just replying to what the hon. member for Pretoria Central was saying. Sir, I must say that I was extremely interested not only in the attention that he gave to the Progressive Party but to the interest shown by all hon. members opposite when the hon. member for Houghton was putting out her new federal policy. I am beginning to wonder whether there may not be any truth in the story that the &#x201C;verligte&#x201D; Nationalists are starting to look to the Progressive Party for a new home. It is a most interesting development, Sir; hon. members opposite revealed their interest by the questions they were asking. When I see the rash of psychedelic shirts and fluorescent ties that have come out, to attempt to prove that hon. members on that side are switched on when we know that they are switched out, then I really begin to wonder about the future of the Nationalist Party. But, Sir, what I do not wonder about is the future of South Africa under the dispensation which is being put in the hands of this hon. Minister by this Bill. What is happening with this Bill is merely to convert this Parliament into the rubber stamp which will be applied to the blank cheque which is being given into the hands of this Minister to determine the future of all South Africa, Black South Africa as well as White South Africa. I say that the Bill that we have before us now, with the power that it places in the hands of the hon. the Minister, is going to destroy the fabric of Western civilization in this country. Sir, the civilization we have today is something which is based on a common interest, a common interest in which Black South Africa and White South Africa are working together to create what is our civilization&#x2014;the educational facilities, the employment, the housing, the health services, the things which distinguish this country from every other country in Africa, created here by the White people with their leadership and their initiative, their financial knowledge and their financial power and by Black South Africa with the mass labour that they provide. It is an interest that is common to Black South Africa and White South Africa. But, Sir, with this Bill the hon. the Minister is creating, or taking unto his hands the power to create ultimately, eight mini-Black States and one state which will be White on top and the whole base of it resting on the Bantu people who are cut off completely, in the Nationalist Party theory, from any kind of interest in this country, the land, the place in which they reside. Sir, we have heard of the idol which had feet of clay. Here we have precisely the same kind of set-up being created in this country, where you will have a mini-White state of some million people, resting on a base of ten or twelve million Black people to whom any kind of right in this area is denied by the Nationalist Party. What will happen then, Sir, is that the interest that we have in common today will be parcelled out into eight or nine or ten or twelve separate selfish personal interests, personal to every single one of those groups or homelands or countries which are being set up by the Nationalist Party and that, Sir, will destroy Western civilization in this country, because civilization is a thing of association, it is a thing of the mind; it is a process whereby you reach out to the imagination and the thought processes of people who are less civilized. You take them and you direct their thoughts and their whole thinking and their way of life and everything else into a new pattern and a new direction. What is happening here is that there is being created deliberately in our country totally different ideas; people are being forced apart into different directions; people are being forced to turn in upon themselves. Instead of contributing to the common good of all the people in South Africa, the Bantu people are today being forced to turn upon and into themselves and to seek in themselves their own salvation and to develop and generate a selfish interest for themselves at the expense of the common good.</p>

<p>And Lesotho. These small countries are simply not able to cope. They are the despair of the world and they are more inclined to draw into some kind of association because they know they are too small. I said during the Second Reading that this Bill was merely a dead end; you were merely directing the Bantu people of South Africa into a dead end. And the hon. the Minister got most upset about it. But this is what is happening. These states will not be able to survive in isolation. They will have to come back into some kind of association. Even the Nationalist Prime Minister, Dr. Verwoerd, said there would have to be some kind of a commonwealth in which there would be eight Black states and one White state, simply to maintain this kind of contact between White South Africa and Black South Africa. Our country is being torn apart simply for the reason that this Nationalist Party cannot see that by maintaining and holding together what is now together and is growing together, we will be able to withstand, as we have with stood, the whole attack of the world. By breaking it down and creating separate and dividing influences we are ruining our own position. It is not that we just want to be selfish and care for our own personal interest, but we bear in our hands the light of civilization, and surely that is what is important in the context in which we live today. We stand as a group in this darkening Continent of Africa where the lights are going out one after the other. White South Africa stands with a light in its hand, but here we have a Nationalist Party which has turned its back on that light, on the mission which we were put here to carry out. I have pleasure in supporting the amendment of the hon. member for Transkei.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to examine one idea of the last speaker, the hon. member for Mooi River&#x2014;it is in fact the only one he expressed&#x2014;namely, that of the destruction of Western civilization in South Africa which would allegedly be caused by this legislation before us. Sir, I think it is a terrible over-taxing of one&#x2019;s intelligence and imagination to make a statement like that. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Mooi River and members on his side who apparently agree with him in this regard, do not seem to realize what we have said so many times, i.e. that the political system maintained by us as the National Party Government, ensures that this Parliament, as the strongest and most important bastion for the protection of civilization and everything concerning mankind in South Africa, is to be kept exclusively in the hands of the Whites of South Africa; and if there ever was a strong bastion and a perpetuation of Christian civilization in South Africa, it is this Parliament. It is this instrument of authority which the hon. member for Mooi River and his entire party want to share with all the non-White nations in South Africa, with the Bantu as well as with the Indians and the Coloured people, and this cannot be instrumental in promoting Western civilization, as the hon. member pleaded.</p>

<p>The hon. member went further. He said that by our policy the Bantu nations were being driven away and rejected. It is not true that we are driving the Bantu nations away and rejecting them. This is what the hon. member said. The hon. member for Durban Point and others who share his <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_0960"/>line of thought are forever telling us that we are keeping the Bantu too close to us and are not bringing about proper separation as there ought to be. Everything we do is alleged to be integration or to lead to it. One moment we are told that we are fraternizing too much with the Bantu nations, while the next moment the hon. member says that we are chasing and driving them away from us. In our policy in regard to the Bantu nations or any other non-White nation in South Africa, there is no such thing as chasing them away, estranging them or driving them away. We grant each of those Bantu nations, in the same way as we grant it to the other two non-White nations in South Africa as well, the same self-realization and self-fulfilment which we as Whites claim for ourselves, <i>inter alia,</i> in this Parliament. We do not begrudge them what we want for ourselves. How the hon. member can regard that as a chasing away and a frightening off of the Bantu nations, is beyond one&#x2019;s comprehension.</p>

<p>In the hon. member&#x2019;s reference to Swaziland he said: Yes, it was wrong that Swaziland had also been allowed to follow its own course, because with Swaziland a combined and greater Southern African interest and unity could have been established among everyone. The hon. member nods his agreement that I have quoted his words correctly. I think this is something abominable that the hon. member said. We all know what is meant by &#x201C;in one communal Southern African context&#x201D;, which is greater than the Republic and Swaziland together. We know what the numerical ratio between White and Black in this Southern African geographical entity is. What the hon. member said is an ill-considered statement which does nothing but conjure up a limited Pan-Africanistic reality here in South Africa. This is what would have happened. Surely we cannot accept that an increasing number of non-White nations in Southern Africa will be prepared to serve voluntarily under a small group of Whites in this Parliament. Surely they will want to realize themselves either in this Parliament or in their own units. I do not think that hon. member had any arguments for discussing this.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to trends of thought that were raised here last Friday, especially in the speech by the hon. member for Houghton. Last Friday I think the hon. member for Houghton raised the veil which had been lifted ever so slightly at their congress by her kindred spirit, Dr. De Beer, a little further and showed us more. Sir, it does not often happen that a lady shows one more. Here it did happen. I shall be sorry if some of my colleagues in this House become over-enthusiastic.</p>

<p>I should like to reassure the hon. member for Transkei first. In case he does not know it, I just want to say that it is of course completely unacceptable to me to pay any attention to his amendment, so much so that I am not even going to discuss it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s speech, and especially the delightful exchange of words with the hon. member for Pinelands and other United Party members during her speech, once again very clearly contrasted the fundamental considerations which are relevant in this Bill, namely what the political views or aspects of the policies of the various political parties in South Africa are in regard to the Bantu nations. What are their political aspects&#x003F; We are now not referring to the agricultural aspects, educational aspects, etc. It is only the political aspects of the policy which are, more than anything else, relevant in this Bill. We say in this Bill that we are opening the way even wider for allowing the Bantu nations to fulfil themselves to an increasing extent under the principle of self-determination. As we stated in the preamble, it can even lead to independence. We have seen here very clearly that, although even our fiercest political opponents in the United Party and in the much smaller Progressive Party have in the past opposed us very vehemently in respect of our concept of Bantu homelands, all those Opposition groups are now accepting the concept of Bantu homelands, though not&#x2014;and I hasten to say this&#x2014;in accordance with our political policy as the National Party. The United Party already accepts the concept of Bantu homelands. We know this because it is stated in their yellow booklet and in their other statements of policy as well. The hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s party accepts it now as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member must give me a chance now. We always hear in this Parliament that this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development is failing day after day, that, according to <span class="col_1895-1896" refersTo="page_0961"/>them, it is failing more and more. If the concept of Bantu homelands is now being accepted and is being accepted by the Opposition, the United Party on the other side as well as the Progressive Party, although not along the same political basis as our policy, then it can surely not be regarded as a failure from the point of view of the unfolding of the National Party&#x2019;s policy. If the concept of Bantu homelands, which is our concept, is accepted and they want to apply it in their way, then it is at least some kind of victory for this National Party. If the concept of Bantu homelands, which is now accepted by them, is still regarded by them as a failure, then becoming a Republic has also failed, because there is nothing they opposed more vehemently than becoming a Republic. Now they accept this too, but at the time it was a failure. This is the political logic of the Opposition.</p>

If we listened perspicaciously and paid analytical attention to the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s speech, to her party&#x2019;s congress of a week or more ago and to the statements of policy of the Opposition Party, it is as clear as the rising sun that there are at least four clear points of agreement between their two policies.

<p>In the 18 years the hon. member for Houghton and I have been sitting together in this House, I have never seen her so much on the defensive as she was in this House last Friday. I have never yet seen her so much on the defensive in regard to her own case. My time is very limited. Let me quickly mention the four points.</p>

<p>In the first place, there is the federal scheme. Federalism has always been the United Party&#x2019;s policy in terms of race federation. This we know. It is an old point. But from the Progressive Party&#x2019;s congress and the hon. member for Houghton&#x2019;s statements here, we learn that they are for the first time talking about a federal scheme.</p>

[Interjections.] Sir, those hon. members must not shout me down now to such an extent that I cannot complete these four points in the limited time at my disposal.</p>

<p>The second point is the geographical basis of the representation they want to give the people in the central Parliament.</p>

<p>Yes! We know that the United Party said from the first day: &#x201C;There is also a geographical content in our policy of race federation&#x201D;. I am not arguing with the United Party about that. It is an old point in their policy, but the Progressive Party has now come to light with it for the first time. They say that they also have a geographical content in their policy now. Do you remember, Sir, how quite a quarrel developed between the <span class="col_1897-1898" refersTo="page_0962"/>hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Pinelands last week when the hon. member for Pinelands said by way of an interjection that their policy had always had a geographical content&#x003F; He was correct in saying this. Then the hon. member for Houghton challenged him. She said to him: &#x201C;It is not true. You do not know your own policy. Your policy has never had a geographical content.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Now she keeps on agreeing with me. Sir, the greatest irony and grotesqueness of the whole situation is that the Progressive Party&#x2019;s member here does not want the United Party to admit and reiterate that they have had a geographical content in their policy. She is now grabbing it for her party. For the first time she is now coming to light with the geographical concept for their policy. In doing so she is moving closer to the United Party, or the United Party is moving closer to her. I do not know how the polarization is working, but the two are moving closer to each other.</p>

<p>The third point of agreement between the political policies of these two concerns the provincial status which they accord to the Native areas. This is something the United Party has said previously as well. It is an old concept of theirs. We can refer far back in their documents to confirm this. It is even contained in this famous or notorious yellow booklet of theirs. But what does the Progressive Party say&#x003F; The Progressive Party has never told us this. They have always spoken of a communal voters&#x2019; roll with qualifications. Now they are imparting a geographical content to their policy and saying that the Bantu areas can attain the status of a province. These are the same words the United Party used long before she did. I do not know why she is still remaining outside the context of the United Party. I think the United Party should open their doors. They should leave a back door open so that the hon. member for Houghton may enter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, it is superficial childishness to say that she is seeking contact with us. The only common element is that all now admit that there is such a reality as Bantu homelands. Politically, however, they want to develop those areas quite differently from the way we want to do so. My point is that, politically speaking, those two parties of the Opposition want to develop those areas similarly. [Interjections.] We need no longer quarrel about the provincial status of those areas. It has been clearly established. The Progressive Party is now also in favour of a provincial status for the Bantu areas. In that regard they will have to do some more explaining.</p>

<p>Now we come to the fourth point of agreement between those two parties. It has been clearly expressed by leading persons on both sides. In this regard I am going to mention something in respect of the United Party which has been mentioned very seldom. If the leading member of theirs who did in fact say this, spoke out of turn, I should like this to be authoritatively denied and rectified in this House. I am going to quote what he said.</p>

<p>The Progressive Party says, and said so explicitly the other day, that when a Bantu area, a homeland, obtains independence, they will invite it to join the federal scheme. When we spoke to the hon. member for Houghton here by way of interjections, she said that Swaziland would also be given the opportunity of joining their federal scheme. This is their other point of agreement with United Party. I say this because last year, in April, 1970, the hon. Senator Horak, who is the chief secretary of the United Party, said that he foresaw the day, under a United Party Government, when representatives of Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland would sit in the federal parliament which his party planned for South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member must not jump on Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s back with such a false argument. Dr. Verwoerd never said that a Bantu homeland could join us before or after its independence or that a former protectorate could enter this Central Parliament before or after its independence. What we have in fact said and what Dr. Verwoerd did in fact say, <span class="col_1899-1900" refersTo="page_0963"/>is that we were sorry that the course of history in South Africa led to the establishment of a separate Swaziland, a Besutoland and a Bechuanaland with remnants of those nations in the Republic, because this should never have happened in 1910. This we have in fact said. In other words, those protectorates could have continued to exist on a united political basis with their brothers who are living in our country. However, Dr. Verwoerd never said what the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. Senator Horak have said, namely that they are prepared to invite the three independent countries to join the race federation under the race federation scheme of the United Party and the Progressive Party. The purpose of that is simply to increase the preponderance of Black nations over the White nation in this Parliament. I wonder where the Western civilization comes in about which the hon. member for Mooi River made such a fuss a few moments ago.</p>

<p>In a certain sense, only in a limited sense, because I am honest and scientific towards those two parties, here is a fifth point of agreement between them, and that is in respect of the voters&#x2019; roll. We know that the hon. member for Houghton is in favour of a voters&#x2019; roll with qualified franchise rights. They have not yet outlined very clearly what their qualifications will be.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, for allowing the hon. member to make that interjection. She said explicitly that they would be on an educational basis and on the basis of economic considerations. We know that hon. members of the United Party and the Party itself have already hinted in a very suggestive way at qualifications for franchise rights for the Bantu. I shall quote from the famous yellow brochure of the United Party. I refer to page 10 of the English copy, where the following appears in a neat black frame:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Marais Steyn, M.P., has defined race federation in one sentence. He said: &#x201C;Race federation is a system of government primarily designed for a multiracial state under which the power of self-government devolves on each race in those matters which intimately concern itself, while a central Parliament retains control over matters of overriding common concern.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now we must listen to the following words:</p>

<block name="quote">Each race is represented in the central Parliament in accordance with that state of civilization it has reached, so that the most advanced groups will retain political power, although sharing it with the less advanced.</block>

<p>But this is not all. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself said things such as these. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said: &#x201C;Everyone need not have the same say&#x201D;&#x2014;these are merely the various nations&#x2014;&#x201C;it need not be according to the same criterion &#x2026;&#x201D; Therefore they need not have the same qualifications for the franchise. He went further and said: &#x201C;There may be different criteria, depending on the stage of civilization which each race group has reached. Later we can decide again about all these problems.&#x201D; I also want to read to this House from a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 22nd January, 1962. This is old information, but this is what the United Party initially thought. This is a very interesting report and I hope I shall have enough time to deal with it properly. The report reads as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Marais Steyn, the United Party M.P. for Yeoville, said this afternoon that representation in the Lower House under his Party&#x2019;s race federation plan could be related to the different groups&#x2019; contributions to the national income or to the tax paid by each group.</block>

<p>Here we have the economic considerations spoken of by the hon. member for Houghton which she confirmed again this afternoon.</p>

And there is another little political tomcat following upon this one now. Hon. members on the other side must listen now. According to this newspaper, the hon. member for Yeoville said this, &#x201C;speaking at a meeting of the Luncheon Club in Cape Town&#x201D;. He added: &#x201C;Mr. Marais Steyn said representation in the Lower House should be based on the standard of living attained by the different groups &#x2026;&#x201D; Once again a qualified franchise is suggested. When he had finished speaking, the newspaper reported, &#x201C;Mr. Steyn was thanked by the Western Cape Chairman of the Progressive Party, Mr. Colin Eglin&#x201D;. Mr. Eglin is the present leader of the Progressive Party. This matter of the voters&#x2019; roll, with or without qualifications, is something which has roots going far back into the past. The Progressive Party knows about it, and their present leader knows about it. I have now mentioned five points on which there is great agreement. On the point I have just mentioned, there is limited agreement. The difference lies in the fact that while the Progressive Party states that there should be a common voters&#x2019; roll with qualifications, the United Party states that there should be a separate voters&#x2019; roll for the Bantu. Is what they want to introduce here not in itself a qualification based on colour&#x003F; What else is it based on&#x003F; While we are considering these most fundamental matters, the political development of the Bantu nations and their homelands, I want us to realize that the difference which we perhaps imagined existed between the Progressive Party and the United Party is disappearing. The two parties are moving towards each other. Who runs the fastest and who is going to run the farthest in order to reach the other group, we will still have to see.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I am always way out in front. In the limited time at my disposal I want to say a few words about the speech of the hon. member for Transkei. The hon. member said that the Natives&#x2019; authorities that do not accept or have not accepted our political system of Bantu authorities, have undergone no development in the past. The hon. member went so far as to mention the Zulus as an example of this. I think it was a completely untrue argument which the hon. member ferreted out. Statements such as these by the hon. member only contribute towards creating ill-feeling among such a Bantu people towards the government of the country. The facts prove that years before the Zulu people ever received a territorial authority, or even accepted regional authorities as the basis of territorial authorities, there was a great deal of development in their Bantu areas as a result of expenditure and undertakings by this Government. Towns were laid out there. They received agricultural expansion, an agricultural school, a school for chiefs and a university. I am only mentioning a few small things here. I can give hon. members some statistics. I shall go back as far as 1960. I want to say to you, Sir, that the gross fixed investment in Zululand increased from R1 million in 1960 to almost R20 million in 1966. Then, for reasons which we can explain very well, it dropped again, to approximately R10 million in the financial year which ended in 1968. It was only in that one homeland where the annual investments in money increased so tremendously. In the financial year 1967-&#x2019;68 alone, almost R5 million was spent only on Bantu towns. R1.3 million was spent on land purchases.</p>

<p>Furthermore, agricultural, educational and other development projects were undertaken in Zululand. This all happened before that people accepted a territorial authority and even before they accepted a number of regional authorities worth mentioning. How dare the hon. member put forward an untrue and inflammatory argument such as that in this House&#x003F; The same applies to other Bantu nations. [Interjection.] The hon. member shouts, &#x201C;how many jobs&#x201D;&#x003F; Last week I said in this Chamber that of the seven Bantu nations who already have territorial authorities, four have more than 50 per cent of their population permanently in their homelands. The Zulus are one of them. [Interjections.] Hon. members of the Opposition are like that proverbial hot stone&#x2014;you can rub fat on it as many times as you wish, it will not stick. The same happens to the facts we present to them.</p>

<p>In addition, the hon. member for Transkei said that the legislative assemblies and the various Bantu nations would not even know what the legislative assemblies and executive councils which they will receive in terms of this Act would look like.</p>

Do you know what, Sir&#x003F; Those people already know in essence, almost completely, what their legislative assemblies and their executive councils look like, because they already have them. If the hon. member had studied the Bill properly, he would have seen that the legislative assemblies and the executive councils which those Bantu peoples already have under the scheme which we call the activated scheme, can be recognized just like that in the new system which they can get in terms of chapter 1 and chapter 2 of this Bill.

<heading>WATER RESEARCH BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading resumed)</summary>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate was adjourned last week we were discussing the necessity for a water research commission, for which this Bill is making provision. We have a mass of research bodies in the country; more and more are <span class="col_1905-1906" refersTo="page_0966"/>being established and more research is being done, but the regrettable thing is that we have not had a statutory body in connection with water research long ago, because water is one of the most important elements in the country that we have to conserve. Sir, this country is rich in metals, minerals and raw materials, but it is poor in water. May I just say in passing that I have noticed that in this Bill reference is made to the &#x201C;oogmerke&#x201D; of the commission instead of &#x201C;doelstellings&#x201D;. This is a small point, but I should like to call the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to it. Reference is normally made to the &#x201C;objects&#x201D; (doelstellings) of a council and not the &#x201C;oogmerke&#x201D; of a council. But so much for that.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to the objects of a water research commission. In clause 2 (3) (a) quite a number of objects of the commission are mentioned, and I should firstly like to deal with the question of &#x201C;supply&#x201D;. Sir, the provision of water in this country is probably one of the most important of all the objects mentioned here. We simply have a country that has a high range of mountains to the east, all the way down the borders, and that is where the precipitation largely takes place, and where it will always take place. There is nothing extraordinary in this; one finds precisely the same thing in Australia. With this high degree of precipitation in the eastern mountain range, along the Drakensberg and the Amatola mountains, more than half of that water flows into foreign areas; it flows into the Bantu areas, across short distances down to the east coast. The question of the provision of water is still the most important subject we can talk about in this country. I want to say that water reclamation and the desalination of sea water are both methods for supplementing water supplies, but all these things involve extensive problems. In the purification and the reclamation of water there is an effluent that result in extensive problems. In the desalination of sea water it is even worse. If one considers the history of the countries that went in for the desalination of sea water on a large scale, one finds that they build up a mountainous supply of by-products that they do not know what to do with. One is not allowed to throw it back into the sea and one is not allowed to keep it on land, because all the salts are detrimental to the soil. The desalination of sea water results in extensive problems. It is fitting for a water research commission to delve into all the methods for the provision of water, but the most important aspect is still the water supplies that one has at one&#x2019;s disposal. That is why it is so important, before it is too late, for us to examine the quantity of water the country can provide for itself from the run-offs of the Drakensberg mountains and from the other mountain ranges where there is a high rainfall.</p>

<p>I almost want to predict that if we already had a method for pumping water back from the eastern water shed to the western, the Vaal Dam would already have been full at this stage instead of containing the percentage it now does as a result of the fact that so much water now runs off to the sea. This water has now been running off for several months, and will continue to do so for many more months, and this is water that we do not dam up and use. That is why it is so important for the provision of water to be one of the primary objects of a water research commission.</p>

<p>I want to go further in this connection. We have neighbouring territories, Lesotho and Botswana, and up to now we still know very little of the negotiations in connections with the Oxbow scheme. I think it is high time that the hon. the Minister explains things to us and tells us how far these negotiations have progressed in connection with the Oxbow scheme. Can we expect something from it in the future or not&#x003F; Because it is important for us to know this.</p>

<p>I want to come back and say that the most important water shed we have, the most important water area we have, is from the northern tip of the Drakensberg down to the Amatola. As I said previously, I think the primary object ought to be the provision of water. But now I come to the distribution of water, which is also one of the objects of the research commission, and the distribution and allocation of water to the urban areas, industry and agriculture are amongst the most important things we are dealing with. I do not want to say that there is correct allocation at this stage. Neither do I want to say that the water research commission will manage to establish methods whereby the correct allocation can be achieved in the future. I know that agriculture now uses a very great deal of the water we have at our disposal. How much will be necessary in the future to provide for the large urban and industrial <span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0967"/>complexes that are being built up remains a horse of another colour.</p>

<p>Then I want to speak about the pollution of water. We all know what a burning question the pollution of water is. The Usutu River does not fall within our territory; it lies in Swaziland, but when I read of what happened there when the water sources were polluted, so much so that helicopters had to be used to patrol the banks of the river warning farmers and everyone that even their livestock should not drink there, one can realize what dangers are involved in pollution. Sir, everyone probably read in the newspapers about what went on recently in East London. I do not want to choose sides there, and I do not want to say who was right, and which of the experts who were used there was correct, but if the pollution of the bathing spots and the sea water becomes so much worse that it becomes dangerous for the people to swim there, then pollution is a terribly serious question. We have spoken so many times of the effluent from factories, and of the necessity of purifying water before it is allowed to return to our streams, but what must happen to the water that comes out of the earth, and to what extent that water can be polluted we do not know. Pollution is an international problem, and a tremendous amount of research has been done throughout the world as far as our air and water is concerned, but I think that water pollution is one of the primary problems we have in this country, a problem that can assume such proportions in the future that it actually has a detrimental effect on the provision of our water supplies. One does not want to speak about certain rivers that are exposed to dangers. It is not necessary to mention this. The Minister will know about it.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to another aspect, the necessity for the results of research to be distributed to the public and to us all. This is one of the big problems we always have with research. It does not matter whether it is scientific research, agricultural research of whatever kind of research it may be, but the results of that research, for some or other reason, always get caught up in a bottleneck and never reach the public. I want to make a very strong recommendation to the Minister that it should be regarded as one of the most important objects of such a research commission that the results obtained be published from time to time and be given to the consumer public and the public in general so that they know where they stand in connection with the functions of such a research commission.</p>

<p>In addition there is just one small point that we can deal with in the Committee Stage. Under clause 4 (2) the members of the commission are appointed for a period which is determined by the State President. I should like to know from the Minister, since it is the usual procedure in the establishment of a statutory council or a statutory commission for the period of service of the members to be predetermined at three years or five years, why the State President is being allowed, in this particular case, to determine the period for which he may appoint a member. After all, he can get rid of him if he wants to. To me this is such a strange phenomenon in the establishment of a statutory council.</p>

<p>We are very grateful to have this Bill before this hon. House today. And it very seldom happens that there is so much agreement in this House about a Bill and about its importance and the necessity for having it. There are two salient points in this Bill. The one is the establishment of a statutory research commission for water affairs, and the second is the way in which the commission must obtain its funds. It is necessary, and I think it is important, for such a statutory commission to be assured of funds. I think that with this Bill it was an absolutely correct decision on the part of the Minister to even set out a scheme in the Act about how the commission will obtain its funds. I consider it important that the Minister indicated in this Bill that these funds would be obtained on as broad a level as possible; in other words, that all levels of the population would make a contribution to the funds of this statutory water research commission. I think it is important because it would thereby be possible for this water research commission to obtain as much funds as possible, because we know that research is expensive. But there is also another very important point, i.e. that no one&#x2014;and I repeat no one&#x2014; can be taxed by this trifling water levy to such an extent that they would even be aware of it, whether they be city dwellers, farmers or industrialists. I think it is important, and I think that by the application of this principle there ought to be sufficient funds coming in to provide for research needs. You know, the problem with our <span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0968"/>people at large is simply that as soon as one touches their pockets there is trouble. A further aspect of this Bill is the importance of the research that has to be done. There are quite a number of matters on which research is done and about which one could speak for hours. The hon. the Minister mentioned a whole series of them, for example the conservation of water, subterranean water, the best utilization for irrigation purposes, desalination, weather forecasting and the relationship between industrial water and water for agriculture. These are all fields which were somewhat neglected up to a few years ago. For example, I am now thinking of the reclamation of water, water pollution and now also the desalination of water.</p>

<p>Another subject that I personally find tremendously interesting is that in connection with subterranean water research. Why should this particular field interest me&#x003F; It interests me because when one thinks matter-of-factly about it, one comes to realize that one-fifteenth to one-twentieth of the water falling on South African soil flows away in the rivers. With a tremendous damming-up programme one can store about 50 per cent of all the run-off water in dams. When one thinks of this, one comes to realize that it constitutes only a small portion of the water falling on the surface. The surface water and the subterranean water therefore go to make up the water on which we all have to live. The surface water supplies 100 per cent of the livestock, 100 per cent of the maize production, almost 90 per cent of wheat cultivation and 75 per cent of the potato cultivation. That is why the surface water, the protection of the soil and subterranean water are of special importance. It is therefore a privilege for me to be able to say that at the request of the hon. the Minister the University of the Free State has already begun with a course in geo-hydrology. This is an altogether new field in the sphere of scientific investigation in South Africa, and it is of particular importance. The Geo-hydrology Department of the University of the Free State is particularly suited to carry out this research. There is no doubt about that. This department is headed by an outstanding scientist, Prof. Botha. At this stage he has no fewer than 30 post-graduate students in geology in his department. This makes the department one of the biggest departments in geology and geological research in the entire Republic. But there is one small matter that makes one a little gloomy. After the establishment of the Geo-hydrology Department, one first-year student enrolled for the course this year. If one thinks of the importance of this particular task, one feels a heaviness of heart at the fact that only one student enrolled. However, this does not cause one concern because all undertakings do begin on a small scale and are only extended in the course of time. But one does feel, nevertheless, that another plan should be made to encourage this. To be sure, in the course of the year Prof. Botha will probably pay a visit to overseas countries such as France, England and the U.S.A. in order to do research and to investigate this particular field of study, so that we do not have to begin from scratch but can make use of all the experience that already exists. But to first train one first-year student indicates to one that this particular field will furnish many problems and that it will take a very long time before it has come into its stride. One wonders whether the proper course, under the guidance of this water research commission, would not be to establish institutes at our various universities. Thus an institute for geo-hydrology could be established at Bloemfontein. Such an institute could then immediately co-opt people from outside and bring together a whole team of scientists to form a complete institute, which could then be used, like other institutes existing at our universities, to make a particular study of this subject under the guidance and co-ordination of the water research commission. I advocate institutes at the universities because actually an outside body cannot very easily commission a university to carry out certain research. They can be asked to do so, but as soon as one has an institute one is dealing with a board of control for that institute. I imagine that the water research commission can eventually appoint the effective section of the board of control of this institute, thereby to promote this research. This only applies to one field of research that must be undertaken. This indicates to us the mass of research awaiting us. It indicates to us how extremely important this particular Bill is for the future of South Africa and all its people. We are grateful for the fact that this Bill is before the hon. House today and that it enjoys so much support from both sides of the House.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members on this side have already indicated that we are supporting this Bill. Indeed, <span class="col_1911-1912" refersTo="page_0969"/>in the past there has been a request from all sides of the House for further facilities and further scientific investigation and research into so many water problems that, as the hon. member has said, it is no wonder that there is such a unanimous approval and support for this measure. Therefore I do not intend to keep the House for very long.</p>

<p>There are one or two points I would like to raise at this juncture. We on this side view the Water Research Commission as a body which will provide the scientific evidence for the department to be what we have in the past called the enforcement agency of the law. The hon. the Minister will remember two or three years ago, when we were dealing with this question of the enforcement agency, as we call it, that he said his department would enforce the law itself. It would be the enforcement agency. This goes back right to 1956, I think it was, when the present Water Act was before a Select Committee. Some of us on that Select Committee sought to have incorporated in the Act what we then termed &#x201C;the enforcement agency&#x201D;. We likened it to the circumstances at the present time under the Public Health Act, where private persons who feel that there is a threat to public health associated with their own community in some way or another, can lodge a complaint with the Department of Public Health. The whole machinery of the State and the Act itself is so geared that a complaint in regard to public health conditions goes forward to the appropriate authorities. The complainants in the case, the civil people concerned with the matter, drop out and the Department of Public Health takes over. Whether it is in a rural area or in an area under the control of a local authority, as the case may be, there is a properly constituted authority to carry on with the investigation and, if necessary, to initiate a prosecution, to get the evidence which will stand up in a court of law and, if the prosecution succeeds, to punish anybody who may be guilty of breaching public health laws and running the risk of creating disease in any particular place in the Republic. It was along that pattern that we sought in the Water Bill as it was at the time, to have an enforcement agency. You get the individual farmer who has to visualize the problems which arise if water which he gets for domestic purposes or for irrigation or for any other purpose connected with his business, is polluted. He has to take steps, not only to see that he suffers no damage or gets recompense for any damage that he may suffer, but that the person or the body who is responsible for the pollution is, if necessary prosecuted, taken to court and punished and that a repetition of that condition is avoided in the future. Where the ordinary farmer is concerned, it is virtually an impossibility. My hon. friend reminds me&#x2014;and I make a very strong point of that&#x2014;that prosecutions fail repeatedly because the technical and scientific evidence is not available before the court. It is no light matter even for companies in the agricultural community to obtain the professional people of proper standing who are capable of handling the scientific techniques which will give them the evidence which is necessary to stand up in a court of law. It is very difficult indeed. The people who are capable of doing that are few and far between.</p>

<p>This is the problem that we have had all the way through since the Act was first put on the Statute Book, namely of getting an enforcement body that would take that responsibility out of the hands of the private individual and in the interest of the country at large, would take all the necessary steps to get the scientific evidence, if necessary, initiate a prosecution and get the necessary technical and professional evidence. We look upon this body as a body that will get that evidence. We hope we are right that that is the body envisaged in this Bill. For that reason we agree to the levy for the research fund. It is not a principle which we would normally view with a very great measure of favour. We would look to the State to provide the funds for this kind of research in ordinary circumstances. But here the truth of the matter is that we feel that justice is being done by having a fund coming from such a source as that envisaged in the Bill, for the purpose of this research which the council will undertake.</p>

<p>The kind of problem that we are up against is this case that we now have in regard to the Usutu River. I want to mention this to the hon. the Minister, because we will be coming back to it at a later stage. It has already been mentioned by one or two of the members. Two members at least have said that this is a Swaziland river. It is not a Swaziland river. It has most of its sources outside our boundaries but it is a river which is an international boundary between us and the Portuguese territory to the north of us.</p>

<p>The mishap unfortunately occurred in Swaziland.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the point I am coming to. However, it is not a Swaziland river. The mishap occurred in Swaziland. But what flows from that&#x003F; The mishap occurred in Swaziland but the water which we are using and which we are entitled to use here in the Republic, our share of the water of the Great Usutu River, is not so polluted that the fish are lying dead in not hundreds, but thousands along the bank of the Usutu. I do not know what the papers down here have said about it, but I have just come down from there.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river, which is an international boundary, is the Portuguese territory. There there are scores of White settlers who are drawing their water from that river. There are also Bantu on our side of the river and Bantu on the Portuguese side of the river who are drawing from that water. When the river takes the turn at the international boundary, at the MacMahon Award line, and turns north, it becomes a purely Portuguese river. The Portuguese control both banks.</p>

<p>Now look at it from our point of view for a moment. Just at the Ndumu Game Reserve, the Pongola River runs into the Usutu. Because of the flat terrain, this age-old flat plain where the Usutu and the Pongola Rivers meet each other, if the Usutu is coming down in flood while the Pongola is running low, the water of the Usutu turns up the Pongola and it runs for at least 14 miles up the Pongola on a very flat level plain. It can come down up to two feet deep and it will travel for 14 miles up the Pongola if the position is, as it is particularly at this moment, with the building of the J. G. Strydom Dam when the Pongola is either not flowing at all or is very low-flowing. On the other hand if the Usutu is very low and the Pongola comes down in flood, the Pongola goes into the Usutu. It can travel into the Usutu and up the Usutu River and back into one of its old mouths that was created many years ago. In other words, the Pongola has two points of flowing into the Usutu. If the Usutu comes down in flood the flood water can come in at both those points and right up into the Pongola. On the other hand, if the Pongola comes down in flood there is a natural tendency for it to keep to the lower level. Then it will travel up the Usutu and then back again up its old water course. When the polluted water came down the Usutu, the Department of Water Affairs released a flash flood from the J. G. Strydom Dam. We are very grateful for that.</p>

<p>6,000 cusecs.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says it was about 6,000 cusecs. I understood that was so. Without having refrained from letting in that water and then having a look to see what was going to happen, it is impossible to say just what that 6,000 cusecs has saved us from. It is, however, abundantly clear that it has saved us from a disaster in the Ndumu Reserve and in those areas of the plains of the Pongola River. Those pans or plains are filled by the overflow and the flood-flow from the Pongola. Had that flash flood not been released from the J. G. Streydom Dam by the department, it could well have been the case that the water coming down the Usutu would have backed up the Pongola, filled all the pans in the Ndumu Game Reserve and all the pans which provide fish for the Tonga people on the plains on the Pongola for quite a distance up the river towards the J. G. Strydom Dam. We have been saved this because, firstly there was the water in the J. G. Strydom Dam and secondly because the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department acted quickly, efficiently and effectively when they released those 6,000 cusecs so that it was able to rise at any rate as steeply as the water coming down in the Usutu and it succeeded in edging away the Usutu water from coming back into the Pongola and its several mouths.</p>

<p>What now of the damage which has been done&#x003F; Here we have three different states which are involved with this water. I hope we are going to learn a lesson in another connection altogether. I hope we are going to take the lesson to heart as to what can happen in some of our other big rivers and in regard to what we are doing to those rivers. Here the damage was done in Swaziland. Will there be any redress&#x003F; This is one reason why I ask the hon. the Minister whether attention has been given to this. What do we do under these circumstances&#x003F; It is an accident. As we know, in nature accidents are common. It is natural to have an accident. When I was a very young man, I was on my father&#x2019;s farm and I used to do a lot of fencing. Afterwards I was in the Army and then I did fencing again with barbed wire entanglements <span class="col_1915-1916" refersTo="page_0971"/>I found a natural law. Plenty of other people have suffered from it. I tried to find a little formula and I succeeded. I call it the law of &#x201C;the innate hostility of inanimate things&#x201D;. That is a natural law and a very strong one. This is a manifestation of it. This is what happens. You have an &#x201C;accident&#x201D; as we call it and water is polluted. South Africa suffers because of it and we could have suffered grievous harm. I do not know what the Portuguese Government is doing about it. I have seen the damage done there and they will most probably come into it. It might have happened on our side. I do not know whether some kind of negotiations have taken place or if it is contemplated to deal with matters of this kind. In a matter of this sort the problem of our rights in regard to these rivers which today form an international boundary or can form an international boundary or flow partly through another country and partly through our country or in future through a third country such as we have had in the Pongola River, is a matter we should look into.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of our coastal waters. I hope this body proposed in the Bill will be allowed to undertake the scientific research in this regard as well. A body concerned with our coastal waters has already been established. It also deals with the protection of our lagoons which go right up into our rivers in some cases. It will not stop on the beach. Pollution from our seas goes right up into our bays and semi-enclosed bays, into our lagoons and up into our rivers. Mr. Archibald, M.E.C., is the chairman of the body in Natal which is recognized by the Government. It is composed of representatives of all the various State departments and provisions and regulations dealing with these matters were set out in black and white, but they have failed. They do not seem to work. We are facing the conditions which were foreseen at the time when that committee was established, but the committee is not functioning. It lacks all kinds of resources for research and for dealing with the problem. I think this problem is so vast that it is beyond the wit of man to find the language to describe how vast the pollution of our seawater is. As I have said, this pollution is carrying on into our lagoons and up our rivers. It is therefore going right into the domain of the hon. the Minister. I want to ask again, what we are going to do in this regard&#x003F; The present machinery is inadequate, is falling down and, in any case, never had the necessary scientists and people who could do research work to help in this regard. Quite rightly the hon. the Minister has come before Parliament with this Bill. As we have said in regard to other Bills of this kind, I want to say that we are also completely behind him with this one. The hon. member who preceded me said that here we have a case where all sides of the House are completely unanimous in their support of the hon. the Minister in not only the setting up of this research but also in the providing of funds in the form of the levy that is proposed in this Bill. I hope that the hon. the Minister is going to be bold. This is a case where there is a vast responsibility resting on his shoulders. He no longer has to be worried about divided councils and one side continually saying &#x201C;Go&#x201D; and the other side saying &#x201C;Hold back&#x201D;. Here everybody is saying to him &#x201C;Go forward, and get this body created as soon as you can&#x201D;. Let us get on with the job of tackling these problems. Civilization, as they call it, is catching up with us and it may ruin us before we are able to grapple with the problems.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if one thinks of the fact that water is the world&#x2019;s and man&#x2019;s main artery, one can only be thankful to the hon. the Minister for having come along to this House with such a Bill. Even more so, one can only be thankful for such unanimity on the part of both parties in this House, for their sober discussion and wholehearted support for this Bill. I have always refused, and always will refuse to be numbered among the people who from time to time lapse into a spirit of pessimism and fear that South Africa will, at some or other time in the distant future, perhaps go to meet its downfall as a result of a water shortage. I do not believe in that. It will not happen. Although we believe that South Africa&#x2019;s water sources are limited, I do not think that we have ever exploited their full potential. I think that for this reason the establishment of such a commission is very necessary and very timely. As I see it this commission will in future chiefly carry out its functions in four fields.</p>

<p>The first is by having unknown sources discovered and exploited, in other words subterranean sources that we are not yet aware of. In the second place well-known but unexploited sources can be exploited. Here I am thinking of numerous old mine-shafts in the Republic of South Africa, <span class="col_1917-1918" refersTo="page_0972"/> several of which are in my own constituency, Heidelberg, mineshafts that have never been used up to now and are storing millions and millions of gallons of pure water. In the third place I have in mind the reclamation and the purification of used water, which will have to take place to a large extent in future. Scientists claim that in a city like Johannesburg 85 per cent of the used water can be reclaimed. In the fourth place I think this commission will give its attention to the saving of water as used by human-beings, for domestic use and in irrigation, where flood irrigation can to a large extent be replaced by spray irrigation. To undertake these tasks a water research commission, as now envisaged, and a water research fund are necessary. Through research this commission will then be able to determine how many developed sources there still are and how and where reclamation and saving can take place. It is interesting to know that the area in which my constituency is situated, the Vaal triangle or the Witwatersrand area, drew the trekkers and the farmers to it 70 or 80 years ago as a result of its abundant supply of water. I quote (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Water was the natural resource that drew the Voortrekkers to the Witwatersrand. To the south of the Orange Grove quartzite ridge that formed the water shed, the positioning of the farms was determined by fountains and valleys in an area that was apparently an excellent sponge area. Most of the runoff reached the Vaal river by way of a series of side streams between Klip River in the west and the Suikerbosrand River in the east. Farms derived their names from the abundance of water, for example Kliprivieroog, Olifantsvlei, Vierfontein, Turffontein, Horingfontein, Elandsfontein, Braamfontein, Waterval, Rietfontein and Palmietfontein.</block>

<p>It is interesting to know that although people moved there as a result of the area&#x2019;s abundance of water, the present picture is just the reverse. That area has developed to such an extent that it demands more and more water. There we find some of the greatest water needs in the Republic of South Africa. In 1966, for example, the 1.36 million people in greater Johannesburg used 78 million gallons of water per day. 60 million gallons of this reached the sewerage works. A Johannesburg City Council expert then calculated that by the year 2,000 there would be an enormous increase in both the population and in the run-off in the drains of their houses and places of work. In the year 2,000 more than 3 million people will use 250 million gallons daily, and at least 85 per cent of this water will be available for re-use. We therefore see that this proposed commission will be of inestimable value to the Witwatersrand and the Vaal triangle area, where water will be more and more urgently needed now and in the future. Those of us from that area are grateful that this water research commission is going to be appointed, and also that a water research fund is going to be established. We know that it will often have to turn its steps and its attention to the Witwatersrand where this is so necessary We wish this to-be-established commission and fund all prosperity and success; we welcome them; we need their attention in the Witwatersrand and in the Vaal triangle area.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful for the fact that both sides of the House are agreed in connection with this legislation before us. In fact, since I have been in this House of Assembly, I cannot remember us ever having a single stormy debate here in which we differed about water affairs. Not only the fact that hon. members on both sides of the House accepted the Bill in this spirit, but also the arguments with which they came to light, are an indication that a situation has already developed in South Africa that makes it extremely necessary for us to have a body such as this at our disposal. Sir, one could ask why we are specifically coming forward with this Bill at this stage, and why we did not do so previously. The reason for the establishment of such a commission specifically at this stage is that recently we have witnessed very extensive developments in South Africa as far as the chemical industry is concerned. We must remember that as man creates more complex processes it becomes increasingly difficult to control the effluents of these processes, particularly in respect of the pollution that results. That is why it was necessary, at some time or other, for us in this country to come forward with such a commission which will have the authority that this commission will have, and that will also obtain the funds that this commission will obtain. After we have looked at what is happening in the rest of the world, it is very clear to me that this step in South Africa is one that is actually <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0973"/>placing our country in the forefront; as I said on a previous occasion, other countries of the world have apparently not yet been so forcibly impressed by the scarcity of water and the necessity in particular of stopping pollution, as we in South Africa have been compelled to do because our sources are naturally smaller than the water sources that many other countries have at their disposal. We therefore had to be quicker in submitting such legislation than other countries that have already passed such legislation or still have to do so. I think that the attention which the matter will have to receive in the rest of the world will increase, and I also believe that South Africa&#x2019;s example will be followed in the future.</p>

<p>&#x2020;The hon. member for Mooi River, in supporting this Bill referred to the important part that pollution plays in a situation as we have it today. The hon. member urged that we should focus attention upon the whole question of pollution. Of course, we are doing so and that is what the Bill is there for. The incidence of pollution in South Africa is responsible for the fact that we have come forward with this Bill at this juncture.</p>

<p>The hon. member also dealt with what he called environmental destruction. I think when the Vote &#x201C;Water Affairs&#x201D; comes under discussion, we will have an opportunity to discuss all aspects of pollution and the destruction of the environment. I do not think that we should discuss these matters at greater length in this debate. The hon. member also referred to the question of desalination. May I tell the hon. member that not only do we have extensive research done in South Africa on the question of desalination but that we also have a very beneficial relationship with other countries in the world. We are not out of date. As a matter of fact, on many aspects we are working together with countries of Europe and America.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Piketberg made the remark that we cannot expect other people to solve our problems for us. That is so, and that is specifically why South Africa, with its particular geographic situation and its particular problems, must look in the first place to the capabilities of its own people for solving those problems. There are many aspects in which South Africa, situated as it is, cannot look to other countries for the solution of its problems. In fact, we think the day will come when other countries will come to South Africa to see what we are doing in this connection. I want to remind the hon. member that it was not other countries, but South Africa that made the breakthrough in connection with the big problem of water reclamation. There is already enormous interest in it abroad. Many countries are coming forward and asking us whether they can have a look at what we are doing here and they are asking whether we can make information available to them.</p>

<p>Sir, I notice that the hon. member for Orange Grove is not here at the moment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City made a remark here which led me to suspect that he is under the impression&#x2014;I do not want us to misunderstand each other; I know he means it well&#x2014;that we are going to get assistance from the commission in connection with our big construction projects and our planning. I want to tell the hon. member that I see the work of the commission in a slightly different light. I think the needs are also a little different. We feel that the commission must specifically be there to co-ordinate the activities of existing bodies particularly the private sector and the universities, as well as the activities of the Department of Water Affairs and the C.S.I.R., with special reference to basic and applied research. But it is not our intention that the commission should eventually take over the broad planning and functions of the Department of Water Affairs. We do not think that the constitution of the commission is such that it would be able to do so. In other words, we shall try to confine the activities of the commission to those spheres where the Department cannot easily extend its activities, because it does not always have the technical staff available and because it cannot always attempt to gauge the basic problem in depth to the extent in which a commission, with the help of universities and institutes, is able to do so. I think we can supplement each other. I do not think that we shall contemplate calling upon the commission, or even calling upon its assistance, except when it comes to construction work involving basic problems such as landslides, the hardness of rock and the kind of problems requiring special research before the Department can continue with its work. The hon. member also referred to pollution disasters. In that connection I just want to link up with what the hon. <span class="col_1921-1922" refersTo="page_0974"/>member for South Coast mentioned here. It is a pity that what happened a few days ago in a neighbouring state, where a retaining wall at a factory broke releasing extremely poisonous effluent, had to happen. As hon. members know, the effluent from a pulp factory is the most dangerous of industrial effluents. The Department sent some of its best engineers overseas for months at a stretch to get abreast of the latest research and to gain the latest knowledge in that connection. We know that a great deal is being done in other countries, because the effluent from the factory, the black concentrate, the chemicals that are used to break down the fibre and that cannot be reclaimed, are extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>Where it is poured out very far into the sea it can also be dangerous because even in the sea although it is greatly diluted, it remains a dangerous substance. In South Africa we are trying to get rid of it in another way; we are trying to evaporate the water in it, but it still remains dangerous because in such an evaporation process it infiltrates the soil, and now or in the future it can break through somewhere and destroy the entire region. What happened here was that the pulp factory in Lesotho built an evaporation dam because the factory was not near the sea. They did good work, but the dam broke as a result of rains and the poisonous water ran out and was en route to the confluence of the Pongola. Fortunately the Department of Water Affairs quickly discovered what was happening; otherwise there would have been a great deal of damage as a result of these poisonous substances. Fortunately we had enough water in the Strydom Dam, and the best we could then do was to release all the large quantity of the water in the Strydom Dam to carry the poisonous substances along, washing them to the sea as quickly as possible. Had that not happened, a great deal of damage would really have been done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast asked whether an agreement existed between the countries so that this sort of thing will not happen. We have a forum where we can talk to each other. The countries involved are those bordering on the same rivers, and we are on very good terms and hold regular meetings. The understanding that now exists between South Africa, Swaziland and the Portuguese territories, and also with Botswana and Rhodesia, is better than it was at first, and we can therefore discuss this kind of problem with each other. I hope and trust that when we can come forward with more technical knowledge and therefore can offer direct assistance, we can make plans in connection with our common problems and that we shall then make further progress. That is why I think that here too South Africa, with the position it occupies in Southern Africa&#x2014;and I do not want to be misunderstood&#x2014;because we are in a position to possess advanced knowledge and do research can land up in a position of leadership in which we can really be of service to our neighbouring states. This is one of the fields in which we can, in fact, do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised a few other points, but time is getting short and I shall rather deal with them under the Vote. I also think that the hon. member himself will come back to subjects like St. Lucia under the Vote.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fauresmith referred to a very important development in the Orange Free State, and I am glad that he mentioned it here, i.e. that the University of the Orange Free State has decided to establish an Institute for Geo-hydro logy. We are glad that it is being established there, and we look forward to deriving a great deal of benefit from it. It is a young university with a vigorous Department of Geology and a clever head, Prof. Ben Botha. The university has come forward and decided to do this service for South Africa and to enter upon a new field that we must enter, i.e. a field concerned with a proper study of the whole subterranean water situation of South Africa. This is important, because you will understand that we shall have to fall back increasingly on our subterranean water position. Whether we want to know it or not the fact remains that in certain parts of South Africa there is a great deal of subterranean water available, but we must be able to determine the rate of replenishment and we must therefore be able to conclude from that what the rate of withdrawal must be. If not, we shall exceed that and undermine our subterranean water supplies. But while there are large subterranean water supplies available in certain areas, it is also a fact that we have already exceeded our supplies in large areas <span class="col_1923-1924" refersTo="page_0975"/>of the country. Now this is the kind of thing one does not have to be clever about and ask why one did not do this or that. You know the development of geo-hydrology is a fairly recent one. But the accumulation and extension of knowledge, especially in the leading countries, two of which are France and America was of such great use in recent times that today, with the latest methods, we can make much better determinations than at first. It is necessary for us to understand the subterranean water situation as soon as possible, and know as much about it as possible, because we cannot meet the future if we do not have that knowledge. That is why I am very grateful that the University of the Orange Free State is going to furnish this particular service. I also want to tell the hon. member that he need not be afraid of the fact that only one student enrolled this year. You know, they only decided a few weeks ago to begin with the institute, and I am glad that they had a student available immediately, and I believe that next year they will have quite a few more students, because this will help to prepare our country in this field as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heidelberg raised a very important point. I can understand that where he lives it is very important for him to know what the future of the Vaal Triangle sources will be. It is specifically in the Vaal Triangle that we must harness science very quickly, firstly to reclaim as much as we possibly can, and secondly to stop pollution, because that is where the chemical industry is developing on a large scale. It is so difficult for a country to meet the extensive development taking place in the Vaal Triangle at present if one is not sufficiently prepared for the immediate harnessing of science in order to prevent the results of industrial development catching one unawares, because it is specifically there that we do not have a great deal of water. That is why I want to tell the hon. member that we have already held discussions with the Rand Water Board and that in the future, in co-operation with the Rand Water Board and the Universities of the Witwatersrand and Pretoria we shall probably be launching considerable research programmes; and I must say that we shall need to make the necessary funds available very quickly in order to inject them immediately into the research projects in progress in the Vaal Triangle.</p>

<p>I think that these are the most important remarks that need to be made in respect of hon. members who took part in the debate. I am glad that we could accept the Bill with so much unanimity, and I look forward to the good work which this commission will do, and what this will mean for South Africa.</p>

<heading>WATER AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<summary>(Second Reading)</summary>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a Second Time,</block>

<p>As a result of the rapid increase in the demand for water and the resultant rapid progress in technology, new problems are continually cropping up, or new developments taking place.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that everything takes place in an orderly manner, it is of course necessary, <i>inter alia,</i> to exercise control and make provision for new developments and to facilitate and ensure the smooth functioning of administrative procedures in that regard, and this can best be done by stipulating it by way of legislation.</p>

<p>It has now become necessary to adjust the Water Act, and the easiest will be to discuss each clause and to explain the proposed amendments.</p>

<p>Clause 1:</p>

<p>Such good progress is at present being made with research and experiments in regard to the purification of municipal effluent, including sewage, that a process of purifying the effluent to a standard where the purified product will be suitable for human consumption has already been developed. A great deal of progress has already been made in the perfection of this process to make it economically practicable for local authorities. The time has therefore arrived to make the provisions of the Water Act, 1956 (Act No. 54 of 1956) applicable to reclamation works of this nature, and particularly in order to encourage local authorities, by means of subsidies, to undertake such works. To make <span class="col_1925-1926" refersTo="page_0976"/>that possible it is being proposed here that the definition of &#x201C;water work&#x201D; in section 1 of the Act, be amended to include reclamation works so that subsidies in terms of section 162 of the Act can be granted by the Minister of Water Affairs just as in the case of water supply schemes. In other words, it has become necessary to include this new development and its technology in the Act.</p>

<p>Clause 2:</p>

<p>A new phenomenon in the utilization of public water is the action taken by financially resourceful persons or groups of persons to build water works of great size on their own responsibility which has, or may have, a considerable effect on existing or future Government water works or on the rights of other riparian owners. Where major water works of this nature are built only by irrigation boards, water boards or other statutory bodies, as has been the case up to now, it is possible to control the use of water thus stored or abstracted, in terms of the prescription of the Water Act. However, where a water work is built by an individual or a non-statutory body it is not possible, in most cases, to do this without the aid of a Water Court or without proclaiming a Government water control area. To effect control by means of a Water Court is an extremely expensive, lengthy and often unpractical process, and to proclaim a Government water control area for the sole purpose of controlling one water work is obviously undesirable. To meet the new threat to the orderly functioning of the water economy of the country, it is being proposed in clause 2 of the Bill to bring the construction of all major water works in unproclaimed rivers under Government control.</p>

<p>Clause 3:</p>

<p>Attention has been drawn to practices which have originated for the intensive breeding and fattening of stock which constitute a real danger of the pollution of public streams. The extremely prejudicial consequences of this have already been experienced in America and it is deemed very necessary that steps be taken in time to prevent similar conditions in South Africa. The method which is being proposed, is the insertion of a section into the Water Act as indicated in clause 3 of the Bill. The intention here is to bring concentrations of any livestock for fattening purposes, just as in the case of industries, into the cadre of control undertakings. If pollution should result from that, the Minister would be able to apply the same control as that which obtains in the case of industries.</p>

<p>Clause 4:</p>

<p>The large-scale abstraction of subterranean water by gold mines from the dolomitic area on the West Rand, is leading to the depletion of surface and subterranean water resources which have for many years supplied water for irrigation purposes. The result is that the irrigation farmers in question are being compelled to seek a means of subsistence elsewhere, and consequently they must be compensated financially for the loss of a livelihood. However, there are no statutory provisions which compel the mine-owners to pay compensation, or according to which the amount of compensation can be arranged. In disputes which have thus far arisen, the Minister of Water Affairs has acted as mediator, but he is handicapped by a lack of jurisdiction. In clause 4 of the Bill steps are being suggested to supplement the deficiency.</p>

<p>Clause 5:</p>

<p>The present procedure whereby stipulations and conditions for the supply of water from Government water works for various purposes, excluding irrigation, is prescribed by regulation, places an unnecessary administrative burden on the Department, which can to a considerable degree be alleviated if it is possible to enable the Minister to lay down stipulations and conditions without having to promulgate regulations each time a water work is put into operation, or to amend the regulations whenever it is found necessary to do so.</p>

<p>Clause 6 (a), (c) and (d):</p>

<p>In terms of the provisions of sections 63 (8) (a), 63 (9) (a) and 63 (10) of the Act, land which is included in the schedule of irrigable surface areas of a Government water scheme is deleted from that schedule if&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) there is an increase in the number of owners of said land so that the <span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0977"/>land any one of the greater number of owners is entitled to irrigate is less than 20 morgen in extent; or</li>

<li>(b) any scheduled land owned in terms of a settlement law, is alienated or leased for a long period to a person who is already the owner or lessee of other scheduled land; or</li>

<li>(c) the owner of scheduled land obtains the water rights, without the said land, from another person; or</li>

<li>(d) a person who does not own scheduled land obtains the water rights from two or more persons, in other words, purchases it;</li>

</ol>

<p>unless the Minister on the recommendation of the Land Tenure Board otherwise directs. The intention of these provisions is to prevent the fragmentation of scheduled land into uneconomic units, or that any particular individual obtains an unreasonably great advantage from such a Government water work. The Act does, however, provide that in cases where this is justified on merit, the Minister of Water Affairs may make an exception. However, the Minister can only act &#x201C;on the recommendation of the Land Tenure Board&#x201D;. This means that if the said Board were to recommend that in any particular case an exception should in fact be made, the Minister may nevertheless, at his discretion, refuse. But if the Board, for reasons not acceptable to the Minister, should refuse to recommend that an exception be made, there is no matter before the Minister to decide. What it amounts to in practice is that the Minister may in the one case reject the Board&#x2019;s recommendation at his discretion while the Board in another case is in the position to undermine the Minister&#x2019;s authority. This is an anomaly which must be rectified, and consequently it is being proposed in clause 7 (a), (c) and (d) of the Bill that the said provisions be amended so that the Minister need only consult the Land Tenure Board, without in actual fact being bound by the Board&#x2019;s decision. The same principles already apply in sections 3, 12, 21 and 110 (b) of the Water Act for example, where discretionary powers are granted to the Minister, after consultation with other Ministers, the South African Bureau of Standards and the Public Service Commission.</p>

<p>Clause 6 (b):</p>

<p>All that is being proposed here, is the rectification of a printers error in the Afrikaans text of section 63 (8) (c) of the Act.</p>

<p>Clause 7 (a):</p>

<p>Section 66 of the Act empowers the Minister to assess rates on land which is irrigated with water from Government water works. The intention was of course to empower the Minister also to assess charges in respect of water which may be supplied for all other purposes. However, the phrasing of the section is not clear enough in this respect, and it is now being proposed to improve the phrasing.</p>

<p>Clauses 7 (b), 8 and 9:</p>

<p>In addition the provisions of section 66 of the Act empowers the Minister to recover outstanding charges and rates by causing steps to be taken in a court of law, and in addition to stop the supply of water to the land in question until such time as the outstanding amount has been collected. It is also provided that rates and charges assessed by the Minister or an Irrigation Board are a charge upon the land and that future owners remain responsible for them. Lastly it is provided that no transfer of land in respect of which a rate has been assessed may be effected in the deeds registry to the name of any other person unless a certificate has been submitted to the effect that all outstanding rates have been paid. The result of this is that the Registrar of Deeds has to endorse all the said deeds and registers. This does not only apply to all Government water schemes, but also to all irrigation districts. This arrangement places a tremendous burden of work on the staff of deeds registries, something which is not justified, taking into account the safeguard already contained in the Water Act. At the request of the Registrar of Deeds it is therefore recommended that section 66 (3) and 92 (3) (b) of the Water Act be deleted.</p>

<p>Clause 10:</p>

<p>In terms of section 123 (1) of the Act the financial year of a Water Board ends on 31st December of each year, and in terms of section 109 (8) a Water Board is required to convene a meeting during January of each <span class="col_1929-1930" refersTo="page_0978"/>year. It would be an advantage for a Board to deal with its annual statements during the compulsory annual meeting, but it is not always possible to have the annual statements ready in time after the termination of the financial year of 31st December. Consequently it is being proposed that the time for the compulsory annual meeting be changed to February in order to allow sufficient time for the preparation of annual statements.</p>

<p>Clause 11:</p>

<p>In section 121 (5) of the Act reference is made to moneys which the Minister may advance to a newly established Water Board until such time as a Board receives an income from the sale of water. However, it is also provided that no advance shall be made in respect of any waterworks the total cost of which will exceed R60,000 when completed, unless a report on the proposed works has been laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament and such advance had been approved by resolution of both such Houses. Similar provisions were previously contained in section 157, as regards loans to irrigation boards, but the section in question was amended during 1969 by increasing the amount to R150,000. The reason is that the construction costs of civil engineering works have increased tremendously since the promulgation of the Water Act in 1956. The result of this is that a far smaller work can be constructed at a cost of R60,000 today than was the case in 1956. For the same reason it is now being proposed to effect a similar amendment to section 121 (5).</p>

<p>Clause 12:</p>

<p>In terms of section 125 of the Water Act a water Board is required to establish and maintain a renewals fund in order to defray the costs of the renewal of its water works. However no fund need be maintained if the water works in question has a useful life of not less than the period of any loan raised in connection therewith. If these statutory provisions are applied strictly according to their literary meaning, a water board must therefore maintain another fund in order to make adequate provision for the complete replacement of a water works of which the expected useful life is perhaps a few years less than the period of the loan. In order to comply with this requirement, a board is then obliged to have the present uses pay for a water works which will in the distant future be available free of charge for the benefit of the future users. Such an arrangement places an unfairly heavy burden on the financers of a Board and results in the case of the Phalaborwa Water Board for example, that the tariffs for the provision of water having to be increased by 23 per cent. At present the said Board is temporarily exempted from the statutory requirements (in terms of the second proviso to section 125), but on the effluxion of the exemption period the Board will be required to increase the tariff by 23 per cent, which will make the price of water uneconomic. It is therefore being proposed in clause 12 of the Bill that the Minister be empowered to determine the scope of a renewals fund, taking into consideration the nature and probable life of a water works, as well as the amount and redemption period of any loan raised in connection therewith.</p>

<p>Clause 13:</p>

<p>As far as the increase of the amount of R60,000 to R150,000 is concerned, the same observations apply as under clause 11 of this Bill.</p>

<p>The Water Act was amended by Act No. 77 of 1969 by making certain additional control measures, as set out in section 95A, possible in cases where irrigation boards do not fulfil their obligations properly or where the takeover by the state of irrigation board schemes may be necessary for other reasons. The initial provisions of section 95 are, in terms of section 125, <i>mutatis mutandis</i> applicable to other boards or bodies with powers and duties similar to those of irrigation boards, such as settlement management boards, for example. Consequently the supplementary provisions of section 95A also had to be made applicable, in terms of Act 77 of 1969 to the latter boards and bodies. Through an oversight, however, this was not done and the necessary provision is now being made in clause 13 of the Bill.</p>

<p>Clause 14:</p>

<p>In section 166 of the Act provision is made for authorizing persons to enter upon private property for the purpose of complying with certain requirements of the Act. In practice it has been found that the purposes specified in the section are not sufficient, and consequently it is being proposed <span class="col_1931-1932" refersTo="page_0979"/>in clause 14 that persons may be authorized to enter upon private land in order to comply with any provision of the Act.</p>

<p>Clause 15:</p>

<p>The Department continually finds it necessary in the execution of its functions to enter upon the land of private persons.</p>

<p>During operations carried out on this land unavoidable damage to it may be caused. In this way, for example, a tree must sometimes be felled in order to enable a surveyor to make his surveys, or lands are damaged where a drilling rig has been set up to drill test holes, and so on. In such cases the owners are compensated for the damage thus caused. In the past such matters were submitted to the Treasury for the necessary approval to compensate for the damage. As has already been mentioned, the damage is unavoidable and is usually slight, and the Treasury was of the opinion that the section should be amended so that the Department itself may also decide on these matters in order by so doing to alleviate the burden of work.</p>

<p>As hon. members can see, it is being envisaged, with the changes in the existing measures and the new measures which are now before the House, to facilitate the smooth operation of activities and to make corrections. I do not think there is a single proposal in this Bill which has not at some stage or another been discussed on either side of the House. It is necessary to have better control over water matters in this country. That is why it is with pleasure that I move the Second Reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, let me say at once that we on this side of the House support the Bill which the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs has brought forward this afternoon. However, that is not to say that there will not be some debate in regard to some of the clauses in the Bill. There are some provisions of a very far-reaching nature incorporated in this Bill. I should like to touch upon two or three of them. I am grateful to the hon. the Minister for having dealt clause by clause with this measure. It is a Bill which does not deal with one big central principle which is then expanded in the other provisions of the Bill. Virtually every clause deals with some important point, but a point which is disassociated from the other points in the Bill. Each point could stand alone. It is not associated with or linked to a common purpose or some common principle with any of the other clauses in the Bill. The Bill itself is one which we have to expect. I want to add that this is not criticism of the department for the work which it is doing because we realize that it is short-handed and that it is very difficult to get trained people in that department. There is a growing realization of the fact that in water we have one of the most precious commodities which nature has bestowed upon us in this country; the whole public attitude towards water has changed completely over the last 30 or 40 years and possibly in the last 10 or 15 years, and even as late as the last two or three years. Water has taken on a degree of importance which can hardly be reconciled with the public attitude towards water of 30 or 40 years ago. Because the Act of 1956 is being administered by the department, with its difficulties in regard to staff, and so forth, we must anticipate year by year&#x2014;and this we do&#x2014;that the Minister will be forced to bring before this House a measure dealing with the problems and difficulties which the department has come across in its administration of the parent Act as it has been amended from time to time. That is inevitable now. The greater the emphasis on the value of water, the greater the pressure will be on the department to do something to ensure that the interest of the people who are beneficiaries are maintained. This interest grows in value year by year and when people have something of value and they think it is imperilled or in jeopardy, they turn to the authority which is responsible for the care of that particular interest. In this case the valuable commodity is water and the authority responsible for its care is the hon. the Minister. Should there be a shortfall in the protection that he has afforded to people who either have water or are afraid of losing some interest in water, as the case may be, or should that water become polluted and is therefore lost to the interested people in a sense, they will go to the hon. the Minister. Here again in this Bill, as in so many other Bills which deal with water, we have the question of pollution once again coming to the fore. Special provision is made here to deal with the question of pollution. This question of pollution runs continuously through the various Bills which we have dealt with.</p>

<p>Now that the hon. the Prime Minister is here I want to make a special appeal to him. Last year I made a similar appeal, but <span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0980"/>he did not see his way clear to agree with us on that occasion. However, he will come to our way of thinking eventually. The logic of circumstances will force him to do so. I want the hon. the Prime Minister to think about it and then to give us a Minister and a department which will be concerned with the protection of our environment. This will include all the measures which the hon. the Minister brings before us. The hon. the Minister is struggling against adversity in this matter. He is dealing with his portfolio and with the portfolio of Forestry which also entails the problem of pollution of the soil and pollution of the environment. This also carries with it the pollution of the environment because it deals with the pollution of water. In its various aspects, the Bill which has just been read a second time, deals with the question of research into the question of water wherever it may be and wherever it falls under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister and his department. This includes the underground water supplies, rain, rivers, lakes tidal rivers and so forth. All these aspects are involved in the problem of pollution. That is only one aspect of it. This hon. Minister has to grapple with this part of it, the pollution of our seawater, bays, semi-enclosed bays, river estuaries and rivers are the responsibility of another Minister altogether. The arrangements of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs in this regard has broken down. When it comes to air pollution and other pollutions of the environment neither the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs or the hon. the Minister of Water Affairs, nor the hon. the Minister of Forestry is concerned. Again it is the responsibility of another Minister altogether. Even the hon. the Minister of Health comes into the picture somewhere.</p>

<p>This is surely the wrong way to deal with a matter of such importance. Every facet of it is important. The pollution of our water can be fatal to invested capital, to the health of man and beast and agriculture. When one comes to the question of the pollution of the air, one realizes that it can be fatal to the health of the population. The pollution of soil is one of the biggest problems facing the more progressive countries of the world today. These countries are of the most advanced in agriculture and their biggest problem is the pollution of the soil. What flows from this kind of pollution&#x003F; From pollution of the soil you go to pollution of the waters because your flood and run water drain into your rivers and into your lakes. What does that do&#x003F; It kills your bird-life, animals and animalcule which we know are absolutely vital for the survival of the human race.</p>

<p>What do we know about the laws dealing with underground water&#x003F; Which of our scientists will stand up in public today and say that he is going to give a lecture about what is known about underground water and the laws that govern underground water&#x003F; In this Bill we have a clause, to which I will come in a minute, where the hon. the Minister defines the damages which can flow from certain aspects of the use of underground water. Does the hon. the Minister say that he can say with certainty that the scientists have told him what the laws are that are governing the underground water supplies here in the Republic and that therefore he is safe to assess damages&#x003F; Is he safe to say to a person that he is causing harm to certain other persons, that those farmers, those towns or industries are suffering and that he is responsible to the extent of RX,000 or RX million and that he is going to allot damages against him for doing that&#x003F; When damages are paid is the harm then cured&#x003F; Of course not. It is no good paying damages after the water has been polluted and after the damage is done. What we want to do is to prevent the damage.</p>

<p>I therefore want to appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister again that he has an hon. Minister that he can spare. I am not being personal now, but am only stating what I am sure he will agree with. It is a fact that he can spare one or two of his Ministers but what we can no longer spare in South Africa is a Minister who is going to be responsible for all those things which are polluting our environment, which are affecting the health, not only of the human population but of every living organism, including our vegetation. This Minister will then be the man to whom people who complain of pollution of this section of our environment or that section can turn because it is known that that is the Minister whose Department is in charge of all that. One will go to with certainty to the man who carries that responsibility and who has a Department who can deal with it. That is what is lacking today and I appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister to please help his own country by providing that Minister and that Department to see that our environment is no longer polluted. We are <span class="col_1935-1936" refersTo="page_0981"/>only at the beginning and surely we can learn the lesson of history from other countries. We can see what is happening at the present time in other countries.</p>

<p>At the present time in the United States there are 600 firms who are doing nothing but bottling pure spring water. Last year they increased their turnover by no less than 500 million dollars. They bottle pure spring water so that the person who drinks it is able to say that it is good fresh spring water. It has not been polluted, purified, reactivated, polluted again, reactivated and purified once more, eventually becoming a dead element which can be described in chemical terms, poured into your glass or, for those who have lemonade, which can be mixed with your lemonade. It is pure spring water, and the profit is sufficient for the existence of 600 firms in America providing it. That is how far they have gone. But they have gone that far because of the pollution of their main water supply. So it goes with all or most of the older and bigger countries of the world. We need not follow suit, but we are perilously near the time when we have to, whether we like it or not, take active steps. We are going to have, I should say, at least four or five various departments, each one trying to grapple with a segment of the problem, with no adequate co-ordination so that the picture can be seen as a whole and adequate steps taken to deal with it.</p>

<p>As to the Bill itself, I say we are supporting it. We think that the Minister must come with a Bill like this from time to time. I only want to deal with one or two clauses. As the Minister has said, under this Vote there will be other opportunities for debate. In regard to clause 2 we are at one with the Minister in suggesting that &#x201C;no person shall construct, alter or enlarge any water work in which more than 100 morgen feet of public water could be impounded or stored or by means of which more than ten cubic feet of water per second could be extracted or diverted from a public stream, except under the authority of a permit from the Minister &#x2026;&#x201D; We have heard the reason he has advanced for this clause. We agree with him. Where such works have already been constructed, there is nothing the Minister can do about it. They have been constructed legally and there they are. I would like to suggest that the Minister might consider calling&#x2014;even if he fixes a time; six months if he likes&#x2014; for a registration of existing works where that size of conservation dam has been constructed, or a dam which can give that amount of draw-off, namely 10 cubic feet a second, so that he has, at the date when he enforces this clause, a record of all the dams of that size already constructed. As time goes on and this clause is enforced against people who come to the Minister for a permit for the purpose of constructing, altering or enlarging existing dams of those dimensions, the Minister will have a record of those who have already completed that work which is legal, but for which a permit from the Minister has not been obtained in terms of this clause. When they constructed their dams this clause was not in operation. It is not being made retrospective. We do not ask for it to be made retrospective. But we believe that possibly a register of such existing dams would be advantageous.</p>

<p>Then I come to clause 4. This deals with the question of sub-terranean water and the powers which the hon. the Minister is now taking. It says that they&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; may include conditions regarding the payment by the owner concerned of compensation, calculated on a basis, or determined in a manner specified in such conditions, to any person who, in the opinion of the Minister, is or may be adversely affected by the removal from the mine concerned of the subterranean water.</block>

<p>When the hon. the Minister replies, could he perhaps give us some further information as to how he sees the quantum of the water being worked out, what the effect is likely to be and how he is going to assess the quantum of the damages to the people who are likely to suffer. You see, Sir, this can be very far-reaching. As I said earlier on, I am afraid we are woefully ignorant of the laws dealing with subterranean waters. Where a matter of this kind is concerned, which may be dealing with many, many millions of gallons of water we should look for some kind of a formula which can be applied in specific cases. The Minister can consider this as he will be vested with that power.</p>
