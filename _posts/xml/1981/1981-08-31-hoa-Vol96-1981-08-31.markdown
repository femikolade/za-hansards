<heading>APPROPRIATION BILL</heading>

<p>Vote No. 18&#x2014;&#x201C;National Education&#x201D;:</p>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, firstly, I want to say to the hon. the Minister and his department that we appreciate the annual report. It covers a very wide and full range and deals with the topics that we will be looking at today. It also helps to have the Annual Report of the Committee of Heads of Education in good time.</p>

<p>There are two matters in the annual report that I want to refer to immediately. The first is in paragraph 7.2 at the bottom of page 26 under the heading &#x201C;Committee of Inquiry into All Post-school Education and Training, Except University Training&#x201D;. It is stated here that the committee has met, that its report has been accepted by the Director-General and that draft legislation has already been drawn up. We have had so many different committees and different commissions that I am not exactly sure which one is referred to here and I would be grateful if the hon. the Minister could tell us when he replies.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the half hour.</p>

<p>On page 30 of the report I wish to refer to paragraph 4.1, &#x201C;National Study Loan and Bursary Funds&#x201D;. I do not intend to read what he said in this paragraph, but I do want to put a question or two to the hon. the Minister. It is clear that this fund is in some trouble and that it simply does not have enough money to do the job. I have been approached and told by a small businessman&#x2014;the business is small, not the man&#x2014;that up till recently you could claim tax redemption if you give a certain amount of money to this fund, namely up to R1 200 per student at a university or R1 000 per student at a technikon. People were able to choose the student and the institution. I am not sure whether this information is accurate, because this person only came to my office today and I have not had a chance to research it. However, I have been told that in the last two years this has been changed and is one of the major reasons why this fund has not received the support that one normally would imagine it to receive. Once again, I would be glad to hear from the hon. the Minister in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to refer briefly to the De Lange Report. The hon. the Minister is on record as saying that, and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government will properly consult all interested bodies before deciding on any of the recommendations of the report.</block>

<p>I put it to the hon. the Minister that the spokesmen on Education both for the official Opposition and I am sure for the NRP as well, are what might be termed interested bodies. It is extremely difficult to start a debate on the Minister&#x2019;s Vote knowing that a very far-ranging and probably far-reaching report is already in his hands, but that we have no knowledge either of the contents of the report, the recommendations or indeed the attitude of the Government towards these. It is regrettable, therefore, that we have to debate in this way without that report, because I am quite sure that the report itself is going to overtake a great deal of what we say here. Nevertheless, I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he is considering a White Paper on the De Lange Report and, if so, when this White Paper will be made available.</p>

<p>Whilst we do not have the De Lange Report, we certainly do have the Venter Report, which is a report on the quality of the working life of the White educator in the Republic. One of the findings of this project committee is what I can only describe as both shocking and astounding. The report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Schools are not succeeding in attracting sufficient staff with the required qualifications.</block>

<p>To back up its statement it lists some truly alarming figures in Table 6.1 of the actual report. These figures are as at 15 August 1980, only a year ago, and I have no reason <span class="col_211-212" refersTo="page_0117"/>to believe that they have since changed in substance. The division is between male and female teachers and they are listed under four categories. In junior primary schools, for example, 41&#x0025; of male teachers and 49&#x0025; of female teachers do not have the minimum tersiary requirements for teaching the subjects they are teaching in those schools.</p>

<p>What page is that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>There are no page numbers in the report, but I am referring to Table 6.1 in paragraph 6 of the report. In senior primary schools, i.e. Std. 2 to 4, 45&#x0025; of the men and 51&#x0025; of the women lack those basic minimum requirements. In junior secondary schools, i.e. Std. 5 to 7, 51&#x0025; of the males and 51&#x0025; of the females lack these requirements. In senior secondary schools, i.e. Std. 8 to 10, 53&#x0025; of men and 47&#x0025; of women in White schools in South Africa lack the basic minimum requirements in order to teach subjects for which they have responsibility. These figures can only be described as startling and indicate that in most standards of our schools more than 50&#x0025; of teachers have less than the minimum tertiary training required in the actual subjects which are their responsibility. I think this is stark evidence, if we need any evidence, that the crisis in education to which we have referred from time to time, still exists and is very much alive in South Africa. I think it also indicates a considerable degree of neglect. How is it possible that our schools could have reached this stage without us even being aware of it? If we were aware of it, what on earth is the Government doing about it. It makes one wonder whether one should indeed send one&#x2019;s children to school when our teachers seem so ill-prepared to do the job. I can only describe this as a bomb on the playing-fields or in the classrooms of our schools in South Africa.</p>

<p>The Venter Report goes on and identifies three factors in the working life of educators in schools which have an adverse effect on the attractiveness of the educator&#x2019;s profession. Firstly, there is remuneration, which is by far the most important factor. Secondly, freedom of decision, i.e. professional autonomy, something which we do not know a great deal about. Thirdly, organizational climate. I understand that these two, namely freedom of decision and organizational climate, will be featured in further reports. Once again I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if this is so, and if so, when we can expect the next report of the Venter Committee.</p>

<p>As a result of the findings on remuneration, the Government introduced new salary structures on 1 April 1981. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that there can be absolutely no room for complacency. If the Government believe that they have now resolved this probleem, they are labouring under a false sense of security. There remain, for example, a number of anomalies, and some of these will be raised by my colleagues during the course of this debate. I will only cite one example and that concerns the powerful Federal Council of Teachers&#x2019; Associations, which represents about 50 000 White teachers. Prof. Hennie Maree, chairman of the council, earlier this month clashed with the State concerning salaries of departmental heads and senior lecturers at teachers&#x2019; colleges. The point at issue was the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision to do away with the entrenched salary, which means in effect a loss to the staff concerned of two notches of about R900 each, and in the case of senior women teachers a loss of approximately R2 610.</p>

<p>The other point which must be made and which we ignore at our peril is that the general image of the teaching profession has taken such a knock in recent years that we have much ground to make up. There is a great deal of hard work to be done if resignations are to decrease and recruitment into the profession is to be enhanced. Most of us in this Committee who are interested and somewhat knowledgeable in the field of education and have worked in schools, colleges and universities and who keep in touch, know of a number of prestigious Government schools, let alone some of the other smaller lesser known schools, who have suffered very real losses in the last few years in the number of resignations and in recruitment which is definitely not as healthy as it should be.</p>

<p>The most staggering facts, however, were released by the Transvaal M.E.C. for Education at the time, Mr. Van der Merwe Brink. For the period January to mid-September <span class="col_213-214" refersTo="page_0118"/>1980 there had been 2 750 resignations, nearly double the number of the previous year, and this included 11,6&#x0025; of the total male teaching staff. There were 371 posts for which no teachers could be found, and in addition a large number of professionally unqualified teachers had been appointed. The situation has necessitated holding extra classes after regular hours using teachers from other schools and holiday schools for pupils.</p>

<p>This is only an indication and one does not have the time in a short Committee of this nature to deal adequately with just how serious the situation is, but if resignations have been and are desperately worrying, then recruitment is also a major probleem. A report published in <i>The Argus</i> last year gave details of the career preferences of the top 100 pupils in the National Science Olympiad. Now these are really top youngsters. Each pupil was asked to state his or her first choice, which scored one point, and an alternate, which scored half a point. Of the 150 points available I wonder if the Committee could guess how much teaching actually scored? Half a point. That is among 100 pupils in the National Science Olympiad asked to state their career preference. One out of a hundred stated it as his or her second choice. If we go on like this one wonders if there will be a science olympiad in a few years time, because who on earth is going to teach the pupils?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the new salary structures and increases have alleviated the probleem and I would like to hear from the hon. the Minister on this point whether I am right in this. I hope I am right. He will, however, agree with me that teaching is much more than salaries, important as that is. We have to appreciate the importance of education and the indispensibility of well-trained and well-motivated teachers. It may be that one of the ways in which the State can demonstrate its concern for this vital profession is by recognizing&#x2014;and the hon. member for Virginia is going to be pleased that I use this word&#x2014;what we would say is the &#x201C;peculiarity&#x201D;, but which I think the Afrikaans sums up so much better with the word &#x201C;eiesoortigheid&#x201D;, of the teaching profession. Teachers should not and cannot be classified as ordinary Public Servants. No matter how good Public Servants are, and they are in many instances, and the contribution they are making, I think we will be making a grievous error if we perpetuate this situation and do not realize the peculiarity of the teaching profession as a vocation. I hope that the De Lange Commission has something to say about this need for the re-assessment of the profession.</p>

<p>Education has been described in this Committee and in other places as a corner-stone on which the future of South Africa rests. If it is the key to the future prosperity of the country and all its peoples, then it deserves much higher priority being afforded to it today. An absolute priority is to attract more male teachers to the profession. I do not want to be accused of being a male chauvinist or whatever, but according to the figures released in the 1980 annual report of the S.A. Teachers&#x2019; Council, of the 62 546 White registered teachers 66,7&#x0025;, more than two-thirds, were female. The province with the highest female percentage was Natal. I do not know why, but perhaps the hon. member for Durban North will explain that to us. 73,6&#x0025; of all teachers in Natal are female. Even more alarming is that of teachers under the age of 30 more than 85&#x0025; are female. I want to underline that I have absolutely no reason to believe that female teachers are any less committed or professional than male teachers, but I put it to this Committee that both in the interests of professional status and the interests of the pupil the present balance is not healthy. Here I want to refer also to the acute shortage of English-speaking teachers, especially male teachers. This situation manifests itself in the small minority of English-speaking teachers in parallel medium schools and the increasing number of Afrikaans-speaking teachers in English-medium schools. I think this Committee would be at one and would hope that they would join with me in making a specific appeal&#x2014;I hope very much that the Press will give this the attention it requires&#x2014;to English-speaking people in South Africa to consider teaching as a worthwhile and satisfying career. The English teacher, especially the English male teacher, is becoming what I can only call an endangered species. Unless we do something seriously about this we are in trouble. I know hon. members may say to me that it is up to you people to do something about it, but I do not see it that way. I <span class="col_215-216" refersTo="page_0119"/>believe that all of us should be united in making this appeal.</p>

<p>I now want to say a few brief words about universities, which obviously fall under this department as well. Firstly, I want to refer briefly to the claim made by two members of the President&#x2019;s Council, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The large percentage of foreign academics at South African universities pose a threat to national security.</block>

<p>Amongst their recommendations is &#x201C;the possible withholding of Government subsidies so as to limit the number of foreign academics and also the taking of an oath by all university teachers&#x201D;. Apart from the fact that the analysis was hopelessly wrong, I hope that the hon. the Minister will discourage any suggestion that foreign academics <i>per se</i> and South African academics receiving further training in other parts of the world in order to develop their own careers, are in any way a threat to national security.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is a view that the Venter Report largely ignored the needs of university staff because of its pre-occupation, understandably, with the school-teachers&#x2019; crisis. Amongst those who have recently criticized the committee along these lines is Prof. Van Rensburg of the RAU. Hopefully the De Lange Commission will have remedied the neglect, otherwise there is no doubt that the ground of the crisis, which has largely been in the schools, will shift to the universities, and this cannot be good for the country&#x2019;s well-being.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I think everyone is only too painfully aware of the very high subsidies paid to universities by the State. We must, however, remember that it is the taxpayers&#x2019; money that is being used and not the Government&#x2019;s. There is a subtle difference. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the hon. the Minister and some of his colleagues, by implication, threaten certain universities in South Africa with the withdrawal of subsidies unless they toe the line. These implied threats made by Cabinet Ministers followed the reaction of some students to the recent Republican Festival. I want to say that I believe these threats were an overreaction and a further inroad into the limited autonomy of the universities concerned. I want to say also that the University of the Witwatersrand, the University of Cape Town and the University of Natal have a very long and proud record in South Africa and I believe they can take care of their own discipline and the running of their own universities. When we bear in mind the desperate need for skilled workers and well-trained people in South Africa the hon. the Minister himself must surely realize that any threat to remove subsidies of key universities is both empty and meaningless.</p>

<p>I would like to know from the hon. the Minister what the Government&#x2019;s policy is regarding open universities. There has been considerable debate and speculation in the media and at conferences and when we bear in mind the increased number of Black students at so-called White universities I think it is imperative that South Africa should know exactly where the Government stands as far as higher education is concerned. Several rectors of leading universities stated that universities should be opened to all races, that the decision who should come into an university should be left to the universities themselves. May I ask the hon. the Minister whether it is still against Nationalist policy that universities should be open? Is the Government still committed to the policy of separate institutions or has it come to its senses and realized that open universities are both desirable and inevitable? While I am on this subject, I would like the hon. the Minister to state the Government&#x2019;s policy on technikons. This is a new and fairly recent development in our South African life and education and, I think, a very good move. We in the official Opposition have made no secret of the fact that we believe, for many reasons, that it would be of enormous benefit to all South Africans and to South Africa as a whole if technikons were to be unequivocally open to all. This should be especially true of the new technikon which is soon to be built in District 6. Nothing can take away the anguish and heartache of the destruction of a community, but a statement by the Minister today that technikons, including the technikon to be built in District 6, would be open to people of all races on the basis of merit, would go a long way or at least some way to alleviate what has been an indefensible course of action by the Government.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to put it on record that I find it limiting and devoid of common sense to discuss the education of Whites in <span class="col_217-218" refersTo="page_0120"/>isolation from the educational needs of the entire country. Clearly, if I were to try and transgress in this way you would, Mr. Chairman, rightly overrule me and call me to order. Let me, therefore, in a concluding sentence stress that I hope that this is the last time this Vote is discussed in such a limited and truncated fashion, and that next year, in the next session of Parliament, we will together look at the total educational challenge facing the total South Africa.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, allereers wil ek die agb. Minister, hoewel hy reeds met sy aanstelling in hierdie pos geluk-gewens is, sterkte toewens waar hy nou vandag die eerste keer die bespreking van sy begrotingspos hanteer. Ons twyfel nie dat ons vandag weer van die besondere kennis wat hy oor die onderwerp het, gebruik sal kan maak nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil die departement andermaal van harte gelukwens met die uitstekende jaarverslag wat hulle die lig laat sien het. Ek is daarvan oortuig dat dit seker een van die jaarverslae is wat die meeste statistieke en inligting bevat wat ons al in &#x2019;n verslag van hierdie aard gekry het. Ons wil vir dr. Van Wyk en sy personeel van harte bedank en gelukwens met die uitstekende jaarverslag.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook my dank betuig aan die georganiseerde professie, t.w. die Federale Raad sowel as die verskillende onderwysersver-enigings, vir die besondere bydrae wat hulle met betrekking tot onderwys in ons land lewer. Ek wil ook die S.A. Onderwysersraad&#x2014;ek sal later weer hierna verwys&#x2014;van harte bedank, en veral hul voorsitter, prof. Van Loggerenberg, wat in die tyd toe daar woelinge met betrekking tot die salariskwes-sie was, so gesond en gebalanseerd opgetree het in die gees van die status wat onderwy-sers het. Les bes sal ek baie graag ook my persoonlike dank, as iemand wat lank in die onderwys gestaan het, wil betuig aan onder-wysers en dosente aan universiteite, technikons, onderwyserskolleges en so meer vir die uitmuntende werk wat hulle doen.</p>

<p>Ek wil kortliks reageer op &#x2019;n paar aange-leenthede wat die agb. lid vir Pinelands geopper het. Sommige daarvan sal deur ander lede aan hierdie kant bespreek word, maar ek wil graag na twee of drie daarvan verwys.</p>

<p>Die eerste het te doen met die minimum tersi&#x00EA;re opleidingsvereistes waaraan ons onderwysers mank gaan. Dit is &#x2019;n feit, want die Venterverslag het dit aan ons uitgewys, maar dit is niks nuuts nie. Ons het hierdie kwessie reeds in die verlede gedebatteer. Die vraag is eintlik waarom dit so is. Dit is dan ook die vraag wat die agb. lid vir Pine-lands gestel het. Daar is verskeie redes hiervoor en een van die belangrikstes hou waar-skynlik verband met diensvoorwaardes in die bre&#x00EB; sin, maar meer bepaald met die kwessie van salarisse. Hierdie saak is tot groot hoogte reggestel met die jongste salarisaan-passings. In hierdie verband het die agb. lid vir Pinelands ges&#x00EA; dat die saak nie heeltemal opgelos sal word deur die huidige salarisver-hogings nie. Ek wil graag vir die agb. lid vir Pinelands wys op wat prof. Hennie Maree, die voorsitter van die Federale Raad, in hierdie verband ges&#x00EA; het. Ek lees voor uit <i>Mondstuk</i> van Maart 1981, soos volg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Gesonde grondslag is gel&#x00EA; vir verdere positiewe ontwikkelinge en die wete dat onderwysersalarisse op &#x2019;n deurlopende grondslag verdere aandag sal geniet, stel die Federale Raad in &#x2019;n posisie om nou na buite te verklaar dat hy die huidige optrede van die Regering i.v.m. onderwysersalarisse as billik, grootmoedig en reg-verdig kan bestempel.</block>

<p>Dit sluit ook aan by wat die agb. lid ges&#x00EA; het, nl. dat alles nog nie heeltemal wel is met betrekking tot die nuwe salarisstrukture nie. Ek lees verder&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die uitvoerende komitee is met die inligting tot sy beskikking tevrede dat die Regering van die dag en die onderwysbe-heerowerhede &#x2019;n besondere poging aangewend het om nou &#x2019;n salarisbedeling vir die onderwys daar te stel wat daarop gemik sal wees om &#x2019;n probleem wat oor dekades ontwikkel het bevredigend op te los.</block>

<p>Ek is die heel eerste wat sal s&#x00EA; dat daar natuurlik nie &#x2019;n stelsel is wat geheel en al vry van anomalie&#x00EB; is nie. Sodra &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n nuwe salarisstruktuur instel, sal daar noodwendig anomalie&#x00EB; wees wat mettertyd uit die weg geruim moet word. Ons moet egter nie daar-die kleiner probleme tot die belangrikstes verhef nie. Hier het prof. Maree die belang-rike probleme uitgelig en ons wil hom <span class="col_219-220" refersTo="page_0121"/>bedank dat hy die saak so gestel het. Daar was egter ook &#x2019;n tweede saak waaroor die agb. lid vir Pinelands hom uitgespreek het t.w. dat onderwysers nie as gewone staats-amptenare geklassifiseer en gesien kan word nie. Ek wil sonder voorbehoud met die agb. lid saamstem dat dit inderdaad so is en oor die jare heen het ek asook ander agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad beklemtoon dat &#x2019;n onderwyser iemand is wat in &#x2019;n beroep staan in teenstelling met baie ander persone in die Staatsdiens. In daardie opsig stem ek met die agb. lid vir Pinelands saam en ek sal later terugkom op dit wat ek in hierdie verband wil s&#x00EA;. Die agb. lid vir Pine-lands het ges&#x00EA; dat hy glo dat hy namens ons almal praat as hy ons wys op die tekort aan Engelssprekende onderwysers. Ek kan nie onthou in watter jaar dit was nie, maar in &#x2019;n bepaalde debat wat so drie of vier jaar gelede plaasgevind het, het ons van hierdie kant van die Raad die saak spesifiek ook aan die deur van die Opposisie-partye gel&#x00EA;. Ons het hulle destyds daarop gewys dat hulle &#x2019;n beroep op die Engelssprekendes moet doen om hulle tot die onderwys te wend. Ek wil nou baie dankie aan die agb. lid vir Pine-lands s&#x00EA; dat hy vandag gedoen het wat ons hulle drie of vier jaar gelede gevra het om te doen. Ek wil hoop dat sy versoek nie op dowe ore sal val nie want dit is inderdaad nodig dat ook die Engelssprekendes hulle tot die onderwys moet wend.</p>

<p>Sover dit die sogenaamde dreigement betref wat aan sommige universiteite gerig sou gewees het oor die onttrekking van hul subsidies sal my kollegas aan hierdie kant van die Raad daarop antwoord. Hulle sal ook antwoord oor die kwessie van oop universiteite, &#x2019;n onderwerp waarna ek ook later sal verwys. Die voorsiening van onderwys aan Blankes afsonderlik van ander bevolkingsgroepe is ook &#x2019;n onderwerp waaroor ek my sienswyse sal uitspreek in die loop van my toespraak.</p>

<p>Voorts wil ek verwys na wat ek as onder-wysstelsels sal beskryf. Wanneer ek my oor onderwysstelsels uitspreek, is dit nodig dat ek in die eerste plek aan hierdie Komitee sal verduidelik wat ek verstaan onder die begrip onderwysstelsels. As ek van &#x2019;n onderwysstel-sel praat, beskou ek daardie begrip as die struktuur waarin die kuituur en die opvoedende onderwys van &#x2019;n volk of &#x2019;n volksgroep ten nouste vervleg is en wat noodwendig moet uitloop op beplande, georganiseerde en geko&#x00F6;rdineerde verskaffing van onder-wysdienste binne so &#x2019;n bepaalde staat volgens die waardes en die norme wat die volk of daardie besondere volksgroep onontbeer-lik vir sy voortbestaan ag. Ek maak dus met ander woorde &#x2019;n onderskeid tussen &#x2019;n stelsel met sy eie onderwys gekoppel aan die kuituur van &#x2019;n bepaalde volksgroep teenoor &#x2019;n ander stelsel wat presies dieselfde uitgangspunt gebruik, met ander woorde onderwysstelsels wat langs mekaar loop. Sover dit die Blanke betref, net die volgende: Die Wet op Nasionale Onderwysbeleid, Wet No. 39 van 1967, bepaal dat die Blanke onderwys &#x2019;n Christelike karakter moet h&#x00EA; en dat die geloofsoortuiging van ouers en kinders by godsdiensonderrig eerbiedig moet word. Sonder om verder daaroor uit te wei s&#x00EA; ek dat, wat my betref, staan of val hierdie kant van die Raad by daardie standpunt. Ek wil egter verder s&#x00EA; dat dieselfde Wet ook bepaal dat daar &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB; nasionale karakter binne die Blanke onderwys moet wees en dit is in ooreenstemming met die beginsel van die selfbeskikkingsreg van volkere waaroor gedebatteer is toe die Pos van die agb. Eerste Minister verlede week bespreek is. Omdat die bre&#x00EB; nasionale karakter van elke volk gekoppel is aan die selfbeskikkingsreg&#x2014;wat onverhandelbaar is&#x2014;staan of val ek en hierdie kant van die Raad daarby soos by die Christelike karakter van die onder-wysstelsel van die Blanke. Dit beteken dat die onderwys gebed is in die tradisie, kuituur en die wesenskenmerke van die volk wat dit bedien want persoon, kuituur en volk vorm &#x2019;n onafskeidbare dinamiese eenheid waaraan ons niks kan doen nie. Die tyd verhoed my om ten Volle aan agb. lede voor te lees uit &#x2019;n stuk&#x2014;hoewel ek dit sal doen indien dit later van my verwag word&#x2014;waaruit dit blyk dat in 1978 niemand anders as sir Harry Oppenheimer, dit in &#x2019;n referaat wat hy by die Univer-siteit van Witwatersrand gelewer het, erken het en ges&#x00EA; het dat dit as sodanig aanvaar word.

As ek dit ges&#x00EA; het, is dit ook waar dat skakeling tussen die onderskeie onderwysstelsels van die verskillende bevolkingsgroepe myns insiens noodsaaklik is vir die eenvoudige rede dat die produkte van die verskillende onderwysstelsels hulself in een gemeenskaplike arbeidsmark bevind. Dit is dus gebiedend noodsaaklik dat daar ko&#x00F6;rdinasie sal wees oor sake soos leerplanne, eksaminering, sertifisering, die opleiding van onderwysers, diensvoorwaardes, salarisskale ens. Daar moet dus ko&#x00F6;rdinasie tussen die onderwysstelsel van die verskillende volksgroepe wees.</p>

Die ideaal behoort te wees om op &#x2019;n geko&#x00F6;rdineerde wyse gelyke geleenthede vir die onderwys van alle bevolkingsgroepe met behoud&#x2014;en dit is belangrik&#x2014;en die bewaring van die identiteit van elke afsonderlike bevolkingsgroep, te gee. Ek s&#x00EA; dit want onderwysstelsels wat ontwerp is vir die groep wat dit dien kan eiesoortig wees sonder om minderwaardig te wees. Dit is die belangrike punt wat ook daardie kant van die Raad moet aanvaar, te wete, dat verskillende onderwysstelsels nie noodwendig meebring dat een minderwaardig teenoor die ander hoef te wees nie.</p>

<p>Wat die toekomstige ontplooiing van onderwys betref, wil ek daarop wys dat die onderwys meer op toekomsbehoeftes in die arbeidsveld ingestel moet wees. Ek kan dit in &#x2019;n paar sinne saamvat deur te s&#x00EA; dat daar in die gewone sekond&#x00EA;re skool, wat my betref, weinig onderskeid is tussen akade-miese, tegniese en beroepsonderrig. Daarom vind ons dikwels dat &#x2019;n kind homself in &#x2019;n bepaalde rigting bevind waarin hy nie belang stel nie en dit moet noodwendig tot swakker akademiese prestasies lei en moontlik ook tot &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r druipsyfer. Dikwels is &#x2019;n kind in &#x2019;n bepaalde rigting geplaas ook omdat daar &#x2019;n mate van status kleef aan die suiwere akademiese rigting en daarom vind &#x2019;n mens dat &#x2019;n kind dikwels deur ouers in &#x2019;n bepaalde rigting gedruk word. Dieselfde verskynsel vind ons ook by ons universiteite. Ek wil ook daarop wys dat tersi&#x00EA;re onderwys vandag eenvoudig te duur is vir iemand om toe-gelaat te word om by &#x2019;n universiteit te studeer slegs ter verwerwing van &#x2019;n graad en sonder dat hy enige loopbaan voor o&#x00EB; het waarin hy besondere dienste kan lewer. Om dit te voorkom meen ek dat beroepsvoorligting &#x2019;n baie belangriker plek moet inneem&#x2014;veral by die prim&#x00EA;re skool en reeds in die junior sekond&#x00EA;re fase&#x2014;sodat die kind daartoe gelei kan word om in &#x2019;n bepaalde rigting te beweeg met die oog op die beroep wat hy eendag gaan beoefen. Wat myself betref, hou ek nog by my standpunt dat differensiasie onder dieselfde dak nooit dieselfde resul-tate kan lewer as differensiasie onder aparte dakke nie, m.a.w. in aparte skole nie. Ek is daarvan oortuig en hoewel ek nie tyd het om myself verder daaroor uit te spreek nie, wil ek net daardie stelling maak.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by die onderwyser.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. CLASE</person>:</from>

<p>Nee, mnr. die Voor-sitter, ek het te min tyd. Dit bring my by die onderwyser en ek wil aanhaal wat Henry Adams ges&#x00EA; het. Hy s&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A teacher affects eternity. He can never tell where his influence stops.</block>

<p>Dit is baie waar en dit dui op die geweldige verantwoordelikheid van die onderwyser. Ek dink dat almal met my sal saamstem dat die onderwyser die belangrikste meningsvormer is van die volk van more. Dit geld op alle terreine, ten opsigte van die kerk, die kuituur, politiek, sport ens. Om onderwys te gee is nie slegs om kennis by te bring nie en daarom moet die onderwyser self&#x2014;en dit is vir my belangrik&#x2014;toegerus wees met &#x2019;n gesonde lewens-en w&#x00EA;reldbeskouing wat ooreenstem met di&#x00E9; van die volk waaraan hy behoort. Deur sy woorde en sy optrede vorm hierdie onderwyser die karakter van die leerling en daardeur uiteindelik die karakter van die volk waaraan daardie onderwyser behoort. Die klaskamer is die <span class="col_223-224" refersTo="page_0123"/>spie&#x00EB;lbeeld van die lewenswaardes van die volk wat hy bedien. Daarom is dit so waar wat prof. Van Loggerenberg s&#x00EA; en omdat hy dit so pragtig saamgevat het, wil ek dit aanhaal. Hy s&#x00EA; die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die onderwyser met die regte lewens-beskouing bly die beste gids, die beste leerstof, die beste leermiddel, die beste metode en die beste onderwyspraktyk.</block>

<p>Ek meen dat enigeen wat binne die onderwys staan, hierdie stelling sal onderskryf. As die onderwyser so &#x2019;n belang-rike persoon in die volkshuishouding is, is dit noodsaaklik dat die werwing en die keuring van onderwysers van die uiterste belang sal wees. Laat ek dit dadelik s&#x00EA;: Die onderwyser speel &#x2019;n ontsettend belangrike rol by die werwing van die toekomstige onderwyser. Hy is die beste verkoopsman van sy eie professie. Ek wil graag die volgende vraag stel omdat dit &#x2019;n geweldige verantwoordelik-heid is waaraan die onderwyser onderwerp is: Hoe verkoop hy sy professie en met watter oorgawe doen hy dit?</p>

<p>Vanwe&#x00EB; die belangrikheid van die taak van die onderwyser is dit ook van kardinale belang dat die regte persone tot die onder-wysberoep sal toetree. Om die keuring van toekomstige onderwysstudente reg te hanteer, moet die uiteindelike taak van die onderwyser die norm vorm wanneer daar ges&#x00EA;ls word oor die keuring van onderwysstudente. Daar kan nog baie gedoen word om die diensvoorwaardes van onderwysers te verbeter, afgesien van die salarisse, soos verdere verslae nog sal aandui. Diensvoorwaardes alleenlik kan egter nie &#x2019;n groep mense na die onderwys trek sonder dat hulle in hul hart voel dat hulle vir daardie professie geroepe is nie. Ek is bevrees dat die huidige stelsel van keuring nie doeltreffend genoeg is om te verseker dat die mees geskikte persone tot die onderwys toetree nie. Akademiese en sportprestasies is wel van belang maar m&#x00E9;&#x00E9;r nog sulke dinge soos kulturele belangstelling, lewens-en w&#x00EA;reldbe-skouing, die klimaat waarin so &#x2019;n persoon opgroei, persoonlikheidseienskappe ens. Dit is almal eienskappe wat &#x2019;n rol moet speel by die keuring van &#x2019;n student wat tot die onderwys wil toetree.</p>

<p>Die opleiding van die onderwyser is natuurlik van ewe groot belang. As ek na die taak en verantwoordelikheid van die onderwyser kyk en na die plek van die onderwys-professie onder al die ander professies, het ek bedenkinge oor die tydsduur van die opleiding van onderwysers. Ek meen dat daar eenvoudig na hierdie aspek gekyk sal moet word want ek is nie so seker dat &#x2019;n opleiding van drie jaar vir prim&#x00EA;re onderwys en &#x2019;n opleiding van vier jaar vir sekond&#x00EA;re onderwys genoegsaam is nie. Indien die onderwyser dieselfde gesag en status as ander professies wil handhaaf sal daar na die opleidingsvereistes van ander professies gekyk moet word om di&#x00E9; van die onderwys op dieselfde vlak te bring. Ek wil weer eens vra vir gesamentlike akademiese en professionele opleiding met veel meer tyd wat aan praktiese opleiding afgestaan word in die skool en in die klaskamer. Absolute skeiding van die akademiese en die professionele opleiding vir sekond&#x00EA;re onderwysstudente bevredig myns insiens net nie. Meer onder-wysgerigte leerplanne en grade sal die gespe-sialiseerde kennis van die onderwyser bo alle twyfel verseker.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ten slotte &#x2019;n paar woorde oor die status van die onderwyser s&#x00EA;. Die onderwyser self gee groter status aan die beroep as wat enige wetgewing of diensvoorwaardes kan doen. Die status van die professie word gekenmerk deur die professionele gedrag van die onderwyser self en dit is juis daarom dat ek so harthk saamstem met prof. Van Loggerenberg, as voorsitter van die Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersraad, want hy het hierdie aspek by verskeie geleenthede na vore gebring. As die onderwyser daarin slaag is dit net so belangrik dat die onderwys&#x2014;as gevolg van die belangrikheid daarvan&#x2014;ho&#x00EB; aansien by die gemeenskap moet geniet. Ek is bevrees dat die onderwyser en die onderwys as sodanig nie meer die agting geniet wat dit &#x2019;n paar dekades gelede geniet het nie. Ek meen dat die gemeenskap na daardie vlak moet terugkom.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Virginia het aan verskeie aspekte van die onderwys geraak naamlik die kwessie van diensvoorwaardes vir onderwysers, die onderwysstelsels en natuurlik ook sy sienswyse van die onderliggende filosofie van Christelik nasionale opvoeding. Ek gaan min of meer oor dieselfde faktore <span class="col_225-226" refersTo="page_0124"/>praat en moontlik inskakel by sekere aspekte waama die agb. lid vanmiddag verwys het. In die eerste instansie wil ek aan hom s&#x00EA; dat die NRP ook die basiese beginsel ondersteun dat die opvoeding van die kind op prim&#x00EA;re en sekond&#x00EA;re vlak wel groepsge-bonde of kultuurgerig kan wees. Daar kom egter &#x2019;n sekere tyd in die opvoedingsproses wanneer die weerbaarheid van daardie kind ontwikkel het tot &#x2019;n punt waar hy sy eie gang kan gaan in die wye w&#x00EA;reld. &#x2019;n Mens vra jouself die vraag of dit in belang van die kind is&#x2014;en dus ook van die gemeenskap waarin hy leef&#x2014;om hom op &#x2019;n nou paadjie te hou tot op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak en hom eers dan die geleentheid te bied om die wye w&#x00EA;reld binne te tree. Ons glo natuurlik dat tot op die sekond&#x00EA;re vlak&#x2014;miskien tot st. 8&#x2014;dit nodig is om van &#x2019;n kultuurgebonde onderwysstelsel te praat, &#x2019;n Mens moet dan egter ondersoek instel om te sien of die behoud van &#x2019;n beginsel &#x2019;n goeie ding is en of &#x2019;n mens nie miskien die kind se opvoedingsproses inkort deur ook op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak daarop aan te dring dat die opvoedingsproses nog kultuurgebonde moet wees nie. Ons vra net die vraag want ons beleid is baie duidelik, dat na opvoeding op sekond&#x00EA;re vlak dit wel in belang van die kind is&#x2014;en dus in belang van die hele bevolking&#x2014;om &#x2019;n uitbreidingsproses aan die gang te sit.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there are a number of items I would like to deal with today during this, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s very first Vote. We would also like to welcome him to this particular portfolio. He is one of those hon. Ministers whose reputation has gone ahead of him in many spheres. He has, of course, raised tremendous expectations, not only of hon. members of this Committee, but the population as a whole, that education will be seen in a different light from what some of his predecessors saw it and also that he will be a man who will ensure that the proper perspective and importance in priority is given to education in South Africa that is due to it. We find ourselves in a very interesting position in South Africa today. The hon. member for Pinelands referred to a crisis in education and we find that our whole educational system&#x2014;and I am speaking of both Whites and other sectors&#x2014;is really in a phase of &#x201C;implosion&#x201D; as opposed to the population explosion. There are many reasons why we find this disparity between the expectations of what the educational system can do and what it is actually capable of doing. Education, in the view of the majority of the population of Africa, is seen as the key which opens the door of opportunity. If ever there was a human right with legitimate claim that society owes an individual, I believe hon. members will agree with me when I say that human right is the right to education. It is probably the only human right which society owes the individual legitimately. In that respect I believe that this hon. Minister has a very important and responsible portfolio and that the expectations which have been raised with his appointment to this ministry should be fulfilled in the eyes of the whole population. We in the NRP believe that the reason why we have the probleem with teachers&#x2014;particularly as far as White education is concerned&#x2014;is to be found both in the historical as well as the comtemporary context. Hon. members will be aware that the Government decided after 1948 that education was to become one of the major instruments for the implementation of the philosophy of the party. As such it was inadvertently decided&#x2014;although with a fair amount of insight into the probleem&#x2014;that education would be the prerogative of those individuals, particularly those appointed to senior posts, who are the greatest supporters of the philosophy of the governing party. For that reason as well as others&#x2014;that is in the historical context&#x2014;we should not be surprised to find that many members of the White population of South Africa decided to find careers in other areas. I refer particularly to the one aspect namely male English-speaking teachers who if they found that their promotional opportunities were blocked in the field of education, they would go to another area such as commerce or industry where their talents could be used and rewarded without the consideration of whether they supported the governing party&#x2019;s philosophy or not. I believe that that was one of the major reasons why we are today reaping the bitter fruits of that sort of approach. I believe that the winds of change have blown in the NP despite what the <i>Sunday Express</i> said last Sunday because that newspaper stated that the winds of change will not blow on education. We detect in the governing party that they are moving away <span class="col_227-228" refersTo="page_0125"/>from these antiquated approaches to education and as I said earlier, the hon. the Minister himself is a man whose reputation has gone ahead of him despite the fact that the quotation in the <i>Sunday Express</i> of 30 August states&#x2014;and this is what they quote the hon. the Minister as having said in an interview with <i>Die Beeld&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">The Government, he said, has repeatedly stated its view that each population group must have its own schools and the qualified opening of universities and technikons would have no influence on the Government&#x2019;s policy on schools.</block>

<p>Presumably the hon. the Minister has been correctly quoted. However, in this respect I believe that it is a major break-through in the sense that at least at this day and age we are at least considering the opening of technikons and universities. I believe that it is impossible to take any other stance on education. After all, education is one of the most important portfolios in the political field and the field of the development of infrastructure in South Africa. We certainly hope that the results of the three commissions that are sitting on education at the moment will bear fruit, evidence and witness to the importance which we place on education today. The hon. the Minister is going to reply to us later on and he will tell us what his attitude is going to be should the De Lange Commission of the HSRC request the hon. the Minister to put legislative changes into operation which will allow tertiary education in particular to be available to all members of all population groups. I look forward to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply in this respect. If we look at some of the more recent statistics available we can see the importance of opening tertiary educational institutions to all population groups. I have a graph in front of me which was prepared by Sanso in a report called &#x201C;Verslag&#x201D; and this indicates the magnitude of the probleem which the hon. the Minister is going to be faced with. As at 1981&#x2014;and I am using rounded-off figures&#x2014;the number of Indian university entrants, that is school-leavers who have university entrance qualifications, number in the region of 2 000 per annum. In the case of the Coloureds it is 2 500, in the case of Blacks it is 9 000 and Whites 25 000. I am mentioning these figures because one must see White education in its total social context in relation to the other groups. If the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude is supportive of the concept that technikons and universities should be open to other population groups, these are the kind of problems that he is going to face. If we project those figures we will see that the number of Whites with university entrance qualifications in the year 1990 will be in the region of 30 000 and in that particular year the number of Black school-leavers with university entrance qualifications will also number 30 000 whereas the number of Coloureds and Indians would only have moved up marginally. If we want to see the futuristic situation of Africa and the amount of infrastructure development which is going to occur&#x2014;and this is the reason why we believe it is going to be impossible to have separate universities and tertiary educational institutions for all population groups&#x2014;is to be found in the projections for the year 2009.

<p>Ek bedank die agb. lid vir daardie geleentheid.</p>

<p>If we look at the year 2009 we shall see that the number of Blacks who will have university entrance qualifications is the staggering figure&#x2014;based on current population projections&#x2014;of 98 000. Collectively the Indians, Whites and Coloureds will only represent 48 000 and that figure includes 29 000 Whites&#x2014;hon. members of the Committee will note the decrease in the number of White university entrants due to a decrease in the population&#x2014;whilst there are 12 000 Coloureds and 7 000 Indians. If the year 2009 sounds a long way off the Committee should take note of the fact that it is only 29 years away. I am sure that most of us will still be around in that year although we may not be in the same position as we are at the moment. One thing is sure, our educational process will not have discontinued if we are still here. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister how he views the whole question of tertiary education. I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he <span class="col_229-230" refersTo="page_0126"/>would be prepared to comment on his attitude in regard to the subsidies paid to private schools. We seem to have a discrepancy here which is inexplicable in terms of logic although it may be understandable in terms of certain other factors which the hon. the Minister may have some knowledge of. We in the NRP believe that private schools have a very definite and important role to play in primary and secondary education. We believe that it is the democratic right of every parent in South Africa to decide what type of institution he would like to send his child to. I believe that the standard and quality of our State schools are excellent but perhaps for other reasons such as tradition, feelings of kinship, old boy reasons and educational reasons a large number of parents would prefer at some stage or another to expose their children to the benefits of a private school education. This in no way implies that the standard of education in our State schools is inferior. It is interesting to note that the Province of Natal was first to recognize this need and to make fiscal provision for subsidies for private schools. It certainly paid handsome dividends because if one looks at the real savings to the State such savings are to be found in the fact that the cost of the infrastructure of establishing a private school is normally borne by private institutions, churches and other interested parties. Therefore, to a very large extent, it is also relieving the State of the burden of providing that education. The Province of Natal has taken the lead in this respect followed fairly closely by the Orange Free State and very recently we are happy to say that the Cape Province also saw its way clear to provide subsidies for private schools. Let me say that if it were not for the timeous action of the Cape Provincial Administration at least 40&#x0025; of those private schools would have gone into liquidation and they would have suffered a close-down. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister why it is that the Transvaal is unable to see its way clear to also provide subsidies for private schools. The hon. the Minister has been petitioned &#x2026; [Interjections.] I should like to hear about it. Is it to the same extent as the other provinces? Why has there been this protracted battle to get subsidies and why is it that we have this differential approach to the subsidies of private schools through out South Africa? They are not all the same. The hon. member for Standerton said they were; and to think he lives just outside the borders of Natal.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. B. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>He is almost in Natal and he is getting very close. However, he will recognize and understand that there is a differentiation in the quantitive aspects of subsidies to private schools. We would like to know from the hon. the Minister why this should be so and what his attitude is. However, I am sure the hon. the Minister agrees with all hon. members both on that side and this side that private schools do play a very important role.</p>

<p>I should like to turn very briefly to the question of teacher training, because this will be the major infrastructural impediment to the development of our educational system in South Africa. Again, one must take a holistic view of education. We cannot look at White education in isolation, because the expectations of other groups are formulated to a large extent by their perception of the benefits and infrastructural qualities of the other groups.</p>

<p>For the record, Sir, using the most recent figures available for a comparative analysis, in 1978 in round figures the total stock of White teachers was 47 000 and the pupil content was 955 000, giving one a pupilteacher ratio of 20,3 to 1. That is to say, there was one teacher to every 20,3 pupils. In 1979, a year later&#x2014;I should like to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that 1979 was the first year in which a decline in university enrolment was detected for certain universities, although not overall&#x2014;we find a teacher stock of 48 000 and a pupil stock of 953 000, giving a ratio of one teacher for every 19,8 pupils. That was therefore a marginal improvement.</p>

<p>Let us, however, look at the position as regards the Black population. This is going to prove one of the major impediments, even if there is a change of attitude on the part of the Government as regards the improvement of educational facilities. The major impediment is not going to be fiscal or infrastructural, but the stock of teachers available to teach the pupils. In 1978 there <span class="col_231-232" refersTo="page_0127"/>was a teacher stock of 66 000 to a pupil population of 3,2 million, which gives a ratio of one teacher to 49 pupils. In 1979 the teacher stock was 72 000 and the pupil stock was 3,4 million, giving a ratio of 1 to 48,3, a marginal improvement. One must bear in mind that just to create parity in the infrastructure of Black education in kwaZulu alone, i.e. to provide the same number of schools and teachers in proportion to the number of pupils as for the Whites, it will cost Natal and kwaZulu R785 million. That probleem, just to provide parity, is bad enough. However, even if we could find the R785 million required to provide parity&#x2014;and hon. members must remember that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s total budget for this year is R511 million while that of the hon. the Minister of Education and Training is lower, being approximately R360 million or R370 million&#x2014;we would still be saddled with a probleem. One can therefore appreciate the magnitude of the fiscal probleem in kwaZulu.</p>

<p>My request to the hon. the Minister is whether we cannot bring White married women back into the educational system for Whites. Often they are put off because they are temporary teachers. They leave of their own free will because the benefits are not good enough. We seem to be deliberately reducing the stock of White teachers. Is it not possible to alleviate the teacher shortage in the other population groups by the better utilization of the White teachers who are available? I ask this because this is where the major impediment is going to be. I see that the hon. member for Standerton is raring to go. No doubt he has some answers to give us here. I believe that we shall have to pay very urgent attention to the question of the provision of an adequate stock of well-trained teachers. The hon. member for Pinelands indicated&#x2014;possibly there are also historical reasons for the end result&#x2014;what sort of a qualitative probleem we have as regards teachers, let alone a quantitative probleem. I believe that the only way in which in the short and medium terms we are going to be able to alleviate the probleem of the stock of teachers for the other population groups will be to encourage those Whites who form a surplus in White requirements to move over and assist the other population groups. I think that the hon. member for Standerton will probably say that this is already being done and that he will indicate that a large number of White teachers already go and assist in Soweto, but we want the alleviation of this shortage by using White teachers actively promoted. We do not simply want the use of White teachers in other institutions for other population groups tolerated. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek waardeer die rustige klimaat waarin ons onder u leiding hier verkeer. Dit is in besonder te danke aan die agb. Minister dat ons in die huidige tydsgewrig nie weer die krete en Persberigte kry soos die &#x201E;Red ons, red ons dr. Gerrit&#x201D; wat in die verlede in &#x2019;n Persberig verskyn het nie. Daar het in ons onderwyskorps gesindheidsverandering ingetree. Ek dink dat hierdie klimaat ook &#x2019;n positiewe uitwerking sal h&#x00EA; op die werwing van matriku-lante vir die onderwysberoep.</p>

<p>Ek voel ook gelukkig oor die gesprekke wat plaasgevind het tussen die agb. Minister, as hoof van die departement, en die professionele liggaam van die onderwysers. Ek het waardering daarvoor dat daardie mense deur middel van die Onderwysersraad, spierkrag ontwikkel het. Ons het dit in die Volksraad bepleit dat daar &#x2019;n professionele spreekbuis vir onderwysers geskep moes word waardeur hulle kon praat. Die nut daarvan het in die optrede van hierdie liggaam na vore gekom. Dit is goed dat twee vennote wat albei spierkrag het, saamwerk. Albei moet onder-nemingskrag en onderhandelingskrag h&#x00EA;. Ons wil die agb. Minister daarvoor bedank.</p>

<p>Ek wil kortliks terugkom op sommige van die toesprake wat reeds gelewer is. Ek wil net &#x2019;n opmerking of twee maak oor aspekte wat die agb. lid vir Pinelands aangeraak het. Ek dink dat op die prim&#x00EA;re vlak in besonder daar so &#x2019;n sterk aanvulling van gekwali-fiseerde mense was om die take in die juniorprim&#x00EA;re-en seniorprim&#x00EA;re-fases te verrig dat ons nie bekommerd daaroor hoef te wees nie. Selfs wat die opleiding van onderwyseresse vir preprim&#x00EA;re onderwys betref, kom daar &#x2019;n komponent, in hul kursusse by wat hulle genoeg lading gee sodat hulle met nut in die juniorprim&#x00EA;re-en seniorprim&#x00EA;re-fases gebruik kan word. Op di&#x00E9; gebied is daar by ons onderwyskolleges deeglike beplanning. Met die jaarlikse inname van studente word hulle gekeur, ongeag die studierigting wat die voornemende <span class="col_233-234" refersTo="page_0128"/>student in matriek gekies het. Die kolleges het projeksies vir die behoeftes oor vier jaar wanneer daardie studente afgestu-deer het. Dan kanaliseer hulle die studente, in same werking met die studente, na bepaalde studie-terreine na gelang van die behoeftes vir sover hulle vooruitbepaal kan word. Ek weet dat daar by ons onderwyskol-leges dwarsdeur die land deeglike en sinvolle beplanning is ten opsigte van hierdie aspekte.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het egter reg dat daar ten opsigte van sekere vakke nog werklik behoeftes is. Kom ons verwys maar daarna as die &#x201E;skaars vakke&#x201D;. Daar is werklik &#x2019;n tekort aan onderwysers in sekere vakrigtings. Dit bestaan egter nie net by skole nie, maar ook by ons kolleges, technikons en universiteite.</p>

<p>Ek wil s&#x00EA; dat daardie mense moeilik bekombaar is. As &#x2019;n mens by groot bedryfsondememings soos Sasol kom, sal hulle vir jou s&#x00EA; hulle soek ook na skei-kundiges. Die agb. lid het ook verwys na die moontlike werwing van onderwysers in die buiteland. Die agb. Minister kan sy oordeel daaroor gee. Ek glo nie dit is &#x2019;n deur wat ons heeltemal hoef te sluit nie. Ons kan sekerlik van daardie mense werf.</p>

<p>Ek wil op die private sektor &#x2019;n beroep doen, &#x2019;n Mens wonder soms of professionele mense in die private sektor nie byvoorbeeld aan ons universiteite hul hulp moet aanbied nie. Dit vind byvoorbeeld op die mediese terrein plaas dat &#x2019;n medikus wat sy eie praktyk in die stad het, ook &#x2019;n aanstelling het om by die mediese skool van die universiteit lesings te gee. Sal dit nie moontlik wees om &#x2019;n ingenieur wat sy eie praktyk het, te kry om &#x2019;n deel van sy dag aan &#x2019;n universiteit af te staan nie? Hy hoef dit nie gratis te doen nie. Op hierdie wyse kan hierdie mense benut word deur hul kundigheid en vermo&#x00EB; aan die studente beskikbaar te stel. Die studente kan daardeur net baat. Hierdie mense staan in die praktiese veld en kan dus miskien &#x2019;n ryper praktiese ervaring oordra aan die studente wat hoofsaaklik met teorie in die lesingkamer te make kry.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het ook so lig-gies verwys na die kwessie van die subsidies aan die universiteite waar die studente besonder jolyt gevier het. Onlangs was daar &#x2019;n insident met betrekking tot &#x2019;n draf-broekie. Dit is net stoutigheid aan die kant van die studente en dit sal nie veroorsaak dat subsidies in die gedrang gebring word nie. In daardie geval sal ons dit nie eens oor-weeg nie, want daar gaan dit net oor die kleur en tint van studentwees, oor die &#x2026; [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek sal dit nie verder voer nie, Meneer. &#x2019;n Student was nog nooit &#x2019;n engel nie! Wanneer die student egter aan sekere sake raak wat werklik tot die hart van die gemeenskap dring, dan moet ons waaksaam wees. Ek glo nie die agb. Minister sal baie drastiese stappe doen nie, maar hy moet sy stem dik maak.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Durban-Noord wil h&#x00EA; dat die skolier reeds op die sekond&#x00EA;re vlak moet beweeg na terreine buite sy suiwer kultuur-verband. Hy het dit nou nie bepleit nie, maar hy het dit as &#x2019;n moontlikheid gestel. Hy het ges&#x00EA; &#x2019;n mens kan dit oorweeg. Skoliere op sekond&#x00EA;re vlak is maar baie jong mense. Ek dink die gemiddelde ouderdom in die land van die skolier in matriek is ongeveer 17. In di&#x00E9; verband kan ek op uitsprake van talie mense wys. Daar is byvoorbeeld prof. Mphahlele van die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand wat vir die kultuurgebonden-heid van sy mense pleit. Hy wil hulle nie ge&#x00EF;ntemasionaliseer h&#x00EA; nie. Hy bepleit hul kultuurgebondenheid tot op &#x2019;n baie ryp fase, insluitende die tersi&#x00EA;re vlak. Ek dink die Regering se standpunt daaroor is redelik duidelik en ek wil daardie standpunt onderskryf.</p>

<p>Dan het die agb. lid wat &#x2019;n bekwame lid is, iewers verkeerde inligting gekry toe hy ges&#x00EA; het dat die geskiedenis bewys het dat die Engelssprekendes nie so goed in die onderwys bevorder is nie. Dit is &#x2019;n wilde aantyging. Wie het daardie inligting aan hom verstrek? Sy eie vader staan dan in die onderwys, of hy is terug in die onderwys want hy sal nooit daar wegkom nie. Hy is &#x2019;n skitterende mens vir wie ek ho&#x00EB; waardering het. Ek wil agb. lede die versekering gee dat ons wat in die onderwysw&#x00EA;reld gestaan het, kan getuig dat van ons Engelssprekende kollegas tot op die hoogste vlak skitterend gepresteer het. Die agb. lid sal weet dat dit in Natal ook die geval is. Ek glo nie dit was ooit &#x2019;n probleem nie. Ek wil dit egter saam met die agb. lede bepleit dat die Engelssprekendes aangemoedig sal word om in groter <span class="col_235-236" refersTo="page_0129"/>getalle tot die onderwysberoep toe te tree.</p>

<p>Wat subsidies aan private skole betref, wil ek daarop wys dat Transvaal dit by uitnemendheid doen. Die private skole sou nie kan bestaan en hulle sou nie aan die onderwysers die salarisse kan betaal wat vandag betaal word as daar nie &#x2019;n subsidie aan hulle sou toekom nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Hoofsweep oorkant hartlik bedank. Mnr die Voorsitter, ek kon die agb. lid vir Dur-ban-Noord nog &#x2019;n mooi waarheid vertel het, maar ek wil by &#x2019;n ander gedagte kom.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ons sal moet kyk na sekere ontwikkelinge of tendense in Oos-Transvaal. As ons &#x2019;n driehoek trek van die Oos-Rand na Nelspruit, na Standerton en terug na die Oos-Rand en ons kyk na daardie gebied, dan vind ons dat daar in daardie driehoek meer kapitaal bestee word as in enige land in Afrika. Net aan kragstasies wat vir daardie gebied beplan word, word daar R1,5 miljard bestee, aan Sasol 2 en 3 R6 miljard, aan die ontwikkeling van die Steen-koolbedryf R30 miljard&#x2014;agb. lede kan maar gaan kyk na die verslae wat oor die naweek in ons koerante verskyn het&#x2014;en aan die in-frastruktuur ens., R2 miljard. Oor die volgende vyf jaar sal daar tussen R40 miljard en R50 miljard in Oos-Transvaal bestee word. As ons verwag dat hierdie ontwikkeling sal plaasvind sonder bykomende behoefte aan skole, technikons en miskien selfs &#x2019;n in-genieursfakulteit of &#x2019;n tegniese fakulteit op die tersi&#x00EA;re vlak, maak ons &#x2019;n fout. Die onderwys vra egter eers hoeveel mense met kinders daar is voordat in die behoeftes van die gebied voorsien word. Ander organisasies bring eers die nodige geriewe en infra-struktuur aan en gaan dan met die onderneming voort. Die onderwysersgeriewe kom egter ing voort. Die onderwysgeriewe kom egter eers agtema. Ons moet met beplanning betyds in hierdie geweldige behoefte voorsien wat oor vier tot vyf jaar voor die deur sal staan, &#x2019;n Mens kan nie &#x2019;n skool, &#x2019;n kollege of &#x2019;n technikon oomag oprig nie. Die Swart onderwys is &#x2019;n rukkie gelede by hierdie debat betrek en, waar die betrokke Minister nou ook teenwoordig is, wil ek vir hom s&#x00EA; dat ons ook reeds in hierdie stadium in hierdie behoefte ook moet voorsien. Dit vereis die Oos-Transvaal vandag van ons. Dit is toevallig die gebied waarvandaan ek kom. Dit is die son en die ooste se lig vir almal wat vandag in die Raad sit. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil net &#x2019;n laaste gedagte in u midde laat. Ek wil &#x2019;n saak bepleit met betrekking tot &#x2019;n baie sensitiewe terrein. Ek wil verwys na die Kinderwet-skole van ons land en die kinders wat deur die hof na bepaalde skole gestuur word. In ons land is daar verskeie skole wat hierby betrokke is. Daar is op die oomblik 1 305 seuns en 1 116 dogters in sulke skole. Ek wil kortliks statistiek in di&#x00E9; verband verstrek. By Die Vlakte-skool op Standerton is daar &#x2019;n skoolgebou teen &#x2019;n bedrag van R1,5 miljoen voorsien. Die Direkteur-generaal van die departement het vroe&#x00EB;r vanjaar daardie skool geopen. Op George is daar &#x2019;n meisieskool in aanbou wat R2,7 miljoen gaan kos. By die Tempe-meisieskool in Bloemfontein word daar koste ten bedrae van R3 miljoen aangegaan en vir die seunskool op Queenstown R4,8 miljoen. Daar word dus in totaal R12 miljoen bestee ten behoewe van 2 000 kinders.</p>

<p>Dan kan &#x2019;n mens vra hoekom hierdie geweldige bedrae vir hierdie kinders bestee word. Wie is hierdie kinders? Die kinders in die Kinderwet-skole is kinders wat deur die gemeenskap of die ouerhuis &#x2019;n letsel aange-doen is. As ons wil praat van toegewyde onderwysers, dan is dit die onderwysers wat by daardie skole werk.</p>

<p>Op Standerton is daar drie sulke skole, &#x2019;n seunskool en twee meisieskole. Daar is van daardie kinders wat vandat hulle ingeskryf word totdat hulle die skool verlaat, nooit met vakansie huis toe gaan nie omdat daar vir hulle nie &#x2019;n huis bestaan nie. Hulle word uitgeplaas na mense wat hulle nooi. Hierdie kinders is &#x2019;n juweel in ons gemeenskap. Ek wil die mense in die gemeenskappe in ons land waar sodanige skole gevestig is, versoek <span class="col_237-238" refersTo="page_0130"/>om daardie kinders in hul harte te sluit en hulle in die gemeenskapsaktiwiteite tuis te laat voel. Laat my s&#x00EA; dat een van die top-generaals in ons Weermag in so &#x2019;n skool &#x2019;n skolier was. Ek het saam met die skool-hoofde &#x2019;n bietjie rekord gehou van die prestasies van leerlinge uit daardie skole. Ek kan agb. lede vertel van skitterende prestasies wat deur daardie kinders behaal is op die verpleegterrein, in die onderwys, in die Polisie, in die Weermag en op vakkundige terreine.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Dur-ban-Noord sal hom verbaas. Ek wil dit bepleit dat ons hierdie kinders in ons midde moet opneem en daardie skole deel van die gemeenskap moet maak. Vanjaar het daardie drie klein nywerheidskole vir die eerste keer in hul bestaan op Standerton die inter-ho&#x00EB;rskoolse atletiekbyeenkoms aangebied waarby 11 ho&#x00EB;rskole betrokke was en hulle het dit met groot sukses gedoen. Nou wil ek in dieselfde asem dankie s&#x00EA; aan die kerke, die stadsraad, die Rotari&#x00EA;rklub, die Rapport-ryers en die Lions vir belangstelling in hierdie kinders. Dankie dat u hul &#x2019;n deel maak van ons gemeenskap.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat ons waardering het vir die groot moeite wat die Direk-teur-generaal en sy personeel doen en die groot taak wat hulle verrig ten opsigte van hierdie skole, hierdie soort onderwys en hierdie kinders.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN NASIONALE OPVOEDING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, waar ek nou vir die eerste keer die geleentheid bet om met betrekking tot &#x2019;n Begrotingspos verantwoording te doen, wil ek graag my baie hartlike dank betuig aan almal wat daarvan melding gemaak het. Ek wil graag ook my waardering betuig vir die ernstige en gebalanseerde wyse&#x2014;al was daar hier en daar &#x2019;n effense ideologiese horrelpoot by&#x2014;waarop die debat tot dusver gevoer is.</p>

<p>Die opmerkings van die agb. lid vir Standerton het my besonder geroer toe hy gepraat het oor die kinders in die Kinder-wet-skole. Dit is kinders wat eintlik die geleentheid van &#x2019;n normale gesinslewe onts&#x00EA; word. Meer nog. Dit word hulle op so &#x2019;n wyse onts&#x00EA; dat hulle eintlik gekondisioneer word deur die abnormale en afwykende indruk wat op hulle gemaak word. As &#x2019;n mens in ag neem dat daardie kinders eendag op hul beurt gesinne moet opbou sonder dat hulle uit hul eie ervaring &#x2019;n duidelike model het van hoe &#x2019;n normale gesin funksioneer omdat hulle bloot &#x2019;n inrigtingslewenservar-ing het, dan besef jy hoe hierdie probleem homself eintlik perpetueer as die gemeenskap en mense wat deernis vir hierdie kinders het, nie probeer om in te gryp om hulle die geleentheid te gee om darem blootgestel te word, al is dit dan maar net vir &#x2019;n naweek of &#x2019;n kort vakansie, aan wat dan hopelik as &#x2019;n meer normale gesinslewe beskou kan word nie. Ek wil graag die beroep wat die agb. lid vir Standerton in di&#x00E9; verband op mense gedoen het, van harte onderskryf. Ek dink die gemeenskap moet meer wegkom van die inrigtingsbenadering van kindersorg, en meer klem l&#x00EA; op die pleegsorgbenadering, waar die kind aan &#x2019;n bepaalde gesin gekop-pel word eerder as om altyd maar net aan &#x2019;n inrigting blootgestel te word. Dit verg egter dat mense en gesinne vir hierdie kinders hul huise sal oopstel en hul harte sal oopmaak.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ter inleiding ook verwys na die spore wat ek in my departement en my Ministerie aangetref het wat deur my geagte voorgangers nagelaat is, spore van goeie werk. Ek wil hier in die besonder verwys na my onmiddellike voorganger, mnr. Punt Janson. Ek wil met waardering verwys na die goeie verhoudings wat ek van hom ge&#x00EB;rf het, goeie verhoudings met die verskillende in-stansies waarmee die departement en die Ministerie te doen het, en wat opgebou is danksy die opregtheid en die vriendelike takt en behulpsaamheid waarmee hy hulle benader het. Ek wil ook graag met waardering verwys na dit wat ek van hom ge&#x00EB;rf het in die vorm van diepgaande studies en navorsing met betrekking tot verskillende probleemgebiede. Daar is reeds verwys na die projekverslag van die sogenaamde Venter-ondersoek, altans die eerste deel daarvan. Daar is ook verwys na die RGN se ondersoek in verband met onderwysvoorsiening in die land. Ek kan net terloops s&#x00EA; dat daar verwag word dat hierdie verslag, bestaande uit &#x2019;n hoofverslag en 17 ondersteunende ver-slae, so spoedig doenlik vrygestel sal word en dat die Regering waarskynlik ten minste &#x2019;n voorlopige standpuntstelling in die vorm van &#x2019;n Witskrif saam met die verslag beskikbaar <span class="col_239-240" refersTo="page_0131"/>sal stel ten einde belanghebbende in-stansies die geleentheid te gee om die verslag behoorlik te bestudeer en hul reaksies aan die Regering voor te l&#x00EA; voordat die Regering in meer besonderhede daarop ingaan. Ek het begrip daarvoor dat &#x2019;n mens eintlik graag by geleentheid van hierdie debat die verslag reeds beskikbaar sou h&#x00EA;. As &#x2019;n mens egter in aanmerking neem dat die ondersoek binne &#x2019;n kort jaar voltooi is, wat na my mening &#x2019;n &#x201E;all time record&#x201D; vir so &#x2019;n ondersoek is, dink ek dat dit die Regering nie ten kwade gedui kan word as daar &#x2019;n paar weke vertraging is om die Regering die kans te gee om hierdie uiters omvattende verslag behoorlik te bestudeer nie. Daar is ook &#x2019;n derde belangrike ondersoek wat ek van my voorganger ge&#x00EB;rf het, naamlik die RGN se sportondersoek wat die hele kwessie van sportvoorsiening in die land onder die loep neem.</p>

<p>Waar ek na my onmiddellike voorganger verwys, wil ek graag ook met waardering in herinnering bring hoe ek in my vorige hoedanighede die voorreg gehad het om in mindere of meerdere mate met &#x2019;n hele reeks van bekle&#x00EB;rs van hierdie Ministerie saam te werk en dus, al is dit vanuit &#x2019;n ander hoek, &#x2019;n blik op die probleme van &#x2019;n bekle&#x00EB;r van hierdie soort Ministerie te kry. Ek verwys hier na wyle oom Jan de Klerk, mnr. Johan van der Spuy, ons huidige kollega dr. Koomhof, en mnr. Willem Cruywagen wat nou Administrateur van Transvaal is.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag met &#x2019;n aansienlike mate van weemoed verwys na die uittrede aan die einde van Januarie aanstaande jaar van die huidige Direkteur-generaal, dr. J. T. van Wyk. Ek wil graag baie ho&#x00EB; waardering betuig vir die dienstermyn van meer as 11 jaar wat hy as hoof van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding agter die rug het sedert 1970 toe hy as Sekretaris van die departement aangestel is. Ek wil graag met waardering verwys na sy uiters noukeurige en nougesette werkswyse, sy lojaliteit nie net teenoor die Minister nie maar ook by uitstek teenoor die saak van die onderwys, en die feit dat hy &#x2019;n prinsipieeldenkende amptenaar is. Soos dit in die onderwys as &#x2019;n normatiewe professie verwag kan word, laat hy hom lei deur bepaalde waardes en lewensbeskoulike uitgangspunte in sy benadering tot die onderwys. Dit is interessant om ook daarop te wys dat hy eintlik as ingenieur opgelei is. Ek dink hy het &#x2019;n jaar of twee in die goud-myne verdwaal geraak voordat hy aan die roeping van die onderwys gehoor gegee het. Hierdie opleiding het hom besonder toe-gerus vir die leierskap wat hy in hierdie departement aan die dag moes l&#x00EA; ten opsigte van die uitbou juis van tegniese onderwys.</p>

<p>Ek het kennis geneem van &#x2019;n hele paar mylpale wat onder sy leiding bereik is en ek wil hulle kortliks aanstip. Hy was in die stoel en het &#x2019;n leidende rol gespeel by die formulering van die beginsels en die aanvanklike stappe tot uitvoering van die beginsels van die nasionale onderwysbeleid ingevolge die Wet op die Nasionale Onderwysbeleid van 1967. Hy het ook na afloop van die Van Wyk de Vries-kommissie se ondersoek die leiding geneem met die instelling van die nuwe Adviserende Raad op Universiteite en van &#x2019;n volwaardige tak Universiteitsaange-leenthede in die departement. Hy het &#x2019;n be-sondere rol gespeel om aan die gewese kolleges vir gevorderde tegniese onderwys nuwe status en &#x00ED;nhoud onder die naam &#x201E;technikons&#x201D; te gee en veral om na aanleiding van die Goode-komitee se ondersoek na gevorderde opleiding op die vlak van die sogenaamde Dip. Tech. (die Diploma in Tegnologie) en die Laureatus ingevoer te kry. Ek verwys ook graag na die feit dat die nuwe technikons van die Vaaldriehoek, Port Elizabeth en van die Vrystaat&#x2014;ek het die voorreg om die technikon van die Vrystaat op Vrydag te open&#x2014;onder sy leiding tot stand gekom het. Die S.A. Onderwysersraad vir Blankes en die hele begrip van onderwy-serregistrasie en die professionele status wat daarmee gepaard gaan, is ook iets wat op sy rekening as departementshoof geplaas moet word. Dan is daar die bestuur van die Woor-deboek van die Afrikaanse Taal wat, soos agb. lede sal weet, &#x2019;n baie lang geskiedenis het en wat danksy ons huidige Direkteurgeneraal op &#x2019;n vaster grondslag geplaas is ingevolge &#x2019;n spesiale Wet wat in 1973 deur die Parlement aanvaar is. Hy het ook die leiding geneem met die Wet op Opleiding van Geestelik Vertraagde Kinders van 1974 en ingevolge daardie Wet is daar vandag 42 sentrums in die land vir hierdie minder bevoorregte kinders. Ek wil dus sonder om op verdere besonderhede in te gaan, met baie groot waardering verwys na die voorreg wat die Staat en die gemeenskap in Suid-Afrika gehad het om dr. J. T. van Wyk meer <span class="col_241-242" refersTo="page_0132"/>as 11 jaar lank as hoof van hierdie departement te h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Dan is dit vir my aangenaam om aan te kondig dat dr. P. S. Meyer, die huidige Adjunk-direkteur-generaal, met ingang van 1 Februarie aanstaande jaar as die nuwe Direkteur-generaal aan gestel is. Hy is veral in Kaapland bekend waar hy meer as ses jaar lank Direkteur van Onderwys was, waar hy tevore in die topbestuur van die onder-wysdepartement was en waar hy &#x2019;n skof van 10 jaar as skoolhoof deurgemaak het. Hy het ook wye ervaring opgedoen toe hy gedien het in onderwysbestuursliggame en kulturele liggame soos die Nasionale Kultuurraad en die Kaaplandse Raad vir die Uitvoerende Kunste, KRUIK. Ek het ook destyds met waardering daarvan kennis geneem dat hy ten spyte van sy bestuursverantwoordelik-hede nogtans in 1979 tyd ingeruim het om &#x2019;n proefskrif te voltooi vir die verwerf van &#x2019;n doktorsgraad oor die uiters aktuele onderwerp van gedifferensieerde onderwys in Suid-Afrika. Ek wil by voorbaat vir dr. P. S. Meyer, wat op die oomblik in die buiteland is, juis om &#x2019;n wetenskaplike konferensie oor die onderwerp van sy navorsing toe te spreek, hier in sy nuwe hoedanigheid verwelkom, en waardering uitspreek vir die professionele leiding wat hy aan die departement sal gee.</p>

<p>Nou, mnr. die Voorsitter, wil ek graag in die eerste plek iets s&#x00EA; oor die hele salaris-kwessie, wat die agb. lid vir Pinelands en ver-skeie ander agb. lede aangeraak het. Ek wil h&#x00EA; dat ons hier geen illusies moet h&#x00EA; nie. Ons het eenvoudig in Suid-Afrika, vir sover as wat &#x2019;n mens in die toekoms kan sien, &#x2019;n ernstige tekort aan ho&#x00EB;vlakmannekrag, en waar jy mense as&#x2019;t ware uit die ho&#x00EB;vlakman-nekragpoel na een beroep trek, beteken dit eenvoudig dat jy ander beroepe meer kaal gaan laat. Daar is nie in die voorsienbare toekoms &#x2019;n moontlikheid om hier &#x2019;n drama-tiese verbetering of verandering te bewerkstellig nie. Nogtans is dit my oortuiging&#x2014;en dit was ook die Regering se bedoeling&#x2014;om met die nuwe salarisbedeling vir die onderwys ingevolge die Roux Venter-verslag juis te verseker dat die onderwys, waarvan ons in die verlede belangrike terme soos &#x201E;moederprofessie&#x201D; en &#x201E;sleutelberoep&#x201D; gebruik het, inderdaad sy regmatige deel van hierdie skaars mannekrag sal trek.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag daarop wys dat die nuwe salarisbedeling en die nuwe salarisstruktuur vir die onderwys nie net gesien moet word in terme van &#x2019;n blote salarisverhoging nie. U sal u herinner dat ingevolge die verslag daar &#x2019;n gemiddelde salarisverhoging vir die onderwys van 26&#x0025; gekom het. &#x2019;n Bedrag geld is beskikbaar gestel wat globaal 26&#x0025; meer was as di&#x00E9; van die vorige jaar. Dit is op sigself aansienlike vordering, en dit is ongelukkig al wat baie mense raaksien. Ek wil graag daarop wys dat die werklike goedgekeurde salarisskale uiteindelik gemiddeld 2,7&#x0025; ho&#x00EB;r was as di&#x00E9; wat deur die Roux Venter-verslag voorgestel is, want die Roux Venter-verslag se berekening was gebaseer op &#x2019;n verwagte styging van salarisse in die publieke sektor van 15,2&#x0025;, terwyl dit eintlik net 12,5&#x0025; was. Die salarisse is aangepas op die verwagte verhoging, wat 2,7&#x0025; ho&#x00EB;r was as die werklike verhoging. In hierdie opsig is die onderwys dus nie net gelyk gebring met, en sy agterstand uitgeskakel by vergelykbare poste in die res van die openbare sektor nie, maar is hy in werklikheid reeds &#x2019;n bietjie daarbo uitgelig.</p>

<p>Ek wil in die tweede plek beklemtoon dat hierdie nuwe bedeling naas &#x2019;n verhoging in salarisse ook &#x2019;n nuwe struktuur gebring het. Ek wil hier veral waardering betuig vir die inisiatief wat deur die Kommissie vir Ad-ministrasie aan die dag gel&#x00EA; is, nadat die Regering besluit het om die groot, globale addisionele bedrag beskikbaar te stel, om daarvoor te pleit dat ons nog &#x2019;n bietjie meer tyd daaraan moet bestee ten einde verskillende struktuurverbeterings, wat die professie reeds in vorige jare bepleit het, maar wat weens onvoldoende fondse net nie deurge-voer kon word nie, nou wel deur te voer. Ek verwys hier byvoorbeeld na die feit dat die groot aantal posvlakke verminder is van 10 na 6, dat die toetreerang, waar die onderwy-ser in die klaskamer staan&#x2014;wat eintlik die sleutelpersoon in die professie is&#x2014;verleng is sodat daar vir hom meer vorderingsgeleent-hede geskep kon word, dat die kategorie&#x00EB; op grond van kwalifikasies vanaf die derde posvlak boontoe aansienlik vereenvoudig is deurdat die top kerwe gelykgeskakel is en daar slegs gedifferensieer word op die toe-treekerf, en, les bes, dat die hele plafon van <span class="col_243-244" refersTo="page_0133"/>die onderwysstruktuur gelig is, as gevolg van die Regering se goedkeuring dat die provinsiale Direkteurs van Onderwys moet kom op die vlak van Adjunk-direkteur-generaal, wat beteken dat hulle nou gelykgeskakel word aan die voormalige sekretaris van &#x2019;n departement&#x2014;iets waarvoor daar baie lank gepleit is en wat die hele beweegruimte waarbinne die onderwysstruktuur bepaal kan word, aansienlik vergroot het.</p>

<p>In die derde plek is &#x2019;n belangrike voordeel dat daar nou, danksy die Roux Venter-verslag, &#x2019;n geykte, uitgetoetste vergelykings-instrument, &#x2019;n weegskaal, gekom het om ook vir die toekoms die relatiewe posisie van die onderwysberoep, vergeleke met ander beroepe in die openbare sektor en in die private sektor, te bepaal. Dit was juis een van die probleme in die verlede dat die vergelykings tussen die onderwys en die res van die openbare sektor op &#x2019;n soort van intu&#x00EF;tiewe, subjektiewe beoordelingsgrond gemaak is. Nou is daar, deur poste-evaluasie en die teg-nieke van poste-evaluasie wat in hierdie verslag ontwikkel is, &#x2019;n geykte vergelykingsinstrument geskep wat in die toekoms vir ons en vir die professie beter in staat sal stel om die relatiewe posisie tussen die onderwys en ander poste in die openbare sektor te bly monitor.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek verwys na die feit dat die Regering ook &#x2019;n vaste hersieningsprosedure ten opsigte van die salarisbedeling vir die toekoms goedgekeur het, &#x2019;n hersieningsprosedure wat uiteindelik uitmond in die Komi-tee vir Onderwysstrukture&#x2014;afgekort &#x201E;KOS&#x201D;&#x2014;wat &#x2019;n verteenwoordigende komitee is wat alle dele van die onderwys betrek, sowel die skolesektor as dwarsdeur tot by die tersi&#x00EA;re sektor. Dit is &#x2019;n permanente komitee wat deurlopend sit en wat dus by wyse van antisipasie elke jaar as &#x2019;n normale opdrag aandag moet skenk aan die monitor van die salarisposisie, sodat hy, volgens Tesourie-voorskrifte, eintlik &#x2019;n jaar voor die tyd reeds die nodige insette kan lewer met die oog op die volgende jaar se begroting ten einde te verseker dat die onderwys behoorlik onder die aandag bly wanneer daar aan salarisse aandag geskenk word.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek, ter aansluiting by wat die agb. lid vir Pinelands ges&#x00EA; het, dat ons nie hier met voldaanheid kan gaan sit nie, maar dat dit eintlik net die begin van &#x2019;n regstelling moet wees, daarop wys dat, soos ek in die Persverklaring ná die gedeeltelike begroting aan die begin van die jaar ges&#x00EA; het, die Regering ook te kenne gegee het dat die behandeling van die onderwys ten opsigte van salarisse ook in die toekoms volgens die beginsel van beroepsdifferensiasie sal plaasvind. Met ander woorde, die Regering het erken dat die noodsaak om die onderwys anders te behandel, eiesoortig te behandel, inderdaad hier &#x2019;n inherente element ook van toekomstige hantering moet wees.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Aspek wat nie afgehandel is nie, is die voorstel in die Roux Venter-verslag&#x2014;en dit sluit aan by verskillende agb. lede se opmerkings oor die tekort aan onderwysers in die skaars vakke&#x2014;dat dit volgens hulle nodig sal wees om gedifferensieerde salarisse ten opsigte van die sogenaamde skaars vakke in te voer. Hulle het veral verwys na die natuurwetenskappe, die toegepaste natuurwetenskappe en die sogenaamde bedryfskundige vakke, handwerkvakke. Hierdie beginsel van gedifferensieerde salarisse was tot dusver vir sowel die georganiseerde professie as vir die onderwysdeparte-mente onaanvaarbaar, maar die Roux Venter-verslag het die hele saak op so &#x2019;n indringende wyse beredeneer en sulke oortuigende, nuwe bewysmateriaal na vore ge-bring, dat die Regering besluit het om wel nie in hierdie stadium &#x2019;n besluit oor die saak te neem nie, maar om tog die professie en die onderwysbestuursliggame te vra om weer &#x2019;n keer te kyk na hulle bestaande standpunt teen beroepsdifferensiasie, hetsy by wyse van salaris of by wyse van toelae vir hierdie sogenaamde skaars vakke. Ek wil graag net terloops hier verwys na die agb. lid vir Pinelands se aanvanklike opmerking oor die ho&#x00EB; persentasie persone, blykens die Roux Venter-verslag, wat nie aan die minimum ter-si&#x00EA;re voorgeskrewe onderwyskwalifikasies vir die betrekke vakke waarin hulle onderwys gee, voldoen nie. Ek wil darem daarop wys dat op bladsy 3.3 en 3.4 van die verslag daardie tekorte in groter detail ontleed word. U sal merk dat &#x2019;n groot deel, veral op die prim&#x00EA;reskoolvlak, van die ondergekwalifiseerdheid in sulke vakke l&#x00EA; soos musiek, kuns en kunsopvoeding, lig-gaamlike opvoeding en ander vakke wat nie, sou ek s&#x00EA;, sentrale &#x201C;three-R&#x201D;-vakke is nie&#x2014;met ander woorde, lees, skryf en reken-vakke is nie. Daar is wel ook knelpunte in die basiese vakke, maar die komponent wat <span class="col_245-246" refersTo="page_0134"/>tot hierdie ontstellende persentasie van ondergekwalifiseerdheid bygedra is vanuit die, sal ek s&#x00EA;, nie onmiddellik essensi&#x00EB;le vakke nie, is iets wat &#x2019;n mens darem in die prentjie moet hou. Maar, Meneer, daarmee wil ek nie wegredeneer dat daar inderdaad &#x2019;n sorgwekkende situasie is waarop vorentoe steeds ernstig gelet moet word nie, alhoewel die agb. lid vir Standerton daarop gewys het dat, in die beplanning van die opleiding, onderwysers dikwels verwante opleiding ontvang in vakke anders as hulle eintlike vak, waardeur hulle geskuif kan word in die skool om ook in ander vakke onderrig te gee. Maar die probleem, mnr. die Voorsitter, is dat dit in wiskunde en wetenskap baie moeilik vir iemand is wat nie daarin opgelei is nie om met &#x2019;n bietjie aanpassing oor te skakel van, byvoorbeeld, geskiedenis of taal na wiskunde of wetenskap. Dit is in daardie vakke waar die fundamentele opleiding juis van groot belang is en waarom, dus, die Roux Venter-verslag se aanbeveling van die gedifferensieerde salarisse iets is wat vorentoe weer ernstige aandag moet geniet.</p>

<p>Les bes wil ek daarop wys dat daar ook regstellings ten opsigte van anomalie&#x00EB; wat uit die Roux Venter-verslag voortgevloei het, deur die verskillende onderwysower-hede aanbeveel is by die Ko&#x00F6;rdinerende Komitee vir Onderwysstrukture (KOS), en dat dit in die loop van sake&#x2014;sommige reeds aanstaande jaar, sommige in die jaar daarna&#x2014;deur die owerhede oorweeg sal word. Daar is geen illusie dat hierdie verslag nou met &#x2019;n towerstaf skielik &#x2019;n nuwe bedeling gebring het waaraan daar in die toekoms nooit weer aandag geskenk sal moet word nie. Daar is, veral ook van die kant van die universiteite op die vlak van senior lektore, bepaalde argumente na vore gebring waardeur daar betoog is dat die evaluering van daardie pos nie tot sy reg gekom het in die uiteindelik goedgekeurde salarisstrukture nie. Maar ek moet tog daarop wys dat, selfs wat die universiteite betref, die werklike persentasieverhoging wat hulle ontvang het, heelwat ho&#x00EB;r is as die gemiddeld van 15,9&#x0025;&#x2014;teenoor die 26&#x0025; vir die skole&#x2014;wat in die verslag aanbeveel is. Die persentasies wissel van 18&#x0025; in die geval van &#x2019;n professor, tot meer as 30&#x0025; in die geval van &#x2019;n junior lektor. Ek wil weer daarop wys dat daar waardering is vir bepaalde probleme wat in die toekoms weer aandag sal moet geniet&#x2014;nie net op universiteitsvlak nie, maar ook op die vlak van die skole.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ook by agb. lede aansluit met betrekking tot die waardering wat hulle betuig het vir die gesindheid van samewer-king, ten spyte van vasberade en dikwels taai onderhandelinge, wat ook ek ervaar het met die verteenwoordigers van die georganiseerde professie, en veral die top manne van die Federale Raad van Onderwysersverenig-ings. Hulle is mense wat sterk en beslis op hulle standpunt staan, maar ek is vol waardering vir die positiewe gesindheid waardeur ons, selfs wanneer ons nog bly verskil het, met mekaar saam kon vorentoe loop om, al is dit dan op &#x2019;n effens verskillende wyse, die beste belang van die onderwysprofessie te probeer bevorder. Ek het reeds daarna verwys, maar ek wil ook weer s&#x00EA;dat ek baie groot waardering het vir die begrip, die in-isiatief en die reuse-arbeidsinset wat van die kant van die Kommissie vir Administrasie gekom het toe hierdie nuwe salarisbedeling onder baie groot tvdsdruk aan die begin van die jaar bewerkstellig is. En daarmee saam wil ek verwys na die verskillende onderwys-departemente wat met die oog op spoedige implementering van die onderwyssalarisse reeds in Apnlmaand, werklik reusewerk gelewer het.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek het probeer vas-stel wat die vergelykende posisie ten opsigte van bedankings, vakatures en werwing vanjaar is vergeleke met verlede jaar. Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het die vraag aan my gestel, maar ek kon ongelukkig nog nie enige werklik betroubare syfers kry nie. Die enigste terugvoering wat ek gekry het van die onder-wysdepartemente en ook van die georganiseerde professie, is dat hulle in hierdie stadium geen ernstige probleme ervaar nie, dat daar geen verdere verslegting is nie en dat daar volop tekens is van terugkeer na die onderwysprofessie van mense wat die professie verlaat het. Ek kon egter geen betroubare, gekwantifiseerde beeld hiervan vind nie. Ek is jammer dat ek nie hier meer behulpsaam kan wees nie. My indruk is egter dat daar &#x2019;n positiewe gesindheid in die professie is, dat die professie rustig voortgaan, dat dit gemotiveerd is, maar&#x2014;en dit wil ek baie sterk beklemtoon&#x2014;dit wag ook vir die tweede deel van die Roux/ Venter-verslag, die deel oor die kwaliteit van die werklewe van die onderwyser, wat <span class="col_247-248" refersTo="page_0135"/>veral sal toespits op die organisatoriese en administratiewe klimaat waarbinne hy werk en die mate van professionele outonomie wat hy geniet. Hierdie aangeleentheid, het ek gehoop, sou voor die einde van die jaar voltooi wees, maar die indringende menings-opname wat die loodskomitee nodig ag om &#x2019;n werklik betroubare opname te kry, gaan, so lyk dit vir my, die ondersoek moontlik tot langer as die einde van die jaar laat duur. Maar, mnr. die Voorsitter, wat ek graag wil h&#x00EA;, is nie &#x2019;n blote voorlopige opname nie. Ek wil graag indien moontlik &#x2019;n moeilik weerlegbare bewyslewering kry sodat, net soos in die geval van die onderwysers se salarisse, ons ook wat betref probleme op die administratiewe gebied&#x2014;die sogenaamde &#x201E;rompslomp&#x201D;-gebied, soos die onderwys dit so graag noem&#x2014;en die kwessie van professionele outonomie, &#x2019;n duidelike diagnose kan kry met onweerlegbare aanduidings van presies hoe die saak staan, sodat dit nie maklik van die tafel gevee kan word met teen-argumente nie. Daarom dink ek is daar &#x2019;n bietjie ekstra tyd nodig.</p>

<p>Intussen wil ek dit graag aan die Komitee noem dat ek ook &#x2019;n geleentheid gehad het om sekere probleme wat in daardie opname oor die kwaliteit van die werklewe reeds ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer is, onder die aandag van die Administrateurs en die Direkteurs van Onderwys te bring om regstellings te maak waar ek meen dat daar onbevredigende sit-uasies heers. In die eerste plek is daar &#x2019;n ernstige knelling met die administratiewe beslommemis verbonde aan die oordra van &#x2019;n persoon se diensverpligting wat hy teenoor een departement het op grond van beurse wat hy vir opleiding gekry het of salaris wat hy tydens milit&#x00EA;re diensplig ontvang het, indien hy dan oorgaan na &#x2019;n ander onderwysdepartement, veral as hy in &#x2019;n tydelike hoedanigheid na die ander onderwysdepartement oorgaan. Ek kan vir u s&#x00EA; dat dit &#x2019;n ontsettend ingewikkelde administratiewe prosedure was waaraan mense onderhewig was, en dit het nie voorsiening gemaak vir persone wat in &#x2019;n tydelike hoedanigheid oor-gegaan het nie. Neem die voorbeeld van &#x2019;n vrou uit Johannesburg wat die fout sou maak om met &#x2019;n Kapenaar te trou en dan hierheen te verhuis en hier &#x2019;n tydelike pos te kry&#x2014;as sy so gelukkig kan wees, want sulke poste is so skaars soos hoendertande hier in die Wes-Kaap. As sy &#x2019;n tydelike pos kry, is sy onmiddellik onder &#x2019;n verpligting om haar beurs terug te betaal by die vorige departement, terwyl sy in feite hier voortgaan met onderwys. Ons het gelukkig nou daarin geslaag om, in samewerking met die Tesourie en die Kommissie vir Administrasie, hierdie probleem ten minste vir die toekoms vanaf 1 Oktober uitgestryk te kry.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Tweede probleem is die feit dat die onderwyser nie alleen tyd nie, maar dikwels ook &#x2019;n klomp geld bestee aan buite-kurrikul&#x00EA;re aktiwiteite, op die sportveld, op kultuurgebied, ens. Dit is nou goedgekeur dat, uit die skoolfonds of uit &#x2019;n spesiale trustfonds wat die ouers by &#x2019;n bepaalde skool vir di&#x00E9; doel kan daarstel, die onderwysers behoorlike kompensasie kan ontvang vir hierdie lopende uitgawes. Hulle kan natuurlik formeel eis vir reis-en verblyftoelaes, maar in die geval van kleiner uitgawes, soos wanneer jy &#x2019;n klompie kinders tee gee terwyl jy hulle neem om te gaan voetbal speel, of as jy hulle gou in jou bakkie oplaai as daar nie vir hulle plek in die skoolbus is nie, ens., hoop ons nou dat hierdie probleem vlotter en op &#x2019;n plaaslike grondslag opgelos sal kan word, sonder dat daar na die departement se hoofkwartier gegaan moet word. Ek dink dat dit ook &#x2019;n klomp irritasies uit die weg sal ruim, vir &#x2019;n baie hoog waardeerde diens wat die onderwyser buitekant die klaskamer lewer.</p>

<p>I think we have been taking the teacher for granted on the playing field and in activities such as operetta training, and we are not entitled to take any teacher for granted. I sincerely hope that this possibility which now exists for compensating teachers for out of pocket expenses will be made use of by the parent community, in order to show their appreciation of what the teachers are actually doing.</p>

<p>In respect of the recruiting of teachers abroad, we have discussed with the Administrators and the Directors of Education the possibility of facilitating the assessment of qualifications gained abroad in order to equate them with South African qualifications. I should make it very clear that there is no question of treating foreign applicants more favourably, in terms of appointment in South Africa, than our own people. The normal requirements for recruitment and for selection of applicants from abroad <span class="col_249-250" refersTo="page_0136"/>will be as strict as those for recruitment internally. I think, however, that we have succeeded in facilitating the evaluation of the qualifications of teachers from abroad.</p>

<p>Finally, the position of the married woman is one for which I have very great sympathy. Our whole educational structure would collapse if we did not have not only the dedication but in many cases also the very superior qualifications and ability of the married women, especially in the classroom. Generally it seems that they are not so much interested in the more managerial positions in the department, but particularly in the actual classroom situation.</p>

<p>The probleem here is that especially two of the provinces have been rather generous in appointing married women even on a permanent basis. I refer here particularly to Natal and the Transvaal. But the moment you appoint married women on a permanent basis, you rather tie down the mobility of the teaching force, because the married woman is tied to the place where her husband is working, and she cannot always readily respond in a positive way to appeals from the province for transfers on a secondment basis to other schools where there may be a shortage or a vacancy due to study leave, etc. I have in fact discussed this matter in some depth with the Director of Education for Natal, and he spelt out to my satisfaction a number of problems that they have encountered because they have perhaps gone too far, according to him, in the percentage of posts assigned to married women for permanent appointment. It is, however, a fact that the proposals for co-ordinated policy in respect of reserving a certain percentage of posts on the primary or the secondary level for appointment of unmarried women or of men have not been properly co-ordinated by the Committee of Heads of Education in the past, and therefore the implementation of these recommendations happened on a basis which led to apparent discrimination or anomalies amongst the different provinces. 1 have now asked the Committee of Heads of Education to finalize this matter and to properly co-ordinate the proposals that have been made, about two years ago, and I hope that in this way we will iron out the difficulties of different standards being applied in respect of the appointment of married women.</p>

<p>I should also like to remind the Committee, Mr. Chairman, of the fact that though the Roux Venter report pointed out very clearly that in terms of the cold logic by which they worked, women should not receive the same salary in education as men, the discrepancy between the salary received by professional female teachers compared with comparable positions in the rest of the public sector is not so serious as that in the case of the positions of male teachers. The Government decided not to accept the recommendation of the Roux Venter report to continue the discrimination in salary between men and women, but it decided to move further towards parity in salaries for men and women. In fact, it included a further post level, which had previously not been on a parity basis, so as to indicate its move towards achieving parity. This, of course, will cost quite a large amount when it is fully implemented&#x2014;which I hope it will be in the near future.</p>

<p>I should very briefly like to refer to the question of salaries at the teachers&#x2019; colleges. I have tried to avoid a public debate on this matter, but I would like to say that I am quite willing to give the information to the hon. member. I have discussed this matter in depth with the Federal Council. We agreed to differ on this matter, but I think it would be in the interests of the teaching profession if we were not to discuss this matter across the floor. I shall, however, give the hon. member for Pinelands full details of this matter. I can say that I have informed my colleagues on this side of the House of the position. They are well informed, and I am also quite willing to give the hon. member for Durban North the necessary information. In fact, I could say that the members of teachers&#x2019; training colleges whose so-called entrenched position was abandoned, still receive a very, very handsome basic increase in salary. It is only that they lost, I think, a bit of the cherry on the top of the cake.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I should like to clarify one matter. This is that the De Lange report, the Human Sciences Research Council report, will not concern itself with salaries or conditions of service. This was expressly excluded at the time of its assignment, in view of the fact that the Roux Venter Committee, although dealing only with the White teachers, had already been given a full assignment <span class="col_251-252" refersTo="page_0137"/>on the question of salaries and conditions of service.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is wat ek graag wou s&#x00EA; in verband met salarisse. Laat my toe om nou oor die Begrotingspos self enkele opmerkings te maak. Ek wil graag verwvs daarna dat die vermeerdering in die Pos in totaal op 25,7&#x0025; neerkom. As &#x2019;n mens in aanmerking neem dat die groei in die Begroting in die geheel 16,8&#x0025; is&#x2014;of, soos die agb. Minister van Finansies ges&#x00EA; het, as jy Verdediging uitsluit, 14,5&#x0025;&#x2014;dan is daar ook by hierdie departement se onderwysak-tiwiteite, wat met die Blanke bevolkingsgroep te doen het, &#x2019;n baie aansienlike bewys van die ems van die Regering met die ho&#x00EB; prioriteit van onderwys sigbaar. Ek wil graag &#x2019;n paar van die programme uitsonder waar die verhoging nog ho&#x00EB;r is as die gemiddeld van die Pos van die departement as geheel. Ek verwys hier na Program 3&#x2014;Beroepsonderwys, wat veral te doen het met die technikons en die tegniese kolleges, waar die vermeerdering 40,6&#x0025; is. Dan is daar Program 6&#x2014;Kultuurbevordering, waar die verhoging 29&#x0025; is. Verder kan ek met besondere vreugde daarop wys dat die vermeerdering ten opsigte van die rade vir uitvoerende kunste 44,1&#x0025; is, terwyl die Buro vir Wetenskaplike Publikasies, wat &#x2019;n landswye poging aanwend om wetenskaplike navorsingsresultate van Suid-Afrika in eie wetenskaplike tydskrifte te publiseer, &#x2019;n vermeerdering van 40,7&#x0025; toon. In die program: Ondersteunende en Verwante Dienste, wat &#x2019;n baie wye spektrum dek, soos agb. lede in die begrotingsdokument sal sien, is die verhoging byna 32&#x0025;. Dit sluit in die Raad vir Geesteswetenskaplike Navorsing, as &#x2019;n outonome liggaam, waar die vermeerdering 41,8&#x0025; is. Dit is die gevolg van die aanbeveling van die Wetenskaplike Adviesraad van die Eerste Minister, wat die belangrikheid van geesteswetenskaplike navorsing in hierdie opsig sterk beklemtoon het. Dan is daar Program No. 8&#x2014;Sportbevordering, waar ons &#x2019;n vermeerdering van 27,2&#x0025; gewaar.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag beklemtoon dat die relatief gunstiger toename, vergeleke met die gemiddeld van die departement, by sportbevordering en kultuurbevordering ook gesien moet word in die lig van die feit dat die Regering sport en kuituur as &#x2019;n baie belangrike deel van ons totale strategie teen die totale aanslag teen die land beskou. Ek dink nie dit is nodig om dit in besonderhede uit te spel nie. Ek wil terloops net daarop wys dat as ons, wat sportbevordering betref, &#x2019;n bietjie in die begrotingsdokument rondsnuffel, ons merk dat die Weermag alleen in Begrotingspos 19 R2,1 miljoen aan sport bestee, terwyl ook die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling en die afdeling Gevangenisse aansienlike bedrae aan sport bestee. Om &#x2019;n volle beeld te kry van wat die Regering werklik ten opsigte van die instellings en die aktiwiteite aan hierdie departement verbonde, bestee, moet ons ook let op die bedrae wat onder Pos 23&#x2014;Gemeenskapsontwikkeling vir hierdie doel aangewend word.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek graag, na aanleiding hiervan, iets s&#x00EA; in verband met die bedrag vir beroepsonderwys wat, soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, &#x2019;n toename van 40,6&#x0025; behels. Hierdie uitbreiding geld veral, soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, vir tegniese onderwys, die agt technikons, insluitende die nuwe Vrystaatse Technikon wat Vrydag formeel geopen word, en die 28 tegniese kolleges en 41 tegniese institute. In die geval van die technikons is die vermeerdering in besteding feitlik 45&#x0025; wat, so meen ek, &#x2019;n baie duidelike aanduiding is van hoe belang-rik die Regering hierdie sektor van onderwys ag. Daardie groei is veral op die gebied van kapitaalvoorsiening, wat op sig-self geneem &#x2019;n groei van byna 74&#x0025; op ver-lede jaar aandui. Dit is kapitaal wat voorsien is met die oog op die nuwe kampusse vir die technikons hier in Kaapstad, in Durban, in Johannesburg en in Pretoria, wie se kampusse vir baie jare vertraag is as gevolg van ekonomiese omstandighede, en ek dink ook as gevolg van die prioriteit wat die universiteite in daardie stadium geniet het. Daarby wil ek wys op &#x2019;n belangrike maar beskeie R100 000 vir praktykgerigte navorsing as &#x2019;n nuwe komponent in die finansiering van die technikons, wat onder andere dien ter onderskraging van die nuwe gevorderde kursusse wat aan die technikons ingestel is, die Dip. Tech en die Laureatus. Na my mening is die technikons besig om &#x2019;n baie belangrike volwaardige posisie langs die universiteite op die tersi&#x00EA;re vlak in te neem. Tot dusver is hulle taamlik regstreeks onder beheer van die departement bestuur. Alhoewel hulle hulle eie rade het, is hulle nogtans, wat betref nasionale beleid, betreklik regstreeks <span class="col_253-254" refersTo="page_0138"/>onder departementele beheer geplaas. Na my mening verg hulle posisie &#x2019;n meer ge&#x00EB;-mansipeerde beheerstruktuur. Tydens samesprekings met die voorsitters van die rade van die technikons en verteenwoordigers van hulle direkteure verlede week, het ek met hulle daaroor gesels dat die technikons met voorstelle moet kom sodat hulle, soos die universiteite deur die Komitee van Universiteitshoofde en die Adviserende Raad op Universiteite, ook &#x2019;n meer ge&#x00EB;mansipeerde beheerstruktuur sal kry wat hulle in &#x2019;n meer volwaardige posisie op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak sal plaas.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ook verwys na die algemene aandrang op meer tegniesgeskoolde man-nekrag, soos dit, onder andere, onlangs in die verslag van die Nasionale Mannekrag-kommissie oor ho&#x00EB;vlak-mannekrag na vore gekom het. Dit is noodsaaklik dat formele onderwys, d.w.s. onderwys op ons skole en op ons kolleges, &#x2019;n sterker beroepsgerigte inslag moet kry. Dit is &#x2019;n punt wat agb. lede reeds gemaak het. Ons moet erken dat ons formele onderwys sterk akademies geӧrienteerd is, miskien omdat ons dink dat alge-meenvormende onderwys alleen goeie alge-meenvormende onderwys kan wees as dit akademies ge&#x00F6;rienteerd is. Die opvoedkundiges het egter in die jongste tyd vir ons uitgewys dat algemeenvormende onderwys ook goeie vormende onderwys kan wees as dit meer beroepsge&#x00F6;rienteerd is. Daarom is ek daarvan oortuig dat ons ook op die skoolvlak &#x2019;n groter toespitsing op beroepsge&#x00F6;rien-teerde onderwys en op voorligting, soos van die agb. lede reeds genoem het, met die oog op beroepsge&#x00F6;rienteerde onderrig, moet kry. Ek is seker dat as dit gebeur, die onder-bou vir onderwys op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak ook stewiger sal wees. Dit is egter ook belangrik dat ons die noodsaak van die uitbou van nie-formele onderwys wat in noue samewerking met die beroepsituasie plaasvind, sal beklemtoon. Ek verwys hier na die verslag waarvan die agb. lid vir Pinelands gepraat het, naamlik die verslag oor &#x201C;Post-school Education&#x201D;. Dit is &#x2019;n departementele verslag wat binne die departement popul&#x00EA;r bekend is as die Naud&#x00E9;-verslag. Dit is &#x2019;n verslag van &#x2019;n komitee onder voorsitterskap van mnr. Steve Naud&#x00E9; wat toespits op tegniese onderwys op naskoolse vlak, met beperkte aandag aan die technikons en met uitsluiting van universiteite. Met ander woorde, dit is veral toegespits op die tegniese kolleges en tegniese institute. Die nuwe wetsontwerp i.v.m. die tegniese kolleges waarvan nou in die Raad kennis gegee is, is &#x2019;n voortvloeisel uit die aanbevelings vervat in daardie verslag.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It is a departmental report and I shall consider the possibility of making it available.</p>

<p>I should also like to emphasize in this connection the importance of contributions by the private sector, especially in the area of non-formal career-orientated and technical education. The effort required in this area will be far beyond the financial means of the Treasury alone. I am sure that the direct advantages accruing from it to the private sector are such that it justifies a very considerable involvement on the part of the private sector in building up career-orientated education in the technical colleges and also in assisting in making it practical in the school situation. It is very important that career orientation should take place in close interaction between the normal teaching situation and the experience that the students could gain through some exposure to the job situation. A kind of sandwich combination should be introduced as far as feasible and as widely as possible.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag aansluit by &#x2019;n punt wat die agb. lid vir Pinelands asook die agb. lid vir Durban-Noord geopper het, naamlik die kwessie van oop universiteite of oop technikons. Ek wil dit hier baie duidelik stel dat die Regering sy beleid handhaaf dat daar ook eie tersi&#x00EA;re inrigtings vir elke bevolkingsgroep voorsien moet word en dat hy hom nie stel op die standpunt van ongekwalifiseerde oopstelling van hierdie inrigtings nie. Die Regering het dit in sy Witskrif met kommentaar op die aanbevelings van die Nasionale Mannekragkommis-sie oor ho&#x00EA;vlak-mannekrag, reeds gestel. Terselfdertyd erken die Regering dat op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak, soos die agb. lid vir Durban-Noord eintlik ook te kenne gegee het, ook ander faktore as net kultuurgebondenheid, wat ten opsigte van die sekond&#x00EA;re en pri-m&#x00EA;re vlak van oorheersende belang is, na <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0139"/>vore kom. Daarom het die Regering reeds baie jare in die lig van hierdie ander faktore ingestem tot &#x2019;n gekwalifiseerde toelating van lede van alle bevolkingsgroepe tot technikons of universiteite. Ek verwys hier veral na die behoefte nie net om wetenskaplike redes nie, maar ook om rede van tussen-kulturele stimulusse wat op die nagraadse vlak van gevorderde kursusse ervaar word, in welke geval daar geredelik toegang is tussen universiteite en technikons van die verskillende bevolkingsgroepe, en in die tweede plek die geval van kursusse wat nie aan die eie inrigting van die betrokke bevolkingsgroep waartoe die student behoort, voorsien word nie. Soos in die Witskrif oor die verslag oor ho&#x00EB;vlak-mannekrag verklaar is, is die Regering bereid om veral met die oog op behoeftes van ho&#x00EB;vlak-mannekrag aandag te skenk aan die hersiening en verbetering van prosedures van toelating. Dit word tans ook deur die verskillende departemente gedoen. Die ervaring het in sommige opsigte uitgewys dat daar stremminge en hindemisse is wat sonder om die saak te verongeluk, hersien kan word. Die oorweldigende getuienis van sowel Swart as Bruin opvoedkundige leiers is egter ten gunste van die noodsaak van gemeenskapsgerigte universiteite en gemeenskapsgerigte technikons. Met ander woorde, selfs di&#x00E9; van hulle wat pleit vir die oopstelling van inrigtings op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak en die vrye keuse van toegang, beklemtoon die noodsaak van universiteite en technikons wat gerig is op die besondere behoeftes van &#x2019;n spesifieke bevolkingsgroep. Toe ek aanvanklik voorsitter was van wat uiteindelik bekend geword het as die Retiefkomitee i.v.m. die voorsiening van tersi&#x00EA;re onderwysgeriewe vir Swartes buite die nasionale State, het dit my byvoorbeeld opgeval hoe selfs van die mees militante leiers uit Soweto sterk standpunt ingeneem het teenoor verteenwoordigers van die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand dat hulle nie tevrede sal wees met &#x2019;n universiteit wat bloot as satelliet van die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand daar gestig word nie, maar dat hulle &#x2019;n eie universiteit vir Soweto wil h&#x00EA;. Ek voeg weer by dat van hulle wel oopstelling wil h&#x00EA;, maar die prim&#x00EA;re punt is die gemeenskapsgerigte fokus waarop hierdie leiers aanspraak maak. Ek wil die agb. Komitee ook wys op die natuurlike strewe, amper tot die punt van oorgretigheid, van onafhanklike state wanneer hulle onafhanklik word om amper as eerste saak wat hulle nastreef &#x2019;n eie universiteit as &#x2019;n kragsentrale vir hulle gemeenskap, vir hulle kultuurlewe daar te stel. Ek wil graag s&#x00EA; daar is sekere fundamentele behoeftes wat deur &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapsgerigte universiteit of technikon bevredig word. In die eerste plek, soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, vorm dit &#x2019;n kragsentrale, meer as net &#x2019;n intellektuele kragsentrale, &#x2019;n kulturele en maatskaplik ontwikkelende kragbron vir die eie gemeenskap. Dit is ook, in die tweede plek, in staat om beter toe te spits op eiesoortige studie probleme en aanpassings- probleme wat student in &#x2019;n ontwikkelende gemeenskap ervaar. Hierdie saak is baie sterk beklemtoon in die getuienis voor die Retief-komitee. Daar is ges&#x00EA; dat dit vir &#x2019;n student embarrasserend is om in &#x2019;n oorwegend Blanke universiteit remedi&#x00EB;rende kursusse te volg terwyl dit vir hom heel normal en gewoon en ook aanvaarbaar is in &#x2019;n universiteit waarin sy eie bevolkingsgroep die oorwegende studentegetal uitmaak. Ek verwys ook na &#x2019;n opmerking wat &#x2019;n gewaardeerde oudkollega van my, dr. Van der Ross, onlangs voor die Afrikaanse Sakeka-mer in Kaapstad gemaak het. Ek verwys na &#x2019;n berig in <i>Die Burger</i> van verlede Vrydag waarvolgens dr. Van der Ross daarop gewys het dat die, wat hy genoem het, apartheid-suniversiteit van dr. Verwoerd se tyd wat die Kleurling betref, ho&#x00EB;ronderwys binne die bereik van duisende mense gebring het wat dit nie anders in di&#x00E9; kort tyd sou kon bekom het nie. Hy het gewys hoe daar in besonder wat betref probleme van voertaal, maatskap-like aanpassing en kostestruktuur deur hierdie universiteite &#x2019;n unieke en noodsaaklike diens gelewer is en inderdaad moes word wat nie deur die oorwegend Blanke universiteite gelewer kon word nie. Ek wil dit ook beklemtoon dat in my eie ervaring as lid van die Universiteitsraad van Fort Hare dit my telkens weer getref het hoe traumaties die maatskaplike aanpassings probleme van die Swart student is wanneer hy op universiteit kom, selfs op Fort Hare, waar hy tussen sy eie mense tuis is. Dit is vir hom &#x2019;n baie groot sprong. Dit geld nie net die landelike student nie, maar ook die stedelike student. Hierdie maatskaplike aanpassings wat uiteraard uiteindelik ook &#x2019;n groter invloed op die wat in &#x2019;n universiteit wat op &#x2019;n eie bevolkingsgroep <span class="col_257-258" refersTo="page_0140"/>toegespits is, baie beter tot sy reg kan kom.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook verwys na &#x2019;n argument wat ek al voorheen gehoor het, naamlik dat daar dan le&#x00EB; fasiliteite by die Blanke universiteite sou wees en dat met die groot ontploffing van getalle van nie-Blankes dit meer verantwoordelik sou wees om daardie le&#x00EB; fasiliteite te gebruik as om nuwes te skep. Ek dink die agb. Minister van Onderwys en Opleiding het di&#x00E9; argument ook moes aanhoor toe hy die Wetsontwerp op die Universiteit Vista verdedig het. Ek wil net graag die Komitee daarop wys dat die aanvrae deur Blanke universiteite vir kapitaalmagtiging vir uitbreiding van fasiliteite vanjaar baie meer was as in die afgelope twee of drie jaar. Dit wys &#x2019;n mens dat al is die groeipotensiaal van die Blanke universiteite ongetwyfeld besig om af te plat, daar nie stagnasie aan die ontwikkel is met gevolglik &#x2019;n klomp le&#x00EB; fasiliteite nie. Ek wil dit as my oortuiging stel dat die groei van Swart getalle wat op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak gaan plaasvind&#x2014;ek dink die agb. lid vir DurbanNoord het dit baie duidelik uitgespel&#x2014;gaan meer Swart fasiliteite vereis selfs indien die ander universiteite oop sou wees en dit is dus uiters noodsaaklik dat ons ons daarop moet toespits. Wat hierdie saak betref, wil ek afsluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat dit uiters onverantwoordelik sou wees as &#x2019;n ongekwalifiseerde oopstelling van universiteite en technikons sou plaasvind wat hierdie noodsaaklike voordele van eie inrigtings vir die betrokke gemeenskappe sou ondermyn of verswak. Daarom staan die Regering by sy beleid soos wat ek dit aan die Komitee gestel het.</p>

<p>Laat my net nog &#x2019;n opmerking maak na aanleiding van wat oor die technikons ges&#x00EA; is. Agb. lede sal opmerk dat daar &#x2019;n aansien-like vermeerdering van besteding ten opsigte van die technikons is. Ek wil graag na aanleiding daarvan s&#x00EA; dat dit nie beteken dat daar nou &#x2019;n geringskatting kom van die rol van die universiteite in die tersi&#x00EA;re sektor nie. Die universiteit bly, soos die Van Wyk de Vries-kommissie dit destyds gestel het, in die o&#x00EB; van die Regering en volgens die oortuiging van die Regering, die leier van die hele onderwysstruktuur. Hy is die senior in daardie verband. Daarom is dit dan ook dat teenoor die beskeie R100 000 wat vanjaar vir navorsing in die technikons beskikbaar gestel word, die bedrag wat aan die universiteite vir navorsing beskikbaar gestel word, in die orde van R10 miljoen is. Die kapitaal wat vanjaar vir die technikons beskikbaar gestel word, is ten spyte van die feit dat dit &#x2019;n groot vermeerdering op die verlede is, nog maar die helfte van die kapitaal wat in totaal vir die universiteite beskikbaar gestel word. Alhoewel die technikons dus meer tot hul reg kom, beteken dit nie dat die universiteite daardeur verwaarloos word nie. Ek wil dit hier as my oortuiging beklemtoon dat die universiteit &#x2019;n unieke funksie het wat deur geen ander inrigting in die samelewing vervul kan word nie omdat hy drie uiters moeilike kennisfunksies kombineer. Daar is geen ander inrigting wat dit in di&#x00E9; mate kombineer nie. In die eerste plek is daar die oordrag van kennis of onderwys, en in die tweede plek, maar saam daarmee, is daar die vind van nuwe kennis of navorsing. Daar moet interaksie tussen die twee wees. Dit is nie &#x2019;n kwessie dat die een op voorgraadse vlak gedoen word en die ander op nagraadse vlak nie. In die derde plek is daar die toepassing van kennis om probleme van die samelewing op te los. Hierdie drie funksies, die oordrag van kennis, die vind van nuwe kennis en die toepassing van daardie kennis, in gedurige interaksie met mekaar uitgeoefen, maak na my mening die wesenskenmerk van die universiteit in terme van &#x2019;n kennisdefinisie uit. Dit stel egter dan ook baie ho&#x00EB; eise van veelsydige vermo&#x00EB;ns en van besondere intellektuele begaafdheid aan die mense wat deur &#x2019;n universiteit gewerf moet word. Hiermee sal steeds rekening gehou moet word, onder andere by die evaluering van universiteitsposte met die oog op die vasstel van salarisstrukture wat reg laat geskied aan universiteite se status.</p>

<p>Ek wil nog &#x2019;n punt oor universiteite opper. Ek meen di&#x00E9; punt is ook deur die agb. lid vir Pinelands sowel as die agb. lid vir Virginia genoem. Die punt is miskien net in die verbygaan genoem, maar ek dink dit ls baie belangrik. Ek verwys na die kwessie van die subsidieformule en die twyfel wat daar by baie mense is oor die doeltreffendheid van die seleksieproses van universiteite ten opsigte van die toelating van studente. Ek kan die Komitee meedeel dat blykens same-sprekings wat ek &#x2019;n paar weke gelede met lede van die Komitee van Universiteitshoofde gehad het, daar kommer by die Komitee van Universiteitshoofde bestaan oor die doeltreffendheid van die seleksieproses <span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_0141"/>van universiteitstoelating. Daar is twee redes hiervoor. Die eerste is dat die persentasie van die Blanke ouderdomsgroep wat universiteitstoelating, d.w.s. matnkulasie in die letterlike sin van die woord, verwerf, in die afgelope 15 jaar toegeneem het van 14&#x0025; na 28&#x0025;. Op die oomblik is dit waarskynlik effens meer as 30&#x0025;. Dit is ver meer as die persentasie in enige ontwikkelde land. Daar is dus bloot in die ho&#x00EB; persentasie wat uit die skoolmateriaal vir universiteitstoelating geselekteer word, alreeds, wil ek s&#x00EA;, &#x2019;n gevaarliggie wat flits. In die tweede plek het die Komitee van Universiteit-shoofde by wyse van loodsondersoeke vas-gestel dat &#x2019;n baie klein persentasie van di&#x00E9; mense wat universiteitstoelating met &#x2019;n gemiddelde punt van 50&#x0025; of laer verwerf&#x2014;agb. lede weet natuurlik dat universiteitstoelating met &#x2019;n gemiddelde punt van 45&#x0025; verwerf kan word&#x2014;ooit daarin slaag om &#x2019;n graad selfs in die minimum tyd plus 2 jaar ekstra tyd te verwerf. Die vraag is of om aan sulke studente deur die seleksieproses die indruk te gee dat hulle op universiteit kan slaag, &#x2019;n verantwoorde belegging van privaatfondse meebring en, in die tweede plek, of dit &#x2019;n billike verwagting by daardie kandidate skep dat hulle &#x2019;n redelike kans het om op universiteit te slaag. Die Komitee van Universiteitshoofde is besig om indringend te kyk na rasionalisering van hulle seleksieproses met die oog daarop ook om onnodige klem op universiteitstudie te probeer verminder en op hierdie wyse studente wat eintlik nie vir universiteitstudie geskik is nie, aan te moedig om betyds altematiewe tersi&#x00EA;re opleidingsmoontlikhede te soek. Maar om dit te doen, moet die universiteite die vrymoedigheid h&#x00EA; om werklik krities na hulle eie toelatingsvereistes te kyk. Die universi-teir se subsidieformule sal dan minder getalle-groei-gekoppel moet wees. Op die oomblik, soos agb. lede weet, is die subsidieformule gebaseer op die aantal studente wat &#x2019;n universiteit werf. As jou studentegetal in &#x2019;n bepaalde jaar nie groei nie, groei jou inkomste ook nie noemenswaardig nie. Daarom het ek die Tak: Universiteitsaangeleenthede van die departement en aan die Adviserende Raad op Universiteite gevra om by die komende hersiening van die struktuur van die subsidieformule aandag daaraan te skenk om die subsidieformule minder getallegroeigekoppel te maak sodat universiteite nie om hierdie rede daarvoor hoef te skrik om hulle eie seleksieprosesse te krities te be kyk nie. Ek dink nie daar kan van enige inrigting verwag word om sy studentetal tot sy eie nadeel te besnoei nie. Die suksesvolle hersiening van die toelatingsvereistes van universiteite, glo ek, kan ook daartoe bydra dat meer studente na ander, vir hulle meer gepaste, opleidingsmoontlikhede aan ander tersi&#x00EA;re inrigtings gekanaliseer word.</p>

<p>Hiermee wil ek volstaan en ek wil graag aan agb. lede wat ander vrae aan my gestel het, s&#x00EA; dat ek nota daarvan hou en wanneer ek weer praat, sal ek op daardie vrae antwoord.</p>

<speech by="#tarr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. A. TARR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to associate myself with the congratulations extended by other hon. members of this House to the new Minister in his post. The hon. the Minister has shown us the type of approach he intends to have and has already announced a number of welcome reforms. I will not go through all these, because my time is limited. We look forward to substantial improvements in the education system under the new Minister, although listening to his remarks on universities, I can see that there will be points of difference.</p>

<p>Three remarks were made today with which I should like to associate myself. The first remark was made by the hon. member for Standerton who said that he felt that use should be made of people in the various professions in the actual training and teaching of people. I think such a system can make a very important contribution to training and education.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia also emphasized the importance of teaching. However, I really do not think that he put enough emphasis on it. I believe there is no profession that is more important than our teaching profession. The teaching profession is the very foundation of our society. I believe it is even more important than the medical profession. We could perhaps get by without medical men and, with all due respect to the lawyers in this Committee, I think we would be better off without them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North spoke of the new investment which we are going to need in education. He referred to die formidable probleem which faces us. One probleem with investment in education is that <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_0142"/>it is not visible. One does not see immediate effects as is the case with investments in Sasol or industries like that. However, numerous studies throughout the world have shown that a country can make no better investment than an investment in the education of its people. Studies show returns in the order of 400&#x0025; and 500&#x0025; on investment in education. We must bear in mind, however, that it is a long-term type of investment.</p>

<p>I should now like to go on to a subject which the hon. the Minister did in fact address himself to in the final stages of his speech today. I refer to the probleem of first-year dropouts in universities. The statistics mentioned by his department in its annual report clearly show this. It is a probleem which many universities are giving serious attention to. They have different courses, bridging courses, etc., to try and assist the student during this transition stage in his life.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to another matter which the hon. the Minister also mentioned, namely that one particular group of students who in my experience are in a particularly disadvantageous position when they come to universities, is the Black group. The reasons for this are many. One reason is the language probleem. Another reason is that the standard of their matriculation education is not up to that of the White students. This is a fact and I do not think we need argue about it in this Committee at all. Another reason is that they lack that informal part of the curriculum that the White students have in their actual education. That is why I should like to emphasize today that I think it is vitally important that education comes under one umbrella. If that is not acceptable, at least education should be the same for everybody. I believe the potential for conflict in the education field is incredible. People must be treated the same. Another reason for the dropout probleem which the hon. the Minister did in fact anticipate is that universities are often not as selective as they might be when new students enrol. This is due to the financing formula which he spoke about. I am very pleased that he will give attention to this matter. Another reason, I believe, is that some universities have in the past not been running at full capacity. It has been to their advantage to perhaps accept the odd student, or in some cases more than the odd student, whom they should not in fact have accepted. The hon. the Minister indicated that he was also aware of this probleem and I am glad that he will be giving his attention to it.</p>

<p>One way of solving this dropout probleem&#x2014;here I should like to support my colleague, the hon. member for Pinelands and also the hon. member for Durban North&#x2014;is that at tertiary level educational institutions should be open to all. When I say that, I mean it should be at the discretion of the actual university. Let those in charge of a university decide how they are going to run their university. If they make any mistakes and create any problems for themselves, let them remedy their mistakes and solve their problems. If they choose at their university to provide a particular type of education, whatever it may be, it should within reason be permitted.</p>

<p>The local option.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tarr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. A. TARR</person>:</from>

<p>No, not the local option.</p>

<p>From the figures quoted to us it is obvious that we will have to expand our university facilities. However, I think that if we allow our universities to be open one favourable side-effect will be that there will be increased competition for positions in universities. We do not have the same dropout rate overseas that we have here because these universities have much more stringent entry requirements. They have a much bigger pool of prospective students who are looking for entry into the universities. Therefore, if Blacks were allowed access to all universities, it would probably not make much difference in the short run, but certainly over the longer run, I believe, it would.</p>

<p>There is another advantage that mixed universities will bring&#x2014;I think this is perhaps the most important one. Most of the leaders of our country in industry, in commerce and in politics come through the university system. I am pretty sure that most members of this Committee have at some stage been through the university system. It is precisely here that we should be getting to know other people, we should be getting to understand them, we should be getting rid of our prejudices and we should also be getting rid of <span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_0143"/>preconceived ideas which we may have about other people. We do have these prejudices, we do have these preconceived ideas. It is impossible not to have them because we never mix with these people, we never see them, we never talk to them. At tertiary level we have already formed our own ideas and while these may not be changed, it will at least give us an ideal opportunity to get to know our fellow South Africans.</p>

<p>The other point which we must remember and which the hon. member for Virginia also mentioned, is that we are all going into the same economy. We are working next to each other in the same offices, in the same shops and in the same factories. It is very important that when we go into that economy we should have an understanding of the man whom we are going to work shoulder to shoulder with. Surely, the time is past when we can have discrimination in our tertiary educational institutions. The hon. the Minister of Manpower has already recognized this in the workplace. He has done away with it to a large extent in the workplace, in trade unions and in training facilities. Why must we have these remnants still hanging over us in the tertiary educational system. I believe we should get rid of this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister also referred to the question of own ethnic universities for the various groups. I think he quoted radical leaders in Soweto opting for their own ethnic university and rejecting the extension of the Witwatersrand University, or any other university. I believe this is something we do not want. It is especially here in these ethnic universities where people are separated, where people get polarized. That is why they do not want the open universities. They want to be radicalized, they want to be polarized.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid wat nou net gaan sit het, was bekommerd oor die groot getalle druipelinge by ons universiteite. Ek dink ons bekommer ons almal oor sy kommer. Oor hierdie verskynsel is ons almal vol kommer. Om hierdie probleem die hoof te bied, bepleit hy blykbaar die daarstelling van oop universiteite. Nou wil ek vir die agb. lid vra, namens wie hy praat. Wil hy nou ons nie-Blanke studente uit hul milieu, uit hul omgewing, uit hul kultuurgroep bring en hulle dan in Blanke universiteite inforseer? Namens wie praat die agb. lid; wie se belange bevorder hy?</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek staan by hierdie geleentheid op omdat ek oor die begrip jeugweerbaarheid by ons skole wil praat. Om die belangrikheid hiervan te onderstreep, moet ons daarop let dat die jeug van ons tyd &#x2019;n geweldige uitdaging moet ontmoet. Ek dink nie &#x2019;n mens kan dit beter stel nie as deur te s&#x00EA; dat die volk van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika, net soos ander vrye volke in die w&#x00EA;reld, vandag met &#x2019;n titaniese oorlewingstryd te doen het. Omdat dit so is, is dit seker vanselfsprekend dat die drang na oorlewing ook in hul lewe &#x2019;n belangrike plek sal inneem. Omdat hierdie stryd nie net deur die volwassenes gestry sal word nie, is dit seker ook vanselfsprekend dat die jeug van ons tyd geleer sal word dat dit belangrik is om brandwag te staan oor die volkseiendom. Hierdie volkseiendomme sluit in die vryheid, die voorspoed, die geluk, die waardesisteme wat ons eer en waardeer en behou; kortom di&#x00E9; dinge wat ons onder beskawing bedoel. Omdat dit so is, is dit vir ons tragies dat di&#x00E9; taak so bemoeilik word deur die feit dat die aanslag op die jeug van ons tyd eintlik &#x2019;n subtiele, amper &#x2019;n onsigbare, aanslag is. Dit is gemik teen die siel en die liggaam van ons jeug.</p>

<p>Dit is vir my by hierdie geleentheid aangenaam <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_0144"/>om aan ons onderwys hulde te bring. Dit is onteenseglik waar dat die Staat deur die onderwys sy verantwoordelikheid erken het om jeugweerbaarheid aan te help. Daarom is ons dankbaar dat ons onderwys nie alleen die belangrikheid van hierdie instelling besef het nie, maar eintlik die hand aan die ploeg geslaan het. So vind ons dat ons Kaapse Onderwysdepartement, en ook ons ander onderwysdepartemente, reeds in 1972 jeugweerbaarheid by ons skole ingestel het. In 1980 is die inligtingstukke in verband met hierdie poging gesistematiseer, en kry ons dan vandag jeugweerbaarheid in ons laer skole sowel as ons ho&#x00EB;r skole. As ons die werklike begrip van jeugweerbaarheid moet omskrywe, dan is dit duidelik dat ons vir mekaar moet s&#x00EA; dat bo en behalwe die gewone onderwys, wat onteenseglik geweldig belangrik is, daar ook by ons skole spesiale programme ingestel word om jeugweerbaarheid te bevorder; spesiale programme om ons jeug paraat te maak vir die stryd wat voorl&#x00EA;. Want hoe belangrik die onderrig van reken, lees en skrywe en al die nuttige en goeie vakke op skool ook al mag wees, is dit mos ewe-eens belangrik dat ons jeug geleer moet word dat hierdie dinge wat werklik vir die volk saak maak, belangrik is; met ander woorde, dat sy persoonlikheid so ingestel moet word dat hy die begrippe van liefde vir dit wat sy eie is &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ek het dit nie gehoor nie. Begrippe soos liefde vir wat jou eie is, verdraagsaamheid, waarheid, Christelike waardes; dat hierdie begrippe vertroetel en opgebou moet word in belang van die jong dogter en die jong seun self, om hulle weerbaar te maak vir die stryd wat voorl&#x00EA;. As ons dit dan as agtergrond neem, dan dink ek ons kan jeugweerbaarheid omskrywe as &#x2019;n positie we bydrae om stelselmatig die jeug vir die eise van die lewe voor te berei. Met ander woorde om hulle in staat te stel om die aftakeling deur vreemde ideologie&#x00EB; die hoof te bied. Meer nog, om hulle in staat te stel om as waardige en gebalanseerde burgers en burgeresse hulle plek in die volksbestaan te kan volstaan. Daarom is dit so dat ons skole ingevolge hierdie poging jeugweerbaarheid ingestel het, eerstens by wyse van &#x2019;n program vir ons laerskole. Dit is vanself-sprekend dat di&#x00E9; program onderskeid sal tref tussen fisiese weerbaarheid en geestelike weerbaarheid. In die geval van fisiese weerbaarheid is dit seker duidelik dat ons hier te doen sal h&#x00EA; met sport, liggaamlike opvoeding, veiligheidsonderrig, brandbeheermaat-re&#x00EB;ls en so meer. By geestelike weerbaarheid kry ons dan weer te doen met die bywoning van volksfeeste, die leerlingrade, die jeugverenigings en eie geldbesteding.</p>

<p>Wanneer ons praat van geldbesteding, dan is dit in die tydvak waarin ons lewe geweldig belangrik dat ook ons kinders hieraan aan-dag moet gee. Een van die groot ekonome het nou die dag ges&#x00EA; dat in &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reld waar inflasie op sy ergste hoogty vier, daar dis-integrasie van die gemeenskap plaasvind. Maatskaplike onrus ontstaan. Staatsinstellings en strukture word afgetakel. As ons dus poog om korrekte geldbesteding by ons jeug in te skerp, dan kan ons, soos die ekonoom verder beweer het, waar individuele onoordeelkundige geldbesteding &#x2019;n belangrike faktor is by die daarstelling van inflasie in sy ergste graad, voorbrand maak om hierdie w&#x00EA;reld tendens, hierdie w&#x00EA;reldge-vaar, die hoof te bied. So het ons dan ook ons fisiese en geestelike weerbaarheidspro-gramme soos dit in ons laerskole ingestel is, en ook in ons ho&#x00EB;rskole, waar die ideaal van jeugweerbaarheid voortgesit word. Ek dink dit is goed dat ons by hierdie geleentheid s&#x00EA; dat ten spyte van die pogings wat ons onderwys aanwend om ons jeug weerbaar te maak, ons nie daarin sal slaag as die kerk en die ouerhuis nie hul taak in hierdie verband verrig nie. Dit is &#x2019;n voorvereiste vir die sukses en die vooruitgang van hierdie poging, dat ons kerk en ons ouerhuis hulle kant moet bring. By my bestaan geen twyfel nie dat ons kerk en ons ouerhuis as goeie vennote in hierdie grootse taak sal saamwerk met die staat om ons jeug weerbaar te maak. Dan sal ons die goeie vrugte van hierdie jeugweerbaarheid pluk en sal ons kan s&#x00EA; dat, soos die jare verbygaan en hierdie jong mense die volle lewe moet ingaan, hulle bereid sal wees en in staat sal wees om hulle plekke in hulle nuwe werkkring in te neem, om volwaardige en gebalanseerde mense by die kolleges en universiteite te wees en ook om &#x2019;n waardige plek in ons diensplig-en milit&#x00EA;re instellings, waarvoor hulle geroep mag word, in te neem.</p>

<p><span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0145"/>Ten slotte w&#x00ED;l ek van hierdie geleentheid gebruik maak om vir die agb. Minister te s&#x00EA; dat ons oneindig dankbaar is vir die wyse waarop hy die probleem van ons onderwysersalarisse besleg het. Soos die agb. lid vir Virginia ges&#x00EA; het, daar is nog knelpunte en ons is bewus daarvan; ons weet die agb. Minister sal daaraan aandag gee.</p>

<p>Een van die ernstige probleme staan in verband met ons universiteitsdosente. Ons voel dat hierdie knelpunt eerlank deur ons agb. Minister ook die hoof gebied sal word. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voor-sitter, ek wil aansluit by die agb. lid vir Newton Park, dat dit vir ons baie belangrik is dat ons kinders vandag nie alleen boekekennis sal h&#x00EA; nie, maar dat hulle baie beslis ook die fisiese en geestelike weerbaarheid sal h&#x00EA; wat hierdie tyd waarin ons lewe van elkeen van ons verg.</p>

<p>Ek wil net so &#x2019;n bietjie teruggaan in die verlede, om vir u te wys dat dit maar al die jare die owerheid en die mense van hierdie land se roeping was om die beste vir elke kind te wil. Teen, 1910 met Uniewording, het ons twee hoofstede gehad, naamlik Pretoria en Kaapstad. En sedert 1910 ry sessie-amptenare jaarliks van Pretoria na Kaapstad en van Kaapstad na Pretoria. Die duur van Parlementsittings het met verloop van tyd verleng en dit het meegebring dat daar groter onderwys-en gesins probleme ontstaan het. Partykeer moes die moeders met die kinders in Pretoria agterbly terwyl die vaders dan hier na Kaapstad toe kom, en partykeer moes hulle die landers saambring om hier in baie moeilike omstandighede onderwys te ontvang. Hulle was merendeels hier in skole gevestig waar daar partykeer nie genoegsame plek vir hulle was nie. By tye was daar ook nie vir genoeg boeke en banke voorsien-ing gemaak om reg aan hulle te laat geskied nie. Die Spoorwegadministrasie het in 1927 Sassar by Wingfieldlughawe as &#x2019;n tydelike verblyfplek begin. Selfs die huisvesting van hierdie mense was nie so gerieflik soos wat dit vandag vir ons is nie. Hulle het gesukkel om hier huisvesting te kry en as gevolg daarvan het die kinders daaronder gely. Selfs toe het die kinders nog na aparte skole gegaan en dit het baie ongemak en ongerief veroorsaak. In 1949 het die ouers &#x2019;n vergadering gehou om hierdie aangeleenthede te be spreek, en verto&#x00EB; is tot die betrokke departement, naamlik die Transvaalse Onderwys-departement, gerig. Dit is die departement wat, soos u netnou gehoor het, ook private skole subsidieer. Volgens wet was die Transvaalse Onderwysdepartement nie gemagtig om hier in die Kaap &#x2019;n skool vir sy kinders op te rig nie en daarom moes daar in 1950 &#x2019;n wet ingedien word. Die Konsolidasie-en Wysigingswet op Finansi&#x00EB;le Verhoudings, 1945, is in 1950 so verander dat daar &#x2019;n artikel ingevoeg is wat aan die uitvoerende komitee van &#x2019;n provinsie die reg gee om skole buite sy provinsie te stig en in stand te hou. Wet 31 van 1950 het s&#x00F3; begin&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit word bepaal deur Sy Majesteit die Koning, die Senaat en die Volksraad van die Unie van Suid-Afrika, &#x2026;</block>

<p>Dit was voor ons nog &#x2019;n Republiek geword het. Sassar&#x2014;Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwe&#x00EB; en &#x201C;South African Railways&#x201D;&#x2014;die Goewer-mentskool, het in Januarie 1951 begin nadat die ou milit&#x00EA;re slaghuis op Wingfield ingerig en in &#x2019;n skool omskep was. Die voertale sou Afrikaans en Engels wees, want daar was eweveel Engelssprekende en Afrikaans-sprekende kinders in daardie tyd. Mnr. J. D. Krige was die eerste hoof en mnr. G. A. C. Kuschke, die Sekretaris van Volkswelsyn, het die skool op 22 Januarie 1951 geopen. Die skool het onder die Stadskoolraad van Pretoria geressorteer. Daardie aand van 22 Januarie, om kwart oor agt die aand, is &#x2019;n vergadering van ouers in die sitkamer te Sassar gehou. 85&#x0025; van die ouers was teenwoordig. Dit het bewys hoe baie hulle werklik belanggestel het in die welvaart van hulle kinders. Daar is die stigting van komitees waargeneem. Op di&#x00E9; byeenkoms is melding gemaak van die hulp wat die Sassariete, soos hulle hulself genoem het, van genl. Smuts en dr. Malan gekry het. In 1960 verander die naam van Sassar, van die skool en van die dorp, na Akasiapark as gevolg van die baie Port Jacksonbome wat daar is, en wat onder die Akasiasoort val. &#x2019;n Grapmaker het op &#x2019;n stadium na die skool verwys as die groenteskool, want daar het toe skool gehou &#x2019;n mej. Kool, &#x2019;n mej. Pease en &#x2019;n mnr. Boonzaaier. In die joemaal staan, by die datum die 25ste van die 5de maand, dat die Eerste Minister, destyds natuurlik adv. Vorster, rugbytruie aan die skool beloof het, en die skool het dit <span class="col_269-270" refersTo="page_0146"/>toe ook gekry. In 1972 het die skool sy 21ste ver jaarsdag gevier en op daardie datum het die skool sy huidige wapen gekry. Die wapen het, soos u wat daar kinders het miskien sal weet, bo-aan die Uniegeboue, onder Tafelberg, en tussenin is &#x2019;n oop boek wat kennis voorstel, met twee swaeltjies wat die een &#x00F3;p en die een áf vlieg. Dit stel natuurlik hierdie trekkers voor wat van die suide na die noorde trek nes dit hulle pas. Ons is maar trekvo&#x00EB;ls. Trekarbeid, n&#x00E9;?</p>

<p>Nou sien u dat selfs in daardie dae daar baie mense was wat besorg was oor die wel en wee van kinders, wat baie ontwrig is deur die verskuiwing van hul ouers byna elke ses maande, van die een uiterste na die ander, van die suide na die noorde; van die noorde na die suide. Daar was altyd by ons owerheid die gevoel vir die kind wat die meeste van die tyd met so &#x2019;n verskuiwery die onderspit moes delf, wat die meeste van die tyd daaronder moes ly. Ek wil hulde bring aan al die hoofde en al die onderwyseresse en al die onderwysers wat in hierdie 30 jaar, want Akasiapark-laerskool is vanjaar 30 jaar oud, die beste van hul kragte gegee het vir die kinders van die mense wat hierheen gekom het en wat baie op offeringe moes maak. Nou is ek bly om te kan s&#x00EA; dat waar ons vanjaar die dertigjarige bestaan van Akasiapark vier, vier ons ook die twintigjarige bestaan van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika, en die vyftigste bestaansjaar van die Voortrekkers, waaroor iemand anders netnou sal praat.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag die agb. lid vir Germiston-Distrik gelukwens met die pragtige uiteensetting van die unieke en beroemde dorpie Akasiapark se skool en ek wil vir haar die versekering gee dat ek met elke woord wat sy ges&#x00EA; het, saamstem.</p>

<p>Dit het my nog altyd ge&#x00EF;nteresseer waarom die agb. lede aan die oorkant se argumente, stellings en uitgangspunte so radikaal van ons s&#x2019;n verskil, ook in hierdie debat, oor hierdie belangrike pos. Hierdie pos is inderdaad belangrik omdat dit oor ons kinders en oor ons jeug gaan. Die kinders van &#x2019;n volk is sy kosbaarste diamant, sy grootste talent. Ons moet hulle bewaar, hulle nie toedraai of wegsteek nie, maar laat ontwikkel en skitter, &#x2019;n Volk sonder kinders het geen toekoms nie, daarom kan &#x2019;n mens jou nie &#x2019;n volk, &#x2019;n land, &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reld sonder kinders voorstel nie. Om hierdie rede is die kind die belangrikste talent van die Staat, die volk, die ouer en die kerk. Die kind moet versorg en opgevoed word. Indien die kind verwaarloos word, het ons geen toekoms nie.</p>

<p>Oor die wyse van opvoeding heers daar groot verskille tussen ons en die Opposisie omdat ons uitgangspunte fundamenteel van mekaar verskil. Ons moet hierdie verskil beklemtoon. Ons wil &#x2019;n paar lyne trek, sodat daar geen misverstand is nie. &#x2019;n Mens kan nooit genoeg klem l&#x00EA; op die fundamentele uitgangspuntverskille nie. Ons en die Opposisie het verskillende uitgangspunte en daarom is daar &#x2019;n onoorbrugbare kloof tussen ons en hulle oor verskeie opvattinge en aktuele onderwerpe. Ek dink dit is noodsaaklik om in hierdie belangrike debat re-kenskap te gee van die basiese uitgangspunte, en ek wil dit graag illustreer aan die hand van drie voorbedde.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Greytown het op 13 Augustus 1981 in hierdie agb. Raad die volgende merkwaardige bekentenis gemaak. Ek lees in kolom 864&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ons moet mense oplei om &#x2019;n tegnologiese <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0147"/>eeu te betree. Die tegnologie is nie etnies-gebonde nie. Ek as ingenieur weet nie hoe om as &#x2019;n Afrikaner-ingenieur my werk te verrig nie. Ek het nie sodanige formules nie.</block>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het op 10 Maart 1978 in die agb. Raad die volgende opmerking gemaak. Ek lees kolom 2720&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As &#x2019;n mens die verband in aanmerking gaan neem waarin onderwys plaasvind, moet jy opnuut besef dat die w&#x00EA;reld nou &#x2019;n werelddorp is, soos dit genoem word. Dit was op kragtige wyse by ons tuisgebring toe die ruimtevaarders op die maan geland het en afgekyk het op die aarde soos ons dit ken, en dit vir hulle soos &#x2019;n klein gekleurde albaster gelyk het. Ons is almal saam in daardie dorp, of ons nou daarvan hou of nie.</block>

<p>Ek wil u ook &#x2019;n voorbeeld gee van die Russiese en Amerikaanse ruimtevaarders-ingenieurs. Met dieselfde wiskundige, swaar-tekrag-, fisiese en tegnologiese formules het di&#x00E9; twee ruimtereisigers volgens die werking van die natuurwette &#x2019;n grootse prestasie behaal. Toe die Russiese ruimtevaarder na die aarde terugkeer, het hy verklaar dat hy die hemelruim met sy ruimtetuig deurklief het, dat hy die hemel nie teengekom het nie en God ook nie. Volgens hom bestaan God nie. Hierteenoor het die Amerikaanse ruimtevaarder, toe hy met sy ruimtetuig in die hemelruimte gery het, die skeppingsverhaal uit Genesis voorgelees en ges&#x00EA; dat hy nou meer as ooit tevore glo dat daar &#x2019;n God is, omdat hy die wonderlike werking van die skepping sien, die natuurwette en die orde in die skepping. Op die oog af, dieselfde mense. Twee ruimte-ingenieurs van dieselfde w&#x00EA;relddorp, maar, op die keper beskou, &#x2019;n geweldige verskil. Die een &#x2019;n Rus, lid van die Russiese volk en gedril in die goddelose, kommunistiese religie, die ander een &#x2019;n Amerikaner, &#x2019;n lid van die Amerikaanse volk, waarop die Christelike religie, die Christelike lewens-en w&#x00EA;reldbeskoulike uitgangspunt beslag l&#x00EA;. Hierdie Amerikaanse ingenieur het &#x2019;n ander siening van die oorsprong en sin van die lewe en die w&#x00EA;reld volgens sy lewens-en w&#x00EA;reldbeskouing, as die Russiese ingenieur.</p>

<p>Dus alle mense, ook ingenieurs en volke, is nie gelyk nie. &#x2019;n Mens behoort tot &#x2019;n bepaalde volk en elke mens en volk word deur &#x2019;n bepaalde religie beheers al bly hulle in dieselfde w&#x00EA;reld en al is albei ingenieurs.</p>

<p>Terloops, ons Westerse beskawing is gedurende die afgelope 26 eeue in hoofsaak deur vier lewens-en w&#x00EA;reldbeskoulike uitgangspunte beheers; te wete die antiek-heidense, die Christelike, die Rooms-Katoliehe en die humanistiese, soos byvoorbeeld die liberalisme, die nasionaalsosialisme en die kommunisme. Prakties beteken dit dat wanneer &#x2019;n bepaalde religie op mense of gemeenskappe beslag l&#x00EA;, al sy lewensuitgange al sy lewensvorme en al sy kultuurgoedere deur di&#x00E9; bepaalde religie beheers word.</p>

<p>Nou wat is ons party se grondslag? In artikel 1 van ons party se beginsels staan geskry-we&#x2014;dit was ook in ons verkiesingsmanifes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Party erken die Opperheerskappy en leiding van God in die lotgevalle van lande en volke en soek die ontwikkeling van ons volkslewe langs ChristelikNasionale weg, met inagneming van die gewetens-en godsdiensvryheid van die individu.</block>

<p>Laat ons &#x2019;n paar praktiese voorbeelde gee van die uitwerking van die Christelike grondslag in ons politieke lewe.</p>

<p>Eerstens, ons grondwet se aanhef konstateer onder andere&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; die Almagtige God, &#x2026; Wat ons voorgeslagte uit baie lande byeengebring en hulle hier in hul eie gevestig het;</block>

<p>Die Kommunis se grondwet sal nie so &#x2019;n aanhef h&#x00E9;nie.</p>

<p>Tweedens, ons party en ons leiers glo dat die Argitek van nasies ons hier aan die suid-punt geplaas het met &#x2019;n doel, namens om die Christelike beskawing hier te vestig, te handhaaf en uit te bou, onder andere deur die opvoeding van ons kinders. Die Kommunis en die humanis sal di&#x00E9; roepingsbewustheid met minagting verwerp. Hulle kinders word as kommuniste opgevoed.</p>

<p>Teen hierdie agtergrond kan ons nou meer sinvol debatteer oor ons party se fundamentele uitgangspunte soos vervat in sy program van beginsels en die jongste manifes; die Christefik-Nasionale grondslag, die uitgangspunt <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0148"/>van volkere-verskeidenheid, en die gevolglike beginselstandpunt van eie skole en afsonderlike onderwysgeriewe.</p>

<p>Ons wil graag ons groot dank en ondersteuning teenoor ons agb. Minister uitspreek dat hy in die afgelope maande nie geskroom het, veral ten tyde van die verkiesing, om by herhaling die versekering te gee dat die uitgangspunte van Christelik-Nasionale en afsonderlike skole vir Blankes, soos ook in ons verkiesingsmanifes geformuleer is, nie aangetas sal word nie.</p>

<p>En nou kry ons weer agterdog teen die beslag van die De Lange-kommissie. Wat ook al die aanbevelings van hierdie weten-skaplike verslag mag wees, of enige ander verslag of kommissie of uitspraak of geleerde betoog deur &#x2019;n kokkedoor of wie ook al, is dit ondenkbaar om te dink dat ons party en ons Regering sal toelaat dat daar van die basiese uitgangspunte van ons party, nl. Christelik-Nasionale onderwys en afsonderlike skole vir Blankes, afgewyk sal word. Dit is vir my onbegryplik dat daar sulke gerugte is en ek vertrou dat die twyfel en agterdog sal verdwyn. Ek herhaal, hierdie sake is nie onderhandelbaar nie.</p>

<p>Dieselfde het gebeur met die voorstel oor buitelandse applikante, waarna die agb. Minister vanmiddag verwys het, om onder-wysbetrekkings in Suid-Afrikaanse skole. Toe moes ons agb. Minister, veral tydens die verkiesing, herhaaldelik die versekering gee dat sodanige applikante ook gekeur sal word vir karakter en gesindheid met die oog op die toepassing van onder meer die Christelike en die Nasionale beginsels soos neergel&#x00EA; in die Wet op die Nasionale Onderwysbeleid.</p>

<p>Om af te sluit, volgens ons grondslag moet ons onderwysers, ons dosen te, ons leerlinge, ons studente, ons skole en ons universiteite van die Christelike en Nasionale grondslag deurdrenk wees. Dit is ons taak. Ons wil dit egter baie duidelik stel: Die Afrikaner of die Nasionale Party het nie &#x2019;n alleenreg op die begrip Christelik-Nasionaal nie. Ons moet dit juis uitdra na ander volkere en partye. Dit is ons roeping.</p>

<p>Nee, ek kan nie nog &#x2019;n vraag beantwoord nie, my tyd is verskriklik min. Dit is vir my aangenaam om in &#x2019;n vergadering te praat waar die agb. Minister van Nasionale Opvoeding teen-woordig is. Ons het nou, soos ek reeds tevore buitekant hierdie Raad te kenne gegee het, &#x2019;n tydperk betree, en ons hoop dit duur langer as die nege of tien maande wat vorige Ministers by ons aanwesig was, &#x2019;n nuwe tydperk in die onderwys en in die kultuurw&#x00EA;reld en in die aanverwante sektore onder &#x2019;n Minister wat presies weet waaroor dit gaan. Dit is dan &#x2019;n welkome verskynsel in &#x2019;n departement wat deurgaande amptenare gehad het maar nie deurgaande Ministers nie. Die gevolge van gedurige verskuiwings en gedurige vervanging is natuurlik baie dui-delik sigbaar. Ek sou s&#x00EA; dat baie van die <span class="col_275-276" refersTo="page_0149"/>dinge waaroor my vriend, die agb. lid vir Pinelands, gepraat het, en natuurlik ook die ander agb. lede, toe hulle melding gemaak het van die dinge wat verkeerd was&#x2014;die knelpunte, die tekorte en die moontlike kri-sisse in die opvoedingstelsel&#x2014;in &#x2019;n groot mate te wyte is aan die vinnige verwisseling van politieke hoofde van die bepaalde departement. [Tussenwerpsels.] In dieselfde asem, as&#x2019;t ware, wil ek graag namens my party my bedanking aan dr. Van Wyk uit-spreek vir wat hy vir opvoeding in die ver-lede gedoen het. Ek wil hom ook &#x2019;n baie gese&#x00EB;nde rustydperk na 31 Januarie volgende jaar toewens, maar wat ek horn eintlik toewens is &#x2019;n rus sonder rus, want daar is &#x2019;n opskrif op Stellenbosch se hekplaatjie: &#x201E;Om te rus is om te roes.&#x201D; Ek wil ook dr. Meyer, wat hom gaan opvolg, by voorbaat alles van die beste toewens as Direkteur-generaal van hierdie ontsaglik belangrike departement.</p>

<p>Die agb. Minister het verlede jaar diens aanvaar as politieke hoof, en in Desember-maand het hy reeds &#x2019;n baie belangrike aankondiging gemaak in verband met &#x2019;n gebied waarin ek persoonlik besonder belang stel en wat ook aan my opgedra is om te hanteer. Ek verwys na die bevordering van Blanke kuituur in Suid-Afrika deur die Regering. Reeds in Desember het die agb. Minister te kenne gegee dat hy &#x2019;n kommissie gaan aanstel wat op grond van drie beginsels sy opdrag sal uitvoer. Die eerste was dat daar gekyk sal word na die skeppende beeldende kunste, na die skeppende woordkuns en die skeppende toonkuns. Vir die eerste keer het ons nou &#x2019;n kommissie wat tot by die kern van ons kultuurlewe kan dring. Daar word baie gepraat van kuituur, en volgens verskeie sprekers het dit verskillende inhoudende of fasette. Die faset van ons kultuurlewe wat egter oorlewing inhou&#x2014;d.w.s. oorlewing vir die geslagte wat nog moet kom&#x2014;is die skeppende kuns. Dit is die enigste faset wat hierdie oorlewingsfaktor inhou. Ons kan mil-joene aan sport en aan ons uitvoerende kunste bestee, maar hoe bloeiend hulle ook al kan wees, oor &#x2019;n jaar of twee, of oor vyf jaar of 50 jaar, is daar in die volksgedagte geen herinnering meer oor van wat gebeur het nie. Daar was miskien &#x2019;n wonderlike opvoering van een of ander opera in Kaapstad, of &#x2019;n wonderlike rugby-oorwinning in Nieu-Seeland, maar dit is dinge wat verdwyn. Die standhoudende, die oorlewende, die universele, is die skeppende kunste. Nou het die agb. Minister die eer om nie net &#x2019;n kommissie aan te gestel het om op hierdie aspek in te gaan nie, maar ook die eer dat hy dit saamgestel het uit mense in wie die lede van die algemene publiek, die mense met kennis, baie groot vertroue het. Ek is seker ons stem almal saam dat &#x2019;n kommissie onder die voor-sitterskap van &#x2019;n man soos dr. Jan Schutte, die gewese direkteur van die SAUK, &#x2019;n kommissie sal wees wat sy pligte vinnig, goed, deeglik en indringend sal nakom. Dit geld ook die lede wat in die kommissie sal dien. Ons hoop dat die verslag, wanneer dit uiteindelik gereed is, net so goed sal wees soos die De Lange-verslag wat, soos ons vanmiddag gehoor het&#x2014;en dit is wonderlike nuus&#x2014;openbaar gemaak gaan word sodra dit tegnies moontlik is. Ek verwelkom dit, wat ook al later die amptelike standpunt in die Witskrif oor die aanbeveling mag wees. Ons hoop dieselfde sal gebeur met die Schutte-kommissie se ondersoek na die skeppende kunste. Wanneer die verslag beskikbaar is, hoop ek dit sal ook deur die agb. Minister openbaar gemaak word sodat almal wat regstreeks of onregstreeks belang stel&#x2014;ons is klaarblyklik nie almal kunskenners nie&#x2014;kennis kan neem van wat ek voorsien as &#x2019;n nuwe tydperk in die skepping van bly-wende, oorspronklike kuns in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika. Dit is mos wat oor jare heen deur later geslagte uitgewys sal word as die rede waarom ons, ten spy te van al ons ander probleme, in byvoorbeeld 1980, 1981 of 1982, menswaardig en kuituurwaardig was.</p>

<p>Ek l&#x00EA; die nadruk op die beeldende kunste omdat daar in verband met hierdie bepaalde faset van ons kultuurlewe oor &#x2019;n tydperk van jare &#x2019;n drastiese tekortdoening was. Ons hoef net te dink aan wat beskikbaar gestel word, by wyse van Staatsgeld of belastingbe-talersgeld, vir die bevordering van die skeppende kunste, en hier praat ek nie van die behoud of bewaring van kuns nie, en ook nie van ander dinge soos kunsvlyt, ens., nie. In die huidige begroting is daar &#x2019;n bedrag van R115 000. Daarteenoor stel ek graag die bedrag in verband met die bevordering van die uitvoerende kunste. Weet agb. lede wat kry die streeksrade byvoorbeeld altesame?</p>

<p>In die tydsgewrig waarin ons le we, onder heersende lands-en w&#x00EA;reldomstandighede, is ek daarvan oortuig dat ons opnuut baie indringend moet kyk na die onderrig van geskiedenis in ons skole. Ek is gesterk in my oortuiging deur die uitsprake van gesaghebbendes oor die betekenis en waarde van geskiedenis en geskiedenisonderrig.

<block name="quote">Die geskiedenis leer ons wie ons is, hoe ons geword het, watter ideale van die verlede verwerklik is en wat nog vir die toekoms te doen staan.</block>

<p>Die digter W. E. G. Louw, het by geleent-heid ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Volk wat sy geskiedenis nie ken nie, is soos &#x2019;n mens wat aan geheueverlies ly.</block>

<p>Hoe kan daar uitvoering gegee word aan die wyse raad van &#x2019;n Paul Kruger, d.w.s. om te neem uit die verlede dit wat mooi en edel is en daarop die toekoms te bou, as ons die verlede nie ken nie?</p>

<p>In die lig van genoemde uitsprake is dit met &#x2019;n gevoel van beklemming om die hart dat ons kyk na die huidige posisie van ge-skiedenisonderrig in ons skole. In alle skole is die onderrig van geskiedenis tot aan die einde van st. 7 verpligtend. Die tyd laat my nie toe om in diepte &#x2019;n kritiese ontleding van die inhoud van hierdie leerplanne te maak nie. Vir st. 8, 9 en 10 is geskiedenis in ons skole &#x2019;n keusevak. Wat bring hierdie feit mee? Ek gee agb. lede die syfers&#x2014;as persen-tasies&#x2014;wat aandui hoeveel leerlinge geskiedenis in st. 10 as vak neem in die onderskeie provinsies. In Natal in 1970 het 44&#x0025; van die kandidate vir die senior sertifikaat of st. 10-leerlinge geskiedenis as vak geneem. In 1980 was die syfer slegs 30&#x0025;. In die Kaapprovin-sie was die syfer vir 1970 51&#x0025;, terwyl dit in 1980 slegs 34&#x0025; was. Vir die Transvaal was die syfer vir 1970 45&#x0025;, terwyl dit in 1980 slegs 31&#x0025; was. Vir die OVS was die syfer in 1970 37&#x0025;, maar in 1980 slegs 35&#x0025;. Met ander woorde, &#x2019;n gemiddeld van minder as een-derde van ons leerlinge neem geskiedenis tot en met st. 10. In die Hg van wat W. E. G. Louw ges&#x00EA; het, is dit onrusbarend dat wanneer twee-derdes van ons st. 10-leerlinge <span class="col_279-280" refersTo="page_0151"/>die skoolbanke verlaat, hulle soos mense is wat aan geheueverlies ly. Daar is egter iets wat nog meer onrusbarend is, as bogenoemde feit saamgelees word met wat prof. Garson, professor in geskiedenis aan die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand, reeds in 1968 ges&#x00EA; het, en ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Judging from some pronouncements, we are living in an anti-historical age. Edmund Leach, the social anthropologist, while not actually calling for the abolition of history teaching, suggests that its purpose should be to encourage the young to hold the past in complete contempt. Today&#x2019;s task for history is, on this view, to teach its own irrelevance to the future.</block>

<p>Dit klink mos na die taal van mense wat die waarde van die onderrig van geskiedenis sover moontlik in diskrediet probeer bring, omdat dit dan rassehaat sou bevorder. Terselfdertyd kan die hou van &#x2019;n Sharpevilledag en die Steve Biko-kultus nie sterk genoeg gepropageer word nie. Ek kan lank uitwei oor die waarde van geskiedenis en die kennis van daardie vak vir die individu, maar ek wil volstaan met &#x2019;n enkele opmerking. Die kennis van geskiedenis verleen pers-pektief aan die belangrikheid van gebeure of optrede. Bowenal bring dit &#x2019;n balans in ons oordele.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag &#x2019;n paar voorbeelde noem. Die dra van passe word as &#x2019;n negatiewe stap beskou, en die skuld daarvoor word uiten-uit op die skouers van die NP gel&#x00EA;. Weet agb. lede egter wie die man was wat die dra van passe in Suid-Afrika ingestel het? Dit was graaf Caledon, die Engelse goewerneur, wat in 1809 die paswette vir die Kleurlinge ingestel het. Kan agb. lede insien hoe dit &#x2019;n toestand van balans teweegbring? Daar is egter ook die gedagte aan territoriale segregasie of gebiedskeiding. Dit is egter nie die gedagtekind of &#x2019;n daad van die NP nie. Weet agb. lede wie die eerste persoon was wat hierdie gedagte in die Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis ingedra het? Dit was John Cradock, &#x2019;n Engelse goewerneur, en Theophilus Shepstone, die goewerneur in Natal.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is met groot dankbaarheid en met &#x2019;n gevoel van pi&#x00EB;teit dat ek vanjaar aan die besprekings van hierdie Pos kan deelneem, en dit met die wete dat daar groter rustigheid in die geledere van die onderwyserskorps ingetree het. &#x2019;n Herhaling van wat die afgelope paar jaar in die onderwys gebeur het, veral met die onderwyser, kan Suid-Afrika nie weer bekostig nie. Alle betrokkenes, insluitende die Regering, het uit die ongelukkige gebeurtenisse van die afgelope jare geleer, en &#x2019;n herhaling daarvan sal sekerlik nie hoef plaas te vind nie. Daarom is dit sekerlik van pas om in hierdie stadium, met die bespreking van hierdie Pos, dank te betuig en hulde te bring aan diegene wat betrokke was by die oplossing van hierdie knelpunte. Eerstens noem ek graag die agb. Minister wat as opvoedkundige dadelik die knelpunte en probleme ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer het en raakgevat het. Ek noem ook graag sy voorganger, die vorige Minister van Nasionale Opvoeding, die departement, die Kommissie vir Administrasie, die Eerste Minister en sommer die hele Kabinet. Almal het in &#x2019;n meerdere of mindere mate bygedra tot die oplossing van hierdie probleem. Daar is egter een instansie wat ek nog nie genoem het nie en waarna ek vandag wil verwys. Ek verwys na die Federale Raad van Onderwysersverenigings in Suid-Afrika. Hierdie raad <span class="col_281-282" refersTo="page_0152"/>het &#x2019;n lang geskiedenis wat ek graag net eers kortliks wil skets.</p>

<p>So vroeg al soos 1907 is daar deur die lede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie &#x2019;n beskrywingspunt ingedien wat as volg gelui het, en ek haal aan uit die proefskrif van dr. G. J. van Lull, getiteld &#x201E;Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie&#x2014;1905&#x201D; van 1970&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Het kongres spreke zich uit over het oprigting van een Onderwysersraad bestaande uit verteenwoordigers van de verschillende Onderwysersverenigingen in Zuid-Afrika.</block>

<p>In 1909 is daar &#x2019;n daadwerklike poging aangewend om samewerking te bewerkstellig toe vyf onderwysersverenigings in Bloemfontein vergader om ooreenkoms tot samewerking te probeer bereik. Hulle was die South African Teachers&#x2019; Association, die Suid-Afrikaanse Onderwysersunie, die Vereniging van de Onderwijzers en Onderwijzeressen in Zuid-Afrika, die Transvaal Teachers&#x2019; Association en die Oranje River Colony Teachers&#x2019; Association. Dit was die vyf wat by hierdie vergadering betrokke was. Dit was eers op 22 Desember 1922 dat &#x2019;n konferensie verteenwoordigend van al die onderwysersverenigings in Kaapstad bel&#x00EA; is, waar die Federale Raad van Onderwysersverenigings in Suid-Afrika in die lewe geroep is. Uit die aangehaalde geskrif is dit baie duidelik dat die Federale Raad aanvanklik groeipyne ondervind het, veral in verband met die taalkwessie, en dat die agt Afrikaanse onderwysersverenigings sterk standpunt ten gunste van moedertaalonderwys in-geneem het.</p>

<p>Die ontbinding van die Federale Raad het verskeie kere sterk ter sprake gekom. Dit is veral van belang om daarop te let dat dit veral die TO, die Transvaalse Onderwysers-vereniging was wat skerp gereageer het op die onvermo&#x00EB; van die Federale Raad om die aangeleentheid aan die owerhede voor te l&#x00EA;. Die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging het derhalwe &#x2019;n voorstel aan die kongres van die Federale Raad voorgel&#x00EA; wat gelui het dat die Federale Raad in die eerste plek nie aan sy oorspronklike doel beantwoord nie en, tweedens, dat die Federale Raad besluit om sy ontbinding by sy geaffilieerde verenigings aan te beveel.</p>

<p>In 1950 herbeklemtoon die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging die feit dat die Federale Raad nie sy bestaan regverdig nie. Die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging wys daarop dat die Federale Raad in die voorafgaande tien jaar slegs twee afvaardigings na die Minister gelei het&#x2014;daardie tyd het die agb. Minister nog ruskans gekry&#x2014;en nie juis veel sukses gehad het nie. &#x2019;n Verdere twis-punt was ook die verhouding van verteenwoordiging teenoor getalle wat verteenwoorv dig word.</p>

<p>In 1954 is &#x2019;n gewysigde konsepgrondwet opgestel waarvolgens verteenwoordiging in verhouding gebring is met die ledetal van die verenigings. In die vervolg sou die Federale Raad hom ook bepaal by sake van &#x2019;n nie-ideologiese, opvoedkundige en professionele aard.</p>

<p>In Oktober 1955 is die nuwe Federale Raad, soos hy tans funksioneer, behoorlik gekonstitueer en op die been gebring met die doelstelling om die beste belange van die opvoeding, die onderwys en die onderwyser te dien deur gesamentlike optrede van die lede van die Federasie.</p>

<p>Dit was juis in uitvoering van bogenoemde doelstellings dat die Federale Raad die afge-lope aantal jare opgetree het en dat sy han-delinge en optrede ooreenkomstig hierdie doelstellings beoordeel moet word. Die Federale Raad het sekerlik &#x2019;n groot rol gespeel in die bedinging vir beter voordele vir sy lede en het ongetwyfeld &#x2019;n deurslagge-wende rol in die verbetering van salarisse gespeel. Daarvoor, glo ek, s&#x00EA; die onderwy-sers dwarsoor die land baie dankie. Die bedinging was by tye kwaai en hard, maar het deurentyd in &#x2019;n gees van welwillendheid plaasgevind.</p>

<p>Verskeie voorsitters was by hierdie proses betrokke, en elkeen het op sy kenmerkende wyse sy deel bygedra. Ek wil egter die Sekretaris van die Federale Raad, mnr. J. F. Steyn, uitsonder. Hy is ook sekretaris van die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging. In die hele proses was hy seker di&#x00E9; persoon wat die meeste en die langste by hierdie onder-handelinge betrokke was. Hy was gedurig by die brandpunt, in die voorste linie. Heel dik-wels was hy selfs &#x2019;n omstrede figuur. Die geskiedenis sal nog in die toekoms aandui watter rol mnr. Steyn in die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging en in die Federale Raad gespeel het, insluitende die onlangse bedingingsproses. Ek is seker ek praat <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0153"/>namens al die lede van die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging, waarvan ek ook nog steeds &#x2019;n lid is, en ook namens al die onder-wysers, as ek mnr. Steyn bedank vir die onvermoeide ywer wat hy aan die dag gel&#x00EA; het om die onderwyssaak te dien.</p>

<p>Die Federale Raad moet egter nie net gesien word as &#x2019;n bedingingsmeganisme vir beter salarisse en diensvoorwaardes vir die onderwyser nie. Dit is maar &#x2019;n klein deel van die totale bedrywighede wat volgens sy grondwet aan hom toevertrou word. Dit gaan in die eerste plek oor die bevordering van die opvoeding en die onderwys in en deur die skool. Dit is die eerste taak van die Federale Raad. Vir hierdie doel is dit dan ook nodig dat daar goed opgeleide, maar veral ook gemotiveerde, onderwysers in die klaskamer beskikbaar moet wees. Bo en behalwe die feit dat die onderwysersvereni-gings as personeelverenigings funksioneer, tree hulle dan ook op as opvoedkundige verenigings en kultuurverenigings. &#x2019;n Verdere funksie van hierdie verenigings is ook om die self-ontwikkeling van die onderwysers te bevorder. Daar word dus verskeie kursusse en saamtrekke gere&#x00EB;l, met die uitsluitlike doel om die onderwyser tot groter hoogtes te inspireer en te aktiveer. So het die Transvaalse Onderwysersvereniging ver-lede jaar bykans 6 000 onderwysers by sodanige saamtrekke betrek.</p>

<p>Verder speel die georganiseerde onder-wysberoep &#x2019;n sterk rol in die verteenwoordiging in amptelike liggame, op departementele en interdepartementele vlak. Ook het die erkende onderwysersverenigings gedien in talie departementele komitees wat as werkkomitees optree of wat in &#x2019;n adviserende hoedanigheid optree. So byvoorbeeld is daar sitting verkry in die sillabuskomitees van die verskillende onderwysdepartemente en word byna geen departementele komitee deesdae saamgestel sonder dat die georganiseerde beroep ook daarby betrek word nie.</p>

<p>Dit het meegebring dat daar &#x2019;n besondere vertrouensband tussen die georganiseerde beroep en die departement en sy Minister geskep is. Gebrek aan tyd laat my nie toe om meer aspekte op te noem nie, maar dit is baie duidelik, vir almal wat die georganiseerde onderwysberoep bestudeer, dat daar hier &#x2019;n baie belangrike skakel in die onder-wysketting is wat &#x2019;n onontbeerlike rol in die opvoeding en die onderwys speel.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die loop van my toespraak sal ek kom by die agb. lid vir Gesina. Ek wil graag die aan-dag vestig op &#x2019;n item in die jaarverslag onder die hoof &#x201E;Kommissie vir Jeugaangeleent-hede&#x201D; van die Nasionale Kultuurraad waar daar melding gemaak word dat daar onder meer vir die Voortrekkerbeweging &#x2019;n bedrag van R2 500 opsygesit is. Ek wil dus heel aan die begin aan die agb. Minister vra of &#x2019;n mens vir so &#x2019;n beweging, wat so &#x2019;n belangrike rol in die nasionale verdedigingstrate-gie van ons jeug speel, nie &#x2019;n groter deel moet laat toekom nie. Hierdie jeugbeweging van die Afrikanervolk, wat op 30 September vanjaar presies 50 jaar oud sal wees, verdien myns insiens hierdie Raad se aandag omdat ons erkenning moet gee aan die dure opvoeding en kultuurbevorderingstaak wat hierdie jeugbeweging verrig het, en vandag nog verrig, tot voordeel van &#x2019;n baie belangrike deel van ons bevolking in hierdie land.</p>

<p>Ons moet die totstandkoming van hierdie beweging beoordeel teen die agtergrond van die omstandighede waarin ons volk verkeer het in 1931 en die daaropvolgende jare. Dit was die depressietyd en daar was armoede. Daar was ellende met gepaardgaande ver-guising vir hierdie mense, en daar was ook die bedreiging wat dit inderdaad ingehou het vir die selfbewussynsproses van hierdie jong volk van ons land. Dit was &#x2019;n volk wat slegs drie dekades se vordering gemaak het vanaf daardie oomblik in 1901 toe hierdie volk sy vryheid ontneem is en uitwissing en ondergang hom inderdaad in die gesig gestaar het.</p>

<p>Hierdie gebeurtenis, en die daaropvolgende jare van storm en drang rondom die rebellie van 1914, het wonde en littekens agtergelaat wat nog baie duidelik sigbaar was in daardie tyd, drie dekades later. Dit was toe dat manne soos dr. C. F. Visser, eerste hoofleier van die Voortrekkerbeweging, besef het dat die opheffingstaak by ons jeug, by ons kinders, die volk van more en die leiers van more, moet begin. Daarna het iemand soos oom Japie Heese gekom en na hom ook oom Badie Badenhorst, wat onlangs oorlede is en in wie se plek prof. Carel Boshoff, die huidige hoofleier van die Voortrekkerbeweging, gekies is. Rondom hierdie leiers was egter &#x2019;n menigte manne en <span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0154"/>vroue geskaar wat hierdie volksbeweging gelei en gedra het en aan wie ons vanmiddag by hierdie geleentheid graag hulde wil bring. Een so &#x2019;n leier was juis ons huidige Minister van Nasionale Opvoeding, wat in die laat veertigerjare by my persoonlik as verkenner van die Christiaan De Wet-kommando bekend gestaan het as veldkomet Gerrit Viljoen. Dit is &#x2019;n feit dat hy ons destyds goed opgekeil het, maar in hom het ons &#x2019;n leier gehad wat dissipline, ordelikheid, vaderlandsliefde, patriotisme en volksheide by ons ingedril en ingemoker het. Dit is aan sulke leiers wat rigting aan ons lewens gegee het, wat gebou en gevorm het aan &#x2019;n eie lewens-beskouing, soos die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Oos dit so mooi gestel het, wat by ons die standpunt van behoudendheid tuisgebring het, aan wie ek vandag graag hulde wil bring. Hulle vorm vir my die suiwerste klatergoud van ons volk, die glans en die sprankel wat elke volk in &#x2019;n mindere of meerdere mate het. Die mate van glans en die mate van sprankel van enige volk hang van die gehalte van sulke leiers af. Baie agb. lede van hierdie Raad was lede van hierdie beweging. Die agb. lid vir Ermelo hier langs my was Hd van dieselfde Christiaan De Wetkommando. Inderdaad, diegene wat lid was van daardie beweging kan nooit &#x2019;n einde maak aan die ideale van daardie beweging nie. Dit is dan ook waarom hulle vandag hier is. Dit is juis die Christelik-Nasionale en maatskaplike deugde wat deur medevolksen landsgenote erken word, wat hulle na vore gestoot en in hierdie verantwoordelike leiersposisies geplaas het. Dit is wat hulle gebring het by wat hulle vandag is. Hulle word vertrou met die ideale en strewes van &#x2019;n volk wat &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie plaas op sy eie vryheid en eie selfbeskikkingsreg.</p>

<p>Gelukkig gaan hierdie taak van die Voortrekkerbeweging vandag nog onverpoos voort. Die belangstelling van volwassene en kind word tans steeds gemobiliseer tot diensbaarheid aan land en volk en taal, soos beliggaam in die Voortrekkerbelofte waaruit ek enkele aanhalings wil maak: Om getrou my plig teenoor my God, my volk en my land te doen; om ten alle tye my medemens te dien; en om die Voortrekkerwet na te leef. Hierdie Voortrekkerwet word o.m. soos volg omskryf: &#x2019;n Voortrekker se woord is sy eer; &#x2019;n Voortrekker is gehoorsaam en eerbiedig sy meerdere; &#x2019;n Voortrekker is sober en spaarsaam; &#x2019;n Voortrekker hou sy taal in ere. Hierdie taal is sy moedertaal, Afrikaans. Dit is &#x2019;n taal wat gebore is en gegroei het, gelouter en geskaaf is hier in ons eie vaderland, Suid-Afrika, en sigbaar herkenbaar is sedert 1875. Dit is die taal waarmee ons leiers saamgevoeg het wat uit innerlike oortuiging saam behoort. Dit is die taal waarin ons digters en skrywers ons grootste roem en ons grootste vreugde en ons grootste smart en sielswroeging uitgebeeld het. Dit is die taal waarin ons ons Godsdiens beoefen. Dit is die taal waarin ons die skitterwoorde van die psalmdigter en die Skrifberymer aanhoor. Dit is die taal waarin ons ons eerste klanke aan moeders-knie aangeleer het, waarin ons ons eerste lewensbehoeftes geuiter het. Dit is die taal waarin ons ook eendag ons afskeidsboods-kap sal oordra aan diegene wat na ons kom.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is die sielser-varinge wat jy as Voortrekker kon meemaak; dit is die ervaring wat ons kinders vandag nog ervaar onder die leiding van manne soos bv. die agb. lid vir Gezina, of soos hy bekend staan by die Voortrekker-kommando van Akasiapark, kommandant Karel Swanepoel. &#x2019;n Mens kan nooit jou belewenisse vergeet nie. Die ervaring van &#x2019;n Voortrekkerkamp in die vrye en verruklike natuurskoon van ons vaderland is een van die dinge wat &#x2019;n mens nooit kan vergeet nie. &#x2019;n Mens kan daar, as jy in die nag moet wag-staan, alleen onder die Suiderhemel peins en besin oor hierdie land en sy mense, of jy kan na die naggeluide luister en jou verwonder aan die sterrehemel bo jou. Dit is daar waar jy onherroeplik met pi&#x00EB;teit en deernis ge-knoop word aan die bodem van hierdie vaderland, en dit is daar waar jy die kameraad-skap en liefde vir volksgenoot sien groei en ontwaak. Dit is wat daar in die veld en om die kampvuur gebeur. Hierdie ervaring tel onder die heel mooiste, die heel beste, die heel vrugbaarste, die heel rykste en die mees blywende wat enige mens in sy lewe kan ondervind. Dit gun ek vir elke jongeling in hierdie land. Mag dit die Voortrekkerbeweging beskore wees om steeds van krag tot krag te gaan en die kultuurerfenis van hierdie volk te bewaar en uit te bou. Mag die Voortrekkerbeweging steeds voldoen aan die pragtige beskrywing van een van ons digters, nl.&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. M. ANDREW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. speakers who have preceeded me will forgive me if I do not react to their speeches, given the short time available under this Vote.</p>

<p>I am sure the importance of education to South Africa and to the children of this country will be common cause amongst all of us here. I think the Venter Report puts it well when it says that &#x201C;education may rightly be described as the corner-stone on which the future rests. It is the key to the future prosperity of the country and all its people, to employment, to industrial development and to the stability of the State&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I am sure it is also common cause among hon. members here today that we have a shortage of skilled manpower in South Africa and that the situation will continue into the future. Because of that shortage there is an important need for the optimum utilization of whatever skilled manpower we have. Today I would like to talk about the role of the school principal in our educational system, because I believe that the school principal has a critically important role in this system.</p>

<p>There was an investigation by school inspectors in the United Kingdom some years ago. In their report they said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The key to a good secondary school, whether or not it is selective or comprehensive, maintained or fee-paying, is a head who can encourage teamwork, discipline without tension, self-confidence and high standards. Without exception the most important single factor in the success of these schools is the quality of leadership of the head. Without exception the heads have qualities of imagination and vision, tempered with realism which have enabled them to sum up not only their present situation but also attainable future goals.</block>

<p>I can only heartily endorse and welcome the decision arising out of the Venter Report to upgrade school principals and to increase their remuneration considerably. I think it is welcome and overdue.</p>

<p>It is interesting to look at the scope of the school principal and the range of his responsibilities. Clearly, as a leader and educationalist, he plays a vital role in the healthy development of our children. But even in statistical terms the scope of his job is impressive.</p>

<p>Let us look at the principal of a large secondary school. He presides over an investment of some R5 million, if you take into account the value of the buildings and the site as well as the investment in the education of the staff. He manages an organization employing some 40 university graduates to teach up to a thousand scholars and he is responsible for ensuring that society gets good value for the R1 million it spends on the school each year. If one bears in mind the wide scope of the school principal&#x2019;s responsibilities, the need to use his scarce skills to the best advantage and the importance of recognizing his professional status, it is startling how little administrative and secretarial assistance he is given.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position as it is at present as far as clerical assistant for a school principal is concerned. In provincial schools with fewer than 250 pupils they have one part-time clerical assistant. For 250 to 600 pupils they have one full-time clerical assistant. For 600 to 900 pupils they have one part-time and one full-time clerical assistant. It is interesting to contrast the position of a provincial school with a vocational school which previously fell under the Department of National Education. A provincial school of 550 pupils is provided with one full-time clerical assistant, a vocational school with four full-time clerical assistants. Surely it is obvious that school principals and teachers cannot operate productively as educators with so little administrative assistance, particularly when one considers all the red tape and the enormous number of forms that they continually have to cope with.</p>

<p>It is not surprising therefore that the Venter <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0156"/>Report found a low level of satisfaction among teachers with what is described as the &#x2018;organizational climate&#x2019; of their working life. It is also not surprizing that most of the bigger schools employ extra secretarial assistants if the parents can afford to pay for them. It is surely most unsatisfactory that the efficient functioning of a school should depend on the ability of the parents to employ extra staff.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position of the clerical assistant who is colloquially known as the school secretary. In the words of a school secretary she is, and I quote, &#x201C;expected to run an efficient office, maintain a pleasant manner with the public, staff and pupils, keep an accurate record of the school&#x2019;s finances, including a knowledge of PAYE and UIF and certain Government moneys, handle his or her own correspondence, in certain circumstances, man a busy switchboard and have the integrity to type examination papers and act as confidential secretary to the principal.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Yet these people are classified as Grade 1 clerical assistants and are on the lowest rung of the ladder with no prospect of attaining higher grading. They are paid a pittance, less than a junior copy typist in most organizations. They start at R208,50 per month and after nine years reach R372,50 per month. In contrast a typist with a higher grading in the Civil Service starts at R280,50 per month and after eight years earns R432,50 per month. She is, therefore, R60 per month better off than the school secretary. This unhappy situation has long been a considerable source of dissatisfaction in our schools and I call on the hon. Minister to take urgent action to improve the position in our schools.</p>

<p>Firstly, the hon. Minister should increase the number of administrative and secretarial posts at the schools. Secondly, he should create an administrative post at our larger schools similar to that of a bursar or registrar at a training college or university not only to take work off the principal, but to supervise some of the administrative activities. Thirdly, he should establish a category which recognizes the role played by the school secretary and recognizes the fact that she is far more important and has far greater responsibility than a grade 1 clerical assistant. Fourthly, he should increase the salary of school secretaries.</p>

<p>These steps are essential if our school principals and teachers are to utilize to the full the special skills for which they are employed and paid. Furthermore, the job satisfaction of thousands of teachers would increase dramatically if they were released of most of the tedious, time-consuming and demoralizing form-filling that they are required to do. I urge the hon. the Minister to give these matters his serious consideration.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. D. K. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, van my kant af wil ek die debat vanaand voortsit deur te verwys na bladsy 175 van die departement se jaarverslag waar die aantal persone wat aan universiteite as personeellede verbonde is, in tabelvorm weergegee word. Mens is geneig om gewoonlik met betrekking tot &#x2019;n universiteit net aan die doserende personeel te dink. Ek wil egter vanaand hier die aandag daarop vestig dat bo en behalwe die doserende personeel daar ook die nie-doserende personeel is, d.w.s. die mense wat in die administra-tiewe afdeling werksaam is, wat as tegniese assistente werksaam is, die klerklike personeel, die instandhoudingspersoneel, die koshuispersoneel en ander personeel. Wanneer ek nou aan my eie universiteitsloopbaan terug dink en die jare wat ek as student deurgebring het, wil ek &#x2019;n woord van dank bring aan hierdie mense wat min of meer agter die skerms by die universiteit werksaam is. Ek dink dat elkeen van ons wat aan &#x2019;n universiteit studeer het of daarby betrokke was, op die een of ander wyse te doen gekry het met die administratiewe of tegniese personeel of selfs met die huismoeders of &#x2018;nonnies&#x2019;, soos ons hulle daar in my w&#x00EA;reld genoem het. &#x2019;n Mens dink soms daaraan dat jou universiteitsdae nie volmaak sou gewees het sonder daardie persone nie.</p>

<p>In die jongste jaarverslag van die departement word ons aandag ook op die doserende personeel gevestig, van wie daar in 1980 6 212 manlike dosente en 1 830 vroulike dosente was. In &#x2019;n debat soos hierdie dink ek is dit altyd van belang dat &#x2019;n mens sal weet dat jou doserende personeel besig is&#x2014;d.w.s. as hulle hul werk behoorlik doen en ek dink die meeste van hulle doen uitstekende werk&#x2014;om aandag te gee, ondersoek te doen en &#x2019;n opvoedingstaak te verrig. Ek dink dat <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0157"/>baie ouers wat hulle hele lewe lank gewerk het om hulle kinders na &#x2019;n universiteit te kan stuur, soms met &#x2019;n tikkie kommer hulself afvra wie die mense aan die universiteit is wat hulle kind moet oplei in die besondere vakdissipline waarvoor die kind ingeskryf het. Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het daarop gewys dat daar &#x2019;n ruk gelede &#x2019;n berig verskyn het oor die feit dat daar so baie nie-Suid-Afrikaanse burgers aan sommige van ons universiteite verbonde is. Waar hierdie besondere stelling nou die w&#x00EA;reld ingestuur is, dink ek dit is tog belangrik dat ons onsself weer moet afvra hoeveel persone wat aan ons universiteite doseer nie Suid-Afrikaanse burgers is nie. Die Suid-Afrikaanse universiteite het dikwels in hul begin jare wanneer &#x2019;n nuwe vakdissipline ingestel is, van dosente gebruik gemaak wat nie Suid-Afrikaanse burgers is nie. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet waardering h&#x00EA; vir mense wat hul eie vaderland verlaat het om Suid-Afrika in hierdie opsig behulpsaam te wees. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens kri-ties na hierdie persentasie van ons doserende personeel verwys, doen &#x2019;n mens dit nie in &#x2019;n gees van ondankbaarheid nie, maar in &#x2019;n gees van dankbaarheid vir die mense wat sulke goeie werk gedoen het. Nou is dit egter so dat die universiteitkampus, daardie klein w&#x00EA;reldjie binne &#x2019;n groot w&#x00EA;reld, vir enige volk van baie groot belang is. Wat op &#x2019;n universiteitsterrein aangaan, nie net wat die akademiese gebied aanbetref nie, maar ook op die vlak van studentepolitiek, raak tog ook die w&#x00EA;reld daarbuite. Dit is nie net die ou clich&#x00E9; dat die jong manne en vroue wat vandag aan &#x2019;n universiteit studeer m&#x00F4;re se leiers is wat van toepassing is nie, maar die belastingbetaler en die ouers wat hul kinders na die universiteit stuur, verwag dat daardie instelling die land sal dien.</p>

<p>Ons ken die studentepolitiek in Suid-Afrika en dwars oor die w&#x00EA;reld. Die kommuniste is nog bedrywig met die arbeiders, maar hulle het hul belangstelling in die jongste tyd ook begin toespits op die studerende jeug aan ons universiteite en selfs op ho&#x00EB;r-skoolvlak. Hierdie verskynsel het my oor die jare bekommer, maar veral in die afgelope tyd. Wat gaan werklik by ons universiteitskampusse aan? Self het ek baie jare lank aktief deelgeneem aan die studentepolitiek. As &#x2019;n lid van die Suid-Afrikaanse Studente-bond het ek my opponente, Nusos, baie vroeg in my lewe leer ken. Ek wil vir die agb. lid vir Pinelands s&#x00EA; dat enige verant-woordelike politieke party, soos ek glo al die partye hier is, aandag moet skenk aan studentepolitiek. Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het verwys na die sogenaamde dreigement dat die agb. Minister die subsidies van sekere universiteite gaan wegneem en het &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer vir die &#x201E;foreign academics&#x201D;. Ek wil vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat dit tyd geword het dat sy party net so krities moet kyk na wat in die studentepolitiek aan die gang is en na die doen en late van sekere lede van die akademiese personeel. My ondervinding is dat daar wel dosente is wat soms buite hulle opdrag van onderrig en ondersoek en opvoeding beweeg en probeer om jong seuns en jong dogters aan ons universiteite te verlei deur onverantwoordelike dade te pleeg. Niemand van ons wil studente hul gesonde studentelewe ontneem nie. Ons wil ook geen student daarvan weerhou om werklik aktief in die studentepolitiek, sover dit deel vorm van die bre&#x00EB; politiek, belang te stel nie. Mens kry egter gevalle soos di&#x00E9; van Rooi Daan&#x2014;hy is geen familie van my nie&#x2014;en wat hy by die universiteit van Parys gedoen het. &#x2019;n Mens weet dat die kommuniste hierdie kampusse nie sal laat vryspring nie. Hier in Suid-Afrika het studente onlangs selfs die Suid-Afrikaanse vlag verbrand. Aan sommige van ons universiteite is daar klein groepies militante en onverantwoordelike studente. Ek sal graag vanjaar of volgende jaar van die agb. Minister wil weet hoeveel van hierdie studente van die buiteland af kom en nie Suid-Afrikaanse burgers is nie.</p>

<p>In die lig van al hierdie dinge dink ek dat die Parlement baie sterk standpunt moet inneem ten opsigte van onverantwoordelike en onpatriotiese optrede op ons kampusse. Ek dink ons is dit almal eens wat hierdie aangeleentheid betref. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat die agb. Minister aan hierdie standpunt wat ingeneem is, aandag sal skenk. Dit is waar dat die NP en die Amptelike Opposisie oor ons beskouing van die universiteitswese prin-sipieel verskil. Veral in die situasie waarin Suid-Afrika hom bevind, met sy veelvolkig-heid&#x2014;waarop ek nie wil ingaan nie&#x2014;en dies meer, wil ek aan die universiteite wat gegroei het uit my volksmilieu s&#x00EA; dat ons baie streng moet waak oor die handhawing van die soewereiniteit van ons universiteite.

<from><span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0158"/>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. P. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, waar ek die agb. lid vir Rissik opvolg, is dit vir my aangenaam om sekere van die gedagtes wat hy uitgespreek het, te deel aan-gesien ekself in die studentepolitiek betrokke was. Ek steun graag die opmerk-ings wat hy in hierdie verband gemaak het.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook praat oor &#x2019;n onderwerp wat aansluit by die universiteitswese, en meer bepaald oor die salarisposisie van universiteitsdosente.. Ter aanvang wil ek graag s&#x00EA; dat ek nie dink ons kan toelaat dat &#x2019;n korps universiteitsdosente &#x2019;n bedingingsmasjinerie skep, soos deur sekere mense bepleit word, nie. Uit sommige oorde word daar ligtelik verwys na die behoefte aan &#x2019;n vakvereniging vir universiteitsdosente. Dit word miskien nie ernstig bedoel nie, maar die uitlating word tog soms gemaak. Ek dink nie ons kan dit toelaat nie, want indien dit wel toegelaat word, sal dit die land en die doserende personeel tot nadeel strek. As so iets gebeur, sal dit &#x2019;n ewige proses van agitasie op tou sit, wat die indruk sal laat dat dit die enigste metode is om beter salarisse te beding. Dit sal ook die beeld van die dosent skade berokken en meebring dat die status van die universiteitsdosent daaronder ly.</p>

<p>Ek glo egter ook, in alle billikheid en reg-verdigheid, dat daar &#x2019;n saak uit te maak is vir die universiteitsdosent, veral as &#x2019;n mens let op sy huidige salarisposisie. Ek dink dit het nodig geword dat ons ook van ons kant af ons saak sal stel met betrekking tot hierdie aangeleentheid. Dit sal vir die dosent hier in die Parlement &#x2019;n bedingingsgrondslag skep en voorkom dat daar na ander metodes van bedinging gesoek word.</p>

<p>Die oorsprong van die huidige klagtes wat daar in die universiteitsgeledere geopper word, is die o&#x00EB;nskynlik oneweredige verhoging van salarisse van universiteitsdosente teenoor onderwysers. Onvleiende opmerk-ings word in hierdie verband gemaak oor sekere bevindings van die Venterkommissie. Ek wil nie op daardie bewerings ingaan nie, want ek dink nie dit is gepas om hulle te bespreek nie. Ek wil egter verwys na sommige van die bewerings wat gemaak word om die standpunt van die universiteitsdosent te staaf. Daar word ges&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n hoof P 2 &#x2019;n maksimum salaris kry wat gelykstaande is aan di&#x00E9; van &#x2019;n lektor aan &#x2019;n uni-versiteit. Ons vind egter dat die maksimum salaris van &#x2019;n hoof P 1 of van &#x2019;n hoof S 2 gelyk is aan di&#x00E9; van &#x2019;n mede-professor. Die salaris van &#x2019;n professor is maar R1 800 meer as di&#x00E9; van &#x2019;n hoof P 1 en &#x2019;n hoof S 1. Nou s&#x00EA; die mense wat hierdie punte opper dat daar van &#x2019;n professor en &#x2019;n mede-professor verwag word om ten minste &#x2019;n D-graad agter sy naam te kan skryf, met verdere bewys van nagraadse navorsing, publikasies wat onder sy pen verskyn het en ander bydraes wat hy op die studie-en navorsingvlak gemaak het.</p>

<p>Hierdie faktore bring mee dat ons op die oomblik onmin het in die universiteitsdosen-tekorps. Ek dink egter nie dat dit nodig is dat ons hierdie punt verder ontleed nie. Die agb. Minister het reeds verwys na sekere bevindings van die Van Wyk-De Vries-kommissie oor die rol van die universiteit as sodanig. Hy het hom ook uitgelaat oor die bevinding van die kommissie oor die universiteit as die leier van die onderwys in die land. Ek wil egter graag ook die volgende bevinding van die kommissie in 1974, aanhaal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indien dit waar is dat die universiteit op alle belangrike lewensvlakke &#x2019;n funksie het, is dit dubbel waar dat hy dit in &#x2019;n be-sondere sin het op die terrein van die skool, want hy is skool nommer een in alle ontwikkellende lande ter w&#x00EA;reld.</block>

<p>Voorts word daar ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Aan die universiteit word dus daagliks gewerk met die onderwys en opvoeding in sy volle omvang en word steeds kennis geneem van wat in die w&#x00EA;reld op hierdie gebied aangaan.</block>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. P. MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, voor die verdaging het ek ges&#x00EA; dat die onmin wat rondom die salarisposisie van universiteitsdosente bestaan toegeskryf kan word aan die oneweredigheid in die aanpassing van hul salarisse gemeet aan di&#x00E9; van onderwysers. Die afleiding wat daarvan gemaak word is dat &#x2019;n professor wat oor &#x2019;n doktorsgraad beskik op dieselfde salarisvlak is as, byvoorbeeld, &#x2019;n skoolhoof wat oor &#x2019;n B-graad beskik en wat vir &#x2019;n verdere jaar vir &#x2019;n onderwysdiploma <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0159"/>gestudeer het. Die vraag is dan net: Kan ons hierdie toestand laat voortduur aangesien die universiteit, volgens die bevinding van die Van Wyk-De Vrieskommissie, inderdaad die leier van die onderwys in die land is, nie net van tersi&#x00EA;re onderwys nie, maar ook van die totale onderwys van &#x2019;n land. Dit kan tot gevolg h&#x00EA; dat die gehalte van universiteitsdosente daaronder ly tensy ons ewewigtig kyk na die posisie van universiteitsdosente se salaris. Dit kan aangevoer word dat so &#x2019;n persoon vanwe&#x00EB; sy liefde vir sy vakgebied, in elk geval die universiteit as sy loopbaan sou kies. Dit is waar, maar ons het ook vroe&#x00EB;r gevind dat hierdie argument in die geval van die onderwyser nie steek gehou het nie en dit was uiteindelik op die onderwysers se aandrang dat ondersoek na hul posisie in-gestel is. Teen daardie agtergrond wil ek &#x2019;n pleidooi vir die posisie van die universiteitsdosent lewer.</p>

<p>Na ons dit alles ges&#x00EA; het, voer dit &#x2019;n mens terug na die taak van die universiteitsdosent veral ten opsigte van sy gemeenskapsdiens. Die agb. Minister het vroe&#x00EB;r na daardie taak verwys as een van die drie wat onder meer op die weg l&#x00EA; van die universiteitsdosent. Ek wil daarby aansluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat die funksie van die universiteitsdosent ten opsigte van die gemeenskap sterker oorweging moet geniet. Ons verkeer in &#x2019;n situasie waar ons in elk geval te min opgeleide mense het om die werk in Suid-Afrika te doen. Ons kan nie bekostig om &#x2019;n situasie by universiteite te h&#x00EA;&#x2014;en ek s&#x00EA; nie dit is so nie want daar is mense wat baie hard werk&#x2014;dat mense ledig sit terwyl hulle &#x2019;n substansi&#x00EB;le bydrae in die privaatsektor of in die owerheidsektor kon lewer om sodoende leemtes en gapings in ons mannekragbehoefte aan te vul. Die agb. lid vir Standerton het ook vroe&#x00EB;r uitgewys hoe ons van die professionele man gebruik kan maak. Ek wil baie sterk daarby aansluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat dit ook omgekeerd moontlik waar kan wees, want ons kan voltydse dosente aan universiteite op &#x2019;n deeltydse grondslag in beide die privaatsektor en die owerheidsektor aanwend. Maar ons kan nie toelaat dat universiteitsdosente met bevooroordeelde standpunte daardie bydrae kom maak nie. Ons het voorbeelde daarvan en ek dink nie dit is nodig om daarop uit te wei nie, maar miskien moet ek &#x2019;n enkele voorbeeld aanhaal om die punt wat ek probeer maak, te staaf. Die kandidaat van die amp-telike Opposisie wat teen my gestaan het in die onlangse algemene verkiesing is &#x2019;n voltydse dosent aan die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand. Daardie universiteit het hom toegelaat om met sy werk by die universiteit voort te gaan die dag voor en na die verkiesing, terwyl hy slegs op die dag van die ver-kiesing &#x2019;n onderbreking gehad het. By die Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit het ons die situasie dat &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ek probeer &#x2019;n voorbeeld aanhaal want ek dink nie dat &#x2019;n universiteit wat prim&#x00EA;r in diens van die gemeenskap is en wat per slot van rekening in &#x2019;n sekere sin as &#x2019;n staatsondersteunde lig-gaam beskou kan word, hom kan laat regeer of laat lei in sy rol wat hy in die gemeenskap moet speel deur standpunte wat by voorbaat ingeneem word deur persone wat vooropgestelde idees het oor die rol wat hulle moet kom vervul nie. Waar ons dus vra dat alle universiteite aan hierdie gemeenskapsdiens moet kom deelneem, kan ons nie toelaat dat bevooroordeelde standpunte ingeneem word in verband met bepaalde sake in die gemeenskap nie.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek volg graag op die agb. lid vir Johan-nesburg-Wes en ek meen dat die agb. Minister hom sinvol sal kan antwoord op sy betoog.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag my gelukwensinge aan die agb. Minister oordra vir die pragtige wyse waarop hy baie sterk lyne getrek het tydens sy eerste debat in sy nuwe Pos en ek wil hom baie sterkte toewens vir die pragtige ideale wat die onderwysberoep vir hom sien en die sterk wyse waarop hulle na hom opsien om leiding te gee in hierdie Departement. Aansluitend by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes wil ek enkele gedagtes <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0160"/>uitspreek oor die onderwyser as gemeenskapsmens. Ek laat my lei deur &#x2019;n baie mooi uitlating van prof. Nico van Loggerenberg, die voorsitter van die SAOR. Hy het die volgende van die onderwyser ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die status en aansien van die onderwyser word verwerf op grond van professionele effektiwiteit in die lewe van elke dag.</block>

<p>Voordat ek na die dag van die onderwyser kyk wil ek eers kyk na wat hy as onderwys-man in 1979 self vir horn as credo vir sy beroep in die gemeenskap gestel het. Daarin omskryf hierdie onderwyser sy eie taak soos volg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die onderwyser aanvaar die beginsel dat die skool in diens van die gemeenskap staan en respekteer die gebruike en kodes van die gemeenskap in soverre dit opvoedkundig verantwoordbaar is. Twee-dens aanvaar hy sy verantwoordelikhede as lid van sy professie wat leiding aan sy gemeenskap moet gee in verband met gesindheidsvorming en die bevordering van die opvoeding asook sy persoonlike betrokkenheid by plaaslike en burgerlike aangeleenthede. Derdens erken hy dat die onderwysprofessie &#x2019;n openbare vertrouensposisie beklee waarby nie alleen die persoonlike gedrag van die individuele onderwyser betrek is nie, maar ook die wisselwerkingsverband tussen skool en gemeenskap en dat sy handelinge en gedrag daarom sodanig moet wees dat dit die agting van die gemeenskap afdwing en die beeld van die professie versterk.</block>

<p>In hierdie pragtig omskrewe taak van die onderwyser&#x2014;en hy het vir hom &#x2019;n baie moeilike taak omskryf&#x2014;wil ek graag &#x2019;n kykie in die dag van so &#x2019;n onderwyser neem. Enige skoolhoof wat sy sout werd is sal self sy kantoordeur om 07h15 oopsluit, want teen daardie tyd het die eerste ouers alreeds op pad werk toe hul kinders by die skool afgelaai en loop daardie seuns en dogters op &#x2019;n onbewaakte terrein rond voordat die skoolklok om tien voor ag lui. Die eerste onderwysers, ongeag of hulle wetenskap, biologie of huishoudkunde doseer, daag teen daardie tyd by die skool op vir die voorbereiding en opstelling van hul wetenskapproewe en ook vir die uitsit van hul beno-digdhede vir die praktiese werk in huishoudkunde. Om &#x2019;n aanduiding van die gesindheid van hierdie mense te gee, kan ek aan u s&#x00EA;, mnr. die Voorsitter, dat so &#x2019;n onderwyseres met haar kinders sal re&#x00EB;l om reeds halfag vrywillig met hul skoolwerk te begin omdat twee periodes praktiese werk vir so &#x2019;n kind nie voldoende is om les te gee, die praktiese werk te doen, te evalueer, op te ruim en gereed te wees vir die derde periode se Afrikaans en wiskunde nie. So &#x2019;n skoolhoof kan verwag dat die res van sy akademiese personeel in daardie stadium op die skoolterrein aangekom het. Ek s&#x00EA; dit omdat hierdie mense gewoonlik getipeer word as mense wat ses uur &#x2019;n dag werk vir vyf dae van die week en vir ses maande van die jaar terwyl hulle sewe maande vakansie het. Die onderwysers word gevolg deur die administratiewe personeel wat eintlik om agtuur op kantoor moet wees en net van agtuur af betaal word, maar in daardie stadium is hulle reeds daar omdat kinders navraag kom doen by die skoolkantoor. Ook die akademiese personeel is in daardie stadium op hul pos. Die ouergemeenskap begin in daardie stadium skakel. Moontlik was &#x2019;n vader daardie nag in &#x2019;n ernstige ongeluk of miskien was dit &#x2019;n ander vader wat nie huis toe gekom het nie. Dit kan ook &#x2019;n moeder wees wat ernstig siek geword het of &#x2019;n kind uit &#x2019;n gebroke gesin wat huis toe gegaan het en wat daardie nag sy tol ge&#x00EB;is het. Moontlik kan dit &#x2019;n kind wees wat daardie dag sonder dat hy behoorlik ge&#x00EB;et het, na die skool toe gekom het.</p>

<p>Ek verwys na hierdie dinge om ek later daarop wil terugkom. Dit is ook so dat hierdie skoolhoof, indien hy sy sout werd is, voorsitter is van die gemeenskapslewe waarin hy staan. Hy kan die voorsitter van verskillende organisasies wees, organisasies wat in daardie stadium vir hom skakel oor die werkstaat van die dag. Wanneer die skoolklok om 10 voor 8 lui en die onderwyser ontmoet sy eerste klasgroep wat uit tussen 25 en 40 kinders kan bestaan, het hy te doen met die totale omstandighede waaronder daardie kind na die klaskamer kom. Dit is nie &#x2019;n kwessie van boeke uithaal en begin les gee nie. Elke kind is &#x2019;n individu op sy eie met &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van prestasievermo&#x00EB;ns, met sy eie wel en wee in sy hart, die hartseer waarvan ek netnou gepraat het, maar ook moontlik die geluk wat in hierdie nag op sy <span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0161"/>pad gekom het. So &#x2019;n kind kom met verskillende stemminge daar aan. Hy kom met al die verskeidenhede wat die Liewe Heer die mens gemaak het en hulle verwag dat elkeen as &#x2019;n individu deur daardie leerkrag gehanteer moet word. Hy kan nie in die bondel praat nie en hy moet sy les so aanbied dat hy die groep as groep hanteer. Hierdie onderwyser is nie net kennisbreker nie, maar ook opvoeder, hy is nie alleen die ontwikkelaar van &#x2019;n studiepatroon nie, maar ook karaktervormer. Hy is nie net rasionalis nie, maar ook sedebewaker. Sy program wissel vir 10 periodes, elke keer met tussen 25 en 40 verskillende kinders. As hy daarna sy werk sinvol wil verrig, sal hy na twee uur met &#x2019;n sekere groep landers na die buitemuurse aktiwi-teite van sy skool gaan waar hy, hetsy in &#x2019;n sportprogram, hetsy in &#x2019;n kulturele program of watter vorm van persoonlike aandag ook al, die aandag wat hy in formele vorm in die klas gehad het hier in die informele omstandighede behou en sy taak as opvoeder voort-sit om sekere ander patrone vas te l&#x00EA; in die lewe van hierdie kind wat op sy weg vir hierdie dag gekom het. Hierdie patroon volg hy tot vier uur vanmiddag en dan wend hy hom vir die eerste keer na sy huis. Sewe-uur vanaand is hy ὸf betrokke by sy diakenwerk van die kerk ὸf hy is betrokke by een of ander vorm van kulturele aktiwiteit want hy is &#x2019;n gemeenskapsmens en as &#x2019;n onderwyser &#x2019;n gesiene mens en die man wat op die komitees van sy dorp dien. Hierdie proses hou aan tot in die omgewing van nege-uur vanaand wanneer hy vir die eerste keer met sy gesin kan verenig omdat hy ook &#x2019;n gesinsman is. Hy het sy eie vrou en kinders en hulle wil ook alleen wees. Hulle wil ook deel h&#x00EA; aan hierdie vorm van intimiteit van &#x2019;n huisgesin wat elkeen vir homself gun. Hulle wil ook &#x2019;n rustige oomblik h&#x00EA; waarin hulle saam kan boekevat as gesin of net kan dink aan hul eie lotgevalle. Moontlik wil hulle net saam die humor van die dag beleef, saamlag, of net rustig ontspan. Daar is egter nie tyd daarvoor nie want vir die eerste keer kom hy nou by die evalu&#x00EB;ring van die werk van die dag in sy klaskamer. Hy moet voorbereid wees vir die dag van m&#x00F4;re. Hy moet toetse vir die dag van m&#x00F4;re opstel en weer vir daardie dag begin gereed maak. Dit is vir hierdie mense wat ek pleit want indien een van hulle op hierdie paadjie hom dalk sou vergryp, speel die pers met hom asof hy &#x2019;n doodgewone nuusmiddel van die dag is. Ek s&#x00EA; dit met groot pi&#x00EB;teit vir die werk wat die pers doen, maar ons sien hom nie in hierdie perspektief wanneer ons oor sy foute van gister skryf nie. Dit is hierdie man wat, in die stremmende omstandighede waaronder hy werk, moontlik &#x2019;n lat gevat het en &#x2019;n seuntjie daar in die klas deurgeloop het&#x2014;waar hy verdien het om gestraf te word omdat dit die plek van sy oortreding was&#x2014;deur beletsels en sekere verordeninge beperk word want dit bepaal dat hy nie daar mag straf nie. Indien ek in my dae in &#x2019;n klaskamer oortree het, het ek daar my pak slae gekry en ek is dikwels voor dogters geslaan. Dit het my baie goed gedoen en ek het geweet dat ek nie weer daardie oortreding moet begaan nie. Vandag is hierdie soort dinge van hom weggeneem en word sy hande vasgehou. Dit is vir hierdie mense wat ek pleit as ek vra: Word sy program nie nog verder oorlaai met die versameling van statistiek, met die invul van vorms en onnodige administratiewe werk nie? In die praktyk weet ek dat so min van hierdie dinge weggeneem kan word want die uitmaak van die rapport aan die ouer is sy persoonlike belewenis. Hy kan dit nie deur iemand anders laat doen nie. Die instel van die persoonlike l&#x00EA;rstel van die skool is iets wat hy nie aan &#x2019;n administratiewe persoon kan oordra nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het vanmiddag &#x2019;n paar woorde gespreek oor die beeld van die onderwyser. Hy het aan ons ges&#x00EA; dat die beeld van die onderwys oor die jare heen verswak het.

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Ek dink daardie agb. lid is reg. Ons kan onsself herinner hoe die Opposisie oor die jare heen aftakelend en neerhalend van die onderwys gepraat het. Ek dink nie dat hy vir ons daarvan kan be-skuldig dat ons die beeld van die onderwyser aftakel nie. Ek dink dat ons almal &#x2019;n taak en &#x2019;n plig het om aan die beeld van die onderwys te bou. Die agb. lid vir Pinelands het ook beswaar gemaak teen die sogenaamde dreigement van die agb. Minister van Nasionale Opvoeding sover dit die subsidies aan universiteite betref. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die agb. Minister die universiteite sou gedreig het dat hulle nie meer subsidies sou kry nie. Indien die dissipline by &#x2019;n uni-versiteit egter sodanig is dat diegene wat daar is om te studeer, begin om vlae te verbrand, het dit tyd geword dat die agb. Minister, wat daar is om te waak oor die besteding van staatsgeld, system dik maak en hierdie mense waarsku. Die agb. lid het ook die moontlikheid genoem dat die agb. Minister die geld wat aan subsidies betaal word, sou terughou. Indien universiteite wat daargestel is met die geld van belastingbetalers weier om aan die Republiekfeeskomitee fasiliteite beskikbaar te stel wat met die geld van belastingbetalers gebou is, dink ek dat die agb. Minister geregverdig is om daaroor navraag te doen.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pietermaritzburg-Suid, wat nie nou in die Raad is nie&#x2014;ek meen hy is in die Ander Plek waar hy besig is met &#x2019;n debat&#x2014;het vanmiddag te kenne gegee, en die ander agb. lede van die Opposisie het daarmee saamgestem, dat die probleme wat by ons kampusse ontstaan net by die etniesgerigte kampusse sou ontstaan. Dit is soos ek hom verstaan het en ek hoop nie dat ek hom verkeerd verstaan het nie. Dit is mos nou snert want ons moet net kyk waar die moeilikhede in Suid-Afrika is. Is dit by die Universiteit van Pretoria? Is dit by die Universiteit van Potchefstroom? [Tussenwerpsels.] Nee, die moeilikhede is ook nie by die Universiteit van Stellenbosch nie, maar kom ons s&#x00EA; maar waar die moeilikhede is. Mnr. die Voorsit-ter, u weet mos waar hulle ons vlae verbrand. Dit is by die Universiteit van die Wit-watersrand. Ons sien mos nou watter universiteite se kampusse het deesdae broeiplekke van ondermynende elemente teen die Staat geword. Dit is nie by die Universiteit van Stellenbosch of by die Universiteit van Pretoria nie. Hierdie doktrine wat s&#x00EA; dat al die moeilikhede in die lug sal verdwyn &#x2026;</p>

<p>Wat van Potchefstroom?</p>

<speech by="#vlok">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, ons moet nie Potchefstroom uitlaat nie. Hierdie doktrine van die liberaliste wat s&#x00EA; dat alles &#x201E;rosy dosy&#x201D; sal wees as jy alles net oop gooi, is nie waar nie. Ons vind dat daardie doktrine dood is en hulle moet dit maar liewer daar laat. In die debat wat ons tot dusver in hierdie Komitee gevoer het, het twee aspekte baie duidelik na vore gekom, en dit is eerstens totale verbintenis van die agb. Eerste Minister, van hierdie agb. Minister en die Regering aan die beginsel van Christelik-Nasionale opvoeding. Dit is &#x2019;n onverhandelbare beginsel waarvan ons nie bereid is om af te wyk nie, en daarvoor is daar oorvloedige getuienis. Die allesgelykmakende en afgewaterde onderwysstelsel wat die PFP vir Suid-Afrika bepleit, sal slegs ingestel word wanneer hulle hierdie land regeer en dit sal nooit gebeur nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daarvoor is ons mense te verstandig en hulle stel te &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; prys op die behoud van d&#x00ED;t wat vir ons van belang is.</p>

<p>In die tweede plek het die agb. Eerste Minister en die Regering met die hantering van die probleme wat in die onderwys bestaan het, afdoende sigbare bewys gelewer van die baie ho&#x00EB; prioriteit wat tereg aan die onderwys in ons volkshuishouding gegee moet word. Hierdie is die hoekstene van ons onderwysstelsel en as daarmee ten spyte van groot druk, volhard word, voorspel dit slegs goed vir hierdie land van ons, want die deurslaggewende rol wat onderwysers in die vorming van &#x2019;n kind speel, is oorbekend en het geen verdere betoog nodig nie. Almal van ons wat vanaand hier sit, kan getuig dat daardie onderwyser wat ons geleer het hoe om by die lewe aan te pas en ook hoe om die eise van die lewe te hanteer, di&#x00E9; onderwyser is aan wie ons vandag nog met deemoed <span class="col_303-304" refersTo="page_0163"/>terugdink. Daardie onderwyser wat ons geleer het, al was dit nie sy vak nie, om volledig mens te wees in diensbaarheid en verantwoordelikheidsin, hom vergeet jy nooit. Waar Suid-Afrika vandag aan die vooraand van &#x2019;n nuwe tydvak in ons geskiedenis staan, is die taak van ons onderwysers om ons kinders positief vir die onafwendbare en opwindende veranderinge voor te berei van die allergrootste belang. Hulle moet ook voorberei word op veranderinge op tegnologiese gebied, maar ook op die terreine van menseverhoudings, en vreedsame naasbe-staan met behoud van alles wat eiendomlik aan jou volk is, maar met aanvaarding van die feit dat daar ook ander volke en volks-groepe in dieselfde land woonagtig is. Dit bring nuwe eise en groter verantwoordelik-heid vir ons. Ons jeug moet leer om hierdie eise en nuwe verantwoordelikhede as uitdagings te aanvaar en ons onderwysers het &#x2019;n sleutelrol om in hierdie verband te speel. Hulle, die onderwysers van Suid-Afrika, Blank, Swart en Bruin, kan van ons jong mense verantwoordelike, diensbare mense maak, verantwoordelik teenoor ons vaderland en diensbaar aan ons mense en aan ons vaderland. Laat ons onderwysers dit nou maar weet, want dit is waar: D&#x00ED;t wat hulle vandag in Suid-Afrika saai, sal hulle saam met ons pluk. As hulle distels en dorings saai, kan hulle nie verwag om koring te maai nie. As hulle haat en nyd in die harte van ons kinders plant, kan hulle ook nie verwag om liefde en toegeneentheid te oes nie. Ons en hulle is saam in hierdie bootjie en ons kan nie daaraan ontsnap nie. Ons sal almal, Swart, Wit en Bruin, &#x00F2;f hier in vrede voortleef &#x00F2;f ons gaan almal onder in verskriklike geweld en bloedvergieting. As dit ons eras is en ons opreg in ons optrede is, kan ons onderwyskorps in hierdie taak &#x2019;n deurslagge-wende rol speel in die bepaling van ons toekoms. Daarom is die wel en die wee van die onderwyser vir ons van die allergrootste belang. Sedert die gewysigde bedeling vir ons onderwysers in werking getree het, het ek &#x2019;n spesiale punt daarvan gemaak om met ons onderwyskorps in my kiesafdeling te beraadslaag. Hoewel daar nog sekere knelpunte is, is daar deur die bank opregte dankbaarheid en waardering vir die verbetering van hul vergoedingsbedeling, salarisse, sowel as die struktuurverbeteringe wat gekom het. My mense voel dat hierdie agb. Minister vertrou kan word met onder meer die belofte aan hulle dat daar voortdurend deurlopend aandag aan die posisie van die onderwyser gegee sal word. Dit is &#x2019;n geweldige stap vorentoe en dit kan meehelp om te verseker dat die positiewe klimaat wat daar tans bestaan, voortgesit word. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, is daar nog sekere knelpunte waaraan aandag geskenk kan word. As gevolg van &#x2019;n gebrek aan tyd, sal ek net na enkeles verwys. Ek wil graag vra of die behuisingsubsidie aan ongetroude mans sowel as aan broodwinner-dames nie ook oorweeg kan word nie. Baie dankie dat die Regering die onderskeid wat gemaak is tussen mans en dames met dieselfde kwalifikasies en wat in dieselfde poste dien, maar verskillende salarisse ontvang, gaan afskaf. &#x2019;n Derde puntjie waarna ek wil verwys is die staatgesubsidieerde motorskema wat op sekere beamptes in die Staats-diens wat bo &#x2019;n sekere salariskerf is, van toepassing is en ek wil vra dat hierdie skema ook vir onderwysers ingestel word.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek wil graag net kortliks verwys na die paar sake waarop ek nog nie geantwoord het nie sover dit die agb. lid vir Pinelands se toespraak betref. Eerstens was daar die vraag in verband met die Nasionale Studiebeurs en Leningsfonds.</p>

<p>This fund was instituted, in terms of the <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0164"/>Act which provides for it, for the specific purpose of providing study loans and bursaries for students who are in need of financial assistance, rather than for students who have achieved merit in respect of academic excellence. Originally the donor was left the liberty to designate both the institution to which the donation should be made and also, if he so wished, a specific student to whom it should be applied. The liberty to designate the institution has remained unimpaired, but the designation of the student has been withdrawn for the simple reason that this freedom was abused in the sense that firms provided this kind of bursary specifically for employees who did not on the whole always qualify as people in need of financial assistance. Therefore the policy is that the institution may be designated, and in that case the donation is transferred immediately from the fund to the institution, but the institution should be left the freedom to decide which individual student should qualify for this. I can say from my personal experience at the RAU that this restriction is really quite essential, because we experienced cases where this freedom was put to improper use as far as designating specific beneficiaries is concerned.</p>

<p>How has this affected the Fund? Has it not reduced it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it has affected the Fund. There has been an overall decrease in the contributions to the Fund mainly, I think, because the universities did not like contributions being made via the department. They preferred to do their own fund-raising more directly and canvass the support of the firm for the direct benefit of the university. However, the Treasury has been asked to supplement this Fund in order to strengthen it and in order to provide universities with a continuing form of support.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#boraine">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Is it not a fact that donations given directly to the university are not tax deductible, whereas these are. My main concern is that the Fund should not suffer.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Both donations to the university and to this Fund are tax deductible to the same extent. There is no difference whatsoever. I think the basic reason why the department did not continue as it did in the past to have a full-time official to raise donations for this Fund was because the universities indicated that they preferred to undertake their own fund-raising to gain funds directly for the university concerned.</p>

<p>Another point raised by the hon. member for Pinelands dealt with recruitment. He emphasized that this was a major probleem and I would like to agree with him here and assure the Committee that I had special discussions with the Administrators and the Directors of Education to ask them, especially now that we have a better salary deal, to make a concerted effort, possibly by the use of sophisticated methods, to induce students and pupils to take up the teaching profession.</p>

<p>I think that in the past people have often worked on the wrong assumption that the pupil knows the teaching profession because he is daily exposed to teachers. Unfortunately, on the one hand all teachers are not equally positive in encouraging their pupils to take up the profession and on the other hand pupils in fact do not always know the challenges and the attractiveness and even positive aspects of the conditions of service, e.g. the very generous pension scheme, which are attached to this profession. I therefore appeal to the provincial departments not to assume that students know the profession but to make a special effort to introduce the profession to pupils in a more positive and more planned way. I have been given the assurance that this matter will receive attention.</p>

<p>I should like to follow up what the hon. member for Rissik had to say in reply to the hon. member for Pineland&#x2019;s remark about the alleged large percentage of foreigners on the teaching staff of some universities. First of all, the assurance has been given by the universities named by the members of the President&#x2019;s Council that in fact the percentage of foreigners is much lower than was indicated. I think that the percentage mentioned by members of the President&#x2019;s Council was between 60&#x0025; and 70&#x0025; while it is in fact not more than at the most 25&#x0025; or 26&#x0025;. As the hon. member for Rissik indicated, there is no objection in principle to having foreign scholars on our campuses. In fact, we encourage and welcome the exchange of <span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_0165"/>knowledge, experience and expertise between our own campuses and campuses abroad. In the same way some of our scholars like to spend sabbatical years, or a period of time under contract or through some appointment, on campuses in other countries. I should, however, like to state very emphatically that, irrespective of whether the staff member is a foreigner or a South African citizen, if he indulges in subversive activities, he will be dealt with in the same efficient way which we are accustomed to expect from our Police and especially our Security Police. However, at this stage I have no reason to believe that there is a greater risk of political activism or improper activities on the part of foreign members of staff than on the part of staff members who are South African citizens. I can assure the Committee that in this regard we have a very frank and open relationship with the university authorities and that the matter will be kept under observation.</p>

<p>As regards the alleged threat of the withdrawal of subsidies, I should first of all like to draw the Committee&#x2019;s attention to the Universities Act, No. 61 of 1955, which dates many years back. I think it was originally formulated way back in the early 1920s. In this Act specific provision is made in sections 25 and 26 that the Minister may lay down such conditions in respect of each university, i.e. individually in respect of universities, as he deems fit. He can then require universities to comply with such conditions. If the university then does not comply with those conditions, he can follow a certain procedure whereby he can withhold the whole subsidy or a part of the subsidy. I fully agree that it would be a sorry day if we had to withhold a part of the subsidy to a university. I say this in all seriousness. This does not mean, however, that this section in the Act is an empty and meaningless section. If it is necessary to apply it, it can and will be applied. This is not a threat, but merely a statement of fact.</p>

<p>I should also like to remind the Committee that it is not only the Government that has pointed out to the universities that they should put their house in order so as to ensure continued support from public funds. The private sector, too, was very frank and outspoken in this respect in that, as a result of certain events which took place on specific campuses, there was a very general withdrawal of financial support for those universities by the private sector which had traditionally supported them. It is therefore not only the evil and wicked Government which has pointed in this direction, but it was in fact also concretely applied by the supporters of the universities in the private sector.</p>

<p>I should also like to make it very clear that the actions which took place on the campuses and to which objection was registered by the Government through myself and my colleague the hon. Minister of Finance were actions which were completely unrelated to the question of academic freedom. It is therefore completely wrong to suggest that the action on the part of the Government is a threat to academic freedom. The actions concerned affected the political opinions and attitude of the members of those campuses and were, as I have said, completely unrelated to the question of academic freedom. No member of a university, be he a student or a staff member, is entitled to different treatment on the part of the security authorities or the political authorities in this State from that which any other citizen in this State is entitled to. I think both sides of the House will agree on this point and it is in this spirit that we shall continue to look into this matter.</p>

<p>I should like to mention that after discussions with the universities concerned&#x2014;in fact, the matter was already taken in hand before the discussions were proposed&#x2014;we were satisfied that the universities did in fact pay serious attention and apply disciplinary measures to people who transgressed in this respect. In the case of one university this resulted in specific convictions by the university&#x2019;s court and fines were imposed upon the students. This was in respect of the burning of the Republic festival flag. In the case of the University of the Witwatersrand we were given indications of a very serious investigation into the matter, which did, however, not succeed in identifying guilty individuals who were in fact registered students of the university. The case involved persons who were not students and one who was a former student, and the university went to the trouble of asking for a writ of tresspass against this student from the courts in order to prevent him from further imposing his unwanted presence on the campus. We are <span class="col_309-310" refersTo="page_0166"/>therefore satisfied that the universities took the matter in hand. We also received from the universities an assurance of the kind the hon. member for Verwoerdburg referred to, namely that they would in future make the university facilities available for national events, provided of course those facilities are not at the time required for their own internal purposes&#x2014;that is perfectly fair.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek baie graag met waardering verwys na die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Virginia. Ook hy het in sy toespraak waar hy dit oor die onderwyser gehad het, klem gel&#x00EA; op die belangrikheid van werwing en op die vraag van hoe die professie homself verkoop. Ek het reeds enkele opmerkings daaroor gemaak, maar ek wil hier saam met die agb. lid vir Virginia op ons kollegas in die onderwys, as ek hulle in historiese sin so kan noem, werklik &#x2019;n beroep doen om deur hul styl van optrede voor hul leerlinge en deur die manier waaroor hulle oor hul eie professie praat, &#x2019;n gunstige en positiewe beeld van die professie voor te hou en daartoe by te dra dat die leerlinge wel aangemoedig sal word om hulle vir hierdie professie te kwalifiseer. Ek wil graag ook met die agb. lid vir Virginia saamstem dat die wyse van opleiding van onderwysers aan die universiteit baie belangrik is. Ek stem met hom saam dat daar &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie geplaas moet word op &#x2019;n kombinasie van akademiese en praktiese opleiding. Daarom dink ek persoonlik dat die universiteite wat in die plek van die ou metode van die verwerf van &#x2019;n graad gevolg deur die behaal van die ho&#x00EB;r onderwysdiploma, &#x2019;n gekombineerde vierjarige kursus in-gestel het waarin die onderwysersopleiding van die eerste jaar af saam met die akademiese opleiding loop en hulle ge&#x00EF;ntegreerd met mekaar aangebied word, &#x2019;n belangrike en voordelige vemuwing in die onderwys ingevoer het. Ek wil dit egter ook as my oortuiging stel dat &#x2019;n onderwyser nooit klaar opgelei is nie en dat voortgesette opleiding, indiensopleiding, aanvullende opleiding en ook voortgesette studie vir die onderwyser van die grootste belang is. Dit is dan ook om daardie rede dat, terwyl die kategoriedifferensiasie volgens kwalifikasies vir die onderwys in die bevorderingsvlakke verwyder is, dit wel gehandhaaf word op die vlak waar die onderwyser in die klaskamer staan, die eerste en tweede posvlakke vir die onderwyser en die departementshoof onderskeidelik. Dit is omdat voortgesette studie en deurlopende bekwaammaking vir die onderwyser van baie, baie groot belang is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban North made a variety of remarks to some of which I have already referred. I agree with his remarks about the importance of education as a human right which society owes to the individual. I would give him the assurance that it is in this spirit that the Government is doing its level best to improve the level of educational services for all population groups and to achieve, within the limits of what is possible, a parity of quality of educational services for all South Africans, as was set out in the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s request to the Human Sciences Research Council when he asked them to start with their investigations.</p>

<p>The whole question of subsidies to private schools is a matter on which provinces differ, as the hon. member for Durban North himself pointed out. I am sure that this is a matter that will come up again for discussion and consideration as a result of the HSRC or De Lange investigation. I should like to emphasize that in my opinion, as I have said before, the private sector has a very important contribution to make to the promotion of education in this country by way of, <i>inter alia</i>, its support of private schools, and that it is fair to expect of the State to supplement that support, as is done in most of the provinces. The position in Transvaal was that, while they also provided subsidies, at a certain stage they decided to freeze the position and to continue with subsidies only for schools which at that stage qualified. I should like to mention here my appreciation of the quality of work and innovative character of many private schools. I should also like to emphasize the degree of parent commitment which they manage to achieve. At the same time I think it should be emphasized that private schools, like all other schools, should meet the requirement of a high standard of loyalty to the country. I do not think it would be improper to refer to the remark made by a former archbishop of Cape Town, Bishop Clayton, that the private schools of his church should produce people who were unashamedly British. This was a remark made some years ago which <span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0167"/>stuck in the minds of many educationists and which had an unfortunate and adverse effect on the overall assessment of the work of private schools.</p>

<p>At the same time I should like to express my particular appreciation of the educational organization with which I happened to have discussions a few weeks ago, namely the S.A. Council for Jewish Education. This is an organization which does excellent work and it is really inspiring to see what the Jewish community is prepared to sacrifice materially to ensure a Jewish education for its children.</p>

<p>I have also referred to the question of married women, especially White married women, in education, which was emphasized by the hon. member for Durban North, and I would merely say that I trust that the reconsideration by the Committee of Heads of Education of the present policy in respect of the permanent appointment of White married women will lead to a better coordinated action in this respect. I do not think, however, that at this stage there is any surplus of White teachers, be they women or men, married or unmarried, to be made available in large numbers for the promotion of the education of other population groups. At the same time there can be no doubt that the moment some of them become available they should be put at the disposal of whatever group has a use for their services, as in fact already happens to a very large extent. I think it would not be improper to refer to the large number of farmers&#x2019; wives who are well qualified teachers who make their services available to Coloured schools in the rural areas of the Cape and who are doing a sterling job not only in terms of education, but I think also in terms of overall good group relations.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek graag verwys na die opmerkings van die agb. lid vir Standerton wat met sy gebruiklike entoesiasme as &#x2019;n ou veteraan in hierdie debat oor onderwysaangeleenthede gepraat het. Hy het die uiters belang-rike punt gestel dat professionele mense, sonder om hul professie prys te gee, tog in hul vrye tyd dienste kan lewer veral in beroepsgerigte onderwys. As dit nie die geval was dat groot getalle beroepsmense smiddae en saans deeltyds lesse gee nie, sou ons tegniese kolleges en technikons net nie kan bestaan nie. Daardie mense lewer &#x2019;n uitstekende diens en &#x2019;n voortreflike bydrae en ek kan alleen maar onderstreep wat die agb. lid vir Standerton ges&#x00EA; het, naamlik dat daar in hierdie opsig nog meer gedoen kan word om ons probleem te help verlig.</p>

<p>Ek het ook simpatie vir die agb. lid vir Standerton se probleme in die snelgroeiende Oos-Transvaal. Ek wil werklik waarsku dat ons met groot omsigtigheid, soos my agb. voorganger verlede jaar ook aangedui het, te werk moet gaan wanneer ons verdere instellings vir Blankes op die tersi&#x00EA;re vlak in die land voorsien. Ek dink dat die aanwas van die Blanke bevolking dit noodsaaklik maak dat ons in di&#x00E9; verband met groot omsigtigheid te werk moet gaan. Aan die ander kant gee bevolkingsverskuiwings soos di&#x00E9; wat in Oos-Transvaal plaasgevind het, aanleiding tot die behoefte aan die addisionele voorsiening van skole. Dit is my meegedeel dat die Transvaalse onderwysdepartement in die omgewing van Secunda in ongeveer 18 maande nie minder nie as 6 nuwe skole nie net fisiek moes bou nie, maar ook van personeel moes voorsien wat natuurlik &#x2019;n geweldige uitdaging vir die Departement stel wat reeds met &#x2019;n mannekrag-probleem te kampe het.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg South touched upon the question of first-year drop-outs and he claimed that the Black matriculation standards are not equal to what he called the White matriculation standards. This is simply not true because Black matriculants write exactly the same matriculation <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0168"/>examination that White matriculants write. The Black and Coloured departments are free to choose whichever of the so-called White department&#x2019;s examinations they wish to enter for. Where the difference lies, I think, is that, because of the lack of well-qualified teachers, which is relatively more serious in the Black schools than in the White schools, a large number of Black matriculants qualify with very little more than a pass mark. It is therefore not the matriculation standard that differs, but it is simply the level of achievement of the students that differs with that of, shall I say, the average students at a White school. I am quite sure that this is a matter which will improve in an evolutionary way as more well-qualified Black and Coloured teachers become available at the schools concerned. In the censure debate I made the point that this is a question of a natural evolution for any developing community and that it is a stage through which we of the Afrikaans-speaking community in this country also went three to four decades ago.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag aan die agb. lid vir Newton Park waardering betuig vir sy opmerkings in verband met die belangrikheid van jeugweerbaarheid en ek wil my daarby aansluit deur te beklemtoon hoe belangrik dit is dat skole die regte onderwyser vir die vak jeugweerbaarheid aanwys. Dit moet nie &#x2019;n onderwyser wees wat beskikbaar is omdat hy nou nie eintlik in &#x2019;n ander vak benodig word en derhalwe vir die vak jeugweerbaarheid afgestaan word nie. Dit moet werklik iemand wees wat voorberei, opgelei en bevoeg is om hierdie belangrike kursus op hom te neem. Ek wil byvoeg dat jeugweerbaarheid nie iets is wat net in &#x2019;n afsonderlike periode en in &#x2019;n afsonderlike vak aangebied word nie. Jeugweerbaarheid is soos taalonderwys: Dit behoort deel te wees van enige onderwyssituasie in enige vak. Net soos die rekenkundeonderwyser en geskiedenisonderwyser ook taalonderwysers is, behoort elke onderwyser in elke vak steeds die fundamentele waardes wat aan jeugweerbaarheid ten grondslag l&#x00EA;, in sy onderrig uit te dra.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Germiston-Distrik het ons getrakteer op &#x2019;n baie interessante terugblik op die geskiedenis van die skool waar onderwysers jare lank gesinne moes onderskraag wat die land op &#x2019;n belangrike vlak hier in Kaapstad kom dien het. Sy het verwys na die skoolwapen met die swaeltjies tussen die Uniegebou en Tafelberg en dit was vir my interessant. Dit het my so half gelyk na &#x2019;n boodskap van die Blou Bulle aan die Streeptruie dat een swaeltjie nog geen somer maak nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Dan wil ek ook graag verwys na die gewaardeerde bydrae van die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Oos en die baie helder beeld wat hy aangebied het daarvan dat lewensbeskoulike uitgangspunte nie net met filosofiese vakke te doen het nie, maar dat dit selfs in die mees tegniese rigting van groot belang is.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Noord&#x2014;en dit sal seker nie dikwels gebeur nie&#x2014;het werklik so reg na my hart gepraat. Ek gaan volkome met hom akkoord dat vir ons oorlewing uiteindelik&#x2014;afgesien van politieke, ekonomiese en milit&#x00EA;re sake&#x2014;die kwaliteit van ons kultuurlewe essensieel is en dat die skeppende kunste vir ons kultuurlewe van bepalende belang is. Waar hy ook &#x2019;n bietjie suur was oor die wisseling van Ministers, wil ek net graag daarop wys dat die blink gedagte van &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek na die skeppende kunste deur nie minder nie as twee van my voorgangers reeds ge&#x00EF;nisieer is sodat ek op di&#x00E9; gebied eintlik maar net &#x2019;n goeie erfenis finaal kon help deurvoer. Wat die beeldende kunste betref, het die agb. lid daarop gewys dat dit lank te kort gedoen is. Daarom wil ek net graag hier verwys na die bydrae wat die Staat gelewer het om die beeldende erfenis van die groot kunstenaar Pierneef te bewaar en te voorkom dat dit die land verlaat. In die eerste plek het die Staat &#x2019;n aantal jare gelede &#x2019;n groot bedrag be-stee&#x2014;ek dink dit was ongeveer R400 000&#x2014;om &#x2019;n aantal van Pierneef se werke wat in besit van die familie was, vir die Staat aan te koop. In die tweede plek het die Piemeeffamilie al sy tekeninge, sketse en ander materiaal wat in die familie se besit was, aan die Staatsargiewe oorgemaak en daar is &#x2019;n groot en kosbare versameling daar aanwesig. Ten slotte het die Staat aan die einde van verlede jaar &#x2019;n aansienlike bedrag&#x2014;dit was ongeveer R890 000&#x2014;bestee om die oorblywende deel van die Piemeef-versameling wat in die besit van die Bailey-gesin was, aan te koop ten einde te voorkom dat dit die land verlaat. Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n baie duidelike aanduiding van die groot belang wat die Staat <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0169"/>ook aan ons beeldende kunstenaars se werk heg.</p>

<p>Teenoor die agb. lid vir Kimberley-Noord wil ek ook &#x2019;n baie groot woord van waardering uitspreek vir sy voortreflike toespraak oor &#x2019;n aangeleentheid wat my persoonlik ook baie na aan die hart l&#x00EA;. Een van die probleme met geskiedenis-onderrig is na my mening die metodiek van geskiedenisonderrig wat dikwels &#x2019;n onderrig van antwoorde op vrae is. Geskiedenis word aangebied in die vorm van modelantwoorde op waarskynlike eksamenvrae in plaas daarvan dat dit &#x2019;n sistematiese, fundamentele bestudering is deur middel van handboeke, ens. van &#x2019;n periode van die geskiedenis met sy hele komplekse probleematiek as sodanig. Ek dink dus dat wat dit betref, ons ook maar so &#x2019;n bietjie die hand in eie boesem kan steek.</p>

<p>Wat die agb. lid vir Gezina betref, wil ek niks meer doen nie as om heelhartig met hom saam te stem oor sy waarderende woorde gerig aan die adres van die Federale Raad van Onderwysersverenigings. Soos ek aan die begin ges&#x00EA; het, het ek die grootste waardering vir hierdie mense wat soms harde onderhandelaars is, maar wat altyd lojaal en in &#x2019;n goeie gees van samewerking die hand gee met die oog op &#x2019;n gesamentlike poging in belang van die onderwys van ons jeug.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pietersburg het ons gesamentlike jeugherinneringe rondom die voortrekkerbeweging weer opgediep en sy toespraak was op sigself na my mening &#x2019;n stukkie skeppende Afrikaanse woordkuns. Ek wil hom die versekering gee dat ek baie simpatiek sal kyk na die moontlike verhoging van die finansi&#x00EB;le steun vir die Voortrekkers en dergelike jeugbewegings. Die gehalte van ons karakter as &#x2019;n volk word in groot mate bepaal deur ons jeugbewegings.</p>

<p>I should also like to express my appreciation to the hon. member for Cape Town Gardens for his very positive contribution to which I am afraid I do not have specific answers available. I shall investigate the whole question of the administrative assistance in schools, and especially the position of the school secretary, and I shall reply to him in writing afterwards. I believe that the standards applicable to the provision of administrative assistance in schools are co-ordinated through the Committee of Heads of Education. It may be that some provinces do not have the funds available, or do not assign such a high priority to this matter to make the funds available, so that there may be differences of approach in this regard between the provinces. I agree with him, however, that good administrative assistance is of the utmost importance to relieve professional people of chores inhibiting them in the job they are really supposed to do. I think that the whole question of educational management, the efficient management of educational institutions, is of very great importance and it is in this context that I shall consider his suggestions.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Rissik het na my mening in &#x2019;n rustige en gebalanseerde toespraak ons almal se oortuiging uitgespreek dat die universiteite s&#x00F3; belangrik is dat ons nie daar onverantwoordelikhede kan duld nie. Ek het groot waardering vir die wyse waarop hy gepoog het om eensgesindheid in hierdie Komitee rondom hierdie kwessie te verkry. Ek wil hom graag die versekering gee dat ek in die gees waarin hy gepraat het, hierdie saak ook verder sal hanteer.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes, net soos die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Oos, het die kwessie geopper van universiteitspersoneel se onvergenoegdheid met hul bedeling in die jongste salarisstruktuurveranderings. Ek wil weer eens die versekering gee dat, waar die Komitee van Universiteitshoofde met betrekking tot die salarisinsette as die segsmanne van die universiteitsgemeenskap optree, hulle die volle geleentheid het om regstellings voor te stel waar hulle oordeel dat die jongste aanpassings aan sekere dele van die universiteitsgemeenskap nie ten volle reg laat geskied het nie. Ek wil agb. lede daaraan herinner dat die Roux Venter-verslag aangetoon het dat die skool-sektor &#x2019;n groter agterstand in vergelyking met vergelykbare poste in die openbare sektor getoon het as wat die universiteitsektor getoon het, nie in vergelyking met die openbare sektor nie, maar in vergelyking met &#x2019;n baie gunstiger gemiddelde tussen die openbare sektor en die private sektor. Dit was dus &#x2019;n gunstiger vergelyking wat in die geval van die universiteite getref is. Desnietemin is daar tog gevind dat die agterstand in die geval van die skole gemiddeld 26&#x0025; was terwyl dit in die geval van die universiteite net <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0170"/>onder 16&#x0025; was. In der waarheid varieer die verbetering in die geval van die universiteite, soos ek reeds aangetoon het, van 18&#x0025; tot iets meer as 30&#x0025;. Ek wil egter herhaal dat die universiteite s&#x00F3; belangrik is en dat die kundigheid en intellektuele vermo&#x00EB; wat van die universiteitsdosent vereis word, sodanig is&#x2014;hulle moet per slot van sake intemasionaal kan meeding en in intemasionale wetenskaplike gesprekke kan saampraat&#x2014;dat ons nie kan bekostig om in hierdie verband onvergenoegdheid, indien op redelike gronde gebaseer, te laat voortduur nie. Ons sal dus indringend daarna kyk.</p>

<p>I am very surprised that the hon. member for Johannesburg West pointed out that he had to fight the election against a full-time member of the staff of another university. I would like to give the assurance that on this side of the House the one member I know of who used to be a university professor, namely the hon. member for Helderkruin, had to resign the moment he accepted party nomination and that from that day until the day of the election he was without income. I think that this is the proper kind of risk that should be borne in such circumstances. I think it would be highly improper if universities were to allow staff members to retain their position in the university establishments up to the date of election. I sincerely hope that, if there are inconsistencies in this respect in the conditions of service of the different universities, the universities concerned will expeditiously iron out these inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Brentwood het &#x2019;n welsprekende uiteensetting van die veeleisendheid van die onderwysberoep gegee. Hy was so welsprekend dat ek eintlik bly was dat hy nie as &#x2019;n werwer vir die onderwysberoep optree nie! Ek waardeer sy opmerkings en die wyse waarop hy van binne die beroep ons laat verstaan het onder watter spanning en verskeidenheid van druk die onderwyser in sy daaglikse le we optree.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek aan die adres van die agb. lid vir Verwoerdburg my waardering uitspreek vir sy uiteensetting en ek hom die versekering gee dat die knelpunte wat hy aangestip het, ook vorentoe aandag sal geniet, alhoewel dit nie sonder probleme gepaard sal gaan om dit s&#x00F3; uit te stryk soos hy dit graag wil sien nie omdat sowel behuisingsubsidies as motorskemas natuurlik deel is van die owerheidsdiensvoordele in die algemeen en baie moeilik net vir die onderwysberoep beding of toegeken kan word. Daarmee volstaan ek.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Oos het vanaand onder andere probeer verduidelik wat die verskil in benadering is tussen die PFP en die Nasionale Party met betrekking tot onderwysaangeleenthede. Toe het hy aangehaal om aan te dui dat ek ges&#x00EA; het dat die tegnologie nie etnies gebonde is nie. Ek het so daaroor gesit en dink, en gevoel dat ek dalk met hom moet saamstem, want Afrikaner-Nasionaliste-ingenieurs het blykbaar sekere formules wat hulle kan gebruik wat ander mense nie het nie. Hulle kan byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n komper voer met &#x2019;n klomp syfers oor Kaapstad, dan &#x2019;n streeksbeplanningsprogram invoer, &#x2019;n knoppie druk en dan die antwoord verkry dat al die Bruin mense in Kaapstad na Atlantis moet dekonsentreer! [Tussenwerpsels.] Wat ek eintlik wil illustreer, is dat tegnologie nie etnies gebonde is nie.

<p>Ja-nee, dit is maar &#x2019;n moeilike verskil, n&#x00E9;?</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag &#x2019;n lansie breek vir &#x2019;n sekere minderheidsgroep, want dit is ook tradisie dat die PFP blykbaar die enigste spreekbuis is van groepe mense wat soms in die sisteem vasgevang word. Ek verwys nou na die groep onderwysers wat oor &#x2019;n M plus 2-kwalifikasie beskik, wat vroe&#x00EB;r jare die minimum kwalifikasie vir toetrede tot die beroep was, en wat hulle nou in promosieposte bevind. Onderwysers met hierdie tweejarige kollege-opleiding, asook &#x2019;n klomp immigrante-onderwysers, wie se kwalifikasies as M plus 2 aangeslaan is, kon in prim&#x00EA;re skole onderwys gee, en ook vir promosieposte in aanmerking kom. In 1970 is toe aangekondig dat die minimum kwalifikasie vir hierdie promosieposte vanaf 1975 verhoog sou word tot &#x2019;n M plus 3-kwalifikasie. Tot en met 1975, egter, is daar <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0171"/>natuurlik &#x2019;n klomp persone met M plus 2-kwalifikasies wel in hierdie promosieposte aangestel. Di&#x00E9; persone is aangestel, neem ek aan, op meriete, en in kompetisie met persone met M plus 3-en ho&#x00EB;r kwalifikasies. Dit wil s&#x00EA;, die aanstellings is volgens meriete gedoen en nie soseer volgens kwalifikasies nie. Tot en met 1978 was die pos wat beklee is die bepalende faktor in die vasstelling van die salarisskaal, maar sedert Januarie 1978 is daar toe gedifferensieer met betrekking tot akademiese kwalifikasies, behalwe in promosieposte waar die M plus 2-kwalifikasie gelykwaardig aan die M plus 3-kwalifikasie gestel is. Die probleem het toe in April 1981 na vore gekom, toe daar &#x2019;n verskil in die promosieposte, met betrekking tot die M plus 2-en die M plus 3-kwalifikasies, aangekondig is. Selfs as &#x2019;n mens aanvaar dat, na jare van ondervinding, die gewone onderwyser met &#x2019;n M plus 2-of M plus 3-kwalifikasie aan differensiasie onderhewig is op grond van die klassituasie, wil ek tog s&#x00EA; dat bevoegdheid in die klaskamer nie soseer saak maak by &#x2019;n promosiepos as &#x2019;n hoof of onderhoof nie, maar eerder die vaardighede van bestuur.</p>

<p>Die teenstrydigheid in die salarisskale beteken nie net dat daar &#x2019;n verskil in die salarisse van persone met M plus 2-en M plus 3-kwalifikasies bestaan nie, maar in der waarheid ook dat &#x2019;n gewone onderwyser met &#x2019;n M plus 3-kwalifikasie nou meer kan verdien as &#x2019;n skoolhoof met &#x2019;n M plus 2-kwalifikasie.</p>

<p>Die persone wat so geraak word, is uit die aard van die saak persone wat reeds ses of meer jare in hul poste staan, en wat ek aanneem hul poste goed beklee, want anders sou hulle seker onthef gewees het, of ten minste in &#x2019;n laer pos aangestel geword het. Ek wil dit dus duidelik stel dat my pleidooi net gaan om daardie persone wat in promosieposte staan, en soms ook in groot skole hoofde en onderhoofde is. Ek sal dus graag wil weet of die agb. Minister nie die situasie van sodanige persone spesiaal kan oorweeg nie. Moontlik kan hy dit as beginsel oorweeg dat persone wat voor 1975 aangestel is, of persone wat, s&#x00EA;, binne tien jaar van aftreeouderdom is, teen &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r skaal aangestel kan word.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die paar minute wat ek nog tot my beskikking het, wil ek graag verwys na &#x2019;n paar ander aangeleenthede, want ons in Suid-Afrika verkeer in ongewone omstandighede in di&#x00E9; sin dat ons &#x2019;n agterstand in onderwys moet inhaal. Ek wil graag weet of daar aandag gegee word aan buitengewone onderwysmetodes om hierdie buitengewone omstandighede tegemoet te kom. So dink ek byvoorbeeld aan moontlike oplossings soos die invoer van onderwysers om tydelike tekorte aan te vul; die gebruik van die TV en die radio om onderwys aan te vul, al is dit dan nie formele onderwys nie; die voorsiening van deurlopende onderwys vir volwassenes, of heronderwys om persone te heronderrig om beter by veranderende omstandighede aan te pas; die beter gebruik van bestaande fasiliteite, want ons weet dat skole vir baie ure ledig staan; die intrek van gekwalifiseerde persone uit ander beroepe, soos vorige sprekers ook al voorgestel het, om die tekort aan voltydse onderwysers aan te vul; en laastens, die beter gebruik van onderwysers as professionele mense in hulle vakgebiede, sodat sulke dinge soos naelinspeksies, ryeloop, sport en vorms invul oorgelaat kan word aan mense soos verple&#x00EB;rs, sersante en, s&#x00EA; nou maar, oud-Springbokke en klerke.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Greytown het in die eerste twee-derdes van sy toespraak baie te s&#x00EA; gehad oor sake rakende die onderwys, maar ek wil aan hom s&#x00EA; dat ek hierdie naweek Rustenburg toe gaan, en ek gaan sy skoonma daar vertel watter onsin hy hier kwytgeraak het. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dan moet daardie agb. lid nie weer sy voete in Rustenburg sit nie! Ek is darem bly, mnr. die Voorsitter, dat die agb. lid op die ou end <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_0172"/>ges&#x00EA; het waarom sy pleidooi eintlik gaan, maar ek wil darem ook dit bys&#x00EA;: Ek hoop die agb. Minister het gevolg waarom dit gegaan het. Op die ou end het hy met die gedagte voor &#x2019;n dag gekom dat buitengewone onderwysmetodes hier te lande die nodige aandag moet kry. Toe is daar, by wyse van &#x2019;n antwoord op &#x2019;n vraag, &#x2019;n saak baie duidelik gestel. Ons sal dit seker maar in gedagte moet hou in die toekoms. Miskien sal ons later weer daaroor kan gesels.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil &#x2019;n paar punte aanroer in verband met opleiding en indiensplasing. As ek nou daaroor praat, dan dink ek tog dat die indiensplasing van die agb. lid vir Greytown nie so goed was nie, omdat die opleiding seker nie so goed was nie, en sy kiesers hom seker nie so goed geken het nie! Meneer, ons staan nog onder die indruk van die samesprekings wat in die Ander Plek gevoer is oor die wetsontwerp wat daar aangeneem is, en dit is dus seker nie onvanpas om hier &#x2019;n paar woorde te s&#x00EA; oor die opleiding en indiensplasing van leerlinge uit spesiale skole, of te wel verstandelik vertraagdes, nie. Dit was en is nog steeds, en dit sal altyd so wees, dat dit &#x2019;n saak is wat probleematies van aard is om seuns er. dogters wat verstandelik vertraag is in &#x2019;n geskikte werk te plaas. Alhoewel dit probleematies is, kan hulle tog gehelp word as hulle realistiese beroepskeuses maak, vir werk registreer en, vanselfsprekend, volhard in hulle pogings om werk te kry. Dit is belangrik om daarop te let dat die Staat, die ouer en die gemeenskap hier &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol het om te vervul. Die Staat en die onderwysowerhede moet aan die ouers van daardie leerlinge die sekerheid kan gee dat na die belange van hulle kinders in die ware sin van die woord omgesien word. In di&#x00E9; verband moet die ouers ook dan weet dat daar die nouste samewerking is tussen die Departemente van Nasionale Opvoeding en Mannekrag. Dit is goed om te weet dat dit vir die onderwyserskorps moontlik is om hierdie leerlinge reeds baie vroeg op &#x2019;n wetenskaplike wyse te identifiseer en die hele probleem om di&#x00E9; toestand te evalueer, met inagneming van alle bydraende en veroorsakende faktore wat aanleiding kan gee tot die dergelike probleme.</p>

<p>Soos noukeurige evaluering van die leerling, nadat hy met sy skool en opleiding klaar is, belangrik is om hom selektief in diens geplaas te kry, so is dit ook eweneens van belang dat di&#x00E9; leerlinge alreeds in die laerskool die gespesialiseerde aandag kry, soos wel die geval is. Sodra daardie leerlinge dan in die sekond&#x00EA;re skoolfase inbeweeg, is daar duidelike beroepsgerigtheid in die silla-busse en onderrigmetodes ingebou, wat verseker dat di&#x00E9; leerlinge vir die ope arbeidsmark reg sal wees en dat die werk wat hulle sal beklee, sal pas by hul vermo&#x00EB;ns, aanleg en belangstelling. As dit sou blyk dat so &#x2019;n leerling oor die nodige potensiaal beskik om vakleerlingskap aan te durf, dan is dit ook moontlik vir hom om dit te doen, en gaan die departement selfs so ver dat vrystelling van die Registrateur van Vakleerlinge gevra kan word van die verpligte skolastiese vereistes, alles in &#x2019;n poging om hierdie leerlinge in die beste verband van &#x2019;n sertifikaat te voorsien, wanneer hulle in die arbeidsveld te lande kom. Indien dit sou blyk dat &#x2019;n leerling sodanig gestremd is dat dit nie moontlik is om hom van &#x2019;n geskikte werk in die ope arbeidsmark te voorsien nie, is daar nog die beskutte-arbeidsituasie, waar werk dan vir hom gesoek kan word. Dit is ook goed om te weet dat die departement ook met die administrering van &#x2019;n gesubsidieerde arbeidskema na &#x2019;n sekere groep van hierdie kinders kyk, en daarmee sorg dat geeneen uitgelaat word wanneer dit kom by die plasing van die kinders wat met hierdie probleem te kampe het nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat die verantwoordelike persone, wat die kurrikulum vir hierdie leerlinge van tyd tot tyd nasien, baie seker sal maak dat daar ook in die behoefte omgesien word van die meer begaafde leerling, want net soos wat &#x2019;n mens die meer begaafde leerling in enige kategorie kry, is daar ook in hierdie groepe sekerlik meer begaafdes onder die verstandelik vertraagdes, wat dan vanselfsprekend die nodige aandag moet kry. Hoe ho&#x00EB;r die standaard van skoling en inskoolopleiding van sulke leerlinge is, vanselfsprekend, hoe beter is die kans, dat ons hulle ten volle in die mannekragsituasie sal kan benut. Dit sover dit die verantwoordelikheid van die Staat betref.</p>

<p>Tweedens, Meneer, rus daar &#x2019;n groot verantwoordelikheid op die skouers van die ouers van sulke leerlinge. Afgesien van die taak, wat seer sekerlik &#x2019;n veeleisende taak is, om hierdie leerlinge opvoeding in die normale <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0173"/>gesins-en gemeenskapsverband te gee&#x2014;wat uiteraard probleematics is&#x2014;is die versoeking tog groot, en ons kan hulle nie verkwalik nie, om sulke kinders in &#x2019;n rigting te wil laat gaan of in &#x2019;n werksituasie te plaas waarvoor hulle, soos dit later mag blyk, nie opgewasse is nie. Hier is die samewerking en die goeie verstandhouding tussen die ouer en die onderwyser van die allergrootste belang&#x2014;die onderwyser wat nie net die kind, met wie hy heeldag werk en aldag mee te doen het, ken nie, maar ook die onderwyser wat sal verstaan wat in die hart van &#x2019;n ouer van so &#x2019;n leerling omgaan. Die ouers moet verder daarop let dat hulle tog moet seker maak dat wanneer die kinders kom by die voltooiing van hierdie inskoolopleidingsproses, hulle tog die kinders sal registreer ten einde dit vir die Departement van Mannekrag maklik te maak om te verseker dat hulle op een of ander wyse in diens geplaas word.</p>

<p>In die derde plek wil ek s&#x00EA; dat daar &#x2019;n baie groot en belangrike verantwoordelikheid ook op die privaatsektor rus, nie alleen omdat di&#x00E9; mense mildelik kan bydra met betrekking tot die fondse wat deur sulke skole benodig word nie, maar ook om seker te maak dat elke beskikbare opgeleide werker &#x2019;n gelykwaardige staanplek sal kry in die arbeidsveld van more. Ons mag nie toelaat dat &#x2019;n enkele een van hulle die pad op di&#x00E9; manier byster raak nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag iets s&#x00EA; oor &#x2019;n skool daar by Rustenburg, die Oom Paul-skool. Dit is &#x2019;n inrigting wat voortreflike werk doen en op voortreflike wyse omsien na die gebied se kinders wat daar op skool is. Ek kan met groot bewondering s&#x00EA; dat daardie hoof en personeel &#x2019;n diens lewer wat van &#x2019;n baie ho&#x00EB; standaard is, maar wat ongelukkig nie altyd na reg waardeer word nie. Dit geld seker vir meer as een van hierdie spesiale skole. Hierdie onderwysers is mense wat bereid is om by hierdie inrigtings onderrig te gee, gewoonlik uit die kalklig uit, in die skadu van groter skole, wat om verstaanbare redes voor in die ry staan van akademiese en sportprestasies. Hierdie mense is dan ook gewoonlik weg van die opwinding van dit wat by die groot skole gebeur. Ek wil &#x2019;n beroep op die gemeenskap doen om by wyse van meelewing in die beperkte aktiwiteite van daardie skole, hulle belangstelling in die ware sin van die woord te toon.

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. CUNNINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, veel is reeds ges&#x00EA; oor die knelpunte in ons onderwys, en veel is dan ook gedoen om die posisie te probeer regstel en te verbeter.</p>

<p>Daar was ook al baie argumente gewees oor wat eerste gekom het, die hoender of die eier, of die eier of die hoender. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek weet net dit; die Nasionale Party het gekom voor die &#x201C;Progs!&#x201D;</p>

<p>Meneer, dan is daar natuurlik ook vandag &#x2019;n klein groepie mense wat voel dat die onderwyser die hele volk se kinders moet opvoed, en dat hy dus as sulks die prim&#x00EA;re beroep in die samelewing vervul, en daarom dan ook as sulks meer moet geniet as ander beroepe. Maar, as &#x2019;n buitestaander, stem ek saam met die oorgrote meerderheid van onderwysers, wat net bloot wil h&#x00EA; dat hulle beroep op dieselfde professionele peil en vlak gestel moet word as die ander beroepe. Uit hierdie oogpunt, dan, wil ek vanaand &#x2019;n paar opmerkings maak. Ek wil nie te kenne gee dat daardeur veel knelpunte opgelos kan word nie. Inteendeel; ek voel dat dit miskien kan bydra om die onderwysprofessie &#x2019;n bietjie meer aanvaarbaar te maak.</p>

<p>Die eerste punt wat ek wil stel, is dat salarisse so naby as moontlik aan die privaatsektor moet kom&#x2014;dit betwyfel ons nie. Maar, Meneer, kom ons kyk &#x2019;n bietjie dieper na hierdie faset. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet die suur en die soet maar saamgooi en s&#x00EA; dat as jy dieselfde salarisse op dieselfde peil wil h&#x00EA; as die buite-instansies, jy sekerlik ook maar bereid moet wees om dieselfde aantal ure in te sit. Ek weet daar gaan mense wees wat vir my sal s&#x00EA; dat die onderwysers baie ure insit. Maar, Meneer, kom ons wees wetenskaplik; laat ons kyk na die moontlikheid dat ons twee soorte of kategorie&#x00EB; onderwysers kan h&#x00EA;. Wat betref die eerste groep, kan ek nie dink waarom hulle nie byvoorbeeld van 8.45 in die oggend tot 4 namiddag kan werk nie; hulle hou skool, s&#x00EA;, van 8.45 tot een-uur, en na skool bly hulle nog steeds onder bevel van die hoof, wat vir hulle dan kan aans&#x00EA; om buitemuurse aktiwiteite te onderneem, soos die hoof dit wil h&#x00EA;. Dan kan daar ook nie &#x2019;n gemor wees van die een groepie nie wat s&#x00EA;: Ons word meermale gebruik, en die ander kan huis toe gaan.</p>

<p>Hierdie groepie sou ek graag as permanente onderwysers daar wou stel, di&#x00E9; wat werk van 8.45 in die oggend tot bv. 4 nm. <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0174"/>Nou gaan ander mense omdraai en s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Ja, maar wat van die getroude vrou?&#x201D; Meneer, ons kan vir hulle ook voorsiening maak in di&#x00E9; sin dat hulle kan werk van 8 vm. tot byvoorbeeld eenuur, en dan kan hulle saam met die kinders huis toe gaan. Ons kan hulle kategoriseer as tydelike personeel, net soos wat ons nou doen. Daar sal dus twee soorte poste wees, naamlik tydelik en permanent. Die tydelikes sal werk van 8 vm., of kwart voor agt, tot 1 nm. of soos ooreengekom. Hulle gaan huis toe, en geen verdere buitemuurse aktiwiteite word van hulle verlang nie. Dan is daar die permanente personeel wat tot vieruur namiddag gevra kan word om te werk, en wat tussen half-twee en vieruur doen wat deur die hoof aan hulle opgedra word. Ons vertrou dat daardie hoof regverdig sal werk en in aanmerking sal neem die vakke wat die mense moet bied, en dat hy die buitemuurse aktiwiteite eweredig sal verdeel en sodoende ook aan daardie mense tyd sal gee sodat hulle vir die volgende dag kan voorberei.</p>

<p>Meneer, daar gaan in elk geval ook diegene wees wat sal s&#x00EA; dat hulle me dieselfde ure werk as mense daarbuite nie, omdat hulle tuis nog twee tot drie uur voorbereiding per dag het. As &#x2019;n mens hierdie dinge egter werklik gaan analiseer, vind jy dat die aantal dae verlof wat &#x2019;n onderwyser per jaar tot sy beskikking het, weer vergoed vir daardie twee of 2 &#x00BD;uur per dag waarin hy voorbereidingswerk vir sy taak moet verrig. En, Meneer, laat ons maar doodeerlik wees; die buite-instansies, die mense in die privaatsek tor, die professionele mense, werk ook nie net tot half-vyf die middag nie. Daar is &#x2019;n hoop van hulle wat ook bykomende ure elke dag moet insit.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek wil ook verder gaan en aanvoer dat skoolhoofde en adjunk-hoofde vir een of ander vorm van voltydse of permanente vervoertoelaag in aanmerking moet kom. Inteendeel; ek wil verder gaan en &#x2019;n verdere pleidooi rig met betrekking tot die skoolhoofde van ons baie groot skole. Hier kan ons dink in terme van &#x2019;n Regeringsmotor, wat aan hulle beskikbaar gestel kan word as deel van hulle diensvoorwaardes. Di&#x00E9; mense moet partymaal ouers gaan besoek. Hulle word na ure uitgeroep. Hulle moet die skole oop-en toesluit, en dit alles moet hulle doen teen hulle eie koste. Hulle is dus besig om die Regering in daardie verband te ondersteun. Ek voel dat, net soos ons wil probeer om die onderwysers wat buitemuurse aktiwiteite het, te vergoed, ons hierdie mense ook moet vergoed op &#x2019;n permanente basis, met di&#x00E9; voorbehoud dat die heel groot skole se hoofde miskien &#x2019;n permanente toebedeling in die vorm van &#x2019;n motor kan kry.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander belangrike faset wat myns insiens tot nou toe heeltemal eenkant gestaan het, is die opleiding van ons skoolhoofde en adjunk-hoofde in die bestuurskuns. Ons het netnou gehoor dat so &#x2019;n skoolhoof in beheer kan staan van &#x2019;n gebouekompleks van R5 miljoen. Hy het &#x2019;n klomp personeellede wat hy beheer. Daar is finansies wat hy moet beheer. Hy moet die beeld van die skool &#x201E;verkoop&#x201D;. Hy is &#x2019;n bestuurder in elke sin van die woord. Nie een, of altans baie min van hulle, het al &#x2019;n goeie kursus in die wese van die bestuurskuns gevolg. Ek voel dit is noodsaaklik dat ons daardie mense die beginsels aanleer sodat hulle ook die hele skool opset uit die oogpunt van &#x2019;n deskundige bestuurder op di&#x00E9; gebied kan bestuur. Hy is &#x2019;n besigheidsman; kom ons bied hom die geleentheid om dit aan te leer.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander probleem wat nog steeds opduik, is die Saterdae wat ons arme onderwysers aan diens moet wees, sonder enige vergoeding. Daar is baie Staatsdepartemente wat hulle mense wat Saterdae aan diens moet wees, oortyd betaal. Ek weet dat dit seker &#x2019;n baie tere puntjie in die departement is, maar is dit werklik regverdig om van hierdie mense te verwag dat hulle Saterdag na Saterdag op die sportvelde moet deurbring sonder dat hulle enige vergoeding daarvoor kry? Dit is werklik iets wat ons aan di&#x00E9; mense verskuldig is. Private organisasies en ander Staatsdepartemente doen dit; waarom kan ons dit dan ook nie in die geval van die onderwysers doen nie? Meneer, ek wil onmiddellik hier byvoeg dat ek in hierdie verband vakansietoere wil uitsluit, want dit is vir die onderwyser baiemaal net so &#x2019;n heerlike, ontspannende tyd as wat dit vir die kinders is. Ek sal hom beslis nie daarvoor oortyd wil betaal nie.</p>

<p>Meneer, dan is daar &#x2019;n ander probleem wat ons reeds al aangeraak het, naamlik die administratiewe rompslomp. Meneer, ons het hier met opgeleide, verantwoordelike mense te doen, en nie met &#x2019;n klomp skoolkinders nie. Ek kan werklikwaar nie sien <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0175"/>waarom ons hierdie mense nie kan toelaat om hulle inisiatief te gebruik en om dit goed te gebruik nie. Hierdie mense kom vol moed, vol durf en daad uit ons opleidingsinrigtings, die kolleges en die universiteite uit, maar baie gou verval hulle in &#x2019;n groef, omdat hulle nie toegelaat word om daardie fut wat hulle nog het, te gebruik nie. Party mense sal s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Ja, maar die skoolhoof laat my nie toe om dit te doen nie. Hy is absoluut soos &#x2019;n rots, en hy wil niks verder weet as sy eie sienswyse nie.&#x201D; Ek herhaal, Meneer: As ons hierdie manne &#x2019;n bietjie in die bestuurskuns skool, sodat hulle kan leer hoe om mense te lei en om prioriteite daar te stel, meen ek dat ons hierdie bottelnek kan oor kom.</p>

<p>Heel laastens, Meneer, wil ek &#x2019;n baie kontensieuse saak aanroer, en dit is die verskille wat daar tussen die provinsies bestaan. &#x2019;n Kind wat vanaf die Transvaal na Kaapland kom, of van Natal na die Vrystaat toe of hoe dit ook al sy, gaan deur &#x2019;n ontsettende moeilike tyd omdat hy moet aanpas. Meneer, as ons almal dieselfde salarisse verdien, waarom kan ons nie almal onder dieselfde leerplanne werk nie? Dink net daaraan hoeveel organisasies daar huidiglik is wat matriek-en ander eksamens afneem. Dink net daaraan hoeveel handboeke daar in die verskeie provinsies is. Dieselfde vakke word aangebied, maar die handboeke verskil. Boeke moet gedruk word en eksamens moet opgestel word. As ons onder een organisasie werk, en ons werk vir een doel, soos die geval is in lande oorsee waar daar net een departement is&#x2014;ek herhaal, een departement vir Blank en een departement vir nie-Blank in ons eie opset&#x2014;dan voel ek &#x2026; [Tussenwerpsels.] &#x2026; dat ons baie daaruit sal kan put en dat ons baie van die administratiewe werk wat aan die saak verbonde is, uit die weg sal kan ruim. Ja, Meneer, daardie agb. lede het t&#x00E9; gou bly geword. Ek voel dat ons moet probeer om sover moontlik hierdie saak op &#x2019;n absolute gelyke provinsiale basis te stel. Dan sal ons ook vind dat onderwysers van die een provinsie na die ander sal kan gaan sonder dat daar enige daadwerklike probleme geskep word. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Stilfontein at the end of his speech raised what he called a contentious subject. I must confess it is very contentious to suggest that in any way possible the Transvaal and the Cape could be the same. However, I do appreciate the probleem and I am sure the hon. the Minister will respond to it. I am sorry that I misunderstood the hon. member for Stilfontein. I thought that he was going to, as it were, anticipate certain reports which may or may not contain certain recommendations regarding one department. Alas, the hon. member dashed my hopes.</p>

<p>I should like to say to the hon. the Minister that in all the time I have been in Parliament, which is only seven odd years, I have never had such good response to any debate in which I participated. I say &#x201C;good&#x201D; in terms of a responsible and refreshing reply by the hon. the Minister. I thank him for the trouble he has taken and for taking some of the matters I have raised seriously, and for responding honestly. I really appreciate that very much.</p>

<p>There is one other matter which I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give his attention. One of the problems that a number of teachers talk about when they talk about the whole question of the profession, is the lack of involvement they have in curriculum planning. Someone said today&#x2014;perhaps it was the hon. the Minister himself&#x2014;that the person who actually teaches in the final analysis is the most important person, the person who is right there with the young people day after day. Whether they are teaching history, for example, or geography or science or any other subject, when a curriculum is being revised I would have hoped that these people who are directly responsible for bringing over the knowledge and doing the teaching would have some of their experience being called upon and that the department could in some way devise a plan whereby these people could be directly involved in curriculum planning for the various subjects.</p>

<p>Earlier today I raised the probleem of what I called an endangered species, namely the English male teacher. I am glad that it evoked some response from Government members and that there was support for the appeal that I made. Lest we get this thing out of perspective, I think I should remind this Committee that the teachers, particularly teachers of Afrikaans, are also in considerable trouble in South Africa. I refer the <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0176"/>Committee to page 33 of the Venter report where there is a breakdown as to the shortages to which I referred earlier. If you look at the shortages under &#x201C;languages&#x201D; and &#x201C;literature&#x201D; you find that the shortage of teachers in Afrikaans is really quite alarming. According to these figures it seems that they are even more scarce in terms of qualifications than teachers of English as a subject, as a language. For example, 51,5&#x0025; of the teachers who teach Afrikaans do not have the minimum requirements, whereas about 40,5&#x0025; of those who teach English lack the proper qualifications. I say that because I think it is as well that where we make the point that there is a drastic shortage of English-teaching teachers of all subjects&#x2014;I have made that point and I stand by it&#x2014;we must also bear the other in mind.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. L. BORAINE</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, dit is die moeilikheid. Ek aanvaar dit.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister replied to every point I have raised so far. There is obviously a difference of opinion from an educational point of view which one respects. However, I should like to make a point or two in connection with the appeal I made for universities and technikons to be open. I want to say that the Official Opposition has no difficulty with the concept of a university in Soweto or on the Cape Flats. A university in Soweto, for example, will be almost entirely Black by the very nature of the fact that it is placed in that particular situation. We have no difficulty with that at all. We would not want to prevent that. We would not want to suggest that that was not desirable and may be desirable in many other parts of South Africa. I would not take issue with the Rector of the University of the Western Cape when he makes the point that as a result of the fact that the University of the Western Cape is there more Coloureds have had the advantage of a university education than would have been the case without that university. I have no quarrel with that at all and I would never suggest that that University should close down. I think we need these universities wherever possible in South Africa. I agree with the hon. the Minister that there will be an even greater need for more universities and technikons throughout the country in time to come. The only point we are making is that wherever it is, it should be the university itself which should make the decision as to who should be allowed to enrol in that university. We say that those universities should be open. We have no quarrel with that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Virginia and I have had many discussions under this Vote over many years. I must say I enjoy these debates and I think both of us try to keep them on a high level. The separate education systems that the hon. member appeals for cause me a probleem. If one watched the hon. the Prime Minister on television last night and if one listened to his debate last week, one would know that he makes it clear&#x2014;to me this is a different point&#x2014;that the Coloured people as a people, as a community, are not homogeneous. He mentioned last night that some were closer to the White Afrikaans-speaking people and others to the English-speaking South Africans. If that is true, would that hon. member and the Government insist for all time on a separate system? To take up the point made by a number of speakers in this debate who talked about the fundamentals of the National Party&#x2019;s policy being Christian and national&#x2014;for obvious reasons I would prefer the word &#x201C;Judeo-Christian&#x201D;, but let us stick to &#x201C;Christian and national&#x201D;&#x2014;and that on this they stand or fall, what will they do with the Christian who happens to be Coloured, who happens to be part of the national way of life in South Africa, broadly national speaking? Will that hon. Minister and the Government tell us in this Committee that for all time they will take their stand&#x2014;and on this they stand or fall&#x2014;on separate institutions for education even though there is that close bond, a bond which I believe is getting closer and which I believe actually needs to get closer for the unity and the peace which we all work for in South Africa? That seems to me a probleem which I have never been able to understand.</p>

To talk at this time in our history of duplication instead of the opening up of the technikons and universities which are there and of those that will come, I believe is a luxury which we cannot afford.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, as &#x2019;n mens nou vanmiddag en vanaand geluister het na hierdie debat, kom jy tot een gevolgtrekking en dit is dat as jy &#x2019;n bewys wil h&#x00EA; van die gebrek aan diepte by die amptelike Opposisie, moet jy na hulle luister in &#x2019;n debat waar ons praat oor die onderwys en opvoeding in ons land. Die toesprake van bv. die agb. lid vir Bloemfon-tein-Oos, die agb. lid vir Pietersburg en die agb. lid vir Kimberley-Noord het by hulle verby gegaan.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanaand oor die uitvoerende kunste praat. Ek wil dadelik daarby s&#x00EA; dat ek juis deur die Voortrekkerbeweging waarvan die agb. lid vir Pietersburg gepraat het, in my prille jeug met die uitvoerende kunste kennis gemaak het en &#x2019;n blywende liefde daarvoor ontwikkel het. Ons het in die Christiaan de Wet-Voortrekkerkommando onder leiding van o.a. die agb. Minister wat daar sit, as plekaanwysers opgetree by Volksteater in die Pretorius-saal in Pretoria. As &#x2019;n mens praat oor die kunste, kom jy tot die gevolgtrekking dat die kunste in baie opsigte die aspoestertjie van opvoeding in ons land bly. Daarom het ek groot waardering vir die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Noord wat sy toespraak aan hierdie tema gewy het. Ek wil graag saamstem met wat die agb. lid hier oor die beeldende kunste ges&#x00EA; het.</p>

<p>In April 1979 is die verslag van die Nie-mand-kommissie na die uitvoerende kunste hier in die Parlement ter Tafel gel&#x00EA;. Op my vraag aan die destydse Minister van Nasionale Opvoeding, het hy die Komitee destyds meegedeel dat die Regering hom nog nie kon uitspreek oor die aanbevelings vervat in daardie verslag nie omdat kom-mentaar eers van verskillende instansies verkry moes word. In die tweede plek het hy ges&#x00EA; dat die Sekretaris van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding destyds besig was met die opstel van &#x2019;n dokument wat as gespreksbasis sou dien vir samesprekings wat met die provinsies gevoer sou moes word met spesiale verwysing na die Adviesraad vir Uitvoerende Kunste wat deur die kommissie van ondersoek aanbeveel is. Nou wil ek graag vir die agb. Minister vra of hy hierdie Komitee kan inlig oor watter vordering oor die afgelope twee-en-&#x2019;n-half jaar gemaak is met hierdie samesprekings. Baie mense is bekommerd daaroor dat van hierdie uiters belangrike saak op die oog af nie veel tereg kom nie. Dit gaan immers oor die kulturele verryking van ons bevolking en dan veral van ons skoolgaande jeug. In die materialistiese tye waarin ons vandag leef waar ons feitlik daagliks van die lelike hoor, sien en lees, glo ek dat geen Regering die veredelende, die mooie, die verrykende, die opheffende en die beskawende wat juis in ons uitvoerende kunste opgesluit l&#x00EA;, durf verwaarloos nie. Daarmee wil ek nie beweer dat die Regering niks in verband met hierdie saak doen nie. Inteendeel, ek dink almal van ons het die hoogste waardering vir wat die Regering ten behoewe van die uitvoerende kunste doen. Lees maar net die departement se jongste jaarverslag oor die werk van die Tak: Kultuurbevordering. Daarin sal agb. lede onmiddellik sien watter pragtige werk die Staat op hierdie terrein doen, o.a. ook op geldelike gebied. Die agb. Minister het vroe&#x00EB;r vanmiddag ook daarna verwys. Hierdie Komitee word o.a. gevra om vir hierdie boekjaar goed te keur fondse vir die vier streeksrade saam ten bedrae van R6,3 miljoen teenoor die R4,4 miljoen van verlede jaar, en vir gemeenskapsteaters R400 000 teenoor R200 000 van verlede jaar. Dit is &#x2019;n verhoging van 44&#x0025;, soos die agb. Minister ook aangetoon het. Daarom s&#x00EA; ek dat die Staat wel deeglik sy plig nakom. Daarvoor verdien die agb. Minister hierdie Komitee en inderdaad ons almal se hartlike dank en waardering. In dieselfde asem moet mens egter erken dat veel meer nodig is, veral as <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0178"/>&#x2019;n mens kyk na die behoeftes van die uitvoerende kunste. Ek wil net op twee van die vernaamste behoeftes wys.</p>

<p>Eerstens is daar die opleiding-en onderrigbehoefte. Die uitvoerende kunste het nodig toneelspelers, balletdansers, operasangers, orkesmusicie, musiekonderwysers, maar ook teatertegnolo&#x00EB;, choreograwe, dekorontwerpers en verhoogbestuurders. Hierdie mense moet opgelei en onderrig word, verkieslik in die Suid-Afrikaanse kultuurmilieu en nie in die buiteland nie. Ons het op die oomblik en oor jare heen &#x2019;n geweldige tekort aan al hierdie soort kunstenaars en kundiges. Kyk &#x2019;n mens na die stand van sake wat die opleiding en onderrig van hierdie mense in Suid-Afrika betref, soos dit goed opgesom en nagevors is deur die Niemand-kommissie, word &#x2019;n mens vervul met &#x2019;n gevoel van onbehaaglikheid ten spyte van die pragtige prestasies wat ons reeds behaal het. Die volgende is maar &#x2019;n paar knelpunte wat die stigting van die Nasionale Adviesraad wat die kommissie aanbeveel het, so dringend noodsaaklik maak. Die meeste van ons universiteite het dramadepartemente, maar hul opleiding is hoofsaaklik gerig op onderwysers en nie, op die professionele toneelspeler nie. Op die informele vlak, veral op laerskoolvlak, is die musiekonderrig toegespits op &#x2019;n paar instrumente. Ons sit bv. met &#x2019;n oorvloed pianiste in die land terwyl daar &#x2019;n groot tekort is aan strykers en koperblasers, om maar net twee te noem. Dit is een van die redes waarom ons groot orkeste in Suid-Afrika beman word deur buitelandse musicie en nie deur ons eie mense nie. Laat ek nog &#x2019;n voorbeeld noem. Daar is slegs een instansie in die land, die Pretoriase Technikon, wat teatertegnolo&#x00EB; en verhoogbestuurders oplei, maar die fasiliteite en die toerusting wat hulle daarvoor het, is hopeloos ondoeltreffend. Terloops, mag ek vir die agb. Minister vra of daar aandag aan hierdie aspek gegee is by die beplanning van die nuwe kampus vir die Pretoriase Technikon? In die algemeen glo ek ook het ons nouer skakeling nodig tussen die onderwys-en onderriginstansies, die universiteit, die technikon, die provinsiale Departemente van Onderwys en ander instansies soos die SAUK met sy radio-en televisiediens, sodat ons op hierdie vlak ook &#x2019;n nasionale onderwysbeleid kan kry.</p>

<p>Die tweede groot behoefte is fisiese geriewe. Wat die groot stede betref, is daar geen probleem nie. Die uitnemendste voorbeeld wat &#x2019;n mens hier kan noem, is die manjifieke Staatsteater wat in die begin van hierdie jaar in gebruik geneem is. Dit doen &#x2019;n mens se hart baie goed om onlangs te kon lees dat sedert 23 Mei vanjaar tot &#x2019;n week gelede amper 100 000 mense aanbiedings in daardie teater bygewoon het. Dit is &#x2019;n pragtige bewys dat ons mense wel in hierdie veld belang stel. Die platteland is egter skromelik afgeskeep wat hierdie sake betref. Dit is nie die Staat se skuld nie, maar die gevolg van verskillende omstandighede. Daar is seker nie &#x2019;n dorp in Suid-Afrika wat nie &#x2019;n stadsaal het nie en daarby ook nog een of twee skool sale en &#x2019;n kerksaal, maar min van hierdie sale is toegerus om aan die basiese behoeftes van professionele uitvoerende kunstenaars te voldoen, veral as &#x2019;n mens agter die voorgordyn gaan kyk. Min dorpe, om van skole en kerke nie eens te praat nie, het die kapitaal en finansies om sulke teaters te bou of te onderhou. Dit is &#x2019;n ontsettende duur onderneming. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, vergun my om, net voordat ek by die onderwerp kom waaroor ek wil praat, &#x2019;n woord van hartlike dank teenoor die departement te spreek vir die skoolgeboue en die sportvelde wat daargestel is vir die Sonitusskool vir hardhorendes in my kiesafdeling. Die kinders wat hier onderrig word, is van daardie groepe kinders in hierdie land vir wie &#x2019;n mens se hart werklik bloei. Hierdie kinders sal sonder so &#x2019;n skool met die besondere toerusting en fasiliteite wat daar beskikbaar is en die liefde wat daar vir hulle gebied word en die onderrig wat hulle daar ontvang, eintlik nutteloos vir die samelewing wees, maar deur d&#x00ED;t wat daar vir hulle gedoen word, word hierdie kinders opgelei om hul plek in die samelewing te kan volstaan en om in &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; mate selfVersorgend te kan wees. Ek wil my hartlike dank teenoor die departement uitspreek vir hierdie skoolgeboue, hierdie fasiliteite en sportvelde en vir wat daar vir hierdie kinders gedoen word. Ek wil byvoorbaat ook baie dankie s&#x00EA; vir die geboue wat nog daar opgerig gaan word. Dit is iets besonders om daardie skool te besoek en te sien met watter toewyding onderwysers en onderwyseresse hierdie kinders onderrig. Dit was ook my voorreg&#x2014;en <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0179"/>ek moet s&#x00EA; dit was &#x2019;n buitengewone voorreg&#x2014;om hierdie kinders &#x2019;n konsert te sien hou, om te hoor hoe hulle in &#x2019;n koor kan sing, hoedat hulle indiwidueel kan sing en hoedat hulle ook kan voordra. Dit is werklik &#x2019;n belewenis om te sien wat by hierdie skool gedoen word. Ek s&#x00EA; &#x2019;n derde keer baie dankie daarvoor.</p>

<p>Die saak wat ek eintlik vanaand wil aanroer, is in &#x2019;n mate in aansluiting met die toespraak van die agb. lid vir KimberleyNoord wat oor geskiedenis gepraat het. Ek wil meer kom by die punt van gestalte-gee aan die geskiedenis. In aansluiting by die kultuurbevorderingsfunksie van die departement, met spesifieke verwysing na finansi&#x00EB;le hulp aan verklaarde kulturele inrigtings waaronder bepaalde museums genoem word, wil ek nou vir &#x2019;n wyle aandag gee aan hierdie saak. In die besonder val onder hierdie bepaalde museums &#x2019;n paar opelug-museums, soos bv. die Pioniers-opelugmuseum by Silverton en die Willem Prinslooopeluglandboumuseum daar naby Rayton. Ek het die jaarverslag volledig gelees en dit baie interessant gevind. Ek wil dan ook die departement gelukwens met hierdie jaarverslag. Die hele kwessie van opelugmuseums geniet in die laaste tyd besondere aandag. Dit is nie &#x2019;n nuwe gedagte in die museumwese nie, maar ek dink dit is in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n gedagte wat &#x2019;n nuwe ontwikkeling belewe. So bv. het die Suid-Afrikaanse Museumvereniging verlede jaar by sy jaarvergadering as tema gehad die opelugmuseumgedagte. Die Raad van Advies van die Transvaalse Provinsiale Museumdiens, waarvan ek toevallig ook lid is, en die Departement van Museumwese in die Transvaal het ook in die afgelope jaar besondere aandag aan hierdie hele gedagte van opelugmuseums gegee. Hulle het bv. reeds opgerig die Tsongakraal daar in die Noord-Transvaal. Dan is daar ook Pilgrims Rest wat in &#x2019;n groot mate tog &#x2019;n opelugmuseum is, alhoewel nie almal miskien met my sal saamstem nie. Dan wil ek ook net terloops noem dat die owerheid van Bophuthatswana die Transvaalse Museumdiens gevra het om hom behulpsaam te wees met die oprigting van &#x2019;n opelugmuseum vir Bophuthatswana waar die Tswana-kultuur bevorder sal word. Dit is nou net eenvoudig s&#x00F3; dat ons land se geskiedenis en die historiese gebeure in ons land en die baie historiese plekke in ons land vir ons &#x2019;n besondere geleentheid gee vir die oprigting van opelugmuseums. Daar is &#x2019;n besondere dringendheid ten opsigte van die oprigting van hierdie tipe opelugmuseums. In hierdie fase van die ontwikkeling van hierdie museums is ons besig om &#x2019;n nuwe museumontwikkeling aan te pak, maar ons het met twee besondere probleme te kampe. Die een probleem is dat die geleentheid besig is om verby te gaan as gevolg van die uitwissing van reste van die verlede wat vir so &#x2019;n museum ontwikkel kan word. Verwering deur natuurele-mente, verwaarlosing wat oor die dekades ingetree het en ook menslike ru&#x00EF;nering deurdat mense goedere van daardie plekke verwyder waar hierdie museums uiteindelik opgerig kan word, is van die probleme waarmee ons te kampe het. Hierdie saak het daarom vir ons &#x2019;n saak van dringendheid geword as ons kultuurhistoriese bewaring ons erns wil maak.</p>

<p>In die tweede plek het ons &#x2019;n probleem in verband met opelugmuseums se oprigting deurdat daar &#x2019;n gebrek aan fondse is. Ek moet eerlik s&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n plaaslike bestuur bv. nie so &#x2019;n onderneming kan aandurf nie. Die provinsie van Transvaal kan eintlik ook nie met sy program in hierdie opsig vorder nie. Daar is bv. &#x2019;n plek soos Schoemansdal wat besig is om tot niet te gaan. Die laaste reste van daardie plek is nog daar en as daar nie baie vinnig werk van hierdie saak gemaak word nie, sal ons uiteindelik niks h&#x00EA; wat ons kan restoureer om iets van die Voortrekkerverlede vir ons nageslag te bewaar nie.</p>

<p>Fondse is &#x2019;n baie dringende probleem in hierdie verband. Nou lyk dit vir my of daar in die begroting van hierdie departement nie baie fondse vir die museumwese voorsien word nie sodat ek eintlik voor die situasie te staan kom dat as ek vanaand moet vra of daar nie &#x2019;n wyse is waarop hierdie departement bv. die provinsie van Transvaal met sy program tegemoet kan kom nie, die agb. Minister vir my sal moet s&#x00EA; dat daar nie fondse beskikbaar is nie. Laat my net noem dat die plaaslike besture van Transvaal bv. in die jaar 1979-&#x2019;80 R299 237 aan die museumwese in die algemeen bestee het, waarvan R102 823 &#x2019;n subsidie van die Transvaalse provinsie was terwyl die provinsie vanjaar maar R191 740 vir hierdie doel kon begroot. Dit is inderdaad &#x2019;n druppel in die emmer in vergelyking met wat &#x2019;n mens graag in hierdie opsig sal wil doen.</p>

<p><span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0180"/>Die hele kwessie van opelugmuseums kry &#x2019;n belangrikheid omdat dit hier nie net oor die kultuur-historiese gaan nie. Hierdie tipe museum is inderdaad &#x2019;n besondere tipe museum wat vir die opvoedkunde geleent-hede bied. Dit het opvoedkundige waarde. &#x2019;n Verdere waarde wat dit het, is di&#x00E9; van toerisme. As &#x2019;n mens na die jaarverslae van die provinsie kyk, verbaas dit jou om te sien hoeveel duisende mense die afgelope aantal jare reeds die paar bestaande opelugmuseums besoek het. Dit is &#x2019;n toeriste-attraksie wat werklik benut kan word en wat mense, nie net van die binneland nie, maar ook van die buiteland, kan trek sodat hulle daar kan kom besigtig d&#x00ED;t wat ons op kultuurhistoriese gebied vir hulle aan te bied het.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Uiters belangrike saak wat in die jongste tyd ook besig is om te ontwikkel, is die hele kwessie van aktiwiteitsmuseums. Daar is geen museum in die land wat &#x2019;n beter geleentheid bied om &#x2019;n aktiwiteitsmuseum daar te stel as juis die opelugmuseum nie, daar waar die besoeker die geleentheid gebied word om aktief aan sekere dinge deel te neem. Daar is bv. die maak van seep, die bak van brood, die vleg van swepe ens. wat hier ten toon gestel kan word. Dit is alles dinge waaraan mense prakties kan deelneem wanneer hulle hierdie tipe museum besoek. Hierdie omskepping van &#x2019;n opelugmuseum in &#x2019;n aktiwiteitsmuseum sal nie net die toeriste-aantreklikheid nie, maar ook die opvoedkundige waarde van hierdie museums bevorder. Ek is bewus daarvan dat die Nasionale Advieskomitee vir Museums nog maar &#x2019;n baie kort bestaan het. [Tyd verstreke]</p>

<p>Ek sluit my graag aan by die verto&#x00EB; van die agb. lid vir Koedoespoort. Dit is nie alleen &#x2019;n interessante beginsel wat hy genoem het nie maar ook &#x2019;n belangrike aspek van die museums in Suid-Afrika, soos &#x2019;n mens dit maar dwarsdeur die w&#x00EA;reld kry: Dit is die opelugmuseum teenoor die statiese museum. Daar is &#x2019;n ou gesegde dat &#x2019;n prentjie &#x2019;n duisend woorde werd is. As &#x2019;n mens die aktiwiteit kan sien in verband met sekere aspekte van die geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika, en as &#x2019;n mens ook daaraan kan deelneem, dan sal &#x2019;n mens natuurlik ook baie vinniger en deegliker leer oor die geskiedenis en sekere spesifieke aspekte soos, byvoorbeeld, seepmakery, riemlooiery en al daardie interessante dinge waarvan &#x2019;n mens nie deur &#x2019;n statiese uitstalling in diepte ingelig kan word nie. Ons ondersteun hom heelhartig in hierdie verto&#x00EB; wat hy aan die Minister gerig het en as daar addisionele fondse beskikbaar gemaak kan word vir hierdie tipe uitstalling, sal ons altyd te vinde wees vir die ondersteuning wat daarvoor nodig is. Terloops kan ek net noem dat ons dit al &#x2019;n hele paar jaar lank in Pietermaritzburg doen; ons het ook aptekersware daar, &#x2019;n mens kan sien hoe pille gemaak word en medisyne in bottels geplaas word en so aan. Ons ondersteun die hele ding terde&#x00EB;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myself with the complimentary remarks made by the hon. member for Pinelands to the hon. the Minister; to say congratulations on his very first Vote here, which he has had to table and also defend to a very large extent, although I think the question of defending his Vote has been an extremely easy one and the emphasis has rather been on the explanatory aspects. In particular I would like to say to the Minister that we appreciate the comments he made regarding the question of subsidies for private schools in the Transvaal, and I am sorry the hon. member for Standerton was not here when the hon. the Minister spoke, because he would have discovered that the private schools in the Transvaal do suffer a dearth of subsidization at the moment. We certainly look forward to the tabling or the issuing of the De Lange report, the H.S.R.C. report, and I gather, if one reads between the lines or listens between the ears, that the recommendations of the De Lange report could well be fairly positive in this respect. Let me assure the hon. the Minister that there is a desperate need for subsidies to private schools by the State in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>I would also like to associate myself with the positive approach which I think certain universities have taken towards the bridging courses for members of other population groups who attend the White universities in the faculties of, for instance, engineering. It is well known that the mental acumen to appreciate engineering concepts, which comes a lot easier to the White individual as compared to, for instance, the Black individual, is different. These universities who accept non-Whites for engineering training <span class="col_339-340" refersTo="page_0181"/>have found that the Black student does not grasp the context of engineering that easily, and they have had to provide bridging courses. In particular I may mention that I am aware of the excellent work being done by the University of the Witwatersrand in attempting to integrate these individuals without a loss to the students. Although one appreciates that this bridging training is required, I do not think that is a justification for advocating separate universities. The essence of the probleem in South Africa is to be able to get substantive support from all population groups. Therefore it is essential to expose them to the academic environment in which they will become fully appreciative of the values of a particular system, without detracting from their own cultural value system. I think there is a very clear distinction that must be made here: that the individual&#x2019;s affinity for, his support for, his own cultural system need not necessarily be in conflict with the macro value system advocated by society as a whole. One thinks of the support one would like to receive from the other cultural groups in South Africa, and I refer to the Blacks who are predominant here, for, for instance, democracy and private enterprise, and all the different aspects of private fee enterprise. We would like, in fact, to see that they become supportive of that system, but we are not asking them to sacrifice their own cultural identity. I think on that side of the House there seems to be a misconception that if you are supportive of a particular value system, you have to sacrifice your cultural affiliation. I think that is quite wrong, Sir. I think it is totally wrong and we can maximize the utilization of our tertiary institutions without any fear that it is going to detract from our cultural affiliation and loyalty. In fact, there will be a process of enrichment which the hon. the Minister himself referred to earlier on. Exchange student programmes are an enriching experience. It does not detract from your own loyalty to your cultural system.</p>

<p>Even numbers do not matter, Sir. Because the institution is dedicated to objectives which have as their fundamental principle enlightenment and the production of knowledge and insight into the variables of life, which are the common factors for all culture. I think it is a need that all cultures express, but the important aspect here is that contact is not detrimental to one&#x2019;s own cultural support at tertiary level. I indicated earlier on that the standpoint of my party, and I believe it is supported to a large extent by the PFP&#x2014;the hon. member for Pinelands referred to this&#x2014;that the affiliation for your culture, is set by the time you reach Std. 8 or Std. 9 at the latest. In most instances it is set at the age of 14 or 15. That reminds me of what the hon. member for Standerton said: That one does not want to encourage contact at tertiary level, because the average age is round about 17. But I would like to point out to the hon. member for Standerton that our young national servicemen are 18 on average, and they are exposed to the horrors of warfare. Now if they can die for their culture, why can&#x2019;t they live for their culture?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. B. MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am not sure exactly what reports the hon. member is referring to. I have read a number of reports about the aculturation process in America, and there comparisons are odious. Let me say that the position in America about the aculturation of people who come from other cultures has been a very long and drawn-out process, and it has unfortunately been bedevilled by the class struggle and economic segregation as well. One has to look at all those input factors. It is not just a simple question. If I may use the term, the answer to the question is not just black or white; there are a number of input variables which affect the aculturation process in America. I think what the hon. member has in mind is the difficulty which the nonProtestant non-Whites in America have in being fully integrated in the economic and <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0182"/>social structure. But I do not think that is a question which has a direct bearing on the creation of facilities for group contact in a plural society. There are other input variables which make a considerable difference. The class structure, the economic structure and the whole lot.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to make an appeal to the hon. Minister to very seriously consider, if the De Lange report does recommend communal utilization of tertiary education, if I may use that term, that he will do everything in his power to see that that is propagated, that it is utilized in the interests of all population groups.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. M. J. VAN RENSBURG</person> (Rosettenville):</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, na die ingewikkelde lesing wat die agb. lid vir Durban-Noord gegee het, voel ek lus om &#x2019;n bietjie sportief te wees. Ek voel die Minister moet daardie saak in hande neem en &#x2019;n kultuuraksie op tou sit in sy antwoord.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanaand met u praat oor die vinnigste sport wat daar op aarde is, die gevaarlikste sport wat daar op aarde is, &#x2019;n sport wat elke betoger sal vermorsel, wat al daardie lede van een kant na &#x2019;n ander kant sal platloop, en dit is naamlik die Formule 1 Grand Prix, daardie motorwedren wat &#x2019;n internasionale motorsport in die w&#x00EA;reldkam-pioenreeks by Kyalami geword het.</p>

<p>Dit is vandag &#x2019;n intemasionale sport en dit bied ons &#x2019;n reklameveld wat gedurig deur sekere organisasies teengestaan word. Dit is een van ons motorsportwedrenne wat eenvoudig nie deur boikotters uit die weg geruim kan word nie. Maar binne die V.V. sal organisasies soos Sanroc en Sacos en anti-Suid-Afrikaanse sportorganisasies juig as Suid-Afrika die dag ge&#x00EF;soleer kan word en ondergang in die gesig moet staar; dat motorsport nie meer by Kyalami kan plaasvind nie. Dit word aan ons ges&#x00EA; dat alleen op televisie, verlede jaar, meer as 100 miljoen kykers dwarsoor die w&#x00EA;reld na Kyalami gekyk het. As dit gestaak moet word, kan dit &#x2019;n nadelige uitwerking op alle motor-en motorfietswedrenne met &#x2019;n intemasionale karakter h&#x00EA;. Dit kan selfs die einde beteken van Suid-Afrika se deelname aan motor-en motorfietswedrenne in ander lande.</p>

<p>Indien Suid-Afrika sy plek in die ry van toonaangewende lande ten opsigte van die Formule 1 Grand Prix-motorwedren wil behou, sal daar aan die plaaslike organiseerders finansi&#x00EB;le hulp verleen moet word om die renmotors, die tegnici en die renjaers goedkoper na en van Suid-Afrika te vervoer, ooreenkomstig die gebruik elders in die w&#x00EA;reld. Die hulpverlening kan enersyds geregverdig word deur die wye reklame wat die wedrenne vir Suid-Afrika bring, terwyl dit andersyds &#x2019;n magtige instrument is in die stryd teen die verbete pogings wat aangewend word om Suid-Afrika op die gebied van sport te isoleer.</p>

<p>Ten spyte van borgskappe moes die terrein op Kyalami reeds van die hand gesit word. Daar is ongunstige weersomstandig-hede wat die bywoning be&#x00EF;nvloed. Die nekslag kan kom as toeskouers in verminderde getalle kom. Die eienaars van die Kyalamirenbaan behoort toegelaat te word om die program van aktiwiteite waarvoor die terrein geskik is, uit te brei. Bewoners van omliggende dele moenie altyd beswaar maak en hofinterdikte vra nie.</p>

<p>Besef agb. lede wat die finansi&#x00EB;le implikasies vir die promotors is? Besef agb. lede dat renmotors, jaers, beamptes, tegnici en toerusting per lug na Suid-Afrika vervoer moet word, afgesien van die prysgelde wat nog betaal moet word? In sekere oorsese lande word hierdie soort sport sterk gefinansier en ek voel dat die tyd nou hier ook aangebreek het; ek is baie ernstig omdat my jongste seun gereeld daar jaag, met Hennie van der Linde, en hy het reeds verskeie bekers ver-ower.</p>

<p>Daarom voel ek, Meneer, dat die Regering, die Transvaalse Provinsiale Administrasie en die Transvaalse Raad vir die Ontwikkeling van Buite-stedelike Gebiede dringend daarna moet kyk of die aktiwiteite op Kyalami nie uitgebrei kan word nie. Moet Kyalami nie onteien word, en moet die gebruik-vergunnings nie so aangepas word, dat die <span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0183"/>eienaars die renbaan op &#x2019;n gesonde ekonomiese grondslag kan bestuur nie? In 1984 kom die ooreenkomste met betrekking tot Kyalami tot &#x2019;n einde en dan is daardie renbaan weer in die mark. Daar moet tog nie daar vir die agb. lid vir Sandton huise op die terrein gebou word nie, want dan sal hy gevaarlike kwessies daar kry.</p>

<p>Die Sportmotorklub het baie duidelik geld nodig. Die koste verbonde aan die organisa-sie van die Grand Prix het die hoogte ingeskiet van R80 000 in 1966 tot na aan R1 miljoen in 1980. Dit is &#x2019;n sport wat ons die groep motorwedrengeesdriftiges nie moet onts&#x00EA; nie. Dit is &#x2019;n organisasie wat hulle ge-stig het sonder enige winsbejag en daar moet gekyk word wat gedoen kan word om hierdie sport te red. Ek vra die agb. Minister om asseblief na die Kabinet te gaan. Hy moet vra dat die hele Kabinet, insluitende die Eerste Minister, na Kyalami moet gaan. Hulle moet gaan kyk wat daar beoefen word. Dan sal hulle, met die motors waaroor hulle beskik, met die vaardigheid waaroor hulle beskik, al daardie mense aan die oorkant platloop. Daar sal niks van hulle oorbly nie. Hulle sal wenner No. 1 word.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil ook verwys na die behoefte aan doelmatige nasionale sport-sentrums in die land. Sulke stadions het vandag &#x2019;n dringende vereiste geword omdat die bestaande fasiliteite vir nie-Blankes nie voldoende is nie, en daar is probleme met die beheer van toeskouers. Daarom het die stadsrade van Johannesburg en Pretoria reeds sekere professionele wedstryde verbied. Daar moes &#x2019;n geskikte terrein gevind word.</p>

<p>En hier wil ek vandag vir die Minister en die Kabinet baie dankie s&#x00EA; dat hulle die terrein by Rand Mines gekry het, daar naby Uncle Charley&#x2019;s. Dit is &#x2019;n plek wat ook vir die mense van Soweto gesonde ontspanning sal bied. Ek het belang daarby gehad. My 16 000 kiesers, Blankes en nie Swartes nie, het groot belang by hierdie sportstadion, want dit was in die Randse sportstadion daar in die hartjie van Rosettenville waar die bloedigste botsings plaasgevind het; waar gefrustreerde Swartes nie toegang kon kry nie nadat hulle al daardie kilometers moes loop van Soweto af; en waar hulle teen die Blankes opgetree het.</p>

<p>Dit is hierdie saak waarvoor ek vanaand die Regering wil bedank, dat hulle daardie 270 hektaar teen die goedkoop prys van R13 miljoen aangekoop het. Daardeur het die Regering bewys dat dit sy ems is om &#x2019;n gesonde verhouding tussen al die bevolkingsgroepe van ons land op te bou. Daarom wil ons vir u as Minister s&#x00EA;, baie, baie dankie. Dit is &#x2019;n langtermynbeleid, en daarom moet daar ontwikkeling en beplanning wees ten opsigte van hierdie terrein waar uiteindelik 100 000 toeskouers sal kom.</p>

<p>Ek het vanoggend in Johannesburg met die sekretaris van die Witwatersrandse Landbougenootskap gesels en hy het my toe ook weer daarop gewys dat dit &#x2019;n doeltreffende perseel van 50 hektaar sal wees, dat dit &#x2019;n wonderlike uitstalvenster vir Suid-Afrika en die w&#x00EA;reld sal wees en dat die huurooreenkoms van 99 jaar met die Johannesburgse Stadsraad in die jaar 2 011 ten einde sal loop, maar dat dit noodsaaklik is dat die skou in 1985 op die nuwe terrein moet plaasvind. Volgens sy berekening sal die kompleks nou reeds R40 miljoen kos; in 1985 sal dit R55 miljoen kos. Die staanplek vir motorvoertuie moet vermeerder word van 7 000 op die huidige skouterrein tot 25 000 op die nuwe skouterrein.</p>

<p>Die sekretaris het aan my ges&#x00EA; dat beeste reeds verlede jaar vir R1 miljoen by die skou verkoop is en dat 800 000 mense jaarliks hierdie skou bywoon. Maar die knoop l&#x00EA; by die waardasie van die huidige terrein, by Milner Park in Johannesburg, wat R34,6 miljoen is, maar Wits Universiteit kan nie meer as die helfte van daardie bedrag vind nie, naamlik R17,3 miljoen: Waar gaan hierdie verskil gevind word? Dit is die saak waarvoor ek hoop hierdie komitee van verteenwoordigers uit die verskillende beheerstrukture uiteindelik &#x2019;n oplossing sal vind.</p>

<p>Die beskikbaarstelling vir sport van die terrein wat die Regering aangeskaf het, is &#x2019;n positiewe stap wat uiteindelik die heelhartige ondersteuning ook van die privaatsektor sal kry.</p>

<p>As ek praat oor hierdie twee groot komplekse wat kom, die een in die suide en die ander in die noorde, dan wil ek vir u s&#x00EA; dat dit grootse komplekse vir Suid-Afrika sal wees. Dit sal van baie groot belang wees, en ek hoop die Minister en die Kabinet gaan die geld vind. Iets moet gedoen word, anders moet dit uit die privaatsektor kom, maar u moet in elke geval hierdie saak aanhelp, vir die Swartes en vir die Blankes, <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0184"/>sodat hulle kan ry en speel en so goed kan ry en speel dat hulle uiteindelik al Suid-Afrika se vyande sal vernietig.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. T. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, gesien die tyd van die aand sal die agb. lid vir Rosettenville my miskien verskoon as ek nie reageer op sy interessante en soms luimige toespraak nie.</p>

<p>Van die grootste uitdagings waarvoor Suid-Afrika in die toekoms te staan sal kom, is ongetwyfeld die land se voorsiening in sy behoeftes aan wetenskaplikes en tegnici. Ek maak hierdie bewering aangesien die toekomstige ontwikkeling van die land direk verband hou met die beskikbaarheid van mannekrag in die wetenskap en in die tegnologie. Hierdie beskouing is natuurlik niks nuuts nie, en dit is ook nie oorspronklik nie. Tewens, dit is gemene saak. Maar dit ten spyte is daar vele wat die neiging het om di&#x00E9; netelige probleem te probeer vermy of om die ems daarvan te misken. Beide hierdie uitgangspunte is natuurlik heeltemal verkeerd en ek wil beklemtoon dat &#x2019;n baie ho&#x00EB; prioriteit verleen moet word aan konstruktiewe benaderings waardeur die gehalte van wetenskaplike en tegnologiese opleiding verbeter sal word en wat ook di&#x00E9; opleiding wyer beskikbaar sal stel aan al die bevolkingsgroepe van ons land.</p>

<p>Grondliggend aan di&#x00E9; probleem natuurlik is die tekort aan behoorlik gekwalifiseerde wetenskap-en wiskunde-onderwysers. Hierdie onderwysers moet nie net die kennis oor-dra nie, maar hulle moet ook hulle leerlinge motiveer om wetenskap en tegnologie verder op tersi&#x00EA;re vlak op te neem. Die kritieke rol van die wetenskaponderwyser is nie net beperk tot die suiwer wetenskappe nie. Ons kan die mediese dienste as voorbeeld noem. Elke dokter of apteker in die land moet &#x2019;n graad of diploma volg waarin natuurweten-skaplike vakke voorvereistes is. Sonder &#x2019;n voldoende wetenskapagtergrond in die ho&#x00EB;rskool, kan daar geen toegang tot hierdie belangrike beroepe verkry word nie. Soortgelyke oorwegings geld ook wat betref verskeie vertakkings van die ingenieurswese, wat ook &#x2019;n belangrike rol speel in die daarstelling van &#x2019;n infrastruktuur vir &#x2019;n ontwikkelende ekonomie.</p>

<p>Ek beweer dat ons wel &#x2019;n opsie het, maar dit is &#x2019;n opsie wat nou uitgeoefen moet word. ὸf ons stel die beste moontlike opvoeding beskikbaar aan die grootste moontlike aantal mense en waarborg sodoende ekonomiese voorspoed, ὸf ons skiet in hierdie opsig tekort en loop die risiko van ekonomiese stagnasie. Die vraag ontstaan eintlik net, watter prosedure ons moet volg om hierdie alternatief effektief te implementeer. Dit is my oortuiging dat &#x2019;n wesenlike bydrae vir die oplossing van hierdie probleem daarin l&#x00EA; dat gevorderde tegnologie aangewend moet word om die arbeidsintensiewe aard van die onderwyspro-fessie te verander, d.w.s. sodat instruksie en onderrig nie uitsluitlik van die persoonlike interaksie met &#x2019;n onderwyser afhanklik sal wees nie. Ek verwys hier natuurlik na die gebruik van rekenaars op alle vlakke van die formele-onderrigproses en in besonder die onderrig van wetenskap, wiskunde en dissi-plines van &#x2019;n tegnologiese aard. Hierdie stelling is nie gebaseer op wensdenkery nie, maar spruit inteendeel daaruit dat ek die geleentheid gehad het om persoonlik te sien hoe moderne rekenaars met welslae in-gespan kan word om o&#x00EB;nskynlik onoor-koomlike opvoedkundige probleme op te los.</p>

<p>In Suid-Afrika het een van ons universittegnologie eite die bul by die horings gepak, naamlik die Universiteit van Wes-Kaapland, en onlangs so &#x2019;n gevorderde rekenaarondersteunde onderrigsisteem ingestel ter aanvulling van hulle onderrigstrategie. Volgens prof. Sinclair, die hoof van die onderrigsen-trum by die U.W.K., ontvang studente reeds via die rekenaar onderrig in 15 verskillende vakrigtings wat strek van biochemie tot Hebreeus. Volgens hom stem verskillende dosente saam in hulle voorlopige bevinding dat di&#x00E9; studente veel gouer &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r vlak van kennis bereik. Dit is natuurlik &#x2019;n baie belangrike bevinding, gesien die agterstand in kennis wat baie studente het wanneer hulle hulle vir universiteitstudie inskryf. Verder verstaan ek dat in &#x2019;n onlangse opname van studentemenings oor hierdie rekenaaronder-steunde onderrig, gevind is dat die studente baie positief ingestel is, om verskeie redes, onder andere die feit dat die student sy eie vorderingstempo kan beheer. Die student is ook bewus van die mate waarin hy vorder omdat daar &#x2019;n evalueringskomponent in die lesmateriaal ingebou is, en die student leer in toestande van optimale privaatheid; hy weet hy is op sy eie en verlos van die inhibetegrende <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0185"/>faktor wat intree as hy in &#x2019;n groep moet respondeer. U.W.K. beoog om rekenaarondersteunde onderrig te gebruik vir die oorbrugging van die skooluniversiteitsgaping, en soos ons almal weet, kan dit op die oomblik nie gedoen word met die konvensionele middele tot ons beskikking nie. Indien daar &#x2019;n effektiewe oorbruggingskursus bewerkstellig kan word, sal dit natuurlik &#x2019;n geweldige deurbraak wees. Hulle is ook aan die werk aan &#x2019;n uitbreidings-program na die skole, en dit sal onder andere indiensopleiding van die onderwysers insluit.</p>

<p>Die rede waarom ek na U.W.K. verwys, is dat daar dus reeds &#x2019;n Suid-Afrikaanse universiteit is waar die nodige infrastruktuur geskep is en die verdere implementering van hierdie onderrig sal natuurlik baie daardeur vergemaklik word. Oorsee, en veral in die V.S.A., is baie goeie resultate behaal deur gebruikmaking van rekenaarondersteunde onderrig op skole, in universiteite en in die opleidingsprogramme van privaatinstansies. Dit word daar ook met sukses ingespan om die funksionele ongeletterde op te lei en om onderrig van gehalte beskikbaar te stel in slumgebiede, om sodoende die minderbevoorregtes die geleentheid tot vooruitgang te bied, &#x2019;n Spesiale program, die sogenaamde &#x201E;basic skills&#x201D;, is spesifiek ontwerp om studente met &#x2019;n wye verskeidenheid van aanleg, doelstellings en probleme aan te help tot ons standerd 6-vlak van bedrewendheid in lees, taalgebruik en wiskunde. Die deelnemende studente het gestrek van jong volwassenes tot mense in hulle vyftigerjare wat om die een of ander rede nie hul skoolopleiding kon voltooi nie. Gemiddeld kon wiskundeonderrig gelyk aan &#x2019;n jaar se werk binne 30 uur suksesvol afgehandel word, en soortge-lyke resultate is ook met ander vakke verkry. In die V.S.A. is die program gemik op skoolverlaters wat as gevolg van hul funksionele ongeletterdheid nie lonende werk kan kry nie.</p>

<p>Indien daar nou ges&#x00EA; word dat die V.S.A. &#x2019;n baie meer gesofistikeerde samelewing is, en nie met plaaslike toestande vergelykbaar is nie, net die volgende: In 1975 het die Amerikaanse Departement van Onderwys offisi&#x00EB;le data beskikbaar gestel wat aangetoon het dat meer as 50 miljoen Amerikaners nie die wiskundige vaardigheid gehad het om hul kleingeld by daaglikse inkope korrek te bereken nie. Wat die tegnologiese opleiding in die privaatsektor betref, het United Airlines, met 5 500 loodse, &#x2019;n rekenaar-ondersteunde onderrigprogram gebruik om hul nuwe loodse op te lei. Hulle het dit reg-gekry in &#x2019;n veel korter tydperk as wat die konvensionele opleidingsmetodes geduur het en daarmee het hulle &#x2019;n aansienlike kostebesparing teweeggebring. Rekenaarondersteunde onderrig is dus nie &#x2019;n duur foefie nie; dit is &#x2019;n beproefde en bewese hulpmiddel by ander onderrigmetodes. Met behulp hiervan kan ho&#x00EB; gehalte onderrig op &#x2019;n persoonlike grondslag 24 uur per dag aangebied word indien dit nodig is. Die doel met rekenaarondersteunde onderrig is nie om die onderwyser met &#x2019;n masjien te vervang nie, maar om hom te verlos van die sleurwerk en hom sodoende meer effektief te laat funksioneer. Die koste verbonde aan rekenaar-ondersteunde onderrig word dikwels ook gebruik as &#x2019;n argument teen die aanwending daarvan. Dit is wel duur, maar daar moet nie uit die oog verloor word dat tradisionele onderrigmetodes net so duur of duurder is nie. Die gebruik van rekenaartegnologie in die onderrig kan in werklikheid tot &#x2019;n beduidende besparing lei. Verder moet ons in gedagte hou dat die koste van die verkryging van tegnologiese hulpmiddele steeds afneem, terwyl konvensionele onderrigmetodes al duurder word.</p>

<p>Ek sluit af: Ho&#x00EB;gehalte-onderrig vir die massa in die wetenskap en die tegnologie is dringend nodig. Konvensionele opleidingsmetodes is nie by magte om dit te verskaf nie. Gevorderde tegnologie in die vorm van rekenaarondersteunde onderrig stel die opvoedkunde in staat om meer doeltreffend in ons behoeftes te voorsien. Ek beskou dit as &#x2019;n saak van dringende belang dat hierdie onderrigtegniek so wyd moontlik aangewend word en ek vra graag die agb. Minister dat daar indringend na hierdie aangeleentheid gekyk moet word.</p>

<speech by="#hoon">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HOON</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, aan die einde van hierdie debat, wat meestal gegaan het oor nasionale opvoeding as sodanig, wil ek my wend tot &#x2019;n afdeling van hierdie Departement wat ek as &#x2019;n baie belangrike deel van die Departement beskou. Ek verwys na die Tak Sportbevordering van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding. Die hoofdoel van die Tak Sportbevordering van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding is om liggaamlike opvoeding, d.w.s. sport en ontspanning, as aktiwiteite onder alle bevolkingsgroepe in Suid-Afrika aan te moedig. In die tyd waarin ons lewe, is harde fisieke werk vervang deur meganisering, en liggaamlike aktiwiteite op die arbeidsakker word beperk tot die hantering van &#x2019;n pen, die programmering van &#x2019;n rekenaar of die druk van &#x2019;n knoppie. In tye soos hierdie word die taak van die Tak Sportbevordering daagliks groter en belangriker. Omdat ons erkenning verleen aan die waarheid dat slegs &#x2019;n gesonde liggaam &#x2019;n gesonde gees kan huisves, is dit noodsaaklik dat ons in hierdie debat erkenning verleen aan die pragtige werk wat deur die Tak Sportbevordering gedoen word deur dit spesifiek uit te Hg. Ek dink die Tak Sportbevordering slaag pragtig daarin om die ongeveer 1 243 sportHggame en sportorganisasies aan te spoor tot wyer belangstelling in, en meer intensiewe deelname aan, sport en ontspanning in Suid-Afrika, om daardeur &#x2019;n gesonde en lewenskragtige volk te help verseker.</p>

<p>Ons moet vandag ons waardering betuig vir fondse wat deur die Tak Sportbevordering aan alle sportliggame beskikbaar gestel word om sekere projekte uit te voer. Eerstens word fondse beskikbaar gestel vir die organisering van verskeie oorsese sporttoere wat dit vir ons sportsterre moontlik gemaak het om intemasionaal teen die beste sportlui ter w&#x00EA;reld te staan te kom. Hierdie deelname is deur die bystand van die Tak Sportbevordering moontiik gemaak. Tweedens word dit gebruik om deelnemers van w&#x00EA;reld-formaat na Suid-Afrika te bring om hier teen die sportmanne en -vroue van Suid-Afrika te kan deelneem. Dit word ook moontlik gemaak deur hierdie afdeling van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding. Die feit dat fondse deur hierdie departement beskikbaar gestel word om mededinging op internasionale vlak, oorsee en in Suid-Afrika, moontlik te maak, is na my mening &#x2019;n lofwaardige poging deur die departement.</p>

<p>Dit is die soort ding wat veroorsaak dat daar deur betogers teen ons Springbokke opgetree word soos daar nou in Nieu-Seeland teen hulle opgetree word. Ek is dankbaar dat die Springbokke kon gaan toer het. Ons is dankbaar dat hulle in Nieu-Seeland kon gaan rugby speel, nie-teenstaande die mense wat dieselfde ideale koester as di&#x00E9; van daardie agb. lid. Ons is ook dankbaar dat die Springbokke hulle in Nieu-Seeland skitterend van hul taak kon kwyt. Ek het net gevoel dat ek hierdie saak moes noem.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander belangrike taak van die Tak Sportbevordering is dat hy met betrokke departemente, ander plaaslike owerhede, plaaslike besture en onderne-mings moet skakel en saamwerk om fasiliteite vir deelname aan sport en ontspanning aan alle volke in Suid-Afrika beskikbaar te stel en dit te verbeter. Ons het gister die voorbeeld gehad wat die agb. lid vir Rosetten-ville hier aan ons genoem het toe hy daarop gewys het hoe daar met die hulp van hierdie Departement grond aangekoop is om &#x2019;n groot sportkompleks in die buitewyke van Johannesburg op te rig.</p>

<p>In die jaarverslag sien ons dat daar ook hulp verleen word vir sportnavorsing aan verskeie Suid-Afrikaanse universiteite, en &#x2019;n mens is dankbaar om te sien watter geweldige vordering oor die afgelope paar jaar op hierdie terrein gemaak is.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander belangrike taak wat deur die Tak Sportbevordering van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding verrig word, is hulpverlening in die vorm van die afrigting van deelnemers, asook die opleiding van sport-beamptes, sportadministrateurs, afrigters en skeidsregters. Gemotiveerde, entoesiastiese en goed opgeleide sportadministrateurs, afrigters en skeidsregters is &#x2019;n absolute nood-saaklikheid in ons strewe om Suid-Afrika nie &#x2019;n nasie van sportmal toeskouers te maak nie, maar wel &#x2019;n nasie van aktiewe deelnemers.</p>

<p>Vandag wil ek graag in hierdie debat hulde bring aan die klein vakkundige personeel van hierdie departement. Ek verwys na die gekwalifiseerde liggaamlike opvoeders wat die streekkantore vir die departement beman en wat help om hierdie groot ideaal te verwesenlik. &#x2019;n Ander groot taak wat hulle met onderskeiding verrig, was die organisering, van die Suid-Afrikaanse Spele wat vanjaar deel uitgemaak het van die Republiek feesverrigtinge, iets wat na my mening &#x2019;n baie groot sukses was, en waarin 95 sportsoorte saamgesnoer is en waaraan ongeveer 5 000 mense deelgeneem het. Ek dink daardie organiseerders kan daarmee gelukgewens word.</p>

<p>Ons lees dat die onafhanklikheidsfeeste van buurstate soos die Transkei, Bophuthatswana en Venda ook gepaard gegaan het met groot sportfeeste en dat hierdie tak van die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding &#x2019;n baie aktiewe rol gespeel het om die sportfeeste moontlik te maak.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit met &#x2019;n versoek aan die agb. Minister. Met inagneming van die idee van &#x2019;n konstellasie van Suider-Afrikaanse State, en aangesien die volgende nasionale spele moontlik deur hierdie tak van sy departement ge&#x00EF;nisieer en georganiseer gaan word, kan ons nie miskien daaraan dink om volgende keer &#x2019;n Suider-Afrikaanse Spele te hou nie?

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to claim the privilege of the second half-hour.</p>

<p>I should like to commence by commenting on the 1980 report of the department which has been placed before us. I should also like <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0188"/>to speak about some of the activities mentioned in the report. This is, of course, the first time that activities relating to sport are contained in a report of the Department of National Education, but then 1980 was the first year that sport fell directly under the hon. Minister of National Education himself. Notwithstanding the new status of the department, I should like to compliment the Sport Advancement Branch&#x2014;for that is what it is now called&#x2014;on its excellent work in the furtherance of sport and the promotion of the physical fitness of all South Africans, and I should particularly like to thank the senior officials of the department. Part IV of the report, starting on page 100, deals with the Sport Advancement Branch. It is well and succinctly drafted. It avoids matters of controversy and covers the diverse activities of the department very well. The report provides ample evidence of the wide scope of activities of the department, ranging from sports awards, the Trimsa Campaign, coaching and training courses, lectures and research, right down to financial assistance and co-ordinating expertise which this department provides for the various types of sport involved. I should like to tell the officials and the hon. Minister that the Sport Advancement Branch does a happy job and that it does it well. I therefore think that they deserve our congratulations.</p>

<p>I should also like to thank the hon. the Minister for his invitation&#x2014;I have had this honour in the past&#x2014;to attend the State President&#x2019;s Sports Award Ceremony, the last of which was held only a few days ago. It has been a pleasure to attend on these occasions. I also want to say that these annual awards are greatly appreciated and that they mean a great deal to the sportsmen and sports administrators who earn them. They are, after all, people who have worked hard for many years and have finally achieved some sort of official recognition.</p>

<p>I should like to give one word of advice to the hon. the Minister, however, and that is that I think that a lot more could be done to upgrade the sports award ceremonies or functions and to increase the prestige of the awards, if only a little more attention would be paid to the media when the awards are presented, for example getting the media to understand the importance of the awards themselves. It seems to me that very often the media are not even aware of the fact that the awards are presented at regular intervals.</p>

<p>I should also like to comment on two further matters raised in the report. The first of these matters is the Trimsa Campaign. I think that this campaign is an excellent idea, having been of great benefit to many South Africans, of all walks of life, over the past two years. Every new Trim Park that is built and is opened adds a new dimension to people&#x2019;s lives. We must understand that Trim Parks are largely created by municipalities, often with the assistance of the department, and are therefore locality-orientated, i.e. they are orientated towards the municipal areas in which they are situated. Because of this a large number of Trim Parks&#x2014;if not all of them&#x2014;are in fact racially exclusive in those municipal areas. They are, in other words, segregated. This means, in effect, that nearly all Trim Parks are for Whites, with very few being available for the other races. I think it works out that way, which is a great pity when one considers the huge urban populations amongst those who are not White, and when one also considers that people who are not White need physical exercise and good health just as much as any one else does. I have two questions I should like to put to the hon. the Minister about Trim Parks. Firstly, does the department still subsidize the building of segregated Trim Parks? If it does, would he consider confining departmental assistance to those which are open to all? Secondly, the hon. the Minister announced some weeks ago&#x2014;it might have been a bit longer&#x2014;that he intended to be party to amending the Group Areas Act so that certain aspects of sport could be excluded from the ambit of that legislation. With that in mind, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether the amendments, which have not yet appeared on the Order Paper, will free municipal-and locality-orientated Trim Parks from the race restrictions by which they are still bound. In other words, will the amendments, which the hon. the Minister is going to introduce, free the Municipalities from the restrictions they labour under at present?</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Let us just have the answer first.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Let us have the hon. the Minister answer, then I can be allowed to make the second point relating to the report. Very early on in the report&#x2014;in fact in paragraph 4.1&#x2014;it is stated that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A lack of adequate sports facilities remains one of the main problems.</block>

<p>Seldom has a truer word been said. There are poor sports and there are poor communities, but we know that this backlog of facilities and equipment largely relates to the Black areas and the Coloured areas, both urban and rural. In our most sincere voices&#x2014;as the hon. member for Kuruman said so a little earlier&#x2014;we tell the world that we believe in merit selection, but I want to ask the hon. Minister what merit selection means to a young man who has never been able to play on a proper cricket field, who has never had a proper cricket bat or tennis racket, who has never had the benefit of coaching and who has generally been unable to have access to the facilities in order to achieve excellence? Of what benefit is the term &#x201C;merit selection&#x201D; to anybody who has never had such benefits or the means to achieve expertise or excellence? [Interjections.] Let me therefore make an appeal to the hon. the Minister, because there is, in fact, a tremendous lack of facilities. I believe that what is needed is a crash programme to assist underprivileged communities, and I think it should be spearheaded by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department. I think such a programme should assist those communities to acquire such facilities, equipment and expertise. If one looks at the report of the National and Olympic Games Committee, and the annual reports for various other types of sport, one finds that South Africa spends far less per capita on sport than do most other Western countries. South Africa is, in fact, way down the list. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister two questions in this connection. Will the hon. the Minister give this Committee the assurance that he will make a plea, in the Cabinet, for a better financial deal for sport as a whole? Secondly, does the hon. the Minister acknowledge the probleem of a lack of facilities in Black and Coloured areas, and is he prepared to have a look at a programme to make good those shortages?</p>

<p>There are many precedents of programmes in other countries which have been successful in the past, which can be studied and whose example can be followed. I have seen several of these programmes in countries abroad, and if the hon. the Minister needs help, I am quite certain that every major sports administration in the country would be prepared to help him, and if he is prepared to look at a crash programme to uplift unprivileged communities to make merit selection something that is meaningful, he will also have my help and that of my Party in doing so.</p>

<p>I would like to quote the comment of an Australian writer following the Springbok tour of New Zealand, as reported in a South African newspaper a week or two ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whatever your opinion of the South African Rugby Union tour of New Zealand, it would be a faint-hearted person who would refuse to give at least grudging admiration to the Springboks for the manner in which they are bearing up.<br/>The tour is an unwelcomed national trauma for most New Zealanders but on a more intense and personal level, it has been a nightmare for the 30 players and 4 officials of the South African team.<br/>There is no doubt that before they left South Africa they were warned to expect opposition and hostility.<br/>But it is equally clear that they have been surprised by the venom and violence their presence has stirred.<br/>For the most part they have adjusted to their abnormal circumstances &#x2026;<br/><span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0190"/>There have been times&#x2014;the game cancellation at Hamilton, being forced to sleep on mattresses on the floor of a rugby club on the eve of the first Test in Christchurch&#x2014;when they could have cried out in anger and frustration.<br/>But they accepted these humiliations in silence, diplomatically biting their tongues although privately they were embittered.<br/>There have been other times&#x2014;such as waiting 5&#x00BD; hours in the cold inhospitable dressing rooms at Lancaster Park before the first Test&#x2014;when they must have begun to wonder what further odds would be stacked against them.<br/>Again, they accepted their fate without complaint, albeit this time with a grim shrug so that the former All Blacks skipper and their liaison officer, Bob Stewart, felt constrained to remark on their behalf: &#x201C;Never have rugby players had to go into a Test under such intolerable circumstances.&#x201D;<br/>This is not asking anyone to feel sorry for them because it is, after all, the repugnance most New Zealanders feel towards the apartheid system they represent which is responsible for the fact that they have to play behind barbed wire barricades protected by half the police in New Zealand.<br/>But whatever you feel about the tour there can be no denying that South Africans can be proud of the conduct of these young men, of whom they are asking so much.&#x201D;</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>I am making a speech, and if that hon. member cannot be civil, I suggest he get out of this Committee. [Interjections.] It is high praise from someone who is basically hostile to our country, and I want to tell members that the Springboks deserve that praise. We have never doubted their bravery, their fortitude, their guts. They have proved it over and over again in the last few weeks in which they have been away from our country, and particularly last Saturday, a day on which&#x2014;I think against all odds&#x2014;they triumphed, a day we are all going to remember and be proud of.</p>

<p>What, however, have been the odds they have been fighting against? What has been the cost to those people and to this country? Generally, what have the odds been that our rugby players over there have had to contend with? They have had to contend with the disruption of matches and of traffic, and they have had to contend with virtually whole towns literally being brought to a standstill. They have had to worry about demonstrations and about riots which have focused further hate, animosity and hostility upon South Africa. People and their houses have been shot at, and a pilot of an aeroplane threatened to crash into a full stadium. The Springboks have been vilified in their buses and they have been disturbed in their sleep. They have been confined to their hotels and closely guarded reception areas. They have also been snubbed by mayors and functionaries. They are forced to move through New Zealand like an armed convoy in enemy territory, always in danger and requiring a veritable army of police to protect them, at a cost of millions and in the full view of world hostility.</p>

<p>The question I consequently want to ask is this: What is this Government doing to help the Springboks, in fact to help all our sportsmen in their quest to regain entry into international sport? Let me quote what Chick Henderson said in <i>The Sunday Times</i> a few weeks ago&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The report came through that a brigadier in the S.A. Police had allegedly said words to the effect of, &#x201C;Give me 20 S.A. Police and I would have sorted it out.&#x201D;</block>

<p>He obviously meant with dogs, etc., as was remarked. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These connotations made a stupid, inane remark into a sinister insinuation and South Africa&#x2019;s image was dragged down once again through the actions of a South African who tragically probably thinks that he was being clever or perhaps he just did not think.</block>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0191"/>The other news that were headlines was when the shelters of squatters in the Cape were being demolished in the presence of police and police dogs which incidentally are never used in New Zealand.</block>

<p>Mr. Henderson went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However patriotic one is, how can anyone defend the indefensible in New Zealand, a country where human rights are paramount? Such an action would make one lose ones own credibility. This story did much to destroy all the good work done by those of us who have had exposure on radio &#x2026;</block>

<p>The article goes further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It also gave new ammunition to the demonstrators who were able to say: &#x201C;This is happening now, today.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Is Chick Henderson a Prog?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>No, let me assure that hon. member that Chick Henderson is not a Prog. I have tried to make him one, but without success. Mr. Henderson goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us salute our Springboks&#x2014;they have endured so much for rugby and South Africa and they will come back with memories, some very happy, but some that will provide much food for thought.<br/>The good news they heard was the promise made by the Prime Minister that the laws restricting sporting contact would be changed, including the Liquor Act.<br/>The sportsmen have done so much for the politicians and the image of South Africa. Now the politicians can reciprocate by giving utmost priority to this legislation and changing these laws now while the Boks are still in New Zealand &#x2026;</block>

<p>I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This will at least give our supporters some real ammunition by putting promises into acts of meaningful change.<br/>For so long there have been promises, plus changes of interpretation and policy, but our opponents always say that no law on the statute book has been changed. Time is running out and the message that comes back from New Zealand is that we must support the stand our friends have taken with such determination by having the courage to change the law now as we have promised to do.<br/>We owe it to our friends world-wide. We owe it to our Springboks and we owe it to our credibility &#x2026;</block>

<p>Let me mention a few other incidents that have not helped our Springboks. There is the question of the 15 schools that boycotted the Craven week. The hon. the Minister of State Administration and of Statistics took his hat off to those schools whilst the Government remained silent. That was big news abroad. Then there is also the publicity given to the refusal of passports to sportsmen who oppose the Government. That gives rise to constant publicity abroad and does our sportsmen no good. A most recently publicized event happened only this month, and I quote from <i>The Argus</i> of 4 August 1981&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Gavin van Eyck, Coloured captain of the non-racial Eastern Cape Rugby Union, Kwaru, who was charged yesterday for being in a Black Port Elizabeth township illegally, said today he would refuse to pay a R30 admission of guilt fine.<br/>Mr. van Eyck, a union selector, was on his way to watch a match between two Kwaru sides in New Brighton on Sunday when he was stopped at a police roadblock and told that he &#x201C;did not belong here&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The article goes on to state that he was told that he was going to be charged because he was in the wrong township without a permit. We all know that two years ago the hon. Punt Janson and the present hon. Minister of Co-operation and Development announced that one did not need permits to attend sports matches. Yet the answer I received to a question yesterday&#x2014;and I have the answer lying here in front of me&#x2014;confirms that Mr. Van Eyck, who was going to attend a sports match and who is himself a selector, is about to be charged. That was world news in New Zealand. The politicians who are such ardent patriots, such super <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0192"/>patriots, should take a long look at themselves in the mirror and ask themselves if they are playing their part in the interests of our country.</p>

<p>In October last year the Human Sciences Research Council brought out a report on the normalization of sport. I should like to quote only a few points from that report. To start with let me quote paragraph 1.4 of the memorandum on the report of the Human Sciences Research Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Discriminationary measures, such as discriminatory legislation for example, are regarded as unacceptable in principle in the field of sport. The principle of sports autonomy must be maintained and promoted.</block>

<p>Can the hon. the Minister tell me how one squares sports autonomy with the Van Eyck criminal prosecution? Let me tell the hon. the Minister that one cannot, and neither can the world. When people like the hon. member for Kuruman call people like myself to account, they must think of the hypocrisy of Government policy. Let them consider that before they call people to account who merely stand up and speak the truth.</p>

<p>Paragraph 1.12 of the memorandum of the report of the Human Sciences Research Council states further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the support of sport by the authorities, interference with the autonomy of sport should be guarded against.</block>

<p>How does one square those statements by the Human Sciences Research Council with the denial of major soccer fields to non racial soccer? How, too, does one square those statements with the use of a passport as a political weapon against those sportsmen who refuse to co-operate with the Government?</p>

<p>Let me quote paragraph 1.13 from the memorandum of the report of the Human Sciences Research Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Legislation that does not by nature relate to sports situations, i.e. the Group Areas Act, should not, for example, be made applicable to sport by proclamation.</block>

<p>How does that square with Proclamation 228 of 1973 which was issued to stop the Aurora Cricket Club in Natal from admitting nonWhites into its teams? This law is still on the Statute Book and is still hanging like an axe over the heads of local sportsmen. The Human Sciences Research Council says that the provisions of Proclamation 228 affect participation in sport <i>prima facie</i> directly and are of a discriminatory nature and purpose. I have called for the repeal of Proclamation 228 virtually every year since 1974 and I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a question: Will the Government abolish that odious proclamation this year? It is a straight question and I ask the hon. the Minister to reply to that when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p>I want to quote from paragraph 1.14 of the report of the Human Sciences Research Council, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Administrative exemption from legislative measures is legally impermissible and undesirable from a policy point of view.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister how that squares with the special permissions, the blanket permits, the so-called international licences which are still required in virtually every sporting situation.</p>

<p><span class="col_363-364" refersTo="page_0193"/>The council then comments&#x2014;and I ask this as a question&#x2014;on various specific laws. It deals with the Group Areas Act, the Liquor Act, the Bantu (Urban Areas) Act, and I want to read what it says about the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act. It says the following in paragraph 4 on page 4&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the committee&#x2019;s opinion it would be artificial to exclude only sport from the discriminatory effect of this Act. In the light of this view the committee feels that this Act in its totality, and not only as applicable to sport, together with other relevant discriminatory legislation, should be subjected to a comprehensive jurisprudential investigation.</block>

<p>I ask now for a statement of intent from the hon. the Minister on the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act.</p>

When specially exempted Black participants have played their sports during the daytime, they will still, when they leave the sports-fields, have to carry a pass. Perhaps they will not be able to eat in the same restaurant as their team mates. [Interjections.] I am not going to listen to hon. members shouting and screaming. It boils down to this: If we South Africans seek friendship, re-entry to the Olympic Games, re-entry into other world and international bodies, if we wish to take our place next to our allies, if we wish to spike the guns of communists, terrorists and agitator-s&#x2014;and we do wish to do all these things&#x2014;then it is the very structure of our society which must be looked at and reformed, and not just sport. This is what I am trying to say. This is what the hon. member for Rissik said to me a few moments ago and I agree with him. It is the very structure of our society which must be looked at and reformed and not just sport.</p>

I have argued for South Africa before the International Cricket Conference when this very Parliament would not allow the members of that Conference to eat in our diningroom, because certain of their members were not Whites. I argued for the re-entry of South Africa into sport amongst those gentlemen. I appeared before Mr. Dicky Jeeps and his British Council of Sport and I argued for the re-entry of South Africa into world sport there. I clashed publicly, in London and in South Africa, with the then British Minister of Sport, Mr. Dennis Howell, because of his attacks on South Africa and its sportsmen. I have clashed publicly in this country with Mr. Hassan Howa at the time when he was chairman of a certain committee because of his attacks on South African sportsmen.

<p>There are two ways in which this hon. Minister can respond to my comment. He may not agree with me, but he can accept the <i>bona fides</i> of his political opponents and my <i>bona fides</i>. He can withdraw the remarks he made in March this year. In that case, we may disagree on issues, but in our different ways we can work towards the same interests of South Africa. On the other hand, the hon. the Minister can stand by his views and by the views expressed in <i>Die Vaderland</i> at that time and at Stellenbosch University about my personal standpoint, in which case our differences will escalate&#x2014;I promise him they will, because I will see to it&#x2014;and he and I and other South Africans will move further and further away from each other to the lasting detriment of our own cause and to the lasting detriment of South African sportsmen.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN NASIONALE OPVOEDING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek dink ons het, afgesien van die onplesierige wanklank wat ons hier teen die einde van die debat gehoor het, &#x2019;n uiters konstruktiewe en <span class="col_367-368" refersTo="page_0195"/>waardevolle bespreking rondom my departement se Begrotingspos gehad en ek wil my waardering hiervoor betuig.</p>

<p>Dit is betreurenswaardig dat ons oor &#x2019;n aangeleentheid soos Suid-Afrika se internasionale sportverhoudinge van die kant van die agb. lid vir Sandton &#x2019;n demonstrasie van die politieke uitbuiting van sport gehad het wat niks en niemand kan bevoordeel en net ons eie sportmense se pogings om op internasionale vlak Suid-Afrika se sportverhoudings te bevorder, kan benadeel. Ek wil graag by hierdie geleentheid hulde bring aan ons sportadministrateurs wat met baie groot persoonlike opoffering in die jongste tyd by die vergadering van die International Cricket Conference, en op die oomblik by die vergadering van die Intemasionale Amateur Atletiekfederasie en met betrekking tot internasionale tennis, hulle uiterste bes doen om die geleentheid wat gebied word deur die feit dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering &#x2019;n aantal jare gelede besluit het om sport te depolitiseer en die outonomie van sportbeheerliggame en sportklubs te erken met die toepassing van veelvolkige deelname aan sport, te gebruik in die bevordering van Suid-Afrika se sportbelange. Dit is uiters betreurenswaardig dat ons hier in Suid-Afrika ter wille van korttermynpartypolitieke gewin die soort optrede soos di&#x00E9; van die agb. lid vir Sandton kry. Volgens &#x2019;n berig in <i>The Star</i> van 27 Julie het die agb. lid vir Sandton weer in verband met die Springboktoer na NieuSeeland ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should the Springboks not come home with dignity before they are kicked out?</block>

<p>Wat kan &#x2019;n mens nou as meer dislojale optrede teenoor Suid-Afrikaanse sportverteenwoordigers in die buiteland beskou, as hulle daar onder moeilike omstandighede aanwesig is, as om hierdie soort van opstokende en opswepende vrae te stel wat eenvoudig die betogers en teenstanders van Suid-Afrikaanse sport in die buiteland net in hulle kwaad sterk? Dan maak die agb. lid ook nog &#x2019;n politieke punt daarvan, soos hy so pas hier gedoen het, deur te s&#x00EA;: &#x201C;Sportsmen cannot and should not be asked to fight the battles of the Nationalist Government.&#x201D; Ek dink hy het ook ges&#x00EA; dat hy die Minister uitdaag om saam met die Springbokke die politieke stryd daar te gaan voer. Terwyl ons sportmanne en sportadministrateurs in moeilike omstandighede in die buiteland verkeer, sleep hy die situasie dus by die partypolitieke stryd in Suid-Afrika in. Ingeval iemand nog nie daaraan gedink het nie, s&#x00EA; die agb. lid ook: &#x201C;After this tour and the damage it has done, will any country ever invite us to tour again?&#x201D; Hy wil seker maak dat hierdie suggestie aan die buitew&#x00EA;reld oorgedra word.</p>

<p><i>Die Burger</i> het ook die agb. lid se vraag of ons manne nie met waardigheid huis toe moet kom nie, in &#x2019;n berig weergegee. Die agb. lid het ges&#x00EA; dat Suid-Afrika in Nieu-Seeland onderwerp is aan die vernederendste vertoning van teenkanting wat Suid-Afrikaanse sportmanne nog beleef het. Watter voordeel behaal ons deur hierdie soort opmerkings te maak? Ek wil graag aanhaal wat Suid-Afrikaanse koerante ges&#x00EA; het na aanleiding van die agb. lid vir Sand-ton se opmerkings in Maart vanjaar. Die <i>Cape Times</i> van 13 Maart het soos volg berig&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The involvement of politicians, whether Opposition or Nationalist, in this matter is totally unnecessary. This newspaper has consistently argued down the years that sport should be left to the sportsmen and the sport administrators.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this is exactly the practice and the policy the Government has been applying and implementing in the past few years. <i>The Cape Times</i> adds&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No section of the electorate wants to play into the hands of boycotters. This is a delicate dilemma.</block>

<p>I commend these remarks of <i>The Cape Times</i> to the hon. member for Sandton. I should also like to quote from <i>The Argus</i> as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We think it is unrealistic at this stage to expect the tour to be stopped by either of the two national bodies who arranged it and we hope it will prove the breakthrough in international rugby that the country needs.</block>

<p><span class="col_369-370" refersTo="page_0196"/>This is how this newspaper commented on the very unfortunate and uncalled for comment of the hon. member for Sandton, about the tour in March. We must have no illusions about this matter. Sport has become politicized in the international arena. In spite of the fact that in this country, as has been insisted over the years, the Government accepted the depoliticization of sport and recognized and acknowledged the autonomy of sports bodies and sports clubs to decide for themselves what they want to do in respect of multi-racial sport, the rest of the world has turned completely topsy-turvy and we have had repeated reports that in international conferences the national sports bodies representing such countries as Australia and India are in fact under the guidance and instructions of their respective Governments. One of the ironies of the situation is what I would call the insolence of the Australian Government in recent times in trying to prescribe to South Africa what it should do with regard to so-called racism in sport. Australia is the country which was recently attacked in a report by the World Council of Churches for the way it is treating its aborigines. This report stated that the Australians are practising a system of genocide against the aborigines through the neglect of the historical, cultural, social and political aspirations of the aboriginal people.</p>

<p>They would at least be reHable in respect of this kind of situation in Australia. Recently a very rich diamond find has been made in Australia, which is estimated to contain almost double the present stocks of industrial diamonds. The Australian Exploration Company paid the aborigines in that area the royal sum of R212 000 for a diamond-field which is expected to yield diamonds to the value of R285 million per year. This is the country which has seen fit to instruct its representative in the International Cricket Council to resist the re-entry of South Africa into international cricket. It is incidentally also the country in respect of which <i>The Star of</i> 24 August reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government of West Australia has just introduced segregation in bars between aborigines and Whites in that State. This sort of international hypocrisy is a fact we have to deal with. Whatever we do inside South Africa will not meet with what these people require of us. In fact, our very distinguished representatives who met with the International Cricket Conference recently, asked the council, since we in South Africa had done every single thing that had been requested of us in the past, what they wanted us to do in addition.</block>

<speech by="#dalling">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. DALLING</person>:</from>

<p>Can I ask the hon. the Minister a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I should like to complete what I have to say. I think it should be very clear that international resistance against South Africa with regard to sport is no longer directed at what is going on in sport, but as the hon. member for Sandton has himself admitted, it is directed at the political and social system in this country. In other words, they are using sport as an instrument or lever to bring about change in South Africa. I think it is most deplorable if any politician in South Africa supports this kind of interference in the internal political system of South Africa by encouraging the use of sport as a lever for this purpose. It is a complete prostitution of sport for purposes other than those with which sport should be properly concerned. I would like to express the extreme disapproval and disappointment of this side of the House of the conduct of the hon. member for Sandton in this regard. I would like to accept that the hon. member for Sandton did contribute, as he has claimed in a very forthright and enthusiastic way, in trying to promote South Africa&#x2019;s position in international sport. I do not doubt what he has said, but I appeal to him to be a fittle more consistent and to continue to be as enthusiastic as he was when he appeared before the Jeeps delegation in promoting the sporting interests of South Africa in the international sphere.</p>

<p><span class="col_371-372" refersTo="page_0197"/>I think our sportsmen can rightly expect our politicians to leave sport to the sportsmen, the sports clubs and the sports administrators and to acknowledge in practice the autonomy of our sportsmen to decide about sporting matters. With regard to the legislation the hon. member for Sandton has referred to, I wish to state that I have made it quite clear that in the case of the three Acts in respect of which the Human Sciences Research Council has recommended that their application in respect of all sporting matters should be scrapped, amending legislation with this intention is in the offing. I had hoped that it would be possible to introduce it in this very short session of Parliament, but this is just not practically possible, as this session is in the main devoted to the discussion of the Budget. If Mr. Van Eyk is going to be charged for trespassing, I will see to it that this matter is looked at immediately. If he acted in accordance with what was agreed upon between my predecessor and the department responsible for the Urban Areas Act, and he was going there with the purpose of assisting with or participating in sports events, he was probably within his full rights. We will investigate the matter and try to put it straight. My only regret is that the hon. member for Sandton has not mentioned this matter to me previously, but instead sought to make a political point of it in this debate. In doing this, I do not think he promoted the interests of sportsmen in South Africa.</p>

<p>I also wish to say that the Government has stated by way of a Press release in May this year that the recommendation of the Human Sciences Research Council that the Government investigates the Separate Amenities Act not only in respect of sport but on a much wider basis, has been accepted and that this investigation is taking place. I trust that the Department of Community Development, which is responsible for this Act, will come forward with proposals early in the next session.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sandton also referred to the lack of adequate amenities for all population groups. I would like to give him the assurance that my department is doing its best to improve the position, to ensure that there are fair opportunities for participation in sport for all population groups. The Department of Community Development is at present responsible for the Community Development Fund, which provides funds to local authorities for amenities in Coloured and Indian areas. The Administration Boards, with the assistance of the so-called Punt Janson Fund, which is a special trust fund established by my predecessor to promote, with the financial assistance of the private sector, the establishment of sporting facilities in Black areas, are also directly active in this respect.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to three concrete examples where this has been done during the past nine or ten months. This will prove that the matter is taken very seriously. Firstly, there was the upgrading of the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, secondly, the upgrading of the George Gough Stadium in Johannesburg, and, thirdly, the upgrading of the Atteridgeville Stadium in Pretoria. I am quite prepared to admit that we still have a long way to go in this respect, but I think that what has been done so far is an indication of the seriousness with which the authorities regard this matter.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, na aanleiding van die sportsituasie, wil ek ook wys op die betreu-renswaardige toestand wat ons in Suid-Afrika het as gevolg van die optrede van die South African Council of Sport. Sacos is &#x2019;n organisasie wie se optrede gekenmerk is deur, aan die een kant, skynheiligheid omdat hulle sport nie as sport behandel nie, maar soos die agb. lid vir Sandton soms doen, dit as &#x2019;n hefboom vir politieke doeleindes gebruik. Die belange van sportmanne is glad nie meer Sacos se oogmerk nie, want sport word deur hulle bloot as &#x2019;n politieke instrument gebruik. Daarby is segs-manne van Sacos deur middel van hulle kontakte in skole en bestuurskomitees besig om blatante intimidasie toe te pas. Daar was onlangs die geval waar &#x2019;n aantal Kleurling-leerlinge op Worcester&#x2014;ek dink daar was 800 van hulle&#x2014;deur die Sacos-beheerde plaaslike sportliggaam wat Kleurling-sport hanteer, geskors is van verdere deelname aan sport omdat hulle aan &#x2019;n byeenkoms deelgeneem het waar daar ook sportspanne van ander bevolkingsgroepe betrokke was. Sacos is in werklikheid besig om nie net sport te benadeel nie, maar ook om die belange van veral die Kleurlinge en Indi&#x00EB;rs wat by Sacos ingeskakel is, op &#x2019;n blatante <span class="col_373-374" refersTo="page_0198"/>wyse te misken en te benadeel. Sacos is verder ook in baie opsigte onverteenwoordigend soos die leiers van beroepsokker, wat oorwegend Swart mense is, aangedui het, kan Sacos wat sokker betref, glad nie namens hulle praat nie. Ons kan nie voortgaan om toe te laat dat hierdie organisasie op so &#x2019;n blatante wyse die belange van sport in Suid-Afrika ondermyn nie. Daarom is dit ook baie duidelik dat wanneer vooraanstaande lede van Sacos vir paspoorte vra om die buiteland te besoek, dit na&#x00EF;ewe onnoselheid sou wees om so &#x2019;n paspoort toe te staan en hulle te help om die giftige werk wat hulle in Suid-Afrika doen in die buiteland te gaan voortsit. Dit is selfverydelend om aan die een kant van jou sportadministrateurs te verwag om die belange van Suid-Afrikaanse sport in die buiteland te gaan bepleit en om aan die ander kant, terselfdertyd as&#x2019;t ware &#x2019;n dolk in hulle rug te steek deur &#x2019;n paspoort aan Sacos-verteenwoordigers te gee om daardie mense te gaan ondermyn. Enige mens wat dit wel meen met Suid-Afrikaanse sport, behoort te besef dat hierdie weiering van paspoorte nie net geregverdig is nie, maar in werklikheid noodsaaklik is.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag verwys na die toesprake van ander agb. lede wat aan die debat deel-geneem het. Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; dat daar baie konstruktiewe bydraes tot hierdie debat was. Ongelukkig het die agb. hoofsprekers van die amptelike Opposisie en van die NRP so &#x2019;n bietjie op &#x2019;n ramkie met net een snaar gespeel, in die sin dat hulle aan die einde van die debat gisteraand maar weer teruggekom het op die ou pleidooi dat hulle darem maar totale oop universiteite wil h&#x00EA;. Ek aanvaar dat agb. lede van hierdie Komitee oor goeie begrip beskik en vind dit dus nie nodig om te herhaal wat ek by &#x2019;n vorige geleentheid in hierdie debat ges&#x00EA; het oor die ongekwalifiseerde oopstelling van tersi&#x00EA;re onderwysinrigtings nie. Ek het tog met groot vreugde daarvan kennis geneem dat die agb. lid vir Pinelands ges&#x00EA; het dat &#x201C;We have no difficulty with universities established in Black or Coloured communities&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I would like to say that if this tolerant and enlightened approach to universities established for specific population groups had been displayed in the same open-minded way from the outset, much unpleasantness could have been avoided in the years and decades gone by. In the past we heard a lot about &#x201C;bush colleges&#x201D; and found a patronizing and derogatory approach to efforts to provide tertiary education for those population groups which up to that stage had not had a noticeable share of tertiary education. There was a denial of the academic justification of founding and establishing universities or technikons for these population groups. I think that we have gone quite some distance in eliciting the response from the hon. member for Pinelands&#x2014;and I think we had a similar response from the hon. member for Durban North&#x2014;that it is now accepted that these institutions can make and will continue to make a worthwhile contribution. Having said this I would like not to elaborate further on what I have said previously.</p>

<p>Another point which I would like to take up is one which I only touched upon in passing during my previous response and that is to associate myself with the appeal made by several hon. members to English-speaking persons to join the teaching profession. I would like to endorse these appeals and, in doing so, I recall that in my own education in Afrikaans schools I derived tremendous benefit from receiving teaching in English by English-speaking persons. I am quite sure that not only by teaching English at Afrikaans schools but also through teaching at schools of their own language, English-speaking teachers&#x2014;and especially male English-speaking teachers&#x2014;have a tremendous contribution to make to the progress of this country. I would, however, say that a rather unfair charge was made through a suggestion by the hon. member for Durban North who said that male English-speaking teachers feel that their chances of promotion are being blocked because&#x2014;as he put it&#x2014;there was a tendency on the part of the education authorities to favour for promotion appointments people who are more favourably inclined towards the political policies of the Government of the day. I think this allegation is quite unfair and an investigation of the situation would reveal that the English-speaking teachers who are being promoted are quite in proportion to their numbers within the profession.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag, in aansluiting by wat die agb. lid vir Virginia vroe&#x00EB;r ges&#x00EA; het, enkele opmerkings maak in verband met die beginselgrondslae <span class="col_375-376" refersTo="page_0199"/>wat die Regering ten opsigte van onderwys volg. Ek wil graag die verkeerde indruk uit die weg ruim dat die Regering se opdrag aan die RGN om ondersoek in te stel na onderwysvoorsiening in die RSA nou skielik alle fundamentele uitgangspunte van die NP se onderwysbeleid op losse skroewe sou geplaas het. Daar is in besonder geen rede om ten opsigte van die Blanke onderwys enige afwyking hoegenaamd deur die Regering te verwag van die lewensbeskoulike beginsels wat neergel&#x00EA; is in die Wet op Nasionale Onderwysbeleid van 1967 nie en in die besonder van die vereiste&#x2014;altans wat die Blanke onderwys betref waarop hier-die wetgewing spesifiek gerig is&#x2014;dat die onderwys o.m. op twee pillare gebaseer moet wees. Die eerste pillaar, soos die agb. lid vir Virginia uitgewys het, is die Christelike grondslag met&#x2014;en dit word in die wetgewing beklemtoon&#x2014;godsdiensvryheid vir alle leerlinge in godsdiensoefening en in godsdiensonderrig op skool. Die tweede pillaar is die bre&#x00EB; Nasionale grondslag van die onderwys en ter wille van die agb. lid vir Johannesburg Noord wil ek s&#x00EA; dat daardie nasionaal met hoofletters gespel word, trouens, elkeen van die letters moet met &#x2019;n hoofletter gespel word, want s&#x00F3; belangrik is dit.</p>

<p>Wat die Regering betref, het die aanvra van &#x2019;n ondersoek geen jota of tittel verander aan die beginselgrondslag van ons Blanke onderwys nie. Ek wil graag daarop wys dat hierdie twee grondslae maar nie net versiersels is nie, maar soos ek ook vantevore vanjaar ges&#x00EA; het, indien onderwysers in die buiteland ge werf word, sal ook aan hierdie vereistes tydens die werwing en by die beoordeling van die geskiktheid van kandidate voldoen moet word. Soos reeds in die verlede gedoen waar onderwysdepartemente in die buiteland gaan werf het, sal &#x2019;n mens sekerheid moet kry dat die kandidate nie net in staat is nie, maar ook gewillig is om hul onderwys met inagneming van hierdie twee beginselgrondslae te beoefen.</p>

<p>Ek wil my ook graag aansluit by &#x2019;n opmerking wat die Administrateur van Transvaal gemaak het toe hy onlangs tydens &#x2019;n debat in die Provinsiale Raad na hierdie aangeleentheid verwys het. Ek haal aan uit die <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> van 21 Augustus, hoewel dit &#x2019;n koerant is waaruit ek nie dikwels aanhaal nie. Die berig lui&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Winding up the second reading stage of the budget debate, the Administrator said there was an agreement between the province and the university to train teachers according to certain principles and guidelines laid down in the 1967 Act. One was that children should be brought up in a Christian national spirit and that teachers should be able to perform this duty. If it became apparent that these principles were being ignored, he would use any legislative power at his disposal to terminate the agreement.</block>

<p>He was referring to the agreement with the institution undertaking this training. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have to take the provisions of the Act into account, the Administrator said, and if there is any reason to believe that they are being ignored I would have to act.</block>

<p>Ek wil dit baie duidelik stel dat ek die standpunt van die Administrateur ten voile onderskryf. Hy kan niks anders doen as hy verantwoordelik wil optree nie.</p>

<p>Na aanleiding van die opmerkings van die agb. lid vir Virginia wil ek graag ook daarop wys dat die ondersoek van die RGN geen twyfel kan laat oor die verklaarde en ondubbelsinnige beleid van die NP dat elke bevolkingsgroep hul eie skole moet h&#x00EA; nie. Ingevolge die NP se beleid aangaande die erkenning van die werklikheid van volkere-verskeidenheid, die noodsaak van vertikale differensiasie, tesame met selfbeskikkingsreg vir elke bevolkingsgroep oor sy eie aange-leenthede, is die konsekwensie dat elke bevolkingsgroep in beginsel ook sy eie skole moet kan beheer en bestuur. Dit behels vanselfsprekend die vereiste van hul eie onderwysstruktuur, dus &#x2019;n eie onderwysdepartement vir elke bevolkingsgroep. Die redes vir hierdie uitgangspunt is velerlei. In die eerste plek is dit, soos ek pas betoog het, noodsaaklik <span class="col_377-378" refersTo="page_0200"/>met die oog op die praktiese uitoefening van selfbeskikking deur die betrokke bevolkingsgroep oor die onderwys in sy eie skole. In die tweede plek, soos die agb. lid vir Virginia betoog het, is dit nodig omdat onderwys kultuurgebonde is en gerig is op die oordrag, die bewaring en die uitbou van die betrokke kultuurgroep of gemeenskap se eie waardes. Niemand kan werklik namens &#x2019;n ander groep sy kuituur vir hom s&#x00F3; bevorder as wat hy dit self kan doen nie. &#x2019;n Verdere rede is dat eie departemente ook prakties noodsaaklik is met die oog op die eiesoortige opvoedkundige ontwikkelings probleme van elke bepaalde bevolkingsgroep. Dit verg beslis &#x2019;n gedifferensieerde strategie vir die noodsaaklike onderwysontwikkeling wat daar in hierdie land nog ten opsigte van talie groepe moet plaasvind. Les bes, is eie departemente ook noodsaaklik in &#x2019;n gedifferensieerde vorm omdat &#x2019;n eenheidstelsel van een onderwysdepartement vir alle bevolkingsgroepe &#x2019;n onhanteerbare monster, &#x2019;n behemot, &#x2019;n reus, &#x2019;n onpersoonlike massa van &#x2019;n departementele organisasie sou meebring. Selfs al sou &#x2019;n mens die ideologiese uitgangspunt van die Opposisie aanvaar, sal &#x2019;n mens se gesonde verstand tog vir jou moet s&#x00EA; dat so &#x2019;n massale groot sentrale onderwysdepartement vir alle bevolkingsgroepe net nie behoorlik sal kan werk nie.</p>

<p>Die beleid van selfbeskikking, soos dit ook na die onderwys moet deurwerk, sal ongetwyfeld ingrypende wysigings van die huidige onderwysopset vereis. Die huidige opset in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika is <i>de facto</i> een van Blanke beheer en gesag, dus ook oor die onderwys van ander bevolkingsgroepe. Om weg te kom van hierdie onaanvaarbare en volgens die beleid van die Regering verkeerde Blanke oorheersing van die onderwys van ander bevolkingsgroepe is die uitweg beslis nie om &#x2019;n enkele, sentraalbeheerde eenheidstelsel in te stel waar ander dominasies in die plek van die huidige Blanke oorheersing, sal ontstaan nie. Dit is egter wel nodig dat differensiasie volgens bevolkingsgroep ter wille van selfbeskikking gehandhaaf moet word. Soos die agb. lid vir Virginia tereg daarop gewys het moet ons, benewens en naas differensiasie en selfbeskikking met eie onderwysdepartemente egter ook erkenning gee aan die behoefte aan strukture van oorleg en ko&#x00F6;r-dinasie en veral van die stel en handhawing van gesamentlike standaarde en norme op &#x2019;n tussen-departementele vlak ten opsigte van die onderwysstelsels vir alle bevolkingsgroepe. Die sentrale ko&#x00F6;rdineringstrukture sal moet aanpas by die nuwe konstitusionele strukture vir die kombinasie van selfbeskikking en mede-verantwoordelikheid tussen die Blankes, Indi&#x00EB;rs en Asi&#x00EB;rs binne die RSA waaroor op die oomblik onderhandel word. Dit sal ook moet aanpas by die strukture van samewerking tussen die RSA en die Swart onafhanklike state omdat onderwysbelange ook op &#x2019;n regionale grondslag in Suider-Afrika gemeenskaplike elemente het. &#x2019;n Sentrale gesamentlike onderwysstruktuur gebaseer op tussen-volkige grondslag om die ko&#x00F6;rdineringsbehoefte te bevredig, kan ingevolge die Regering se beleidsuitgangspunte slegs gebou word op duidelike, doeltreffende, afsonderlike onderwysdepartemente vir elke bevolkingsgroep. Hierdie departemente moet ook gesag h&#x00EA; om die betrokke bevolkingsgroep se onderwys te bestuur en te beheer. Daar moet ook voorsiening gemaak word vir inspraak en beheer deur die gemeenskap van daardie bevolkingsgroep deur middel van sy konstitusionele organe in die beheer van sy onderwys. Dit is so ingevolge die beleid van selfbeskikking. Ek wil dit weer s&#x00EA;&#x2014;en ek wil dit baie duidelik stel&#x2014;dat sommige mense onder die illusie verkeer het dat die Regering die beleid wat hy duidelik uitgespel het en wat hy ook dwarsdeur die verkiesing duidelik verkondig het, nou skielik sou gaan prysgee het omdat hy &#x2019;n RGN-ondersoek aangevra het wat ook oor &#x2019;n groot duisternis van ander aangeleent-hede&#x2014;benewens die kwessie waarna ek verwys het&#x2014;gaan en waaroor ondersoek ingestel en aanbevelings gemaak moet word.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ook iets s&#x00EA; na aanleiding van opmerkings wat &#x2019;n hele aantal agb. lede gemaak het in verband met die kunste. Ek wil dit stel dat die Regering graag &#x2019;n ver-trouensverhouding en &#x2019;n gesindheid van hartelikheid tussen kunstenaars en die Regering wil skep en vertroetel. Hy wil dit doen sonder om te bewerkstellig dat die politiek op die outonomie en die artistieke integriteit van die kunstenaars&#x2014;waarop hulle baie gesteld is&#x2014;inbreuk sal maak. Die outonomie <span class="col_379-380" refersTo="page_0201"/>van die kunstenaar word gerespekteer so lank hy binne die perke van die landswette bly. Die Regering wil ook graag hierdie vertrouensverhouding koester sonder dat die burokrasie te veel in die kunsw&#x00EA;reld betrek word. Verder wil die Regering, soos ek vroe&#x00EB;r vanjaar na samesprekings met leidende persone uit die w&#x00EA;reld van die beeldende kunste ges&#x00EA; het, groter reg laat geskied aan die professionele beoefening van die kunste en nie slegs aan die amateurkunstenaars nie. Dit is ook die verklaarde voorneme van die Regering&#x2014;soos ek dit destyds in die verklaring gestel het wat na die samesprekings uitgereik is&#x2014;om groter reg te laat geskied aan die bevordering van die kunste onder alle bevolkingsgroepe en daarom is lede van al die bevolkingsgroepe oenoem om te dien in die kommissie wat ingaan op die hele kwessie van die bevordering van die kunste. Ek wil dit beklemtoon dat die land en al die gemeenskappe die kunstenaars nodig het. Hulle vervul &#x2019;n uiters belangrike rigtinggewende en toekomsbepalende rol in die gemeenskap. Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; na aanleiding van die opmerkings van lie agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Noord dat ek aamstem dat vir die voortbestaan van &#x2019;n gemeenskap nie net politieke, ekonomiese en milit&#x00EA;re weerbaarheid van belang is nie, maar dat die gehalte van die skeppende kunste uiteindelik van bepalende belang is om die gehalte van die kultuurlewe wat die eintlike motivering vir die voortbestaan van &#x2019;n gemeenskap is, te help vorm.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n groot aantal aangeleenthede wat verder deur verskillende agb. lede geopper is. Wat betref die aangeleentheid wat verband hou met die sogenaamde M plus twee jaar onderwysmense in bevordering-svlakke, wil ek graag aan die agb. lid vir Greytown s&#x00EA; dat die bepaling dat die minimumkwalifikasies vir die professie ten minste drie jaar opleiding na matriek moet wees, destyds neergel&#x00EA; is op aandrang van die georganiseerde professie en op aandrang van die verskillende onderwysdepartemente. Dit sou ernstige probleme skep indien &#x2019;n mens van hierdie minimumbepaling sou afwyk. Dit is dikwels so dat iemand in &#x2019;n organisasie in &#x2019;n beheersituasie verkeer terwyl hy &#x2019;n geringer salaris kry as &#x2019;n besonder voortreflik-gekwalifiseerde persoon wat formeel in die hi&#x00EB;rargie onder hom staan. Dit is in organisatoriese opsig nie vreemd nie. Verder sou afwykings van die re&#x00EB;ling die status van die beroep weer in die gedrang bring as sou dit &#x2019;n onder-gekwalifiseerde beroep wees indien toegewings gemaak sou word. Verder is die georganiseerde professie van mening dat afwykings van hierdie vereistes deur tegemoetkoming die aanmoediging wat daar tans bestaan vir persone om hul kwalifikasies te verbeter, sou verminder.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Rustenburg het gistermiddag verwys na die belangrikheid van onderwys vir verstandelik-vertraagde kinders. Ek wil met hom saamstem dat ons almal baie groot waardering het vir die onderwysers wat hul aan die onderwys van gestremdes oor die algemeen&#x2014;d.w.s. aan buitengewone onderwys&#x2014;wy. Dit is &#x2019;n veeleisende en in baie opsigte &#x2019;n senutergende soort onderwys. Dit vereis besondere opleidingskwalifikasies asook besondere persoonlikheidskwaliteite en les bes, baie groot liefde en toewyding. Daarom wil ek my baie graag by die agb. lid vir Rustenburg aansluit om die belangrikheid van hierdie sektor van die onderwys te beklemtoon. Ek wil ook graag &#x2019;n paar gegewens onder die Komitee se aandag bring oor die ho&#x00EB; finansi&#x00EB;le eise wat buitengewone onderwys&#x2014;dus onderwys vir gestremdes&#x2014;aan die Staatskas stel. Soos u weet, is di&#x00E9; soort onderwys gesentraliseerd sover dit die Blankes betref op &#x2019;n nasionale grondslag in die Departement van Nasionale Opvoeding. Ek het &#x2019;n vinnige berekening gemaak om te kyk wat die uitgawe per hoof vir hierdie verskillende kategorie&#x00EB; van gestremdes is. In die geval van liggaamlik en neuraalgestremdes beloop dit byna R4 400 per kop per jaar. In die geval van sintuiglik-gestremdes beloop dit meer as R4 900 per kop per jaar. In die geval van geesteslikver-traagdes is dit net meer as R4 000 per kop per jaar. In die geval van outistiese kinders kon ek nie die juiste syfer bekom nie, maar dit is nog baie ho&#x00EB;r as in genoemde gevalle. &#x2019;n Mens twyfel soms oor die doeltreffendheid en die geregverdigheid van hierdie onderwys as jy op die koste let. Dit wil dikwels voorkom asof &#x2019;n mens met &#x2019;n hopelose graad van gestremdheid te doen het. As &#x2019;n mens die aangrypende ervaring deurmaak om hierdie skole te besoek, het jy soms die gevoel dat jy met onherstelbare menslike wrakke te doen het. Nadat ek self ook twyfelvrae oor hierdie aangeleentheid gestel het en die skole gaan besoek het, wil ek dit hier <span class="col_381-382" refersTo="page_0202"/>as my oortuiging stel dat dit &#x2019;n ten volle geregverdigde belegging is en dat wonders verrig word deur middel van die terapie wat toegepas word op hierdie o&#x00EB;nskynlike menslike wrakke. Daarby is die wetenskap&#x2014;veral die mediese wetenskap&#x2014;telkens besig om vordering te maak in die lig waarvan ons verbeterde diagnose en terapie kan toepas wat ook kan lei tot die beter opvoeding van hierdie gestremdes. Ek wil ook graag die noodsaaklikheid by alle belanghebbendes inskerp dat gestremdes betyds ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer moet word en dit is ook &#x2019;n punt waarna die agb. lid vir Rustenburg verwys het. Hierdie mense moet betyds ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer word omdat die ervaring daarop dui dat hoe vroe&#x00EB;r &#x2019;n gestremde aan die regte deskundige onderwys onderwerp word, hoe beter die geleentheid is om &#x2019;n relatiewe sukses van sy onderwys te maak. Nog &#x2019;n punt wat ons nie moet vergeet nie, is die groot maatskaplike verligting&#x2014;nie net aan die betrokke gestremde wat &#x2019;n beter kans het om in die gemeenskap aan te pas nie&#x2014;maar ook vir sy gesin en sy onmiddellike omgewing wat, indien die onderwys van so &#x2019;n gestremde relatief suksesvol is, van &#x2019;n baie swaar versorgingslas verlig word. Dit dra dus ook op &#x2019;n indirekte wyse by tot die beter aanwending van ons mannekrag en tot die verwydering van frustrasie in ons samelewing.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Stilfontein het &#x2019;n aantal belangrike en interessante opmerkings gemaak meer om dit sag te stel, meen ek dat dit soms nogal ketters is sover dit die diensvoorwaardes van onderwysers betref. Ek meen dat ek verstandiger sou handel indien ek liewer die Federale Raad op hom sou loslaat as om die saak volledig hier te beredeneer. Ek wil egter een punt waarna hy verwys het, met waardering onderstreep en dit is die noodsaak dat die hoofde van skole&#x2014;ek sou s&#x00EA; onderwysbestuurders in die algemeen&#x2014;ook in die bestuurskuns opgelei moet word. &#x2019;n Skool, kollege, trouens enige opvoedkundige inrigting is een van die mees veeleisende en ingewikkelde menslike organisasies en die kennis wat ons in die be-stuurswetenskap opgedoen het, kan wel deeglik aangewend word om die doeltreffende aanwending van die opvoedkundiges by sulke inrigtings te verbeter.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ook waardering betuig vir die opmerkings wat gemaak is deur die agb. lid vir Ermelo wat met &#x2019;n baie goed voorbereide betoog ten behoewe van die uitvoerende kunste gekom het. Ek meen egter nie dat die agb. lid hier teenwoordig is nie &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ek is jammer, mnr. die Voorsitter, ek het gedink dat die agb. lid nie hier sou wees nie. Ek wil graag s&#x00EA; dat die verslag van die Niemand-kommissie wat van 1977 af oorstaan deur my volledig deurgewerk is en dat ek verskillende aanbevelings aan die nasionale Advieskomitee oor die Uitvoerende Kunste voorgel&#x00EA; het en hulle het dit so aanvaar. Ek het ook ander lastige punte uit die Niemand-verslag na hulle verwys vir verdere studie met die oog op implementering. Ek wil nie die Komitee se tyd verder in beslag neem nie en daarom sal ek eersdaags in &#x2019;n persvrystelling algemeen bekend maak watter vordering in hierdie verband gemaak is. Ek wil my spyt uitspreek dat dit so lank geduur het voordat hierdie belangrike kommissie se verslag die hele pad geloop het. Die rede was egter dat die belangrike rol van die provinsies ten opsigte van die uitvoerende kunste en ook ander belanghebbende instansies tot &#x2019;n langdurige proses van oorlegpleging gelei het wat eers teen die middel van verlede jaar voltooi is. Ek sal graag in besonder aandag skenk aan die twee wenke van die agb. lid vir Ermelo dat fasiliteite vir die opleiding van teatertegno-lo&#x00EB; by die technikon te Pretoria verbeter moet word, en dat ons aandag moet skenk aan die instandhouding van gemeenskaptea-ters in kleiner gemeenskappe, veral op die platteland asook die fasiliteite in daardie teaters om dit vir besoekende geselskappe moontlik te maak om daar doelmatige uitvoerings te kan gee.</p>

<p>Ek verwys ook na die besondere kundige bydrae van die agb. lid vir Koedoespoort rondom die museumwese. Ook hier het ons &#x2019;n belangrike verslag&#x2014;ook &#x2019;n Niemand-verslag&#x2014;omtrent die museumwese wat omtrent vier jaar gelede voltooi is. Die nuwe advieskomitee vir museums wat intussen in-gestel is, is besig om aan die belangrikste wenke van daardie kommissie wat nog nie uitgevoer is nie, aandag te skenk. Om ook hier tyd te bespaar sal ek in die nabye toekoms by wyse van &#x2019;n persvrystelling die publiek inlig oor watter vordering in hierdie verband gemaak is. Ongelukkig moet ek aan <span class="col_383-384" refersTo="page_0203"/>die agb. lid vir Koedoespoort s&#x00EA; dat my departement nie fondse beskikbaar het om museums van provinsies of van plaaslike besture te finansier nie. Daar word wel in die nuwe Wetsontwerp op Finansi&#x00EB;le Verhoudings o.m. voorgestel dat die bevoegdhede van die provinsies ten opsigte van museumaangeleenthede uitgebrei word en ek vertrou dat op daardie wyse die hantering van hierdie aangeleentheid bevorder sal word.</p>

<p>Ek het reeds na die agb. lid vir Durban-Noord verwys in my aanvanklike opmerkings en daarom kom ek nou by die agb. lid vir Rosettenville se Formule-1 Grand Prix en sy nasionale sokkersportstadion. Dit is &#x2019;n moeilike saak om in verband met professionele sport soos motorsport op die Formu-le-l-vlak Staatssteun te verleen. Die Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens is egter wel reeds behulpsaam op &#x2019;n beperkte skaal om die deelnemers aan daardie wedren en hul voertuie hierheen en hiervandaan te vervoer. Ons probeer aandag skenk aan die moontlikheid om die saak verder te bevorder, maar die probleem is dat die Staat tot dusver hom weerhou het van die finansiering van professionele sport. Wat die oprigting van die nasionale sportstadion&#x2014;en veral sokkerstadion&#x2014;suid van Johannesburg betref, kan ek met waardering daarna verwys dat die werkgroep onder leiding van mnr. Charles Skeene wat deur die Kabinet benoem is om hierdie aangeleentheid te hanteer, vordering maak, maar dat hulle &#x2019;n groot verantwoorde-likheid het omdat die omvattende finan-sieringskoste van hierdie projek groot is. Die Regering se standpunt is dat hy die R13 miljoen vir die aankoop van die grond beskikbaar gestel het met die veronderstelling dat daar dan &#x2019;n nutsmaatskappy opgerig sal word wat ook met die steun van die privaat-sektor die taak van die oprigting van hierdie stadion van die Regering se skouers sal afneem sodat daar nie &#x2019;n lastige presedent geskep word dat die Regering so &#x2019;n groot fasiliteit vir sport oprig nie. Dit is onvermydelik dat die Regering wel &#x2019;n aansienlike bydrae sal lewer maar hierdie werkgroep is besig om metodes uit te werk om te help verseker dat indien hierdie projek uiteinde-lik winsgewend word, die Regering &#x2019;n deel van sy belegging sal kan verhaal.</p>

<p>Aan die agb. lid vir Uitenhage wat &#x2019;n baie goeie en kundige bydrae gelewer het, wil ek die versekering gee dat sodra ons die De Lange-verslag wat ook aan rekenaaronder-steunde onderrig aandag gegee het, oorweeg het, ons &#x2019;n baie ho&#x00EB; prioriteit daaraan sal gee om die implementering van opvoedkun-digverantwoorde rekenaarondersteunde onderrig in Suid-Afrika te bespoedig en te bevorder. Daar is verskeie private instansies wat reeds hulp in hierdie opsig beloof het en kundigheid beskikbaar gestel het en nog verder sal stel om die saak te bevorder. Ek stem met die agb. lid saam dat rekenaarondersteunde onderrig &#x2019;n baie groot bydrae kan lewer om die trefwydte van &#x2019;n bekwame en kundige onderwyser te vergroot sodat hy meer leerlinge kan bereik as wat hy in die konvensionele klaskamersituasie kan bereik. Ons sal dus met groot belangstelling en sorg aandag aan hierdie saak skenk.</p>

<p>Ek wil net graag ten slotte die agb. lid vir Kuruman bedank vir sy positiewe bydrae oor sport in teenstelling met die uiters negatiewe benadering wat daarna deur die agb. lid vir Sandton openbaar is, maar ek meen ek het reeds afdoende daarmee gehandel. Ek wil graag afsluit deur nogmaals my waardering uit te spreek aan alle lede wat nie net tot die debat bygedra het nie, maar ook moeite gedoen het om kundige en ingeligte kritiek en wenke na vore te bring. Ek wil hulle die versekering gee dat my departement en ek hierdie sake verder sal opvolg en waar ons enigsins in staat is, dit sal probeer implementeer. Ten slotte nou &#x2019;n woord van hartelike dank aan die agb. Swepe vir die re&#x00EB;ling van die debat. Ook aan die Stoel wil ek my hartelike waardering betuig.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can give the hon. member my categoric assurance that Proclamation 228 is included in the whole framework of legislation that will have to be changed. I cannot, however, give him the assurance that it will be changed this year because it affects much more than just sport. The Group Areas Act is to be revised <span class="col_385-386" refersTo="page_0204"/>in a more comprehensive way and I have been given the assurance by my colleague, the hon. Minister of Community Development, that this will receive a very high priority, as it has in fact been receiving, and that it would be coming up early next year. As far as trim parks are concerned the department is not directly responsible. It provides local authorities with limited assistance for establishing trim parks. The policy of the Government is that it acknowledges the autonomy of local authorities in respect of the way in which they make their facilities available. However, I agree with the hon. member for Sandton that trim parks should play a very important role in all communities, especially in those townships which are provided with fewer amenities than others. My department is giving priority attention to the provision of trim parks in such townships. Although I cannot lay my hands upon them, I have some examples but I can assure the hon. member that this is a matter which will receive priority attention.</p>

<p>Ons is die agb. Minister baie vriendelik gesind en daarom wil ek die hoop uitspreek dat hy die HNP in Piketberg die loef gaan afsteek. Ek s&#x00EA; dit om twee redes. In die eerste plek weet ons dat die agb. Minister in die geheim filosofie&#x00EB; en beginsels handhaaf en bely wat in baie opsigte met di&#x00E9; van die PFP ooreen-kom. [Tussenwerpsels.] In die tweede plek wil ons graag h&#x00EA; dat die agb. Minister teen die HNP moet wen omdat die HNP se beginsels en beleidsrigtings uit die oertyd kom. Dit kom uit die dae van die beginsels van nasionalisme en apartheid van dr. Malan en dr. Verwoerd. Om daardie redes is ons so vriendelik om die agb. Minister die beste toe te wens met die tussenverkiesing.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Vote we are dealing with is a very comprehensive and wide-ranging Vote. It deals with industries, commerce and tourism, but in particular it is a Vote which deals with the economy of South Africa and with all aspects of that economy. South Africa is experiencing at this very moment a period of extensive social, economic and political change. Some people would call it a revolution. That is a word with an unpopular connotation, but I think that it is in fact appropriate to the changes that are taking place and that will be taking place, whether we like it or not, in the course of the next decade or two in our country. It is relatively peaceful at this stage and, obviously, we should attempt to keep it peaceful. What is important is that no force on earth can stop the changes from taking place. I think one must understand that. What an enlightened Government would do&#x2014;it is in that spirit that I want to address the hon. the Minister today&#x2014;would be to seek means by which it could guide and facilitate these changes. It would under no circumstances attempt to frustrate the inevitable changes which are taking place. If the Government would do that, it would in fact be making a contribution to the prevention of violence in our society.</p>

<p>I would like to address myself to this hon. Minister because he has a key role to play in this process. He can take the enlightened and courageous steps which are essential to ease South Africa away from the unfortunate path of the exploitation and injustice which has characterized our way of life in South Africa over the past decades onto a new path of racial co-operation which could lead to a future of peace and prosperity. Alternatively, he could fail in his present post by continuing to see his responsibilities, viz. of guiding and directing the economy of South Africa, merely as another tool in the process of executing the policy of apartheid. He can either see his job as one of providing for South Africa a sound and growing economy with job opportunities and a growth rate appropriate to our requirements, thus providing a better life for all the citizens of this country, or he can continue to abuse the economy of the country to achieve the ends of apartheid. If he does the former, he will be making a magnificent contribution to peace and prosperity in this society, but if he does the latter, he will be contributing to plunging our country into violence.</p>

<p>Let us talk about the practical steps which we see as vital in order to achieve the objective of bringing about a peaceful and stable society and prosperity for all our people. There are many features by which one can determine the economic situation in the country. There are innumerable analyses, <span class="col_389-390" refersTo="page_0210"/>charts and findings which one can look at. I want to look at two of the many that are available. The first relates to the productivity in our society. At this early stage I should like to make one point very clear, and that is that, when one goes through an economic revolution, when one goes through economic changes such as we are going through, one must introduce into those particular changes a very strong commitment on the part of society to the concept of rewarding productivity. Let me say what I mean by that in the simplest sense. We shall soon, I hope, reach the situation where all South African citizens will be able to find jobs to help the economy of the country. We shall be reaching the situation where far better salaries and wages will be paid. I should like the payment or rewarding of the workers in our society not to be based in the first place on the job they do, but on merit and on their productivity and their contribution to the economy of the society.</p>

<p>A very interesting set of figures is those setting out the rate of growth in the gross domestic product per capita in our country as compared with other countries. Figures have been published recently comparing the growth from 1972 to 1979. I want to quote them briefly to show hon. members where we stand. For Australia the figure is 1,66; West Germany 2,58; Israel 0,98; Japan 3,35; Kenya 2,35; Portugal 1,48; the Republic of South Africa 0,21; Spain 2,30; the Republic of China 6,89; the UK 1,50; and Zambia -1,59.</p>

<p>The second set of figures I should like to refer to is those indicating what is needed in terms of the growth rate in South Africa to meet the job requirements in our society. The position is that, if we have a growth rate of 3,6&#x0025;, the unemployment figure for 1982 will be approximately 1 815 000 and for 1987 2 406 000. If we have a growth rate of 5&#x0025;, which requires over 1 000 new jobs to be created per day, the unemployment figure for 1982 will be 1 495 000 and for 1987 it will be reduced to 1 262 000. Because I lack the time, I cannot go into the many other very interesting figures which have been produced and which indicate what our economic situation is.</p>

<p>What can be done in order to achieve the necessary economic growth in our society and the necessary economic stability and prosperity? Sir, one can deal with this in a gentle way or one can deal with it in terms of the harsh realities of the situation and the harsh steps which, from the Government&#x2019;s point of view, will have to be taken to correct the situation. The hon. the Minister, as Minister responsible for the economy of the country and as a member of the Cabinet and the Government, has a responsibility to see to it that his colleagues take the necessary steps in this connection. In the very first place the hon. the Minister must see to it that the Government scraps all ideological legislation which interferes with the mechanism of a free economy in our society.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. One cannot have a free economy in an apartheid society. One cannot have a free economy in a country with a society and an environment that is not free. The hon. member opposite asked what steps must be taken. The race classification legislation which divides people into categories according to the colour of their skin must be scrapped, as must the Act which rests on race classification, namely the Group Areas Act, which in effect says to a person that, irrespective of his intelligence, his honesty, his competence, his dedication and loyalty and all the good things he may stand for and believe in, because of the colour of his skin he cannot live where he wishes to live, he cannot attend school where he wishes to attend school, he cannot work where he wishes to work, and he cannot open or operate a business where he wishes to do so. It tells him, in effect, that the colour of his skin determines where he will live, where he will go to school and where he will operate a business. Then there are all the laws which interfere with the mobility of Black labour. Black people in South Africa cannot move about as they wish.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. P. A. SCHUTTE</person>:</from>

<p>They end up squatting all around the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Black people, whether they squat or not, cannot move around the country freely in order to get the best possible price for their labour. Then there is the inferior Black education <span class="col_391-392" refersTo="page_0211"/>which does not prepare people adequately to participate effectively in the country&#x2019;s economy and there is the Black housing in respect of which there is such a backlog. In Soweto not a single house was built last year for Black people. I believe that in the last ten years&#x2014;other hon. members will have the exact figures&#x2014;virtually no houses were built for Black people in the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we require an entirely new approach to education and training, housing and the creation of job opportunities in order to introduce the Black people of this country into the free enterprise system in the economy so that they can be stimulated by the profit motive of the free enterprise system, so that they can make a contribution and so that they can fully exploit their own talents and abilities in order to obtain a better income and thereby a better quality of fife for themselves and their families. In the first place, then, I want to tell the hon. the Minister that it is his responsibility to leave no stone unturned in the Cabinet and the Government to see to it that we erase from the Statute Book the myriad laws which determine that on the basis of skin colour Black, Indian and Coloured people neither have the opportunities nor can make the contributions which we as White people have and can make.</p>

<p>The next thing the Government must do&#x2014;and this is also the responsibility of the hon. the Minister operating in association with the other members of the Cabinet&#x2014;is to put an end once and for all to the overregulation by the Government of the economy of our society. I want to make it clear that I am not saying that regulation is not necessary in certain respects. I am not saying that Government planning or direction, from a central basis is not necessary in certain instances. I am not saying that some forms of control are not necessary in a modern economy. What I am saying is that one way or another through a myriad of control boards, agencies, commissions, committees, thousands of regulations, bureaucracies &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. D. S. DURR</person>:</from>

<p>Which regulations?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>All the control boards, for instance, with all the regulations at their disposal and the huge bureaucracies they operate&#x2014;I shall come to what other people say just now&#x2014;have in fact served to place a stranglehold on the country&#x2019;s economy, and I believe that that stranglehold must be broken. One has to unleash the initiative of the people to become effective entrepreneurs in order to build up and expand the economy of our society.</p>

<p>There are lots of things that can be done. Do you know, Sir, that for instance the contribution of manufacturing to the gross domestic product, which was 6&#x0025; in 1916, grew to 19&#x0025; in 1946 and 23&#x0025; in 1976? What I am saying is that here we have an opportunity for further growth. Less than 10&#x0025; of our output is exported at present. Our domestic industry provides less than 70&#x0025; of the goods required in our own market. The manufacturing sector can therefore in fact expand considerably. Now the hon. the Prime Minister said in the Carlton Hotel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I believe we in Government must understand that economic growth as such is mostly the responsibility of private enterprise. Of course Governments have a key role to play in areas such as the creation of the physical and social infrastructure. Essentially, however, it is private enterprise which combines all the elements of production to produce wealth. No Government can successfully prescribe to private enterprise what to produce, how to produce, for whom to produce and where to invest.</block>

<p>Those were very fine words. It is almost two years ago that the hon. the Prime Minister made that speech, and virtually every economist in South Africa, whether he is attached to a university or is in industry and commerce, who has made a study of the situation and has compared the realities with the expressed sentiments of the Government, has come to the conclusion that, since those fine words were spoken, virtually nothing effective has been done in practice to give effect to the intentions that were expressed. I could quote a hundred authorities for that, but this afternoon I shall quote only one or two. Professor Jan Lombard of the University of Pretoria, who is not a Prog but a member of the NP &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from><span class="col_393-394" refersTo="page_0212"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I understand that he is a supporter of the NP. He may not be for long; he may see the light and come over to our side. In any event, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Market forces in South Africa were shackled by the tremendous array of regulatory devices available to the authorities. Neither the conduct nor the structure of the economy was greatly demonstrative of the idea of a free market economy.</block>

<p>He blamed the myriad of regulatory devices on what he termed &#x201C;an almost incredible lack of understanding of the role of prices in the free market economy.&#x201D; It is quite clear that this gentleman is joined by hundreds of others who say in the clearest possible language that the Government is not taking effective steps to free the economic system in this country from the shackles of the laws and bureaucracy it has created. The Government cannot expect us to deliver the goods if it on its side does not meet the requirements in this particular case.</p>

<p>Let me quote another gentleman, Mr. Van Heerden, who is the public relations officer of the Development and Finance Corporation. I assume that he too is not a member of the PFP. I assume he also supports the Government. He works for an organization which is closely linked with the Government. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has done more to destroy small business than any other organization. South African legislation discourages small business.</block>

<p>The point I want to make is that this gentleman, who is an authority, says not that the Government is not doing anything to help, but that the Government is doing everything in its power to destroy. I think that the hon. the Minister must take note of this.</p>

<p>I can mention many hundreds of examples which are on record, but let me give just one example of how the Government, with its absolute obsession for apartheid, is destroying the country&#x2019;s economy. This is in connection with an industrialist called Jan Pretorius who operates a small business somewhere on the West Rand. He was forced to erect a wire fence two metres high to segregate his Coloured workers from their White colleagues. As I said, this is a small business on the West Rand and in terms of Government law he had to erect this fence. I quote him&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because I employed Coloureds to build trailers on one side of the factory and one White artisan in the panel-beating section on the other side, they forced me to erect a 2 metre high fence between the two sections. The only entrance wide enough to accommodate the lorry delivering steel to my factory is on the wrong side of the fence. I had to apply for special permission &#x2026;</block>

<p>Nogal! I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to instal a gate in the fence so that these steel sections could be carried through to the stores section. I had to sign an undertaking that the gate would be used only for this purpose and that it would remain locked at all times.</block>

<p>There are hundreds of examples I can give of this sort of thing that has been taking place. If it had been Blacks working in the same place with Whites, I assume it would have had to be a ten-foot high concrete wall with machine guns and searchlights situated at strategic points. Mr. Etheridge, who is one of the leading mining executives in the country, had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A major advance in free enterprise is not possible within the apartheid philosophy and while discriminatory laws pervade the life of the majority of people.</block>

<p>All these statements&#x2014;and there are hundreds more&#x2014;have been made in the last few months. They were not made a year ago, but in the last three or four months. What I am trying to say is that the Government can talk as much as it likes, its members can go and speak in America and make all sorts of promises, it can use its rhetoric and change its terminology, but until such time as it has the courage and the insight to dismantle apartheid, to destroy it, to remove it, it will not bring about progress in the achievement of a strong, growing and more prosperous economy in our society.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one more point which <span class="col_395-396" refersTo="page_0213"/>is very important, and that is the question of decentralization, or rather &#x201C;deconcentration&#x201D;&#x2014;we always get different words for the same thing. The Government now calls it deconcentration. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that he can by all means decentralize or deconcentrate, because it is a sound economic principle, but that he must please do it on sound economic grounds, and not for ideological reasons of apartheid. If he does it on sound economic grounds, he will be rewarded by good results, whereas if he does it for reasons of apartheid, he will fail like the Government failed with border industries and with the establishment of industries in the homelands. The Government will then lose another 30 years, as it has lost 30 years to date. However, if the hon. the Minister does it on sound economic grounds, he will achieve results. There is good reason to decentralize. To quote from a speech made very recently by my predecessor, Dr. Zac de Beer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">70&#x0025; of all Asians, 60&#x0025; of all Whites, 50&#x0025; of all Coloureds and 25&#x0025; of all Africans in greater South Africa live in the four major metropolitan areas of the PWV area, the Durban-Pinetown area, the Cape Peninsula and the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage area. Together, these four complexes provide 65&#x0025; of the economic output, although occupying only 2&#x0025; of the land area.</block>

<p>Then he says a very interesting thing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The domination of the PWV area over all the others is very striking. It now accounts for 50&#x0025; of all industrial output and for over 60&#x0025; of all tertiary and service activities in the country. If present trends continue, it is forecast that by the year 2000 more than 50&#x0025; of all Whites in South Africa will live in the PWV region&#x2026;</block>

<p>That means that the PFP will have more than 50&#x0025; of the seats in the House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; while the greater Johannesburg metropolitan area has been forecast to increase its size from its present total population of 2,1 million to 8,5 million over this period.</block>

<p>Then he also indicates that over the past 30 years the total number of jobs created in the decentralized areas&#x2014;the requirements over the same period were to be measured in millions&#x2014;including Rosslyn, Silverton, Umlazi and all the areas close to the present urban areas, was little over 200 000. In other words, the Government has failed dismally to carry out its responsibility of creating jobs in the decentralized areas. The reason for that is simply the Government&#x2019;s penchant for trying to do this for apartheid reasons and not for sound economic reasons.</p>

<p>I want to warn the hon. the Minister that he is going to have to fight the members of his Cabinet and his Prime Minister, because I believe the Government is now absolutely determined to abuse the economy of South Africa to achieve its apartheid ends. In terms of the so-called new regional economic development, the Government has given notice that the White tax-payer is going to have to pay for this and that the existing established economic metropoles of South Africa will in fact have to be undermined in order to achieve the growth of the new regional economic areas. On 3 August the hon. the Prime Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the main metropolitan areas it will now be necessary to move very definitely towards coming as close as possible to fullcost allocation for all services and investments that are at present directly or indirectly subsidized, including transport, housing and other infrastructural services.</block>

<p>In other words, while by means of taxation most of the country&#x2019;s revenue is taken from the existing urban industrial complexes, the only return those areas get is through the subsidization of the infrastructural services such as housing, health services, etc. Now the Government says that in the future it is not going to return that money to those complexes although it is justly theirs, but is going to use that money in order to apply apartheid. The hon. the Prime Minister went further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are not likely to benefit much by positively encouraging regional development unless at the same time we also counteract the natural magnetic force of the bigger metropolitan areas by gradually <span class="col_397-398" refersTo="page_0214"/>switching from subsidized tariffs for services and facilities to full-cost allocations. Only in this way will our regional development strategy be able to evolve along meaningful economic lines.</block>

<p>I think it is necessary that the statement by the hon. the Prime Minister be analysed and understood and I think that this hon. Minister must understand what that statement means. That statement simply means that the Government cannot prevent economic development from taking place in the existing urban industrial complexes, and cannot force it to take place in the new areas demarcated in terms of the new regional economic development plan. The Government cannot do so unless it takes this very drastic action of in effect undermining the existing established urban industrial areas by stopping the existing subsidization of the infrastructure of those areas and using that money in order to develop the new areas demarcated for regional economic development. In other words, what the Government is going to do is to carry out its policy of apartheid by hook or by crook. It is going to do so by making the urban complexes pay for it and it is going to do so at the cost of the urban complexes, using their tax money and denying them what is rightfully theirs in terms of the return by way of the subsidies which they are getting at the present moment. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that, if the Government does that, it will find that it will not succeed in getting either the co-operation or the support of the vast majority of the people who can help it to bring about the economic development that is required. If it goes ahead, it is going to cause resentment, it is going to affect the morale of the industrialists of this country and in the final analysis it is going to fail once more; and I want to tell the Government that, if it fails once more, it will be its very last failure. The country cannot afford this sort of action any longer. I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister, with the position of influence he has and in view of the responsibility he has towards the economy of the country, to leave no stone unturned in an attempt to persuade the Cabinet not to carry out this threat to the industrial complexes of South Africa and not to attempt to achieve its apartheid ends in terms of purely ideological requirements and at the cost of the economic development and stability of our society.</p>

Dit is vir my interessant dat die agb. fid eintlik die aandag van sy eie beleid en van di&#x00E9; van sy party probeer aflei. Ek is bly dat die agb. lid vir Yeoville vanmiddag hier is, want dit is so dat hy voorsitter is van &#x2019;n komitee van ondersoek na die ekonomiese beleid van die Progressiewe Federale Party, wat kyk na hulle vooruitsigte in di&#x00E9; verband. Ek neem aan die agb. lid vir Bryanston is ook &#x2019;n lid van daardie komitee. Ek verstaan dat hulle nou al twee jaar aan die verslag werk, maar dat hulle nie tot &#x2019;n punt kan kom nie, want daar is klaarblyklik &#x2019;n botsing tussen die sosialiste en die kapitaliste in daardie party. Ons het nou die geleentheid, en ekstra tyd is nou beskikbaar, en dit sal interessant wees om van die agb. lid vir Bryanston of die agb. lid vir Yeoville te hoor hoe hulle ekonomiese beleid by hulle politieke beleid in Suid-Afrika gaan aanpas. Ek hoop dat dit in hierdie debat na vore sal kom.</p>

<p>Wat ook vir my duidelik is, mnr. die Voorsitter, is dat die beleidsinisiatiewe wat die Eerste Minister en die Kabinet neem, vir die amptelike Opposisie inderdaad &#x2019;n kopseer is. Die vordering wat in daardie verband gemaak word, bied al minder aan hulle die geleentheid om met hulle sieninge te slaag. Ons het nie, soos die agb. lid vir Bryanston nou die dag te kenne gegee het, vanwe&#x00EB; die getalle, ens., reeds oorgegee nie; die agb. lid vir Bryanston het eintlik klaar die handdoek ingegooi. Die Regering en ons aan hierdie kant het egter besluit om die uitdagings in Suid-Afrika te aanvaar. Ander agb. lede aan hierdie kant sal later ook verdere sake wat deur die agb. lid vir Bryanston geopper is, aanraak. Ek sal ook by enkele van die sake kom.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag aanvanklik die agb. Minister gelukwens en ook sterkte toewens met die bespreking van sy Begrotingspos. Dit is die eerste keer dat die agb. Minister hierdie Begrotingspos hanteer. Ek wil hierdie wense ook eweneens aan die agb. Adjunk-minister oordra. Die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister kan steeds reken op die heelhartige samewerking van agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad. Ek wil ook aan die Direkteur-generaal, dr. Du Plessis, en sy personeel s&#x00EA;: Baie dankie vir die samewerking wat ons as parlementari&#x00EB;rs steeds van hulle ontvang.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag met waardering verwys na die baie belangrike werk wat verskillende diensorganisasies in die handel en nywerheid verrig. Ek wil veral vanmiddag verwys na die Gefedereerde Kamer van Nywerhede, die Vereniging van Kamers van Koophandel, die Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, en na die belangrjke bydrae wat die amptelike orgaan van die Suid-Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut, die <i>Volkshandel</i>, in ons ekonomiese le we maak. Dit is &#x2019;n puik bydrae wat gelewer word. Ons en die lede van die Opposisiepartye wat lede is van hierdie bepaalde studiegroepe, kry jaarliks uitnodigings vir samesprekings en voorligting, en bepaalde aspekte van die ekonomie en die ekonomiese lewe word dan bespreek. Hierdie gereelde kennismaking en wisselwerking stel &#x2019;n klimaat daar vir begrip en toeligting van mekaar, en help meer dikwels ook om misverstande veral met betrekking tot uitgangspunte en die toepassing van, bv. wetgewing, uit die weg te ruim, soos onlangs tydens &#x2019;n bepaalde samespreking gebeur het.</p>

<p>Ek wil dan ook my waardering uitspreek teenoor die besture en lede van hierdie organisasies vir die wyse waarop hulle die ekonomie en die sakelui in Suid-Afrika dien, en vir die samewerking wat daar bestaan. Myns insiens kan die beraadslaging tussen hierdie organisasies en die bepaalde studiegroepe van die verskillende politieke partye, soos hier verteenwoordig, nog verder uitgebrei word. Die taak van hierdie organisasies, o.a. in verband met die ko&#x00F6;rdinasie van standpunte en die insette wat hulle lewer tot die uitbou van die ekonomiese aktiwiteite van Suid-Afrika, kan nie hoog genoeg geag word nie. Terselfdertyd moet ek ook ten opsigte van elke sakeman, nyweraar en ondernemer wat bereid is om die uitdagings en risiko&#x2019;s die hoof te bied, d&#x00EC;t s&#x00EA;: Ek gun graag die ondernemer sy wins, want hy het inderdaad groot risiko&#x2019;s. Die toekoms sal steeds groter eise stel aan die ekonomie en dus ook aan die ondernemer en die privaatsektor. Nieteenstaande die negatiewe standpunte wat die agb. lid vir Bryanston gestel het, het ons in Suid-Afrika uitstekende voorbeelde, van jaar tot jaar, van ondernemers wat bereid is om die uitdagings te aanvaar, en daardeur sukses te behaal en werkgeleent-hede te verskaf. As &#x2019;n mens byvoorbeeld in die <i>Financial Mail</i> van verlede Vrydag kyk na die aantal maatskappye wie se voorbelasbare wins en die persentasieverbete-rings daarop weergegee word, vind &#x2019;n mens syfers soos 20&#x0025;, 68&#x0025;, 48&#x0025;, 61&#x0025;, 69&#x0025;, 70&#x0025;, ens. Die maatskappye groei by die dag nieteenstaande die standpunte wat van Opposisiekant gestel word en nieteenstaande die voorspooksels wat hulle nou al in die weg wil l&#x00EA; om &#x2019;n eweredige verspreiding van die ekonomiese bedrywighede in Suid-Afrika daar te stel. Nieteenstaande daardie <span class="col_401-402" refersTo="page_0216"/>verdagmakingsproses, groei die ekonomie en groei die nyweraar, danksy die vermo&#x00EB;ns van die mense asook hul bereidheid om ter wille van ontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika, die nodige uitdagings en risiko&#x2019;s die hoof te bied.</p>

<p>Meneer, daar is twee vereistes vir ekonomiese ontwikkeling, nl. dat daar politieke stabiliteit en vrede moet wees. Hierdie Regering het oor die jare daarvoor gesorg, en die ekonomiese groei, wat in die eerste instansie in die hande van die privaatondernemer is, het onder hierdie Regering gedy.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek hoef nie vandag te betoog en te wys op die noodsaaklikheid van ekonomiese groei vir die behoorlike vervulling van die doelwit van &#x2019;n Suid-en Suider-Afrika waarin werklike vryheid en stoflike voorspoed tot die hoogste peil gevoer kan word, om sodoende almal se lewensgehalte en -standaarde te verbeter nie. Dit is die doel in Suid-Afrika, nl. om uiteindelik aan elke mens &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; lewensgehalte daar te stel. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston wil so graag die ideologiese beleid van hierdie kant van die Raad koppel aan sy ekonomiese beleid. Meneer, die prim&#x00EA;re oogmerk van ons in Suid-Afrika is om die mense in Suid-Afrika se lewensgehalte te verbeter, om ware vryheid vir almal daar te stel, en om &#x2019;n hoogstaande lewensgehalte te bewerkstellig. Wat hand aan hand gaan, is politieke stabiliteit en ekonomiese groei. Oor baie jare het die Regering sy kant in hierdie saak gebring, en het hy &#x2019;n klimaat geskep&#x2014;en hy gaan voort daarmee om op &#x2019;n ordelike wyse die situasie te bestendig, waarbinne die private ondernemer sy prim&#x00EA;re verantwoordelikheid kan nakom, nl. om te sorg vir ekonomiese groei. Die verklaarde beleid van die Regering is dat, in die eerste instansie, dit die taak is van die private ondernemer om te sorg vir ekonomiese groei. Waar dit die oogmerk is om met die oog op ekonomiese ontwikkeling &#x2019;n meer ewewigtige verspreiding van ekonomiese bedrywighede binne die RSA te verseker en om ekonomiese groei binne of naby onafhanklike Swart state en nasionale state te bevorder, wil ek vertrou dat daar volle samewerking van die privaatsektor sal wees om hierdie oogmerk te bereik, en sodoende mee te werk tot die bereiking van die doelwit van werklike vryheid en &#x2019;n verhoging van lewensgehalte en welvaart daar te stel. Ek wil vra dat die privaatsektor hom nie moet steur aan die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Bryanston vanmiddag nie, waarin hy nou reeds daardie voorgenome oogmerke onder verdenking probeer plaas het.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag s&#x00EA;, Meneer, dat ek van harte vertrou dat die nywerheid-en handels-organisasies hulle lede positief sal aanmoedig om hieraan mee te doen, op grond van ekonomiese oorwegings, want niemand verwag van &#x2019;n privaatondememing dat hy nie ten alle tye gesonde ekonomiese en finansi&#x00EB;le dissiplines in sy onderneming en by die oorweging van vestigingsfaktore in ag moet neem nie. Maar, Meneer, dit is ook belangrik dat by die oorweging van ekonomiese faktore, die oogmerk van ontwikkeling van Suid-en Suider-Afrika steeds in ag geneem moet word. Daarom wil ek die bewering verwerp wat die agb. lid vanmiddag gemaak het, toe hy ges&#x00EA; het dat ons bloot op ideologiese gronde &#x2019;n ewewigtige verspreiding wil h&#x00EA; &#x2026; [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#venter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. A. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. Whip.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag &#x2019;n verdere aangeleentheid aanraak. Vanaf die Staat se kant het die privaatsektor meer as ooit &#x2019;n besonder ywerige en doelgerigte vennoot vir die ekonomiese ontwikkeling van ons geweste, wat tot voordeel van die mense, maar ook tot voordeel van die ondernemer en die belegger moet wees. Ek wil graag vanmiddag op twee aspekte wys. As ons kyk na die verbruikersprysindeks en die verhoging in daardie indeks van tyd tot tyd, dan bly dit vir &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n bron van kommer. Die verbruiker betaal dieselfde vir &#x2019;n artikel, ongeag wat sy velkleur is. Terwyl vergoedingsverbeteringe altyd in aanvraag is en op die tafel is, enersyds vanwe&#x00EB; koste-stygings, en andersyds om lewensomstandighede te verbeter, is dit by my &#x2019;n ernstige vraag of die gereelde stygings nie die uiteindelike doelwit, soos ek dit gestel het, sal pootjie nie. Die indruk bestaan by die informele privaatsektor dat maatskappye groter en groter winste maak, en ek weet daar is geldige argumente wat die saak in perspektief stel, maar die algemene publiek wil baie maklik ook die kostestygings hieraan koppel. <span class="col_403-404" refersTo="page_0217"/>As die oorheersende indruk by die informele privaatsektor en by die algemene publiek moet ontwikkel dat die ekonomiese ontwikkeling, die vryemarkstelsel en die pri-vaatondememer se resultate vir hom as verbruiker voortdurende lewenskostestygings inhou, sodat sy lewensgehalte nie verbeter nie, of daardeur nie verbeter kan word nie, kan dit die Staat se taak &#x2019;n moeilik hanteerbare een maak. Ek is oortuig daarvan dat die privaatsektor in sy beroepsorganisasies en deur middel van sy diensliggame geko&#x00F6;rdineerd baie ernstige aandag aan hierdie aspek moet gee, want die ideaal bly steeds dat direkte inmenging van die Staat in die vryemarkmeganisme tot &#x2019;n minimum beperk moet word.</p>

<p>Die tweede aspek wat ek wil aanraak, is dat in die ekonomiese ontwikkeling en die vereiste groei, die openbare sektor se onontbeerlike rol in gedagte gehou moet word, en dat gevolg gegee moet kan word aan die vereiste wat die privaatsektor stel, dat die openbare sektor doeltreffend moet wees. Ons kan nie dankbaar genoeg wees vir die bekwame amptenaarskorps wat ons in Suid-Afrika het nie, maar daar is klaarblyklik &#x2019;n voortdurende uittog na die privaatsektor van di&#x00E9; arbeidskragte, en jy kan niemand kwalik neem, Meneer, as hy sy posisie kan of wil verbeter nie. Daar word ges&#x00EA; dat die privaatsektor die mense uit die openbare sektor koop. Om die doelwit te bereik, moet die openbare sektor se bekwame mannekrag nie gedreineer word nie. Ek is daarvan oortuig dat ook hier dit nodig geword het dat die privaatondernemer, deur middel van sy beroepsorganisasies en sy diensliggame, ernstig en positief sal besin om mee te werk en &#x2019;n werkswyse te vind wat hierdie probleem kan hanteer. Benewens die voordele wat die privaatsektor bekom van die Staat se opleiding, wat vir daardie sektor se voordeel gedoen is teen &#x2019;n koste wat op geen wyse op die private ondernemer afgewentel word nie, kan hierdie tendens &#x2019;n wanbalans daarstel wat die tydige bereiking van die mikpunte vir die ekonomiese ontwikkeling kan raak. Die private ondernemer bring oor &#x2019;n lang tydperk sy kant in Suid-Afrika, en veral waar daar bepaalde knelpunte bestaan, vanwe&#x00EB; sekere buitelandse vooroordele, het die kundigheid en vindingrykheid van die ondernemer en die nyweraar op sy beste na vore gekom. Daarom is ek daarvan oortuig dat ook die twee probleme wat ek gestel het, gehanteer sal kan word. Dit is &#x2019;n probleem wat normaalweg so maklik aan die deur van die Regering gel&#x00EA; word, maar eintlik moet dit dringend op die agenda van die privaatondernemer kom.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the second half-hour.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to congratulate three people this afternoon. It makes me feel rather like an old grand-daddy because I believe that of the chief spokesmen of the three parties, I am the only one that is an &#x201C;old boy&#x201D;. We also have a new Minister. On behalf of my party I should like to congratulate the Minister and wish him all of the very best, especially, as the hon. member for Bryanston said, in his forthcoming byelection. I should also like to congratulate the hon. member for Bryanston and the hon. member for Klerksdorp on attaining the positions they now hold, of being the chairmen of their groups.</p>

<p>Does this mean that your party is the most conservative of the lot?</p>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I shall not reply to that comment from the hon. member for Yeoville. I am going to try not to reply to his comments.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was rather pleased to hear what the hon. member for Klerksdorp had to say about the private sector and the need for them to accept their responsibilities in a free enterprise society. The contribution which I hope to make today is going to deal primarily with this. I am not going to enter into a debate on ideological grounds, although I must say that my party and I believe that it is only through economic prosperity that one can achieve the greatest degree of human liberation. I think it is basic for human dignity and self-respect that there should be economic growth and that the individual should have the opportunity to work and to enjoy the fruit of his work.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am quite sure that the hon. the Minister realizes the immense importance of his role as Minister of this particular department. I say this because he is the one who, with his department, has much to say as far as administered prices are concerned. <span class="col_405-406" refersTo="page_0218"/>He also administers the Competitions Board. He is further responsible for public corporations, and in fact, he is responsible for the South African economy. This places a tremendous responsibility on him. The question I should like to ask him today is: Just how well has the economy been managed in recent years, not only from the industrial and commercial point of view&#x2014;and here I am referring primarily to the large companies&#x2014;but also from the point of view of the small businessman and the consumer? I should like to submit&#x2014;and in this connection the hon. member for Klerksdorp referred to <i>The Financial Mail</i> and the results of companies&#x2019; earnings over recent years&#x2014;that our large industrial and commercial sectors have been doing extremely well, but I doubt whether one can say the same for the small businessman and for the consumer. I believe that these two latter groups of people have been losing out over the last year, mainly due to the toll which inflation has been taking in our economy. Inflation, we know, stifles growth. We know that it places a certain restriction on the growth of employment. As far as the consumer is concerned, it certainly erodes his purchasing power. I should like to refer once again to a press report to which I referred during the Budget debate, in which we are told what Dr. Jan Marais had to say about inflation. According to this report in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 26 July this year, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A man puts relatively good money into the monetary system, but the money he gets back is bad because even with interest he is not able to buy the same amount of goods as before. The value of his money has been eroded and this is the &#x201C;theft&#x201D; I was talking about.</block>

<p>The article goes on to say that the bank economist, Dr. Johan Cloete, agreed with this, and had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Businessmen also want an increase, so they put up prices and in some respects this suits the Government because increased profits mean increased taxes. And it is these very people who cause inflation who are able to protect themselves when the economy dips through the excesses made in the good times. The rich man can protect his money by investing in assets which are indexed to inflation like certain shares and gold, but the wage and salary earner is not protected and inflation eats away at his savings and pension.</block>

<p>That is a very true statement and in this regard I should like to refer hon. members to the <i>Statistical/Economic Review</i> for 1981-&#x2019;82, which was issued at the time of the budget speech. In this document one finds statistics which show that the gross operating surplus in the private business sector rose in the last year by 50,7&#x0025;. In money terms this represents R8 254 million. For the first time in many years the operating surplus of companies exceeded the salaries and wages paid to employees in the private sector. One finds that personal savings during the same period actually dropped by 7&#x0025;. In other words, they dropped by some R594 million. It is because of this that one finds, as was stated in one of the week-end newspapers as recently as this last weekend, that many people today are being pressed by the people who gave them credit, and that they are in trouble. This is the point I want to put to the hon. the Minister who, as I have said, is the Minister responsible for our economic affairs: Exactly how well has the economy operated in the interests of all? The question is, Sir: Can inflation be beaten? One goes back to the Minister of Finance&#x2019;s budget speech of last year. In column 352 of <i>Hansard</i> of Wednesday, 26 March 1980, he listed six ways of combating inflation. The first was one which he is now actively working on, namely the control of the money supply. The second one, which we are also working on, is the better utilization of labour and the training of labour, as the hon. member for Klerksdorp has mentioned. The third one was to allow the commercial rand to float upwards to a degree, which has been happening. The fourth one was that there should be no artificial impediments in the way of imports. As we know, there has been a high level of imports in recent times. The fifth one, which I am going to deal with, was that action should be taken against any form of monopolistic exploitation of the public. The sixth one was that in the areas of administered prices, especially relating to electricity and railway tariffs, there should be strict discipline. I was <span class="col_407-408" refersTo="page_0219"/>pleased to see that postal and telephone tariffs were not raised, which shows that the Government is doing something about that.</p>

<p>It is the fifth point I want to concentrate on this afternoon, namely that monopolistic tendencies should be controlled. The question I want to ask the hon. the Minister is: Is there any exploitation by monopolies or big business in South Africa today? People may say that this is not the case, but I have been watching this for the last six or eight months, and I am going to quote briefly from some reports to illustrate my point. A headline in <i>The Argus</i> of 17 January reads: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a rip-off, say crayfish catchers.&#x201D; I quote from this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While fresh and frozen crayfish are fetching up to R25 in French and American restaurants, the Coloured people who pull them out are being paid as little as 6 cents a crayfish.</block>

<p>So, Sir, one can ask whether there is any monopolistic exploitation in that area. A headline in the <i>Daily News</i> of 3 February states: &#x201C;Bitter blow as beer price rockets.&#x201D; Here, Sir, we had S.A. Breweries taking over Continental Breweries, I think it was, at the time. It was thought that this was going to result in rationalization, which one would imagine would have improved efficiency and would result in economies, but we find that despite these things, prices still rocket. The question is: Is there a monopoly in the liquor trade? Then, Sir, we find an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 25 January, under the headline &#x201C;We want protection.&#x201D; This has to do with home appliances, and it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Barlows Manufacturing Company, the country&#x2019;s leading washing machine manufacturer, applied earlier this month for an increase in the customs duty on washing machines of 25&#x0025; to 40&#x0025;.</block>

<p>Then the article goes further to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite the buoyancy of the local market (sales rose by 30&#x0025;-40&#x0025; last year) most manufacturers could raise production further. They are also looking ahead to the next down-turn. Ted Ashdown of Hoover says: &#x201C;It is all very well to be complacent, but none of us are up to 100&#x0025; of capacity.&#x201D; Hoover, for example, is still working only one shift. Adds Williams: &#x201C;The last few months have been records for everyone. But it can&#x2019;t continue at this level.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Now, Mr. Chairman, here we find an industry which is operating at record production level, which one would imagine would result in economies and efficiency, and in bigger profits, but here they are calling for protection. One wonders whether it is not possibly a little more competition that they should be concentrating on, rather than protection. The excuse that is given is that there is &#x201C;dumping&#x201D; of goods from overseas manufacturing concerns. One finds something similar according to an article in <i>The Citizen</i> of earlier this year&#x2014;I do not have the exact date. Under the heading &#x201C;Plastic gets protection&#x201D;, we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Tariff protection for the South African plastic industry has been granted by the Government &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here again we find the complaint about dumping, but on the same page of this Business Section of <i>The Citizen</i>, we find the headline &#x201C;Triomf and Oxy get together&#x201D;. The companies referred to here are the Triomf Fertilizer Company and Occidental Petroleum. Then, in <i>The Financial Mail</i> of 13 February, we find the headline &#x201C;A cartel looms&#x201D;. I quote from the article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The joint marketing venture between Louis Luyt&#x2019;s Triomf Fertilizer Group and Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) goes far beyond what has been announced. It includes participation in an international cartel to control the world&#x2019;s production (and hence price) of phosphoric acid &#x2026; Between them, Triomf and Oxy control about 65&#x0025; of world supplies &#x2026; Luyt (although he refuses to discuss cartels) says &#x201C;Once the embargo is lifted I will be making so much money I won&#x2019;t know what to do with it.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir, I put it to the hon. the Minister: On the one hand big industry is saying &#x201C;We need protection because of the dumping&#x201D;, and yet, on the other, we find in our chemicals <span class="col_409-410" refersTo="page_0220"/>industry that South African companies are becoming part of world-wide cartels. One wonders just how much protection big business requires. And then, on 1 February 1981, <i>The Sunday Times</i> had this to say in a headline: &#x201C;Greed &#x2018;root cause&#x2019; of inflation.&#x201D; I should like to quote a portion of this article for the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s interest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Greed is the root cause of inflation and unless businessmen change their thinking it cannot be brought under control,&#x201D; says Prof. Jan Sadie, head of the University of Stellenbosch&#x2019;s Bureau for Economic Research.</block>

<p>I put this question to the hon. the Minister: What is really the cause of inflation? Is it greed? Are big business manufacturing companies making a valid request when they call for protection, or is it that they are afraid of competition? I think the hon. the Minister, as the Minister who looks after the Competitions Board, should tell us to what extent his department and the Competitions Board are investigating this matter and what progress they are making in this direction. I believe that South Africa needs more competition. I believe that a lot of our industrialists and businessmen are afraid of competition. In this article to which I have referred, Prof. Jan Sadie went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Businessmen have become slack in today&#x2019;s economic climate as it is so easy to increase prices. There is far too little competition in the market-place from a price point of view. The only competition is for market share by means of advertising.</block>

<p>I could go further along these lines, but I intend to concentrate on just one particular industry now, and that is the building industry.</p>

<p>We find, Sir, that building costs have risen over the period October 1979 to October 1980 by 32,3&#x0025;. It is estimated that from October last year to October this year they will increase by between 20&#x0025; and 25&#x0025;. These are figures which are issued by the Building Industries Federation of South Africa. The question that one must ask is: Are the increases in the prices of building materials really legitimate? [Interjections.] A lot of these supplies are controlled by Government. The prices of bricks, cement, or any of these things, are administered prices, and the whole point I am endeavouring to make is that we should possibly have another look at this matter.</p>

<p>Are you arguing against control now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>I am suggesting to the hon. the Minister that when you create controls, big business manipulate those controls in their own interests, and I intend showing this, if hon. members will give me time. Are the increases in the prices of building material due to demand inflation? I have said that Bifsa have pointed out that prices are increasing at a certain rate, but if one studies the Bureau for Economic Research&#x2019;s report of January 1981, on page A14, one finds a graph showing the value of building plans passed at constant 1970 prices. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister and his department to study this. If one studies this graph one finds that in August 1980 the volume of buildings erected in money terms at constant 1980 prices was no higher than in October 1974. Therefore, all the talk and publicity about there being such a great building boom that has resulted in sky-rocketting prices, I question. This is borne out by the report of the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch. In the <i>Daily News</i> of 5 September 1981 one finds an article under the heading &#x201C;Growth rate still negative&#x201D;. This comes from BIFSA itself. I quote from the article, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The building industry growth rate for 1980 was not as spectacular as expected and amounted to only 4,4&#x0025;, according to Hennie van Zyl, economist for the Building Industries Federation (S.A.).</block>

<p>If this is the case, why the shortage of building materials? The question I should like to <span class="col_411-412" refersTo="page_0221"/>ask is: Is it because the monopolies which are controlling building materials are controlling the market? I, therefore, ask the hon. the Minister to consider these questions I am asking. Let us take a look at, for instance, bricks. I want to ask the hon. the Minister why there is a brick shortage in South Africa today.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Because there are not enough bricks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville says there are not enough bricks. I want to know why there are not enough bricks. If South Africa could have sustained the building growth in 1974 with existing building-brick plants, why can it not be done today? The hon. the Minister may well say that there are not enough bricks, but I should like to know why there are not enough bricks.</p>

<p>In the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 5 September 1981 there appears another report under the heading &#x201C;Natal brick shortage worse&#x201D;. This is despite the fact that activities in the building industry are starting to decline. The report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The brick shortage in Natal is worse than it was a year ago.</block>

<p>It goes on to say that a spokesman of one of the biggest brick manufacturers in South Africa says that the brick industry was not prepared for the 1980 boom. The gentleman went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The brick industry is price-controlled and our investment is limited according to the return we are allowed. It would have seemed ridiculous to have asked for finance for huge factories, nowadays costing between R10 million and R14 million, at the time during the recession in 1978 when we had eight factories shut and 300 million bricks eroding our financial resources.</block>

<p>This is the point I want to make. In 1978 there were 300 million bricks in stockpile. Two years later we have a shortage. According to a report in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 26 July 1981 Britain had a stockpile of 1 152 million bricks, four times the number of bricks we had in stockpile in South Africa. This would be enough to build 100 000 three-bedroomed detached houses. If we had 300 000 bricks in stockpile in 1978, how many houses have we built with those bricks?</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Where have all the bricks gone?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bartlett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>This is the question. We can laugh about this, but I should like to ask a question about this of the hon. the Minister. What was South Africa&#x2019;s annual brick-manufacturing capacity for each year from 1975 to 1981? Has it increased? Did it decline at a certain time? Here is another question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister. Later on in this debate one of my colleagues will explain the difficulties which an entrepreneur had tried to establish a brick factory and how he was blocked by Government. If he had established his brick factory it may be that we would have had more bricks at a lower price. The question I should like to put to the hon. the Minister is whether the giants have bought out smaller manufacturers, closed them down and then wrote into their costs, because it is an administered price, the capital cost of closing down that brick-making capacity? This is a very important question which I believe the hon. the Minister should reply to.</p>

<p>The fact is that where you have price control&#x2014;this is the point I should like to make&#x2014;the businesses concerned can manipulate the market to the extent that they can buy out smaller competitors, close them down, write into their own costs the capital cost of closing down that production capacity and then ask for a rise in the price of bricks. In so doing they enjoy a monopoly. I am just asking questions and the hon. the Minister should reply to them. I also want to ask the hon. the Minister how the Competition Board works. Has it looked into these matters? The hon. the Minister of Finance said last year that he was very much in favour of the creation of small businesses because they could create jobs at a lower cost. I believe that we have to try and open a way for more competition and more and more businesses operating.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston quoted <span class="col_413-414" refersTo="page_0222"/>an article which I also plan to quote. The article appeared in the <i>Business Argus</i> of 1 September 1981 under the heading &#x201C;Small businesses &#x2018;destroyed&#x2019; by laws&#x201D;. I think the hon. member made a very valid point. The article reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government has done more to destroy small business than any other organization although not purposely, says Mr. A. van Heerden, public relations officer of the Development and Finance Corporation.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bryanston said that the Government was doing this deliberately, but the article says &#x201C;not purposely&#x201D;. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister that we have to look at this in South Africa today. We have to look at our economy with a view to ensuring that there is sufficient competition to ensure that the consumer gets a square deal. If we cannot have competition in South Africa, the alternative left open to us is to allow imports so that there can be competition. As I have indicated this afternoon, you will find that once that happens you get squeals from a broad section of industry, from plastics manufacturers to home appliance manufacturers.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should just like to say that we in this party believe in competition.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Well, yes, although I realize that imports as part of the competition I would like to see will have effects on our balance of payments. I understand all that. However, as I said right at the start of my speech, this hon. Minister has a tremendous task. I do believe that if we want to become a country with a truly free enterprise economy there will have to be a greater concentration on ensuring that there is sufficient competition.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Amanzimtoti sal my verskoon as ek nie pertinent op sy toespraak reageer nie. Hy sal in die loop van my betoog uitvind dat ek in die meeste gevalle met hom verskil en partykere amper met hom saamstem. Ek wil egter net verwys na &#x2019;n punt wat sowel die agb. lid as die agb. lid vir Bryanston gemaak het waar hulle verwys het na die vermoor van die klein sakeman deur die Regering en wel, soos die agb. lid vir Bryanston dit gestel het, doelbewus, of, soos die agb. lid vir Amanzimtoti dit gestel het, nie doelbewus nie. Ek wil dit verwerp met die feite wat daarteen spreek. As ons kyk na die verskillende reaksies op die groei van die klein sakeman, sien ons dat daar in, byvoorbeeld, <i>Tegniek</i> van Maart 1981 ges&#x00EA; word dat die klein sakeman &#x2019;n blink toekoms in Suid-Afrika het. Ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die klein sakeman in Suid-Afrika het &#x2019;n blink toekoms en alles gaan afhang van wat hy self daarvan maak. Al lyk dit op die oog of groepvorming in die sakew&#x00EA;reld eerder toe-as afneem, is daar volop geleenthede wat benut kan word.</block>

<p>Voorts word daar vertel hoedat die Regering besig is om hierdie aangeleentheid te ondersteun. Ons is bewus van die ko&#x00F6;perasie, ons is bewus van al die feite, ons is bewus van die Regering se erns met hierdie saak en gevolglik dink ek die feite spreek teen die stellings wat di&#x00E9; twee agb. lede gemaak het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het gepraat van die gemors wat die Regering dan nou sou gemaak het van die ekonomie van Suid-Afrika. In hierdie verband wil ek verwys na &#x2019;n kwartaallikse oorsig oor die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie uitgereik deur Nedbank Beperk (Geregistreerde Handelsbank), Volume 14, No. 3, November 1980. Hierdie organisasie het natuurlik geen rede om liefde vir die Regering te openbaar nie, maar ek glo hy sal &#x2019;n objektiewe stelling oor &#x2019;n aangeleentheid maak as dit geregverdig is. In di&#x00E9; kwartaallikse oorsig vind &#x2019;n mens die volgende stellings: &#x201C;Kleinhandelsverkope toon &#x2019;n stygende neiging&#x201D;, &#x201C;Motorverkope stuur op &#x2019;n nuwe rekord af&#x2019;, &#x201C;Die bou van huise floreer&#x201D;. So kan &#x2019;n mens aangaan. Ten spyte van di&#x00E9; soort verslae, kom daardie agb. lid met stellings wat heeltemal teen die feite spreek. Die ongeluk met daardie agb. lid is dat hy nie nou die dag die agb. lid vir Yeoville se toespraak gelees het nie. As &#x2019;n mens nou sy toespraak met di&#x00E9; van die agb. lid vir Yeoville vergelyk, vind &#x2019;n mens dat die een heeltemal in teenstelling met die ander een is. Daarom wonder &#x2019;n mens of die agb. lid vir Bryanston hom nie by gesondheidsake <span class="col_415-416" refersTo="page_0223"/>moes bly bepaal het nie in stede daarvan om hom op die gebied van die ekonomie te begewe. Siende dat dit sy eerste jaar is dat hy aan hierdie debat deelneem, wil ek hom egter baie hartlik gelukwens met sy voorsitterskap en hom &#x2019;n beter toekoms toewens as sy poging in hierdie debat vanjaar.</p>

<p>Ek wil eerstens aan die agb. Minister baie dankie s&#x00EA; vir iets wat hy aangekondig het.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that a State Award for Export Achievement had been introduced at the request of the private sector. It was also stated that the closing date for submissions in this regard was 30 June 1981. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister what has transpired in this regard. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that we appreciate that this step has been taken. I should also like to advocate in this regard that this award should not be given in one particular case, but that it should be extended and that the award should be made in, say, four or five centres in South Africa in order to motivate people. It should not only be awarded to one person in South Africa, but it should be extended to motivate people on a group basis.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag van die geleentheid gebruik maak om te verwys na een verdere aangeleentheid waarna die agb. lid vir Bryanston verwys het. Die agb. lid het onder andere gepraat van totale staatsinmenging. Ek wil vir hom s&#x00EA; dat daar outoriteite is wat meer kennis oor hierdie aangeleentheid het as hy, wat &#x2019;n heeltemal teenstellende opinie daaroor uitspreek. In hierdie verband wil ek dr. Max Thurn, sekretaris van een van die w&#x00EA;reld se leidende ekonomiese instellings, Mont Pellerin Society, ges&#x00EA; het. &#x2019;n SAPA-berig hieroor lui onder andere soos volg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa was generally much more economically free than country was given credit, secretary of one of world&#x2019;s elite economic societies, Dr. Max Thurn, of Mont Pellerin Society, said in Johannesburg on 1980.3.21.</block>

<p>This goes to show that the Government gets much more credit from people who can be regarded as experts than that hon. member is prepared to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag na &#x2019;n spesifieke aangeleent heid terugkom en verwys na Wes-Kaapland. Ek gaan dit hierdie sitting miskien nog tot vervelens toe doen, maar ek dink dit is nodig dat iemand &#x2019;n slag oor hierdie aangeleentheid praat en die spesifieke probleem van Wes-Kaapland aan die agb. Minister uitlig. Ek wil in die eerste instansie die stelling maak dat die samestelling van WesKaapland heeltemal uniek is. Gevolglik is &#x2019;n mens verplig om na die ekonomiese samestelling van Wes-Kaapland op sy eie te kyk. Terwyl ons basies met Derde W&#x00EA;reld- probleme sit asook met een van die hoogste bevolkingsontploffings, het ons aan die ander kant nie die ontwikkelde nywerheids-potensiaal wat die P.W.V.-en ander gebiede het nie. Ons het ook te doen met &#x2019;n paar ander situasies. In Wes-Kaapland is ons byvoorbeeld swakker af wat betref groei as die res van die Republiek en wel in so &#x2019;n mate dat ons sedert 1970 13&#x0025; agtergeraak het by die groei van die res van die land. Tweedens is die groeiende oorhoofse koste van plaaslike owerhede se dienste &#x2019;n al groterwordende probleem wat ons in hierdie gebied ondervind. Derdens het ons die gebrek aan water. Terwyl ek van water praat, wil ek s&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n mens seker moet erken dat die water wat in die Wes-Kaap ter beskikking van die nywerhede en die landbou is, relatief gesproke duurder is as die water vir nywerheids-en landboudoeleindes in enige ander gebied in die land omdat die bronne wat nou ontgin word nuwe bronne is en nie vergelyk kan word met die ou skemas wat in ander dele van die land in bedryf is nie. Daar is nog ander faktore soos elektrisiteit, wat plus-minus 30&#x0025; duurder in die Wes-Kaap is as in die res van die land. Vanwe&#x00EB; die groot afstande wat afgel&#x00EA; moet word, is spoorvrag ook nog &#x2019;n groot kostefaktor. Wes-Kaapland is dus in &#x2019;n unieke situasie en ek glo die gebied moet spesiale hulp kry. As ek van hulp praat, vra ek nie subsidies nie, want subsidies sal nie &#x2019;n oplossing vir ons probleme wees nie. Daar is agb. lede aan hierdie kant wat dankbaar is vir eenmalige bedrae wat in krisissituasies toegestaan is om hulle deur te help, maar die oplossing l&#x00EA; nie daarin nie. Ek glo dat ons met &#x2019;n langtermynbeplanningsaksie moet kom om hierdie gebied te help sodat die gebied homself kan help.</p>

<p>In hierdie verband wil ek vandag my gelukwensing bring aan die Burgemeester <span class="col_417-418" refersTo="page_0224"/>van Kaapstad, mnr. Louis Kreiner, met die stigting van Westgro. Met hierdie aksie word daar beplan om elke jaar ten minste R100 000 te begroot om die Wes-Kaap te help en sy ontwikkelingsmoontlikhede te propageer. Ek wil pleit dat in samewerking daarmee die agb. Minister dit moet oorweeg om &#x2019;n streeksontwikkelingsadvieskomitee daar te stel. Ek wil net meld dat wanneer ek vir die daarstelling van so &#x2019;n streeksontwikkelingsadvieskomitee op permanente grondslag vra, so &#x2019;n komitee op sy eie sal opereer in samewerking met Westgro en ander instellings. Ek wil ook net meld dat ingevolge Wet 88 van 1967 die Minister van Beplanning en die Omgewing, soos hy destyds bekend was, by magte is om so &#x2019;n advieskomitee te kan instel. Ek is seker dat die agb. Minister van Nywerheidswese, Handel en Toerisme die agb. Minister van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring sal kan oorreed om daardie magte van horn te gebruik.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HEYNS</person>:</from>

<p>Nee, my siening is dat &#x2019;n advieskomitee deur die Minister ingestel op sy eie moet kan opereer omdat daar wesenlike faktore is wat dit noodsaaklik maak dat die individualiteit van die twee instansies apart gehou word hoewel hulle saamwerk. Ek dink die punt wat daardie agb. lid in gedagte het, is dat as dit een liggaam is daar miskien op oorhoofse koste bespaar kan word. Dit is dalk so, maar aan die ander kant kan &#x2019;n mens heelwat probleme kry as die twee saam opereer. Laat ek een voorbeeld noem. Wanneer daar byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n werwingsveldtog deur Wesgro in die buiteland van stapel laat loop word, sal dit miskien beter wees as dit daar as &#x2019;n privaat-instelling en nie as &#x2019;n staatsondersteunde instelling opereer nie. Dit is maar net een faktor, maar daar is heelwaarskynlik &#x2019;n hele aantal faktore wat sake kan bemoeilik as daar net een liggaam is.</p>

<p>Wat die Wes-Kaap betref, glo ek, het ons &#x2019;n paar voordele. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. H. MEIRING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil die agb. lid vir Vasco bedank vir sy bydrae in verband met Wes-Kaapland. Ek het geen twyfel nie dat Wes-Kaapland al die potensiaal het om wonderlik te ontwikkel, maar een ding moet &#x2019;n mens aanvaar en dit is dat Wes-Kaapland &#x2019;n mark het wat in die verhouding R5 tot R17 staan in vergelyking met die mark van byvoorbeeld die P.W.V.-gebied. Daar is egter soveel ander moontlikhede wat in Wes-Kaapland ontwikkel kan word.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanmiddag baie graag na een klein voorbeeld verwys van iets wat in Wes-Kaapland ge&#x00EF;nisieer is en wat na my mening uiteindelik &#x2019;n baie groot voordeel vir arbeidstabiliteit in ons land kan h&#x00EA;. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het vanmiddag verwys na die noodsaaklikheid van &#x2019;n &#x201C;peaceful society&#x201D; en die bydrae wat produktiwiteit in di&#x00E9; verband kan maak. Ek dink nie enigiemand kan met hom op daardie punt verskil nie. Ek wil juis vanmiddag oor &#x2019;n saak praat wat dit vir ons moontlik sal maak.</p>

<p>In die bespreking van arbeidswetgewing vroe&#x00EB;r in hierdie sitting en spesiflek ook die Pos Mannekrag, is daar baie klem gel&#x00EA; op die noodsaaklikheid van gesonde verhoudings tussen werkgewer en werknemer. In die praktyk is dit gewoonlik baie gou duidelik in watter organisasies daar so &#x2019;n goeie verhouding bestaan. Waar in die vorige besprekings die soeklig elke keer op die werknemer geval het, val dit in die bespreking van hierdie Pos spesiflek op die werkgewer, die entrepreneur, die nyweraar of sakeman wat op sy beurt net so afhanklik is van sy werkerskorps en wat alleen suksesvol sal wees as daar die nodige onderlinge vertroue en gesonde menseverhoudings tussen werkgewer en werknemer bestaan. Dit is interessant dat oor &#x2019;n tydperk van byna 90 jaar die kerke spesifieke aandag gegee het aan die geestelike bearbeiding van die plus-minus 230 000 Blanke en nie-Blanke werknemers van die Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwe&#x00EB; en ook van die duisende seelui wat jaarliks ons kuste aandoen.</p>

<p>Daar het egter nou &#x2019;n nuwe ontwikkeling gekom wat juis hier in Wes-Kaapland ge&#x00EF;ni-sieer is en wat na my mening juis onder hierdie spesifieke Pos, naamlik Nywerheidswese, Handel en Toerisme, vermelding verdien. Ek verwys na die geestelike bearbeiding wat spesiflek op die privaatsektor gerig is en wat as nywerheidsbediening bekendstaan. Dit is hier in Wes-Kaapland ge&#x00EF;nisieer en het in &#x2019;n kort tyd besondere resultate in veral Wes-Kaapland gelewer. Nadat die N.G. Kerk die <span class="col_419-420" refersTo="page_0225"/>inisiatief geneem het, het verskillende kerke wat besef het watter geweldige invloed die moderne werksituasie op mense het en watter ho&#x00EB; eise dit aan mense stel, die nood-saaklikheid daarvan gesien om juis daardie mense in werkverband as &#x201E;volle&#x201D; mense te konfronteer. In die tyd waarin ons leef en waarin die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie moet groei en bloei om meer werksgeleenthede te skep vir &#x2019;n groeiende bevolking, het mense, d.w.s. werknemers en werkgewers, al meer materialisties, selfsugtig en gejaagd geword. Dit is so dat die mens van die Sondag nie die mens van die weekdag en van sy werksituasie is nie. Ek het geen twyfel nie dat juis dit dikwels basies die rede is vir swak werksver-houdinge.</p>

<p>Hierdie nywerheidsbedieningsaksie waarna ek verwys, se hoofdoelstelling is juis daarop ingestel om mense te motiveer om hulle dagtaak na die beste van hulle vermo&#x00EB; en tot eer van God te doen. Daar word gepoog om &#x2019;n gesonde en positiewe gees by werknemers in die werkplek te skep en talie bewyse is gelewer dat as gevolg hiervan arbeidsvrede geskep is en arbeidsonrus voorkom is. Daarmee saam was daar &#x2019;n verbasende verbetering in produktiwiteit van mense.</p>

<p>Ek het min twyfel dat met &#x2019;n gesonde Christelike ekonomie die magte van die Bose, insluitend die kommunisme, beveg en die toekoms van ons nageslag en ons land verseker kan word.</p>

<p>In Wes-Kaapland waar hierdie aksie ge&#x00EF;ni-sieer is, word nywerheidsbediening vandag by sowat 340 firmas en ondernemings gedoen. Dit word op &#x2019;n interkerklike basis gedoen om soveel werknemers en werkgewers as moontlik te probeer bereik. Ek was al dikwels persoonlik teenwoordig by byeen-komste van hierdie aard. Ek kan agb. lede verseker dat dit &#x2019;n belewenis is om te sien hoedat werknemers en werkgewers, Blank en nie-Blank, 20 minute lank saam in hul werksituasie met die Woord van God gekon-fronteer word. Die resultate is verstommend. Vir daardie paar oomblikke is almal gelyk, ongeag of dit die hoofbestuurder, &#x2019;n bode of &#x2019;n fabriekswerker is&#x2014;almal verkeer in dieselfde omstandighede. By daardie maatskappye en organisasies waar nywerheidsbediening aktief toegepas word, kry &#x2019;n mens die volgende resultate: (1) Die Christelike karakter en eervolle naam van die onderneming word bevestig en uitgebou; (2) die onderneming word gehelp om volgens Christelike beginsels te funksioneer; (3) elke werknemer word gehelp om &#x2019;n volwasse en goed aangepaste volle mens in die werkplek te wees; (4) werknemers word gehelp om hulle talente vertikaal en horisontaal reg aan te wend, waardeur arbeidsvreugde dan verkry word; (5) werknemers word gemoti-veer om doeltreffendheid van prestasie sover as moontlik te bevorder; (6) gesonde werks-verhoudinge word gekweek en &#x2019;n besondere spangees bestaan in daardie organisasies; (7) alle Christelike deugde soos eerlikheid, getrouheid, arbeidsaamheid, ens word bevorder; en (8) die veiligheidsmaatre&#x00EB;ls in die betrokke onderneming word aansienlik verbeter.</p>

<p>Daar is besondere vrug op hierdie poging in Wes-Kaapse nywerhede. Ons kan oor baie ander metodes gesels, maar ek glo dat as hierdie aksie spesifiek, doeltreffend en met entoesiasme in nywerhede dwarsdeur die land aangepak word, dit &#x2019;n wonderlike effek sal h&#x00EA;. Dit word onteenseglik bewys deur die getuienis van eienaars, van voormanne, van werkgewers en van werknemers. Waar dit gedoen word, verander die gees en die atmosfeer binne-in daardie organisasie dramaties. Daar kom samewerking, daar kom spanwerk, daar kom verhoogde doeltreffendheid, en personeel probleme word verminder en verdwyn uiteindelik. Die interessante is dat met die arbeidsonrus van &#x2019;n jaar gelede, di&#x00E9; organisasies waar nywerheidsbediening aktief gedoen word, verbasende arbeidsrus ondervind het. Die belang-rikste is miskien dat mense wat spesifiek by nywerheidsbediening betrek word, hulle werk begin geniet en dat hulle arbeidsvreugde kry.</p>

<p>It is amazing that where this action takes place, it becomes true what the famous Kalil Gibran once wrote. He wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Work is love made visible, and if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy, for if you bake bread with indifference you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half Man&#x2019;s hunger, and if you grudge the <span class="col_421-422" refersTo="page_0226"/>crushing of the grapes your grudge distils a poison in the wine.</block>

<p>Die nywerheid word dikwels versinnebeeld met yster ratte wat inmekaar draai. Spreuke 27:17 s&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yster slyp yster, so slyp die een mens die persoon van die ander.</block>

<p>Die agb. Minister weet dit natuurlik goed. In die handel en nywerheidswese waar die mens so belangrik is, maar waar die werknemer dikwels net &#x2019;n nommer geword het, rus daar &#x2019;n verpligting op almal, ook op hierdie departement, om van die werker &#x2019;n volle mens te maak. Dit is die belangrike bydrae wat nywerheidsbediening maak&#x2014;en die resultaat is verstommend. Ons s&#x00EA; graag dat ons in &#x2019;n land woon wat op Christelike fondamente gebou is, maar daardie Christelike beginsels moet ook in die sake-en die nywerheidslewe ingedra word.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag &#x2019;n beroep op ons land se nyweraars en sakeleiers doen dat hulle van hierdie aksie gebruik sal maak en sodoende mee te werk om arbeidsvrede in ons land te help verseker. Dit is nie net die taak van die kerk en die predikant nie, maar ook die werkgewer in Suid-Afrika se nywerhede en sakelewe het &#x2019;n uiters belangrike rol om te speel en &#x2019;n funksie om te vervul. As ons dit doen, sal ons presies kry wat die agb. lid vir Bryanston voor gepleit het, naamlik &#x2019;n &#x201E;peaceful society&#x201D;. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Paarl has made a very interesting speech on a subject which he clearly knows a lot about. It is not my intention to follow him, but I cannot, I am afraid, resist the comment that we appear to be moving from Christian National Education to Christian National Industries and Commerce in terms of the ideas of that hon. member.</p>

<p>There is a basic fallacy in the policies and the plans of this Government which I want to refer to today. The hon. member for Bryanston has in fact already referred to this fallacy, which is in its very principles and in its 12-point plan. This fallacy is nowhere more clear than in the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism. The question that I pose is whether it is possible for a free enterprise system to exist in a society which legislates for racial discrimination? Is it truly free enterprise when we deny a number of important aspects of that free enterprise system to a lesser privileged section of the community? Is it free enterprise to deny a group the right to seek work anywhere within the system? Let us ask the two hon. members sitting over there who were formerly members of the United Party &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; whether it is free enterprise to deny the people the right to seek work anywhere within the system. [Interjections.] I am still in opposition, unlike those members who joined up with the winning group. Secondly, is it free enterprise to deny a group the right to carry out certain categories of work? Let me refer to the fact that State tender documents still specify that the work must be carried out by a certain group of people. The tender documents specify what classes of people in terms of colour may carry out certain work.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Mr. Chairman, is it right to deny people the right to site their businesses in the prime business areas? Is that free enterprise? Fourthly, is it correct to deny the same people the right to become managers for White-owned businesses in certain circumstances? Fifthly, is it right to refuse to people the right to own a house in all the areas where the greatest number of job opportunities exist?</p>

<p>We do all these things and then we express shock and surprise and horror when the underprivileged in this country, underprivileged people by law, look to alternative systems other than the free enterprise system. Can we wonder that the Blacks, Coloureds and Indians look upon free enterprise as a tool of apartheid? I believe we have to make up our minds. We can have apartheid or we can have free enterprise. We cannot have both. This Government appears to believe that we can make progress in fields of economic endeavour and manpower utilization, and let us acknowledge that some progress has been made, and yet we allow limited or no participation in the political <span class="col_423-424" refersTo="page_0227"/>sphere. There is a second question I would like to ask the hon. Minister. Can we have economic reform without political reform? I believe it is impossible.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the hon. Prime Minister and his Carlton conference. He has this great big conference in Johannesburg and placed the spotlight in no uncertain terms on the free enterprise system in this country. He encouraged a tremendous feeling of optimism among the business leaders. He asked them for their co-operation and for fuller participation in the development of the country. In a month or two we are having a follow-up meeting. It is going to be held in Cape Town. I believe the business leaders should attend that meeting. There are people who have said they should not, but I think they should go to that meeting. We don&#x2019;t want to leave it to the Basil Landaus&#x2019; of this world to attend this meeting. I believe that they should attend. I am asked what is wrong with Basil Landau? He makes an anti-Press speech and then promptly gets put on the Press Commission. I do not think that is very good. I believe that having attended that meeting, the business leaders should make it clear what their viewpoint is. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that the business leaders should make certain points perfectly clear to the Prime Minister. And I believe that those points are: that legislative and regulatory restraints on the private sector have not been removed at anywhere near a sufficient rate to free the system in a meaningful way, and secondly I believe they should tell him that growth is being stultified by lack of skilled workers. The economy and the public service can no longer grow using only the White sector of the economy to staff their enterprises and the Public Service. Both private and public sectors will increasingly have to rely on Black and Brown to grow and not to break down. We only have to look at the shortages in the public sector to realize how true this is. These shortages are not going to be filled until such time as we move the other racial groups into the various categories where there are vacancies.</p>

<p>Thirdly, I should like the business leaders to say that the private sector has great difficulty in training skilled workers if the Government fails in its responsibility to provide adequate basic education for the Black and the Brown people. Finally, I believe, they should say that the Government must urgently remove the laws and regulations that discriminate between workers, White collar or otherwise, on the grounds of their colour.</p>

<p>Let us just look at some of those things. Whenever we say something like this, members on the opposite side always say: Give us some examples. All right, lets take some examples. Let us look at the fact that in suburban areas for many years Indian and Chinese families used to run stores, those little corner stores where we used to go and buy our newspapers, our bread, perhaps some fruit&#x2014;they served a tremendous need in the community and White people flocked to these little stores and they found them extremely useful because often these were very hardworking people who kept these stores open for all of us.</p>

<p>I am not aware that any harm was done to race relations by the fact that these stores were run, or that intergroup relationships suffered any damage. I do not think that I am alone in believing this, I think millions of South Africans think that they did not do any damage. Yet some of those people, not all of them, thank goodness, but a number of them have been forcibly removed from their businesses by this Government. And for what reason? For no other reason than their colour. It happened, and it is still happening.</p>

<p>Now I want to ask the Minister, and he is a verligte Minister, this prospective hon. member for Piketberg, I want to ask him, is this hurtful discrimination? Is it hurtful that we do this? Secondly, does he agree with this type of action? I think he must tell us what his views are. He is fighting an election in Piketberg now. I want him to speak clearly so that the people of Piketberg will know what he stands for. Does he agree with this type of action? Does he consider it to be hurtful discrimination? Does he intend to stand idly by and watch this odious, unjust and degrading process continue, or is he going to fight it? For he, more than anybody, is in a position to fight it successfully.</p>

<p><span class="col_425-426" refersTo="page_0228"/>Then we have the aspect that nobody other than Whites can own or run a business in the central business districts. The heart of any town&#x2019;s business area is for Whites only, if they want to make a profit. But, of course, anyone may shop there. Thats different. We are allowed to make a profit out of the Blacks and Browns, but we won&#x2019;t allow them the profit in those business centres. I want to ask the same questions to the hon. Minister: Is this harmful discrimination? Does he believe that? Does it make for better race relationships that we do not allow Blacks, Indians or Coloured to have shops in central business districts? Does the Minister himself, personally, agree with this policy? We must assume that he does, because he is the Minister of the Government involved in creating and policing and carrying out this policy. I want to know clearly where that hon. Minister stands in this regard. Is it not logical that if Blacks cannot own businesses in the central business districts, then they should not be allowed to shop there? Yet the one happens and the other does not. And all this in the name of self-determination and the protection of ethnic identity. Rubbish, sir, absolute bosh.</p>

<p>The whole of South Africa, other than the Nats, would find the tortious reasoning and the twisted justifications amusing, were they not so tragic in their consequences. And what are those consequences? Strikes, which have no other reason than politics for their very creation. Strikes that employees cannot settle &#x2026; [Time expired.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for Klerksdorp. Perhaps I will be improving in the eyes of the hon. member for De Kuilen in the near future. I was talking about strikes, and I was saying that employees are unable to settle the strikes because the basic reason behind the strikes are that the employees want something that the employers cannot give them by law. The racial tension that is created is getting worse and worse. These strikers want the same benefits as the White employees with whom they work side by side and day by day.</p>

<p>We are playing for enormous stakes in this country. We have the infrastructure, we have the people. We have an abundance of mineral resources. We have know-how and to a degree we have capital resources. But, until we have a Government who will remove the restrictions that bind us, we will never reach our true potential.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to turn from this subject to a local issue. The hon. member for Vasco made a plea in respect of the Western Cape and I wish, along the same sort of lines, to discuss the Port Elizabeth area, and particularly in the light of what has happened so far this session. We have had announcements from the hon. the Prime Minister and from the Minister of Internal Affairs in terms of physical planning, and the hon. Minister himself went to Uitenhage, where he made a speech. I believe that we must raise this with the hon. Minister. He is after all, the Minister of the portfolio of Industries, Commerce and Tourism, and it is that portfolio in relation to the future of Port Elizabeth that concerns me.</p>

<p>Firstly, in the no-confidence debate, the hon. Prime Minister indicated the imminent announcement of the latest economic decentralization and decontrolling plan. That particular announcement seems to be a mixture of the carrot and the stick. The carrot for the decentralized areas, and the stick for the metropolitan areas. The carrot I agree with. I think we should have the carrot, which perhaps should have even caviar on it to attract people to these areas. But I do not agree that we should use the stick on the metropolitan areas. It appears that road subsidies, infrastructure development and even investment allowances could be affected. We are not certain, because it has not been specifically spelt out exactly what it is that is going to be affected, but it does appear that there is going to be a degree of the stick used on metropolitan complexes. There is only one area that actually qualifies as a metropolitan complex in South Africa and that is the PWV complex. To suggest that Port Elizabeth is a metropole is patently absurd. Let&#x2019;s have a look at employment figures: on the PWV roughly 2 million people obtain employment. In Cape Town, approximately 0,6 million. In Durban, 500 000. But in Port Elizabeth, 200 000. In other words less than half of the next biggest so-called metropolitan area. The theory is, <span class="col_427-428" refersTo="page_0229"/>apparently, that metropoles are magnets and attract new industries simply because of their size. This might be true of a genuine metropole, but it does not hold good for Port Elizabeth. I think the trend there is worrying and if the new economic plans are going to actively discourage investment in Port Elizabeth, then I believe the consequences will be serious. Very serious indeed. Already some Port Elizabeth factories have investments elsewhere, and I want to refer also to the General Motors engine plant in Port Elizabeth, which the hon. Minister will know has closed down its operations. The diesel engine plant, in terms of railway locomotives, is still operating, but the actual engine plant of General Motors has closed down. It could have been continued if the Government had taken certain steps about which General Motors approached them. But the Government did not take those steps and that is one factory that is now standing empty with the machinery in moth-balls. Firestone has built a plant in the Transvaal. Volkswagen have moved their central parts department to the Transvaal. It is rumoured that Eveready and Philips Carbon Black are considering investing elsewhere. Why does this happen? It happens because Port Elizabeth suffers from the same disadvantages as the whole of the Eastern Cape and Border. The most serious of these are the high costs of railage and electricity. The motor factory has to rail its steel to Port Elizabeth and pay to transport the finished article back. The textile industry has almost 65&#x0025; of its market on the Reef, and every product sent from Port Elizabeth has a surcharge to cover the railage cost. Let us look at coal. After the last increase, the cost in Port Elizabeth was: Pit-head cost of coal per ton, R10,08, the railage, R18,92. Approximately 65&#x0025; of the cost of a ton of coal in Port Elizabeth was the railage involved.</p>

<p>Then there is electricity. I have pleaded for a national price for some years with no result. The hon. member for Vasco has the same problems, electrical problems in the Western Cape. There are some companies who would save hundreds of thousands of rands if they were charged at Eastern Transvaal rates instead of Port Elizabeth or Border rates. Let us look at those rates. Demand-charge for a large consumer of electricity can vary from R5,46 in the Eastern Transvaal to R9,90 in a Border undertaking&#x2014;an increase of no less than 81&#x0025;. In terms of the tariff for usage, energy charges in cents per kilowatt are: 0,93 cents in the Eastern Transvaal and 1,06 cents in the border undertaking, which is 14&#x0025; higher. These figures translated to actual usage and consumption in the major factories amount to hundreds of thousands of rands extra. In Port Elizabeth we also have to try and attract industry against a multitude of incentives by Border areas concessions in places such as Rosslyn, which is a stone&#x2019;s throw from the PWV.</p>

<p>If now, on top of all this, we have to cope with disincentives, then the consequences could be greatly increased unemployment in the area. I believe we are entitled to ask the Minister: What are your intentions? Will you plead our case with your colleagues, and, more important, will you site any major state or semi-state industry in the area? After all, the Durban area has benefited from the second ISCOR and has many Border concession areas in the close vicinity. Cape Town has been given the Atlantis diesel engines plant, which was, of course, sheer favouritism. Seeing that almost 50&#x0025; of the motor industry was in Port Elizabeth, it was the logical venue, but no, the cinderella area of South Africa was once again ignored. Cape Town was also given Koeberg, although, in view of the siting of Koeberg, I am not sure that I envy them.</p>

<p>In the Eastern Cape they couldn&#x2019;t even complete aspects of the Orange/Fish River Scheme. There were a whole number of hydro-electric plants in the original plan for the Orange River Scheme that were not put in at all. There was another scheme that would have brought more water to the Sunday&#x2019;s River Valley scheme. It was not completed in its entirety and a temporary pumping scheme has been put in its place. I believe that these new plans of the Government are going to be to the detriment of Port Elizabeth. I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he believes that as well. Are we going to be lumped with Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, when we are not even half the size of the smallest of these. I hope not. Only an uncaring, fat cat Government would do such a thing.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, <span class="col_429-430" refersTo="page_0230"/>die agb. lid het eintlik &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer vir Port Elizabeth. Soos ek na hom geluister het, was dit as &#x2019;t ware Port Elizabeth versus die PWV-gebied. In my toespraak sal ek hierop terugkom. Dit is vir my besonder interessant om in die debat te hoor hoe die PFP pleitbesorgers vir die groot nywerheidsbase is, die groot geldmag in die metropolitaanse gebiede. Die ekonomiese geskiedenis van die meer volwasse nywerheidslande dui daarop dat mensekonsentrasies &#x2019;n belangrike stimulus bied vir snelle ekonomiese vooruitgang. Die afgelope twee dekades het egter ook geleer dat oorkonsentrasies van mense en ekonomiese aktiwiteite tot baie ekonomiese en ander nadele aanleiding gee, selfs in so &#x2019;n mate dat optimale ekonomiese groei nie bereik kan word nie. Die vraagstuk van ruimtelike ordening is dus ewe seer &#x2019;n ekonomiese vraagstuk as wat ander disiplines daarby belang het. In Suid-Afrika het daar op vier plekke ekonomiese konsentrasies van groot omvang ontstaan, naamlik die PWV-gebied met ongeveer 5 miljoen mense, die Durban/Pine-town-kompleks met 1,55 miljoen mense, die Kaapse Skiereiland met 1,4 miljoen mense, en dan die Port Elizabeth/ Uitenhage-gebied waarna die agb. lid verwys het, met 700 000 mense. Dit is ook reg om te s&#x00EA; dat dit die kleinste van hierdie vier kom-plekse is. Projeksies dui daarop dat die bevolking in die PWV-gebied in die jaar 2000 ongeveer 9 miljoen mense sal wees, en daarom dan ook die bekommernis van die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth. Dit is interessant dat die grondoppervlakte van hierdie vier konsentrasiepunte slegs 2&#x0025; van die totale oppervlakte van die land beslaan. Dit is waar dat die bevolking van Johannesburg nog betreklik klein is in vergelyking met di&#x00E9; van ander stede, soos Londen en New York. Maar dit is ook waar dat weens die feit dat w&#x00EA;reldstede toegelaat is om onbeheersd te groei, ekonomiese en finansi&#x00EB;le probleme ontstaan het en dat daar tans in al die toonaangewende nywerheidslande doelbewus gepoog word om die verdere konsen-trasie van mense en ekonomiese aktiwiteite teen te gaan. Dit is ook &#x2019;n les vir Suid-Afrika, waar groot stede reeds ontwikkel het en vinnig groei. Daarom is die boodskap dus dat konsentrasie wel ekonomiese voordele inhou tot op &#x2019;n sekere punt. Om optimale ekonomiese groei na te streef, sou dit nodig wees om te verhoed dat metropolitaanse komplekse te groot word, terwyl die totstandkoming van altematiewe konsentrasie-punte terselfdertyd gesteun behoort te word. Verwerkte en aangepaste gegewens dui daarop dat <i>per</i> capta-bedryfskoste van stede skerp begin styg wanneer die 300 000 inwonertal bereik word, en kontra-optimaal raak in gebiede van meer as 400 000 inwoners.</p>

<p>Die tegniese kompleksiteit van infrastruktuurverskaffing en die probleme verbonde aan administratiewe bestuur van al groter wordende munisipaliteite plaas &#x2019;n fisiese beperking op die voordele van massa-dienslewering. Ten einde die maksimale langtermynvoordele, vanuit &#x2019;n ekonomiese oogpunt gesien, te kan benut, is dit dus nodig dat maatre&#x00EB;ls betyds getref word om oorkonsentrasie van ekonomiese aktiwiteite teen te gaan en desentralisasie doelgerig te ondersteun. In di&#x00E9; verband het die owerheid &#x2019;n plig om te vervul, aangesien dit deel van enige land se ekonomiese strategie uitmaak. Ten einde die oorkonsentrasie van mense en ekonomiese aktiwiteite te voorkom, is dit van die allergrootste belang dat die werklike koste van vestiging in stede in perspektief gebring word.</p>

<p>Die natuurlike magnetisme van die metropolitaanse gebiede moet dus doelbewus teengewerk word deur van gesubsidieerde tariewe vir dienste en beleggings wat op die oomblik regstreeks of onregstreeks voorsien word, met inbegrip van vervoer, huisvestig en ander dienste met betrekking tot die in-frastruktuur, na volle kostetoerekenings oor te skakel. Aan die pleidooi dat daar buitefondse toegewys moet word ter bestryding van uitgawes van plaaslike owerhede, behoort nie toegegee te word nie. Die aansienlike belastingverhogings in hierdie groot stede is die logiese gevolg van stede wat te groot geword het en waar kostes van bestuur en beheer sterk styg.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Verdere saak wat die oorkonsentrasie van fabrieke en ander ekonomiese aktiwiteite bevorder en wat reggestel behoort te word, is die tariefstruktuur van die Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwe&#x00EB;. Die feit dat grondstowwe relatief goedkoop vervoer word en <span class="col_431-432" refersTo="page_0231"/>die finale produk teen ho&#x00EB;r tariewe, veroorsaak dat in die sektore waar die vervoer van finale produkte die groot kostefaktor is, fabrieke die groot sentrums meer aantreklik as &#x2019;n vestigingsgebied vind. Dit beteken dan ook dat stedelike vestiging gesubsidieer word en dat nywerhede in metropolitaanse gebiede nie die volle en werklike koste van hulle vestiging bybring nie. Nywerheidsontwikkeling in gedesentraliseerde gebiede sal dus ook bevorder moet word deur middel van finansi&#x00EB;le en ander aansporings en waarborge. Heelwat groter en nuwe soorte vorms van aansporing as die bestaande sal aan nyweraars wat hulle in gedesentraliseerde gebiede wil vestig, aangebied moet word. Ek wil vir u enkeles uitlig.</p>

<p>Aansporings moet daarop gerig wees om te vergoed vir die permanente nadele wat nyweraars in die ontwikkelingsgebiede mag ondervind vanwe&#x00EB; hulle afstand van die ver-naamste markte of hulpbronne. Dit behels byvoorbeeld subsidies om die koste van elektrisiteit te verlig, die verhoging in die bestaande spoorwegtariefkortings, verdere opheffings van die beperkings van motorpadvervoer en die verskaffing van afdoende geriewe ten opsigte van die onderwys, hospitalisasie ensomeer. Verder sal daar ook bystandmaatre&#x00EB;ls verskaf moet word, soos byvoorbeeld die verskuiwingsuitgawe wanneer die nyweraar na &#x2019;n ander gebied verskuif, wat belastingvry toegelaat behoort te word ten einde vir die verskuiwingskoste te vergoed. &#x2019;n Totale belastingkorting op die waarde van geboue, toerusting en huisvesting in die jaar waarin die belegging gemaak word, behoort toegestaan te word. Elektrisiteits probleme wat nyweraars tydelik in ontwikkelingsgebiede ondervind, moet na gekyk word. Ons sal waarskynlik nie veel baat vind by die aanmoediging van streeks-ontwikkeling nie, tensy ons enersyds die trek na metropolitaanse gebiede ook met ekonomiese maatre&#x00EB;ls stuit, en andersyds doeltreffende ekonomiese aansporingsmaat-re&#x00EB;ls instel om streeksontwikkeling te laat slaag. Slegs sodoende sal ons &#x2019;n streeksont-wikkelingstrategie op &#x2019;n sinvolle ekonomiese grondslag kan ontwikkel. My tyd laat my nie toe om daarop uit te brei nie, maar twee streke wat na my mening ho&#x00EB; prioriteit behoort te kry, is die Bloemfontein/ Onverwacht/Thaba&#x2019;Nchu-gebied en die aangrensende streek aan die Sterkspruit/ Herschel-gebied in Transkei.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Volkseenheid is net so &#x2019;n basiese eenheid soos &#x2019;n individu, en net soos wanneer &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n individu die geleentheid gee om sy eie ekonomiese behoeftes en ambisies na te streef dit sal lei tot die voordeel van die gemeenskap, net so wanneer jy vir &#x2019;n volk die vryheid gee om hom ekonomies te bevorder; sal dit lei tot die ekonomiese voorspoed van die hele subkontinent Suider-Afrika. &#x2019;n Mens kan maar net die koerante lees om te sien hoe die Swart leiers hulself en hulle volke ekonomies wil versterk. Dit is deur hierdie beleid wat hulle in daardie posisie geplaas is.</p>

<p>Ons staan aan die vooraand van &#x2019;n nuwe era wat ons desentralisasiebeleid betref. Ons sien met groot verwagting uit na wat hierdie Regering in daardie verband gaan besluit. Watter streke as streeksontwikkelingsge-biede verklaar gaan word, watter voordele hulle gebied word, watter maatre&#x00EB;ls daar getref gaan word wat subsidies in oorgekonsentreerde <span class="col_433-434" refersTo="page_0232"/>gebiede sal verminder en wat dit sal oorplaas na gebiede waar daar groter groei moet wees. In di&#x00E9; verband stem ek nie saam met wat die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal ges&#x00EA; het nie. Hy het gepraat van die &#x201E;carrot&#x201D; en &#x201E;stick&#x201D;. Dit is nie &#x2019;n geval van &#x201E;carrot&#x201D; en &#x201E;stick&#x201D; nie, dit is &#x2019;n geval van meer of minder &#x201E;carrots&#x201D;. As &#x2019;n mens dit so hanteer, dan is dit &#x2019;n kwessie van &#x2019;n aantrekkingskrag aan die een kant en &#x2019;n afstotingskrag aan die ander kant. Die Regeringsbeleid in hierdie verband sal die Regeringsoptrede bepaal. Maar streeksontwik-keling is nie net die taak van die Regering nie. Dit is ook die taak van die plaaslike owerhede, die georganiseerde handel en nywerheid in daardie area en die ontwikkelingsinstansies in daardie area. Dit is dus nie onvanpas om te kyk na watter rol di&#x00E9; instansies moet speel nie. Dit het so &#x2019;n mode geword, en ek dink die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth Sentraal het vir ons so &#x2019;n goeie voorbeeld gegee van hierdie mode, van plaaslike instansies wat maar net published gee aan die werkloosheid in hulle area en dan weer eens met groot published die Regering versoek om desentralisasie-voordele daar te gee. Hulle stel nie ondersoek in na wat hulle self kan doen om daardie posisie te verbeter nie. Om dit te doen, om sodanige publisiteit te verleen, is eintlik kontraproduktief, want daardeur beklemtoon jy die negatiewe. Jy beklemtoon dit, soos die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal gedoen het: hy beklemtoon net die negatiewe in die Port Elizabethgebied. As ek &#x2019;n nyweraar was sou ek beslis nie na Port Elizabeth gegaan het na wat hy hier ges&#x00EA; het nie.</p>

<p>In hierdie verband is daar een streek wat ek graag wil uitsonder, wat sy plig in hierdie verband gedoen het, en op &#x2019;n verantwoordelike wyse gedoen het. Ek verwys na die Pietermaritz-burg-omgewing. Hierdie streek het &#x2019;n baie goeie saak vir streekontwikkelingshulp. Die Edendale-vallei en die Swartkops-area het na raming 280 000 tot 300 000 mense, waarvan in die omstreke van 50 000 tot 60 000 werkloos is. Die geskiedenis het ook daarop gewys dat Staatshulp nodig is vir ekonomiese ontwikkeling in hierdie gebied. Daar was fenominale nywerheidsgroei toe desentrali-sasiehulp verleen is. Toe dit egter in die vroe&#x00EB; sewentigerjare gestaak is, het daar bykans geen ekonomiese groei plaasgevind nie. Hierdie saak is aan die Regering gestel, en word steeds aan die Regering gestel, maar wel op &#x2019;n verantwoordelike wyse. Die instansies in die omgewing het egter ook hand in eie boesem gesteek en gekyk na wat hulle in hierdie verband kon doen. Die gewone dinge is dan ook gedoen. Elektrisiteitstariewe vir nyweraars is aangepas en verminder om dit vir nyweraars daar aantreklik te maak. Nywerheidsgrond is ook teen kom-piterende pryse beskikbaar gestel en die geleenthede en voordele van die gebied is sover moontlik geadverteer.</p>

<p>Daar is egter verder gegaan, &#x2019;n Spesifieke subdepartement is in die stadsraad gestig om nywerheidsgroei te bevorder. Seminare is ook in Johannesburg gehou en skyfies is aan nyweraars vertoon om hul aandag te vestig op die positiewe aspekte in hierdie omgewing. In Maart en April vanjaar is daar ook &#x2019;n afvaardiging van die stadsraad, bygestaan deur &#x2019;n lid van die Afrikaanse Sakekamer en die Kamer van Nywerhede, na Duitsland, Switserland, Frankryk en Engeland gestuur om Pietermaritzburg en Suid-Afrika se saak daar te gaan stel om nyweraars te probeer trek. Die groep is vergesel van &#x2019;n amptenaar van die Suid-Afrikaanse-Duitse Kamer van Handel en Nywerheid, en met die hulp van hierdie kamer, en die NOK se verteenwoor-diger in Duitsland, is daar vyf seminare vir nyweraars in Duitsland gehou. Daar was ook &#x2019;n skyfievertoning in Duits. Daar is ook seminare in die ander lande gehou wat groot belangstelling gewek het. Almal wag egter vir die desentralisasiebeleid van hierdie Regering. Ek wil aan die hand doen dat die optrede van hierdie streek beslis voorgehou kan word as &#x2019;n model van &#x2019;n gemeenskap wat ook bereid is om self inisiatief aan die dag te l&#x00EA; en nie net klaagliedere aan die Regering se adres te rig nie.</p>

<p>Afgesien van faktore soos die beskikbaar-heid van arbeid, grondstowwe en water, en ook beleidsoorwegings, is die belangrikste maatstaf vir die toekenning van desentralisa-sievoordele die gebruik van bestaande infrastruktuur. Dit aanvaar ek. Ek wil aan die hand doen dat wanneer dit kom by onbenutte infrastruktuur &#x2019;n mens nie alleen <span class="col_435-436" refersTo="page_0233"/>moet kyk na fisieke infrastruktuur wat reeds bestaan nie, maar ook na die organisatoriese infrastruktuur wat die groeimomentum verder sal dra. In hierdie verband is Pietermaritzburg &#x2019;n baie goeie voorbeeld. Daar kan ook min twyfel wees oor die feit dat vir elke rand wat bel&#x00EA; word, dit sal bydra tot die skepping van &#x2019;n groot aantal werkgeleent-hede in hierdie gebied, want die grondslag is reeds gel&#x00EA; om nywerhede na hierdie gebied te trek.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek graag verdere verto&#x00EB; tot die Regering rig. Ek wil vra dat ons desen-tralisasie-aksie nie slegs beperk bly tot die vestiging van private nywerhede nie, maar dat die Regering ook indringend aandag skenk aan die desentralisasie van Staatsakti-witeite. In verskeie Europese lande het die Staat die voorbeeld gestel toe &#x2019;n beleid van desentralisasie aanvaar is. Staats-en semi-staatsinstellings verskaf werkgeleenthede aan &#x2019;n groot persentasie mense, en die mense wat deur die Staat in diens geneem word, verskaf weer werk aan ander mense. Slegs die daarstelling van daardie persone is reeds &#x2019;n groot stap vorentoe in die desentralisasie-beleid, maar as die Staat nie bereid is om self te desentraliseer nie, kan daar moeilik voorsien word hoe die Staat se beleid loofwaardigheid in die o&#x00EB; van die privaatsektor kan h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should just like to react briefly to what was said by the hon. member Mr. Schutte.

<p>I am dealing with Adam Smith who, if he could hear this debate, would be crying his eyes out at how he is being misquoted.</p>

<p>I am, however, going to deal with what that hon. member said about decentralization. Instead of all those hon. members talking about planning during the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, they all kept quiet and never said a word. Then they were silent, but now suddenly they have discovered that there is a new concept called decentralization. They are, however, quite wrong. I say they are absolutely wrong, because decentralization has been abandoned by the Government. It is now &#x201C;deconcentration&#x201D;, and I think the hon. the Minister will confirm that. So will that hon. member please put his colleagues in the picture. They are always about 20 years behind the times. Present Government policy is &#x201C;deconcentration&#x201D; and not &#x201C;decentralization&#x201D;. In fact, any of the reports that have been submitted indicate that decentralization has been a complete failure.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>My advice to that hon. member is that he should just relax. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I actually want to speak to the hon. the Minister today about decentralization, but my approach to him is going to be on three specific fronts. Firstly, I am going to appeal to the hon. the Minister to do something about protecting consumers and fighting exploitation in South Africa. Secondly, even though he is not Minister of Finance, I think that is what he should become, because <span class="col_437-438" refersTo="page_0234"/>there is no such thing as the old Minister of Economic Affairs any more, and so I want to ask him to evolve an economic policy, in conjunction with his colleagues, to create a true alternative to Marxism, which is acceptable to deprived and frustrated people. Thirdly I am going to ask him to help in trying to solve one of the major problems of South Africa&#x2014;if not the one real probleem&#x2014;and that is the lack of jobs. My request is therefore that he should assist in the creation of jobs on the cheapest possible basis in order to deal with the probleem, which is going to become monstrous, of increasing unemployment over the next two decades. I should like to deal with those three particular priorities, and it is my intention to deal with them individually.</p>

<p>In terms of the particular portfolio he is now handling, it is quite unbelievable how many hats he is having to wear. In the estimates his portfolio is described as &#x201C;Industries, Commerce and Tourism&#x201D;. There is not a word mentioned about the consumer. Not one word. If one then looks at the objectives that his department sets itself&#x2014;because we are now dealing with budgeting by objectives&#x2014;one finds that the consumer takes a back seat, to say the very least. In the Estimates programme 3 is titled: &#x201C;Internal Trade and Consumer Affairs&#x201D;, and the aim is &#x201C;To promote orderly and fair internal trade&#x201D;. Nowhere is it said that the object is in any way to protect consumers. Throughout the budget consumer affairs merit only one paragraph and an expenditure of R388 100. I think the situation is, however, even worse than that, because the hon. the Minister is not even responsible for all consumer affairs. Consumer affairs involving energy have been taken away from him and have been given to the hon. the Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs. So that hon. Minister also wears two hats. I have also looked through his budget very carefully. I invite other hon. members to scrutinize his budget as well and to tell me where, in the objectives&#x2014;and remember we are budgeting by objectives&#x2014;it is said that there is any need for the hon. the Minister to protect any consumer. [Interjection.] Can any hon. member also tell me perhaps, after going through that budget, where there is even any money voted for that purpose? So the hon. the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism does not even have those consumers under his wing any more.</p>

<p>Let us also have a look at the fixing of prices. The fixing of prices is not his responsibility either when it relates to foodstuffs. [Interjections.] The prices of agricultural products are handled by the hon. the Minister of Agriculture. If one looks at programme 8, dealing with the fixing of the prices of agricultural products and programme 9, dealing with subsidies, one finds that both fail to make any mention of consumers. Only in programme 10 is the word &#x201C;consumer&#x201D; used on a number of occasions, but the objective of that programme is to narrow the gap between producer prices, import prices and consumer prices. What is being said therefore is that one must narrow the gap between production and consumption so that there is very little of a margin there. The whole of that budget, however, is not related to the protection of the consumer either. It is obvious to anybody who has listened to the present hon. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries that he is the Minister of Farming and not a Minister who looks after the interests of the consumer. So we see that the hon. the Minister, whose budget Vote we are discussing, wears a number of hats. He has to wear them all at the same time and consequently has a tremendous conflict of interests, but the consumer hat he is wearing is not even a complete hat because it has a great big hole in it. The tragedy about this hon. Minister is that he is not a Minister who is there to protect the consumer, and protect the consumer is certainly not what he has done.</p>

<p>My appeal today is that in South Africa there should be a Minister of Consumer Affairs who can look after the interests of the consumer, who can stop their exploitation and who can take definite action when something has to be done, without having a conflict of interests at all times. What one needs is a Minister who can deal positively with the situation.</p>

<p>The ordinary consumer today walks through a minefield of monopolies, price rings and little whispered conversations by manufacturers and businessmen in the corners of their clubs about how they are going to fix prices, but no actual open agreements. Other hon. members mentioned this in another context. The hon. the Minister <span class="col_439-440" refersTo="page_0235"/>knows that that is happening, but nothing is being done about it. The person who is suffering is, of course, the poor consumer who has to plod through this minefield.</p>

<p>I do not regard the word &#x201C;profit&#x201D; as a dirty word, but I do regard the word &#x201C;exploitation&#x201D; as a filthy word, and the use of exploitation is becoming more and more prevalent in South Africa. What has happened? The Government decides we are going to fight inflation and uses the tools of monetary control to do so, but in reality the Government has missed out on one aspect, and that is that it has failed to watch the cost structure in South Africa. An authority on the subject, Prof. Botha who is head of the Department of Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand, has repeatedly pointed out that the Government should be as much concerned about price formation as it is about the management of the money supply if we are, in fact, successfully going to fight inflation. Seeing as the hon. the Minister wants to fight inflation, let me ask him today to apply himself to the whole concept of price formation in South Africa in order to deal with the probleem of inflation.</p>

<p>That hon. member asked me that question in the discussion of the Finance Vote and he did not like my answer then. Let me repeat what I have said so that there can be no misunderstanding. If there are exploiters in South Africa who are making use of an inflationary situation, because everybody is used to price increases, impose price control on them and deal with them effectively so that they can serve as an example to the rest in South Africa. I never said&#x2014;and I repeat this once again&#x2014;that I wanted universal price control. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#schwarz">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am indebted to the hon. Whip on the Government side for giving me this opportunity. May I point out that it is no use asking whether one wants price control. The hon. member for Vasco may not know it, but the truth is that even when there are many articles that are not subject to price control, one is not, in fact, allowed to increase the prices without having consulted the hon. the Minister or the head of his department. That is, of course, also a form of price control. So do not let this Government pretend that there is no price control whatsoever in South Africa, because it is untrue. If one maintains that there is none, one is perpetuating an untruth. I think it is really uncalled for from that Keynesian hon. member. As I have said, in South Africa I want a Minister of Consumer Affairs to put an end to this process of looking after conflicting interests. I want somebody in the Government in South Africa to look after the consumer, because the hon. the Minister knows that the South African Consumer Council has no teeth and is not fulfilling its function. He knows that that council should be reconstituted. Let me tell hon. members that members of the South African public are sick and tired of seeing representatives of that council on television justifying price increases, instead of championing the cause of the consumer. I say again that a Minister of Consumer Affairs is urgently needed in South Africa.</p>

<p>The second point I want to deal with is the question of an alternative economic policy. I challenged the hon. the Minister of Finance to debate the economic policy, but was told that I myself had not set out my policy, but was merely mouthing certain precepts. I then stood up to speak again and set out, in great detail, what our policy is, but all I got in reply was a number of irrelevant generalities without his coming to grips with the issue.</p>

When there are efforts in South Africa aimed at improving the lot of people by the so-called liberal institutions that are trying to do that&#x2014;and the word &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; is applied to all kinds of institutions &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>That is where that hon. member falls into the trap, because to the revolutionary, the person who wants to bring about conflict in South Africa, anything that improves the lot of the Black people in South Africa is regarded as being a liberalizing action by a liberal institution such as the Urban Foundation, or Mr. Rive, who is trying to do something to uplift the people in Soweto. They are not Progs. Those are people trying to uplift other people. So that hon. member must try to understand what is happening, in reality, in the area of Black politics in South Africa. The probleem here is that when we in South Africa try to deal with the upliftment of people and try to tell them that they should have houses, have electricity, create a middle-class and put their people into managerial positions, such an effort is attacked because it is in that way that a revolution can be avoided. I want to invite the hon. the Minister to look at some of the debates that are taking place in the Black communities about this very issue. Let me just quote an example from the <i>Sowetan</i> in which mention is made of the great middle-class debate. In fact, in an article under that title it is argued that if Black people are put into managerial positions&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They should not fool themselves and think they have arrived.</block>

<p>Referring to the Blacks going into the managerial positions, it is said towards the end&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They are in a precarious position. They are open to the wrath of the Black people.</block>

<p>It is even said that the fact of Black children attending White schools is a dangerous libe ralizing action because it avoids the possibility of revolution and, in fact, brings about understanding. So these liberalizing statements&#x2014;and I can give a whole list of them&#x2014;are the ones that should be fought against. I can quote numerous people from various Black organizations whom I regard as being on the radical side and who do not, in fact, want the upliftment of the Black people to take place. The question that arises is what we must do about that. I think the answer is very simple.</p>

<p>Firstly, action to bring the Black man fully into the economic system must be accelerated. Secondly we have to deal with the issue of the ownership of assets, of land, of homes and of means of production by the Black man in order to combat Marxism in its true form. Thirdly we have to go further in promoting the advancement of Blacks and placing them in managerial positions. The reality of life is that although one might be able to solve the constitutional probleem in South Africa, if one does not also solve the economic probleem, there will still be a revolution. If, however, one solves the economic probleem in South Africa without solving the constitutional probleem, there will also still be a revolution. So the reality is that the two have to go hand in hand. One has to find a proper answer to Marxism, and the answer is not that the rich should get richer or that there should merely be growth in South Africa. The answer is that there has to be growth in the right sectors, growth in which all of South Africa can participate.</p>

<p>That brings us to the deconcentration policy that has now been announced. The reality of South Africa is that one has to have the jobs. One has to create them as cheaply as one possibly can. One cannot afford to play with ideologies, because one cannot afford to spend R10 000 on a job when one could perhaps create five jobs for the same amount of money in existing urban areas, and by world standards the urban areas or cities of South Africa are small, very small indeed. One only has to look at the PWV area as an example. There is vast room for expansion there, because jobs can be created there at a cheap price. To my mind the creation of jobs, putting people into employment, raising their standard of living, is in fact one of the best answers to Marxism. We have to do that, even if it means that the <span class="col_443-444" refersTo="page_0237"/>Government has to give up some of its ideology, because the issue is not whose politics or ideology will triumph. The issue is whether, in fact, the people of South Africa survive, and from that point of view the real issue is the creating of jobs at the cheapest possible price, putting people into positions where they can make progress. That is the real issue, and that is what has to be done in this South Africa of ours.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think he said that. I certainly do not believe that he said that. What I am trying to put across is a very simple philosophy. I have said as much before. In South Africa one has to have a redistribution of wealth. There is no doubt about that. It is actually taking place at this moment in time. It is taking place in respect of taxation which is levied and in respect of inflation that cannot be combated because one has not yet really got to grips with it. Those are redistributors of wealth. My philosophy, and that of the hon. member for Bryanston, is that there is a cake of a certain size. Let us make it a big cake, because then everybody would have a bigger share, but let us not give the entire cake to those people who are eating it now, because perhaps the reality of South Africa is that some of us&#x2014;and I include the hon. member for Vasco and myself in this&#x2014;must stand still and let some other people get on in the world. That is the reality of South Africa. I do not want anyone to go backwards. I do not want to take anything away from the hon. member for Vasco. I want him to be as happy and as wealthy as he is now, but I want other people to be equally happy and have equal opportunities to get to the same position. That is reality, and that is why we cannot afford to play games with strange ideologies. We have to create jobs at the cheapest price wherever we can, because on that the survival of the people depends.</p>

Ek wil nie baie lank hierby stilstaan nie, behalwe net om te s&#x00EA; dat die agb. lid hom gereeld in verskillende hoedanighede voordoen.

<p>Ek wil self &#x2019;n paar opmerkings maak oor die kwessie van desentralisasie. Die agb. lid vir Yeoville het ges&#x00EA; ons mag nie van &#x201C;desentralisasie&#x201D; praat nie.</p>

<p>Miskien moes hy dit in die eerste instansie aan die agb. lid vir Bryanston ges&#x00EA; het, want die agb. lid vir Bryanston het ook oor desentralisasie gepraat. Trouens, dit was een van die hoof-punte in sy toespraak. Die agb. lid vir Yeoville is egter verkeerd as hy dink dit gaan net oor dekonsentrasie. Hy hoef net die agb. Eerste Minister se toespraak in die Sensuur-debat te gaan lees om te weet wat die werklike toedrag van sake is, want die agb. Eerste Minister het baie duidelik aangedui dat dit gaan om groeipole, hoofdorpe, desentralisasie, dekonsentrasie en dies meer. Die spesialiteitskomitee oor die konstellasie van State, onder voorsitterskap van dr. De Kock, het juis aanbevelings volgens hierdie riglyne van meerdere vorms van verspreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling gemaak. Dit gaan dus nie net oor dekonsentrasie nie. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet liewer praat van verspreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling, want dit is &#x2019;n meer gangbare, omvattende begrip om te beskryf wat werklik hier ter sprake is.</p>

<p>Ek wil egter ook kom by wat die agb. lid vir Bryanston te s&#x00EA; gehad het oor desentralisasie. Hy het ges&#x00EA; die agb. Eerste Minister ontmoedig ekonomiese ontwikkeling in die metropole, en hy het uit die agb. Eerste Minister se Hansard-toespraak aangehaal om dit te staaf. Daardie bewering is egter nie korrek nie. Die agb. Eerste Minister het ges&#x00EA; dit is onmoontlik om die ekonomiese ontwikkeling op &#x2019;n verspreide grondslag te bevorder, as &#x2019;n mens nie die natuurlik <span class="col_445-446" refersTo="page_0238"/>suigkrag in die metropole op een of ander manier kan te&#x00EB;werk nie. Vir die inligting van die agb. lid vir Bryanston, wil ek net graag aanhaal wat die agb. Eerste Minister ook verder ges&#x00EA; het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Regering voel baie sterk omtrent nywerheidsontwikkeling in gedesentrali-seerde gebiede, hoewel daar besef word dat bestaande metropolitaanse gebiede ook moet ontwikkel.</block>

<p>Ek dink dit is baie duidelik dat daar &#x2019;n balans moet wees. Dit is iets wat die agb. Eerste Minister baie duidelik uitgespel het.</p>

<p>Wat ek egter wil weet, is hoe die agb. lid vir Bryanston en die agb. lid vir Yeoville wel wil desentraliseer. Hulle het tot dusver net met &#x2019;n klomp klagtes gekom oor die grondslag waarop ons dan sou wil desentraliseer. Watter aansporingsmiddele moet aangebied word vir die vestiging van nywerhede in die landelike gebiede? Daardie agb. lede het klaarblyklik &#x2019;n obsessie ontwikkel, want hulle wil beweer dat enige vorm van desen-tralisasie wat van hierdie kant van die Raad afkomstig is, te make sou h&#x00EA; met die bevordering van die sogenaamde apartheidsbeleid. Dit is egter onsin, en ek ontken dit ten sterkste. Ons hoef net te gaan kyk na die werk wat reeds gedoen is. Ons hoef net te gaan kyk na die aanbevelings van die spesialiteits-komitee oor die konstellasie van State, die De Kock-komitee. Wat is die samestelling van daardie komitee? Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het prof. Jan Lombard hier aangehaal. Daardie agb. heer was onder andere &#x2019;n lid van die De Kock-komitee. Ek dink die agb. lede wil egter net hul obsessie verder vertroetel, eerder as om te probeer aandui hoe ons konstruktief die gedagte van verspreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika kan bevorder.</p>

<p>Die punt is dus hoe ons die bestaande ekonomiese kragte&#x2014;en ekonomiese kragte bestaan daar tog, en hulle kan slegs bevorder word met bepaalde politieke of ander in-strumente&#x2014;kan aanwend om by verspreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling uit te kom. Ek dink dit is hier &#x2019;n kwessie van ekonomiese kragte wat reeds bestaan, en dit geld die hele kapitalistiese stelsel. As ons s&#x00EA; ons wil &#x2019;n gemiddelde groeikoers van 5&#x0025; handhaaf, sal ons in een jaar miskien &#x2019;n groeikoers van 8&#x0025; kan h&#x00EA;, soos verlede jaar, en ander jare miskien minder. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston s&#x00EA; dat ons opgesaal sit met &#x2019;n ekonomiese beleid wat gegrond is op &#x2019;n apartheidsbeleid en dat dit daadwerklike groei teenwerk. Waarom het ons dan verlede jaar &#x2019;n ekonomiese groeikoers van 8&#x0025; gehad? Vanjaar gaan ons waarskynlik &#x2019;n groeikoers van 4&#x0025; h&#x00EA;, en volgende jaar moontlik 2&#x0025;. Met in-agneming van die bestaande groeikragte, is die vraag egter op die ou end hoe &#x2019;n mens nywerheidsontwikkeling en -vestiging kan bevorder deur teen die bestaande ekonomiese kragte in te werk of daardie kragte tot jou eie voordeel aan te wend. Ek dink dit is die kuns. Dit is die saak wat die spesialiteits-komitee behandel het, en dit is hul aanbevelings oor daardie punt wat tans voor die Kabinet dien. Die agb. Eerste Minister het dan ook aangedui dat daar voor die einde van die jaar &#x2019;n besluit daaroor geneem sal word. Met ander woorde, daar moet bepaal word wat die bepaalde aansporingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls is wat aangewend kan word om hierdie saak te bevorder.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bryanston moet egter sy feite regkry wanneer hy die Regering wil beskuldig van die verontagsaming van ekonomiese feite. In di&#x00E9; verband wil ek graag verwys na die Kommissie vir Samewerking se bevindings oor ekonomiese ontwikkeling. Ek dink die agb. lid ken die betrokke toespraak, want hy het al self vroe&#x00EB;r daarna verwys. Ek verwys natuurlik na die agb. lid, mnr. H. J. D. van der Walt se toespraak gedurende die eerste sessie vanjaar in die Raad. Daar het hy juis die bevindings van die kommissie behandel. Dit dui mos nie op &#x2019;n verontagsaming van ekonomiese feite nie. Die agb. lid hoef ook maar net te gaan kyk na die bevindings van die spesialiteitskomitee oor konsolidasie. Daar kry &#x2019;n mens eweneens &#x2019;n aanduiding dat die ekonomiese werklikhede wel in ag geneem word en dat ons teen daardie agter-grond probeer om die gedagte van ekonomiese verspreiding in Suid-Afrika te bevorder.</p>

<p>Meneer, die agb. lid weet tog dat desen-tralisasie nie net om politieke redes van belang is nie. Hier gaan dit ewe-eens ook om die ekonomiese gevolge as ons nie daarin sou slaag om ekonomiese verspreiding in Suid-Afrika te kry nie. Dit het ook implika-sies ten opsigte van behuising, onderwys, werkverskaffing ens. Daar word bereken dat <span class="col_447-448" refersTo="page_0239"/>daar oor die volgende 20 jaar &#x2019;n verdubbeling van die totale stedelike bevolking van Suid-Afrika gaan wees. Van hierdie 13 miljoen meer mense, sal ongeveer 10 miljoen Swart mense wees. Aan normale standaarde gemeet, beteken dit dat daar 10 nuwe Soweto&#x2019;s van die huidige Soweto se omvang sal moet wees. Daardie Swart stede kan tog nie almal in ons metropole gevestig word nie. Uit &#x2019;n ekonomiese, politieke en maatskaplike oogpunt gesien, moet daar &#x2019;n voordelige verspreiding wees. Dit is dus nie net die politiek wat hier &#x2019;n rol speel nie. Terself-dertyd erken ons&#x2014;dit is nie &#x2019;n nuwe besef aan hierdie kant van die Raad nie&#x2014;dat in-stromingsbeheer nie die enigste middel is wat hierdie probleem vir ons gaan oplos nie. As &#x2019;n mens per slot van rekening bloot in-stromingsbeheer gaan toepas, sal dit tot werkloosheid en verarming in die landelike gebiede aanleiding gee. Dit is &#x2019;n feit en ons stry nie daaroor nie. Die vraag is hoe ons verspreide ekonomiese aktiwiteit tot die heil van die totale samelewing op die terreine waarvan ek gepraat het, kan aanwend. Die antwoord is dat die landelike gebiede, wat onder meer die onafhanklike state en die nasionale state insluit, op ekonomiese gebied moet ontwikkel, nie net vir hulle eie heil nie, maar vir die heil van die totale bevolking. Daarom het ons hier nie net met &#x2019;n politieke argument te doen nie. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston probeer &#x2019;n slenter daarvan maak deur &#x2019;n onderwerp wat van baie min belang is in hierdie debat tot die belangrikste onderwerp te verhef.</p>

<p>In die tyd wat nog tot my beskikking is, wil ek in hierdie verband na &#x2019;n ander aangeleentheid verwys. Dit hou verband met &#x2019;n aanbeveling van die De Kock-komitee. In Hansard (kolom 56 van 3 Augustus 1981) s&#x00EA; die agb. Eerste Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die komitee beveel aan dat al die voorgestelde aansporings en die maksimum vlakke in die gekose balanserende groeipole van toepassing sal wees, terwyl net party daarvan, en gewoonlik op heelwat laer vlakke, in die dekonsentrasiegebiede van toepassing sal wees.</block>

<p>Ek wil nie hierdie aangeleentheid in te veel besonderhede behandel nie, want die tyd laat my nie toe om dit te doen nie, maar ek wil &#x2019;n pleidooi lewer dat, gedagtig aan ver spreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling, daarop ag geslaan moet word dat byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n groei-punt soos Rosslyn in die vroe&#x00EB; sestigerjare vir ons in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n baie doeltreffende begrip was en dat ons daardie begrip as &#x2019;n voorbeeld moet gebruik waarop ons kan voortbou met betrekking tot verspreide ekonomiese vestiging. Sommige ander pogings was minder suksesvol, maar ek dink tog dat die Rosslyn-konsep &#x2019;n bepaalde patroon geskep het waarop ons kan konsentreer. Ek wil die pleidooi lewer dat ons aansporings-maatre&#x00EB;ls daarop gemik sal wees om hierdie konsep te probeer uitleef.</p>

<p>Laastens wil ek daarop wys dat die PWV-gebied die hartland van die ekonomiese ontwikkeling van Suid-Afrika is. Wat getalle betref, is dit egter ook die hartland van die Blanke. Terwyl ons oor die onderwerp van verspreide ekonomiese ontwikkeling praat, dink ek dit is belangrik om daarop te let dat hierdie ontwikkeling ook aangewend moet word om daardie hartland as &#x2019;n basis vir die Blanke te verseker. Ons kan nie die onbeheerde groei van Swart getalle in daardie gebied toelaat nie. Die rede hiervoor is dat ons daardeur &#x2019;n potensiaal vir toenemende konflik sal skep. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat die PWV-gebied uit hierdie oogpunt beskou word.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. D. TERBLANCHE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, omdat ek vanmiddag &#x2019;n belang-rike saak hier wil opper, moet agb. lede my verskoon as ek hulle nie volg in wat hulle ges&#x00EA; het nie.</p>

<p>In die sensuurdebat het die agb. Eerste Minister besondere belangrike stellings gemaak. Ek wil graag kort aanhalings uit sy toespraak voorlees. In verband met desen-tralisasie het hy onder meer ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die vernaamste oogmerke is om &#x2019;n meer ewewigtige verspreiding van ekonomiese bedrywigheid binne die Republiek te verseker &#x2026;<br/>Op die oomblik is daar &#x2019;n oormatige konsentrasie van ekonomiese bedrywigheid in die vier groot metropolitaanse gebiede &#x2026;<br/>Dit is &#x2019;n ongesonde toedrag van sake &#x2026;</block>

<p>Hierdie stellings is inderdaad belangrike stellings en ek sal vir agb. lede s&#x00EA; waarom ek so <span class="col_449-450" refersTo="page_0240"/>dink. Dit is belangrik omdat daar gebiede in hierdie land is wat agtergebly het en waar nywerheidsvestiging nou noodsaaklik geword het om in die groeiende nood van mense te voorsien en om &#x2019;n ewewigtiger verspreiding van ekonomiese bedrywigheid in die Republiek tot stand te bring. Die Bloemfontein-Vaalkraal-Onverwacht-Thaba Nchu-substreek van Ontwikkelingstreek 31 kan as so &#x2019;n noodgebied ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer word. Hier sal nywerhede nou baie vinnig gevestig moet word om &#x2019;n ernstige noodtoestand af te weer.</p>

<p>Die besluit van die Regering om die Vaalkraal-Onverwacht-gebied naby Thaba Nchu te verkry met die oog op die ontwikkeling van &#x2019;n volwaardige stad vir die Suid-Sotho het meegebring dat &#x2019;n relatief groot nuwe Swart stedelike kompleks ongeveer 48 kilometer ten ooste van Bloemfontein aan die verrys is. Binne die kort tyd van 2 jaar het hierdie stad reeds gegroei tot &#x2019;n stad met &#x2019;n bevolking van meer as 80 000. Net uit Thaba Nchu is 60 000 Sotho&#x2019;s daar hervestig. Die bevolking van hierdie stedelike gebied sal volgens kenners in die volgende dekade tot 200 000 toeneem. Swartes van ander landelike gebiede, ook van buite die substreek, stroom daarheen in die hoop dat hulle na Bloemfontein sal kan pendel en dat hulle in Bloemfontein werk sal kan kry.</p>

<p>Afgesien egter van die toestroming na die Vaalkraal-Onverwacht-gebied is daar &#x2019;n byna onafgebroke insypeling van Swart mense in die omstedelike gebied van Bloemfontein. Die plakkery by Nyanga het &#x2019;n storm veroorsaak, maar ek wil s&#x00EA; dat daar net soveel &#x201E;bedekte&#x201D; plakkery rondom Bloemfontein is. Die verskil is net dat hierdie plakkers soos spelde in &#x2019;n hooimied verdwyn. Volgens skatting, want werklike syfers kan nie vasgestel word nie, is daar op die oomblik in die omgewing van Bloemfontein nagenoeg tussen 25 000 tot 30 000 Swartes op die hoewes en klein plasies, van wie 21&#x0025; werkloos is en in armoede leef. Ook in die Vaalkraal-Onverwacht-gebied heers daar &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; persentasie werkloosheid. In die onbeheerde toestande wat daar heers, is dit nie moontlik om te s&#x00EA; wat die werklike werkloosheidsyfer is nie. Gevalle het voorgekom waar daar in een klein huisie 15 mense woon.</p>

<p>Hierdie werkloosheid het ook &#x2019;n korrelasie met die vlaag van diefstalle en inbrake in Bloemfontein. Dit is iets wat kommer wek. Die fenominale toename in die Swart bevolkingsgetalle in die gebied verhoog die arbeidsdruk dag na dag en daarmee saam die behoefte aan infrastruktuur soos skole, gesondheidsdienste en behuising vir hierdie mense. Niks minder nie as drastiese stappe sal nodig wees om ernstige maatskaplike, politieke, veiligheids-en ekonomiese probleme te voorkom. Gemeenskapsleiers in die Vrystaat raak al hoe meer besorg oor die verloop van sake. Die Instituut vir Sosiale en Ekonomiese Navorsing aan die Vrystaatse Universiteit het bevind dat die werkloosheid-situasie in die Vrystaat-streek reeds sorg-wekkend is.</p>

<p>Indien daar nie spoedig omvangryke maat-re&#x00EB;ls getref word om ontwikkeling te bevorder en nywerhede op te rig ten einde vir hierdie mense werk te gee nie, kan &#x2019;n toestand ontstaan waaroor die owerhede met-tertyd nie beheer sal kan uitoefen nie. Bloemfontein is in staat om in die arbeidsbe-hoeftes van &#x2019;n ordelike en normale groei-proses te voorsien, en doen sy plig in hierdie verband, maar die stad is nie in staat om werkgeleenthede te voorsien wanneer daar by die poorte van die stad &#x2019;n bevolkingsont-ploffing plaasvind waarvoor hy verantwoor-delikheid moet aanvaar nie. Spesiale en desnoods unieke maatre&#x00EB;ls sal getref moet word om die skepping van werkgeleenthede vir hierdie mense op &#x2019;n realistiese grondslag te bevorder. Bloemfontein sit oorgehaal en is gereed om sy deel te doen. Hy het sy same-werking reeds op geesdriftige wyse aangebied. Die stadsvaders wil nou egter graag weet watter finansi&#x00EB;le hulp die Regering kan aanbied vir die voorgestelde nuwe nywer-heidsgebied waarvan die ontwikkelingskoste etlike miljoene rand sal beloop. Hulle wil ook weet of die desentralisasievoordele wat aan nyweraars gebied sal word, voldoende sal wees om ondernemers na Bloemfontein te trek en hulle daar te hou. Ons is daarvan bewus dat die probleem die Regering se aan-dag geniet en ons is baie dankbaar daaroor. Ons bepleit egter dat ho&#x00EB; prioriteit hieraan geskenk word omdat die nood werklik hoog is.</p>

<speech by="#watterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. WATTERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Before I start with the main part of my address, I must clear up one little point that was raised by my colleague, the hon. member for Aman-zimtoti, in that he gave the impression that I was something of an authority on bricks. I am sorry if I am going to drop a brick on him, but I am not really an authority on bricks. However, I can make one point in regard to what he was saying about the monopolistic actions in respect of brick making, particularly in Natal. Over the last 25 or 30 years there have been a number of undertakings to make bricks and in each case they have, for one reason or another, been forced to close down or have been bought out by the local cartel. The principal method of doing this is to ensure that if they only make bricks, that whoever buys those bricks will not get tiles to put on their roof, or if they are manufacturing common bricks, they will not get face bricks, so that they are virtually forced to go back into the cartel in order to get their products. I make that point, but as I say, I am not an authority on bricks.</p>

<p>We are living in a free enterprise society. Our Dutch and English forebears who came to South Africa, came here for one reason only, namely business. It was the Dutch East India Company, the British East India Company, etc. South Africa was created for business. If these people had to contend with the governmental rules&#x2014;when I say &#x201C;governmental&#x201D; I am using it in the broadest sense&#x2014;that we have to contend with in business today they probably would never have got here in the first place.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. WATTERSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is as may be, but I said that I am using the expression in the broadest sense. The point is that they could never have developed unless the governments of the day gave them a free hand, to a very large extent, to develop. Having said that, I do not want to be misunderstood. I do not believe that big business, or any business, is all beautiful and is looking after the welfare of everybody. There is a very very ugly face to business when it comes to monopolistic tendencies and cartels, etc. I am not against certain controls. I am merely saying that the control situation as prevailing today militates against business development, and not because of the Government alone. Provincial governments get in on the act and so do local authorities. When it comes to the Government, a businessman has to contend with a whole range of Acts. I am not saying that some of them are not necessary. Some may well be necessary, but there are too many of them. We have the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, the Factories Act, the Industrial Conciliation Act, the Companies Act and all sorts of regulations. That is only from the Government&#x2019;s side. When you get to the provinces, you have licensing and shop house ordinances, etc. Municipalities do not miss out either, but get their share too. They are in on planning and have further licensing rules. In addition they have building regulations, health regulations, fire regulations and many more. I have been through local government and provincial government and I am just beginning to learn about Central Government. The thing is that if you are going to start in business today you either have to have a legal background yourself or have to employ somebody to get you through the hazards of getting into business.</p>

<p>In a society such as we live in today I believe we cannot afford to work to the systems in the more sophisticated economically developed societies. They perhaps can afford to have all these stringent regulations, but so far as we are concerned I believe that if we are to create the job opportunities that are required, we must be a little more lenient in getting people up and going in business. It has been said that there is orthodox business <span class="col_453-454" refersTo="page_0242"/>and the unorthodox business of the odd individual trying to set up business. That is the cheapest way of creating job opportunities. As the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned, there is not much point in creating jobs at R20 000 each if you can create them at R1 000 each. The small one man, two man or three man type of business is the sort of business which can be very productive in creating job opportunities. I am afraid we do not take sufficient advantage of this. Coming to a further point that I believe militates against the ease of running a business, are the regulations relating to the Companies Act, which make life for small businessmen hell on earth. Not only that, they are highly inflationary. It may surprise hon. members to learn that the regulations of the Companies Act can be inflationary, but I can give a small example of what I mean. There are many small companies in South Africa today that become companies to buy small buildings. I know of one who has an income of only about R5 000 per annum. There is no reasonable way of making it not a company. I know it can be done, but the rigmarole involved in that is quite tricky.</p>

<p>Private or public company?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#watterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. WATTERSON</person>:</from>

<p>A Pty company. It is a property company with, as I say, an income of only R5 000 per year. In this particular instance the rules contained in the Companies Act necessitate audit, registration, etc. and the total fees that have to be paid are something in the region of R400 per year. This is in itself not an excessive amount, but when one bears in mind that this is a small property company owning 3 semi-detached houses, it means that they are required to pay virtually one total month&#x2019;s rent of the 3 cottages to comply with the Companies Act. Those are rent-controlled buildings.</p>

<p>I can quote another example of a company owning a block of 7 flats that has a total income, because of rent-control, of only R7 000 per year. The same sort of thing applies there.</p>

<p>What I am suggesting, is that possibly it would ease matters a lot if, in terms of the rules and regulations relating to business, private companies could be divided into two groups. I am now not talking about the very large organizations or public companies at all. If the smaller companies are divided into two groups, the companies with lower gross turnovers&#x2014;the exact figure can be worked out, but certainly companies with a lower gross turnover than R50 000 per year&#x2014;could be exempted from a great deal of the rigmarole which is laid down in terms of the Companies Act. I think it would be in the interest of all concerned, and certainly in the case of the two property companies I mentioned. Pensioners and people who are living in rent-controlled flats are going to have to pay increased rents purely and simply to pay the amount which is laid down that these companies have to pay to comply with the regulations of the Companies Act. I really do believe that this is not in the interests of South Africa and is inflationary.</p>

<p>I would just like to make one further point that was raised by the hon. member for Yeoville, and, to a lesser degree, by the hon. member for Amanzimtoti. The hon. member for Yeoville raised the question of exploitation. I think this is one of the ugly faces of the free enterprise system. The hon. member for Amanzimtoti referred to greed on the part of businessmen. These two points, exploitation and greed, are as responsible as anything for the inflationary situation we have in this country. The Government cannot avoid a certain amount of its share and I am not arguing that, but exploitation and greed on the part of many businessmen are the cause of much of the trouble we have. As a businessman myself, I think I can say that. In the past businessmen were satisfied with a reasonable percentage, but today if they cannot get 30, 40 or 50&#x0025; they are not interested.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN NYWERHEIDSWESE, HANDEL EN TOERISME</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag aan die begin die agb. lid vir Bryanston en die agb. lid vir Amanzimtoti, asook die agb. lid vir Klerks-dorp, baie hartlik bedank vir die gelukwense wat hulle aan my oorgedra het. Toe die agb. lid vir Bryanston begin praat het, het ek gehoop dat ons as &#x2019;n nuwe span, ek as die nuwe Minister en hy as hoofwoordvoerder van die amptelike Opposisie, wat die Departement van Nywerheidswese, Handel en Toerisme betref, &#x2019;n nuwe benadering s&#x00E4;l <span class="col_455-456" refersTo="page_0243"/>volg en ten minste oor die belangrikste sake rakende nywerheidsgroei in Suid-Afrika, die handel en toerisme sal praat en dat ons sulke besprekings nie sal verlaag tot &#x2019;n gewone politieke debat nie. Die agb. lid het wel &#x2019;n paar positiewe opmerkings gemaak, maar hy, sowel as sy bankmaat, die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal, het maar weer die debat probeer omswaai tot &#x2019;n suiwer politieke tirade. Ek sal later op enkele van di&#x00E9; aspekte waarop hulle kommentaar gelewer het, terugkom. Die agb. lid was so vriende-lik om my sterkte toe te wens vir die komende verkiesing en het ges&#x00EA; dat die vyf lede wat sy party in daardie kiesafdeling steun waarskynlik vir my sal stem. Ek wil hom net die versekering gee dat ons ondervinding presies die teenoorgestelde is. PFP-lede wil in die openbaar altyd graag hulle distansie van die party aan die regterkant, die HNP, uitspel, maar die ondervinding het bewys dat hulle agter die skerms saam knoei en dat hulle anti-Regeringsgesindheid sterker is as hulle pro-Suid-Afrikaanse-houding. Dit vind ons ongelukkig ook in die tussen-verkiesingsveldtog wat tans in Piketberg gehou word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het &#x2019;n opmerking of twee gemaak wat my amper van my stoel af laat val het. Hy het gepraat van die &#x201E;economie revolution&#x201D; en die groot transformasie wat dan nou in Suid-Afrika besig is om plaas te vind. Hy het ook gepraat van &#x2019;n oorgangstydperk en &#x2019;n heraanpassingstyd-perk. Ek kon nie help om te dink aan die verwysings wat so dikwels aan daardie kant van die Raad kom dat hierdie Regering verantwoordelik is vir stagnasie, nie vordering maak nie en dat wat ons doen niks anders as o&#x00EB;verblindery en kosmeties van aard is nie. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston erken nou ten minste dat daar groot veranderinge en &#x2019;n transformasie ook op ekonomiese gebied besig is om in Suid-Afrika plaas te vind. In plaas daarvan dat die agb. lid daarvandaan verder gaan en aansluit by die goeie jare wat ons op ekonomiese gebied geniet en wys op die lewenskrag en spierkrag van die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie en sodoende &#x2019;n positiewe noot laat hoor, maak hy ongelukkig die stereotipe flater wat so eie is aan lede van die amptelike Opposisie om in pessimisme te verval.</p>

<p>Daar is soveel waarna die agb. lid kon verwys om te wys op die goeie ekonomiese tydperk wat Suid-Afrika ondervind, maar daarvan verneem ons niks. As iemand van buite vandag na sy tirade moes luister, sou hy inderdaad met &#x2019;n baie pessimistiese sien-ing oor die toekoms van Suid-Afrika en die ekonomiese krag van hierdie land weggaan.</p>

<p>My tyd is beperk en ek kan nie op al die aspekte ingaan nie, maar ek wil tog graag na &#x2019;n paar verwys. Volgens die jongste ekonomiese oorsig van die Departement van Statistiek het werkloosheid oor die twaalf maande tot Mei vanjaar, om maar &#x2019;n enkele syfer te noem, onder Blankes, Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs met 28,8&#x0025; gedaal. Ek kan ook wys op die verdienste van mense wat verbeter het. Daar is soveel aanwysers wat daarop dui dat daar &#x2019;n inherente lewenskrag in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie is.</p>

<p>Ek kan nog &#x2019;n ander aspek noem wat getuig van die wesenlike inherente krag wat in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie aanwesig is. Ek verwys nou na die enorme groeikrag in die Suid-Afrikaanse fabriekswese. Vaste kapitaalbates het in die fabriekswese van R24 954 miljoen in 1979 tot meer as R28 miljoen in Desember 1980 gestyg. Dit is &#x2019;n toename van 14,2&#x0025;. Nog belangriker is dat die verwagte besteding wat reeds aankondig is en tans in die pyplyn is ten opsigte van die vergroting van bestaande kapasiteit en die skepping van nuwe kapasiteit in die fabriekswese meer as R12 000 miljoen beloop. Daar word beraam dat daar in 1981 amper R4 000 miljoen aan nuwe investering in die fabriekswese bestee sal word. Daar word beraam dat investering in 1982 meer as R2,2 biljoen sal wees. So kan ek voortgaan. Dit is getuienis dat die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie kernge-sond is. Na die buitengewone ho&#x00EB; groeitempo, veral gedurende 1980 toe ons &#x2019;n groeikoers van 7&#x0025; behaal het volgens die jongste aangepaste syfers van die Departement van Statistiek en nie 7,9&#x0025; soos hulle aanvanklik aangedui het nie, kan &#x2019;n mens tog aanvaar dat na hierdie periode van hoog-konjunktuur ons ook &#x2019;n periode van laag-konjunktuur sal moet binnegaan. So seker soos die opeenvolging van die seisoene, waar winter en somer mekaar afwissel, so word ook &#x2019;n periode van ho&#x00EB; ekonomiese aktiwi-teit en groei gevolg deur &#x2019;n periode van kon-solidasie waarin ekonomiese aktiwiteite verminder en afplat. As ek die simboliek van die seisoene verder kon gebruik en op die huidige stand van die ekonomie van toepassing <span class="col_457-458" refersTo="page_0244"/>kon maak, sou &#x2019;n mens kon s&#x00EA; dat die huidige ekonomiese situasie die feit weer-spie&#x00EB;l dat die ekonomiese herfs aangebreek het en dat ons na die periode van besondere groei, die hoogkonjunktuur van die afgelope jare, ons nou moet gereedmaak vir &#x2019;n periode van konsolidasie en aanpassing wat &#x2019;n komende winterseisoen sal kenmerk sodat ons onsself gereed kan maak vir &#x2019;n nuwe periode van groei en ontwikkeling.</p>

<p>The fact remains, Mr. Chairman, that the economy is still very buoyant. The downward adjustment which has set in is quite normal after the high level of activity experienced last year. Being normal it gives no ground for pessimistic expectations. It is also important to remember that the lower growth rate that we will all experience this year, is continuing from the very high base of 1980. I should therefore like to sound a word of caution regarding the psychological side of the business climate. People tend to over-react when the economy enters a slower growth phase as we are entering now, and this results in business becoming over-pessimistic. When an upswing occurs this changes to over-optimism. Let us be realistic because the South African economy must now consolidate in order to achieve a solid base for the next period of growth and expansion. Let us guard against people and politicians who try to talk the economy down.</p>

<p>Dit is in hierdie verband dat &#x2019;n mens dit jammer vind dat die agb. lid vir Bryanston nie ook die positiewe aspekte van dit wat ons tans ondervind nader kon toelig en nie ook vertroue kon vestig in die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie nie. Wat my opval wanneer &#x2019;n mens met buitelandse sake-manne praat&#x2014;en daar is baie met groot belange in Suid-Afrika&#x2014;is die mate van optimisme en vertroue wat hulle uitspreek aangaande die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie. Ek sal graag die feit wil beklemtoon dat die Regering &#x2019;n moeilike balans moet behou om aan die een kant die belangrike mikpunt van groei na te streef en voldoende werkgeleenthede te skep sonder om aan die ander kant inflasie loshand te laat toeneem. Die handhawing van &#x2019;n goeie en gesonde groeikoers is vir ons &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; prioriteit veral vanwe&#x00EB; die belangrikheid om vir ons groeiende bevolking voldoende werkgeleenthede te skep. Verskeie sprekers het na hierdie aspek verwys. Die Regering glo egter dat die skep-ping van genoeg werkgeleenthede en die handhawing van &#x2019;n gesonde groeikoers alleen moontlik sal wees indien ons vrye in-isiatief aanmoedig en die markkragte die geleentheid bied om in Suid-Afrika die grootste rol te speel. Die Regering se sentimente oor die vryemark-ekonomie is welbekend en is ook reeds by verskeie geleenthede deur die agb. Eerste Minister uitgespel. Dit moet egter nie daardeur verstaan word dat die Regering van voomeme is om die rol van die Staat in die ekonomie op te s&#x00EA; nie of om &#x2019;n totale vryespel van ekonomiese kragte toe te laat nie. Die werklikheid in Suid-Afrika is dat ons &#x2019;n gemengde ekonomiese stelsel het en dat daar baie goeie redes bestaan&#x2014;waarop ek ook later sal wil terugkom&#x2014;waarom dit nodig is om &#x2019;n gesonde mengsel van openbare en private aktiwiteite ook in die toekoms in ons ekonomie te behou. &#x2019;n Gemengde ekonomiese stelsel beteken dat die werking van die markmeganisme op &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van maniere deur Staatsoptrede beskerm, be&#x00EF;nvloed, gekorrigeer en aangevul word. Dit kan trouens selfs in die geheel vervang word. Die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal het hier &#x2019;n &#x201E;truly free enterprise system&#x201D; kom propageer. Daardie agb. lid maak egter die fout om &#x2019;n vryemark-ekonomie met &#x2019;n <i>laissez-f</i>a<i>ire</i>-stelsel gelyk te stel. Ekonomiese voorspoed, ook in Suid-Afrika, verg nog steeds &#x2019;n basis van ordelike en harmonieuse ver-houdinge. Daar sonder kan die ekonomiese groei wat ons nastreef, waaruit werkgeleenthede geskep moet word en waardeur die lewensomstandighede van al Suid-Afrika se inwoners verbeter moet word, net nie plaasvind nie. Daardie agb. lid staan daarop dat die Regering te kort skiet in sy aanspraak dat die markkragte die grootste geleentheid gebied moet word om hul rol te speel omdat daar beperkende wetgewing en situasies in Suid-Afrika bestaan. Ek wil die agb. lid egter vra&#x2014;en ek weet wat die agb. lid vir Yeoville in hierdie verband sal s&#x00EA;&#x2014;as dit dan sy versoek is dat die Regering homself van die ekonomie moet bevry, wat dan van die noodsaaklike dienste wat gelewer moet word? Wat van die betrokkenheid van die Regering wat betref die sosio-ekonomiese <span class="col_459-460" refersTo="page_0245"/>maatre&#x00EB;ls wat getref moet word om mense op te hef?</p>

<p>Ek vind dit moeilik om te verstaan hoe al die pole in daardie party met mekaar versoen kan bly.</p>

<p>Daar is diegene wat veralgemeen soos die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal vanmiddag probeer doen het en eintlik wil voorgee dat die Staat geen rol in die ekonomie te speel het nie. Dit is &#x2019;n onderwerp waarop ek nie vanmiddag in die beperkte tyd tot my beskikking, wil uitbrei nie, behalwe om dit duidelik te stel dat Suid-Afrika die uitda-gings van die toekoms&#x2014;en veral die uitdaging van die tagtigerjare&#x2014;alleen die hoof sal kan bied deur &#x2019;n doelgerigte en effektiewe gesamentlike poging van die openbare en private sektor. Die tagtigerjare het die potensiaal om op ekonomiese gebied die mees dina-miese dekade tot dusver in die Suid-Afrikaanse geskiedenis te word. In skrille kontras met baie lande van die Derde W&#x00EA;reld in Afrika waar ekonomiese agteruit-gang en verval aan die orde van die dag is, geniet die Republiek van Suid-Afrika ekonomiese voorspoed en vooruitgang en is die vooruitsigte vir die toekoms nog groter. Die voorwaarde is natuurlik dat ons &#x2019;n ordelike, stabiele en regverdige samelewing moet vestig en dat ons die groot en gevaarlike magte wat teen ons werk effektief sal moet teen-staan. Suidelike Afrika het &#x2019;n belangrike konsentrasiepunt van die ideologiese magstryd in die w&#x00EA;reld geword. Dit is onbetwis-baar duidelik dat die Sowjet-Unie vir Suide- like Afrika as van die grootste belang in die bevordering van hul w&#x00EA;reldprogram beskou. Die kommunistiese filosofie teer op en word bevorder deur onstabiliteit en konflik. Die Sowjet-Unie en die Marxisme kan nie sy doelstellings in Afrika bevorder in di&#x00E9; lande waar daar orde, stabiliteit en ekonomiese vooruitgang en voorspoed heers nie en waar die grootste meerderheid van die inwoners gelukkig en tevrede is nie. Dit is &#x2019;n waarheid wat ons goed in gedagte moet hou in Suid-Afrika wanneer ons oor die ekonomie praat.</p>

<p>Die aanvaarding van die beginsels van &#x2019;n vryemark-ekonomie het uiteenlopende gevolge en ek wil vanmiddag net kortliks met enkeles daarvan handel. Dit bring ook mee dat die invoer van goedere en dienste toegelaat moet word om hul rol in die ekonomie te speel. Die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie is relatief klein en die mededinging op sekere terreine is beperk. Invoere kan gevolglik, veral in tydperke waar &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; groeitempo ondervind word of in tydperke van ho&#x00EB; ekonomiese aktiwiteit en van ho&#x00EB; inflasie help om die aanbod van goedere op die plaaslike mark te vergroot. Dit is goed bekend dat die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie in die na-oorlogse jare goed vordering gemaak het met die beleid van invoervervanging en verplasing. Ons het reeds die stadium bereik waar in al die behoeftes wat verbruikersgoe-dere betref, voorsien kan word en waar heel-wat van ons verbruikersgoedere ook uitge-voer kan word. Ongelukkig kan dieselfde nie ges&#x00EA; word sover dit ons behoefte aan kapitaalgoedere soos masjinerie, toerusting en sekere nywerheidsgrondstowwe betref nie. Die rede is hoofsaaklik daarin gele&#x00EB; dat die vervaardiging van sulke goedere gesofistikeerd van aard is en dikwels bedrywe behels wat hoogs kapitaalintensief is en ook &#x2019;n re-delike groot mark verg. Dit regverdig tans nie die ho&#x00EB; kostepremies om sulke bedrywe in Suid-Afrika te vestig nie. Nogtans is daar bemoedigende vordering gemaak met die vestiging van sodanige vervaardigings-bedrywe veral ten opsigte van strategiese nywerhede waardeur die land se weerbaarheid aansienlik verhoog is. Daar word dikwels vrae gestel oor die invoer van goedere in Suid-Afrika en die beleid ten opsigte van invoere, veral met betrekking tot be-skerming van plaaslike nywerhede en ek wil dus graag vanmiddag enkele gedagtes daar-oor uitspreek. Dit is interessant om daarop <span class="col_461-462" refersTo="page_0246"/>te let dat die waarde van invoerpermitte gedurende die eerste sewe maande vanj aar uitgereik 36&#x0025; meer bedrae as die permitwaarde van die ooreenstemmende tydperk verlede jaar.</p>

<p>Anti-inflationary. Aangesien 27&#x0025; van die totale waarde van alle invoerpermitte wat vanjaar toegestaan is egter in die kategorie kapitaalgoedere, masjinerie en toerusting val, terwyl &#x2019;n verdere 44&#x0025; vir grondstowwe, komponente en verbruikbare voorrade vir nywerheidsgebruik bestem is, kan 71&#x0025; van die permitgebonde invoere as in belang van nywerheidsontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika beskou word.&#x2019;n Bykomende 13&#x0025; van permitwaardes was vir die invoer van &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van kommunikasie-en vervoermiddele, d.w.s. vir die bestendiging en uitbouing van ons land se infrastruktuur. Dit kan dus aangevoer word dat 84&#x0025; van die invoerkomponent nodig was vir nywerheidsontwikkeling en vir die skepping van infrastruktuur in Suid-Afrika. Dit was nog altyd die Regeringsbeleid dat invoerbeheer, d.w.s. kwantitatiewe beheer, nie as instrument gebruik moet word om die betalingsbalans te be&#x00EF;nvloed nie en dat in-voerbeheer trouens progressief uitgefaseer moet word. Dit is natuurlik nie maklik om &#x2019;n stelsel wat vir baie jare gegeid het, so maklik uit te skakel nie en ons verkeer dus tans in &#x2019;n oorgangstadium. Dit is ook nie die Regering se beleid om kwantitatiewe invoerbeheer as beskermingsmaatre&#x00EB;l te gebruik vir plaaslike nywerhede nie. Beskerming van nywerhede moet deur invoertariewe geskied en nie deur invoerbeheer nie. Ons het reeds ver gevorder met die implementering van hierdie beleid. Indien die invoer van olie sowel as die invoer van goedere vir die Staat buite rekening gelaat word, is 25&#x0025; van alle invoere reeds geheel en al van permitbeheer vrygestel. In die geval van 70&#x0025; is daar die feitlik outomatiese uitreiking van permitte aangesien in hierdie gevalle aan die volle redelike behoefte van die handel en nywerheid voldoen word. Namate voldoende tariefbe-skerming vir hierdie kommoditeite vasgestel word&#x2014;&#x2019;n proses waarmee die Raad vir Handel en Nywerheid homself ernstig besig hou&#x2014;sal dit ook op die vrye lys geplaas word.</p>

<p>Op die gebied van die intemasionale handel, werk die vryemarkmeganisme nie altyd so dat &#x2019;n mens dit heeltemal sy loop kan laat neem nie. Indien daar volkome vrye handel sou wees, sou Suid-Afrika waarskynlik vandag nog in baie opsigte nog &#x2019;n landbou-en mynbouland gewees het en ook met groot werkloosheids probleme geworstel het. Die basiese argument ten gunste van die beskerming van plaaslike nywerhede het veral ten doel om twee soorte struktuurveranderings teweeg te bring. Dit moet in die eerste instansie aan binnelandse produsente &#x2019;n groter deel van die mark besorg en hulle in staat stel om deur &#x2019;n ekonomie van skaal &#x2019;n produksie-volume te bereik waar die kostepeile aanvaarbaar sal wees. Dit moet hulle ook in staat stel om sekere besparings wat spruit uit faktore soos die beskikbaarheid van &#x2019;n geskoolde werkerskorps, leweransiers, bestuurskennis ensovoorts oor &#x2019;n redelike tyd te bereik. Terwyl dit vir die Staat nodig is en ook die Staat se beleid is om ter wille van beskerming in die vrye handel in te gryp, moet ter wille van die bes moontlike ekonomiese resultate soveel moontlik van die voordele van die markme-ganisme in hierdie gevalle behou word. Daarom verkies die Regering om die beskerming te verleen deur middel van doeanetariewe eerder as deur kwantitatiewe beperkinge, d.w.s. deur invoerbeheer. Tariefbeskerming impliseer ten minste dat die werking van die markmeganisme nog geld ten opsigte van die pryse van ingevoerde produkte. Die markmeganisme geld in di&#x00E9; opsig dat die ingevoerde produk gelaai word met &#x2019;n tarief ten gunste van die produk wat binnelands vervaardig word. Kwantitatiewe beheer, d.w.s. invoerbeheer, skakel die markmeganisme uit en as dit streng genoeg toegepas word, skakel dit ook buitelandse mededinging uit. Dit was nog nooit die bedoeling van ons beleid om alle buitelandse mededinging uit te skakel nie. Trouens, indien dit gedoen sou word, sou die aansporing om ho&#x00EB;r produktiwiteit te behaal&#x2014;waarna die agb. lid vir Bryanston verwys het&#x2014;produkverbetering, tegnologiese innovasie en kosteverlaging nie deur gesonde mededinging bevorder word nie. Ons binnelandse produsent moet ten minste op gelyke voet met die buitelandse invoerder gestel word. Tariefbeskerming maak dus moontlik dat beskerming aan plaaslike nywerhede gegee kan word sonder om die mededingende <span class="col_463-464" refersTo="page_0247"/>voordele van die markmeganisme daar-deur prys te gee. Invoerbeheer darenteen is &#x2019;n arbitr&#x00EA;re stelsel en dit voer &#x2019;n arbitr&#x00EA;re element in die handel in waardeur Rege-ringsvoorskrifte pryspeile bepaal. Die rant-soeneringsfunksie van die prysmeganisme waardeur die aanwending van skaars produksiemiddele bepaal word deur &#x2019;n aanbod van die mees gesogte goedere gaan sodoende verlore. Die resultaat kan wees dat ondoeltreffende bedrywe beskerm word tot nadeel van die ekonomie in sy geheel. Net so kan oormatige tariefbeskerming ook mededinging uitskakel met die gevolglike nadelige uitwerking. Tariefbeskerming as instrument kan egter ten minste fyner aan-gepas word om die voordele van &#x2019;n mededingende situasie nog daar te stel. Dit is egter so&#x2014;en ek het daarna verwys&#x2014;dat Suid-Afrika nie in &#x2019;n normale posisie verkeer nie, maar in sekere opsigte &#x2019;n bedreigde ekonomie is en dat dit ook noodsaaklik is dat die Regering moet toesien dat veral op strategiese gebied nywerhede gevestig word wat ons afhanklikheid van invoere sal verminder en ons in geval van &#x2019;n krisis selfvoorsienend sal maak. Die ho&#x00EB; koste wat dikwels met die daarstelling van sulke nywerhede gepaard gaan, word dikwels oor die langer termyn uitgeskakel. Ek hoef maar net te verwys na die vestiging van die Sasols, die Yskors en die ander bedrywe.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Bedryf wat in hierdie kategorie val en waaroor ek &#x2019;n enkele gedagte wil uitspreek is die Atlantis-dieselenjinprojek en die daarrnee-gepaardgaande plaaslike vervaardiging van ratkaste en agterasse. Die besluit van die Regering om met &#x2019;n dieselmasjien-, ratkas-en agterasprojek voort te gaan is reeds in 1978 geneem nadat die moontlik-heid van &#x2019;n handelsboikot sterk ondersteuning by die WO ontvang het. Die noodsaak-likheid vir die mobiliteit van die Weermag en die Polisie in die tyd van &#x2019;n krisis en die noodsaaklikheid van die handhawing van &#x2019;n goeie infrastruktuur en vervoernetwerk in &#x2019;n noodtoestand in Suid-Afrika het nie verdere motivering nodig nie. Die daarstelling van ADE en die plaaslike vervaardiging van ratkaste en agterasse vloei voort uit daardie strategiese oorweging eerder as uit enige ekonomiese oorweging. Hierdie projekte sal weens die beperkte Suid-Afrikaanse mark en as gevolg van die kapitaalintensiewiteit daarvan &#x2019;n kostepremie vir die volkshuishouding inhou. Ek kan die Komitee egter die verse-kering gee dat daar van owerheidswe&#x00EB; nou-keurig gelet sal word op die doeltreffendheid van die vervaardigingsbedrywe asook op hul produktiwiteit en hul winste. Die tariefbe-skermingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls sal ook gereeld hersien word, maar ek wil egter graag ook die feit in agb. lede se midde l&#x00EA; dat die vestiging van hierdie bedrywe nie sonder baie groot voordele vir die landsekonomie is nie. Sover dit die kostepremies betref, kan dit nie nagelaat word om op verskillende aspekte te wys waaruit die ekonomie in sy geheel groot voordele kan put nie. Die groter strategiese en ekonomiese selfstandigheid wat die land ten opsigte van vragmotors en trekkers daar-deur behaal, is vanselfsprekend. Die groot bydrae tot nuwe tegnologie wat op hierdie wyse tot Suid-Afrika se beskikking gestel word, is van groot belang. Die verbreding van die nywerheidsektor en van die vervaar-digingsbedryf as sulks kan ook na verwys word. Voorts is daar die besparing van bui-telandse valuta en&#x2014;dit is baie belangrik&#x2014;die skepping van werkgeleenthede. Ek verwys nie alleen na die skepping van werkgeleenthede in die vervaardiger se aanleg nie maar ook die kringeffek van werkgeleenthede wat in &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB;r sin vir Suid-Afrika ge-skep word. In hierdie verband sou &#x2019;n mens kon wys op die vervaardigers van onderdele wat direkte voordeel haal uit die vestiging van &#x2019;n industrie waar enjins, ratkaste en agterasse vervaardig word. Vir die verbruiker beteken rasionalisasie en stan-daardisasie laer koste sover dit onderhoud en onderdele betref. Daar het die afgelope jaar of twee gedurig stemme uit die privaatsektor opgegaan toe wesenlike kritiek uitgespreek is oor die daarstelling van die dieselaanleg asook die bedrywe wat verband hou met die vervaardigingsbedryf vir ratkaste en agterasse. In baie gevalle is dit jammer, maar ek moet vanmiddag daarop wys dat persone wat hulle in baie gevalle krities uit-gespreek het oor hierdie besluit van die Regering, verbonde is aan maatskappye wie se tegnologie nie vir die Suid-Afrikaanse Weermag of Polisie beskikbaar was of is nie. Ek wil hulle maan om hul woorde van kritiek versigtig te tel want hierdie besluit was in die eerste instansie &#x2019;n besluit om Suid-Afrika selfvoorsienend te maak in &#x2019;n tyd van krisis. Anders moet ek s&#x00EA; dat daar deurgaans same-werking was tussen die Raad vir Handel en <span class="col_465-466" refersTo="page_0248"/>Nywerheid en my departement asook die motorbedryf. Verskille het van tyd tot tyd ontstaan en in baie gevalle kon tot bevredigende oplossings geraak word. Ek wil dit vanmiddag duidelik stel dat in my same-sprekings met NA AMSA ek nog steeds &#x2019;n goeie gees van samewerking gevind het. Die aard en die vlak van beskerming wat vir die vervaardiging van ratkaste en agterasse aangebied moet word was &#x2019;n aangeleentheid waaroor die Regering en die Raad vir Handel en Nywerheid oor &#x2019;n lang tydperk met die bedryf onderhandel het. Die voorstelle van die raad is nou gefinaliseer en ek sou vanmiddag dit wil vrystel maar ek sou nie graag meer tyd van die Komitee in beslag wil neem om dit hier uit te spel nie. Die inligting word egter vanmiddag vrygestel en ek het dit reeds aan die koerante beskikbaar gestel. Ons betree dus ook &#x2019;n nuwe fase wat hierdie aandryfstelsels betref met die aankondiging dat daadwerklike beskerming ook op hierdie gebied ingestel word.</p>

<p>Voordat ek op enkele sprekers se toesprake antwoord, wil ek graag nog een aspek van die Regering se beskermingsbeleid opper. Die tekstiel-en klerebedryf het oor die afgelope jare by verskeie geleenthede sterk verto&#x00EB; tot die Regering gerig dat sy beleid van tariefbeskerming en die uitfasering van permitbeskerming nie voldoende beskerming aan die tekstiel-en aanverwante bedrywe bied nie. Die bedryf voel verontrus dat hulle in die afwesigheid van invoerbe-heer nie voldoende beskerming teen die uitvoer van ontwikkelende lande sal geniet nie. Soos u weet is hierdie nywerheidsektore groot indiensnemers en hul vrees dat onvoldoende beskerming implikasies vir werkver-skaffmg in Suid-Afrika sal inhou. Die Regering is van mening dat tariefmaatre&#x00EB;ls, soos ek dit so pas uitgespel het, die aangewese metode is om plaaslike fabrikante teen invoere te beskerm. Hierdie maatre&#x00EB;ls is nie prohibitief nie, maar dit is daarop gerig om die pryse van die ingevoerde goedere ten gunste van die plaaslike produkte te verswaar. Die motivering vir hierdie beleid het ek reeds aan die Komitee verduidelik. Die Regering is nogtans bereid om &#x2019;n komitee waarop al die belanghebbende groepe ver teenwoordiging het, aan te stel met di&#x00EB; opdrag om hierdie bedryfstakke te ondersoek en om binne die kortste moontlike tyd daaroor verslag te doen. Oor die opdrag van die Komitee asook die voorsitter en sy lede sal ek hopelik binnekort &#x2019;n verdere aankondiging kan doen.</p>

<p>Ek sal graag wil terugkom op enkele aspekte waaroor agb. lede gepraat het. Ek wil die agb. lid vir Klerksdorp weer eens bedank vir die goeie wense wat hy nie alleen aan my en die Adjunk-minister uitgespreek het nie, maar ook aan dr. Du Plessis wat as Direkteur-generaal van die nuwe departement oorgeneem het toe dit in November verlede jaar tot stand gekom het. Ek kan nie genoeg met hom saamstem dat die klimaat deur die Regering geskep moet word en dat die privaatsektor binne daardie klimaat ook die inisiatief moet neem en self die geleenthede moet benut wat die Regering deur klimaatskepping vir hom moontlik maak. Laat ek eerlik wees: Ek dink ons privaatsektor, veral in die nywerheidswese, maar ook die privaatsektor in die geheel, het in &#x2019;n groot mate daardie geleenthede aangegryp, vandaar die sterk en gesonde ekonomie wat ons in Suid-Afrika het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Amanzimtoti het oor inv voere gepraat en het hom veral uitgespreek oor mededinging. Ek sal nou by sy baksteen probleme kom want hy het na die vraag vir baksten verwys. Ek moet erken dat ek dit moeilik gevind het om te verstaan wat die agb. lid bepleit. Dit was eerder soos &#x2019;n man wat &#x2019;n blom se blare om die beurt uitgepluk het want hy het na &#x201E;control&#x201D; en &#x201E;decontrol&#x201D; om die beurt verwys. Aan die een kant wou hy gehad het dat die groter maat-skappye vasgevat moet word en dat daar beheer moet wees, maar aan die ander kant het hyges&#x00EA; dat dit juis beheer is wat die baksteenbedrff so afrem sodat die investering wat in Suid-Afrika vir hierdie bedryf gemaak moet word nie gemaak word nie. Die agb. lid het bewys dat in 1975 &#x2019;n groter hoogtepunt in Suid-Afrika bereik is wat boubedrywighede betref, as wat in 1980 die geval was. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat daar voorheen &#x2019;n groot oor-skot van bakstene was terwyl daar nou &#x2019;n tekort is en hy het gevra hoe hierdie twee uiterstes rym. Die feit van die saak is dat in die jare wat op 1975 gevolg het, ons &#x2019;n resessie beleef het en in die fase van laagkonjunktuur het bai&#x00E9; van die minder ekonomieskragtige maatskappye gesruit terwyl ander deur groter groepe oorgeneem is. Ek wil die agb. lid egter daarop attent maak dat hoewel van die groter groepe klein maatskappye oorgeneem <span class="col_467-468" refersTo="page_0249"/>het, ons by die berekening van die gevraagde prysverhogings hierdie aspekte wel deeglik in berekening bring of die verkryging van so &#x2019;n maatskappy &#x2019;n voordeel vir die maatskappy inhou. Indien dit die geval sou wees, is daardie voordeel ook aan die verbruiker oorgedra. Dit is &#x2019;n bedryf wat beheer word en aan groot fluktuasies blootgestel is.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Periode van hoogkonjunktuur plaas geweldige druk op die beskikbaarheid van boumateriaal in die besonder, terwyl in &#x2019;n periode van laagkonjunktuur soos ons in die laaste gedeelte van die sewentigerjare deurgemaak het, daar baie min bou-aktiwiteit is. Dit is dus aan geweldige fluktuasies bloot-gestel. Die Regering beheer die pryse en met die vasstelling van die pryse word daar deeglik ingegaan op die rendement van die maatskappye. Daar word baie goed na alle aspekte gekyk. &#x2019;n Laaste opmerking wat ek in die verband wil maak, is dat die Raad op Mededinging tans besig is om na die sementen baksteenbedrywe te kyk en nagaan of daar redes bestaan waarom hierdie bedrywe nog verder aan beheer onderworpe moet wees.</p>

<p>Ek wil terugkom op die vraag wat die agb. lid gestel het ten opsigte van mededinging, waarby hy ook verwys het na die kwessie van monopolie&#x00EB;. In die klomp voorbeelde wat hy probeer aanhaal het, het hy hier gevat en daar gelos. Ek sal nie daarop terugkom nie. Ek het nie altyd die verband tussen hulle gesien nie. Party was al taamlik deur die tyd ingehaal. Dit daar gelaat. Feit is dat die ou monopoliewetgewing, soos die agb. lid ook weet, vervang is deur die wetgewing op mededinging wat in 1979 tot stand gekom het. Waar dit onder die ou bedeling uiters moeilik was om vas te stel wanneer &#x2019;n monopolie nie in die nasionale belang of in landsbelang was nie, het die begrip &#x201E;monopolistiese toestand&#x201D;, soos in die nuwe wetgewing geformuleer, &#x2019;n baie meer direkte en gespesifiseerde betekenis. &#x201E;Monopolistiese toestand&#x201D; word in hierdie wetgewing as &#x2019;n beperkende praktyk gedeflnieer. Die opdrag van die raad is dan om na te gaan in watter mate daar in die ekonomie beperkende [iraktyke in sekere bedryfsektore bestaan. Tussenwerpsels.] Nee, meneer, &#x2019;n verslag van die raad is onlangs ter tafel gel&#x00EA; en daarin word &#x2019;n hele reeks sake waaroor verslag gedoen is, aangestip en word daar ook aangedui watter ander belangrike bedryfstakke die raad tans ondersoek. Ek wil nie die Komitee se tyd mors deur hier uit te spel watter aangeleenthede almal aandag geniet en waaroor daar reeds verslae uitgebring is nie. Ek dink die moeilikheid met die agb. lede is dat hulle nie die verslae lees en nie op die aksies wat geneem word, let nie. Hulle kom praat hier in vae terme, soos die agb. lid vir Yeoville gedoen het. Ek sal nou-nou by daardie agb. lid kom. Daardie manier van optrede dien geen doel nie. Die mededinging is daar en ek wil s&#x00EA; dat ek dit by geleent-heid uitgespel het&#x2014;ek sal later ook daarby kom&#x2014;dat indien die raad nie aan sy doel beantwoord nie, indien sy tande nie skerp genoeg is nie, ek bereid is om na die Raad terug te kom om die tande van die raad te verskerp. Ek hoop dat die agb. lede my dan daarmee sal help.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Vasco het gepraat oor Wes-Kaapland. Die probleme wat hy bespreek het, is probleme waarmee ons vertroud is. Hy, en ook ander agb. lede, het probleme geopper sover dit die agterstand van hul onderskeie gebiede betref. So is daar verwys na Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, Pietermaritzburg en ook ander dele. Ek wil s&#x00EA; dat dit alles deel is van die program waarmee die Regering tans besig is en van die maatre&#x00EB;ls waaraan die Regering oorweging skenk om &#x2019;n beter ekonomiese verspreiding in Suid-Afrika te bewerkstellig. Die voomeme is uitgespreek om op 12 November vanjaar byeen te kom en dit sal sekerlik ook &#x2019;n geleentheid bied om meer duidelikheid te verkry juis o&#x00F6;r aanmoedigingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls in verband met dekonsentrasie en desentralisasie aan die kant van die Regering. Die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes is heeltemal korrek wanneer hy die agb. lid vir Yeoville teregwys. Dit is nou nie net dekonsentrasie nie. Dekonsentrasie het ten doel juis om die oormatige konsentrasie in die metropole te probeer ontmoedig sodat die oorloop in potensi&#x00EB;le stede tereg kan kom. Daar sal in die volgende jare, soos die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes tereg ges&#x00EA; het, tien of meer stede van die grootte van Johannesburg gevestig moet word. Dit doen nie afbreuk aan &#x2019;n beleid van desentralisasie wat gebaseer is op die beter verspreiding van <span class="col_469-470" refersTo="page_0250"/>ekonomiese aktiwiteite ook ten opsigte van die agtergeblewe gebiede nie.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Nee, meneer, die Regering aanvaar dat die desentralisasie &#x2019;n verdere stimulus nodig het, dat daar opnuut gekyk moet word na die jare waarin die huidige desentralisasiemaatre&#x00EB;ls &#x2019;n geleentheid gehad het om hul uitwerking te toon. Dit is dus &#x2019;n belangrike prioriteit om sover dit desentralisasiehulp betref, aan te sluit by die natuurlike ekonomiese kragte wat daar in bepaalde streke van Suid-Afrika is. Die Regering kan nie onbeperk deur middel van sekere maatre&#x00EB;ls die ekonomiese verspreiding in Suid-Afrika bevorder as dit nie aansluit by die natuurlike ekonomiese kragte wat daar aanwesig is nie. Ek kan dus vir die agb. lid vir Vasco s&#x00EA; dat in die geval van die Kaap, soos ook in die geval van Port Elizabeth, die aanwesigheid van &#x2019;n hawe in ag geneem moet word. Die ondersteunende maatre&#x00EB;ls wat die Regering nog deur sy desentralisasiebeleid toepas, sal hy dus graag wil aansluit by die natuurlike tendense om daardie tendense te versterk en uit te bou sodat ons uiteindelik ook &#x2019;n beter ekonomiese verspreiding in Suid-Afrika sal kry. Ek wil &#x2019;n laaste opmerking daaroor maak. Die gedagte van &#x2019;n streeksontwikkelingskomitee sal heel goed inpas by die toekomstige bedeling waarin die aanmoedigingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls van die Regering sekerlik deur die plaaslike gemeenskappe verder gevoer sal moet word. Daar sal dan ruimte wees vir die instel van sulke komitees.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Paarl het &#x2019;n baie insiggewende toespraak gelewer oor nywerheidsbearbeiding, &#x2019;n saak wat my ook interesseer. Daar is in die verlede dikwels die waarskuwing geuiter dat die werker van die kerk wegdrywe. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet ook die ander aspek in ag neem, nl. of die kerk nie dikwels van die werker weg beweeg nie. Die agb. lid het juis ges&#x00EA; dat die kerk ook sy hand moet uitsteek na die arbeider en die geestelike versorging van almal in ons samelewing moet behartig. Dit is &#x2019;n samelewing wat uiteraard vanwe&#x00EB; sy veelsoortigheid en veelkantigheid geweldige inherente kragte en potensiaal vir konflik in hom het. Daarom is die boodskap van vrede en versoening wat op di&#x00E9; wyse ook aan die werker oorgedra word, van groot waarde vir sy eie persoonlike heil maar, glo ek, ook vir die gemeenskap in sy geheel.</p>

<p>Ek het al verwys na die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal. Miskien moet ek in di&#x00E9; verband nog net een of twee ander opmerkinge maak. Hy het hier ges&#x00EA; wat die sakelui eintlik op 12 November moet doen.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that the business leaders in South Africa are quite capable of speaking for themselves. They do not need the hon. member for Port Elizabeth Central to explain to them what they should say to the Prime Minister on 12 November. To reflect now on the occasion of the meeting the hon. the Prime Minister has called for 12 November, to say nothing has happened in the meantime since the Carlton conference, is absurd. Three things were particularly raised on that occasion. The first was the creation of a Small Business Development Corporation. We have gone a long way towards establishing that corporation and I hope to introduce legislation during this session which will enable the Small Business Development Corporation to continue with its work by transferring the assets and liabilities of other corporations, e.g. the Indian Industrial Development Corporation, the Development and Finance Corporation and the IDC, to the Small Business Development Corporation. We have therefore made considerable progress in that respect. That corporation has been launched and it is operative. I hope to be able to say something more about it later on in this debate.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have gone a long way towards establishing a Development Bank.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, mag ek &#x2019;n vraag aan die agb. Minister stel? Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die bates van die NOK oorgeplaas gaan word. Bedoel hy nie dat net &#x2019;n deel daarvan oorgeplaas gaan word nie?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Die deel wat betrekking het op die Klein-nywerheidsektor van die NOK, sal oorgedra word, maar in die geval van die Ontwikkelings-en Finansieringskor-porasie, d.w.s. die vroe&#x00EB;re Kleurling-Ontwikkelingskorporasie, en die Indi&#x00EB;rnywerheidsontwikkelingskorporasie <span class="col_471-472" refersTo="page_0251"/>sal alles aan die Klein-sakeontwikkelingskorporasie oorgedra word.</p>

<p>Then, as I have said, the creation of a Development Bank for South Africa has progressed very far and I think it is time to inform the private sector of the progress made in that respect.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the whole concept of deconcentration and decentralization will at that stage have advanced to a point where it will be possible to furnish more information to the private sector. Therefore, on those three aspects raised at the Carlton conference, substantial progress has been made. I think therefore that it is unfair to create the impression that nothing has happened in the past years. It is very easy for the hon. member and other hon. members to say that they want decentralization and deconcentration, that they want the carrot but not the stick. The hon. member for Johannesburg West pointed out that the stick is not to the detriment of existing business concerns in major metropoles. The aim is to give the new developer an equal opportunity and to remove the disadvantages the new investor might experience in one of these deconcentration points.</p>

<p>Dit is dus om die agterstand te verwyder. Mnr. die Voorsitter, die tyd stap aan. Die agb. lid vir Smithfield het in &#x2019;n baie interessante toespraak gewys op die nadele van die digte konsentrasie in die metropole. Ek glo dat veral ook wat die sosio-ekonomiese aspekte betref, daar heel duidelik groot probleme aan &#x2019;n te ho&#x00EB; ekonomiese konsentrasie verbonde is, alhoewel daar natuurlik aan die ander kant ook ekonomiese voordele aan die groter mark gekoppel is. Die agb. lid het ook verwys na die Bloemfontein-Onverwags-ontwikkeling, asook die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Wes. Aan beide kan ek s&#x00EA; dat dit &#x2019;n saak is wat baie ho&#x00EB; prioriteit geniet en dat die Regering waarskynlik in die nabye toekoms die besonderhede waarna die agb. lid verwys het, sover moontlik bekend sal maak.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid mnr. Schutte het verwys na die bydrae wat &#x2019;n plaaslike gemeenskap soos di&#x00E9; van Pietermaritzburg gemaak het om sy eie gebied te bemark. Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n baie positiewe aspek wat ook as voorbeeld behoort te dien vir ander plaaslike besture en gemeenskappe. Hulle kan hul eie voordele bekendstel. Dikwels vind daar geen ontwikkeling in &#x2019;n gebied plaas nie omdat die voornemende belegger, die nyweraar, nie bewus is van die voordele van die bepaalde gebied nie.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville raised three issues, and I do not want to quarrel with him on them. The first was the exploitation of consumers. We are <i>ad idem</i> with him that this subject should receive the necessary attention. I shall come back to this point. The second issue was the creation of an economic policy which will be an alternative to Marxism. His third point concerned the creation of jobs. The fact is that the best protection for the consumer lies in a healthy competitive market.</p>

<p>The Competition Board is there to see that the market in South Africa will be competitive. Should there then be areas about which the hon. member is particularly concerned, he can request the board to launch an investigation into those specific areas. [Interjections.] Let me continue, Sir. There are many other mechanisms, for example legislation, that are specifically aimed at consumer protection. Let me quickly run through them. There is the Price Control Act with its price control inspectorate throughout the country. That is consumer protection. There is the Trade Practices Act which deals with misleading advertising, the issuing of trade coupons, etc.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, the hon. member carried on in vague terms. If he has any specific probleem falling under one of these Acts which are administered by my department, I will certainly take it up. Let him then raise particular aspects. Then there is the Credit Agreements Act which deals with all credit transactions and which protects the consumer. There is the Sale of Land on Instalments Act, there is the Share <span class="col_473-474" refersTo="page_0252"/>Blocks Control Act, the Estate Agents Act and the Trade Metrology Act. All these Acts are aimed at protecting the consumer.</p>

<p>Ek wil &#x2019;n verdere opmerking maak. Die agb. lid vir Yeoville en ook ander agb. lede kan hulle baie popul&#x00EA;r voorstel deur hier te kom praat namens die verbruiker asof daar in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n totale uitbuiting van die verbruiker bestaan. Ek het na &#x2019;n hele reeks wette verwys wat, so glo ek, in groot mate effektief is. Daar is altyd leemtes wat reggestel kan word, maar ons in Suid-Afrika moet daarteen waak dat politici rondgaan en die indruk skep dat maatskappye wat winste maak, uit die bose is, dat winste verdag is. As ons private inisiatief op daardie wyse gaan doodpraat, sal ons nie in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n ekonomiese bestel vestig wat inderdaad werkgeleenthede sal skep en die gehalte van die lewe van mense sal verbeter nie.</p>

<p>Sien u, Meneer! Daar het &#x2019;n mens die hele verkeerde en gevaarlike konnotasie wat deur die agb. lid aan ver-bruikersbeskerming gegee word: Dit is die rykes wat die armes uitbuit. Daar word nie gewys op die gesonde ekonomiese bestel wat op private inisiatief rus wat juis die ekonomiese groeikrag in Suid-Afrika skep wat werkgeleenthede voorsien en ons in die bre&#x00EB; ekonomies sterk en lewenskragtig maak nie. Ek is jammer dat die agb. lid daardie benadering geopenbaar het. Ek dink dit is ongelukkig en dit spel niks goeds vir Suid-Afrika as mense so &#x2019;n houding teenoor die ekonomie inneem nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes het oor desentralisasie gepraat en die noodsaaklikheid daarvan dat daar nuwe dekonsentrasiepunte geskep word sonder om die bestaande metropole te knel. Ek gaan heeltemal akkoord met sy siening. Op die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Bloemfontein-Wes het ek reeds geantwoord.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Umbilo het verwys na die &#x201C;de-regulating of the economy&#x201D;. Daarmee is ons besig. Ek kan vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat my departement opdrag het om vas te stel in watter mate ons onnodige administratiewe re&#x00EB;lings kan verwyder en die ekonomie kan stroomlyn. Dit is egter nie so &#x2019;n eenvoudige saak nie. Dit help ook nie om hier op beperkinge of regulasies te wys wat eintlik by die provinsiale raad tuishoort nie. As die agb. lid my of my departement oor spe-sifieke sake wil nader, sal ons dit waardeer. Dit is ons voorneme en ons deurlopende taak om te kyk watter maatre&#x00EB;ls ons kan vereenvoudig juis om die ekonomie te stroomlyn.</p>

<p>Met hierdie paar opmerkings wil ek volstaan. Alhoewel dit &#x2019;n ekonomiese debat is hierdie waarin ons wye politieke draaie geloop het, glo ek dat die gebrek aan kritiek van die kant van die Opposisie teen ons nywerheidsbeleid daarvan getuig dat hulle eintlik min te s&#x00EA; het oor die gesonde basis waarop die nywerheid en handel in Suid-Afrika tans staan. Ek wil hulle die versekering gee dat, nieteenstaande hul treurmares, die Regering sal voortgaan om die gesonde klimaat te waarbinne die handel en nywerheid in Suid-Afrika kan bloei.</p>

The hon. the Minister was cautious. He looked like a politician who, having lost one election and going into another, was going to make very sure that he was not going to make a mistake. He went out of his way to be careful. He did not deal with the very specific points made by the hon. members for Bryanston and Port Elizabeth Central.

<p>What is apartheid?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Apartheid is the Group Areas Act; it is denying people the right to own property; it is denying them public sector employment. The hon. the Minister evaded that point.</p>

<p>When it comes to the general platitudes about the economic system, we have no complaints about what he said. At one stage I thought I was listening to a Prog. He described the economic system we have in South Africa as a mixed system, and this is what we have been saying for years. We have been saying that we have to realize in this country that on the one hand we have the private enterprise factor which provides the entrepreneurial spirit and the thrust for development, and that on the other hand we have the State factor which has to provide the infrastructure and some of the development programmes and which also has to be there to prevent exploitation. It is a marriage between the two systems. That is what it is and that is what we have been saying.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister was speaking of a &#x201C;gemengde sisteem&#x201D;, a mixed economy, he created the impression that he was saying: &#x201C;Apartheid for some and free enterprise for others.&#x201D; Is that what he was saying? These were the points raised by hon. members on this side and the Government has to face this, not only because apartheid and free enterprise are incompatable, but also for another reason raised by the hon. member for Yeoville viz., that Black and Brown people in South Africa are today in the process of looking for an economic system in which they can believe. Every time the Government says &#x201C;Our system is the free enterprise system&#x201D; and then practises apartheid or discrimination, it debases the free economic system in the eyes of Black and Brown South Africans. That is the responsibility which rests on the shoulders of the Government. We ask the hon. the Minister to clarify his thinking and to clarify the Government&#x2019;s point of view in respect of apartheid operating against the background of the free enterprise system in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in the few minutes at my disposal I want to shift the attention of the Committee and the hon. the Minister to a different aspect of economic planning. This hinges on the fact that we live in a fascinating society which is partly developed and partly under-developed. We have a highly sophisticated technologically orientated economic system called a First World economy operating side by side with an unstructured, non-technological Third World economy. It is quite understandable that the thrust of our economic development is and should be in the direction of what I shall call the First World economic system, our modern economic system. It is by all standards more productive and more orderly and it sets standards of excellence which are desirable goals. That should be the thrust. However, it also has certain drawbacks. When looking at South Africa as a whole with its mixed population. This First World system is capital-intensive, it requires a work-force with formally acquired skills and expertise, its relevance tends to be measured in economic rather than social terms and very often it reinforces the class division between the employer and the employee. These are the practical drawbacks of what is otherwise a highly efficient economic system.</p>

<p>I believe that, looking at the social development of South Africa, we should not ignore the Third World factor which is part of our economy and which can be stimulated to play a much more important part in our economic development in the future. I believe that, if we look in a positive way at this Third World factor, this unrecorded, <span class="col_477-478" refersTo="page_0254"/>less sophisticated and informal factor in our economy, we can see that it has a very specific role to play in the total economic upliftment of our people and particularly in the homelands and rural areas where there is going to have to be a greater concentration of the population in small towns and villages, and in those areas of the country where people are in the process of urbanization. This sector can create certain economic advantages. It can bring into the area of economic activity many people who do not have access to capital. Surely this in itself is a desirable thing. Secondly, it can harness the talents of and provide employment for people who do not have formal skills or formal expertise. It can encourage the economic activity which is socially relevant, even though economically it may not be quite as efficient. Finally, by means of it, we can shift many people as rapidly as possible in South Africa from the employee/worker class to the entrepreneur/employer class. This is a very desirable goal.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, looking at our economy as a whole, I think we should not see it only in terms of the formal First World factor but that we should also, as a specific matter of policy, look at the informal and unrecorded Third World factor in our economy. All the indications are that this is already a very important part of our economy. The Free Market Foundation estimates that in Ciskei half of the households already have unrecorded employment and that this income amounts to between 50&#x0025; and 100&#x0025; of the income from recorded employment. The kwaZulu Development Corporation estimates that at least 60 000 jobs are held in kwaZulu by people in the unrecorded sector. In the townships, in Crossroads, Langa and Soweto, there is already the basis of an unrecorded, informal economy which cannot be ignored, nor should it be denied. In fact, even in sophisticated countries like the USA it is estimated that between 20&#x0025; and 30&#x0025; of the gross domestic product comes from the informal sector, let alone in a country like Italy, which for different reasons, has an informal sector approaching 40&#x0025; of the gross domestic product. Generally, in developing countries approximately 50&#x0025; of the gross domestic product can come from the informal sector of the economy.</p>

<p>If we are going to develop the informal sector of our economy, we have to look at how and where this element can be stimulated. Quite clearly, one of the key factors mitigating against the effective use of this element of our economy is the mass of highly technical regulations which are geared to First World requirements and which ignore the realities of a Third World situation. I know that the hon. the Minister is moving away from that, but I think it must be undertaken as a very specific part of Government policy. How should it be done? It should be done, first of all, by identifying areas, regions or places where excessive regulations are unnecessary. Some people call these areas &#x201C;enterprise zones&#x201D;. Surely, in rural areas where the population has little or no access to capital there should be massive deregulation so that people can in fact become involved in an informal private enterprise structure. Secondly, it should be applied in the urban areas where the process of urbanization is taking place. Research undertaken by the ILO in Third World countries has indicated that the exodus of people from the rural areas to the urban areas is continuing even though employment opportunities do not exist. Yet these people do not die. They join the informal sector and provide services which are required by the community. In other words, the informal sector provides a safety valve for employment and it provides employment for those people who cannot, for a variety of reasons, find employment in the formal sector.</p>

<p>I believe that we are a society in the process of transition. It is no use for us to think of ourselves as all belonging to the modem, sophisticated, technologically orientated economic system. Many of our people do not belong to that. I believe we must first of all identify the areas or zones involved. Secondly, we must define the areas of economic activity which are specially suited to de-regulation. These must be areas of activity in which particularly the lower income groups spend a large amount of their income. I want to identify three such areas. The first is transportation. Black and Coloured people are spending a big part of their income on transportation. Yet we have a highly regulated transportation system in South Africa. Elsewhere in Africa the transportation systems may be less efficient than ours, but hon. members should see the bush <span class="col_479-480" refersTo="page_0255"/>taxi&#x2019;s, the mammy waggons and the matadi&#x2019;s in use there.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. member for the opportunity. In the few minutes available to me, may I just round off what I was saying, namely that the informal, or unrecorded Third World sector of our economy should be encouraged. It should be seen first of all in areas, rural areas and areas in the industrial world where people are in the process of transition to our modem economy. It should also take into account certain fields of activity. I have identified transportation as one of them. The second one is the field of housing. There is no doubt that there is a tremendous field for informal activity in the housing sector, if in fact this whole housing sector were deregulated. Already there are practical examples where this is taking place, like Nortons in the Ciskei and Khutsong, outside Carletonville.</p>

<p>The final one is in the field of trading, especially in the provision of necessary services and goods of a household nature, such as foods, clothing, furniture, and all those things related to the ordinary, daily living in a household. Many of these services could be supplied on an informal basis, if only there was massive deregulation. It is estimated that if a person in Lebowa should want to go in for trading, he would have to comply with 36 different laws before he could get that trading licence. It is estimated that a Soweto industrialist, operating in a backyard in Soweto, is in fact operating in conflict with at least 20 laws. These people are all there. They have a service to provide.</p>

<p>We do not suggest a total abolition of this control, but we do suggest that a new look be taken at the regulations in these particular areas. We believe that the informal, unstructured, unrecorded sector could be a valuable adjunct to the recorded, formal sector. We are not suggesting that the emphasis be shifted, but we believe that by introducing ordinary people, without capital and without skills, but with a certain ability, into the economic life of the Third World, unrecorded sector, their sophistication and capital accumulation will gradually increase to a point where they will be grafted onto the formal sector and play a full role in the economic development of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil kortliks verwys na &#x2019;n paar van die stellings wat die agb. lid vir Seepunt gemaak het. Ek het groot begrip vir sy neiging om werkgeleenthede en bestaansmoontlikhede te skep, maar hy het onder andere verwys na die voorbeeld van die &#x201E;bos-taxis&#x201D; in Afrika. Dit is die eerste keer dat ek hoor dat na Afrika, wat &#x2019;n blatante voorbeeld van stagnasie en ekonomiese mislukking is, verwys word as &#x2019;n voorbeeld in hierdie verband. Die agb. lid het hom ook weer eens laat verlei om ideologie by te sleep, en hy het dit heel blatant uitgespel dat groepsge-biede nie versoenbaar is met ontwikkeling nie. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het dit ook gedoen. Di&#x00E9; mense se vooroordele teen nasionaal-geori&#x00EB;nteerde ideologiese beginsels maak hulle normaalweg blind vir die werklike, harde realiteite. Ek is jammer dat die agb. lid vir Yeoville nie op die oomblik hier is nie, want dit sou interessant wees om te weet of hy en die agb. lid vir Seepunt saamstem oor die kwessie van deregulasie. Soos ek die agb. lid vir Yeoville ken, is hy &#x2019;n man wat nogal hou van regulering tot &#x2019;n groot hoogte. Ek wil daardie kwessie egter daar laat.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Yeoville het hom in &#x2019;n stadium ook redelik sterk uitgelaat oor die uitbuiting van die verbruiker. Ek wil die agb. Minister nie teengaan nie, of met hom verskil nie, maar sonder om met hom te verskil, wil ek aan die agb. lid vir Yeoville s&#x00EA; ek is dit met hom roerend eens. Ek is dit met hom roerend eens dat daar nie uitbuiting van die verbruiker moet wees nie. Ek is dit ook met hom eens dat instellings, soos die banke, byvoorbeeld, nie kli&#x00EB;nte moet uitbuit met t&#x00E9; ho&#x00EB; finansieringskoste nie. Ek dink die agb. lid vir Yeoville het groot begrip vir wat ek nou s&#x00EA;. U weet, Meneer, dit is &#x2019;n geheimpie wat hy en die Minister van Onderwys en <span class="col_481-482" refersTo="page_0256"/>Opleiding met mekaar deel. Ek laat dit egter daar.</p>

<p>Suid-Afrika besit al die komponente om &#x2019;n groot nywerheidsland te word, maar Suid-Afrika het ook eiesoortige probleme wat dit beslis moeiliker maak as vir die gevestigde nywerheidslande in hul ontwikkelingsfases. Dit is net so dat moderne kommunikasiemiddels die w&#x00EA;reld klein gemaak het, en ons blootstel aan die invloed van arbeids-en loonpraktyke en kodes wat in ander lande na eeue se ekonomiese ontwikkeling te berde gekom het. Nou is dit so dat, as gevolg van hul vooroordele, hulle heeltemal onoordeelkundig wil h&#x00EA; dat hierdie praktyke en kodes net so in Suid-Afrika van toepassing gemaak moet word, ten spyte van die feit dat ons in Suid-Afrika te doen het met &#x2019;n groot deel van ons arbeidsmag wat tot die Derde W&#x00EA;reld behoort, vir wie dit in elk geval &#x2019;n traumatiese ervaring is om aan te pas by die eise van die tegnologiese eeu.</p>

<p>Dit, Meneer, bring my by die ander probleem wat ons in Suid-Afrika het, naamlik dat ons te doen gehad het met &#x2019;n klein, Eerstew&#x00EA;reldse werkerskorps, wat goed ontwikkel en goed opgelei was, terwyl ons terself-dertyd te doen gehad het met &#x2019;n baie groter Derdew&#x00EA;reld-werkerskorps wat mank gegaan het aan opleiding en ontwikkeling. Ons het dus hier te doen gehad met &#x2019;n histories veroorsaakte situasie, dat die kleiner bron tot onlangs alleen die meer geskoolde mannekrag verskaf het. Afgesien van die inherente vermo&#x00EB;ns en ontwikkelings-en opleidingspeile, is hierdie toestand hoofsaaklik as gevolg van werkersweerstand deur kunsmatige maatre&#x00EB;ls verleng. En laat ons dit erken&#x2014;dit het gelei tot wanbalanse.</p>

<p>Algemeen word aanvaar dat loonskale deur &#x2019;n verskeidenheid faktore be&#x00EF;nvloed en bewerkstellig word. Al die belangrikste gesaghebbendes stem egter saam dat die belangrikste van hierdie faktore die eeueoue ekonomiese wet van vraag en aanbod is. Met as agtergrond die historiese en in samehang daarmee die kunsmatige wering van werkers uit die groter bron, het die toestand ontstaan dat in die laer kaders van die meer gesofistikeerde werkkategorie&#x00EB; oor lang periodes &#x2019;n groot aanvraag met &#x2019;n konstante klein aanbod was. Dit het die toestand laat ontstaan wat in die ou nywerheidslande bekend geword het as &#x201E;jobs chasing men&#x201D; in plaas van die ideale posisie van &#x201E;men chasing jobs&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Deskundiges in loonfilosofie dwarsoor die w&#x00E9;reld stem saam dat dit een van die belangrikste oorsake van onrealisties ho&#x00EB; loon-peile is. Selfs Rusland&#x2014;glo dit as u wil, Meneer&#x2014;was in die twee dekades van 1930 tot 1950 onderhewig aan hierdie ongesonde toestand, as gevolg van groot ekonomiese ontwikkeling in daardie stadium in Rusland, met die tipiese gevolge daaraan verbonde, naamlik eskalerende inflasie.</p>

<p>Ek het nou gepraat van lande met groot bevolkings wat homogeen is en glad nie die probleemkwaliteite van die Suid-Afrikaanse bevolkingsamestelling het nie. Dit impliseer dat die probleem hier selfs groter afmetings aangeneem het, met die uitvloeisel dat werkgewers teen die Staat en teen mekaar begin bie het vir die dienste van sekere kategorie&#x00EB; werkers. Dit het ontaard tot &#x2019;n byna volskaalse loonoorlog. Ek wil aanhaal wat &#x2019;n baie gesaghebbende instansie in verband met hierdie aangeleentheid, naamlik die American Assembly, hieroor te s&#x00EA; gehad het. Hierdie mening loop soos &#x2019;n goue draad deur die mening van alle deskundiges op hierdie gebied. Dit is wat hulle s&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A wage war will usually not be to the advantage of anyone.</block>

<p>Dit was helaas ook die geval in Suid-Afrika. Lone in die genoemde werkkategorie&#x00EB; het ongesond en onrealisties gestyg oor &#x2019;n relatief lang periode. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het&#x2014;en ek wil dit baie duidelik stel&#x2014;praat ek hier van die laer kaders van die meer gesofistikeerde werkkategorie&#x00EB;, daardie kategorie&#x00EB; waartoe die volgende laer kategorie&#x00EB; werkers, hulle toegang sal moet vind, in die normale proses. Ek wil dit baie duidelik stel dat ek onder geen omstandighede impliseer dat loonpeile van die werkers oor die algemeen in Suid-Afrika te hoog is nie, maar slegs in hierdie besondere kader. Dit het die kompetisie-drukelement as insentief by werknemers ge&#x00EB;limineer, met die daarmee gepaard-gaande en noodwendige inflasion&#x00EA;re eskalasie.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander belangrike newe-effek was dat dit die aanvaarding van t&#x00E9; ho&#x00EB; kunsmatige lewenstandaarde gangbaar gemaak en bestendig het. Dit is heel menslik, onder sulke omstandighede. Selfs in die dae van Ryk <span class="col_483-484" refersTo="page_0257"/>Tulbagh, moes hy van sy prag-en praalwette gebruik maak om hierdie soort euwel te bekamp.</p>

<p>Wat ek wil noem ons dilemma in hierdie verband, is die feit dat loonverhogings hoegenaamd nie gepaard gegaan het met &#x2019;n verhoging in produktiwiteit nie. &#x201E;Produktiwiteit&#x201D; is natuurlik die een woord wat vir omtrent elke mens &#x2019;n ander betekenis het, maar ek wil nie daarop uitwei nie; ek het nie die tyd nie. Dit is baie moeilik versoenbare begrippe, want dit is so dat die werknemer, sowel as die werkgewer, eintlik nie die beginsel aanvaar van &#x2019;n korrelasie tussen produktiwiteit en loonskale nie, want as die werker hierdie beginsel aanvaar, dan beteken dit dat hy aanvaar dat die verdeling van inkomste op daardie stadium regverdig en billik is&#x2014;en dit is hy nooit bereid om te aanvaar nie.</p>

<p>Afgesien van hierdie oorwegings, is dit &#x2019;n feit dat die wanverhouding tussen aanvraag en aanbod die werkgewers in &#x2019;n swak bedingingsposisie geplaas het. Feit is egter dat &#x2019;n wanbalans ontwikkel het tussen produktiwiteit en loonpeile, met gepaardgaande kunsmatige ho&#x00EB; lewenstandaarde, wat in enige land probleme skep, maar in Suid-Afrika nog te meer so. Ek wil nou een hiervan noem.</p>

<p>Hier bestaan &#x2019;n onwenslike groot gaping tussen lone, wat verswaar word deur die feit dat dit etnies gekorreleerd is. Uit hoofde van ons situasie is dit &#x2019;n histories gefundeerde toestand, waarvoor die Regering nie alleen geblameer kan word nie. Trouens, hierdie Regering is die enigste wat iets gedoen het ten opsigte van die sinvolle regstelling van hierdie situasie. Maar, Meneer, die regstelling word oneindig gekompliseer en bemoei-lik deur die bestaande wanbalans wat ek genoem het. Die dilemma is dat die bestaande lone in die betrekke werkkategorie&#x00EB; vanselfsprekend deur nuwe werkers aanvaar word as die maatstaaf of kriterium vir hulle loonpeile vorentoe. Dit impliseer dat ons baie omsigtig moet handel met die sogenaamde vemouing van die loongaping, sodat bestaande wanbalanse nie permanente beslag kry nie.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek kan vir u s&#x00EA; dat bevriende buitelandse beleggers met belange hier, en moontlike belange in die toekoms, bekommerd is&#x2014;en daarvan het ek getuienis&#x2014;dat juis hierdie proses uiteindelik die wanbalans in Suid-Afrika kan bestendig en permanen-sie gee, tot die ekonomiese nadeel van Suid-Afrika, wat &#x2019;n baie sterk demper op sy groei sal plaas en wat vir hom in die baie sterk mededingende internasionale mark &#x2019;n baie moeilike posisie sal besorg.</p>

<p>Dit impliseer vir my dat hierdie Minister en sy Departement&#x2014;en hulle is uitnemend geskik hiervoor&#x2014;met ander relevante departemente &#x2019;n enorme opvoedings-en oorredingstaak in Suid-Afrika het ten opsigte van die werkgewers, enersyds, wat eintlik binne die invloedsfeer van hierdie Minister val, en ook die werknemers andersyds. Hulle sal moet poog om &#x2019;n sinvolle balans te vind tussen produktiwiteit en loonskale. Anders, soos ek reeds ges&#x00EA; het, gaan Suid-Afrika se kompetisiewaardigheid in &#x2019;n hoogs mededingende w&#x00EA;reldmark ernstig in die gedrang kom. [Tyd verstreke]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Sea Point, who spoke earlier, dealt in the last few minutes of his speech with the informal sector of industry. This is a matter which I raised in the Other Place during an earlier debate this year. While I did not hear the earlier part of the hon. member for Sea Point&#x2019;s speech today, a significant interjection was made by a Deputy Minister on that occasion. When I was dealing with the question of the back-yard, or back-room industry, and thinking in terms of people such as the component part maker, the person who is contributing to the economy in an informal way, the answer was: &#x201C;But he hasn&#x2019;t got a licence.&#x201D; This &#x201C;Did you get a licence?&#x201D; approach is one of the things that I believe hampers the exploitation of a large potential in South Africa&#x2019;s economic development. The hon. the Minister complained that my colleague, the hon. member for Amanzimtoti, had spoken in &#x201C;vae terme&#x201D;, in vague terms. I want to talk in detailed terms tonight of what I believe is this Government&#x2019;s absolute obsession that everything must happen according to a firm set of inflexible rules from which there must be no deviation. As a result of this it is preventing the development of a great deal of potential industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to tell the saga of a person who was prepared to invest R150 000 in order to produce a product which was desperately needed in his area. It was a product that <span class="col_485-486" refersTo="page_0258"/>both my colleagues spoke about earlier, namely bricks. The absence of bricks is preventing the building of homes, is preventing jobs being created, and is preventing houses being built for people to live in. Because there was a tremendous shortage of bricks in this particular area, this potential entrepreneur, who was a fanner a few miles out of the town, decided that he would make bricks on a piece of ground on his farm. He applied for the necessary permission, and of course, when you apply, you have to apply in triplicate or quintuplicate. He applied to this Department, he applied to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Department, and he applied to the Department of Manpower Utilization. He did all the other things that one has to do. I have all the forms here, and I can tell you that merely to wade through one of these forms is quite an exercise. Nevertheless, he went through the correct channels and applied. The answer, in due course, came back. He applied in August 1980 and it did not take long to get that answer. This was that his application had been refused. He was told that he would have to produce bricks in a proclaimed industrial area. In his application he had set aside R30 000 for ground and R120 000 for plant. The answer of the Department was: &#x201C;No, you cannot produce concrete bricks on your farm. You must go into an industrial area&#x201D;. This man was going to produce bricks made from ash from a mine-dump outside the town, which he would then have had to cart four kilometres to his property &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>All right, let us split the difference and say four and a half kilometres. The actual distance is four and a half kilometres. The Government adds a half, and I took off a half, so I shall grant the Minister his figure of five, although it is really four and a half kilometres. The quantity of ash which this person would have had to cart per day was 500 tons, or 50 loads. He would have had to cart the 50 loads of ash to his plant, and the finished bricks to the market. But the Government said: &#x201C;Oh no, you cannot do that&#x201D;, because the ash dump happened to be on his side of the village. They said: &#x201C;You must go and get land in the industrial township, and you must cart this ash all the way through the village, over a distance of nine kilometres, to the industrial site, blowing dust all over the village in the process. Then you must cart your finished product back, along the same route&#x201D;. It worked out that just on conveying ash he would be travelling an extra nine kilometres per day times 50 loads. That is 450 kilometres per day extra. I listened to the Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the Minister of Energy, and I have listened to this Minister pleading for the saving of fuel in South Africa. I have heard other Ministers pleading for conservation; but no, you cannot make a simple thing like concrete bricks on your farm. You have to go into a proclaimed township. These figures I have mentioned exclude the carting of the finished product, of course.</p>

<p>Then this person applied, in February, to the municipality for the 12 hectares of land he needed. This is a long story and I do not have the time to tell it in detail, but eventually they said they could let him have five hectares of land, although he wanted 12. The minimum he could operate on was really seven hectares. He has to pay R180 000 for the five hectares, more than the total investment in land and plant which he had had available. Now, what does this mean, Mr. Chairman? It means that because of the rules and regulations a man on a farm, where he is not hurting anyone, where there is no environmental probleem, cannot produce a product which is desperately needed, with the advantage of being able to produce it more cheaply, in order to protect the vested interests of people who are charging more for bricks. This will mean that houses will cost more and that people will have to pay higher rentals. He cannot take advantage of the opportunity to conserve fuel. And what is this all for? I would like to ask the hon. the Minister: How many letters are there in that file from the local municipality? And why has the local municipality taken that line? I can understand his competitor objecting because he is going to be in competition, but I thought this hon. Minister believed in free enterprise. I thought he believed in competition. Here was an opportunity for somebody to compete, and to produce a vital requirement more cheaply. However, he was thwarted by the protection of vested interests. I wonder who the vested <span class="col_487-488" refersTo="page_0259"/>interests are. I wonder what his politics are and what the politics of the applicant are. I would like to know why one finds this blank wall. From August last year to August 1981 there was a whole year of negotiation. It took three or four months to try to get some land in the industrial township. And then this Government talks about encouraging industrial development! It talks about encouraging job opportunities! This is a man who this year has built 12 houses for his own staff. He has been producing bricks; he sold some illegally until he was told that it was illegal. Now he is producing them for his own use. Is this Minister going to stop him? He is going to build another 21 houses for his own labour on his own farms. Is this Minister going to stop that, and say that he may not make bricks for his own labourers? Sir, if you can make bricks for your own use, why should competition be prevented? Another firm has now moved into the town, all the way from Johannesburg&#x2014;one of the big concerns, because this is a nice, protected market. I want to know how one can reconcile this with a commitment to expanding industry through private enterprise. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. E. NOTHNAGEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, wanneer &#x2019;n mens aan &#x2019;n debat oor ekonomiese sake deelneem, vra jy jou-self net een vraag af: Wat wil ons in Suid-Afrika bereik? Ons wil &#x2019;n sterk ekonomie as grondslag h&#x00EA; om die bre&#x00EB; sosio-ekonomiese probleematiek in hierdie mooi land van ons te hanteer, om stabiliteit te bewerkstellig, om orde te kry, tesame met al die ander mooi dinge waaroor ons almal so dikwels praat. Dit is omdat ek daarin glo dat die vryemark-stelsel, die kapitalistiese stelsel, die basis is waardeur alles gedoen moet word dat ek graag vanaand aan die agb. Minister &#x2019;n pertinente vraag wil vra. Ek vra dit in die gees van die agb. Eerste Minister se standpunt dat ons in Suid-Afrika die privaatsektor moet stimuleer. Ek vra dit in die gees van die Kabinet se standpunt dat die klein sakeman in hierdie land gehelp moet word. Ek vra dit in die gees van ons as Nasionale Party se standpunt dat in die vryemarkstelsel ons toekomsheil op ekonomiese en baie ander terreine l&#x00EA;, naas ons geloof. Ek wil die agb. Minister graag vanaand vra dat die Staande Advieskomitee teen Staatsmededinging, &#x2019;n komitee wat eintlik nie in Suid-Afrika bekend is nie, nie net bekend gemaak moet word nie, maar ook tande gegee moet word. Ek wil vra dat hierdie komitee werklik tande sal kry, dat hy slagtande sal kry, en dat hierdie tande diep aan die wortel van die probleem in Suid-Afrika ingeslaan sal word. Ek dra in my hart die absolute oortuiging dat ons in Suid-Afrika, ten spyte van al ons idealistiese beskouinge oor die toekoms, met betrekking tot ons ekonomie en dus ook met betrekking tot ons landstoekoms, op &#x2019;n paar plekke sodanig die bal misslaan dat ons die gevaar loop om onsself en ons land se ekonomie te vermink. Dit is in daardie gees dat ek vanaand vir die agb. Minister wil vra dat daardie Staande Advieskomitee teen Staatsmededinging in die privaatsektor tande moet kry.</p>

<p>Ek wil dit graag illustreer aan die hand van &#x2019;n paar syfers. Die totale aantal werkgeleenthede in Suid-Afrika in die derde kwartaal van 1980, met ander woorde die getal ekonomies bedrywige mense, was 4 938 767. Van hierdie mense was 6,6&#x0025; in diens van die Sentrale Regering, 5&#x0025; in diens van die Provinsiale Administrasies, 1,7&#x0025; in diens van die Swart nasionale state, 4,6&#x0025; in diens van die plaaslike besture, 5,4&#x0025; in diens van die Spoorwe&#x00EB; en Hawens, 1,5&#x0025; in diens van die Poskantoor, 3,2&#x0025; in diens van die openbare korporasies, en 0,5&#x0025; in diens van diverse statut&#x00EA;re liggame. In die besigheidsektor se hande was 71,5&#x0025; van die ekonomie. Dit, Meneer, harmonieer met ekonomie&#x00EB; soos di&#x00E9; in Duitsland en Amerika, waar ongeveer 30&#x0025; van die aktiwiteite in die land se ekonomie in die hande van die ower-heidsektor in die geheel is, maar as daar een land in die w&#x00EA;reld is waar die vryemarkstelsel maksimaal benut moet word, dan is dit hierdie land. As ons nie die produksiefak-tore in ons ekonomiese stelsel, naamlik man-nekrag, kapitaal, ondernemerskap en grondstowwe jaar in en jaar uit en dag in en dag uit maksimaal kan benut nie, dan, so seker as wat ons vanaand in hierdie Raad sit, stuur hierdie land uiteindelik op ekonomiese ellende af. Dink net daaraan, Meneer: Agt-en-veertig persent van die Swart bevolking in Suid-Afrika is onder 15 jaar oud. Wat beteken dit in terme van ekonomiese ontwikkeling? 350 000 Werkgeleenthede moet per jaar vir die Swart mense geskep word. As daar mense in Suid-Afrika is wat dink dat <span class="col_489-490" refersTo="page_0260"/>ons hierdie probleematiek kan ondervang en dat ons anderkant kan uitkom met 30&#x0025; van ons land se ekonomiese bedrywighede in die hande van die owerheidsektor, dan vrees ek dat ek, in groot beskeidenheid, nie kan saamstem nie. Ek wil vra dat ons indringend hierna moet kyk, want ek glo ons moet daar-die 30&#x0025; so min as moontlik maak. As ons dit s&#x00EA;, dan moet ons as Regering, wat my betref, en in die gees van die Regering se huidige standpunt revolusion&#x00EA;re besluite neem. As daar mense is wat meen dat die besluite op hierdie terrein oor die volgende paar jaar geneem kan word waarvolgens hierdie aangeleentheid gehanteer moet word, dan is ek bevrees dat ek nie daarmee kan saamstem nie. Ons het werklik revolusion&#x00EA;re besluite nodig.</p>

<p>Nou, Meneer, wat maak daardie revolusion&#x00EA;re besluite? Dit raak aan goed waarvan ons nie hou om aan te raak nie. Kom ons s&#x00EA; dit vir mekaar reguit: As ons ons ekonomie maksimaal wil stimuleer, dan moet ons die gees en die gesindheid van koninkrykies bou uit ons sisteem kry. As ons ons ekonomie maksimaal wil benut, dan moet ons daardie gees van koninkrykies wil bou en &#x2019;n burokra-sie te wil laat groei en te laat groei, eenvoudig net kort vat. Dit is in daardie gees, met opregte bedoelings, dat ek glo dat hierdie pleidooi van my vanaand nie op dowe ore sal val nie. Ons het te doen met Swart mense wat &#x2019;n geweldige agterstand het. Dit is nou vir my ironies; die agb. lid vir Seepunt het vanaand oor dinge gepraat waaroor die Nasionale Party al jare praat. Hy het die lig gesien, want die Regering praat al jare oor die informele sektor van die ekonomie en nou het hy ewe skielik die lig gesien, en dit is wonderlik. Ek wens hom geluk.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek wil nou verwys na die owerheidsektor in sy geheel. Laat my toe om &#x2019;n paar dinge te noem. Ek is in my hart daarvan oortuig dat as ons nie indringend kyk na die Provinsiale Administrasies in Suid-Afrika en die werk wat hulle doen nie, dan is ons besig om &#x2019;n geweldige klomp man-nekrag in Suid-Afrika verkeerd te benut, en is ons besig om kapitaal verkeerd te benut. Laat my toe om &#x2019;n praktiese voorbeeld te noem. Hierdie sake het almal &#x2019;n geskiedenis, en daardie Opposisie was deel van daardie geskiedenis. Hulle kan nie weghardloop daarvan nie. Ons Provinsiale Administrasies bou paaie. Een van ons provinsies is waar skynlik die grootste aankoper van padboutoe-rusting in die hele w&#x00EA;reld. Ek wil die stelling maak dat die Provinsiale Administrasies onmoontlik nie op daardie terreine waarop hulle beweeg daardie werk goedkoper kan doen of meer effektief kan doen of mannekrag beter kan benut of toerusting beter kan benut as die privaatsektor nie. Daarom is dit &#x2019;n deel van my pleidooi dat Provinsiale Administrasies afstand sal doen van baie werk, maar dit sal onbillik wees om net te praat van die Provinsiale Administrasies. Die Sentrale Regering self doen op die oomblik baie dinge wat hy nie behoort te doen nie. Dit is nie net ek wat so s&#x00EA; nie. Vandag het die agb. Minister van Staatsadministrasie in die Ander Plek self ges&#x00EA; dat die Sentrale Regering op die ekonomiese terrein reeds etlike dinge laat vaar het wat hy voorheen gedoen het, soos byvoorbeeld die herstel van polisievoertuie. Hy het ook na ander projekte verwys wat voorheen deur die Sentrale Regering onderneem was. Ek glo dus dat ek in pas is met die gees van die Kabinet se standpunt as ek hierdie opmerkings maak. Daar is mense in ons Staatsmasjien wat s&#x00EA; dat die Regering &#x2019;n dam goedkoper kan bou as die privaatsektor. Dit is nie waar nie. Ek het by geleentheid met &#x2019;n top man in die Staatsmasjien gepraat en ons het &#x2019;n uur aan-mekaar oor die bou van &#x2019;n dam gedebatteer. Ek s&#x00EA; dit in &#x2019;n mooi gees. Sy standpunt was dat die Staat dit goedkoper kan bou. Kom ons s&#x00EA; dit reguit vir mekaar en vir die publiek daarbuite en ook vir die privaatsektor wat ons handlanger is, dat die Staat dit ni&#x00E9; goedkoper kan bou nie. Die man in die privaatsektor bou daardie dam vinniger as die Staat, want hy wil dit klaar bou om nog &#x2019;n dam te kan begin. Wat meer is, as hy baie geld gemaak het, betaal hy sy besigheid en al sy werknemers nog &#x2019;n groot klomp belasting ook. Die Staat bou ook geboue op &#x2019;n groot skaal.</p>

<p>Ek weet dat ek aan die wortel van ons owerheidmasjien se bestaan raak. Maar laat ons daarna kyk. Laat ek &#x2019;n voorbeeld noem. Die Nasionale Filmraad word afgeskaf en &#x2019;n klomp werk van die Nasionale Filmraad gaan na &#x2019;n ander Staatsinstelling wat presies dieselfde werk doen. Ek s&#x00EA; dit in alle eerlikheid. Dit is net eenvoudig nie in die gees van die privaatsektor nie. Neem nou maar die Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwee. Ons ken almal die argument van lonende en onlonende <span class="col_491-492" refersTo="page_0261"/>vrag en dienste. As daar goed is wat gesubsidieer moet word, en in Suid-Afrika sal daar altyd sulke goed wees, moet dit dan gesubsidieer word, maar ons moet daardie goed so min as moontlik hou. Ek kan my bv. nie indink dat die reisburo van die Suid-Afrikaanse Spoorwee &#x2019;n onderneming is wat by die Staatsektor hoort nie. So kan ons aangaan. Kom ons kyk na die administrasierade. Kom ons kyk na die drankwinkels wat di&#x00E9; rade het. Kom ons kyk na ons plaaslike besture.</p>

<p>Ek is absoluut oortuig dat as ons plaaslike besture in Suid-Afrika kyk na bankrot-skappe van plaaslike besture dwars oor die w&#x00EA;reld, hulle net eenvoudig sal moet insien dat een van die wesenlike probleme van plaaslike besture die feit is dat plaaslike besture al hoe meer goed en gepaardgaande personeel onder hulle vlerke neem en dat hulle as gevolg daarvan &#x2019;n geweldige klomp werk moet doen in die vorm van paaie wat gebou moet word en ander dienste wat gele-wer moet word wat hulle net eenvoudig nie so doeltreffend soos die privaatsektor kan lewer nie. Wat gebeur uiteindelik? In die totale owerheidsektor kry jy dan &#x2019;n massa mense, meer as 30&#x0025; van die totale werksmag. Op een of ander manier kom hierdie mense dan onder die owerheidsektor se vleuels wat behuising betref, hulle kom onder die owerheidsektor se vleuels wat die subsidi&#x00EB;ring van hulle pensioenvoordele betref, en uiteindelik kry jy die posisie dat waar jy probeer het om mense te help en hulle inderwaarheid nie gehelp is om hulle self te help nie. Daarom vra ek vir die agb. Minister dat hierdie Staande Advieskomitee teen Staatsinmenging tande moet kry en Staatsinmenging moet teenwerk. Laat ons revolusion&#x00EA;r dink in belang van ons land, want dit het niks met my te doen of met een enkele lid van hierdie Komitee nie, maar het te doen met die toekoms van ons kinders en ons land wat op &#x2019;n sterk, dinamiese ekonomie gebou moet word.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. H. SCHWARZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, by arrangement I have very little time and I want to use this time to talk about a particular subject. I must say that I would like to be involved in a debate with the hon. member for Innesdal on this very issue, because I actually agree with the hon. the Minister. This is a mixed economy and anyone who pretends that it is not a mixed economy is living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. I believe that it will continue to be a mixed economy. Whereas there are certain activities which quite clearly the State can disengage itself from and which perhaps should to a greater extent be let to the private sector, we are bluffing ourselves if we think that we can just leave everything to free enterprise, free market capitalism. These two terms seem to be interchangeable but they in fact mean different things. These two terms do not mean the same thing even though they are used interchangeably. I think we must accept the reality that this country will always remain a country with a mixed economy. The only way in which its problems can be solved is if those problems are dealt with on that basis. I welcome what the hon. the Minister has said tonight. I regard it as a breath of fresh air that people have been prepared to face reality and say that is what it is, instead of using this beautiful new catch term &#x201C;free enterprise&#x201D; and trying to solve all the problems by saying that everything should just be left to free enterprise. I can tell hon. members of as many bankrupt businesses as the bankrupt municipalities of which hon. members can tell me. Let us not pretend that everything in business turns out to be so marvellous. It does not.</p>

<p>I should like to return to a subject which I regard as fundamental to our future. I am referring to the revolutionary movements which exist in South Africa and Africa. They all have the same pattern whether they are called the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe or SWAPO or the ANC. The pattern is identical and the objective is also much the same. I want to use as an example relating to the economy the statement which Mr. Robert Mugabe made to the Zimbabwe Economic Society. He said that the revolutionary movement had four phases. Firstly, the reformist nationalism, which he called in his case the reformist nationalism of the &#x2019;fifties which was characterized by what he called predominantly non-violent situations. Secondly, the revolutionary nationalism which began in Zimbabwe in the 1960&#x2019;s and was characterized by what he called the arms struggle. The third phase was that of obtaining political power, to use his words, &#x201C;or the national democratic stage placing the physical instruments of power democratically in <span class="col_493-494" refersTo="page_0262"/>the hands of the people.&#x201D; That is the present stage in Zimbabwe, as he put it. Then he spoke of the fourth stage, perhaps in his eyes the most important stage, &#x201C;when the economic power should rest in the hands of the Zimbabwean people&#x201D;. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Government has already stated that its ideological direction as it set in motion its socio-economic processes of the current stage, is decidedly socialism.</block>

<p>That is what we really also have to face in regard to the endeavours of whether it be SWAPO in South West Africa or the ANC here. Those are the four phases at which they aim. The end result is not Russian imperialism, the end result is an economic system of which I think everybody in this House actually disapproves. That is the crucial point. How do we deal with it? The way to deal with it is by keeping it in the reform stage both politically and economically. That is the answer as I see it. You maintain your military strength, you maintain your power and while you do it you bring about the reform movement and only in that way can you actually stop the move towards arms struggle and towards the eventual communist type r&#x00E9;gime. I want to say to the hon. the Minister that if you use the ability to reform the economic system to deal with the aspirations of the deprived people while you have the military strength, then you can avoid the other four phases. If you do not do it while you have the military strength and the people&#x2019;s aspirations are not fulfilled and you are unable to do it within an economic system which will be acceptable to the whole country and, in particular, acceptable to those who are the productive element in the main today due to historical circumstances, you are actually jeopardizing the future of every White person in South Africa.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. D. CONRADIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Yeoville se betoog is na my oordeel hoogstens van akademiese belang en nie vir ons van aktuele belang nie. Ek is seker die parallel wat hy probeer trek, gaan eintlik nie op wat Suid-Afrika betref nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanaand graag &#x2019;n saak aanroer wat, alhoewel ek nie parogiaal wil voorkom nie, vir die gebied Port Elizabeth/Despatch/Uitenhage van besondere belang is, veral vanwe&#x00EB; die groot konsentrasie daar van buitelandsbeheerde maatskappye, en meer bepaald, Amerikaansbeheerde maatskappye. Ek verwys na die sogenaamde Sulfivan-kode of &#x201E;Sullivan Principles&#x201D;. Ek wil nie ingaan op die vraag of daardie kode vir ons omstrede is en in watter mate dit omstrede is nie. Dit word ook toegepas ten opsigte van baie ander fabrieke wat nie in buitelandse beheer is nie. Na die aanvaarding deur die Regering van die grootste gedeelte van die aanbevelings vervat in die Wiehahn-kommissieverslae, bly daar ook nie veel oor van daardie beginsels waaroor &#x2019;n mens jouself ongelukkig hoef te maak nie. Ek wil graag na twee van daardie beginsels verwys hoewel die tyd my nie sal toelaat om altwee in diepte te behandel nie. Die eerste beginsel waarna ek wil verwys, is &#x201E;non-segregation of all races in all eating, comfort and work facilities&#x201D;. Dit handel oor die kwessie van die deling van toilet-en eetge-riewe in fabrieke. Die tweede beginsel is &#x201E;improving the quality of employees&#x2019; fives outside of the work environment in such areas as housing, transportation, schooling, recreation and health facilities&#x201D;. In die tyd tot my beskikking, wil ek kortliks probeer handel met die tweede aspek wat ek genoem het. Dit is &#x2019;n saak wat in die afgelope tyd aansienlike aandag van die georganiseerde nywerheidswese in daardie nywerheidskom-pleks kry. Daar was ook indringende same-sprekings op ho&#x00EB; vlak met verteenwoordigers van die Volksraad en ook ander gemeenskapsleiers. Dit is vanselfsprekend &#x2019;n saak wat vir nywerhede en vir ons hele ekonomie van besondere belang kan wees. Dit gaan meer bepaald daaroor dat van die private sektor en meer spesifiek die nywer-aar verwag word dat hy sy deel moet bydra tot die huisvesting van sy eie werknemers. Ek wil graag by hierdie geleentheid by ons agb. Minister sekere maatre&#x00EB;ls bepleit wat dit vir nyweraars meer moontlik sal maak om hulle deel te doen wat hierdie saak betref. Wat die Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage-metropool betref, is daar tekens van bereidwilligheid aan die kant van nyweraars om hulle deel te doen in verband met die voorsiening van huisvesting vir hulle werknemers. Hulle is bereid om &#x2019;n bydrae daartoe te maak. Hulle voer egter aan&#x2014;en seker met &#x2019;n mate van reg&#x2014;dat daar nog <span class="col_495-496" refersTo="page_0263"/>sekere struikelblokke in hul pad is wat dit vir hulle moeilik maak om hulle deel ten volle by te dra. Daar is veral twee knelpunte wat genoem word. Die een knelpunt is dat daar onverbiddelik deur Staatsdepartemente aangedring word op &#x2019;n te ho&#x00EB; standaard van behuising en die tweede is dat volgens heersende beleid Staatsgeld nie beskikbaar gestel word vir die dienste vir &#x2019;n dorpsgebied waar die privaatsektor behuising vir werknemers wil oprig nie. Dit is werklik &#x2019;n aktuele probleem.</p>

<p>Die segsmanne van nywerheidswese in daardie omgewing is baie beslis daaromtrent dat hierdie twee knelpunte in die weg staan van die behoorlike ontplooiing van hul bydrae tot hierdie groot behoefte. Ek dink ons moet aanneem dat hulle standpunt eg is, want ons het geen rede om hulle <i>bona fides</i> wat hierdie saak betref, te betwyfel nie.</p>

<p>Dit tref so dat daar tans twee Regerings-kommissies is wat opdrag het om verskillende fasette van hierdie vraagstuk te ondersoek, naamlik die Viljoen-kommissie oor die privaatsektor se bydrae tot die behuisingsbe-hoeftes-ek verstaan die verslag is reeds in die hande van die Regering&#x2014;en, tweedens, die Louw-komitee met die opdrag om ondersoek in te stel na alternatiewe maniere vir die voorsiening van behuising vir die laeinkomstegroepe. In nywerheidskringe word daar in groot afwagting en met goeie verwagting uitgesien na die verslae van die komitee en kommissie in die vertroue dat dit aanleiding sal gee tot beleidsaanpassings wat hierdie twee knelpunte betref. Die belang-rikheid en dringendheid van hierdie aangeleentheid en van die beleidsaanpassings wat nodig geag word deur nywerheidswese word onderstreep deur beramings van reeds bestaande behuisingstekorte en behoeftes aan behuising vir die onmiddellike toekoms. Daar word beraam dat ons op die oomblik &#x2019;n tekort aan ongeveer &#x2019;n kwartmiljoen huise het waarvan nagenoeg 160 000 vir Swartes benodig word. Die jaarlikse totale vraag na behuising is nagenoeg 82 000. Op die oomblik finansier die Staat maar sowat 12 000 huise per jaar.</p>

<p>Gepaard daarmee is daar die ander groot vraagstuk waarna ook reeds in hierdie debat verwys is en wat eintlik &#x2019;n verwante probleem is, naamlik die skepping van genoeg werksgeleenthede vir die duisende mense wat jaarliks tot die arbeidsmark toetree. Uiteraard is dit ook &#x2019;n vraagstuk ten opsigte waarvan die nywerheidswese &#x2019;n sleutelrol moet en kan vervul. Inderdaad is hierdie vraagstuk nog meer aktueel as die vraagstuk van behuising. Volgens gesaghebbende beramings deur erkende deskundiges, hoof-saaklik gebaseer op geboortesyfers en ander onbetwisbare statistieke, was die getalle werksgeleenthede wat benodig was vir nuwe toetreders tot die arbeidsmark in 1980 nagenoeg 285 000, en sal dit in die jaar 2 000 nagenoeg 430 000 wees. Om in hierdie behoefte te voorsien, sal &#x2019;n groeikoers van ten minste van 5&#x0025; per jaar nodig wees. Ons kan aanneem dat die openbare sektor sy deel sal doen om in hierdie groot behoefte te help voorsien, maar dit is ook baie wenslik dat die privaatsektor sy deel sal doen. Ons sal veral na die nywerheidswese moet kyk vir &#x2019;n groot en belangrike bydrae ten opsigte van die skepping van werksgeleenthede en, gepaard daarmee, die voorsiening van behuising. Terwyl dit nou die geval is dat die nywerheidswese bereid is om sy deel by te dra wat betref die voorsiening van &#x2019;n gedeelte van die huisvesting vir hulle eie werknemers, is ons bly om te sien dat die agb. Adjunk-Minister van Gemeenskapsont-wikkeling &#x2019;n paar dae gelede voor VEESA die volgende verklaring gemaak het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die verhouding tussen die openbare en die privaatsektor op die behuisingsterrein moet as &#x2019;n vennootskap gesien word.</block>

<p>In die lig daarvan dat die privaatsektor bereid is om sy deel te doen, maar tog die aandag vestig op die knelpunte, is dit seker geregverdig om te verwag dat die nodige beleidsaanpassings ernstig deur die Regering oorweeg sal word. Volgens die agb. Adjunk-Minister is die Louw-komitee &#x201E;tans besig om as &#x2019;n saak van dringendheid die verskillende alternatiewe wat voorgestel word, soos selfbou en erf- en -diens, te ontleed en te ondersoek&#x201D;. &#x201E;Daarbenewens&#x201D;, aldus die agb. Adjunk-Minister, &#x201E;word op &#x2019;n deurlo-pende basis verdere insentiewe, waardeur die privaatsektor &#x2019;n groter bydrae kan lewer op die behuisingsterrein, ondersoek en voorstelle aan die tesourie gemaak&#x201D;. Hopelik sal daar langs hierdie weg die deur oopgemaak word vir wat die nywerheidswese noem die stelsel van gedifferensieerde huisvesting. Dit is wat hulle bepleit. Ek besef dat dit nie prim&#x00EA;r <span class="col_497-498" refersTo="page_0264"/>die verantwoordelikheid van ons agb. Minister is nie, maar nietemin weet ons dat hy tog invloed en inspraak het daar waar die besluite uiteindelik geneem sal word. Ons wil vertrou dat hy sy invloed ook sal gebruik om die nodige beleidsaanpassings te verseker. Die nywerheidswese wys op die talie voordele wat die aanvaarding van hierdie stelsel inhou. Daar word spesiaal op gewys dat selfbou nie sinoniem is met &#x2019;n gebrek aan of die afwesigheid van beheer nie. Daar is ook besliste voordele soos byvoorbeeld dat selfbou-behuising baie koste-effektief kan wees. Daar word ook daarop gewys dat die oprigting van huise en die voorsiening van dienste op &#x2019;n selfhelp-basis &#x2019;n vorm van kapitaalskepping is deurdat die inwoners se eie arbeid en ondememingsgees gekapitali-seer word. Daar word ook daarop gewys dat dit &#x2019;n vorm van besparing vir die inwoners is. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. RABIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek het die Swepe belowe dat ek baie kort sal praat en ek het dus nie die tyd om op vorige sprekers te reageer nie. Al wat ek wil s&#x00EA;, is dat party van hulle goed was terwyl ander minder goed was, veral die agb. lede wat hier regoor my sit.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil praat oor &#x2019;n baie vinnige ding&#x2014;dit is witblits. Ek verwys nie na mampoer wat gestook word van maroelas, turksvye of ander vrugte nie; ek praat van die ware Jakob. Dit is &#x2019;n produk wat gestook word van die wynstok. Dit is &#x2019;n edelproduk. Alles wat van die wynstok af kom, is edel, mits dit nie jou baas is nie.</p>

<p>Ons het vanjaar daar by Worcester &#x2019;n plaasmuseum geopen, of soos party mense dit noem, &#x2019;n opelug-museum. Dit verskil van ander museums deurdat dit lewe. Dit lewe en dit roer. Die normale take wat &#x2019;n mens op &#x2019;n plaaswerf te&#x00EB;kom, beoefen ons daar. Ou gewoontes wat al uitgesterf het, laat ons weer herleef. Ek verwys hier na ou gewoontes soos die bak van brood in &#x2019;n buite-bakoond en die maak van roosterkoek. Ek praat nie van soetkoek nie, maar van brood wat onder as gebak word. Ek verwys na ou gewoontes soos die maal van koring met &#x2019;n water-sowel as &#x2019;n perdemeul. Daar word ook gewys hoe koeie gemelk word, hoe botter gemaak word. Ag, agb. lede ken mos die ou takies, dit is te veel om op te noem. Voorts het ons 8 tipiese buitegeboue: &#x2019;n smidswinkel, &#x2019;n tuiekamer, &#x2019;n waenhuis, die 2 perdemeule, &#x2019;n tabakskuur en dan daar by ook &#x2019;n wynkelder. Terloops, hierdie wynkelder kom van die plaas van die oupa van die agb. lid vir Ceres. Sy oupa kon nog wyn maak, hy kan nie meer nie.</p>

<p>By hierdie opelug-museum word seisoens-gewys demonstrasies gegee van seep kook, rosyntjies maak en moskonfyt kook. Verder word daar tabak gekweek en daar word gewys hoe pruimtabak gedraai word, hoe skape geskeer word en, danksy &#x2019;n toegewing verlede jaar aan twee opelug-museums, word daar ook gestook. Ons stook nou die regte witblits daar. Die ander museum ten opsigte waarvan die toegewing gemaak is, is in Transvaal. Ek weet nie so mooi nie, maar ek dink dit is &#x2019;n mampoer-aff&#x00EA;re wat hulle daar in die Transvaal stook. Ek praat van die ware ding. Hierdie stokery vind plaas onder die strenge toesig van die Departement van Doeane en Aksyns. Dit word beheer. Ons betaal ook belasting op elke stooksel. So, hierdie goed val nie sommer uit die hemel uit nie. Ons ketel daar by Worcester hou 1 l&#x00EA;er. Vir diegene wat nie weet wat &#x2019;n l&#x00EA;er is nie, dit is so plus minus 570 liters. Ons kry gemiddeld so 50 liter per stooksel.</p>

<p>Tot dusver het die kelders in die distrik ingewillig om die mos te skenk. Normaalweg kos mos so R140 &#x2019;n l&#x00EA;er. Pietman, ek lieg mos nie nou nie, of hoe? [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is nou al meer met die verhoogde aksyns. Die aksynsbelasting wat ons op elke stooksel betaal, is gemiddeld R180 per stooksel. Met die verhoogde aksynsbelasting is dit nog meer. Hoe ho&#x00EB;r die alkoholge-halte, hoe meer is die aksyns. Hierdie stokery was vroe&#x00EB;r &#x2019;n belangrike faset van &#x2019;n plaas se bedrywighede. Vroe&#x00EB;r moes die mos gestook word, want daar was &#x2019;n groot probleem met die vervoer van die produkte na die mark. Daarom is daar vroe&#x00EB;r jare op groot skaal gestook. Daar was 3 of 4 ketels per plaas. Die boer en sy seun het self hierdie ketels beman, want nie enigeen kan by so &#x2019;n ketel sit nie. Die produk wat daaruit kom, is te lekker en te kwaai. Die blits is vroe&#x00EB;r eers in houtvate verouder en dan per wa in brandewynpype vervoer na die markte. So &#x2019;n reis op sy eie was al &#x2019;n groot &#x201E;job&#x201D;, want hierdie blits moes soos &#x2019;n kleinood bewaar word anders het dit gou voete gekry.</p>

<p>Vandag is daar nog die vaste geloof in die <span class="col_499-500" refersTo="page_0265"/>geneesende eienskappe van witblits. So byvoorbeeld word boegoe bygegooi vir nierkwale, koekemakranka vir &#x2019;n ombekrapte maag en die naloop van die blits word vandag nog aangesmeer vir rumatiek. Vir oumenskwale is witblits net die ding, maar dan moet jy hom drink en nie aansmeer nie. Dus, as enigiemand van hom in die hande kry en hom matig gebruik, is sy kop dwarsdeur.</p>

<p>Nou kom ek by die kruks van ons probleem. Tot dusver mag die museum die blits slegs op die perseel gebruik. Ons mag dit nie verkoop nie. Nou verkoop ons aan die mense &#x2019;n glasie vir &#x2019;n R1 en dan mag die besoeker van die voggies proe. Ons glo nie dit is onwettig nie, maar in elk geval, ons is nog nie gevang nie. Die behoefte is egter groot dat &#x2019;n lisensie toegestaan word vir die verkoop van die blits in byvoorbeeld hierdie 75 ml-botteltjies soos &#x2019;n mens op die vlieg-tuie kry, vir R2, of in die &#x201E;half-jackie&#x201D; wat ons altyd daar in Stellenbosch gekoop het, van 375 ml, vir R10. Dit is hier waar ons die agb. Minister se hulp baie nodig het. Ons het reeds by die Dranklisensieraad om so &#x2019;n lisensie aahsoek gedoen en ons wil die agb. Minister vra of hy ons nie in hierdie verband kan help nie. Omdat daar so &#x2019;n groot belangstelling in die stookproses is, word daar nou ten minste een keer per maand gestook en wat moet nou van di&#x00E9; produk word? Opproe kan ons dit Godsonmoontlik. Ons sal hom nooit opgeproe kry nie.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek het &#x2019;n bottel saamgebring dat agb. lede kan sien hoe hy lyk. Hy lyk soos water, hy is net ietwat sterker. Met die stook van hierdie blits het ons probeer om &#x2019;n stukkie kuituur te laat herleef. Saterdag was die Parlement se gholfspan op Worcester. Ons het die span na die museum geneem waar hulle kon sien en proe. Ek dink hulle sal beaam dat witblits jou gholf ook verbeter, want hulle was voor die tyd daar.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is bereid om hierdie bottel aan u of aan die agb. Minister te skenk as julle ons net sal help om die ding te verkoop. Dit is nie &#x2019;n omkoopgeskenk nie, dit is net &#x2019;n gebaar van welwillendheid teenoor u en die agb. Minister. Ek hoop dat ons ook welwillendheid van u kant sal kry.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not intend following the hon. member for Worcester. I acknowledge his greater knowledge of the subject. He is obviously an absolute expert on witblits and mampoer. I am very glad to hear that the Parliamentary golf-team use this as a putting mixture. I am a great believer in putting mixtures myself. I also think the hon. member actually was following along the lines of the hon. member for Sea Point, because what he is in fact pleading for is for the informal sector to be allowed to continue to grow.</p>

<p>I want to come to a couple of matters which I should like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The first one relates to a concession that was made last year with regard to export incentives by the hon. the Minister of Finance. He introduced two new categories of incentives for exports, categories A and B. One of the purposes of this was to allow exporters whose input prices had been raised because of tariff protection, a measure of relief so that they could export economically and compete in overseas markets. A very good idea and very worthwhile following. The protection given is often for strategic reasons. You protect a specific industry in South Africa even though it may not be economic, simply for strategic reasons. However, what about the local manufacturer who uses one of these protected articles in the manufacture of his own goods? He has to compete on the South African market with goods that are imported from overseas manufacturers. Those overseas manufacturers are able to buy the product which they use in the manufacturing of their own product at the normal international price which is considerably lower than the South African price.</p>

<p>This probleem is compounded by the fact that in some of the Far Eastern countries controls and regulations are of course far less stringent than they are in this country. One can find factories spilling out onto pavements and conditions in some of these areas would give a factory inspector in South Africa thrombosis on the spot. The products manufactured under these conditions flow into South Africa and the local manufacturer simply cannot compete pricewise.</p>

<p>I believe this situation needs attention. I believe these manufacturers need protection in terms of the fact that they have to pay <span class="col_501-502" refersTo="page_0266"/>dearly for a strategic protected product in this country.</p>

<p>The second subject I want to bring up, Mr. Chairman, is a subject I am sure that must be exercising the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s mind at the moment. He has had approaches in relation to the fact that credit cards are apparently no longer to be used for the selling of petrol, because the MIF have objected. I want to give the hon. the Minister some advice, if I may. I would suggest that he keeps out of this particular quarrel.</p>

<p>You have the wrong Minister; it has nothing to do with me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. N. MALCOMESS</person>:</from>

<p>I beg your pardon. I was under the impression that the Minister had been approached on the subject. If the hon. the Minister has nothing to do with it, I must leave that subject and get onto a subject which the hon. the Minister has already referred to this evening, and that is gearboxes and rear axles, and the protection given to local industry.</p>

<p>Last year the Minister awarded what was basically a monopoly to Gencor through its subsidiaries to manufacture gearboxes and axles for heavy vehicles. This suited some manufacturers of heavy vehicles but gave severe headaches to others. The hon. the Minister knows that this is the case. The monopoly was, we believe, highhandedly awarded, without reference to the trade; nor was it submitted to any sort of tender or contract. These gearboxes and axles have to be fitted by 1 January 1982. I see in the Press release that the hon. the Minister has been kind enough to give me, that it has been extended to the end of June 1982, in terms of rear axles. There is a penalty of 6&#x0025; excise on the whole vehicle, escalating by 3&#x0025; every six months to a maximum of 15&#x0025;. That, too, has been altered slightly by the Minister&#x2019;s latest announcement. I believe this creates a number of difficulties. Firstly, it is a monopoly, there can be no doubt about it; they are the only people who manufacture these gearboxes and rear axles in South Africa. They are protected from importation to quite a large degree. It favours certain types of trucks, notably Mercedes Benz and MAN trucks. It is expensive for almost all other makes and technology, and is not even suitable for some of these manufacturers whose prices will not only escalate, but the performance of their vehicles will suffer.</p>

<p>Lastly, we believe that Gencor&#x2019;s subsidiaries are unlikely to meet these deadlines. We know they have been extended. We hope the hon. the Minister will continue to extend the deadline for the protection fine for as long as the local manufacturers cannot meet the demand from the various local industries. We believe that this whole exercise is without doubt an interference in the normal market process. Perhaps the worst aspect of it is that waiting in the wings is another company which is ready to spend R24 million on a plant to manufacture gearboxes and axles. The Minister has confirmed this; I put a question to him earlier in the session. The decision has now been made that this new company will not be allowed to enter the South African market, and one must ask the hon. Minister, if they come in, how many jobs would this R24 million have created? I think the country should be told, what undertakings have been given to Gencor or its German associates? Why has he apparently created a monopoly? I believe that this type of situation should not be allowed to develop. I do not think any company should be given an undertaking that they can have a monopoly in the South African market. The hon. the Minister can say to them, by all means: We will provide you with tariff protection if you want to manufacture an article in South Africa, we will certainly give you protection against the imported article. It only makes sense. But to give them protection also against another manufacturer who wishes to set up an equivalent factory, admittedly to meet a slightly different need, because the technological needs of different manufacturers are obviously different, I believe is a step that should not be taken. It needs a tremendous lot of justification and I do not think it should be allowed to happen again. I am aware that the situation was created during the time of his predecessor, not his immediate predecessor but the one before that, Minister Heunis, who is now Minister of Internal Affairs. At the same time I think it is a lesson that this hon. Minister must learn&#x2014;that we should not under any circumstances create monopolies. Tariff protections yes, monopolies no.</p>

<p><span class="col_503-504" refersTo="page_0267"/>Now, Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to something the hon. the Minister said in his reply. He seemed to suggest that in my earlier speech I had said that we must totally free the private sector of interference and regulations. That is not the case. I believe, and I think the hon. the Minister agreed, that there are a large number of regulations that can be discontinued. I am not suggesting we take them all away. There are presently a number of different circumstances where the consumer has to be protected, where the South African economy has to be protected, but there are also many regulations where this is not necessary. The game is not worth the candle. The regulations that have to be looked at, controlled, regulated and policed, are certainly not worth the game and the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department must try to free the private sector of as many of these regulations as possible. The other questions that the hon. the Minister did not, in fact, reply to, are suburban shopping, the Indians and Asians having their shops taken away, central business districts and the fact that Blacks and Browns are not allowed to own businesses in CBDs.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid wat nou net gaan sit het, sal my verskoon as ek hom nie volg nie, want ons tyd is baie beperk. Ons het vandag gekom by &#x2019;n toestand wat baie goed is, naamlik dat Suid-Afrika besig is om te ontwikkel tot een van die grootste nywer-heidsreuse in die Suidelike Halfrond, indien nie een van die grootste in Afrika nie. Dit is verblydend dat ons op nywerheidsgebied sulke groot vooruitgang gehad het. Die belange van die klein sakeman is iets wat ons baie na aan die hart l&#x00EA;. Toe ek destyds, in 1979, my eerstelingtoespraak in die Raad gehou het, was dit &#x2019;n saak waarvoor ek baie gepleit het. Ek is baie dankbaar dat toe die Carltonberaad plaasgevind het, daar op die beraad baie ges&#x00EA; is waaraan uitvoering nou gegee word en wat van groot belang vir die klein sakeman sal wees. Die toegewings wat daar blyk te kom, is in belang van Suid-Afrika. Ons weet dat die Nywerheidsontwik-kelingskorporasie in die verlede geweldig baie gedoen het vir nywerhede, maar die NOK was miskien soms vir die klein sakeman te groot. Vandag het hy sy eie ontwik-kelingskorporasie, en omdat ons almal &#x2019;n besondere belangstelling in die klein sakeman het, glo ek dat hierdie korporasie aan alle verwagtings sal voldoen. Ons weet dat die groot sake-ondernemings, die groot indus-trie&#x00EB;, geweldig baie vir Suid-Afrika beteken het. Daar is sekere projekte wat te groot is vir &#x2019;n klein sakeman om aan te pak, maar daar is tog sekeres wat vir die groot sakeman te klein is om aan te pak. Daarom het die klein sakeman &#x2019;n baie deflnitiewe plek in Suid-Afrika. Sou dit byvoorbeeld gebeur dat &#x2019;n ramp &#x2019;n groot onderneming tref, kan dit die land baie nadelig raak. Maar sou dit byvoorbeeld die klein man tref, dan tref dit Suid-Afrika nie in so &#x2019;n groot mate nie. &#x2019;n Mens dink byvoorbeeld aan stakings wat soms by groot ondememings voorkom. Dit sou &#x2019;n uitsondering wees as dit by &#x2019;n klein onderneming plaasvind. Daarom is dit baie belangrik dat die klein sakeman sy regmatige plek kry.</p>

<p>Die klein sakeman se aansien in Suid-Afrika het ook in die afgelope paar jaar geweldig baie gestyg, en wel vanwe&#x00EB; die feit dat die Regering dit goed gedink het om die ontwikkelingskorporasie vir klein sake-ondernemings daar te stel. In sekere lande in Europa speel die klein sakeman &#x2019;n baie groot rol. As &#x2019;n mens so aan die toekoms dink, en jy sien wat gedoen word, dan het jy geen twyfel dat die klein sakeman se rol in Suid-Afrika al groter en groter sal word nie. In die groot ondememings is dit so dat &#x2019;n mens byvoorbeeld net &#x2019;n nommer is, terwyl in die klein sakeondememing hy &#x2019;n persoon is wat &#x2019;n lewende belang in daardie besigheid het. Die klein sake-ondememing is soos die huisgesin. Dit is ons s&#x2019;n. Ons Is die klein saak, ons werk vir daardie saak en daardie saak verdien vir ons geld. Die profyte wat ons maak, is ons s&#x2019;n. Ons sal nooit na die horlosie kyk nie, want dit is ons horlosie en ons weet ons moet hom ignoreer as ons in die klein sake-onderneming staan. Byvoorbeeld, ons sien dit raak as die krane drup, want dit is ons profyt wat daaruit drup. Ons sien dit byvoorbeeld raak as die elektrisiteit nie afgeskakel word wanneer die besigheid sluit nie, want dit is ons profyte wat daar verspil word. Daar is &#x2019;n lewendige belangstelling wanneer iemand &#x2019;n direkte belang by die saak het waarvoor hy werk.</p>

<p>Die klein sakeman is ook uit die aard van die saak baie minder geneig tot die sosia-lisme, en dit is baie belangrik vir &#x2019;n land soos <span class="col_505-506" refersTo="page_0268"/>Suid-Afrika. Dit was nie alleen die eerste vlak van regering wat hier &#x2019;n belangrike rol gespeel het nie, maar ook die tweede vlak, omdat die tweede vlak van regering sekere goedkeurings moet gee aan die derde vlak, wat die stadsrade is. Daarom kan die derde vlak van regering geweldig baie doen om die klein sakeman te help. Dit is gewoonlik die stadsrade wat die eerste weet van die spe-sifieke ondememings wat in hulle industri&#x00EB;le gebiede gestig staan te word. Dit is hulle wat gewoonlik weet in watter opsigte hulle kan help. Ek weet byvoorbeeld van &#x2019;n spesifieke stadsraad wat nie minder nie as 36 geboue opgerig het wat aan die behoeftes van klein sakeondernemings voldoen. Sodoende het hulle gehelp om 36 klein ondememings in die lewe te roep wat vandag as &#x2019;n monument daar staan; mense wat dit kwalik sou kon bekostig om &#x2019;n begin te maak, maar wat miskien eendag &#x2019;n baie groot onderneming gaan word. Wanneer daardie persele vir hulle te klein word, sal hulle na groter persele gaan en daar sal hulle die rol wat hulle in Suid-Afrika speel, beter kan speel as wat op die oomblik die geval is.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Klein ondernemer het moeilike probleme. Hy kan, byvoorbeeld, onder normale omstandighede nie so maklik na die aandele-beurs gaan as hy &#x2019;n behoefte aan geld het nie, want hy het nie altyd die stawende seku-riteit tot sy beskikking nie. Hy kan ook nie so maklik na die bank gaan en s&#x00EA;, kyk, ek wil &#x2019;n lening sluit nie. Ag, ek weet mos, baie keer moet &#x2019;n klein sakeman amper sy vrou en kinders verpand voor hy &#x2019;n lening kan kry om hom deur die drif te help. As hy &#x2019;n lening verkry, dan moet hy baie ho&#x00EB;r rente betaal omdat daar ho&#x00EB;r risiko aan verbonde is, as in die geval van &#x2019;n groot saak. Wanneer daar ho&#x00EB;r rente betaal moet word, spreek dit vanself dat hy nie in &#x2019;n posisie is om sy pryse so kompeterend te hou as wat normaalweg die geval is nie. Nog &#x2019;n nadeel vir die klein sakeman is dat wanneer hy masjinerie moet aankoop om sy werk vir hom te help doen, hy byvoorbeeld nie daardie masjiene ten volle kan benut nie, maar miskien net vyf tot tien persent. Dit is &#x2019;n groot kapitale belegging wat hy moet maak en dan net gedeeltelik kan gebruik.</p>

<p>Net so lief as wat &#x2019;n boer vir sy grond is, is &#x2019;n klein sakeman vir sy besigheid. Daar is plek in Suid-Afrika vir die klein sake-onderneming, want dit kan belangrike kommoditeite vervaardig en die groot onderneming daarvan voorsien, sodat ons nie van oorsee af hoef in te voer as dit nie absoluut noodsaaklik is nie. Die klein sake-onderneming, daardie familiebesigheid, wat &#x2019;n persoonlike trots opbou, is vandag ook die trots van Suid-Afrika. Mag die klein sakeondernemings groei van krag tot krag, saam met hierdie land wat, glo ek, ook groei van krag tot krag.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. BARTLETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am quite sure that the hon. member for Nigel already knows how my party and I feel about the small businessman. I just want to tell him that we agree entirely with what he said here this evening. I have already spoken about the small businessman and I have limited time at my disposal, so I want to go onto a subject which I want to bring to the attention not only of the Minister, but to the attention of the entire House.</p>

<p>The question I want to ask the hon. the Minister is: Does he believe that the Companies Act and the Stock Exchanges Control Act are providing adequate protection for investors today? Earlier on today, the hon. member for Yeoville spoke about the need for a Minister of Consumer Affairs and the hon. the Minister replied that we have all sorts of legislation on our law books which protect the consumer. But does the hon. the Minister believe that the Companies Act and the Stock Exchanges Control Act are protecting investors? I want to say to my colleagues in this House that we make laws, it is our business, to prevent crime, theft and fraud and to protect the public interest, and we take great pride in this. It is part of our great tradition and our history to ensure through parliamentary action that the public are protected. I am sure every hon. member will agree with me that this is one of the main functions of Parliament. But the question I want to ask is, are we effective enough? And if the laws are effective, then I want to ask whether the Ministers concerned, the Executive and the Administration are effective? Are they living up to the letter of the law and the spirit of the law? I ask these questions because of a very sad experience in the history of South Africa that has lasted over 11 years, where shareholders have fought to see justice done and, I believe, justice has not been done. I am referring <span class="col_507-508" refersTo="page_0269"/>to the National Fund Investments debacle, where an estimated 200 000 shareholders lost something like R20 million in what I believe, from the evidence at my disposal, was an out-and-out case of fraud. This is why I ask whether the laws we have passed in this House are effective.</p>

<p>I have been approached, over a long period of time, with the problems of these individuals who sought to obtain information so that they could proceed with a civil case in our courts of law. They were prevented from getting the necessary evidence. They wrote to the Department of Police and approached the commercial branch of the CID, and asked them to investigate. They were told that the matter had been passed on to the Attorney-General, to the Minister of Police, to the Minister of Justice, to the Minister of Economic Affairs&#x2014;for 11 years, and all along the way it appeared that their attempts to see justice done were frustrated.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I asked a whole series of questions in the House. I asked the Minister of Police whether any requests have been made since 1969 to investigate the affairs of the investment company whose name was mentioned in a judgement given in the Supreme Court on 11 February this year. The reply said: Yes, to the commercial branch of the South African Police on 12 occasions from 1973 to 1981, by shareholders. The reason was allegations of fraud and contraventions of the Companies Act. It said all these cases were investigated and submitted to the Attorney-General or to his Senior Public Prosecutor. To a question to the Minister of Justice, the reply was: Yes, Mr. Benson, one of the shareholders, over many years addressed letters and telegrams to officials and public office bearers. In this reply only the more formal letters addressed to the Minister of Justice that may have fallen within the ambit of the question, were dealt with. It started in 1976 and goes right through to 1981. If one studies the replies, one finds that this person was told on 22 September 1976 to recover any damages by way of civil action. Later on, in the reply to one of my inquiries, I was informed that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the Minister of Police. Mr. Benson wrote to the Minister of Police, also in 1979, requesting a <i>nolli prosequi</i> certificate. He was told to approach the Attorney-General. He then requested the re-arrest of the NFI managing director for contraventions of the Companies Act. He was told that the matter had to be dealt with by the South African Police. I could go on with this. The Minister&#x2019;s predecessors were approached. There were 41 requests over the period 1970 to 1981, not only from this one shareholder, Mr. Benson, but from many others, including the shareholders&#x2019; association that was formed to try to have this matter corrected.</p>

<p>It was only as a result of a civil case related in an indirect manner to this probleem, that the judge in the Supreme Court found that the prospectus of this company was misleading. It says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The prospectus was misleading in that to the knowledge of the board the proposed property mutual fund it holds out as a future project, had already been vetoed by the authorities.<br/>The assurances received by the JSE from NFI that &#x201C;where queries still exist from members of the public regarding their entitlement, these represent a minimal proportion of the whole&#x201D; were assurances that subsequent events proved NFI had not been entitled to have given.</block>

<p>As a result of the findings in this Supreme Court case, the matter is again before the Attorney-General. In reply to my question to the Police, I have been told that it is now before the Attorney-General. I want to know, how does an ordinary citizen, an ordinary shareholder, see justice done in this country. This particular person has spent tens of thousands of rands, his entire family&#x2019;s fortune, trying to sort this case out. In every instance he appears to be blocked. In order to get evidence to proceed with a civil case, he has asked for the verbatim court proceedings of the Supreme Court judgement of the Supreme Court case in February. He was told it was going to cost him R5 000 to get the verbatim proceedings. He instructed his attorneys to pay the R5 000. He has now received a request to pay an additional R2 500 for the proceedings.</p>

<p>The whole record. R5 000 and now an additional R2 500. I raise this because in the weekend paper, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, it states: &#x201C;The law must impose heavy penalties on unscrupulous company promoters&#x201D; and it quotes the Companies Act. Then it refers to section 166(1), saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is being widely ignored&#x2014;if the many cases of companies issuing shares without complying with the Act are anything to go on.</block>

<p>I refer this article to the hon. the Minister. It appears in the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the <i>Business Times</i>. It goes on to say that these unscrupulous people act despite the provisions of the Act. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They know that in the unlikely event of their being brought into a court of law, the fine will be a mere few hundred rands more than the fine attracted by a speeding offence.<br/>In effect, then, the worst that can befall the dishonest company promotor is that he refunds the subscription money to the wronged shareholder, pays interest thereon and coughs up a fine of a couple of thousand rands&#x2014;a sum which, thanks to inflation, is seldom burdensome to one of his financial status.<br/>Not much of a deterrent. It means that the unscrupulous promotor need offer little more than an apology, return the cheque, pay a relatively small fine and try again.</block>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that until this NFI matter is cleared up, until the shareholders who have asked for certain information have been given that information, so that they can proceed with a civil case, this will remain a slur and a blot on the name of the National Party and this Government.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is portuig dat die agb. Minister afdoende antwoorde sal gee op die probleme van die agb. lid vir Amanzimtoti. Ek het &#x2019;n ander probleem wat ek graag by hierdie geleentheid wil stel. Ek wil kortliks die eras van die problemsituasie in die inmaakbedryf hier skets. Aansluitend daarby wil ek aandui hoedat di&#x00E9; problemsituasie die stabiliteit van die landbou in die bre&#x00EB; in Wes-Kaapland kan ondermyn. &#x2019;n Nugter beskouing van die problemsituasie in die inmaakvrugtebedryf bring onmiddellik &#x2019;n oor-heersende indruk na vore, en dit is dat die tydige en doelgerigte optrede van die agb. Minister in medewerking met die agb. Minister van Landbou en die agb. Minister van Finansies &#x2019;n algehele chaos, ja selfs &#x2019;n ineenstorting van die bedryf, in die korttermyn afgeweer het. Hierdie doelgerigte optrede spreek duidelik uit die Persverklaring van 26 Augustus soos deur die dr&#x00ED;e agb. Ministers uitgereik. Dit lui soos volg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Na aanleiding van die ondersoek en aanbevelings van &#x2019;n interdepartementele komitee, het die Regering besluit om by-stand aan sagtevrugteboere wat vrugte vir inmaak lewer, te verleen. Die totale bedrag betrokke, wat hoofsaaklik die rasionalisasie van die bedryf ten doel het, beloop R9 miljoen.</block>

<p>Hierdie besliste optrede van die Regering verdien die hoogste dank en waardering van elke inmaakvrugteboer in ons land. As in-maakvrugteprodusent het ek ho&#x00EB; waardering vir die agb. Minister se begrip en aanvoeling vir die erns van hierdie saak. Waar die Regering se finansi&#x00EB;le bystandsplan die rasionalisasie van die bedryf ten doel het, ontstaan die vraag: Hoe gaan hierdie rasionalisasie-proses die inmaakvrugteboer raak tydens die komende vrugteseisoen? Volgens &#x2019;n in-ligtingstuk van die Raad vir Inmaakvrugte kom die kembelangrike aanpassings vir die inmaakvrugtebedryf tydens die komende vrugteseisoen van 1981-&#x2019;82 op die volgende neer: Die eerste aanpassing is die ingrypende bepaling dat die inname van inmaakvrugte beperk word tot tonnemate wat die mark hopelik in die komende jaar kan absorbeer. Die uiters neerdrukkende bemarkingstoestande het hierdie ingrypende maatre&#x00EB;l gebiedend noodsaaklik gemaak in die korttermyn. Die Raad vir Inmaakvrugte het dus met die goedkeuring van die Regering besluit om die inname van appelkose, taaipitperskes en pere te beperk tot die potensieel-bemarkbare hoeveelhede. Die bemarkbare tonnemaat is deur die Raad vir Inmaakvrugte vasgestel op 85 000 ton inmaakgraad-taaipitperskes, <span class="col_511-512" refersTo="page_0271"/>30 000 ton in-maakgraad-pere en 20 000 ton inmaakgraad-appelkose. Die produsent se permittoekenning vir die 1981-&#x2019;82-seisoen is bereken op die hoogste lewering van inmaakgraad-vmgte gedurende die 1979-&#x2019;81-seisoen of die 1980-&#x2019;81-seisoen. Volgens hierdie basis sal die inmaakvrugte-produsente, volgens voorlopige beramings, die volgende persentasies van hulle inmaakvrugte se produksie gedurende die 1981-&#x2019;82-seisoen kan lewer (hierdie persentasies is bereken op hulle hoogste lewerings gedurende 1979-&#x2019;80 of 1980-&#x2019;81)&#x2014;</p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p>Appelkose</p></td>

<td><p>&#x2014; 82&#x0025;</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Taaipitperskes</p></td>

<td><p>&#x2014; 64&#x0025;</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Pere</p></td>

<td><p>&#x2014; 57&#x0025;</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>Dit spreek dus vanself dat die produsent &#x2019;n ander afsetkanaal vir sy surplusvrugte moet vind. Die tweede belangrike aanpassing is dat die Staat en die Raad vir Inmaakvrugte die minimum prys van hierdie voorgeskrewe tonnemaat met 50&#x0025; sal subsidieer tot &#x2019;n maksimum van R50 per ton vir taaipitperskes, R42 per ton vir appelkose, en R40 per ton vir pere. Die Raad vir Inmaakvrugte stel dit egter baie duidelik dat di&#x00E9; Staatshulp onder geen omstandighede beskou moet word as sou dit vir meer as een jaar beskikbaar wees nie, aangesien die doel daarmee is om die produsent in staat te stel om volgens eie oordeel sy boerderystruktuur by veranderde omstandighede aan te pas.</p>

<p>Die derde aanpassing stel die boer in staat om sy boerderystruktuur by veranderde omstandighede aan te pas deur deel te neem aan &#x2019;n permanente boomontrekkingskema. Volgens hierdie skema word die in-maakvrugteprodusent in staat gestel om hom permanent van die produksie van inmaakvrugte te onttrek ná die betaling van &#x2019;n gegewe bedrag per hektaar, wat bereken word volgens produksieprestasie op &#x2019;n gegewe oppervlakte. Hierdie ingrypende maatre&#x00EB;ls dui onweerlegbaar daarop dat die inmaakbedryf in die korttermyn moet worstel om te oorleef, iets wat gevolge kan h&#x00EA; wat wyer kan uitkring en die stabiliteit van die landbou in Wes-Kaapland uiters nadelig kan be&#x00EF;nvloed. Daar bestaan &#x2019;n uiters noue verwantskap tussen die inmaakvrugtebedryf en ander landbousektore in die Wes-Kaap, bv. die wynbedryf, die sagtevrugtebedryf en die dro&#x00EB;vrugtebedryf. So kan die inmaakvrugteprodusent wat wynproduksie-kwotas besit na wynproduksie oorskakel, ter-wyl die wynbedryf met toenemende surplus-voorrade van brandewyn en wyn worstel. Die inmaakvrugteprodusent kan dus ook sy surplusproduksie na die sagtevrugtemark oorskakel, terwyl die sagtevrugtebedryf reeds bemarkings probleme ondervind. Die inmaakvrugteprodusent kan ook natuurlik sy surplusproduksie oorskakel na die dro&#x00EB;vrugtemark. Die dro&#x00EB;vrugtebedryf het tot op hede &#x2019;n gesonde en ordelike bemarkingspa-troon kon handhaaf, so &#x2019;n skielike omskake-ling kan bemarkings probleme vir die dro&#x00EB;vrugtebedryf tot gevolg h&#x00EA;. Hierdie moontlikhede kan die ordelike bemarkings-patroon en die gesonde balans tussen hierdie landbousektore in Wes-Kaapland heelte-mal versteur, en die versteuring kan op sy beurt langtermynbeplanning in hierdie vier landbousektore in die war stuur. Dit kan slegs tot gevolg h&#x00EA; dat die stabiliteit van die landbou in Wes-Kaapland nadelig be&#x00EF;nvloed word.</p>

<p>Dit is &#x2019;n bron van diepe kommer en onsekerheid, veral as ons die langtermyn-en kapitaalintensiewe aard van hierdie vier landbousektore in gedagte hou. Dit is van basiese belang, want daar word algemeen aanvaar dat die ekonomiese groei en stabiliteit van Wes-Kaapland hoofsaaklik bepaal word deur die groeipotensiaal en stabiliteit van sy landbousektor. Teen hierdie agtergrond is ek verheug oor, en dankbaar vir die agb. Minister en sy kollegas, die agb. Minister van Landbou en die agb. Minister van Finansies, se beslissing om die hele aange-leentheid na die Jacobs-komitee vir verdere ondersoek te verwys. Ek wil die agb. Minister egter vriendelik versoek om sy invloed te gebruik om hierdie ondersoek te bespoedig sodat daar meer helderheid oor die ontwikkelingspad van die landbou in Wes-Kaapland verkry kan word.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit met twee verdere versoeke aan die agb. Minister. Die vier landbousektore wat ek genoem het, is in &#x2019;n groot mate aangewys op die buitelandse markte vir die bemarking van hul produkte, maar hulle ondervind toenemend probleme op sommige buitelandse markte omdat daar steeds ho&#x00EB;r tariefmure teen hulle opgebou word en omdat daar Staatshulp aan hul mededingers verleen word. Ek wil derhalwe &#x2019;n dringende versoek aan die agb. Minister rig om ons uitvoerbevorderingskema <span class="col_513-514" refersTo="page_0272"/>s&#x00F3; aan te pas dat ko&#x00F6;peratiewe ondernemings wat uitvoer ook ten volle kan deel in die uitvoerderstoelae.</p>

<p>Die laaste versoek het te doen met &#x2019;n saak wat groot frustrasie onder produsente veroorsaak. Ek vprwys na die geweldige skerp styging in die koste van verpakkingsmateriaal wat &#x2019;n uiters druipende invloed op die vier landbousektore uitoefen. Dit is vir die boer &#x2019;n bron van frustrasie as die waarde van sy produk &#x2019;n al hoe kleiner wordende deel uitmaak van die waarde van die klaarverpakte produk. Dit is ook vir die boer &#x2019;n bron van frustrasie as sy winsgrens steeds moet daal. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek reageer graag op wat die agb. lid vir Ceres te s&#x00EA; gehad het. Alhoewel ek ook verstaan hoe om gedroogte of ingelegte vrugte te geniet, moet ek egter bieg dat my kennis nie sodanig is dat ek die agb. lid in hierdie opsig van veel hulp sal kan wees nie.</p>

<p>Jy het darem biltong daar.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#weeber">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. WEEBER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, oor biltong kan ek praat. Ek wil &#x2019;n paar gedagtes uitspreek oor die kleinsake-ondememing, maar ek wil net graag in die verbygaan meld dat ek dankbaar is dat wat die agb. lid vir Yeoville hier ges&#x00EA; het, nie die beleid van die Nasionale Regering is nie. Hy het ges&#x00EA; die ontwikkeling moet op die bestaande metropolitaanse gebiede toegespits word omdat dit goedkoper sou wees om daar te ontwikkel. Hy het ook &#x2019;n paar ander voordele genoem. Dit sal egter &#x2019;n kwade dag wees as ons in hierdie land nie ook gebalanseerde ontwikkeling op geografiese gebied sou h&#x00EA; nie.</p>

<p>Die belangrikheid van &#x2019;n ewewigtige en sterk ekonomiese lewe van &#x2019;n land kan seker nie oorbeklemtoon word nie. Dit kan bestempel word as die ruggraat van &#x2019;n moderne Staat met &#x2019;n vryemarkstelsel. As nuweling wil ek graag daarvan getuig dat ek met waardering kennis geneem het van besliste stappe deur die Regering ter bevordering van die kleinsakeman in Suid-Afrika sedert die agb. Eerste Minister se Carlton-beraad, en ek s&#x00EA; dit in weerwil van wat agb. lede vanmiddag hier ges&#x00EA; het toe hulle beweer het dat daar nog niks gebeur het nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook aansluit by wat die agb. lid vir Nigel ges&#x00EA; het oor die kleinsakeman. Ek is daarvan oortuig dat die suksesvolle deurvoering van die aangekondigde stappe in die toekoms na waarde geskat sal word en aanvaar sal word as een van die betekenisvolste deurbrake op ekonomiese gebied in de-kades.</p>

<p>Die definisie van &#x2019;n kleinsake-onder-neming kan ek ongelukkig weens &#x2019;n gebrek aan tyd nie hier meer breedvoerig bespreek nie, maar ek dink dit is heeltemal prakties om &#x2019;n kleinsake-ondememing op nywerheidsgebied te beskou as een met 100 of minder werkers, en op handelsgebied as &#x2019;n onderneming met &#x2019;n maksimum omset van R1 miljoen per jaar. Ek weet nie of dit uiteindelik die agb. Minister se norm sal wees nie, maar dit is &#x2019;n norm wat soms gebruik word. Daar is ook nie genoeg tyd om die betekenis van die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie en die aanstelling van die Programadviesraad, soos deur die agb. Minister aangekondig, te bespreek nie. Ek wil net kortliks verwys na die Programadviesraad, want om verskeie redes glo ek dat hierdie raad &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol sal speel. Een van die redes waarom dit goeie resultate sal lewer, is die feit dat &#x2019;n kundige Vrystater ook betrek is by die bedrywighede van hierdie instansie. Kortliks kom dit daarop neer dat hierdie Programadviesraad probleemareas sal identifiseer wat bevordering belemmer en omvattende beleid ter aanmoediging van klein-sake-ondernemings sal ondersoek, asook die toedeling van fondse aan verskeie instansies wat gemoeid is met die lewering van dienste soos advies, voor-ligting en navorsing, koordinering van alle aksies van die instellings wat die saak bevorder en dan ook enige ander sake wat met sodanige bevordering te doen het. Ek dink die agb. Minister het in sy verklaring dit meer volledig gestel, maar ek raak net aan daardie punte.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander baie belangrike faktor is die kwessie van die rasionalisasie van die verskeie ontwikkelingskorporasies. Ek dink daar is ongeveer vyf. Ek dink dit is ook &#x2019;n baie positiewe stap. Daar is dan ook, soos reeds gemeld is, die instelling van &#x2019;n ontwikkelingsbank vir Suider-Afrika. Dit is ook bepaald &#x2019;n baie belangrike stap. Die nugtere wyse waarop die Staat die kleinsake-ondememing gaan bevorder, skep &#x2019;n besondere geleentheid <span class="col_515-516" refersTo="page_0273"/>vir samewerking tussen die Staat en die privaatsektor, maar ook tussen die State van Suider-Afrika, en dit kan natuurlik die konstellasiebegrip bevorder. Indien hierdie omvattende program doelgerig uitgevoer word, kan dit tot gevolg h&#x00EA; dat die welvaart van die land beter versprei word, dat daar meer werkgeleenthede geskep word, dat daar groter samewerking tussen geografiese en staatkundige gebiede bewerkstellig word en dat daar beter dienslewering in die plattelandse gebiede sal ontstaan. Ek hoop dat die agb. Minister met hierdie aksie, wat ons almal met belangstelling volg, &#x2019;n groot mate van welslae sal behaal.</p>

<p>Hoewel die agb. Minister nie alleen hierby betrokke is nie, dink ek dat hy, in oorleg met sy agb. kollegas, tog baie kan doen vir die saak wat ek nou gaan opper. Ek wil graag &#x2019;n pleidooi lewer. Indien die agb. Minister hierdie saak met sukses kan opvolg, sal dit tot gevolg h&#x00EA; dat kleinsake-ondernemings ook baie beter gevestig word. Ek wil die agb. Minister vra om hom daarvoor te beywer dat nuwe kleinsakeonder-nemings ten minste vir drie tot vyf jaar lank nie inkomstebelasting hoef te betaal nie. Ek wil vra dat hulle vrygestel word van die betaling van inkomstebelasting, want dit sal hierdie instansies &#x2019;n geleentheid bied om gevestig te raak. Die oorgrote meerderheid van klein ondernemings sit met die probleem van &#x2019;n tekort aan kapitaal, en deesdae is kapitaalvorming &#x2019;n lang proses&#x2014;veral in die geval van maatskappye waar &#x2019;n groot deel van die winste in die slag bly. As die ondernemer dus die eerste paar jaar daarin kan slaag om kapitaal te vorm, d.w.s. as hy sy winste ook vir sy onderneming kan gebruik, kan dit hom in staat stel om behoorlik gevestig te raak. Ek dink nie ons hoef in daardie verband baie bekommerd te wees oor die posisie van die Staatskas nie, want indien die betrokke sake-onderneming na di&#x00E9; tydperk goed gevestig is en &#x2019;n goeie wins maak, is dit des te meer &#x2019;n bate vir die Staatskas. Ek glo werklik dat dit vir die kleinondernemer van groot waarde sal wees indien hy gedurende daardie beginjare, terwyl hy worstel met &#x2019;n tekort aan kapitaal, in staat gestel kan word om &#x2019;n bietjie meer werkkapitaal bymekaar te maak. Ek hoop werklik dat ons ook in belang van die kleinsake-onderneming iets sal kan doen.</p>

<p>Ek wil net ten slotte weer eens aansluit by wat die agb. lid vir Nigel ges&#x00EA; het. Ons is dankbaar vir die baie groot ondernemings in die land wat skeppers van werkgeleenthede is, maar dit is veral in ons plattelandse gebiede&#x2014;hoewel dit ook in stedelike komplekse geld&#x2014;dat die kleinsakeman in die land &#x2019;n baie groot rol in ons ekonomie kan speel. Ek hoop dat die agb. Minister in daardie opsig ons ekonomiese lewe sal bevorder deur ook die belange van die kleinsake-onderneming aan te moedig. Ek glo dat ons van die reeds aangekondigde stappe die afleiding kan maak dat die Regering wel ems het met hierdie saak. Daarvoor het ons besondere waardering.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Welkom had a very interesting line of thought there, although I can foresee some major practical problems in trying to identify just when a small business is still in its initial years of growth. The principle, however, is an interesting one.</p>

<p>I should like to touch on another matter, namely that of the development of the Western Cape. Since the hon. the Minister, for about a year now, has been a wandering candidate through these parts, he will have found out that the Western Cape has, relatively speaking, been going backwards in recent years, in fact in recent decades. The Western Cape&#x2019;s share of the gross national product has slipped back, in the 15 year period 1960 to 1975, from 13,8&#x0025; to 12,8&#x0025;. Going back even further, we see that the position the Western Cape held initially was that of the only metropolitan complex of the nation. It held the number one spot until the mines were discovered, at which time it was relegated to number two spot. Since the early &#x2019;sixties it has been relegated to number three spot, having had to concede second place to Durban. It is often said on that side of the House that the reason for this is that we do not have any mines and are short of natural mineral resources and primary industry. I want to put it to that side of the House very clearly, however, that I do not in any way accept the argument that because there are no mines in the Western Cape the area is doomed to go backwards. There are many cities throughout the world that have no mines and yet do progress. Hong Kong is an example, Japan as a country, is an example, and Durban itself is an example. Durban <span class="col_517-518" refersTo="page_0274"/>has become the number two industrial complex of South Africa, and yet it has no mines. We therefore have to look for other reasons. I should like to suggest that in the Western Cape one of the primary causes of our &#x201C;agteruitgang&#x201D; is Government policy. [Interjections.] In Government policy lies the key to the probleem, and Government policy, if correctly applied, could supply the key to growth in this area. [Interjections.] Would hon. members please be so good as to give me a hearing? On matters such as this we should ignore party-political divisions and realize that we have a common interest in the welfare of this region. [Interjections.] I have ten points I should like to put to the hon. the Minister tonight.</p>

<p>Hulley&#x2019;s ten-point plan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Constantia&#x2019;s ten-point plan. The first point goes right to the heart of Government policy. I am not going to expand on it, because I have already had a chance to discuss it, but the Coloured labour preference policy is one of the things that is throttling this region. Economists tell us the same thing, as do various experts. What I am telling hon. members on that side of the House is that one needs people, at all levels, for an area to grow, and this policy is holding us back. We could talk about this all night, but let me rather leave it at that.</p>

<p>The second major point, which I could perhaps expand on a bit more, is that we must encourage and stimulate the development of base metal beneficiation in this region. We have ores in the northern part of the Cape Province which are exported out of this part of the Cape Province, and we must beneficiate them and thereby create the jobs that such beneficiation would provide. We have two export harbours and we have steel ore, copper, manganese, lead and zinc, all leaving the country from these parts. We must therefore do something with them right here. The steel semis plant in the West-coast region is a long-overdue development. The Government may argue that it is not the Government&#x2019;s role to subsidize the development of that industry. That may well be so, but the Government could certainly take steps to encourage its creation.</p>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>One of the things that could be done is to guarantee private sector loans to bring this about. It is not merely a question of steel semis, because the other base metals would come into this as well.</p>

<p>The third aspect, one of the major keys to the development of this region, is tourism, but the probleem holding us back in the field of tourism in these parts is again Government policy. Unless we have an open international zone, without the restrictions of apartheid policy, discrimination and all the silly things that go with it, we are not going to be able to attract our fair share of the world tourist market. Tourism is an ideal development industry for these parts. It is clean, it helps local infrastructure to develop and it also generates foreign exchange. We cannot get international tourism off the ground, however, until we get rid of the apartheid policy. Why is it that we do not have Hilton Hotels, Club Mediterranee or many other of the international hotels or hotel chains located here? Why is it that we do not have the international conferences that other major cities of the world do have? It is obvious that we do not because major conferences and the leading hotel chains permit all races to make use of their services. It is impossible for a major conference to take place in Cape Town if one of the delegates to that professional conference, in travelling into the Boland and stopping at a garage, is turned away when he wants to use the toilet. [Interjections.] The hon. the Minister and the NP as a whole need to look at this matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>If it is nonsense, the hon. the Minister must explain to us why the Hilton Hotel chain has built a hotel in Maseru and not in Cape Town. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The fourth point is that Cape Town must have an expanded port of entry with equal status to that of Johannesburg. This is one of <span class="col_519-520" refersTo="page_0275"/>the key elements in getting tourism off the ground in this part of the world. To my mind there is no justification for the particular surcharge we have for international flights leaving Cape Town as opposed to Johannesburg. We should have more flights, and international carriers should also be allowed to land here in greater numbers. It is an unnecessarily retrogressive penalty on Cape Town that this is not allowed. Other countries have more than one port of entry, and this is an obvious step which would benefit this region.</p>

<p>My fifth point is that we should allow for the development of an international casino complex right here in the Western Cape, something like that at Sun City. [Interjections.] In my opinion a good site would be Robben Island, but there are also other sites. [Interjections.] This type of development has good economic foundations and has proved to be very important to the economic well-being of other parts of Southern Africa, the Black territories in particular. If it is good for those people, why can it not be good for us? If Government ideology can find a way to justify Sun City, with all its unrestricted possibilities, right in the middle of the Western Transvaal bush, the Government can surely find a justification for us to have one right here in the Western Cape. To combine a Sun City-type complex with our magnificent Western Cape scenic beauty would make for an irresistible tourist attraction.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>The sixth point involves the restructuring of transport, energy and water tariffs to improve the competitiveness of Western Cape industries. Because that is an extensive subject in its own right, I shall not be expanding on it further at this stage.</p>

<p>My seventh point involves the removing of all restrictions on the business freedom of other races in order to unleash their full entrepreneurial potential, and in this part of the world there is a tremendous amount of potential lying outside the White group, but it is not being tapped properly because it is restricted by Government laws. The hon. member for Bryanston developed that point.</p>

<p>The eighth point is that we must do more to encourage export-orientated activities or value-added activities in this part of the world. That is also an entire subject in its own right, and I therefore cannot expand further on it now.</p>

<p>The ninth point is that we should develop the necessary infra-structure now, one example being an Atlantis West Coast rail fink.</p>

<p>Finally I want to mention the encouragement of the informal economic sector, a theme which the hon. member for Sea Point developed very well. Hong Kong is only one example of how the informal sector can create a powerhouse base for a metropolitan area.</p>

<p>Those are the ten points I have singled out, but there are many other points that could be added. They are the ones, however, that seemed to me to be the most important at this stage. Not one of these points calls for a Government subsidy. Some of them call for Government action, but most of them call for Government withdrawal, for a getting off the backs of the businessmen in this area and for an ending of its ideological tinkering, particularly with regard to the restrictive race policies that are applied. If the Government would get off the private sector&#x2019;s back in the Western Cape and get rid of the race laws that are holding us back, a business environment would be created that would enable the private sector to lead this area into a real boom phase.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. KLEYNHANS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek weet nie of daar nog iets is waarvoor die NP blameer kan word nie. Die agb. lid vir Constantia is egter nie konse-kwent nie. In die een asem s&#x00EA; hy vir ons Durban is besig om &#x2019;n nywerheidsreus te word, maar Kaapstad is besig om dood te gaan. Ek wil die agb. lid graag inlig. Dieselfde NP-beleid wat in Durban geld, geld ook hier in Kaapstad. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hy s&#x00EA; dit is as gevolg van NP-beleid dat Kaapstad geen toeriste kry nie. Durban kry egter toeriste. Daar moet regtig waar nie verwag word dat die Regering Kaapstad as toeriste-aantreklikheid moet bevorder nie. Vra maar vir die Toeristeburo om hande uit die mou te steek en toeriste hierheen te bring, want toerisme is een van ons belangrikste bedrywe. Ek dink dat alles in die guns van Wes-Kaap tel. Ons moet maar net die toeriste hierheen bring. Na my mening kan &#x2019;n mens egter &#x2019;n <span class="col_521-522" refersTo="page_0276"/>begin hier in Kaapstad self maak, by die Toeristeburo.</p>

<p>Voordat ek &#x2019;n spesifieke saak, wat ek op die hart het, in hierdie debat uitlig, wil ek eers graag verwys na die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal. Soos agb. lede weet, kom ons van dieselfde stad af. Ek het geen fout te vind met die feit dat die agb. lid vir daardie streek van ons vanaand hier &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer het nie. Ek wil die agb. lid egter daarop wys dat daar nie nou eers begin is om pleidooie vir daardie streek te lewer nie. Pleidooie word al lank oor daardie streek aan die hoogste vlak gerig. As gevolg van daardie pleidooie het daar reeds al baie mooi dinge in Port Elizabeth plaasgevind. Daarvoor is ons die Regering baie dankbaar. Ongelukkig is daardie streek egter arm aan grondstowwe en is ons ver verwyder van die groot markte. Die grondstowwe moet van ver vervoer word en die finale produkte moet dan ook weer oor &#x2019;n lang afstand vervoer word. Met ander woorde, die potensiaal vir die daarstelling van nuwe nywerhede is nie so goed soos wat dit aan die Witwatersrand is nie.</p>

<p>Daarom moet ons nou na &#x2019;n ander aspek kyk. Ons moet probeer om ons bestaande nywerhede te help om in die eerste plek daar te bly en om in die tweede plek uit te brei. Ek dink die agb. lid is bewus van die feit dat daar oor hierdie aspek die wydste verto&#x00EB; aan die Regering gerig is wat nog ooit uit Oos-Kaapland aan die Regering gerig is. Elke belanghebbende liggaam, georganiseerde handel en nywerheid, plaaslike besture&#x2014;om die waarheid te s&#x00EA;, almal&#x2014;het die geleent-heid gekry om verto&#x00EB; te rig. Daar is &#x2019;n dokument van ten minste 100 bladsye wat op die oomblik op die hoogste vlak aandag geniet. Ek wil die agb. lid vra om saam met my vertroue te h&#x00EA; in daardie streek, want ek glo dat daardie streek, met &#x2019;n bietjie hulp van die Regering, nog daarin sal slaag om vir al sy mense, afgesien van ras of kleur, werkgeleenthede in die toekoms te bied. Dit is so &#x2019;n mooi streek en daar is soveel potensiaal wat net ontgin moet word.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag baie kortliks &#x2019;n sakie aanroer wat ressorteer onder die Departement van Nywerheidswese, Handel en Toerisme, maar wat na my mening meer spesiflek hanteer word deur die Suid-Afrikaanse Buro vir Standaarde. Ek verwys na die gepubliseerde nasionale konsepbouregulasies. Dit is die onderwerp wat tans wye bespreking uitlok en wat warm debatte oplewer, veral op die vlak van plaaslike bestuur. Uit die aard van die saak is die nasionale bouregulasies baie tegnies van aard. Ek sal dus nie waag om op die tegniese detail van hierdie bouregulasies in te gaan nie. Ek sal probeer om te bly by die bre&#x00EB; beginsels van die begrip van nasionale bouregulasies.</p>

<p>Ek glo dat eenvormige nasionale bouregulasies allerwe&#x00EB; aanvaar sal word, want eenvormigheid in die boubedryf kan lei tot eenvoudiger ontwerp, eenvoudiger konstruksie en ook minder onnodige inspeksies. Wat is die posisie op die oomblik? Daar is meer as 500 munisipaliteite in Suid-Afrika en elkeen van hierdie munisipaliteite stel maar hulle vereistes. Sommige munisipaliteite, en ek s&#x00EA; dit met alle respek teenoor hulle, stel ter wille van &#x2019;n bietjie prestige, onnodige streng vereistes met betrekking tot geboue. Dit gebeur in so &#x2019;n mate dat &#x2019;n mens op &#x2019;n sekere plek vind dat &#x2019;n gebou &#x2019;n sekere bedrag kos, maar dat in die buurdorp &#x2019;n soortgelyke gebou tot 25&#x0025; meer kos. Na aanleiding hiervan wil ek die Departement gelukwens met die inisiatiewe wat geneem is om die grondslag vir Nasionale Bouregulasies te l&#x00EA; sodat ons eenvormige bouregulasies dwarsoor die land sal h&#x00EA;. Hierdie Republiek van ons is egter &#x2019;n groot land met klimaatsomstandig-hede wat wissel van streek tot streek, in so &#x2019;n mate dat ons in sommige streke al die sei-soene op een dag kan kry. Ek dink dus dat dit noodsaaklik is dat ons hierdie streekver-skille in aanmerking sal neem by die opstel van sulke nasionale bouregulasies.</p>

<p>Ek moet die Departement krediet gee, want hy het heel aan die begin hierdie aspek met die opstel van die bouregulasies besef. Streekkomitees is saamgestel wat kommen-taar kon lewer op die konsepregulasies. As &#x2019;n mens die konsepregulasies van nader beskou, kan &#x2019;n mens sien dat as gevolg van al die getuienis wat ingedien is en die besprek-ings wat plaasgevind het, die basiese beginsels wat streekverskille betref, ongelukkig in die proses verlore geraak het. Volgens die kommentaar deur plaaslike bestuursliggame kry &#x2019;n mens die indruk dat sekere van hulle aanbevelings nie oorweeg is nie. Verder kry &#x2019;n mens die indruk dat daar aspekte by die nuwe regulasies ingebring is wat tog inflasie in die hand sal werk. Ek wil net &#x2019;n paar eenvoudige voorbedde opnoem. Ingevolge die <span class="col_523-524" refersTo="page_0277"/>nuwe konsepregulasies moet daar by betonmengsels nou ook kalk gevoeg word. In sommige streke is kalk geslagte lank nooit gebruik nie. Die beskikbaarheid van hierdie materiaal is twyfelagtig, en as dit beskikbaar is en dit moet oor lang afstande vervoer word, kan dit tot ho&#x00EB; boukoste aanleiding gee.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Saak wat my bekommer, is die verbod wat op die gebruik van aluminium en glas-versterkte plastiek geplaas word. Ons kuseiendomsontwikkelaars en grondeienaars het oor die afgelope aantal jaar al hoe meer van aluminium en glasversterkte plastiek gebruik gemaak om roes te voorkom. As hierdie materiaal nou verbied word en ons moet terugkeer na die gebruik van staal, wil ek s&#x00EA; dat roes vir ons in Suid-Afrika baie geld gaan kos.</p>

<p>Verder word daar ook beswaar gemaak teen die dikte van mure in streke waar rukwinde voorkom. Ek dink nou aan ons Ooskus, en die Bloemfontein-Upington-Beaufort-Wes-driehoek. Plaaslike besture is van mening dat die aanbevole dikte van mure onvoldoende is, veral as hierdie rukwinde met re&#x00EB;n gepaard gaan. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek volg die agb. lid vir Algoa baie graag. Ek dink hy het vanaand nie net sy eie kiesafde-ling nie, maar ook die kiesafdeling Umfolozi waar ek vandaan kom, &#x2019;n groot guns bewys. Hy het onder meer die gebruik van aluminium in die boubedryf bepleit. Ek kom van Richardsbaai af, waar daar &#x2019;n aluminiumsmelter opgerig is wat in die totale behoeftes van hierdie land voorsien. In die onlangse verlede het hierdie maatskappy &#x2019;n kontrak gesluit&#x2014;hulle is tans besig met die uitvoering daarvan&#x2014;om &#x2019;n aluminiumsmelter in Japan af te breek. Dit is aangekoop teen &#x2019;n koste van R200 miljoen en word na Suid-Afrika vervoer om hier opgerig te word. Hierdie maatskappy sal sodoende in staat gestel word om sy produksie te verdubbel. Ek dink dus dat dit uiters belangrik is dat ons die gebruik van hierdie metaal sal bevorder.</p>

<p>Dit was vir my vanaand baie interessant om na hierdie debat te luister. Ek was nie van plan om deel te neem nie en bedank dus die Sweep vir hierdie geleentheid. Ek wil vanaand &#x2019;n paar agb. lede bykom.</p>

<p>Die agb. lede vir onderskeidelik Bryan-ston en Seepunt het vanaand hier gepraat oor die kwessie dat daar met apartheid weg-gedoen moet word, en in hierdie verband het hulle in die besonder na groepsgebiede en skole verwys. Ek dink dit is my plig om dit onder agb. lede se aandag te bring dat dit my voorreg was om in die tussenverkiesing by Simonstad vir &#x2019;n week lank daar behulp-saam te wees. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston was voorsitter en die agb. lid vir Seepunt was die gasspreker by &#x2019;n vergadering wat daar in die burgersentrum van Vishoek gehou was. Ek het die vergadering bygewoon en nie &#x2019;n woord van een van daardie agb. lede gehoor oor die Swart mense wie se belange hulle so in hierdie Raad bepleit nie. Nie dat ons die Swart mense in hierdie land afskeep nie, want ons is di&#x00E9; land in die w&#x00EA;reld wat die buitew&#x00EA;reld met trots in die o&#x00EB; kan kyk vir wat ons doen vir die opheffing van ons Swart mense in hierdie land. Hierdie agb. lede kies egter hulle geleenthede. Die gehoor daardie oggend om 11-uur het bestaan uit pensioen-trekkers en afgetrede ou mense. Wat gebeur toe? Daar is ges&#x00EA; dat die ou mense deur die Regering afgeskeep word. Daar word te min vir hulle gedoen met betrekking tot behuising en pensioene.</p>

<p>Toe ek tydens vrae-tyd aan hulle vra wat hulle beleid t.o.v. groepsgebiede is, is daar nie aan my die geleentheid gebied om my vraag te voltooi nie omdat ek dan &#x2019;n buitestaander sou wees. Hulle wil nie te midde van daardie ou mense wat daarteen gekant is om hulle gebied vir alle rasse oop te gooi, hulle standpunt stel nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Yeoville het vanaand gewaarsku teen die gevaar van monopolis-tiese toestande. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;The Government is destroying the small business man&#x201D;. Daar is &#x2019;n sekere organisasie in hierdie land wat bekend staan as Anglo American. Ons weet almal watter lojaliteit Anglo American het en wat sy politieke gesindheid is. As &#x2019;n mens aan daardie kant van die Raad sit, moet &#x2019;n mens kennis neem van wat in daardie geledere aangaan. [Tussenwerpsels.] Wie is besig om die <span class="col_525-526" refersTo="page_0278"/>&#x201E;small business men&#x201D; te vernietig? Is dit die Regering of is dit Anglo American?</p>

<p>Wat gaan aan? As &#x2019;n mens sekere feite wil konstateer, moet jy eers voor jou eie deur vee. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston moet hiervan kennis neem. In my omgewing is daar &#x2019;n onrusbarende ding aan die gang. Ek praat nou van die Umfolozivlakte, waar ons &#x2019;n suikerko&#x00F6;perasie het. Anglo American wil daardie suikermeul bekom. Aanvanklik het hulle &#x2019;n frontorganisasie gebruik, maar hulle kon nie daarin slaag nie. Hulle het toe begin om die klein boere in die omgewing uit te koop. Die markwaarde van suikerplase is op die oomblik tussen R45 en R55 per ton, maar daardie maatskappy het daar tot R130 per ton betaal, en hulle het ook geweet by wie om die proses te begin. Hulle het die klein suiker-boere daar uitgekoop omdat hulle die suikermonopolie in daardie omgewing wou bekom. Hulle wou nie net daardie sekere meul inpalm nie, maar wou beheer oor die ganse suikerbedryf verkry. Agb. lede aan die oorkant is die laaste mense wat hierdie Regering daarvan kan beskuldig dat hy die klein sakeman wil vernietig, of monopolie&#x00EB; wil skep. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek &#x2019;n paar opmerkings maak oor die groeipunt Richardsbaai. Dit is belangrik dat die agb. Minister sy invloed in die Kabinet gebruik om hierdie gebied se belange te bevorder. Hierdie groeipunt is in nasionale belang. Dit is belangrik dat hierdie groeipunt sal uitbrei en van krag tot krag sal gaan omdat baie werkgeleenthede daar ook aan die Zoeloevolk verskaf kan word. Wat die Staat betref, is dit in hierdie stadium nog net die Spoorwee wat in werklikheid sy kant gebring het deur middel van die bou van die hawe en die geriewe wat daarmee gepaard gaan. Die ander Staatsdepartemente moet ook nou hulle kant bring sodat die gebied kan ontwikkel. Dit is nie goed genoeg dat ons net konsessies aan nyweraars gee om hulle daarheen te lok en ons oor gebrekkige geriewe beskik wat al die ander Staatsdepartemente betref nie. Die poskantoor is in &#x2019;n voorafvervaardigde geboutjie gesetel en net so ook die polisiestasie. Die Departement van Gesondheid se kantoor is ook in &#x2019;n tydelike gebou. Hierdie is belangrike aspekte om die ekonomie te stimuleer. Ek wil vra dat die agb. Minister sy invloed gebruik sodat hierdie dienste ook behoorlik daar beskikbaar gestel word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Umbilo is nou ongelukkig nie hier nie, maar wat die Provinsiale Raad van Natal betref, wil ek s&#x00EA; dat hulle ook nou moet begin vinger trek om die nodige geriewe en dienste te skep. Op die oomblik het ons twee addisionele prim&#x00EA;re skole dringend nodig anders sal kinders daar onder &#x2019;n boom moet skoolgaan.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER VAN NYWERHEIDSWESE, HANDEL EN TOERISME</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ons het vandag heel-wat positiewe toesprake van hierdie kant van die Raad gehoor en daar is &#x2019;n paar waarop ek beslis sal reageer. Ek is egter van mening dat die amptelike Opposisie in &#x2019;n politieke en ekonomiese dilemma verkeer. Hierdie dilemma het vandag duidelik geblyk uit sekere toesprake wat deur agb. lede aan Opposisiekant gelewer is. Ek wil graag na twee van hierdie toesprake verwys.</p>

<p>Die eerste toespraak waarna ek wil verwys, is die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Bryanston. Sommer met die wegspring, het die agb. lid vir Bryanston so verstrengel geraak in sy party se rassistiese politieke ideologie&#x00EB; &#x2026; [Tussenwerpsels.] Agb. lede moet nou luister, want ek het nie een van hulle gepla toe hulle gepraat het nie. Hy het so in hierdie ideologie&#x00EB; verstrengel geraak dat hy in hierdie dualistiese ekonomie van Suid-Afrika nie die werklike probleme kon identifiseer nie. Omdat hy nie in staat is om die werklike probleme te identifiseer nie, het die probleme wat daar werklik bestaan, so enorm vir hom geword in sy politieke kon-sep dat hy kapituleer en vir ons geen oplos-sings kan bied nie. Dit geld ook die agb. lid vir Constantia.</p>

<p>Laat ons egter vir &#x2019;n oomblik na die teenbeeld van hulle dilemma kyk, naamlik die agb. lid vir Yeoville. Dit spyt my dat die agb. lid vir Yeoville nie nou hier is nie. Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad het geen fout te vind met die ontleding wat die agb. lid vir Yeoville gemaak het nie. Hy beskik oor die vermo&#x00EB; om ekonomiese probleme in die regte perspektief te stel en rasioneel te analiseer. Hy dra hulle dan ook aan ons op &#x2019;n baie rasionele manier voor. Hy is egter gekniehalter, <span class="col_527-528" refersTo="page_0279"/>en wel deur die rassistiesingeklede politieke ideologie&#x00EB; van sy partygenote. Hy besef dat hy binne die politieke ideologie&#x00EB; van sy party nie &#x2019;n oplossing kan vind vir die probleme wat hy aan ons uitgewys het nie. Wat het hy dus gedoen? Hy het &#x2019;n beroep op die agb. Minister gedoen om daardie probleme op te los. Dit is probleme wat hierdie kant van die Raad, die agb. Minister en die Departement al jare gelede ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer het. Die agb. lid vir Yeoville vra egter dat hierdie Regering en hierdie Minister die oplossings vir die probleme moet vind.</p>

<p>Dit is die dilemma waarin die Opposisie verkeer. Die een agb. lid kan nie die probleme identifiseer nie omdat hy te verstrengel is in sy party se ideologie&#x00EB;, terwyl die ander agb. lid die vermo&#x00EB; het om die probleme op &#x2019;n rasionele wyse in perspektief te stel binne die dualistiese ekonomiese stelsel, maar hy word gekniehalter deur die politieke ideologie&#x00EB; van sy party. Ek sien die agb. lid vir Yeoville is nou weer hier en ek wil net herhaal wat ek ges&#x00EA; het. Die agb. lid het &#x2019;n beroep op die agb. Minister gedoen om die probleme wat die agb. lid baie goed ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer het, op te los. Ek laat agb. lede aan die oorkant daar.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou graag reageer op wat die agb. lid vir Innesdal ges&#x00EA; het. Hy het verwys na die probleme waarmee plaaslike owerhede te make het. Hy het eintlik verwys na die ondersoek wat tans deur die Croeser-groep gedoen word oor die Browne-komitee se ondersoek. Onder die begrotingspos Finansies het ek die saak breedvoerig behandel, maar ek dink die agb. lid vir Innesdal het vanaand iets aangesny waaroor daar duidelikheid verkry moet word. Hy het veral verwys na die funksionele verdeling tussen die private sektor en plaaslike owerhede of Staatsowerhede. In hierdie verband wil ek die agb. lid gerusstel. Ek dink die punt wat hy gestel het, is &#x2019;n baie belangrike punt en een wat ons ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer het. Agb. lede sal onthou dat die Browne-komitee geen aandag aan daardie funksionele verdelingsaspek gegee het nie. Nadat die Browne-komitee se ondersoek egter voltooi was, is daar sekere opdragte aan die Croeser-groep gegee. Een van die opdragte aan hulle was dat daar ook in die lig van die Browne-komitee se ondersoek, pertinent gekyk moet word na die funksionele verdeling van take tussen die verskillende staatsorganisasies, byvoorbeeld die sentrale owerheid self, die provinsies en plaaslike owerhede, asook die funksionele verdeling tussen plaaslike owerhede en die privaatsektor om te kan bepaal hoe daardie besondere take op die mees ekonomiese en doeltreffendste manier uitgevoer kan word. Ek wil die agb. lid vir Innesdal dus bedank vir sy toespraak, want dit is juis deel van die opdrag van die Croeser-werkgroep om in die lig van die agb. Eerste Minister se beleid van rasionalisering te kyk na die funksionele verdeling van take tussen die privaatsektor, plaaslike owerhede en die provinsies. Dit is my reaksie op die agb. lid vir Innesdal se pleidooi dat daar na hierdie funksionele verdeling gekyk moet word.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou by die agb. lid vir Algoa kom. Soos in vorige debatte waar dit oor plaaslike bestuursaangeleenthede gegaan het, het die agb. lid vir Algoa weer eens vanaand &#x2019;n baie belangrike aangeleentheid aangeroer, te wete die bouregulasies. Ek wil graag &#x2019;n paar opmerkings oor bouregulasies maak. Agb. lede sal onthou dat die Wet op Nasionale Bouregulasies en Boustandaarde in 1977 goedgekeur is. Hierdie Wet maak daarvoor voorsiening dat die agb. Minister deur middel van die SABS, soos die agb. lid tereg daarop gewys het, nou nasionale bouregulasies kan opstel en dat hierdie nasionale bouregulasies dan uiteindelik aan die hand van hierdie Wet gewettig sal word en in werking sal tree. Op die oomblik heers daar &#x2019;n geweldige emosionele polemiek oor besware teen die nasionale bouregulasies. Gelukkig vind hierdie polemiek nog nie in die Pers plaas nie. Ek ontvang egter stapels briewe van verskillende plaaslike besture oor hierdie bouregulasies. Die konsepbouregulasies is in Februarie vanjaar in die <i>Staatskoerant</i> gepubliseer en ek meen die termyn vir kommentaar op hierdie bouregulasies is tot 16 Oktober verleng. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat ons hierdie aspek &#x2019;n bietjie in perspektief moet stel. Ek wil graag vanaand sekere riglyne neerl&#x00EA; wat na my mening belangrik is wanneer ons hierdie bouregulasies evalueer. Hierdie riglyne wil ek as bre&#x00EB; riglyne stel en hulle kom baie ooreen met die probleme wat die agb. lid vir Algoa ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer het.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag die volgende beginsels neerl&#x00EA;. Eerstens, wanneer hierdie bouregulasies gefinaliseer is, moet hulle buigsaam wees. Tesame met hierdie buigsaamheid, <span class="col_529-530" refersTo="page_0280"/>moet daar egter &#x2019;n mate van uniformiteit wees. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat die bouregulasies sekere eenvormige en standaardrig-lyne sal neerl&#x00EA; waarbinne die buigsaamheid toegepas kan word. Tweedens, is daar tog bepaalde aspekte in die plaaslike bestuursre-gulasies wat vir alle gebiede eenvormig moet wees. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat die boure-gulasies daardie faktore wat eenvormig moet wees, sal identifiseer en dit in sy finale vorm sal identifiseer. Dit is baie belangrik dat hierdie eenvormige riglyne wat deur die bouregulasies neergel&#x00EA; sal word, voorsiening moet maak vir streeksverskeidenheid. Dit is ook die punt wat die agb. lid vir Algoa gestel het. Daarby moet dit ook daarvoor voorsiening maak dat &#x2019;n verskeidenheid boutegnieke ook met betrekking tot hierdie bouregulasies moontlik is. Daar moenie &#x2019;n vaste boutegniekstelsel by hierdie regulasies ingebou wees nie.</p>

<p>Derdens, moet die bouregulasies ook voorsiening maak vir die gebruik van &#x2019;n groot verskeidenheid boumateriaal. Daarmee bedoel ek nie dat enige materiaal gebruik sal kan word nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek bedank die agb. Sweep van harte vir die vergunning.</p>

<p>Die derde punt wat ek wil stel, is dus dat daar vir &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van boumateriaal voorsiening gemaak moet word. Hierdie verskeidenheid van boumateriaal moet egter nie ongekontroleerd gebruik word nie. &#x2019;n Beheerstelsel moet bestaan om te verseker dat goedgekeurde boumateriaal gebruik sal word.</p>

<p>Die vierde punt wat ek wil stel, is dat hierdie bouregulasies nie tegniese regulasies moet wees nie. Ons moet daarvan probeer wegbly. Ons moet eerder kyk of dit nie moontlik is om met hierdie eenvormige riglyne oor bouregulasies die vermo&#x00EB; te skep dat die deskundiges, die kundige mense in die boubedryf, soos siviele ingenieurs, elektrotegniese ingenieurs, meganiese ingenieurs, bourekenaars en argitekte, sal bepaal wat die tegniese aspekte sal wees.</p>

<p>Die laaste punt wat ek wil stel en wat vir my baie belangrik is, is dat ons op die oom-blik die probleem ondervind dat boukoste besig is om geweldig te eskaleer. Ek dink die bouregulasies moet so buigsaam wees ten opsigte van al die aspekte wat ek gemeld het, dat dit nie &#x2019;n nog groter bydrae lewer met betrekking tot boukoste nie. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat daar ook gelet word op die finansi&#x00EB;le implikasies van die nasionale bouregulasies. Die agb. lid vir Algoa het ook na hierdie aspek verwys.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur net te s&#x00EA; dat wanneer ons by 16 Oktober kom, ons al die kommen-taar oor hierdie nasionale bouregulasies sal evalueer. Ek wil vanaand die versekering gee dat die evaluering van hierdie kommen-taar met die grootste mate van omsigtigheid gedoen sal word. Ons sal die evaluering in samewerking met deskundiges op die verskillende terreine met die grootste mate van omsigtigheid doen. As al die kommentaar in samewerking met die deskundiges en belang-hebbendes verwerk is, sal ons waarskynlik die bouregulasies vir verdere kommentaar beskikbaar stel voordat dit in werking tree om seker te maak dat hulle nie net op papier staan nie, maar dat hulle implementeerbaar, prakties en finansieel uitvoerbaar is.</p>

<p>In die paar minute tot my beskikking wat oorbly, wil ek &#x2019;n aangeleentheid aanroer waaroor ons in die afgelope tyd verto&#x00EB; ontvang het, naamlik die kwessie van weema-vorsingsprojekte. Daar is &#x2019;n verskeidenheid weemavorsingsprojekte, en veral die een by Nelspruit ondervind groot finansi&#x00EB;le probleme as gevolg van tegniese oorwegings. Die Regering is gevra om hierdie projek oor te neem en te finansier. As gevolg van hierdie verto&#x00EB; het ek ondersoek laat instel en na aanleiding van die ondersoek is gevind dat navorsing oor weermodifikasie in Suid-Afrika van kardinale belang is. Hierdie ondersoek het egter ook die volgende feite na vore gebring en ek wil vlugtig na hulle verwys.</p>

<p>Daar is op die oomblik drie weernavorsingsprojekte in Suid-Afrika. Die een is by Bethlehem en ek wil net vlugtig die in-stansies opnoem wat betrokke is by die weemavorsingsprojek daar. Die agb. lid vir Ladybrand, in wie se kiesafdeling hierdie projek plaasvind, hou gewoonlik elke jaar &#x2019;n baie interessante toespraak oor die resultate van hierdie projek. Die instansies wat hierby <span class="col_531-532" refersTo="page_0281"/>betrokke is, is die Weerburo, die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring, die Departement van Vervoer, die Watemavorsingskommissie en twee afdelings van die WNNR.</p>

<p>Die WNNR onderneem ook &#x2019;n ander projek oor weemavorsing, haelbestryding en stormontwikkeling. Die derde projek is die een by Nelspruit wat op die oomblik finansi&#x00EB;le en tegniese probleme ondervind. By laasgenoemde is die Laeveldse Ko&#x00F6;perasie, die Cansas International Corporation, die Watemavorsingskommissie, &#x2019;n groep wetenskaplikes van Virginia wat huileself die Simpson Weather Associates noem, betrokke.</p>

<p>Die ondersoek het aan die lig gebring dat daar op die oomblik &#x2019;n wesenlike gebrek aan kommunikasie bestaan en die aangeleentheid is met die Eerste Minister se Afdeling: Wetenskaplike Beplanning uitgeklaar. Omdat addisionele geld van die Staat gevra word vir weemavorsingsprojekte, sal die hele aangeleentheid van weemavorsing na die Wetenskaplike Beplanningsafdeling van die Eerste Minister se Kantoor verwys word, wat die koordinering met betrekking tot die hele projek sal doen. Hulle sal dan aanbeve-lings aan my Departement doen.</p>

<p>Ek wil die Komitee bedank vir die geleentheid om hier te kon praat en ek hoop dat ek m&#x00F4;re die geleentheid sal kry om volledig te antwoord op die agb. lid vir Constantia se opmerkings oor toerisme in Wes-Kaapland.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Seepunt het aangedui dat hy ook nog aan die debat in die Raad moet gaan deelneem en daarom wil ek eerstens graag kortliks antwoord op enkele van die vrae wat daardie agb. lid gestel het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het my gevra om te antwoord op verskillende aspekte rakende die NP se beleid byvoorbeeld die verwydering van diskriminasie, groepsgebiede ens. Ek kan verstaan dat daardie agb. lid, as lid van die PFP en ook voormalige leier van daardie party seker gewoond geraak het daaraan om die kommer in sy hart te dra oor waar lede van sy party spesifiek sou staan. Ek kan hom egter die versekering gee dat lede van die NP nie hierdie probleem het nie omdat lede van die NP by die beleid van hul party staan. Daardie agb. lid en die agb. lid vir Bryanston koester verniet die vermoede dat ek in Piketberg besig is om heimlik &#x2019;n ander beleid as die beleid van die NP te verkondig.</p>

<p>Die NP is &#x2019;n party met &#x2019;n besondere dinamiese groeikrag en lewenskrag. Dit is ook &#x2019;n party met realisme en soveel lewenskrag en energie dat agb. lede aan daardie kant van die Raad dit ons heel dikwels beny. Hulle maak egter ongelukkig die fout&#x2014;en dit moet ek dadelik byvoeg&#x2014;dat hulle die bruisende energie en die vonkeling van lewe in hierdie party raaksien as die eerste tekens van skeuring en versplintering. Nee, hierdie party is kernge-sond en dit is bereid om op realistiese en verantwoordelike wyse na die probleme van Suid-Afrika te kyk. Die vonkeling van hoop wat hulle dikwels verkeerdelik raaksien as die lig in hul donker politieke tonnel is eint-lik, vir hulle inligting, die aankomende trein.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Seepunt het, na aanleiding van die feit dat ons &#x2019;n Eerste en Derde W&#x00EA;reld ineen is en dat ons &#x2019;n dualistiese ekonomiese stelsel het, &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer vir die informele sektor wat algemeen bekend staan as die terrein waarop ekonomiese aktiwiteite plaasvind sonder indiensneming van verdere produksiefaktore. Hy het hoof-saaklik &#x2019;n saak probeer uitmaak dat vanwe&#x00EB; die teenwoordigheid van &#x2019;n Derde W&#x00EA;reld in <span class="col_533-534" refersTo="page_0282"/>ons Eerste W&#x00EA;reld-gemeenskap normale en standaarde sodanig aangepas behoort te word dat dit ruimte moet skep vir die Derde w&#x00EA;reld in ons midde. Nadat ek gisteraand na die agb. lid geluister het toe hy van die Eerste en Derde w&#x00E9;reld praat, het ek lus gevoel om &#x201E;Eureka, hy het ontdek dat ons in werklikheid nie net &#x2019;n eenvormige gemeenskap is nie, maar dat ons tegelyk &#x2019;n Derde en &#x2019;n Eerste W&#x00EA;reld in een is!&#x201D; Ons is &#x2019;n hoogs ontwikkelde en moderne gemeenskap en daar is aspekte soos veiligheid, gesondheid, besoedeling, omgewingsbewaring, geraas, rommel en ander onooglikhede wat &#x2019;n mens nie net sonder meer kan toelaat en die ekonomie sy eie loop laat neem nie.</p>

<p>Ek handel nou met die agb. lid vir Seepunt. Ek sal by die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal kom. Ek is dit 100&#x0025; met die agb. lid eens dat ons ons standaarde nie so hoog moet stel dat dit onmoontlik word vir ekonomiese bedrywig-hede ook in die minder ontwikkelde gedeeltes van ons gemeenskap nie. Daar is egter sekere standaarde en norme wat redelik is vir &#x2019;n ontwikkelde gemeenskap en &#x2019;n ontwikkelde ekonomie en ons kan nie twee stelle waardes en twee stelle reels in Suid-Afrika handhaaf nie. Die feit van die saak is egter dat die NP se beleid juis voorsiening maak vir die bestaan van &#x2019;n Derde en &#x2019;n Eerste W&#x00EA;reld en vir die gemeenskappe wat tot beide hierdie w&#x00EA;relde behoort. Juis deur voorsiening vir hierdie verskeidenheid te maak in Suid-Afrika skep ons ook die ruimte waarin &#x2019;n meer informele ekonomie in hierdie gemeenskappe geakkommodeer kan word. Ongelukkig wil dit egter voorkom asof die agb. lid vir Seepunt nog nie dieselfde sienswyse wat hy ten opsigte van die ekonomiese werklikhede huldig, op die politieke werklikhede van toepassing maak nie. Ter-wyl hy pleit vir die verskille van &#x2019;n Eerste en Derde W&#x00EA;reld op ekonomiese gebied, verontagsaam hy dit wanneer hy by die politieke aspekte kom.</p>

Polities eis hy &#x2019;n starre eenvormigheid terwyl hy op ekonomiese gebied die veelsydigheid van Suid-Afrika erken en graag wil sien dat erkenning daaraan verleen word.</p>

<p>Die laaste vraag wat die agb. lid gestel het waarna ek net kortliks wil verwys, hou verband met sentrale besigheidsdistrikte. Ek wil net die agb. lid se geheue weer verfris deur te s&#x00EA; dat die Regering, na aanleiding van die Riekert-kommissie se verslag, die beginsel aanvaar het dat sentrale besigheidsdistrikte op handelsgebied tot stand kan kom&#x2014;trouens artikel 19(1) van die Groepsgebiede-wet maak daarvoor voorsiening&#x2014;en die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling waaronder die toepassing van die Groepsgebiedewet ressorteer, skenk op die oomblik verdere aandag aan hierdie aangeleentheid.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag verwys na &#x2019;n saak wat deur verskeie sprekers aange-roer is, te wete, die ontwikkeling van klein sake in Suid-Afrika. &#x2019;n Mens waardeer dit besonder dat soveel aandag vandag aan die klein sakeman gegee word en dat na sy belange omgesien word. Die feit dat soveel sprekers in hierdie debat na hierdie onderwerp verwys het en aspekte van die probleme wat die klein sakeman ondervind, aan die orde gestel het, getuig van &#x2019;n nuwe gees en benadering ten opsigte van die klein sakeman wat net goed voorspel vir ekonomiese aktiwiteit op daardie gebied. Ons moet in gedagte hou dat die industri&#x00EB;le-en han-delsreuse van vandag almal as kleinsake-ondernemings begin het. Die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie se totstandkoming is daarom ook die resultaat van &#x2019;n groeiende bewussyn dat &#x2019;n nuwe benadering ten opsigte van die klein sakeman in Suid-Afrika nodig is en dat nuwe stukrag gegee moet word aan die bevordering van klein sake-entrepreneursskap. Hierdie filosofie en benadering het dan ook beslag gekry in die stigting van die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie. Die korporasie is op 3 Februarie vanjaar geregistreer met &#x2019;n teikenkapitaal van R150 miljoen. Net om agb. lede se <span class="col_535-536" refersTo="page_0283"/>geheue te verfris, kan ek daarop wys dat die bedrag van R150 miljoen saamgestel sal word deur R75 miljoen se A aandele wat deur die privaatsektor opgeneem sal word en R75 miljoen se B aandele wat deur die Staat via die NOK as agent opgeneem sal word. Tot dusver het 81 maatskappye reeds R63 miljoen se aandelekapitaal opgeneem waarvan R18 miljoen reeds opbetaal is en die restant oor vyf jaar betaal sal word. Die Staat is van voorneme om sy verpligting ten opsigte van die R75 miljoen na te kom deur &#x2019;n kontantbedrag van R10 miljoen te stort en&#x2014;soos ek gister ook tydens die debat opgemerk het&#x2014;die oordrag van die bates van verskillende korporasies. Ek wil volledigheidshalwe dit weer duidelik stel watter korporasies en belange die Staat van voorneme is om oor te dra aan die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie. Dit is die totale bates van die OFK, die Ontwikke-lings-en Finansieringskorporasie, vroe&#x00EB;r bekend as die Kleurlingontwikkelings-korporasie, die totale bates van die INOK, die klein nywerheidsbates van die NOK en sekere bates van die EOK. Dit word beoog om wetgewing nog tydens hierdie sessie in te dien sodat die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie ook sy infrastruktuur en organisasie op dreef kan kry om die nodige dienste aan die klein sakeman te kan lewer. Ek wil kortliks verwys na enkele van die doelstellings wat die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie homself ten doel stel en waardeur die korporasie hoop om kleinsake-ondernemingskap te bevorder. Die eerste aspek is finansieringshulp by wyse van le-nings of aandelekapitaal op kort, medium of langtermyn. Die tweede aspek is die verskaffing van &#x2019;n sake-infrastruktuur waarbinne die klein sakeman verder kan ontplooi. Dit behels die daarstelling van fabrieke, sake-sentrums ens. &#x2019;n Derde aspek is die ver-skafflng van &#x2019;n praktykgerigte opleidingsad-vies asook nasorgdienste vir die kleinsake-ondernemer. &#x2019;n Laaste aspek is die onderskrywing van lenings en kredietfasili-teite wat deur verskillende bankinstellings aan die klein sakeman verskaf word. Dit staan in die algemeen bekend as die bank-waarborgskema. Die onlangse aanvaarding van hierdie skema deur &#x2019;n groot aantal banke in Suid-Afrika kan as &#x2019;n belangrike deurbraak vir die klein sakeman beskou word. Die skema beoog om deur die uitge breide netwerk van die vyf grootste handels-banke in Suid-Afrika asook hul takke die fasiliteite vir leningskapitaal tot die beskikking van die klein sakeman, ook op die afgele&#x00EB; platteland, beskikbaar te stel.</p>

<p>Teen watter rentekoers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek sal by die renteaspek kom. Na etlike maande van onderhandeling met die betrokke banke, te wete Barclaysbank, Nedbank, Standardbank, Trustbank en Volkskas is daar op hierdie skema ooreengekom. Die skema behels kortliks die volgende: Die banke sal lenings van R25 000 oorweeg wat aan norme wat deur die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie opgestel is, moet voldoen. Die banke sal verantwoor-delik wees vir die verkryging van die nodige sekuriteit terwyl die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie 80&#x0025; van die finansieringsfasiliteit soos ooreengekomsal waarborg. In die gevalle waar die bedrag R25 000 oorskry en tog minder as R150 000 is&#x2014;die perk wat die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie homself voorlopig gestel het&#x2014;sal die banke die aan-soeke na die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie kan verwys vir oorweging. Die korporasie sal eweneens met die goedkeuring van sodanige groter aansoeke 80&#x0025; van die fasiliteit waarborg. Sover my kennis strek is hierdie skema die eerste in sy soort in die w&#x00EA;reld en dit bied &#x2019;n unieke geleent-heid aan die klein sakeman om deur die bank in sy onmiddellike omgewing gehelp te word. Die banke se finansiering van klein sake was tot op hede nog uiters beperk vanwe&#x00EB; die gebrek aan sekuriteit. Die kleiner entrepreneur was tot op hede verplig om by familie, vriende en ander instansies geholpe te raak.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout het dit oor rentekoerse gehad en in daardie verband wil ek net na twee aspekte verwys. Die rentekoers van die Kleinsake-ontwikkelings-korporasie is op die oomblik 14&#x0025;. Die feit van die saak is dat die subsidi&#x00EB;ring van rentekoerse alleen nie die klein sakeman effektief in bedryf sal stel nie. Die belangrike advies-en nasorgdienste asook die bre&#x00EB;r hulp wat deur die korporasie aan die kleiner sakeman gegee sal word, behoort te kompenseer vir meer realistiese rente waardeur fasiliteite aan hom beskikbaar gestel word. Dit is so dat daar agtergeblewe <span class="col_537-538" refersTo="page_0284"/>gemeenskappe is waarvoor aanvanklik meer spesiflek gerigte korporasies ingestel is om hulle ekonomies by te staan. Die belange van hierdie korporasies word nou oorgedra na die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie en daarom ag die Regering dit van die grootste belang dat hierdie bepaalde gemeenskappe en bevolkingsgroepe nie daardeur in &#x2019;n swakker posisie gestel moet word nie. Ek het reeds hierdie aangeleentheid namens die Regering met dr. Vosloo van die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie bespreek en die versekering gekry dat sosioekonomiese oorwegings ook in ag geneem sal word by die toekenning van hulp deur die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie. Daar bestaan by sommige gemeenskappe in ons samelewing &#x2019;n groot ekonomiese agterstand en &#x2019;n mens sal graag wou sien dat die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie meer as sy rol speel om ook ten opsigte van daardie bevolkingsgroepe by te dra om hierdie agterstande uit te wis. Ek wil ook graag &#x2019;n laaste opmerking maak oor die Kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie en dit is dat die korporasie tans in sy vormingsfase is met die daarstelling van sy landswye netwerk. In hierdie stadium kan ek net voornemende aansoekers versoek om die plaaslike takke van die onderskeie banke te nader indien hulle hulp verlang.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag oorgaan na &#x2019;n volgende aspek. Die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt het gisteraand &#x2019;n voorbeeld aangehaal wat hy gebruik het om sy saak te probeer stel dat die Regering onnodige ho&#x00EB; eise en norme aan die ontwikkelaars stel en dit uiteindelik bykans onmoontlik maak vir &#x2019;n nuwe nywerheid om gevestig te word. Hy het dit gedoen aan die hand van &#x2019;n spesifieke voorbeeld. Ek wil nie reageer op sommige insinuasies wat die agb. lid ook ongelukkig gemaak het nie, maar ek wil kortliks sonder om te veel van die tyd van die Komitee in beslag te neem, na hierdie geval verwys. Die aangeleentheid is pas nadat die aansoek in Augustus 1980 ingedien is deur die Komitee van Sewe oorweeg. Hierdie Komitee is &#x2019;n interdeparte-mentele komitee wat juis in die lewe geroep is om aansoeke van hierdie aard te bespoedig. Vir die inligting van die Komitee kan ek net daarop wys dat die lede van die Komitee bestaan uit verteenwoordigers van onder meer die volgende departemente: Nywer-heidswese, wie se verteenwoordiger ook as voorsitter optree, Samewerking en Ontwikkeling, Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewings-bewaring, Mannekrag, Gesondheid, Binne-landse Aangeleenthede en die afdeling Fisiese Beplanning van die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister. Senior amptenare van die onderskeie departemente is in &#x2019;n komitee saamgetrek om aansoeke van daardie aard te oorweeg en te bespoedig. In &#x2019;n besondere geval is die aansoek na die eerste oorweging afgekeur omdat volgens die gidsplan vir die gebied die terrein waarop die nyweraar sy sementaanleg wou oprig vir landboudoel-eindes gesoneer is. Die applikant het weer aansoek gedoen en met die indiening van die tweede aansoek het hy daarop gewys dat &#x2019;n belegging van R150 000 aangegaan is en dat daar reeds bakstene gemaak word sonder enige toestemming. Dit gebeur dikwels dat nyweraars en ander sakelui &#x2019;n reg probeer vestig deur sonder die nodige toestemming op te tree en dan terug te kom na die gemagtigde instansie om kondonering van hul handelswyse te verkry op grond van die feit dat hul reeds kapitaal bestee het. As ons &#x2019;n beleid van ordelike nywerheidsontwikkeling in Suid-Afrika voorstaan, kan &#x2019;n mens nie plakkernywerhede van hierdie aard toelaat nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil met die agb. lid saamstem in soverre hy die punt probeer maak het dat ons nie ons standaarde so hoog moet stel dat dit remmend op die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie inwerk nie. Ek kan nie genoeg daarmee saamstem nie en ek het daarom ook opdrag aan my Departement gegee om deurlopend te kyk na maatre&#x00EB;ls wat kan lei tot die verdere bespoediging van nywerheidsontwikkeling deur die uitskake-Eng van onnodige rondslomp. Aan die anderkant kan ons nie ongeordende ontwikkeling toelaat nie. Wat word nou van die kapitaal wat plaaslike besture aanbied om juis geordende nywerheidsontwikkeling met die nodige dienste in hul gebiede toe te laat? Die feit is ook dat baie nyweraars, as hulle eers toegelaat word om hulself op die periferie of in &#x2019;n ongemagtigde gebied te vestig, kort daarna begin aandring op verdere dienste soos riole, paaie, krag, telefone ens. Die Komitee het weer oor hierdie aangeleentheid besin en die voorsitter asook twee lede van die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister se departement het &#x2019;n inspeksie ter plaatse gaan uitvoer en met die stadsklerk en die stadsingenieur samesprekings gevoer. Persele <span class="col_539-540" refersTo="page_0285"/>is beskikbaar waarop die betrokke nyweraar homself kan vestig. Trouens een ander vervaardiger het homself reeds daar gevestig en &#x2019;n verdere vervaardiger het aangekondig dat hulle binnekort daar tot die bedryf gaan toetree. Die betrokke bedryf het, in die verto&#x00EB; wat hy gerig het om nie na die nywerheidsgebied te verskuif nie, groot klem gel&#x00EA; op die vervoer van die as deur die dorpsgebied. Op die plek waar hy egter tans ongemagtig bakstene vervaardig is hy reeds besig om &#x2019;n roete te volg wanneer hy as aanry wat deur die beboude-gebied gaan. Die Stadsraad, wie se standpunt in hierdie verband ook in ag geneem moet word, is ontsteld dat die Departement nie die ongemagtigde aktiwiteite be&#x00EB;indig het nie. Daarom wil ek weer aan die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat, in &#x2019;n moderne ekonomie, dit noodwendig so is dat nuwe nywerhede aan billike en redelike eise moet voldoen. Ons het in ons Departement &#x2019;n Nuwe Nywerheidskomitee&#x2014;New Industries Committee&#x2014;which is able to assist prospective industrialists and I would suggest that any new industrialist should contact the Committee who will most certainly assist them in overcoming many of the difficulties which the hon. member has referred to last night.</p>

<p>Ek is jammer as die agb. lid nie met my antwoord tevrede is nie. Ek het die bre&#x00EB; filosofie daaragter aan hom probeer uitspel, maar indien hy oor &#x2019;n bepaalde geval verder wil gesels staan my deur altyd oop. Hy moet my net laat weet en dan kan hy die saak verder met my opneem.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal het gisteraand weer na die kwessie van die plaaslike vervaardiging van dieselenjins, rat-kaste en agterasse verwys. Ek het gisteraand in my kort uiteensetting daarop gewys dat dit hoofsaaklik strategiese redes was wat daartoe aanleiding gegee het dat die vervaardiging van hierdie komponente in Suid-Afrika gaan plaasvind. Ek het ook daarop gewys dat ons moet aanvaar dat die plaaslike vervaardigde produk duurder as die ingevoerde produk gaan wees. Miskien moet ek net eers dit s&#x00EA;: Die plaaslike vervaardigde produk sal uiteraard duurder wees omdat die Suid-Afrikaanse mark beperk is. Ons het &#x2019;n kleiner mark en die eenheidskoste is gevolg-lik ho&#x00EB;r as wat dit in die geval van &#x2019;n groter mark vir oorsese vervaardigers sou wees.</p>

<p>How much more?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek kom nou daarby. Hierdie kostepremie is egter veel kleiner as wat algemeen aangevoer word en behoort na &#x2019;n paar jaar relatief gesproke ingehaal te word. Daar is verskillende faktore wat die kostepremie bepaal en ten opsigte waarvan ek nie &#x2019;n spesifieke syfer aan die agb. lid kan verstrek nie. In die eerste instansie is daar die weglatingstoelaag wat bereken moet word op die afslag wat die oorsese vervaardiger aan die binnelandse agent of vervaardiger toelaat ten opsigte van die voertuigpakket wat hy moet aankoop waaruit die enjin nou weggelaat is. Die weggelaat is. Die weglatingstoelaag verskil van vervaardiger tot vervaardiger en dit is dus moeilik om presies te bepaal wat die koste-effek daarvan ten opsigte van die plaaslike dieselenjin sal wees. Daarbenewens is daar nog die kostefaktor van ingenieurswerke want die nodige ingenieurswerk moet gedoen word sodat die plaaslike produk opgeneem kan word in die eenheid, voertuig of trekker. Weer eens mag die koste verskil van vervaardiger tot vervaardiger. Sommige het die voordeel dat die voertuig of die trekker heeltemal geskik is vir die enjin, ratkas of agteras. Dit is dus ook &#x2019;n faktor wat in ag geneem moet word. Sover dit die mededinging op die mark betref wil ek graag die volgende opmerking maak: Die tariefbeskerming van 30&#x0025; word deur baie mense gesien as die kostepremie wat uiteindelik die produk gaan bepaal. In die geval van die swaarder voertuig, byvoorbeeld die vragmotor, is 30&#x0025; op die totale voertuig gevoeg, maar die enjin is verantwoordelik vir ongeveer &#x2019;n kwart van die totale koste van die voertuig. Die tariefbeskerming van 40&#x0025; op trekkers is dus misleidend want dit is nie die persentasie waarteen die binnelandsvervaardigde produk belas sal word nie. Ek het met verskillende vervaardigers laat skakel en veral met trek-kervervaardigers want dit wil my voorkom asof die vrees juis in daardie kring bestaan dat buitensporige ho&#x00EB; premies op trekkers afgewentel sal word. Die aanduiding is dat daar gereken kan word dat die addisionele kostepremie in sommige gevalle maar in die <span class="col_541-542" refersTo="page_0286"/>omgewing van 10&#x0025; kan wees. &#x2019;n Mens moet ook in gedagte hou dat die huidige wisselkoers nie vooruit bepaal kan word nie en die wisselkoersveranderings is inderdaad tans tot die voordeel van die plaaslikvervaardigde produk. Ek wil dus net graag beklemtoon dat ons nie op hol moet raak en moet weg-hardloop oor buitengewone kostepremies waarvan sommige persone praat nie. Sover dit die monopolie-argument betref wil ek graag die volgende kort opmerking maak. Toe daar destyds besluit is om ratkaste plaaslik te vervaardig, was daar reeds &#x2019;n vervaardiger wat vir verdedigingsvoertuie ratkaste en agterasse vervaardig het. Daardie firma het toe oor gevorderde tegnologie, kundigheid en infrastruktuur beskik. Gesien die beperkte omvang van die plaaslike mark, was dit dus logies dat hierdie vervaardiger gevra sou word om met die vervaardiging van ratkaste voort te gaan. Daar is egter ook &#x2019;n ander belangrike aspek en ek wil dit beklemtoon. &#x2019;n Mens wil nie daarmee te koop loop nie, maar ek meen dat die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal dit altyd in gedagte moet hou. Dit is naamlik dat die ander vervaardiger se tegnologie nie tot die beskik-king van die weermag en die polisie was nie en dit was een van die hoofredes waarom aanvanklik besluit is om dieselenjins, ratkaste en agterasse in Suid-Afrika te vervaardig. Ek hoop dus dat hierdie aspek opge-klaar sal word. Dit sluit ook nie uit dat ander vervaardigers in die toekoms toegelaat sal word nie. Voorts is die tariefbeskerming wat aangekondig is van so &#x2019;n aard dat dit die invoer van veral die groter ratkaste, waaroor daar heelwat klagtes was, moontlik maak en dat ons verder vorentoe weer die tariefbeskerming asook die posisie van plaaslike vervaardiging sal kan hersien.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Ceres het die belangrikheid onderstreep dat die inmaakbedryf &#x2019;n struktuuraanpassing moet maak. Ek sou graag enkele syfers wou uitlig om aan te toon dat hierdie struktuuraanpassing nie gesien moet word teen die besondere groot produksie van 1979-&#x2019;80 nie. As &#x2019;n mens byvoorbeeld na die produksie van perskes oor die afgelope aantal jare kyk verg hierdie struktuuraanpassing gemiddeld nie &#x2019;n groter aanpassing as 10 tot 20&#x0025; nie. Ek sal egter hierdie aangeleentheid weer met die agb. lid opneem.</p>

<p>Ek wil my tot die agb. lid vir Worcester rig wat my gisteraand met groot vreugde huistoe gestuur het. Hy het gisteraand gepraat van die gediggie wat lui&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Doctor, I would like to have my throat examined.<br/>There is nothing wrong you say? Who could ever have imagined.<br/>Three farms have flown that way.</block>

<p>Die agb. lid het &#x2019;n besondere betoog gelewer oor die kultuurmuseum in sy omgewing. Hy het ook gepraat oor die stook van witblits en hy het ook gevra dat die reg verleen moet word om die witblits te bemark. Ek is sy betoog baie goedgesind en ons sal graag die agb. lid probeer help binne die raamwerk van die bestaande wetgewing. Ek wil die agb. fid egter daarop wys dat dit veral vanwee kultuurmotiverings is dat ek die saak so goedgesind is. Ons moet egter nie dat die kuituur kop toe gaan nie. Dit laat my dink aan die bekende strofe uit die bekende skrywer Herman Charles Bosman se boek waar hy ook geskryf het van &#x2019;n brousel van ongeveer di&#x00E9; aard. Die agb. lid vir Worcester sal beweer dat dit nie die ware Jakob is nie aangesien dit nie van wyn gemaak word nie, maar dit is Willem Prinsloo se perskebrandewyn waaroor geskryf word en dit is daarna wat Oom Schalk in die storie Willem Prinsloo so droogweg verwys. Ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When I had been in the kitchen for half an hour I decided to go into the voorhuis. It seemed a long way now from the kitchen to the voorhuis and I had to lean against the wall several times to think. I passed a number of other men who were also leaning against the wall like that, thinking. One man even found that he could think best by sitting on the floor with his head on his arms. You could see that Willem Prinsloo made good peach brandy.</block>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die beperkte tyd wat ek nog tot my beskikking het, wil ek kortliks net terugkom op die baie interessante opmerkings van die agb. lid vir Yeoville, wat nou nie vanmiddag hier is nie. Hy het hier in &#x2019;n interessante maar baie kort toesprakie van vyf minute gewys op die gevare van die Marxisme. Hy het in di&#x00E9; verband sekere gevaartekens probeer uitwys. Ek is jammer dat die <span class="col_543-544" refersTo="page_0287"/>agb. lid nie hier is nie. Ek vind dit altyd moeilik om te verstaan dat &#x2019;n lid met soveel perspektief, hom so maklik tuis kan voel in die PFP. Die agb. lid vir Yeoville stel die geheel in perspektief. Hy sien dat die waardes en beskawing van die samelewing in Suid-Afrika deur Marxisme bedreig word, maar die ander agb. lede oorkant het dit altyd teen die NP en die Regering en sy beleid. Ek wens hulle kon net van die agb. lid vir Yeoville leer dat ons werklik in &#x2019;n oorlewingstryd vasgevang is en dat die aansienlike arsenaal van wapens wat in Angola gevind is, nie teen die Regering of sy beleid gemik is nie, maar teen ons beskawing en die waardes en norme waarvoor ons in Suid-Afrika staan.</p>

<p>Laat ons met mekaar verskil in hierdie land. Ek dink dit is goed dat ons ook politieke verskille het. Maar laat ons darem &#x2019;n balans behou en laat ons, wat die groter sake betref, begrip h&#x00EA; van die groter gevare wat ons in Suid-Afrika bedreig, en laat ons daar-die begrip ook aan die kiesers en die bevolking van Suid-Afrika oordra. Feit is dat die Marxisme deur konflik en de-stabiliteit bevorder word. Suid-Afrika het &#x2019;n groot konflikpotensiaal, die konflik van verwagtinge. In baie gevalle is die verwagtinge van die verskillende bevolkingsgroepe gans te hoog. Dit geld ook vir die verwagtinge van die Blankes. Ons sal hierdie verwagtinge met mekaar moet versoen. Ek dink ook dat ons redelikerwyse van ons verwagtinge sal moet inboet as ons op &#x2019;n vreedsame en verantwoordelike manier &#x2019;n toekoms wil skep. Hierdie versoening van verwagtinge kan egter alleen plaasvind indien daar ook &#x2019;n klimaat van vertroue is.</p>

<p>As die agb. lede van die Opposisie en ook baie van hul handlangers daarbuite voortgaan om die Regering af te takel vir alles wat sleg, onaanvaarbaar en die simbool van onreg is, bewys hulle nie die Regering &#x2019;n onguns nie, maar bewys hulle Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n onguns. Hulle breek dan nie die Regering af nie, maar hulle takel die klimaat af van vertroue wat nodig is vir enige positiewe verandering in Suid-Afrika. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons het hier &#x2019;n voorbeeld daarvan gehad. Dit is &#x2019;n ekonomiese debat, en op die ekonomiese terrein probeer ons in groot mate om sonder inagneming van kleur die beleidsas-pekte binne die raamwerk van die bre&#x00EB; politieke beleid uit te voer. Oor die politiek word daar mos in &#x2019;n verkiesing besluit. Laat ons, wanneer dit by &#x2019;n ekonomiese debat kom, binne die raamwerk waaroor die kiesers van Suid-Afrika hulle in geen onduide-like taal uitgespreek het nie, probeer om ons oorhoofse ekonomiese doelwitte te behaal. Om dan hierdie ekonomiese debat te probeer swaai om dit uiteindelik net te benut om &#x2019;n politieke aanval sonder substansie te maak, dien nie die klimaat en gees wat ons in Suid-Afrika nodig het nie, veral nie op ekonomiese gebied nie.</p>

<p>Ek het gisteraand verwys na die vertroue wat dikwels deur die sakesektor geopenbaar word deur die investering en belegging deur daardie sektor in Suid-Afrika. As ons tot &#x2019;n positiewe gees in Suid-Afrika kan bydra en kan wegkom van die d&#x00E9;faitisme wat willens en wetens ook deur &#x2019;n houding van oormatige en selfs oordrewe kritiek geskep word, dink ek dat daar vir ons ook baie meer plusfaktore is in die skepping van &#x2019;n toekoms onder moeilike omstandighede.</p>

<p>&#x2026; wil ek s&#x00EA; dat die vertroue in Suid-Afrika en in die ekonomiese potensiaal van Suid-Afrika ten minste bewys en ge&#x00EF;llustreer word deur die aantal buitelandse beleggers wat in Suid-Afrika bel&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Ja, natuurlik. Laat my egter net op die buitelandse beleggers wys. Binnelands gee die agb. lede oorkant voor dat die hele Suid-Afrika besig is om uitme-kaar te spat, dat Suid-Afrika onder hierdie Regering besig is om homself te vernietig. Hulle het egter nie die billikheid om te wys op die positiewe aspekte, ook op ekonomiese gebied, wat oor die afgelope jare <span class="col_545-546" refersTo="page_0288"/>onder die bewind van hierdie Regering bereik is nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil dus net daarop wys dat die totale private investering in Suid-Afrika vanuit die buiteland reeds meer as R15 miljard beloop. Daar is onder andere 1 200 Britse maatskappye, 375 Amerikaanse maatskappye en 350 Wes-Duitse maatskappye wat aktief in Suid-Afrika bedrywig is, en die meeste van hierdie ondernemings is deurlopend besig om hul bestaande beleggings te vergroot, hul kapasiteit uit te brei en deur hul ekonomiese aktiwiteite hul vertroue in die toekoms van Suid-Afrika uit te spreek. [Tussenwerpsels.] Laat ons met mekaar ooreenkom om aan die toekoms van Suid-Afrika te glo en om in belang van Suid-Afrika te probeer om ook in ons besprekings en debatte van hierdie aard die vertroue te skep waarbinne Suid-Afrika positief kan ontwikkel.</p>

<p>Ek sou graag nog by vele ander sprekers terugkom en enkele opmerkings oor ons handelooreenkoms met Zimbabwe wou maak, maar die tyd laat dit nie toe nie. Ek wil net ten slotte graag s&#x00EA; dat my kollega, die agb. Adjunk-minister, in meer besonder-hede sal antwoord op die debat oor toerisme. Ek het hom gevra om in die besonder sy aandag ook te skenk aan die toerisme-aktiwiteite van die departement. Dit moet in geen opsig gesien word asof die belange van toerisme daarmee op &#x2019;n syspoor gerangeer word nie. Inteendeel, die bedoeling is juis dat ons gesamentlik meer tyd vir toerisme beskikbaar sal h&#x00EA; en daardeur groter aandag sal kan skenk aan hierdie uiters belangrike aspek van die Suid-Afrikaanse sakelewe. Dit is &#x2019;n aktiwiteit wat meer bereik as om net vir ons belangrike buitelandse kapitaal te verdien. Saam met al die voordele van indiensneming, die ontwikkeling van die land, enso-voorts, het toerisme ook nog die voordeel dat die toeris in Suid-Afrika na sy eie land terugkeer met &#x2019;n beter begrip van Suid-Afrika, sy mense en sy omstandighede. Ons is &#x2019;n gekompliseerde land, maar ons het &#x2019;n geweldige toeristepotensiaal. Laat ons dit ontwikkel deur, wat die openbare en private sektore betref, ons kragte saam te span om daardeur ook vir Suid-Afrika in die bre&#x00EB; &#x2019;n diens te bewys. Ek dank hom graag vir die spesifieke aandag wat hy aan toerisme sal gee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. M. ANDREW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I address myself to the subject of tourism, I would like to respond to a few of the remarks made by the hon. the Minister, specifically those towards the end of his speech when he spoke of the dangers of Marxism. There is no probleem involved in convincing this party that there are dangers of Marxism in South Africa. The debate is about what encourages Marxism and what discourages it. I would suggest that denying the people of South Africa equal opportunities and maintaining racial discrimination in all its aspects are two of the factors that will encourage Marxism and not fight it.</p>

<p>One particular statement by the hon. the Minister illustrated this rather well. Referring to the political aspects, he said that the voters of South Africa have spoken and have elected the NP to power. In that he is perfectly correct. Where he is quite wrong is that the people of South Africa have not spoken. Only a section of the people of South Africa are able to speak via the ballot box in the forums of power.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also referred to the need for trust in South Africa. Again one would agree with him, but let him not forget that in the sphere of tourism it has been said that the Soweto riots set us back five years. The Cilli&#x00E9; Commission, if one cuts away the bits and pieces, in the end said that apartheid was the cause of the Soweto riots. I think we should look at such things.</p>

<p>On a non-political basis, I was most disappointed that the hon. the Minister ducked the issue of business development in the informal sector, because I believe that this is going to be an important feature of the South African economy in the future. I only hope that the Government will not take as long to come round to discovering the importance of this as it has taken to come round to discovering the importance of siteand-service housing schemes, a concept the Government now promotes as if it invented it.</p>

<from><span class="col_547-548" refersTo="page_0289"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. M. ANDREW</person>:</from>

<p>To move on to tourism, I believe it is correct to congratulate both the hon. the Minister and his Deputy as they are involved in tourism for the first time. As with many other portfolios, it is unfortunate that this hon. Minister is the sixth Minister in as many years handling this portfolio. I hope this trend will not continue, because this portfolio deserves more attention.</p>

<p>We have three reports before us, those of the Hotel Board, Satour and the department itself, all of which contain useful information. I do, however, think it is rather disappointing that, while it is now September 1981, the most recent report of the department which is available to us is the one for the year 1979. I think that bringing out a more up to date report could be given greater priority.</p>

<p>Those of us from Cape Town were a bit alarmed to learn a few years ago that the headquarters of the Navy were to be moved to Pretoria, but on reading the report of Satour, I discovered something which as a parochial Capetonian I did not know, namely that visitors arriving in 1980 by sea included two from Lesotho, eight from Swaziland and 280 from Zimbabwe. Perhaps, as a spokesman on tourism, I should travel more and discover the new sea routes to South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, three statements in the annual report of Satour make for striking reading. The first is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">World tourism today is one of the major items of international trade, having grown at a faster rate over the past few years than world trade in goods.</block>

<p>The second statement is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Past growth performances indicate that tourism might become the world&#x2019;s biggest industry by the end of the century.</block>

<p>The third is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is one of the most attractive tourist destinations in the world.</block>

<p>I agree with all three of those statements.</p>

<p>Tourism is big business and it has the potential of becoming one of the biggest growth industries in South Africa. In Britain, for example, tourism, with its associated industries, is the single biggest employer. Tourism is already a major foreign-exchange earner for South Africa. In 1979 it amounted to R402 million&#x2014;more than the export earnings of maize, wool, sugar, or cut and polished diamonds. I think that that gives one an idea of how important tourism has become to this country. In 1980 foreign-exchange earnings increased by 18,4&#x0025; over the previous year to a record R476 million. This rate of increase was almost double that of our merchandise exports. Our potential for further growth is enormous. Foreign tourism accounts for less than 1&#x0025; of our gross domestic product, compared with nearly 2&#x0025; in the United Kingdom and nearly 4&#x0025; in Kenya. Spain, for example, gets 34 million tourists per annum, nearly one tourist per resident. South Africa has been lagging behind the rest of the world in tourism growth, and it has been doing far worse than some countries, notably a country such as Australia.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast with the potential and importance of the tourist industry to South Africa is the pittance that we spend promoting this country overseas. The grant-in-aid to Satour, which accounts for the major part of the money appropriated, amounts to only R7,94 million for 1981-&#x2019;82, an increase of only 10,3&#x0025; over last year and considerably less than the rate of inflation. Thus the amount of work that is going to be done will be less. This penny-pinching is short-sighted and counter-productive. Expenditure on the promotion of tourism to South Africa is an important investment&#x2014;it is not an extravagance.</p>

<p>Money spent by tourists visiting South Africa is a bonus for many businesses. On a marginal costing basis, tourism contributes disproportionately to the profitability of many enterprises and therefore the Exchequer reaps the benefits. The Government must get at least R50 million per year in various taxes as a direct result of foreign visitors. Surely, it makes sense to invest more than a meagre R7,9 million in the growth of this industry. In 1978 the Department of Tourism had only 10 employees in North America, and South Africa was spending less than Greece, Ireland, Singapore, Spain and Australia in promoting <span class="col_549-550" refersTo="page_0290"/>tourism in that area. Spain, for example, was spending seven times as much as South Africa in promoting tourism in North America. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister what the position is now. Has our competitive position improved in this regard?</p>

<p>Fluctuations are a continual probleem for the tourist industry. On a seasonal basis there was a variation in 1980 in terms of foreign visitors of 106&#x0025;, ranging from 41 000 in June to 84 000 in December. On the basis of a longer term, in the last decade we had growth to a high of 730 000 in 1975, then a drop to 589 000 in 1977 and growth again to 703 000 in 1980. In other words, there were variations of up to 24&#x0025;. Thirdly, the industry has to cope with major currency fluctuations. Over the last decade variations in exchange rates of the three main currencies involved in tourism included a variation of 30&#x0025; in the US dollar, 39&#x0025; in the British pound and no less than 162&#x0025; in the DM. This causes massive problems for the tourist industry. Hence we found that in early 1978 there was what was described as &#x201C;a glut of hotel beds&#x201D;, while less than two years later, in late 1979, there were no beds available.</p>

<p>The keys to rapid growth in South Africa&#x2019;s tourist industry lie in providing suitable accommodation and transport, both internal and external. It is essential that we coordinate our activities and show more imagination than in the past. I call on the hon. the Minister to take the initiative in developing a tourist industry plan or blueprint for South Africa. It is urgently required. The Government and its departments, particularly the Airways and the Railways, should give a firm commitment as to their intentions so that private enterprise can plan accordingly. Our biggest disadvantage is the cost involved in getting to South Africa and travelling around in South Africa. We must look at providing visitors&#x2019; travel passes, student concessions, charters, more competition in road transportation, and so on.</p>

<p>There are two areas of concern I would like to discuss. The one is that our environment is precious and irreplaceable and is the main attraction for visitors. We must ensure that the growth in tourism does not in any way destroy our natural heritage. The second area of concern which I think the hon. the Minister ought to look at, is that we must realize that we live in a multi-racial world. A successful tourist industry is going to have to cater for all races. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mnr. G. C. du <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLESSIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil begin deur kortliks te verwys na sekere opmerkings van die agb. lid wat nou net gaan sit het. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die Sowetoonluste &#x2019;n invloed op ons toerisme gehad het. Dit is waar. Dit is waar dat die toeristebedryf &#x2019;n baie sensitiewe bedryf is. Nou wil ek darem ook vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat hy hom so &#x2019;n bietjie rekenskap moet gee van d&#x00ED;t wat deur agb. lede oorkant in die Raad ges&#x00EA; word wat na buite uitgedra word en wat juis &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol speel om toerisme hier weg te skrik. As &#x2019;n mens na die uitsprake luister wat van tyd tot tyd van daardie kant van die Raad kom, is dit vir my verbasend dat daar nog mense is wat bereid is om na Suid-Afrika te kom.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil ook van hier-die geleentheid gebruik maak om die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister van harte geluk te wens met hul behartiging van hierdie baie belangrike portefeulje. Ek wil hulle baie jare in hierdie departement toewens want ek dink daar is &#x2019;n groot behoefte daaraan dat mense hulle hulle in die departement sal ingrawe. Aangesien albei van hulle nog jonk is, hoop ons ons sal hulle vir baie jare hier by ons h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Ek glo dat ons almal wat vandag hier bymekaar is, dit eens is dat toerisme &#x2019;n baie groot en belangrike nywerheid in hierdie land en in enige land van die w&#x00EA;reld is. Dit is so dat daar mense is wat beweer dat die oliebedryf wat vandag die grootste bedryf is, voor die einde van die eeu deur die toeriste-bedryf oorskadu sal word. Die <i>International Tourism Journal</i> beweer dat 285 miljoen mense verlede jaar hul land van woning as toeriste verlaat het. In die jaarverslag word daar vir ons ges&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n bedrag van 638 biljoen dollar in vreemde lande bestee word, afgesien van mense se reisgeld. Suid-Afrika het in 1980 aan toerisme R476 miljoen aan vreemde valuta verdien. Weer sluit dit nie eens die reisgeld in nie. Ek dink dit is dus &#x2019;n baie goeie besigheid. &#x2019;n Mens bel&#x00EA; R9 miljoen om R476 miljoen te verdien. Ek weet nie van &#x2019;n beter besigheid nie. Binnelandse toerisme het ook &#x2019;n groot oplewing getoon. Dit het saamgeval met ons ekonomiese oplewing en die betrokke bedrag was R920 <span class="col_551-552" refersTo="page_0291"/>miljoen. Dit het op sy beurt ons ekonomie &#x2019;n baie belangrike inspuiting gegee.</p>

<p>Toeristebesteding het &#x2019;n vermenigvuldigende uitwerking wat ekonomiese groei in die gasheergemeenskap bewerkstellig, onder meer in die vorm van werkverskaffing. Toerisme staan nooit alleen of in isolasie nie, maar be&#x00EF;nvloed elke sektor van die ekonomie. Ek glo nie dat ons werklik besef wat toerisme vir &#x2019;n land soos Suid-Afrika kan beteken nie. Ons het hier &#x2019;n ontsettende groot potensiaal, terwyl ons goud en minerale rykdom baie belangrike bates is, is dit in werklikheid kwynende bates. Die goud word minder, die diamante word minder, die steenkool word minder, die uraan word minder en die dag sal ook aanbreek wanneer dit alles opraak. Toerisme daarenteen lewer &#x2019;n onuitputlike verdienste solank ons ons natuurbates goed versorg en dit nie misbruik word nie. Daar stem ek met die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine saam. Dit is egter op voorwaarde dat ons betyds deeglik vir die toekoms beplan.</p>

<p>Die belang van buitelandse toeriste wat ons land besoek, kan egter ook nie net in geldwaarde gemeet word nie omdat bykans elke toeris ook &#x2019;n selfaangestelde ambassadeur vir Suid-Afrika word. Die meeste toeriste gaan huis toe met die gedagte dat hulle baie graag sal wil terugkom.</p>

<p>In die verlede het ons ons miskien oormatig toegespits op bo-gemiddelde en gegoede besoekers, byvoorbeeld bestuurders, professionele mense, mense wat vir hulself werk en in die algemeen die meningsvormers wie se invloed baie wyd uitkring. Ek wil graag later in my toespraak op hierdie bepaalde aspek terugkom.</p>

<p>In die afgelope boekjaar het 702 794 toeriste Suid-Afrika besoek. As hierdie tendens voortduur, sal ons in die nie te verre toekoms selfs &#x2019;n miljoen toeriste na Suid-Afrika kan trek mits omstandighede gunstig bly. Die vraag wat by &#x2019;n mens opkom, is of ons in staat sal wees om daardie mense te kan ontvang. Ons weet daar is reeds ernstige knelpunte wat aandag sal moet kry. Daar bestaan reeds &#x2019;n huisvestingsprobleem. Veral in ons groot stede het ons nie voldoende hotelle om in die behoefte te voorsien nie. &#x2019;n Mens dink aan die posisie in Johannesburg of Kaapstad. Ons eie binne-landse toerisme beset reeds ten volle die meeste van ons hotelle en ons gewilde vakansie-oorde. Selfs in hierdie laat stadium het ons nog nie daarin geslaag om ons provinsies sover te kry om te re&#x00EB;l dat mense se vakansies nie almal saamval nie. Dit affekteer ook ons binnelandse trein-en lugdienste wat sekere tye van die jaar ten volle beset is. Om met die Bloutrein te ry, moet &#x2019;n mens 12 maande vooruitbespreek. Dit is die probleme wat ons in die gesig staar en waarna ons sal moet kyk.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander aspek waarop ek wil wys. Die waarde van massa-toerisme moet ook betyds raakgesien word. Daar is groot groepe jong mense wat graag die w&#x00EA;reld wil sien maar beslis nie vyfsterhotelle kan bekostig nie. Eintlik was hierdie mense in die verlede nie baie welkom nie. Vandag se jong man is dikwels more se ryk man. Dus moet daar ook omgesien word na die behoeftes van die toeris wat nie ryk is nie. In Europa kan toeriste verskeie konsessies kry waarna reeds verwys is. In die VSA het ek gebruik gemaak van &#x2019;n skema waarvolgens &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n afslag van 40&#x0025; van die binnelandse tarief kry as jy jou kaartjie buite die VSA koop. Ons sal baie meer in hierdie rigting moet dink.</p>

<p>Daar sal baie beslis ook aandag gegee moet word aan toeristebusdienste oor lang afstande. Ons het die natuurskoon, ons het die onoortreflike klimaat en ons het besienswaardighede in oorvloed. Ons moet net die infrastruktuur vir toerisme skep.</p>

<p>Ek wil nog &#x2019;n ander probleemuitlig waarna ek glo ook gekyk moet word. Ek het reeds daarna verwys dat ek dankbaar is dat die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunkminister albei jong manne is. Oor die afgelope vyf jaar het ses verskillende Ministers hierdie portefeulje behartig. Ek glo nie dit was vir toerisme goed nie. Dit is nie dat ek dit wil kritiseer nie, maar dit is &#x2019;n belangrike feit wat &#x2019;n mens in die gesig moet staar. Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister die tyd gegun sal word om hul deeglik in te grawe en besondere aandag aan hierdie departement te skenk. Ek dink die agb. Minister was op die regte pad toe hy onlangs, volgens &#x2019;n koerantberig, in Athene ges&#x00EA; het dat, waar die Kommissie vir Administrasie besig is om ondersoek in te stel na die Regering se funksies in verband met toerisme, hy dit oorweeg om &#x2019;n komitee in te stel waarin die Regering en verbruikersliggame van die private sektor <span class="col_553-554" refersTo="page_0292"/>kan saamwerk aan die be planning van die toeristebedryf vir die toekoms. Ek dink dit is hoog tyd dat dit gedoen word en ek dink dit is &#x2019;n baie goeie stap in die regte rigting.</p>

<p>Daar is nog &#x2019;n ander saak wat ek wil uitlig. Dit het betrekking op &#x2019;n knelpunt in ons intemasionale reklame. Die begroting vir intemasionale reklame het oor vier tot vyf jaar feitlik dieselfde gebly. Nogtans was daar in daardie periode &#x2019;n geweldige inflasiefaktor op die gebied van die media van bykans 70&#x0025;. Dit beteken in die praktyk dat om dieselfde reklameblootstelling te h&#x00EA; wat ons vyf jaar gelede gehad het, ons reklamebegroting met minstens 70&#x0025; verhoog sal moet word. Destyds het ons reklame in die buiteland bestaan uit volkleur-advertensies wat &#x2019;n dubbelblad beslaan het. Geleidelik het dit volkleur-advertensies wat &#x2019;n enkelblad beslaan het, geword, en tans bestaan dit uit advertensies in swart en wit wat twee kolomme beslaan. As ons reklamepoging gesien word teen die derduisende kolomme negatiewe publisiteit, dan kan enige mens aflei dat ons nie baie effektief kan wees nie. Die ironie van die saak is dat dit nie &#x2019;n kwessie van miljoene rande is wat benodig word om hierdie saak reg te stel nie. Ek dink dat ons met R1 miljoen tot R1,5 miljoen baie maklik daardie probleem sal kan oorbrug. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is vir my baie aangenaam om ná die agb. lid vir Kempton Park aan die beurt te kom, aangesien hy, net soos ek, baie belang stel in die mooi bedryf van toerisme. Voordat ek my paar gedagtes oor hierdie onderwerp opper, wil ek net die agb. Adjunk-minister opreg bedank vir die verklaring wat hy gisteraand gedoen het oor weermodifikasie. Ek is baie dankbaar om te verneem dat die verskillende instansies wat daarby betrokke is, nou geko&#x00F6;rdineer sal word. Dit kan net tot voordeel van hierdie baie belangrike aangeleentheid strek.</p>

<p>Dit is vir my &#x2019;n baie groot voorreg en baie aangenaam om die voorsitter en die beheerraad van Satoer van harte geluk te wens met &#x2019;n baie goeie en insiggewende verslag wat op 4 September in die Parlement ter tafel gel&#x00EA; is. Dit mag die agb. lede interesseer om te weet dat Satoer op 1 Augustus 1947 kragtens &#x2019;n Wet van die Parlement ingestel is. In daardie Wet word sy hoofoogmerk soos volg omskryf&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Om die toeristebedryf van die Republiek te ontwikkel deur persone aan te moedig om die Republiek van elders te besoek en om daarin rond te reis.</block>

<p>Nou is dit so, Meneer&#x2014;en ek stem saam met die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine&#x2014;dat die feit dat Suid-Afrika een van die aantreklikste toeristebestemmings ter w&#x00EA;reld is, en die feit dat w&#x00EA;reldtoerisme een van die vernaamste items in internasionale handel is, wat gedurende die afgelope jaar teen &#x2019;n vinniger tempo as w&#x00EA;reldhandel in goedere gegroei het, die belangrikheid van toerisme en die belangrikheid van &#x2019;n liggaam soos die Suid-Afrikaanse Toeristekorporasie beklemtoon. Vandag bemark Satoer Suid-Afrika as &#x2019;n belangrike internasionale toeristebestemming in 35 lande. Satoer het 15 takkantore en een verteenwoordiging oorsee, en die opening van bykomende kantore word gedurende 1981 in die vooruitsig gestel. Onafhanklike opnames in die oorsese bedryf bevestig dat Satoer &#x2019;n belangrike en positiewe rol speel in sy ondersteuning van die oorsese bedryf in lande wat toeriste lewer om Suid-Afrika aan hulle kli&#x00EB;nte te bemark. Dit is baie interessant dat gedurende 1980 die w&#x00EA;reldbesteding aan internasionale toerisme &#x2019;n geraamde 638 biljoen dollar bereik het, &#x2019;n toename van 10&#x0025; in vergelyking met die totaal vir 1979.</p>

<p>In baie lande is toerisme &#x2019;n waardevolle verdiener van vreemde valuta, en die verdienste hieruit het dikwels &#x2019;n merkbare invloed op die betalingsbalans. Die groeikoers in die verlede dui daarop dat toerisme teen die einde van die eeu moontlik die w&#x00EA;reld se grootste bedryf kan word.</p>

<p>Die ekonomiese voordele van toerisme strek verder as die reisbedryf self op grond daarvan dat besoekersbesteding oor die totale ekonomie van &#x2019;n land versprei word. Toerismebesteding het ook &#x2019;n vermenigvuldigende uitwerking wat ekonomiese groei in die gasheergemeenskap bewerkstellig. Die bedryf is op beide direkte en indirekte wyse &#x2019;n betekenisvolle verskaffer van werkgeleenthede. Die toerisme-infrastruktuur van &#x2019;n land is nie &#x2019;n entiteit op sigself of ge&#x00EF;soleerd nie, maar be&#x00EF;nvloed bykans elke aspek van ekonomiese aktiwiteit. Toerisme dra dus by <span class="col_555-556" refersTo="page_0293"/>tot die voorsiening en verbetering van baie geriewe vir die plaaslike bevolking, wat baie belangrik is.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, daar is ook ander belangrike voordele wat uit toerisme voortvloei, en ek wil graag twee daarvan noem. Dit bewerkstellig &#x2019;n beter begrip van die leefwyse van ander volke en hulle instellings, en tweedens skep dit welwillendheid ten opsigte van &#x2019;n land en help dit om &#x2019;n gunstige beeld te projekteer.</p>

<p>Daar word bereken dat Suid-Afrika se verdienste aan vreemde valuta uit internasionale toerisme gedurende 1980 R476 miljoen beloop het. Dit sluit nie die inkomste uit lugvervoer na en van die Republiek in nie. Dit is &#x2019;n rekordinkomste, en 18,4&#x0025; meer as die syfer van R402 miljoen gedurende 1979. Afgesien van hierdie monet&#x00EA;re voordeel, is oorsese toeriste oor die algemeen ook goeie ambassadeurs vir die Republiek wanneer hulle na hul onderskeie lande terugkeer.</p>

<p>Tussentydse voorspellings vir 1980 dui op &#x2019;n afname in die groeikoers van toerisme in die meeste lande as gevolg van die ho&#x00EB;r pryse wat deur w&#x00EA;reldinflasie veroorsaak word. In baie toonaangewende toeristelande word geen groei of selfs &#x2019;n afname in die groeikoers verwag. Ten spyte hiervan, was 1980 die tweede beste jaar vir toerisme na Suid-Afrika deurdat die aankomstesyfer van 700 000 vir die eerste keer sedert 1975 oorskry is. Meneer, dit is voorwaar &#x2019;n prestasie vir ons land en dit bevestig weer eens die feit dat Suid-Afrika een van die aantreklikste toeristebestemmings ter w&#x00EA;reld is.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek is baie bly om te meld dat daar baie goeie samewerking bestaan tussen die agb. Minister en Adjunk-minister van Nywerheidswese, Handel en Toerisme, die Departement, Satoer, en alle ander instansies wat direk met toerisme gemoeid is. Ek merk ook op uit die verslag dat daar jaarliks &#x2019;n intemasionale bemarkingskonferensie gehou word en dat die betrokke owerhede ook op hierdie konferensie verteenwoordig word. Terloops, mnr. die Voorsitter, die vorige konferensie is gedurende 1980 in die baie mooi Oos-Vrystaat gehou, nl. by die Golden Gatehoogland Nasionale Park. Tydens hierdie konferensie is daar belangrike besluite geneem, en wil ek net so &#x2019;n paar hier noem.</p>

<p>Daar is besluit om groter nadruk op open bare skakelaktiwiteite te l&#x00EA; ten einde &#x2019;n meer gunstige oorsese bemarkingsklimaat te skep. Dit is baie belangrik, want as ons die getal toeriste wat Suid-Afrika besoek kan verhoog na een miljoen per jaar, kan toerisme die tweede of derde grootste verdiener van buitelandse valuta vir Suid-Afrika word. Tweedens, met inagneming van die plaaslike vakansiepatroon, het die vergadering die absolute noodsaaklikheid daarvan ingesien om die opeenhoping van toeristeverkeer in sekere gebiede gedurende die spitsseisoen te help verlig, deur meer oorsese toeriste aan te moedig om Suid-Afrika gedurende Mei tot September te besoek. Voornemende toeriste moet ook aangeraai word om die minder bekende maar aantreklike gebiede van die land wat in staat is om in die behoeftes van die oorsese mark te voorsien, te besoek, wat net so belangrik is. Derdens, in die lig van die sukses van die eerste intemasionale werkwinkel vir oorsese toeroperateurs, wat gedurende Maart 1980 in Johannesburg gehou is, het die vergadering saamgestem dat hierdie program voortgesit en moontlik uitgebrei behoort te word.</p>

<p>Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat hierdie belangrike besluite met groot welslae ge&#x00EF;mplementeer sal word tot voordeel van hierdie baie mooi bedryf, nl. toerisme.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. M. ANDREW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am glad that hon. members opposite, like the hon. member for Ladybrand who has just spoken, share the enthusiasm that I have about the potential of tourism, and also that they have expressed concern about the totally inadequate budget allocated to Satour to do its job.</p>

<p>I was mentioning earlier that while I think there is great potential in tourism, there are two particular areas that we have to watch out for. The one is that we do not spoil our environment in the process of promoting tourism, and the second is that we must bear in mind that we live in a multi-racial world, and that a successful tourist industry is going to have to cater for all races, particularly when one is involved in congresses and similar events. We are going to have to cater for those races without having to resort to the obtaining of obnoxious permits. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty to ensure that visitors to this country are not insulted.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, tourism holds out tremendous <span class="col_557-558" refersTo="page_0294"/>prospects for South Africa. It earns us foreign exchange, it provides employment for thousands and it can increase understanding of our problems, but one gets nothing for nothing and I call on the Government to increase its grant to Satour substantially, to ensure that South Africa is properly promoted and to initiate the drawing up of a tourist industry plan as soon as possible, a plan for the future of the industry, which does not simply involve looking at current problems in South Africa, so that we can have a co-ordinated approach to the enormous opportunities that present themselves.</p>

<p>To turn to a more specific matter, I wish to refer to tourism in the Western Cape. Over the last decade the economy of the Western Cape has performed worse than any other major metropolitan area of South Africa. While the level of economic activity grew by between 29&#x0025; and 32&#x0025; in Pretoria, Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth, and by 31&#x0025; in the Republic as a whole, it grew by only 17&#x0025; in Cape Town from 1970 to 1980. It is clear that the Western Cape needs all the help that it can get to boost its economic growth, but when it comes to one of its most important industries&#x2014; tourism&#x2014;which is said to account for something like R50 million per year in this area, the Government discriminates against the Western Cape.</p>

<p>In the first place, the Western Cape is South Africa&#x2019;s major tourist attraction and the United Kingdom is the biggest source of visitors to South Africa. But what do we find? There are 28 flights per week between London and Johannesburg, four per week between London and Durban, but only two per week between London and Cape Town.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position as far as South African Airways is concerned. In the financial year 1980-&#x2019;81 S.A.A.&#x2019;s Cape Town-London flights were 86,5&#x0025; full compared with 72,6&#x0025; for the Johannesburg-London flights, and this has been the pattern for the past three years. If one bears in mind that many of the empty seats were in the first-class section, and that a traveller has no choice of days if he flies to or from Cape Town, there is obviously an excess of demand over supply for direct flights from Cape Town to London.</p>

<p>Secondly, the air route distance between Cape Town and London is less than that from Johannesburg to London, and yet a tourist pays R184,10 more to fly to Cape Town on a 14 to 90 day special excursion ticket than he pays to fly to Johannesburg. This amounts to 16&#x0025; to 18&#x0025; extra, depending on whether it is high or low season. In Cape Town, as was mentioned by a colleague of mine last night, we also do not have a proper international airport.</p>

<p>This unjustified discrimination against Cape Town should be stopped. It discourages visitors from basing their holidays in the Western Cape and results in many visitors not even coming to this area. In the interests of the tourist industry and of the economic development of the Western Cape, I ask the hon. the Minister to make urgent representations within the Cabinet to ensure, firstly, that more London to Cape Town direct flights are scheduled; secondly, that London to Cape Town air fares are reduced to the same level as London to Johannesburg fares; and thirdly, that full international airport facilities are provided in Cape Town as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil aan die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine baie dankie s&#x00EA; dat hy oor vervoer in die toerisme gepraat het. Ek wil ook daarna verwys, maar voordat ek daarby kom, wil ek met die agb. lid vir Constantia &#x2019;n appeltjie skil. Die agb. lid is ongelukkig nie hier nie, maar ek sou graag met hom wou gepraat het. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat ons buite die partypolitieke verband oor hierdie aangeleentheid moet praat, maar nou het hy dit goedgevind om nie vanmiddag hier te wees nie. Miskien sal die agb. majoor aan hom oordra wat ek te s&#x00EA; het. Die agb. lid vir Constantia het hier te kere gegaan en Constantia se &#x201E;10-punt-plan&#x201D; bespreek. &#x201E;Hulley&#x2019;s 10-point plan&#x201D; is wat dit ook genoem is&#x2014;ons kan dit enige naam noem. Die agb. lid het almal geblameer vir die huidige swak vertoning van die ekonomie in Wes-Kaapland, en die agb. lid vir Tuine het daarop voortgeborduur. Die agb. lid vir Constantia het die skuld probeer pak op die Regering, op apartheid, op die Minister van Nywerheids-wese, Handel en Toerisme, op die Adjunk-minister en op die Nasionale Party, maar ek sien dit anders. Waarom groei Wes-Kaapland nie? Wes-Kaapland groei nie <span class="col_559-560" refersTo="page_0295"/>omdat, soos die agb. Minister van Same werking en Ontwikkeling dit gestel het, daar &#x2019;n georkestreerde poging was tot plakkery en wat daarmee gepaard gaan. Dit is dinge soos daardie wat die arbeidsmark hier onstabiel maak. Dit is waarom nyweraars nie hierheen kom nie.</p>

<p>Daardie mense stelnie daarin belang om hierheen te kom as daar nie &#x2019;n arbeidsmag is wat hulle kan vertrou nie. Voordat agb. lede van die Opposisie weer begin skree, soos die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine nou skree, moet hulle daaraan dink dat hulle daarvoor verantwoordelik is dat hierdie plek nie groei nie.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil vra dat waar toerisme in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n belangrike rol speel, maar, wat my betref, in die toekoms heelwat minder belangrik sal wees omdat toeriste uit Zimbabwe wat die grootste deel gevorm het van toeriste vanuit die buiteland, minder word, daar verder na hierdie saak gekyk sal word. Die heel belangrikste vir my in hierdie stadium is om voorsiening te maak daarvoor dat toeriste van oorsee gelok kan word. Ek wil nie vanmiddag praat oor toerisme in Suid-Afrika wat binnelands opgewek word nie; ek wil my hoofsaaklik toespits op toeriste wat van die buiteland af kom. Die voordele daarvan en wat dit alles inhou, is reeds deur vorige sprekers bespreek, en ek dink nie dit is nodig dat ons weer kyk na wat noodsaaklik is om toerisme in Suid-Afrika binnelands op te wek, en wat die voordele daarvan is nie. Ek wil egter een punt uitsonder, nl. vervoer. Dit is &#x2019;n saak wat ook by die kongres in Athene uitgesonder is.</p>

<p>Vervoer is uitgesonder as een van die kernprobleme wat daartoe bydra dat toerisme in Suid-Afrika probleme ondervind. Ek wil saamstem met die agb. Minister dat vervoer &#x2019;n probleem is. Hierdie punt kan ook met vrug bespreek word onder die Begrotingspos van die agb. Minister van Vervoerwese, maar ek dink dit sal miskien goed wees as ons by hierdie geleentheid ook kyk na wat op die gebied van vervoer gedoen kan word om buitelandse toeriste te trek. Een van die belangrikste aspekte hiervan, soos ook deur die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine genoem is, is die kwessie van koste. Ek wil aan u s&#x00EA;, Meneer, dat vervoer op sigself nie veel ten opsigte van daardie koste kan doen nie. Daardie koste sal op &#x2019;n ander manier verlaag moet word. Vir die buitelandse toeris wat Suid-Afrika besoek, verteenwoordig vervoerkoste gemiddeld ongeveer 50&#x0025; van sy totale koste, en dit is gans te hoog. Plus-minus 40&#x0025; van sy onkoste bestaan uit die koste van sy heenreis en die koste van sy terugkeer na sy land van oorsprong, terwyl hy verder ongeveer 12&#x0025; moet uitgee om vervoer binnelands te koop. Daardie syfer van 50&#x0025; is te hoog, en ek wil voorstel dat iets hieraan gedoen word, sodat daardie syfer meer in ooreenstemming gebring kan word met die internasionale standaard, waarvolgens &#x2019;n passasier nie meer as &#x2019;n maksimum van een-derde van sy spandeerbare geld vir &#x2019;n vakansie op vervoerkoste uitgee nie.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. WELGEMOED</person>:</from>

<p>Ek wil aan die dierbare majoor s&#x00EA; dat as jy aan Freddie Laker &#x2019;n lisensie gee, die toeriste almal tot in Johannesburg sal kom, en nie tot in Kaapstad nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil verder s&#x00EA; dat die toeristemark ten opsigte van die langer afstande, bv. toeriste uit Wes-Europa, Noord-Amerika en die Verre Ooste, in die toekoms ontgin sal moet word deur die vervoerkoste te verlaag. Daar bestaan verskeie moontlikhede om hierdie vervoerkoste te verlaag, en ek wil slegs enkeles behandel.</p>

<p>Die eerste, wat vir my persoonlik belangrik is, is dat die koste van brandstof verlaag sal moet word. Op die oomblik verteen-woordig brandstofkoste tussen 35&#x0025; en 40&#x0025; van die lugrederye se totale koste. Daardie bedrag is te hoog, en ek wil die agb. Minister vra of hy nie met die Minister van Energiesake sal praat om &#x2019;n toegewing in hierdie verband aan die intemasionale lugrederye toegestaan te kry nie. Sekere oorsese lugrederye, by name die Amerikaanse en Suid-Amerikaanse lugrederye, stel nie meer daarin belang om Suid-Afrika toe te kom nie, omdat die koste van brandstof hier te hoog is. Dit het ook &#x2019;n effek op die getal passasiers na en van Suid-Afrika, en veral op die getalle toeriste. Daar is verskillende tegnieke wat gebruik kan word om sake vir die <span class="col_561-562" refersTo="page_0296"/>toeris op die gebied van vervoer te vergemaklik. Soos die agb. lid vir Kemptonpark voorgestel het, kan daar bv. &#x2019;n kaartjie be-skikbaar gestel word wat hoofsaaklik gebruik kan word vir reise buite spitstye. Die reisiger, in hierdie geval die toeris, sal dan wel van lugreise gebruik kan maak met &#x2019;n kaartjie wat buite spitstye vir bv. 14 dae of 5 000 km&#x2014;daar is verskillende voor-waardes wat aan so &#x2019;n kaartjie gekoppel kan word&#x2014;geldig is. So &#x2019;n stelsel kan groot voordele inhou. Agb. lede weet almal hoe gewild die Eurorail-pas is vir mense wat Wes-Europa besoek. Ek meen dat iets van daardie aard veel kan bydra om die 12&#x0025; tot 12&#x00BD;&#x0025; van totale uitgawe, wat die buitelandse toeris tans op vervoer binnelands moet betaal, te verlaag na &#x2019;n meer aanvaarbare syfer van bv. in die omgewing van 5&#x0025; tot 7&#x0025;.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander moontlikheid wat die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister kan oorweeg, wanneer hulle met hul kollegas praat. Ons probeer tans ook om doelbewus, aan die hand van wat bv. in Israel en Griekeland gebeur, mense uit die buiteland te trek om kongresse hier in Suid-Afrika te hou. Daar is bv. op die oomblik &#x2019;n groot aantal mense op pad hiernatoe om die orgide&#x00EB;kongres by te woon. Soos agb. lede aan albei kante reeds ges&#x00EA; het, hou dit natuurlik nie net vervoerimplikasies in nie, maar ook implikasies ten opsigte van die bre&#x00EB; infrastruktuur wat nodig is om toeriste te akkommodeer. Dit is een van die voorwaardes wat ook noodsaaklik is, want vervoer alleen kan ongelukkig nie hierdie probleem om meer toeriste te trek, oplos nie, maar indien vervoerkoste verlaag kan word, kan daar &#x2019;n goeie begin gemaak word om wel daardie toeriste te trek.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, u sal verstaan dat wanneer &#x2019;n mens laaste in &#x2019;n debat opstaan, dit die moontlikhede relatief beperk om iets nuuts aan u te noem. Maar nou moet u asseblief net begrip h&#x00EA; daarvoor dat wat my kiesers betref hierdie beperking nie mag bestaan nie, en as ek derhalwe sekere dinge herhaal, moet u maar geduldig wees met my. &#x2019;n Ander aspek wat my hinder, is dat ek in sommige aspekte met die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine sal moet saamstem, maar ek hoop nie dat dit die waarde van my argumente heeltemal sal omvergooi nie!</p>

<p>Emerson het in 1860 reeds ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;The world is his who has the money to go over it.&#x201D; Met hierdie woorde het hy &#x2019;n kommersi&#x00EB;le waarheid vasgevat wat ons in Suid-Afrika myns insiens nie ten volle benut nie. Die inkomstesyfer ten opsigte van toerisme is reeds genoem. Vir die jaar 1980 was dit R476 miljoen. &#x2019;n Belangrike punt wat nie uitgekom het nie, is dat dit nie lugvervoerkoste insluit nie. &#x2019;n Ander aspek is dat dit bereken word dat die inkomste wat gegenereer word deur toerisme &#x2019;n vier faktor is. Met dit in ag genome, was die toeristebedryf derhalwe vir die jaar 1980 vir ons omstreeks R1,9 biljoen werd gewees. Dit is voorwaar &#x2019;n aansienlike bedrag, maar as &#x2019;n mens kyk na die bedrag wat toerisme in die w&#x00EA;reldhandel verteenwoordig, wat ook reeds genoem is&#x2014;en nou praat ons van slegs die direkte syfer, n1. R638 biljoen&#x2014;dan sien ons dat dit 6&#x0025; van die w&#x00EA;reldhandel uitmaak, en inderdaad die grootste enkele item daarvan is.</p>

<p>Daar is ook reeds daarop gewys dat die waarde van toerisme nie beperk is tot die ekonomiese voordeel daarvan nie, maar ook bydra tot &#x2019;n beter beeld van die land wat daardeur uitgedra kan word, wat veral vir ons in Suid-Afrika van groot belang is. Ek glo dat, met doelgerigte optrede, nadat daar behoorlike beplanning gedoen is, en die nodige fondse om dit deur te voer beskikbaar gestel is, ons in &#x2019;n baie groter mate ons deel van die w&#x00EA;reldtoerismehandel kan kry.</p>

<p>Die beplanning van &#x2019;n omvattende strategie waarin die Staat en die privaatsektor as vennote optree, is &#x2019;n voorvereiste vir die uitbreiding van ons toeristebedryf. Dr. Ferrario beklemtoon in die verslag na die Ekonomiese Potensiaal van die Wes-Kaapland, van die Buro vir Ekonomiese Navorsing van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch, waarna die agb. lid vir Vasco reeds vroe&#x00EB;r verwys het, dan ook hierdie besondere aspek, nl. dat daar globale beplanning moet wees, dat &#x2019;n raamwerk, waarbinne gewerk moet word, daargestel moet word. Dan wys hy ook, aan die hand van navorsingsresultate, &#x2019;n baie belangrike aspek uit wat &#x2019;n mens soms, omdat dit so vanselfsprekend is, heeltemal verbykyk. Dit is dat toerisme en wat vir toerisme gedoen word, dikwels verkeerdelik geskat word aan die omvang en die koste <span class="col_563-564" refersTo="page_0297"/>van die geriewe soos hotelakkommodasie, kommunikasiewe&#x00EB;, ens., wat geskep is, terv wyl die belangrikste faktor waarom die hele bedryf draai, nog steeds die besieningswaardighede is wat die land aanbied, die sogenaamde &#x201E;base attractions&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Opname het dan ook getoon dat 77&#x0025; van buitelandse toeriste wat Suid-Afrika gedurende die sewentigerjare besoek het, hulle keuse op Suid-Afrika uitgebring het as gevolg van die landskap, die natuurlike bates en die wild wat Suid-Afrika bied. Siegs by 9&#x0025; het hotelgeriewe, ens., &#x2019;n deurslaggewende rol gespeel. Die punt wat ek dus wil maak, is dat wat beklemtoon moet word in alle reklame wat ons aanbied, is Suid-Afrika die produk, en dat verblyf-en reisgeriewe, ens., slegs newefaktore is wat die bekombaarheid van die produk moontlik maak.</p>

<p>Ek glo ook dat die tyd reg is vir die daarstel van &#x2019;n oorkoepelende liggaam met uitvoerende magte om die pogings van alle instansies wat hierby betrokke is, soos die Departement, Satoer, die Spoorwee, plaaslike owerhede en private ondememings, te ko&#x00F6;rdineer. Die in die lewe roep van die verteenwoordigende komitee, na same-sprekings deur die Departement en Fedhasa, getuig hiervan, en moontlik kan hierdie komitee as afspringplek dien vir die daarstel van so &#x2019;n liggaam. Ek glo dat hierdie liggaam dan &#x2019;n omvattende maar &#x2019;n baie dringende ondersoek moet loods na die uitlig en evaluering van ons land se toeristeaantreklikhede, die groepering daarvan op streeksgrondslag en die beste wyse van, en teikengebiede vir, die bemarking daarvan. So &#x2019;n studie is bv. deur die Regering van kwaZulu gelas, en daar kan met groot vrug na die resultate daarvan gekyk word.</p>

<p>Oplossings vir die probleme wat reeds ten opsigte van die toeristebedryf uitgekristalliseer het, moet ook by hierdie ondersoek aandag kry. Ek sou graag in die tyd wat vir my oor is, by enkele van hierdie faktore wil stilstaan.</p>

<p>Ten eerste, en wat reeds ook al genoem is, bly die seisoensfaktor &#x2019;n oorheersende een, wat veral aan die huisvestigingsbedryf eise stel. So het in Desember 1980 84 390 buitelandse besoekers die land binnegekom, teenoor slegs 40 000 in Junie 1980. &#x2019;n Mens vind ook binnelands hierdie tendens. &#x2019;n Ondersoek het getoon dat meer as 50&#x0025; van binnelandse vakansiegangers hul vakansies gedurende die spitsperiodes wat met skoolen universiteitsvakansies saamval, neem. Dit bring teweeg dat gedurende die spitstye die huisvestingsektor nie die volle aanvraag na akkommodasie kan hanteer nie, terwyl in die af-seisoen die gemiddelde besetting van hierdie sektor maar ongeveer 40&#x0025; is. In die lig van die relatief lae gemiddelde besettingsyfer en die ho&#x00EB; oprigtingskoste, wat bv. vir &#x2019;n eenster-hotel op ongeveer R15 000 en vir &#x2019;n vyfster-hotel op ongeveer R75 000 per kamer geraam word, glo ek nie dat die oprig van nuwe hotelle hier die oplossing bied nie. Op 31 Desember 1980 was daar altesame 1 432 hotelle, wat 87 102 beddens voorsien het. Van hierdie hotelle was slegs 1,3&#x0025; vier-of vyfster-hotelle, terwyl die oorblywende 98,7&#x0025; drie-ster-of laer gegradeerde hotelle was. Die grootste besettingsdruk vind &#x2019;n mens dan ook in die vier-en vyfster-hotelle, en dit kan grotendeels opgelos word deur hierdie druk te kanaliseer na die laer gegradeerde hotelle. Uit die toeris se oogpunt is diens belangrik, en daar kan met vrug gekyk word na middele wat hierdie laer gegradeerde hotelle sal aanspoor en in staat sal stel om die diens wat die toeris eis, en geregtig op is, daar te stel. &#x2019;n Moontlikheid wat hier oorweeg kan word, is die verkorting van die afskryfperiode vir depresiasie van geboue en verbeteringe, wat tans op 15 jaar vir &#x2019;n vyfster-hotel, agtien jaar vir &#x2019;n drie-ster-hotel en 25 jaar vir &#x2019;n eenster-hotel staan. &#x2019;n Belangrike newevoordeel wat hieruit sal voortspruit is ook reeds genoem, en dit is dat dit Suid-Afrika ekonomies toeganklik sal maak vir &#x2019;n veel bre&#x00EB;r toeristeklas, wat nie altyd die akkommodasiekoste van die ho&#x00EB;r gegradeerde hotelle kan bybring nie.</p>

<p>Verder weet &#x2019;n mens ook dat die oorbesetting in groot mate tot gebiede beperk is, bv. tot Kaapstad, wat dan ook die tweede hooffaktor wat ons toeristebedryf kwel, uitlig, en waarby ek later sal stilstaan, nl. die oneweredige gebiedsverspreiding of gebiedsvoorkeure wat &#x2019;n mens by toeriste kry.</p>

<p>Alhoewel seisoensgebondenheid nooit heeltemal opgeklaar kan word nie, glo ek dat dit verlig kan word deur &#x2019;n gedagte wat ook hier uitgespreek is, nl. dat reklame wat veral in die buiteland aangebied word, die aantreklikhede van die Republiek ook buiteseisoen by die voornemende besoeker moet tuisbring. Ons klimaat-en seisoensverspreiding, <span class="col_565-566" refersTo="page_0298"/>in teenstelling met di&#x00E9; van baie ander lande, is dan inderdaad ook so dat dit hierdie &#x2019;n bereikbare mikpunt maak.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER VAN NYWERHEIDSWESE, HANDEL EN TOERISME</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die eerste instansie, baie hartlike dank aan al die agb. lede wat deelgeneem het aan hierdie debat. Ek wil hulle in besonder bedank vir die baie ho&#x00EB; peil waarop dit plaasgevind het en die positiewe manier waarop dit gedoen is en ook vir die identifisering van die baie probleme waarmee toerisme vandag te make het. Ek dink al die agb. lede, behalwe die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine wat hier en daar so &#x2019;n bietjie politiek probeer speel het, maar kom ons s&#x00EA; al die agb. lede, hy inkluis, het werklik begrip getoon vir die probleme wat toerisme op hierdie oomblik ondervind, soos byvoorbeeld die kwessie van spitstye, die kwessie van oneweredige verspreiding, vervoerprobleme, die koste van vervoer en die valleie en spitse in die verskillende gebiede. Dit is werklike probleme en is dan ook probleme wat ons aandag geniet. In die loop van my toespraak sal ek die filosofie uitspel wat ons ten opsigte van daardie probleme het. Dan sal ek ook na elke agb. lid se toespraak verwys om sekere sake wat hulle geopper het, uit te lig.</p>

<p>Voordat ek dit doen, wil ek net s&#x00EA; dat een van die agb. lede gister toe daar spesifiek oor die nywerheidswese gepraat is, verwys het na die probleme wat privaatmaatskappye ten opsigte van registrasie, werksgeleenthede en lisensi&#x00EB;ring het. Ek kan net noem dat die Staande Advieskomitee op Maatskappye reeds besig is om baie intensief na hierdie aangeleentheid te kyk. Die persoon wat daarmee besig is, is prof. Bosman van UNISA. Ons hoop om binne die volgende maande sy verslag beskikbaar te h&#x00EA; vir oorweging deur die Advieskomitee, met die oogmerk om privaatmaatskappye uit die Wet op Maatskappye te haal om dit vir hulle makliker te maak. Ek noem dit net sodat agb. lede kan weet dat hierdie soort aangeleentheid aandag kry. Ek doen dit ook omdat ek vir agb. lede wil aandui dat die agb. Minister en sy Departement probleme lank voor die tyd identifiseer. Wanneer agb. lede dit dan opper, is hulle gewoonlik reeds besig met die spitwerk en die aanvoorwerk ten opsigte van daardie besondere probleme.</p>

<p>Voor ek oor toerisme praat, mnr. die Voorsitter, sal u my vergun om aan di&#x00E9; agb. lede wat my en die agb. Minister gelukgewens het, baie dankie daarvoor te s&#x00EA;. Ons het groot waardering daarvoor. Terselfdertyd wil ek ook tog s&#x00EA; dat ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad, en ek glo ook ek praat namens die Opposisiepartye, baie jammer is dat mnr. Behrens ons Toerisme-afdeling moes verlaat. Ons wens hom alles van die beste toe daar waar hy nou is. Ek dink egter ons het hier maar weer die spreekwoordelike posisie van &#x201E;the King is dead, long live the King&#x201D;. Ons het &#x2019;n nuwe koning, mnr. Frans Scheepers, en ons wil hom baie gelukwens met sy aanstelling en ons wil hoop dat hy in die mooi voetspore van sy voorganger sal loop saam met al sy manne, soos byvoorbeeld mnr. Reitz, en al die ander amptenare wat ek alreeds ontmoet het en wat ek weet snags werk en naweke opoffer om toerisme nie net in Suid-Afrika nie maar ook in die buiteland te bevorder. Ek dink ons moet &#x2019;n baie hartlike woord van dank aan hulle rig en vir hulle s&#x00EA; dat wat hulle doen nie ongemerk by ons verbygaan nie, want ons weet dat hulle met &#x2019;n baie belangrike taak besig is.</p>

<p>Die stelling is hier gemaak&#x2014;en dit is waar&#x2014;dat toerisme vandag beslis een van die grootste bedrywe in die w&#x00EA;reld is. Ons hoop dan ook dat dit een van die grootste bedrywe in Suid-Afrika sal word. Ek dink dat as ons planne reg loop en alles wat ons beoog mooi saamspeel, dit moontlik is dat ons dit sal regkry.</p>

<p>Net ter inleiding wil ek s&#x00EA; dat dit interessant is om net te kyk waar toerisme sy oorsprong het. Ons glo dat toerisme sy oorsprong in handelsreise het. Die kameelkaravane van ouds waarmee speserye ens vervoer is, het sekere handelsroetes oopgetrap. Sekere aristokrate van die vroe&#x00EB;r jare het dan weer hierdie roetes gevolg vir die avontuur wat dit hulle gebied het. Avontuur was dus die tweede stap. Uit hierdie avontuur het verdere ontdekkingsreise gevolg. Toe het die digters en skrywers van daardie vroe&#x00EB;r jare &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol gespeel deurdat hulle die romantiek van hierdie ontdekkingsreise en die avontuur daaraan verbonde beskrywe het. Ek dink dit is uit hierdie romantiek wat aan sulke reise kleef dat die romantiek van toerisme gebore is. Die <span class="col_567-568" refersTo="page_0299"/>toerisme wat ons vandag het, is uit daardie agtergrond gebore. Daar is nou by herhaling die stelling gemaak dat toerisme baie wyer strek as net die toerisme self. Dit is waar. Ek dink toerisme binnelands en buitelands dek omtrent die hele handelspektrum. Die toeristebedryf affekteer ons nywerhede omdat dit vervaardigingsaktiwiteite stimuleer. Dit stimuleer ons handel. Daar is alreeds genoem dat buitelandse toeriste in Suid-Afrika in 1980 meer as R920 miljoen in ons handel bestee het. As ons buitelandse en binnelandse toeriste in Suid-Afrika saamtel, kom die totale besteding deur toeriste in Suid-Afrika op R1&#x00BD; biljoen per jaar te staan. Toerisme dek dus &#x2019;n wye veld in Suid-Afrika. Dit gaan ook baie verder. Dit het ook &#x2019;n politieke inslag, want mense wat toer, is geneig om ambassadeurs te word. Mense wat deur toerisme ambassadeurs vir Suid-Afrika word, doen vir Suid-Afrika baie goed in die buiteland. Hulle skep vir Suid-Afrika goeie verhoudinge in die buiteland. Hulle skep vir Suid-Afrika goeie intervolkere-verhoudinge. Ek het self so &#x2019;n bietjie ondervinding daarvan dat mense wat een of twee keer na Suid-Afrika gekom het en aanvanklik niks goed van Suid-Afrika wil weet nie, nadat hulle twee of drie keer in Suid-Afrika was, begrip vir ons probleme gekry het. Ek wil nie daarmee s&#x00EA; dat hulle ons beleid aanvaar nie. Ons vra dit nie van hulle nie. Hulle het egter wel begrip vir ons probleme in Suid-Afrika gekry. Dit is vir ons belangrik. Dit maak van daardie mense goeie toeriste en goeie ambassadeurs.</p>

<p>Net om vir agb. lede &#x2019;n aanduiding te gee van wat ons benadering ten opsigte van toerisme is, wil ek kortliks die volgende noem. Die tak Toerisme in hierdie Departement beskik oor 11 nasionale toeristeburo&#x2019;s. Ek wil net kortliks die sewe of agt punte noem waarna daardie nasionale toeristeburo&#x2019;s kyk en wat hulle gedurig in heroorweging neem en evalueer. Dit sal die meeste van die punte wat deur agb. lede gemaak is, ondervang. Die eerste is om toerisme na en in Suid-Afrika te ko&#x00F6;rdineer en te bevorder. Verskeie agb. lede het dit genoem dat ons toerisme na Suid-Afrika moet bevorder, dat ons toerisme in Suid-Afrika moet ko&#x00F6;rdineer om die spitse en die valleie te probeer uitskakel sodat toerisme meer eweredig in Suid-Afrika versprei kan word. Die tweede een is om die uitbreiding van bestaande toeristegeriewe aan te moedig. Ek dink die punt is ook hier ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer dat ons vervoerprobleme het en dat ons akkommodasieprobleme het. Dit is een van die oogmerke van die tak Toerisme om juis die uitbreiding van hierdie geriewe aan te moedig. Die derde een is om deur middel van &#x2019;n deurlopende opname leiding en inligting aangaande die aard, die gehalte, die omvang en die ontwikkeling van huisvesting en toeristegeriewe te verskaf. Ek dink dis &#x2019;n punt wat deur &#x2019;n aantal lede gemaak is dat ons ook &#x2019;n diens moet lewer, dat ons tevrede toeriste in Suid-Afrika moet kry. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek dank die agb. lid vir Wynberg vir die voorreg.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, daar word probeer om gedurig die gehalte, die diensleweringsgehalte, die geriewegehalte, onder die aandag van ons tak Toerisme te bring sodat ons die nodige stappe kan doen om &#x2019;n beter diens aan die toeriste in Suid-Afrika te lewer. Die vierde een is die opleiding van toergidse. Dit is belangrik dat die toergidse wat ons toergroepe in Suid-Afrika lei, goed opgelei moet wees. Hulle moet weet wat hulle verkoop en hoe dit verkoop moet word. Dit is van kardinale belang. Dit is natuurlik ook streeksgebonde. &#x2019;n Toergids wat goeie kennis van die Wes-Kaap het, het nie noodwendig goeie kennis van die Noord-wes-Kaap nie. Dit is twee verskillende pakkette wat verkoop moet word. Die vyfde een is die versameling van toeriste-inligting, geskiedkundig, geografies en kultureel. Wat is di&#x00E9; dinge wat ons aan ons toeriste wil bied? Die agb. lid vir Oos-Londen-Stad het daarna verwys dat ons die inligting bymekaar moet maak en dan daardie inligting aan die mense moet verkoop. Dit kom dus neer op die <span class="col_569-570" refersTo="page_0300"/>bemarking van toerisme. Dit is een van ons take om toerisme in Suid-Afrika te bemark.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister a question? The hon. the Deputy Minister has just said that we must market our various areas. Can I ask him whether the Department has changed its policy which it had a year or two ago of marketing regions and in fact in that marketing of regions they left the Border area, the East London coast, totally out of the situation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am coming to that. I will deal with that point in full. What the hon. member has just said, is partly true, but it is not so that that region has been forgotten altogether.</p>

<p>Die sewende punt wat ek wil noem, is dat daar spesialistoeristeattraksie-areas uitgekies moet word. Laat my &#x2019;n paar voorbeelde noem. Ons het hier in gedagte areas soos byvoorbeeld die Augrabies-waterval, die Wes-Kaap met sy wynroete wat &#x2019;n unieke roete is. Ons sal nie van die Worcester-roete praat nie. Dan is daar ook die ko&#x00F6;rdinasie van die werksaamhede van alle organisasies in Suid-Afrika wat met toerisme te make het.</p>

<p>Nou kom ek by die punt wat die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Sentraal so pas gemaak het. Ons het etlike jare gelede besluit dat Suid-Afrika as &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reld-in-een verkoop moet word. Ek het onlangs &#x2019;n film gesien wat dit werklik probeer doen. Ek was so be&#x00EF;ndruk deur daardie film dat ek voel dat ons moet re&#x00EB;l dat elke Parlementslid wat in toerisme belangstel daardie film kan sien. Dit is een van die mees uitstaande films oor Suid-Afrika wat ek nog ooit gesien het en ek het &#x2019;n hele paar gesien. As daardie film Suid-Afrika as toeristeland nie kan verkoop nie, sal geen film in die w&#x00EA;reld Suid-Afrika as toeristeland kan verkoop nie. Ons het egter gevoel dat dit nie voldoende is nie. Toe het die Pip-aksie gekom. Dit staan vir &#x201E;produk binne produk&#x201D;. Om di&#x00E9; Pip-aksie in Suid-Afrika van stapel te laat loop, het ons Suid-Afrika in drie sones verdeel, naamlik die Bosveld-Transvaal-sone, die Natalontspan-ningsland en die Kaapse Kus-strook.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malcomess">

<p>Is dit nou Kaapstad tot Port Elizabeth?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#adjunk-minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, Kaapstad tot Port Elizabeth. Ek het met hierdie aspek by die Port Alfred-kongres van nou die aand gehandel. Wanneer ek nou s&#x00EA; dat die Pip-aksie net op hierdie drie besondere gebiede konsentreer, wil ek vir geen oomblik impliseer dat die res van Suid-Afrika totaal vergete is nie. Die res van Suid-Afrika word nog altyd deur die besondere toeristeburo&#x2019;s op die gewone manier, op die gewone bemarkingspatroon, hanteer.</p>

<p>Waar ek nou na die Pip-aksie verwys, wil ek ook net noem dat ons alreeds besluit het dat dit nie ver genoeg gaan nie omdat dit nie prakties moontlik is om die toeristefasiliteite en-moontlikhede van Kaapstad tot Port Elizabeth in een paket te verkoop nie. Daar word reeds aan hierdie aspek gewerk. In di&#x00E9; verband wil ek noem dat die plaaslike Nasionale Toeristeburo van my Departement tans besig is om in oorleg en in same-werking met die bedryf &#x2019;n volledige bemarkingsprogram&#x2014;dit is ook hier genoem &#x2014;op te stel vir die hele kusgebied vanaf Kaapstad tot by Port Elizabeth, insluitend die aangrensende binneland, effens uitgebrei, weer in kleiner seksies op te sny sodat ons &#x2019;n meer gedetailleerde verkoopaksie in di&#x00E9; verband kan h&#x00EA;, juis in &#x2019;n poging om die valleiperiodes op te vul, d&#x00ED;t waarna so baie van die agb. lede verwys het. Ek wil dus graag &#x2019;n beroep op die privaatsektor doen om hierdie program te ondersteun.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek graag by &#x2019;n punt aansluit wat by herhaling hier genoem is en dit is dat daar meer oorhoofs na toerisme gekyk moet word. Dit is ook by herhaling genoem dat dit nie net die tak Toerisme en die toeristeburo&#x2019;s is wat vir die uitbouing van toerisme verantwoordelik is nie, maar dat ook die privaatsektor op &#x2019;n baie groter skaal by toerisme betrek moet word. In hierdie verband wil ek net s&#x00EA; wat eintlik ons oogmerke met hierdie groter intensifisering van die Pipaksie is. Dit gaan basies daaroor om goeie huisvesting en dan ook &#x2019;n voldoende verskeidenheid in daardie besondere gebiede beskikbaar te stel. Tweedens wil ons &#x2019;n goeie padstelsel en &#x2019;n verskeidenheid vervoermoontlikhede na die verskillende gebiede beskikbaar maak. Die kwessie van vervoermoontlikhede na die verskillende toeristegebiede is dan ook deur agb. lede genoem. Derdens s&#x00EA; ons dat die geriewe sover as moontlik ingeskakel moet wees by internasionale <span class="col_571-572" refersTo="page_0301"/>vlugte. Dit is &#x2019;n punt wat die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine baie goed gemaak het. Ek persoonlik voel dat daardie punt heelwat meriete het. Hoekom moet al die buitelandse toeriste net na een lughawe in Suid-Afrika kom, siende dat Suid-Afrika so uitgestrek is en juis &#x2019;n vervoerprobleem met toeriste in die spitstye ondervind.</p>

<p>Sekere klimaatsomstandighede moet in ag geneem word en moet in die totale program gebruik word. Wanneer ons praat van &#x2019;n totale program, is dit ons oogmerk om nie net &#x2019;n toeristeprogram beskikbaar te h&#x00EA; nie, maar &#x2019;n toeristeprogram beskikbaar te h&#x00EA; wat bemarkbaar is. Dit help nie om &#x2019;n toeristeprogram te h&#x00EA; en daardie toeristeprogram is nie bemarkbaar nie. Dan het ons ons poging gemors.</p>

<p>Die laaste punt wat ek wil noem, is dat daar &#x2019;n toeristestrategie vir elke gebied uitgewerk moet word wat dan deel van die totale program sal wees. Die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine asook &#x2019;n hele paar van die ander agb. lede het ook na so &#x2019;n totale toeristestrategie verwys.</p>

<p>Agb. lede het ook verwys na die komitee waarna die agb. Minister in sy toespraak in Athene verwys het. Ons moet egter so &#x2019;n bietjie stadig met die komitee. Dit is nie dat ons dit nie wil h&#x00EA; nie. Inteendeel, ons dink dit is belangrik dat so &#x2019;n komitee uiteindelik daargestel sal word, maar nadat die Kommissie vir Administrasie, wat nou besig is met &#x2019;n totale ondersoek na die rasionalisering van toerisme in Suid-Afrika, sy verslag uitgebring het. Dit is baie duidelik dat die toerisme oor &#x2019;n baie wye veld verspreid l&#x00EA; en dat daar gevolglik &#x2019;n aansienlike aantal belangegroepe is wat daarmee gemoeid is. Ons is bewus daarvan dat daar op verskeie terreine probleme bestaan. Daar sal daadwerklik vir die toekoms beplan moet word ten einde die eise wat aan ons gestel sal word, die hoof te kan bied. Dit is vir my van intense belang dat alle groepe, individue en belange wat by die saak betrokke is, deel moet h&#x00EA; aan &#x2019;n geko&#x00F6;rdineerde en planmatige ontwikkeling vir die toekoms sodat ons almal saam kan beplan hoe om bestaande probleme uit te skakel. In hierdie omstandighede dink ek dat dit &#x2019;n goeie gedagte sal wees om oorweging daaraan te skenk om &#x2019;n konferensie te re&#x00EB;l waarby alle belangegroepe betrek kan word en waar gedagtes gewissel kan word oor die probleme wat ondervind word en om toekomstige optrede te probeer identifiseer en formuleer.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek bedank die agb. lid vir Wynberg vir die geleentheid wat hy my bied.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is van voornemens om die gedagte binnekort verder met die agb. Minister en die Departement te bespreek. Ons hoop dat hierdie komitee waarna die agb. Minister verwys het, hieruit tot stand sal kom, as dit nie vroe&#x00EB;r tot stand kom nie. Ons hoop ook dat daar uit hierdie hele poging &#x2019;n toeristestrategie, &#x2019;n toeristeprogram, vir Suid-Afrika tot stand sal kan kom.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander punt wat ek graag vandag net as &#x2019;n stimulerende gedagte wil noem. Ek het dit reeds met die Departement bespreek. Ek voel dat ons miskien deur die komitee wat ons in gedagte het &#x2019;n ondersoek moet laat instel na wat die moontlikheid daarvan is om die verskillende attraksies of gebiede in Suid-Afrika te gradeer. Met ander woorde, kom ons gebruik maar die ou bekende stelsel van &#x2019;n vyfster-toeristeattraksie, &#x2019;n vierster-toeriste-attraksie, &#x2019;n driester-toeriste-attraksie, &#x2019;n tweester-toeriste-attraksie en &#x2019;n eenster-toeriste-attraksie. Ons weet daar is baie probleme aan so &#x2019;n stelsel verbonde. Ons weet dit is baie moeilik om te besluit wanneer &#x2019;n toeriste-attraksie &#x2019;n vyfster-toeriste-attraksie is en wanneer dit &#x2019;n vierster-toeriste-attraksie is. Maar ons het die voorbeeld van die Michelingidse in Europa, waarin alle toeriste-plekke gekarteer is en &#x2019;n vyfster-, vierster-of driestertoekenning kry. Ek het baie van daardie plekke besoek en ek moet s&#x00EA; dat daardie gradering werklik goed is. Dit is werklik korrek. Ek dink nie ons moet in Suid-Afrika daardie stelsel slaafs navolg nie. Ons moet miskien s&#x00EA; in ons land is dit &#x2019;n goue attraksie, &#x2019;n silwer attraksie en &#x2019;n brons attraksie, sodat daar &#x2019;n bietjie verskeidenheid ingebou kan word.</p>

<p>Dit is moontlik, maar ek weet nie of hulle Suid-Afrika ken nie. Ek dink ons eie mense ken Suid-Afrika beter.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou graag spesifiek verwys na &#x2019;n aantal punte wat agb. lede geopper het. Vir die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine wil ek s&#x00EA; dat dit heeltemal waar is dat die toeristebedryf in die w&#x00EA;reld oor &#x2019;n bepaalde termyn, naamlik die sestigertot die sewentigerjare, met gemiddeld 7&#x0025; gegroei het, terwyl dit in Suid-Afrika gedurende daardie selfde termyn met 11&#x0025; tot 20&#x0025; gegroei het. Suid-Afrika se toeristebedryf is werklik besig om te groei. Die agb. lid het gevra of ons nog in &#x2019;n mededingende posisie is.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ons s&#x00EA; globaal gesien. Ek wil nie s&#x00EA; dat ons ten opsigte van sekere lande nie &#x2019;n agterstand het nie, maar die tak Toerisme se benadering is dat ons ons bemarkingstrategie gedurig aanpas, dat ons dit gedurig evalueer ten opsigte van ons eie posisie <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> die posisie van ander lande. In di&#x00E9; geval bly ons ondanks al die probleme waarna daar verwys is en wat toerisme na Suid-Afrika moeilik maak, in elk geval effektief.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook &#x2019;n paar ander punte genoem, maar die een wat ek graag wil uitlig, is dat wanneer ons toeriste na die mooi gebiede in Suid-Afrika bring, ons moet waak dat ons omgewing nie in di&#x00E9; proses tot niet gaan nie. Verskeie ander agb. lede het ook die punt genoem. Daar word gevoel dat ons ons omgewing moet bou en bewaar. Ek dink die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine het dit baie goed uitgewys dat 77&#x0025; van die mense wat na Suid-Afrika kom, kom omdat Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n besondere omgewing bied. As ons dus ons omgewing vernietig, vernietig ons ons toerismepotensiaal in Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>Ons het met Fedhasa etlike samesprekings oor akkommodasie gevoer. Ons het gister weer samesprekings gehad om te kyk wat ons ten opsigte van akkommodasie kan doen.</p>

<p>Ons sal soveel geld vir toerisme by die agb. Minister van Finansies probeer kry as wat die Skatkis kan bekostig. Ek het nog nie vanjaar aan daardie gesprek deelgeneem nie, maar ek sal volgende jaar seker aan daardie gesprek deelneem en ek kan agb. lede verseker dat ek soveel as moontlik sal probeer kry om toerisme in Suid-Afrika mee te bevorder.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Kempton Park het op &#x2019;n baie duidelike en deeglike wyse die probleme uitgelig waarna ek reeds verwys het. Hy het ook daarop gewys dat ons omgewing bewaar moet word. Hy het ook verwys na die feit dat toeriste goeie ambassadeurs is. Hy het voorts verwys na die uitbreiding van fasiliteite. Daarop het ek reeds gereageer. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die instelling van hierdie komitee waarna verwys is, oorweeg moet word. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, so &#x2019;n komitee sal wel ingestel word, maar op hierdie oomblik is die tyd daarvoor nog nie ryp nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. lid vir Ladybrand baie hartlik bedank vir die hulde wat hy gebring het aan die groot werk wat Satoer doen. Satoer se werk is werklik omvangryk, Satoer se werk is effektief, en Satoer se werk moet net van hierdie Komitee die grootste lof kry. Ek dink dit sal goed wees as die Departement aan Satoer en sy mense oordra dat hierdie Komitee met waardering kennis neem van die groot taak wat Satoer in die buiteland doen om toerisme na Suid-Afrika te bevorder.</p>

<p>Dan het die agb. lid dr. Welgemoed &#x2019;n baie interessante toespraak gehou waarin hy na twee aspekte van toerisme verwys het. Hy het verwys na die koste van vervoer, wat &#x2019;n wesenlike probleem is. Dan het hy ook verwys na sekere alternatiewe metodes om die koste van toerisme in Suid-Afrika makliker te maak. Ten opsigte van die Eurorailpas wat hy genoem het, wil ek net vir hom s&#x00EA; dat die Departement reeds met die Departement van Spoorwee in aanraking is oor di&#x00E9; aangeleentheid. Onderhandelings is reeds aan die gang om vir toeriste so &#x2019;n pas beskikbaar te maak waarmee in lae spitstye gereis kan word. Ons het nog nie &#x2019;n antwoord van hulle gekry nie, maar hoop om eersdaags &#x2019;n antwoord van hulle te kry.</p>

<p>Wat die koste van brandstof betref, kan ek ook net aan die agb. noem dat daar alreeds &#x2019;n groot toegewing gemaak is. Die 6,75 sent per liter wat vir die Egalisasiefonds bedoel is, word nie deur die buitelandse rederye betaal nie. Ons het dus van die Departement en van die Regering se kant reeds &#x2019;n baie groot toegewing gemaak om die ho&#x00EB; <span class="col_575-576" refersTo="page_0303"/>brandstofkoste so laag as moontlik te probeer hou.</p>

<p>Ek het alreeds verwys na sommige van die punte wat die agb. lid vir Oos-Londen-Stad genoem het. Miskien kan ek net vir hom &#x2019;n paar syfers ten opsigte van hotelle in Suid-Afrika noem, aangesien die agb. lid &#x2019;n baie belangrike punt ten opsigte van die besetting van hotelle gemaak het, veral wat betref die besetting van die verskillende grade hotelle. Vyf-en-tagtig persent van alle toeriste wat na Suid-Afrika kom, bly in hotelle. Die verdeling is min of meer soos volg: Eensterhotelle dra 8&#x0025; van daardie toeriste; tweesterhotelle dra 15&#x0025; van daardie toeriste; driesterhotelle dra 26&#x0025; van daardie toeriste; viersterhotelle dra 18&#x0025; van daardie toeriste; en vyfsterhotelle dra 31&#x0025; van daardie toeriste. Die interessante van hierdie statistiek is dat tweesterhotelle en viersterhotelle besig is om met mekaar te wedywer oor die posisie van wie die meeste toeriste huisves. Dit is baie interessante statistiek wat miskien meer aandag sal geniet. Die agb. lid het, as ek my reg herinner, vir ons daarop gewys dat 77&#x0025; van die toeriste kom om ons omgewing te geniet. Daarop het ek reeds gereageer.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag afsluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat ek dink ons toeristebedryf in die toekoms op drie gedragskodes of slagspreuke, of wat &#x2019;n mens dit ook al wil noem, gebaseer sal wees. Die eerste wat ons sal moet doen, is dat ons in ons reklame die romantiek van Suid-Afrika as &#x2019;n toeristeland sover as moontlik sal moet uitbou. Tweedens, ons sal vandag moet begin bou om die toeriste van more te kan trek. Ons moet nie m&#x00F4;re vir die toeriste van more begin bou nie; ons moet vandag begin bou. Derdens, ons hoef nie onmiddellik miljoene rande te bestee om toerisme te bevorder nie. Ek wil die stelling maak dat met die kleiner pogings wat vandag in toerisme aangewend word, ons die krag van die toerisme van m&#x00F4;re sal bou.</p>
