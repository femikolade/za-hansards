<speech by="#swart">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to claim the privilege of the half-hour, although, unfortunately, I shall not be able to use it all.</p>

<p>There are a number of matters of detail I want to raise during the short time at my disposal, but I want first to deal in general terms with the very important aspect of the function of the Police Force in the South African society. I believe that in the light of the special circumstances which pertain in South Africa, where there are growing friction and increasing threats to our security, I believe in these circumstances the status of the Police Force within our society is of vital significance.</p>

<p>As far as I see it, there are two great needs in this regard. Firstly the need to have a contented Police Force&#x2014;contented in regard to salaries and service conditions generally. Secondly there is the need for the Police Force to be respected&#x2014;not feared&#x2014; by the public at large as law enforcement officers who can be relied upon for their objectivity and impartiality, and can therefore depend upon the general sympathy and goodwill of the public which they serve in any situation. These are, I think, the two great needs.</p>

<p>To deal with the last need first; I have said before, and I will say again this afternoon, that because of the unjust laws which they are so often called upon to enforce, I believe that the lot of the South African policeman is perhaps the most unenviable in the world. We know that they are all too often forced into situations which cannot be related to the normally accepted sphere of duties of policemen in combating normal crime and preserving normal law and order. We know that they are all too frequently made the tools of their political bosses in order to enforce unpopular laws which are bitterly resented by the people affected&#x2014;people, incidentally, who have had no part in the making of those laws. For example, I do not believe that the ordinary policeman enjoyed doing what he was told to do in Nyanga. I do not believe that the ordinary policeman enjoyed pulling down shelters, removing plastic covers from women and children and confiscating blankets and that sort of thing. That is not what he joined the Force to do. I do not believe either that the ordinary policeman enjoys enforcing the pass laws and influx control, or the Group Areas Act, or spying on couples suspected of contravening the Immorality Act or the prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. I do not believe that the ordinary policeman really expected that these were the functions that he should be asked to perform.</p>

<p>Yet these are some of the things they are required to do, and in the process they bear the brunt of the resentment and hostility of the people concerned, who so often see them as symbols of oppression and not as symbols of just law and proper order. I return to my original theme, Sir. None of these things does anything positive for their status in the society which they serve, and as a consequence they incur the wrath rather than the goodwill of that society. The fault for this lies with their political bosses, not with the ordinary policeman, I have great sympathy for the ordinary policeman. But the tasks they are asked to perform and the laws which they are asked to enforce are a result of the activities and the views of their political bosses. That is the first point I wanted to make in regard to the status of the Police Force in our society.</p>

<p>The second point relates to their conditions of service which are woefully inadequate and inappropriate, and this is also the fault of their political bosses. It is not just a question of what they are paid, which I will deal with shortly. It is a question of the attitude of the hon. the Minister and the Government towards them. Why does the Minister treat these policemen like children? Why does the hon. the Minister deny them the right to think and speak for themselves?</p>

<from><span class="col_579-580" refersTo="page_0309"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>You&#x2019;ll soon find out if you listen. Why is the Minister so supersensitive about any policeman airing his grievances and seeking redress of them, and why is he afraid of any sort of Press scrutiny over police conditions and normal police matters? I believe it is the right of a policeman as a citizen of South Africa and as a Public Servant to be able to air his grievances and plead for improvement of his service conditions without fear of discrimination and victimization.</p>

<p>Equally I believe it is the right of the public who rely on the Police Force for their protection, to have knowledge of the conditions of service of the Force and, in fact, if the veil of secrecy which exists in this regard at the present time were lifted, and reasonable public relations were adopted and established, this would result in far greater sympathy for members of the Force from the public than exists at the present time.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that at the moment there is no representative body capable of handling wage disputes and complaints about working conditions within the Force. Unlike other departments of the Public Service, there is no staff association and the only way a policeman can express his dissatisfaction over conditions is to contact his commanding officer, who then passes the complaint on to a senior officer. Arid if a disgruntled or dissatisfied policeman dares to take any other course, he is threatened with severe disciplinary action and the department will go to all sorts of lengths to identify the sources of any complaints from within the Force to outside agencies, as witness the recent threat to a journalist of <i>The Cape Times</i> who had written about reports made to him by policemen about their service conditions&#x2014;he was threatened with action to disclose his sources of information. Fortunately better judgment obtained in the end, and no such action was taken. This is a matter which again reflects the super sensitivity of the Minister in this regard. I am not the only one who raises this issue of police conditions, service conditions, and the fact that policemen should not be denied the right to express views on these conditions. I can quote from comment in <i>The Citizen,</i> not a newspaper that supports my party, of the 9th July, from a leading article headed &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t lock up the police&#x201D;. It goes on and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There&#x2019;s nothing more disturbing than the police attitude&#x2014;or perhaps we should say the Minister of Police&#x2019;s attitude&#x2014;to the disclosure of pay and service conditions in the force. The Minister, Mr. Le Grange, seems to think that by disclosing these details, newspapers encourage policemen to quit the force.</block>

<p>It then goes on in similar vein. There are other newspapers, including <i>Rapport,</i> who said that the Minister should not be so sensitive on this issue. The fact of the matter is that if one looks at police salaries and service conditions, I believe that the Minister&#x2019;s handling thereof has been no less than appalling. I think it has been an appalling situation. In the light of mass resignations from the Force, 2 000 last year, 400 in the first few months of this year, and mounting public dismay over the situation, the hon. the Minister has shown no real appreciation of the extent of the probleem. There were the limited financial improvements of last year, followed by a further minimal increase in the mini-budget earlier this year, followed by a confused further increase in the few weeks before the general election, followed again by the increase announced at the beginning of July. All of this showed an inconsistency and a confusion in regard to the whole issue of police conditions and salaries. In this regard it is interesting to note that the recent pay increases came at a time when the official police magazine, <i>Servamus,</i> disclosed that the increases initially announced by the Minister at a meeting of the Pretoria Press Club in June were merely rectification of an error made by the &#x201C;financial sector&#x201D;. What was meant by that? Perhaps the hon. the Minister can explain. According to the magazine, although the hon. the Minister announced that the increase would be a substantial one, the amount was only to be &#x201C;correction of a fault&#x201D;, whatever that may mean. If this does not indicate confusion and negligence, what does?</p>

<p>Looking now at the new salary scales; while they certainly do constitute an improvement, in some cases up to several notches on the previous salary scale, there is still a very strange and unrealistic imbalance between the treatment of the lower ranks of the Police Force and that of the higher ranks. In the interests of recruitment to the <span class="col_581-582" refersTo="page_0310"/>Force&#x2014;and this is a matter to which the hon. the Minister must surely be giving his attention&#x2014;in the light of resignations and shortages, one would have thought that far more realistic salaries would be offered to recruits to the lower ranks than are offered in terms of the present salary scales; salary scales which provided for example, according to the information I have at my disposal, that a constable will commence at a salary of R2 718 per annum, with annual increments of R216 at the lowest end of the scale. In terms of the old scale, the figure for a constable at the lowest rank was R2 450 per annum with annual increments of R195. A sergeant now starts at R4 470 with annual increments of R240, as opposed to the previous scale where he started with R3 975, and moved up to R4 170 with annual increments of R225 per annum.</p>

<p>My information, as far as I know, is from the Department of State Administration and is up-to-date. If I am wrong, the hon. the Minister must tell me. I am subject to the same conditions as the public; that the hon. the Minister does not make public the salary scales.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister is taking up my time, but I will certainly do so. A sergeant now starts at R4 470 with annual increments of R240, in terms of the information I have.</p>

<p>Your figures are wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#swart">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. A. F. SWART</person>:</from>

<p>All right, but then the hon. the Minister must enlighten me. It is interesting, nontheless, to compare these figures with some categories of other staff under the control of the State Administration Commission. For example, the lowest paid categories of clerical staff for Whites are those of copy compositor and typist, in which case the salary is a commencing salary of R3 366 with annual increments of R216. A pupil photographer gets a salary of R2 934 with annual increments of R216. If the hon. the Minister has more updated figures, I will be happy to hear them. The recent increases do not encourage the belief that they are going to have a dramatic affect upon recruitment of policemen into the Police Force. I am thinking particularly of the starting salaries.</p>

<p>Other matters which I would like to deal with in the very limited time at my disposal are the question of the new agreement which has been negotiated between the S.A. Police and the Newspaper Press Union and which was apprently signed last month. I would like the hon. the Minister to give us some information in regard to this agreement. The final point I want to make quickly is the question of police training. We are now told that Black recruits have had their training cut from 23 weeks to 11 weeks because of the shortage of accommodation at Hammanskraal Training College. The training period for Whites on the other hand remains at six months or 26 weeks. I want to know from the hon. the Minister why he thinks it possible to train a Black recruit in 11 weeks whereas 26 weeks are allowed to train a White recruit? It seems a very strange situation. I would like the hon. the Minister to deal with these matters; unfortunately my time has now expired, but these are matters I want answers for, from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. J. VLOK</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is verbasend dat die agb. lid vir Berea vanmiddag hier kom en vir ons vertel dat ons die beeld van die polisie moet verbeter. Ek kan my baie goed herinner, in die tyd wat ek in die agb. Raad is, hoe bv. die agb. lid vir Houghton op die voorpunt was met die aftakeling van die beeld van ons polisie-&#x2014;tot in die afgrond het sy hulle afgetakel! Waar is die dae toe sy vir ons van die more tot die aand vertel het van sogenaamde &#x201E;police brutality&#x201D;. Nou het die agb. lid dit vergeet. Vandag s&#x00EA; die agb. lid vir Berea ewe hoogheilig vir ons, ons takel die beeld van die Mag af! Kan jy nou meer! Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad het oor die jare baie hard gewerk aan die uitbouing van die beeld van die Polisiemag in Suid-Afrika&#x2014;nie die Opposisie nie!</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Musgrave s&#x00EA; verder vanmiddag vir ons dat die salarisse van die polisie <span class="col_583-584" refersTo="page_0311"/>nie reg is nie en dat die agb. Minister en die Regering nie daarna kyk nie. Die agb. Minister sal hom volledig antwoord, maar ek wil dit vir hom s&#x00EA;, dit is vir my baie duidelik dat hy oor &#x2019;n saak praat waar hy geen kennis van het nie. Hy weet nie wat aangaan nie, daarom kom haal hy hier syfers aan wat heeltemal verkeerd is. Dus is sy gevolgtrekkings, soos gewoonlik ook heeltemal verkeerd. Ek wil van die agb. lid weet of hy of enige van die ander lede van die PFP die agb. Minister gevra het wat die huidige salarisse van die polisie is. Die antwoord is &#x201E;nee&#x201D;, hulle het nie eens die moeite gedoen om te vra nie. Dan kom hy vandag hier en val die agb. Minister aan oor die salarisse van ons polisie. Ons s&#x00EA; ook die polisie moet baie goeie salarisse kry en u sal aanstons, as die agb. Minister antwoord, hoor wat ons gedoen het om goeie salarisse en goeie diensvoorwaardes vir ons polisie daar te stel.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid maak ook die aanmerking hier dat die polisie &#x201E;are the tools of their political bosses&#x201D;. Ons verwerp dit met die minagting wat dit verdien, want dit is nou sommer regtig snert.</p>

<p>Ek wil egter op &#x2019;n ander terrein meer positief oor ons polisie praat. Dit is &#x2019;n feit dat reg van die begin van die geskiedenis van ons samelewing af, dit deur geweld ontsier word. Dit was deur die eeue so. Die verskynsel van geweld het in die afgelope jare so toegeneem dat gesaghebbendes dwarsoor die w&#x00EA;reld, ons tyd met reg bestempel as &#x201E;an age of violence&#x201D;. Ons leef in &#x2019;n tyd en &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reld wat deurdrenk is van terreur wat, van links en van regs van die gebalanseerde spektrum, aan die orde van die dag is. Die doelwit van hierdie saaiers van geweld, die bloeddorstige verwoesters van onskuldige menselewens, is Suid-Afrika&#x2014;wat vandag die onbenydenswaardige posisie van &#x201E;eerste&#x201D; op hulle prioriteitslys beklee. Ons staan in die brandpunt van &#x2019;n georkestreerde aanslag om die bestaande orde in Suid-Afrika te vernietig. Dit is die verklaarde doelwit van ons vyande. In die proses sal ons bestaande Christelike norme en standaarde ongetwyfeld ook in die slag bly. Enkele voorbedde van organisasies wat dit vandag in Suid-Afrika hulle taak maak om die orde te vernietig, is die arbeidsvleuel van die ANC, die S.A. Congress of Trade Unions, met al sy verknegte vakbondorganisasies soos die S.A. Allied Union en die anti Indi&#x00EB;rraadgroepe&#x2014;hulle is almal besig om die bestaande orde in Suid-Afrika te versteur. In die verband wonder ek of die tyd nie aangebreek het dat daar weer &#x2019;n slag intensief na hierdie en soortgelyke organisasies gekyk moet word nie.</p>

<p>In die voorste linie teen hierdie magte van geweld, hierdie mense wat ons ordelike samelewing wil omverwerp, wat daarop toegespits is om die saak van die bose in Suid-Afrika te bevorder, in hierdie voorste linie staan 34 000 polisiemanne en-vroue, Blankes, gekleurdes en Swart mense. Hulle werk onvermoeid om, volgens die treffende woorde van hulle credo, te kan nakom wat hulle vir hulself daargestel het.</p>

<p>In die stryd ter beveiliging van al die dinge wat vir ons almal van waarde is, ook vir die PFP, het die S.A. Polisie oor die afgelope dekades merkwaardige suksesse behaal. So is dit &#x2019;n voldonge feit dat die S.A. Polisie en in die besonder ons Veiligheidspolisie oor die afgelope meer as twee dekades, daarin geslaag het om die kommunistiese aanslag teen die Republiek van Suid-Afrika doeltreffend af te weer. As die suksesse wat die kommuniste dwarsoor die &#x00F2; gehad het, as maatstaf gebruik word, dan is dit werklik &#x2019;n merkwaardige prestasie wat hier deur die S.A. Polisie behaal is. So het ons beleef die opruiming van die kommunistiese nes te Rivonia, het ons die opsporing van Bram Fischer gehad en ook ander voorbedde van die skitterende werk wat deur hierdie manne gedoen is. Terwyl ek daarmee besig is, wil ek graag die huidige hoof van die Veiligheidspolisie in Suid-Afrika, genl.-maj. Johan Coetzee, gelukwens met sy bevordering tot luitenant-generaal. Ons dink dat dit welverdiend is en ons wens hom graag daarmee geluk.</p>

<p>Meer resente voorbedde van die werk van ons polisie is die ondersoeke wat voortgespruit het uit die bloedige terroriste-aanval op die Volkskasbank in Silverton, Pretoria. Ten tyde van hierdie tragiese voorval was die polisie reeds besig met &#x2019;n landswye ondersoek na verskeie terroriste-dade wat op verskillende plekke in Suid-Afrika gepleeg is. Inderwaarheid was dit op daardie tydstip die onbenydenswaardige taak van die polisie om te soek na &#x2019;n groep gesiglose misdadigers, onbekende terroriste wat met vervalste identiteitsdokumente, in siviele drag tussen die gewone mense rondbeweeg het. Toe ons <span class="col_585-586" refersTo="page_0312"/>hulle uiteindelik vang, het ons o.a. gevind dat twee van hierdie mense in die gewaad van priesters rondgeloop het. Maar dit alles het nie gehelp nie, en uiteindelik het die polisie nege opgeleide en gevaarlike terroriste aangekeer.</p>

<p>Uit die verhoor het dit geblyk dat hierdie woestaards, want hulle was niks anders nie, goed opgelei en goed toegerus was met die allermodernste wapens, AK 47-gewere, RPG-lanseerbuise en handgranate. Dit het ook geblyk dat hulle nie ontsien het om moord en doodslag in ons land te kom pleeg nie. Van hierdie nege is uiteindelik dan ook drie deur die hof ter dood veroordeel op aanklagte van hoogverraad. Die res van die bende het swaar vonnisse van tronkstraf gekry. Dit is duidelik dat, as die polisie nie hierdie bende opgespoor en aangekeer het nie, hulle groot skade en bloedvergieting in Suid-Afrika sou veroorsaak het. Die polisie het dan ook met reg &#x2019;n kompliment van die verhoorregter ontvang vir hulle harde werk, deeglike ondersoek en bekwame voorbereiding van die saak. Selfs die advokate vir die verdediging het hulle lof toegeswaai.</p>

<p>Te midde van hierdie kommunistiese aanslag het daar gedurende 1980 ook &#x2019;n sabotasieveldtog vanuit regse politieke groepe losgebars, en is daar talie dade van terrorisme gepleeg. Ten spyte van insinuasies uit sommige oorde dat die polisie dan partydig sou wees, is di&#x00E9; mense net so genadeloos gejag en opgespoor. Ons het in die afgelope paar dae gesien dat van hierdie mense ook in die Pretoriase hooggeregshof skuldig bevind is.</p>

<p>Dit is bewys dat ons polisie in die eerste plek in die handhawing van wet en orde ge&#x00EF;nteresseerd is en dat hulle almal wat dit bedreig as vyande beskou, wat hulle vasberade en doelgerig sal beveg. Hierdie terreuraanslag duur vandag nog voort. Groepe terroriste slaan nog oral toe. Ons het hulle die afgelope tyd in Oos-Kaapland gehad. Maar die polisie het baie vinnig op hulle toegeslaan en hulle uitgewis. Ons het die afgelope tyd gehoor dat hierdie mense ook op Voortrekkerhoogte toegeslaan het, en ook &#x2019;n polisiestasie by Mabopane in Bophuthatswana aangeval het. Ons kan verwag dat hierdie vlaag van geweld teen Suid-Afrika nie sal afneem nie, inteendeel dit sal toeneem. Tussen ons en hierdie vlaag van geweld, staan daar die polisieman en polisievrou van Suid-Afrika&#x2014;wat hulle sal opspoor en genadeloos uitwis,&#x2014;ons weet dit.</p>

<p>Die polisie kon oor die jare staatmaak op die ondersteuning en aktiewe hulp van talie verantwoordelike, vredeliewende mense en organisasies. &#x2019;n Skitterende voorbeeld van die baie goeie samewerking van ons publiek is te vinde in die suksesse wat nou behaal word met die program &#x201E;Police File&#x201D;. Sedert die eerste uitsending van hierdie program op 4 Februarie van hierdie jaar plaasgevind het tot op hede is nagenoeg 18 programme uitgesaai. Die soort sake wat op die televisie gebeeldsaai is, het gewissel van moord, roof en diefstal tot handel in diamante. Gedurende hierdie tydperk is daar 187 sake in die programme gemeld. Daarvan is 99 direk opgelos. Wat egter veral verbasend is, is dat sowat 302 sake wat met hierdie sake verband gehou het,&#x2014;waarmee van die betrokke misdadigers verbind kon word,&#x2014;ook terselfdertyd deur die polisie opgelos kon word. Dit is asof daar onder ons mense &#x2019;n ontploffing in publieke belangstelling in die bekamping van misdaad gekom het. Die reaksie op &#x201E;Police File&#x201D; is so geweldig dat &#x2019;n spesiale span speurders in diens geplaas moes word om die inligting, wat binne minute nadat die program begin, reeds begin instroom, te hanteer en met ondersoeke daarna te begin. Ek dink dit is pragtig, en ons dank gaan aan die publiek wat so mooi reageer. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Baie dankie, mnr. die Voorsitter. My dank ook aan die agb. Sweep van die Opposisie. Ek het ges&#x00EA; dat dit pragtig is, en dat ons graag die publiek wil bedank en ook die polisie wat hierdie werk doen, maar dan kan ons ook nie anders as om dankie te s&#x00EA; aan mnr. David Hall-Green en mev. Graham van die SAUK-TV wat vir die program verantwoordelik is nie.</p>

<p>In skrille kontras hiermee is daar egter vandag doelgerigte pogings om dit vir ons polisie moeiliker te maak. Daar is die optrede van sekere mense selfs in leiersposisies in Suid-Afrika, wat daarop uit is om die rus en vrede te versteur, om onrus en wanorde aan te blaas. Ek wil in die verband in die laaste paar minute tot my beskikking verwys na die bedrywighede van biskop <span class="col_587-588" refersTo="page_0313"/>Tutu, die Sekretaris-generaal van die S.A. Raad van Kerke; en ook die S.A. Raad van Kerke. Ons het respek vir geestelikes, dit is in ons aard, ons is so grootgemaak, maar as &#x2019;n geestelike o.a. soos volg bid, dan maak ons beswaar daarteen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hear us o Lord when we pray. We pray for the downfall of this Government so that in its place a new Government will come. A Government that will be based on justice. A policy that proves this of ours today cannot be defined as anything else but sin. For apartheid is sin. Separate development is sin. Those are the machines of oppression.</block>

<p>Dit is nie &#x2019;n ou storie nie. Hierdie biskop bid so by Regina Mundikerksaal in Soweto op 16 Junie 1981. By dieselfde kerklike geleentheid s&#x00EA; &#x2019;n ander spreker, dr. Harrison Motlana, o.a. die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It makes our job immeasurably easier if we have our Jesus Christ, our Lord, on Robben Island. The man who has shown us the way. The man who says follow me and I&#x2019;ll lead you into a land of milk and honey. And say that our enemy is the White man who stole our land. That is our enemy unto death.</block>

<p>Die tyd laat my nie toe om verdere getuienis aan te haal wat duidelik daarop dui dat hier pogings is om in Suid-Afrika onrus en wanorde te saai nie. Daar is talie gevalle waar die kerk direk of indirek betrek word by hierdie poging tot wanorde, tot die aanblaas van chaos en bloedvergieting, bv. die betrokkenheid van die S.A. Raad van Kerke by die plakkersprobleme in Langa, by die massavergadering hier in die St. Georges-katedraal, ens. Die agb. lid vir Houghton was daar. Sy weet hoe dit daar gegaan het, wat alles daar gedoen is. Of ons dit nou wil weet of nie, die kerke waarvan biskop Tutu die Sekretaris-generaal is, word onafwendbaar betrek by hierdie opsweping van gevoelens, by hierdie ondermyning van gesag. Dit word gedoen deur gewetenlose politieke priesters wat nie die oogmerke van die ware godsdiens nastreef nie maar wat die priestelike kleed en die Woord van God misbruik om hulle eie duistere motiewe te bevorder. Ek kan nie glo dat dit die goedkeuring wegdra van die baie duisende Christene, Christen-gelowiges, wat lede van daardie kerke is nie. Hulle is mos gewone mense soos ons, wat wil sien dat daar reg en geregtigheid in Suid-Afrika geskied, maar dat dit op ordelike wyse bewerkstellig word. Dit mag nie kom deur die vergieting van bloed en chaos en wanorde nie. Omdat ek dit glo, glo dat dit so is, daarom glo ek ook dat die tyd aangebreek het dat daardie stilswyende meerderheid van Christene wat deur die politieke agitators van die S.A. Raad van Kerke misbruik word, sal opstaan, van hulle sal laat hoor en hulle sal distansieer van dit wat vandag in die naam van hulle kerke gedoen word; dat hulle sal weier dat hulle kerke langer vir hierdie skadelike en goddelose doelstellings misbruik word.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have neither the time, nor, may I add, the religious capacity to enter into an argument with the hon. member for Verwoerdburg on the sermons preached by Bishop Tutu and Dr. Motlana.</p>

<p>Because I am not a Christian and I have only 10 minutes. Does that answer the question? It might occur to the hon. member and to other hon. members that these men are embittered men because they do not have a constitutional right to oppose this Government, and therefore they have to take whatever methods they do have to oppose the Government within the law. They have no vote, they cannot throw this Government out. Dr. Motlana, when he wants to travel overseas, must go and get a passport in an area where he has never set foot, in other words Bophuthatswana, having been born in Pretoria and having lived all his life in Pretoria or Johannesburg. It might occur to hon. members that these people have genuine grievances. Maybe if they do something to set those grievances right, Bishop Tutu and Dr. Motlana would not be making these aggressive statements about the Government. I would also like to say to the hon. member for Verwoerdburg that it is one thing to talk about the total onslaught and include the people who are genuinely working for the destruction of South Africa, and another thing for <span class="col_589-590" refersTo="page_0314"/>the hon. the Minister of Police to back up the hon. the Minister of Co-operation and Development, for instance when he makes the absurd statement that there was an orchestrated attempt to send back the squatters from Transkei to Nyanga. When the hon. the Minister said he had evidence, the hon. the Minister of Police said that it was so. I challenge him now to produce that evidence.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No evidence whatsoever was produced, only statements that they knew this was so, and thát would not hold up in any court of law as the hon. the Minister, who is a lawyer, well knows. If they have evidence, I challenge him to take those people to court, to prosecute them, because the accusation against them&#x2014;of promoting civil disobedience&#x2014;is a very serious accusation indeed.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to ask the Minister about two matters. The first arises directly out of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee that was appointed by the S.A. Medical Association to look into the Biko case. I want to confine myself to the aspects of the report that affect the Police. The Committee may know that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee consisted of two very eminent men, Advocate Maisels who acts, I might add, as a judge in the BSL countries, and also the ex-Rector of the University of Stellenbosch, Prof. J. N. de Villiers. The relevant part of the report draws attention to the fact that a warrant was issued by the Commissioner of Police under section 6 of the Terrorism Act&#x2014;it was issued post-Biko&#x2014;and that a standing order was also issued post-Biko by the Police. Both were an improvement certainly on the pre-Biko position, but the committee nevertheless points out that neither the warrant nor the standing order has the force of law. In other words, they are not legally enforceable. It is true that a policeman could, of course, find himself subject to disciplinary action if he did not obey the standing order, but that is very different from a provision on the Statute Book which has the force of law. Moreover, neither the warrant nor the standing order is published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> or made known to the public at large in any way. Their contents are really known only to the Police. The standing order should, says the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, &#x201C;be made known and copies thereof be given to all medical practitioners who may be called in by the Police&#x201D; in the case of the illness of a detainee. This is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility, because detainees fall under the Security Police.</p>

<p>The committee also recommends that the standing instructions be made legally enforceable, thus increasing their ambit beyond that of mere disciplinary action.</p>

<p>The third important recommendation made by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee was that head office, i.e. the security branch of Police headquarters in Pretoria, should not have the final say in the event of a detainee having to be removed for treatment in a hospital other than a prison hospital, if the Police happen to disagree with the opinion of the doctor. The head office in Pretoria should certainly not have the final say.</p>

<p>The committee recommends that another doctor be called in, and if his opinion agrees with that of the prison doctor, that should be the deciding factor and not the opinion of head office.</p>

<p>The committee states that its recommendations are made&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; not merely in the interests of the detainee or of the medical profession &#x2026;</block>

<p>which I might say has suffered severely as a result of the Biko case, and particularly as a result of the actions of the doctors in that case&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but also in the interests of the State. &#x201C;Biko&#x201D; is, in our opinion, sufficient justification for our views.</block>

<p>The implication is absolutely clear. The committee wants to avoid, at all costs, another Biko incident, as indeed I believe we all do. We all know what damage has been done to South Africa as a result of that case.</p>

<p>It is very interesting to note that since Biko died, which was in 1977, no person detained in terms of the security laws has died in detention. There have been no more deaths. This is a welcome change from the <span class="col_591-592" refersTo="page_0315"/>situation that obtained in the years between 1963 and 1977 when 43 people died whilst in detention under the security legislation, i.e. either the 90-day detention legislation or section 6 of the Terrorism Act. Some of these people were alleged to have died as a result of extraordinary accidents like slipping on a cake of soap or falling out of windows, but many were alleged to have committed suicide. The statement by the then Minister of Police was that they committed suicide in obedience to an order issued by the Communist Party which stated that they had to &#x201C;commit suicide rather than betray the party&#x201D;. At the same time, though, the hon. the Minister &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Just a minute please, just a minute! Pipe down! At the same time the hon. the Minister was denying hotly that there was any torture, and it is beyond me why anybody has to commit suicide rather than betray the party if there is no torture involved. All a man would have had to do would have been to keep silent. That is all. It was therefore a very extraordinary explanation that was given. As I say, however, there have been no more deaths, and that is something for which we are all very thankful. I believe it is largely as a result of new instructions being issued about the handling of people being interrogated. I also, however, believe that there is nothing like making doubly sure that we do not have any more &#x201C;Bikos&#x201D;. In the light of the recommendations made by this committee, on which two such eminent ment served, I ask the hon. the Minister whether he has taken any steps in this connection, and if not, why not? All he has to do is introduce a simple amendment to the Police Act in a General Law Amendment Bill. That is something he could do, very easily, this session.</p>

<p>Another subject I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister involves how the Police employ their valuable time. The hon. member for Musgrave has rightly said that the Police do not enjoy all their duties. My point is also that there is a great deal of serious crime that goes unsolved whilst the Police have to spend their time harassing people for statutory offences. Many people are still being arrested contrary to a standing instructtion&#x2014;again bearing out the point made by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of MASA that a standing instruction does not have the force of law&#x2014;about the production of documents on demand. Many people are still being arrested without being given a chance to produce their documents.</p>

<p>The Black Taxation Act, for instance, was repealed in 1980, and yet Blacks are still being harassed retrospectively for the nonpayment of head tax. I think that a little intelligence, a little selectivity, on the part of those who give the orders, and perhaps a little less enthusiasm on the part of those who carry out the laws, would result in very much better race relations in South Africa. Let us drop the harassment in terms of laws which are, in any case, due for change and which we have been told, in Government White Papers and in ministerial statements, are going to be changed anyway. So let us, in the interim, until those changes come about &#x2014;which one certainly hopes is going to happen&#x2014;have the Police given the instruction to &#x201C;hamba kahle&#x201D; on the sort of laws &#x2026;</p>

[Interjections.] I am not a child, and I certainly do realize that.</p>

<p>I want to point out that last year, in Soweto alone, there were 11 467 reported cases of violent crime. That is what the Police should be occupying their time with. Less than half those cases, however, were ever brought to trial, which means they were not solved. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. WESSELS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek gaan nie nou reageer op die toesprake van die agb. lid vir Berea en die agb. lid vir <span class="col_593-594" refersTo="page_0316"/>Houghton nie. As die tyd my toelaat, hoop ek om aan die einde van my toespraak oor enkele sake met hulle in debat te tree.</p>

<p>Die S.A. Polisie is &#x2019;n gedissiplineerde Mag wat met reg &#x2019;n groot deel van sy sukses aan hierdie feit kan toeskryf. Die motivering om onder moeilike omstandighede verdagtes te agtervolg en lang werkskofte in ongure weersomstandighede af te handel, sonder om hul waaksaamheid te verslap, is eie aan die pligsbesef van die S.A. Polisie waaraan die publiek van Suid-Afrika so gewoond geraak het. Dit is hierdie verhale wat die publiek van Suid-Afrika met trots vervul en wat meebring dat die S.A. Polisie die gemeenskaplike eiendom van die ganse Suid-Afrika geword het. Om hierdie bepaalde rede, meen ek, staan dit &#x2019;n polisieman vry om die burgervryhede op te eis wat Jan Alleman ook gegun word. Daarom behoort &#x2019;n polisieman binne die beperkinge van sy beroep ook vry te wees om &#x2019;n lid van &#x2019;n politieke party te wees en aan die aktiwiteite van &#x2019;n politieke party deel te neem, onderworpe natuurlik aan die feit dat sy ampspligte enersyds nie ondermyn word nie, en andersyds dat die interne dissipline van die Polisiemag nie daardeur geskend word nie.</p>

<p>Indien ons die Suid-Afrikaanse polisieman ook hierdie partypolitieke vryheid gun, is dit van wesenlike belang dat ons toesien dat die kommunikasiestruktuur wat ook binne die Polisiemag geld, van so &#x2019;n aard is dat niemand hierdie vryheid sal misbruik ten einde die Polisie en sy ampspligte op &#x2019;n slordige manier by partypolitieke aangeleenthede te betrek nie. Kortom, die versoeking moet nie sodanig wees dat &#x2019;n Polisiebeampte &#x2019;n partypolitieke instelling sal wil benut om &#x2019;n saak van interne belang te stel nie.</p>

<p>Daarom was die agb. lid vir Berea se opmerking myns insiens nie geregverdig nie. Die Polisie verdien besondere krediet vir die dinge wat hulle doen om vanuit die generale staf kontak te maak&#x2014;in der waarheid kontak te soek&#x2014;met verskillende afdelings deur skriftelike voorleggings van manskappe te ontvang en te oorweeg.</p>

<p>Omdat die Polisie in &#x2019;n gees van dissipline funksioneer, is dit buite die kwessie dat daar enige sprake kan wees van &#x2019;n organisasie soos &#x2019;n Polisievakbond. Die interne kommunikasiestruktuur durf egter nooit onderontwikkel wees nie. Deurlopende ondersoek, aandag en oorweging van personeel aangeleenthede is van wesenlike belang in die Polisie. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens kan met reg s&#x00EA; dat hierdie arm voortdurend aandag moet geniet en uitgebou moet word.</p>

<p>Teenoor hierdie reg wat die polisieman opeis en wat hom ook gegun word, bestaan daar egter die verpligting dat party politici en hul instellings nie die Polisie op &#x2019;n slordige wyse in die politieke arena sal betrek nie. Die kwessie van Staatsfondse en enigiets wat &#x2019;n kleurkonnotasie het, is seer sekerlik in Suid-Afrika al gepolitiseer. Die Polisie is egter in &#x2019;n groot mate daarvoor verantwoordelik om die binnelandse orde en veiligheid te handhaaf. Ons het dus gewoond geraak aan &#x2019;n vriendelike, hulpvaardige polisiebeampte wat die publiek dienswillig is, maar hierdie beeld het &#x2019;n kollega bygekry, en dit is die beeld van &#x2019;n sterk maar redelike persoon wat onrus besweer, stedelike terreur bekamp en somtyds ook besoeke bring aan plekke soos Moskou, soos ook aangedui word in die September-uitgawe van die Polisietydskrif <i>Servamus.</i> Nog nooit tevore is daar so berekend &#x2019;n aanslag op Suid-Afrika se binnelandse orde en veiligheid gedoen nie. Dit is om hierdie rede van kardinale belang dat die Parlement as &#x2019;n instelling uit een mond sal praat. Die gunstige standpunt wat parlement&#x00EA;re politieke partye ingeneem het met betrekking tot die Weermag se inval in Angola het ons almal tot vreugde gestem, maar die S.A. Polisie, as eerste verdedigingslinie in die binnelandse opset van Suid-Afrika, kan uit eie reg ook aanspraak maak op soortgelyke parlement&#x00EA;re ondersteuning.</p>

<p>Kragtens Wet 76 van 1976, die Wet op die Parlement&#x00EA;re Kommissie vir Binnelandse Veiligheid, word voorsiening gemaak vir &#x2019;n parlement&#x00EA;re kommissie om inligting oor binnelandse veiligheid te bekom, te evalueer en aan die Parlement beskikbaar te stel. Die kommissie het eintlik in onbruik verval voordat dit in werking gestel kon word, en d&#x00ED;t vanwe&#x00EB; die afwysende houding van die Opposisie. Ek besef terde&#x00EB; dat Staatsveiligheid die onderwerp van ondersoek van die Rabie-kommissie was, maar ek kan nie die geleentheid deur die vingers laat glip om die agb. Minister se aandag op die nuttigheid van hierdie instrument te vestig as &#x2019;n metode om met parlement&#x00EA;re betrokkenheid Jan Alleman in te lig oor die veiligheid van Suid-Afrika nie. Ek dink nie dit is regverdig dat hierdie land met onkunde gestraf word <span class="col_595-596" refersTo="page_0317"/>omdat die Opposisie &#x2019;n afwysende houding oor hierdie instelling of soortgelyke instellings inneem nie.</p>

<p>Ek dink ook nie die S.A. Polisie verdien die oningeligte en onsimpatieke beeld in die o&#x00EB; van die publiek omdat so &#x2019;n instelling of soortgelyke instelling ge&#x00EF;gnoreer word nie.</p>

<p>Dit is van kardinale belang om metodes te vind om die publiek te betrek en in te lig oor ons veiligheidsituasie. Moderne probleme is diepliggend. Sonder om sensitiewe inligting te openbaar wat die doeltreffendheid van veiligheidsoperasies in die gevaar kan stel, moet die publiek egter ingelig word oor probleme wat ondervind word en suksesse wat op hierdie terrein behaal word. Ek dink dit is ook geregverdig dat &#x2019;n geleentheid geskep word vir die S.A. Polisie om te spog met die suksesse wat hulle behaal het.</p>

<p>Om te geluister het na die toesprake van die twee agb. lede van die amptelike Opposisie, stem &#x2019;n mens nie alleen tot kommer nie, maar in werklikheid tot droefheid. Dit stem jou tot droefheid om te moet luister na die gesindheid wat deur hulle uitgestraal word. Behalwe vir &#x2019;n paar van die vroe&#x00EB;r opmerkings van die agb. lid vir Berea, toe hy as kampvegter en pleitbesorger vir die S.A. Polisie opgetree het, was daar slegs die een radikale tema dat die &#x201E;political bosses&#x201D; van die Polisie bygekom en afgekam word. As ons toenemend met hierdie houding of gesindheid van die amptelike Opposisie te doen gaan h&#x00EA;, wanneer dit kom by die veiligheidsbelange van Suid-Afrika, sal ons net een keuse gelaat word en dit is om hulle toenemend te konfronteer met hul gesindheid jeens die veiligheidsituasie. Ons sal hulle moet druk om dieselfde standpunt in te neem wat hulle oor ander sake inneem, byvoorbeeld die positiewe noot in verband met die inval in Angola. Ons sal toenemend ook moet vra waar ons dit met mekaar eens is en waar ons van mekaar verskil. In hierdie stadium word ons verskille deur hulle as politieke beleidsverskille aangedui, maar daar is veel meer as net politieke beleids-verskille hierby betrokke. Ek is daarvan oortuig dat dit ook te doen het met die metode of manier van optrede om binnelandse bedreiging af te weer. Daarom kan ons die druk wat ons op hulle uitoefen, nie verslap nie.

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. KLEYNHANS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is vir my &#x2019;n besondere voorreg om op die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Krugersdorp te kan volg. Dit is nie vir ons meer &#x2019;n geheim dat die Suid-Afrikaanse volk &#x2019;n bedreigde volk is nie. Dit is ook nie meer vir ons &#x2019;n geheim dat die Suid-Afrikaanse volk met &#x2019;n oorlewingstryd besig is nie. Dit is eweneens nie &#x2019;n geheim dat bose magte binnelands en buitelands ingespan word om die Christelike beskawing hier aan die suidpunt van Afrika te vernietig nie. Alle regdenkende Suid-Afrikaners is bekommerd oor die toekoms en vra hulself af: Wat hou die toekoms in Suid-Afrika vir ons en ons kinders in, veral as ons kyk na wat oor ons grense gebeur en ook wat daagliks binnelands gebeur?</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Volk wat in so &#x2019;n stryd gewikkel is, kan gelukkig gebruik maak van sekere instrumente om sy voortbestaan te verseker en toe te sien dat hy oorleef in die land van sy herkoms. Ek wil graag aandui hoe ek hierdie instrumente sien. Eerstens moet so &#x2019;n volk die wil h&#x00EA; om voort te bestaan. Tweedens moet so &#x2019;n volk geloof h&#x00EA; in sy voortbestaan. Hierdie twee vereistes kan nie op &#x2019;n wetenskaplike manier verkry word nie. Hulle moet eie wees aan so &#x2019;n volk se karakter. Dit moet as &#x2019;t ware ingebore wees. Derdens moet so &#x2019;n volk &#x2019;n sterk ekonomie h&#x00EA; sodat die ander hulpmiddels in stand gehou kan word. Vierdens&#x2014;en dit is uiters belangrik&#x2014;moet so &#x2019;n volk binnelandse vrede kan handhaaf. Laastens moet so &#x2019;n volk daartoe in staat wees om sy grense teen indringing deur vernietigingsmagte te beskerm.</p>

<p>Ek wil kortliks kyk na die instrument wat die Suid-Afrikaanse volk tot sy beskikking het om binnelandse vrede, wet en orde te handhaaf. Ek verwys natuurlik na ons S.A. Polisie. Na my beskeie mening, as &#x2019;n mens se vyande daarin kan slaag om binnelandse vrede, wet en orde af te breek, stort die ander hulpmiddels en instrumente in duie. Geen land kan &#x2019;n sterk ekonomie te midde van chaos opbou nie. &#x2019;n Volk se wil om voort te bestaan kan ook afgebreek word deur wetteloosheid en chaos. &#x2019;n Volk se geloof kan die laaste knak kry as hy nie binnelands veilig voel nie. So &#x2019;n volk kan die sterkste magte op sy grense h&#x00EA;, maar as daardie magte nie gerugsteun word deur binnelandse vrede nie, kan sodanige magte nie &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; moreel h&#x00EA; nie. Daarom plaas ek &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; moreel h&#x00EA; nie. Daarom plaas ek &#x2019;n premie <span class="col_597-598" refersTo="page_0318"/>op binnelandse vrede, wet en orde, en daarom plaas ek ook so &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; prioriteit op die werk van ons Polisiemag in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>Wat behels die werksaamhede van die Polisiemag om hierdie vrede te bewaar? Die funksies van die Polisiemag is onder meer die behoud van interne sekuriteit, die instandhouding van wet en orde, die ondersoek van oortredings en beweerde oortredings en die voorkoming van misdaad. Hierdie funksies word somtyds te voet uitgevoer, en in sommige gevalle word die polisieman van &#x2019;n hond vergesei. In minder toeganklike gebiede ry die Polisieman te perd, of in vierwielaangedrewe voertuie of gewone motors. Met ander woorde, waar misdaad ook al mag plaasvind, of waar ons binnelandse vrede ook al in die gedrang kom, daar moet die polisieman wees.</p>

<p>Misdaadondersoek in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika word uitgevoer deur &#x2019;n groep hoogs opgeleide manne wat gebruik maak van die mees wetenskaplike metodes. Die wonderlike sukses wat die S.A. Polisie oor die jare heen gehad het met die aanwending van wetenskaplike metodes om misdaad te bekamp en sekuriteit te handhaaf, het menige voornemende misdadigers laat afsien van hul planne om &#x2019;n misdaad te pleeg of om die veiligheid van die Staat te ondermyn.</p>

<p>Die S.A. Polisie glo daaraan dat die voorkoming van misdaad beter is as die bestryding daarvan. Ek wonder of ons altyd besef wat van ons polisiemanne op die platteland verwag word, veral in gebiede waar ander Staatsdepartement nie kantore het nie?</p>

<p>Vir die rekord moet ons na my mening kortliks kyk wat daar van die polisieman in die klein plekkies verwag word. Daar word onder meer van hom verwag om op te tree as publieke aanklaer, bode van die hof, klerk van die hof, aksynsbeampte, en immigrasiebeampte. Dan moet hy ook die werk doen van die belastinggaarder, hy moet help om kieserslyste op te stel, hy moet optree as &#x2019;n gesondheidsinspekteur en &#x2019;n inspekteur van voertuie. Dan is hy ook nog &#x2019;n agent van die Poskantoor. Daar word ook van hom verwag om die sensusopnames te doen. Hy moet ook optree as &#x2019;n lykshuisbeampte, en in sommige gevalle word daar ook nog van hom verwag om die weer te voorspel. Bring my enige pos waar daar soveel van &#x2019;n man verwag word, en waar daar dan nog ook van hom verwag word om die werk te doen waarvoor hy eintlik aangestel is.</p>

<p>Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; dat ek &#x2019;n geweldige ho&#x00EB; premie plaas op die binnelandse veiligheid van ons land. Daarom wil ek vandag hulde bring aan die 32 095 polisiemanne en-vroue wat oor die lengte en die breedte van ons land versprei is, waar hulle ook al gestasioneer mag wees in een van die 931 stasies en grensposte. Hierdie groep manne en vroue bestaan uit 887 Indi&#x00EB;rs, 1 845 Kleurlinge, 12 939 Swartes en 16 424 Blankes. Waar hulle ook al mag wees, moontlik ver weg van die beskawing, moontlik werksaam in moeilike omstandighede ver van hul eie families, wil ek vandag aan hulle s&#x00EA; dat ons van hulle weet, dat ons aan hulle dink en aan hulle hulde bring, want hulle staan daar as die veiligheidswagtorings sodat die publiek van Suid-Afrika, ten spyte van binnelandse woellinge, nog in vrede kan werk, lewe en slaap.</p>

<p>Ek bring ook hulde aan die man wat die donker straatjies van ons stede moet patrolleer, moontlik net met sy flitslig, die man wat dikwels sy eie lewe moet waag om voortvlugtendes te agtervolg.</p>

<p>Ek is die laaste persoon om ooit vergelykings te wil tref, want ons Staatsopset is &#x2019;n groot masjien met duisende ratte, en elke rat is noodsaaklik vir die funksionering van daardie groot masjien. Daar is egter &#x2019;n vraag wat ek vandag wil stel. Wat is ons in Suid-Afrika bereid om vir ons binnelandse veiligheid te betaal? Sal die besigheidsman, wat rustig kan slaap terwyl sy besigheid opgepas word, nie bereid wees om iets ekstra daarvoor te betaal nie? Sal ek en my gesin, om in rus en vrede te kan lewe, nie bereid wees om iets meer te betaal nie? Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; dat ek &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie op veiligheid plaas, maar as ek &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie daarop plaas, moet ek mos bereid wees om daarvoor te betaal. Ek is bereid om &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie vir my versekeringspolis te betaal. Ek is selfs bereid om my polis te laat laai, maar besef ek dan nie dat as ek nie in hierdie land veiligheid en vrede het nie, daardie polis vir my en my gesin niks sal beteken nie?</p>

<p>Toe ek &#x2019;n jong seun op die platteland was, was daar vir my geen mooier gesig as &#x2019;n polisieman in sy kakie uniform op sy bruin perd nie. Ek het moeite gedoen om hom te sien te kry. Ek het spesiaal vroeg opgestaan om hom te kan sien. Die sersant op die dorp was <span class="col_599-600" refersTo="page_0319"/>&#x2019;n gesiene man. Hy was ingeskakel in die gemeenskapslewe en is deur groot en klein gerespekteer, want daardie gemeenskap het geweet wat hy vir hulle beteken.</p>

<p>Ek wil net vra: Geniet die polisieman nog dieselfde respek van ons gemeenskap wat hy destyds geniet het? [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<speech by="#page">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. W. B. PAGE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be able to follow up on what was said by the hon. member for Algoa, who has just resumed his seat, because he touched on a subject that is very close to my heart. I have, in fact, spoken about it before. I am referring to the respect that should be accorded the policeman at all times. Like that hon. member, I also remember my childhood in a small town where the police sergeant was our father-confessor. In many ways he was the person we always turned to when we were in trouble.</p>

<p>I see that the hon. the Minister is today sporting a button-hole decoration. Obviously he is wearing it with some pride, especially as a symbol of the Force headed by his Commissioner of Police. I think he does so with a lot of justification. I believe that in the past 12 months his Police Force has done an outstanding job of work, and I think they have done this under particularly difficult circumstances, in the sense that they have not overcome the probleem of staff shortages which, to a very great degree, were brought about by what I can only call a complete lack of foresight about remuneration for the members of this Force.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I do not want to dwell on this. There have been increases forthcoming, but I do not think they have been sufficient. I still say and I will continue to propagate as long as I am the spokesman of our party on Police matters, that the hon. the Minister should free the S.A. Police pay-schedules from the Commission for Administration. It is no place for the pay-schedules of the S.A. Police. The S.A. Police Force is what the name indicates. It is a paramilitary organization, the first line of defence. I submit in all humility that these people are not civil servants. I do not say this in a derogatory sense at all. The Police are not to be equated to clerks who serve in other arms of the Civil Service and should be treated for what they are. They are an organization of their own and should be entirely independent as far as pay and service conditions are concerned. I would urge and. I will continue to urge that they be removed from the restrictions that are placed on them by the Commission for Administration.</p>

<p>There is no shadow of doubt in my mind that, once this happens, the problems as far as the shortage of staff is concerned, will be a thing of the past. Then the hon. the Minister will be able to maintain an ongoing investigation in respect of salaries paid. He will be able to be competitive with the private sector and he will not be in the situation where he is training valuable men to a point where they are ripe to be plucked by the private sector and put into jobs as security men at a far better rate of pay. Then he has to start all over again to train a man at tremendous cost to the State.</p>

<p>The annual report reflects some very interesting facts, one of which is that the establishment still reflects a shortage. As at 30 June 1980 the Police Force were short of some 3 000 Whites and 2 000 non-Whites. I would ask the hon. the Minister to give us the position as it is today. I think it would be of interest to this Committee to know what has happened since 30 June 1980 and I hope he can furnish us with the figures for the 12 month period up to 30 June 1981.</p>

<p>I would also like to hear comments from the hon. the Minister on the use of 500 national servicemen who each year bolster the numbers of Police Force. I am rather concerned about this aspect. I believe it is a good thing, but the thing is that these people leave the Force again. I have heard criticism and I do not know whether it is justifiable or not&#x2014;I want the hon. the Minister to reply to this&#x2014;that some of these young men do not take the job seriously and do tend to block the normal advancement of those who join the Force and want to advance in the Force. I have said clearly that I have heard this criticism, but that I do not know whether it is justified. I would like to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s comment and I believe that his comment will be noted by those who have raised this criticism.</p>

<p>A point that interests me, is that in a paragraph dealing with the re-engagement of staff, I note that some 1 133 applications were received from ex-members wishing to rejoin the Force. Of those only 362 were accepted for further screening. I wonder if <span class="col_601-602" refersTo="page_0320"/>we could have elaboration on that, because surely if 1 133 people were in the Police Force they must have been screened to be able to have joined the Force. How is it then that such a low percentage is considered for rescreening and for readmission to the Police Force? It seems to me to be out of proportion with what we would like to see achieved.</p>

<p>In the short time left to me I want to deal with matters parochial. On the North Coast of Natal we have two peculiar situations, if I may call them that. History has given us two little villages, or rather the village of Umhlali, which is south of the Tugela River and south of Stanger, and another little place, if I can call it that, named Inyoni, which is north of the Tugela River. At each of these police stations were situated many years ago. Since then, due to developments, we have had vast influxes of people to areas nearby which are not easily policed by the policemen at either Umhlali or Inyoni. I refer to Ballitoville, which has become a thriving community on the North Coast some 8 to 12 kilometers away from Umhlali. I wish to refer more particularly to Mandini, which is north of the Tugela River. Hon. members may remember that this was originally the village serving Sappi when this company first built its mill there. Mandini is growing beyond all recognition because it is right next door to Isitebe where tremendous industrial development is taking place. Both of these areas are serviced by police stations far removed. I am talking about anything up to 16 km away from the nearest police station. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could not give urgent attention to this situation. There are serious problems being encountered. The willingness to assist is there and I am not for one minute criticizing the policemen, but it is their difficulty in servicing those two burgeoning communities which is creating difficulties. These communities are growing rapidly into enormous communities.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for the assurance, because this matter is of tremendous importance.</p>

<p>Another matter I wish to raise, is that of licences for firearms. Recently I tabled a question asking the hon. the Minister what average time is taken to process firearm licences for pistols, revolvers and sporting rifles. I did this because I think the hon. the Minister would have been rather alarmed about the results. We are facing the situation at the moment&#x2014;I have one case before me, but I do know of others&#x2014;concerning people who have purchased firearms. These are expensive commodities. When they purchase a firearm they have to pay for it, have it sealed and lodged with the seller and it is retained by the seller, because the purchaser first has to go to a police station to apply for a firearm licence in the normal way. The case in point is one involving a very prominent citizen of the city of Durban. I do not think he would like me to bandy his name across the Floor, but I will certainly tell the hon. the Minister who I am speaking of. This gentleman bought a pistol on 6 March 1981. After his application had been processed by the local police station, he was advised that it was lodged with the authorities in Pretoria not long thereafter. He has written to me again on 3 September, just the other day, that he still does not have his licence. [Time expired.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil vanmiddag my dank oordra aan die agb. Minister, die Kommissaris van Polisie en die departement vir hulle vriendelikheid en behulpsaamheid wanneer ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad na inligting by hulle op soek is. In hierdie verband is dit veral brig. Van Vuuren wat vir ons voortdurend behulpsaam is met die verkryging van inligting en werklik in hierdie verband moeite doen.</p>

<p>Ek wil die Kommissaris ook van harte bedank vir die baie interessante jaarverslag wat aan ons voorgel&#x00EA; is. Dit is in meer as een opsig &#x2019;n interessante verslag. Na aanleiding van die verslag het ek &#x2019;n interessante woord aangeleer, te wete &#x201E;regsvergrype&#x201D; wat verband hou met wetreglike misdade wat ek voorheen nie geken het nie en wat vir my &#x2019;n mooi vars Afrikaanse woord is. Daar is &#x2019;n paar aspekte in die verslag wat my getref het en waarna ek graag wil verwys.</p>

<p>Die eerste aangeleentheid waarna ek wil verwys, is die geweldige ho&#x00EB; getal opgeloste misdade. In die tweede plek wil ek verwys na die fenomenale afname in sake wat verband <span class="col_603-604" refersTo="page_0321"/>hou met dronkenskap gedurende die verslagjaar in vergelyking met vorige jare. In die derde plek wil ek verwys na die lae persentasie polisiemanne wat as gevolg van wangedrag uit die diens ontslaan is.</p>

<p>Wat die groot getal opgeloste misdade betref, spreek dit boekdele vir die gehalte van ondersoek, die deursettingsvermo&#x00EB; en die kwaliteit van die polisiemanne wat opgesaal is met hierdie ondersoeke. Daar is &#x2019;n paar sakies wat ek graag in hierdie verband opgeklaar wil h&#x00EA;. Op bladsy 8 van die verslag word na verkragtingsake verwys. Veral wat die verkragting van Blanke vroue deur Kleurling-, Asi&#x00EB;r-of Swart mans betref, is daar &#x2019;n groter persentasie gevalle wat onopgelos is. In paragraaf (v)(dd) word die syfers met betrekking tot die onopgeloste persentasie verkragtings van Blanke vroue deur Kleurling-of Asi&#x00EB;rmans soos volg weergegee&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">1977-&#x2019;78&#x2014;67,3&#x0025;<br/>1978-&#x2019;79&#x2014;64,2&#x0025;<br/>1979-&#x2019;80&#x2014;66,2&#x0025;.</block>

<p>Hierdie persentasies is heelwat laer as in die geval van ander soorte verkragtingsake. In paragraaf (v)(bb) is die gemiddelde persentasie sake wat opgelos is, meer as 80&#x0025; en in paragraaf (v)(cc) is die persentasie gemiddelde meer as 70&#x0025;. Miskien kan die agb. Minister hieroor kommentaar lewer.</p>

<p>Wat roofsake betref, word daar op bladsy 9 van die verslag gemeld dat slegs 39,1&#x0025; van sake waar Blankes deur Nieblankes beroof is gedurende 1979-&#x2019;80 opgelos is. Die persentasie opgeloste sake ten opsigte van inbrake waarna in paragraaf (xv) op bladsy 9 verwys word, is ook besonder laag. Miskien kan &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n beter begrip van die probleme kry indien vergelykende syfers in ander lande ook in die verslag vermeld word. Ek moet erken dat ek, wat hierdie aangeleentheid betref, nie oor deskundige kennis beskik nie.</p>

<p>Indien &#x2019;n mens kyk na die groot afname in die gevalle van dronkenskap wat aangemeld is, is dit opmerklik dat vir die jaar 1977-78 daar 221 196 was. In die jaar 1978-79 was daar 244 504 gevalle, maar in die 1979-&#x2019;80 verslagjaar slegs 34 691. Miskien kan die agb. Minister hierdie aspek vir ons opklaar.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou ook verwys na die besondere welslae wat die Handelstak van die S.A. Polisie behaal. Hierdie soort werk is dikwels ingewikkelde werk. Dit gaan nie gepaard met dieselfde mate van spanning nie. Dit het te doen met ondersoeke ingevolge die Maatskappywet, deviesebeheerregulasies, ens., en &#x2019;n besondere soort mens word vereis om daardie werk te doen. Ek wonder of die agb. Minister vir ons kan aandui of daar enigsins beroepsdifferensiasie toegepas kan word met betrekking tot die salarisse van die Handelstak.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander onderwerp waarna ek wil verwys, is die lae persentasie polisiemanne wat ontslaan is weens wangedrag. Die goedgekeurde diensstaat van die Mag is 21 303 Blanke en 17 642 Nieblanke poste. In die jaar 1 September 1980 tot 31 Augustus 1981 was die getalsterkte van die Mag 17 600 Blankes, 2 111 Kleurlinge, 1 125 Indi&#x00EB;rs en 14 300 Swartes, &#x2019;n totaal van 35 136. Vir die jaar ge&#x00EB;indig 30 Junie 1980 is 10 Blankes en 156 Nieblankes weens wangedrag ontslaan. Vir die jaar ge&#x00EB;indig 30 Junie 1981 is 28 Blankes en 221 Nieblankes weens wangedrag ontslaan. As hierdie getalle vergelyk word met die meer as 35 000 polisiemanne in diens van die Mag, getuig dit van &#x2019;n besonder goed gedissiplineerde Mag wat positief ingestel is.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou &#x2019;n paar opmerkings maak met betrekking tot Polisieverhore. In my kiesafdeling en in Wes-Transvaal kom ek dikwels met die polisie in aanraking. Soms is daar die gevoel onder lede van die Mag dat hulle graag &#x2019;n keuse sou wou h&#x00EA; om voor &#x2019;n gewone hof te verskyn en nie voor &#x2019;n offisier of &#x2019;n raad ingevolge die regulasies wat in artikel 61 van die Regulasies ingevolge die Polisiewet vervat is nie. Na aanleiding hiervan het ek hofverslae noukeurig nagegaan om gegewens te verkry oor die getal gerapporteerde sake wat verband hou met polisiemanne wat aangekla is ingevolge regulasies. Dit is opmerklik dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Hofverslae vir die tydperk 1948 tot 1981 slegs van drie sake melding maak wat met sulke verhore verband gehou het. Daar was die saak van <i>Rex</i> vs <i>Supra</i> in 1958 en die <i>Staat</i> vs <i>Matlaba</i> in 1969 en dan die <i>Staat</i> vs <i>Terblanche Wiese en Ander</i> in 1973. Hieruit blyk dit baie duidelik dat in die tydperk 1948 tot 1981 slegs drie sake as belangrik genoeg beskou is om in die S.A. Hofverslae opgeneem te word. In die lig hiervan dink ek nie dat daar fundamentele probleme bestaan <span class="col_605-606" refersTo="page_0322"/>met betrekking tot die Polisieregulasies en die verhore wat daaruit voortspruit nie.</p>

<p>Ons Polisieregulasies is in &#x2019;n groot mate geskoei op die English Army Act van 1879. Ek meen nie daar kan enige twyfel bestaan dat vervolgings ingevolge sodanige regulasies noodsaaklik is nie. Dit is noodsaaklik vir die goeie orde in die Mag. Daar is sekere oortredings wat nie oortredings van die landswette is nie, maar afkeurenswaardig is wanneer dit in die lig van die handhawing van dissipline beskou word. Volgens die ou Wet van 1912 was die maksimum straf wat opgel&#x00EA; kon word, &#x00A3;5. Volgens artikel 91 van die huidige Polisiewet is daar &#x2019;n strafbepaling van R200 of ses maande. In die saak <i>Rex</i> vs <i>Supra</i> is daar ges&#x00EA; dat in die lig van die lang geskiedenis van oortredings wat heeltemal huishoudelik van aard is daar geen probleme met sodanige ondersoeke is nie. Elke polisieman behoort in die lig van sy daaglikse kontak met die regspleging te kan onderskei tussen reg en verkeerd en wat fatsoenlik en gepas is met betrekking tot sy amp al dan nie.</p>

<p>In die verlede het ek al die gebruik van opnamemasjiene waar polisie-offisiere hierdie verhore waarneem, bepleit. In die eerste plek kan daardie polisie-offisiere se tyd baie beter benut word. In die tweede plek moet die rekord van die verhoorverrigtinge wat op &#x2019;n vraag-en-antwoord-grondslag plaasvind en notuleer moet word per hand en dan na &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r gesag gestuur word indien &#x2019;n polisieman teen sy vonnis sou appelleer. Heelwat tyd gaan in die proses verlore. Dit sal die betrokke polisieman ook sielsrus gee indien hy weet dat &#x2019;n volledige rekord aan die Kommissaris voorgel&#x00EA; sal word, indien opname per masjien gedoen kan word.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is vir my vanmiddag &#x2019;n besondere voorreg om die Komitee te kan toespreek. Soos die gebruik is, wil ek agb. lede graag inlig oor die kiesafdeling wat ek verteenwoordig.</p>

<p>Die kiesafdeling Maraisburg bestaan nou alreeds 33 jaar lank en in daardie tydperk was daar baie min herafbakening. In 1948 is oud-Minister Ben Schoeman tot Volksraadslid vir hierdie kiesafdeling verkies en in 1974 is hy deur mnr. A. C. van Wyk opgevolg. Ek wil dan ook graag hulde bring aan my voorganger.</p>

<p>Mnr. Van Wyk dien die kiesafdeling sedert 1949 toe hy as Lid van die Provinsiale Raad vir die kiesafdeling verkies is. Vir 25 jaar lank was hy dan ook Minister Schoeman se regterhand in hierdie kiesafdeling. Hy was &#x2019;n onderwyser wat later tot die partypolitiek toegetree het. Hy was later organiseerder van die party in Transvaal en het gevorder tot Adjunk-sekretaris van die NP in Transvaal. In die provinsiale raad was hy sy party se leier en later ook Lid van die Uitvoerende Komitee. Hy het die kiesafdeling ononderbroke vir &#x2019;n tydperk van 32 jaar verteen-woordig, 21 jaar in die provinsiale raad en 11 jaar in die Volksraad. Vir sy kiesafdeling en die kiesers van Maraisburg het hy sy bes gedoen. Niks was ooit vir hom te veel nie. Hy was &#x2019;n harde werker en goeie mens wat sy gemeenskap opreg gedien het. Ek wil mnr. Van Wyk persoonlik bedank vir sy goeie gesindheid oor die jare en wil namens die kiesers van Maraisburg vir hom en sy gesin net die beste vir die toekoms toewens.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Maraisburg constituency is wedged between two cities, Johannesburg and Roodepoort, and they share common problems. A probleem which is experienced at the moment is the theft of motorcars. In looking at the latest statistics it seems as if this has become a national probleem. For the year ending 31 July 1981 35 086 vehicles were stolen throughout the Republic. The value of these stolen vehicles is estimated at R173 039 690. This means that 96 vehicles are stolen daily, four every hour, in South Africa. Vehicles to the value of R480 000 are stolen every day of the year.</p>

<p>In Roodepoort, where there are some 67 000 registered vehicles 637 were stolen last year. This amounts to one in every 100 vehicles registered. The S.A. Police, the provincial inspectorate and the municipal traffic departments are doing their utmost to curb this probleem. As against the 35 086 vehicles stolen 28 665 were recovered over the same period. As against the 637 that were stolen in Roodepoort 370 were recovered. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the vehicles recovered were extensively damaged or dismantled.</p>

<p>This country cannot afford this unnecessary loss and something must be done to assist <span class="col_607-608" refersTo="page_0323"/>the Police and the traffic authorities in their efforts to combat this type of crime. In this country of ours where the motor-car plays such an important part the loss of such a means of conveyance is often an untold hardship. This tremendous loss is a contributory factor of inflation and results in very high comprehensive insurance premiums. Not only are financial losses incurred and people inconvenienced, but human relations are strained as a result of this type of crime. This type of crime, because of the people involved, is at the moment bedevilling good relations.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, &#x2019;n mens vra onwillekeurig wat gedoen kan word om hierdie euwel te bekamp. Daar is ongelukkig nie &#x2019;n kitsoplossing nie, maar daar kan moontlik gekyk word na maniere en metodes om die Polisie en ander owerhede in die stryd te help. Ek wil nie beweer dat die wenke wat ek hier aan die hand doen oplossings is nie, maar is tog van mening dat dit die owerhede in hulle stryd teen hierdie soort misdaad kan help.</p>

<p>Dit is tans baie moeilik om &#x2019;n gesteelde voertuig nadat dit deur die diewe van kleur, ens., verander is, uit te ken, selfs deur die eienaar. Gevolglik kan dit dalk help indien die wet so gewysig word dat die bestuurder van &#x2019;n voertuig eienaarskap of die reg op die gebruik van die voertuig behoort te kan bewys indien daar rede bestaan om te vermoed dat die voertuig gesteel is. Dit is tans moeilik om die voertuig uit te ken aan die onderstel-of enjinnommers, aangesien dit baie maklik is om die bestaande nommers uit te wis en met ander nommers te vervang. Hier mag dit dalk van hulp wees om alle voertuie van &#x2019;n eenvormige inligtings-of identiteitsplaat te voorsien wat op &#x2019;n bepaalde plek aangebring kan word. Daar kan ook gedink word aan die aanbring van &#x2019;n moeilik uitwisbare identiteitsnommer aan die onderstel van &#x2019;n voertuig deur die fabrikant sodat &#x2019;n voertuig wat byvoorbeeld uitbrand nogtans identifiseerbaar is. Soos tans die geval is, is dit onmoontlik om &#x2019;n motor wat uitgebrand word&#x2014;dit word dikwels gedoen om vingerafdrukke uit te wis&#x2014;te identifiseer en te koppel aan &#x2019;n bepaalde <i>gesteelde voertuig.</i> Dit wil ook voorkom of die professionele motordief &#x2019;n motor wat in &#x2019;n baie swak toestand is, aankoop en dan &#x2019;n soortgelyke motor steel en di&#x00E9; dan met die veranderede nommers gebruik as sou dit die oorspronklike voertuig wees. Om hierdie praktyk te ontmoedig, kan daar dalk van persone verwag word om hulle te identifiseer wanneer hulle derdepartyversekering uitneem of hemieu, sodat hierdie inligting aangaande die eienaar beskikbaar is om eienaarskap van die voertuig te kan bevestig.</p>

<p>Ongelukkig is daar ook nie &#x2019;n eenvormige tipe letter-of syferstempel wat deur die plaaslike owerhede gebruik word om enjinof onderstelnommers wat vervang moet word, mee te graveer nie en gevolglik is dit vir die Polisie uiters moeilik om vas te stel of die nommers eg is al dan nie.</p>

<p>Die motoris kan ook sy deel bring en toesien dat hy nie sy motor met die sleutels daarin parkeer nie en die motor ook nie op plekke parkeer waar daar die geleentheid bestaan vir &#x2019;n dief om ongestoord met sy bedrywighede voort te gaan nie. Die motoris moet ook besef dat die huidige motordief &#x2019;n spesialis is en dat die geringste geleentheid deur hom uitgebuit sal word. Hulle word nie maklik deur slotte, alarms, ens., afgeskrik nie, maar hierdie middels help tog in &#x2019;n mate om die steel van &#x2019;n voertuig te bemoeilik en om die amateurdief af te skrik.</p>

<p>Hierdie probleem verdien aandag en ter wille van die ekonomiese implikasies en die behoud van goeie menseverhoudings moet alles in die stryd gewerp word om dit te bekamp.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I take this opportunity of congratulating the hon. member for Maraisburg on his maiden speech. We can see that he made a thorough study of the subject he raised here in such a competent manner. What he spoke about here today, is something of great importance and I hope the hon. the Minister will heed what the hon. member said. Perhaps my calculator is not as accurate as that of the hon. member, because I had calculated from statistics contained in the annual report that 107 vehicles are stolen every day and that every 13.35 minutes a vehicle is stolen in South Africa. What is disturbing is the item that appears in the report, viz. that 11 311 vehicles were not recovered last year and approximately the same figure the year before. This is very disturbing. There is obviously a tremendous racket going on with regard to the theft of motor-cars. Unfortunately, <span class="col_609-610" refersTo="page_0324"/>the recovery rate of stolen vehicles is very low and the Police must obviously give this matter their attention. The methods suggested by the hon. member for Maraisburg need attention. We have discussed the matter of code numbers on cars being imprinted on the inside of the windows, which can never be erased. I think that certain local authorities and the Police are looking into this matter and I am sure that this method wil help in being able to identify stolen vehicles.</p>

<p>We know that the policeman has a tough job. We know that a policeman has to have many qualities. He must show toughness and at the same time have tact. He must show bravery, but at the same time he should have mercy. He must be a defender and protector, and yet must be the friend of the people so that people can go to him and know that his presence will protect them. That is the image a policeman should have. The Police themselves have shown tremendous bravery in many respects. We saw what happened with the Silverton incident. I have had the personal experience, as the hon. the Minister and some hon. members will know, of visiting policemen on the border. I know that they do a tremendous job and we can only admire them for what they do. The Police passing out parade to which I went in Pretoria was very impressive particularly the servicemen also serving in the Police as well as the women who passed out as police officers. The display at Durban during the Republic Day celebrations which we saw on television is another positive factor commending the Police for their splendid efforts in this regard.</p>

<p>When we offer our criticism we do not criticize the policeman because our criticism really relates to the policy behind the administration of the Police itself. There are some areas which we have to cover. The main probleem facing the Police today is clearly the lack of personnel to fill the various posts. According to the report before us the establishment of the Force is 21 303 White posts after a further 185 posts were added but the actual strength is 3 118 below that figure which represents a shortfall of 22,1&#x0025;. As far as the Blacks are concerned their actual strength is 1 936 below the establishment. Obviously the question of pay must be very important to a policeman. He not only serves in these typical conditions, has hours which are unconventional and has to endure the interruption of his family life by working overtime, but we nevertheless treat him the same as any other member of the services. I have stated on several occasions&#x2014;as the hon. member for Umhlanga has mentioned again&#x2014;that the only way we are going to get the pay scales right and some sort of satisfaction in regard to basic pay and conditions of service, is to take the Police Force away from the control of the Commission for Administration. Once we have done that, we will get somewhere. The question of overtime has also caused a lot of difficulty. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will use the opportunity today to explain on what basis overtime is worked. I believe there was a circular to the effect that overtime is withdrawn but I am not sure whether this did, in fact, happen.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. the Minister will use the term that is currently used so that if policemen work beyond their normal working hours, we will know what they get in respect thereof. As far as our policemen doing border duty are concerned, I want to say that they are doing a tremendous job. The probleem is, however, that the establishment in the local police station still remains the same while their colleagues do border duty. The policemen who remain behind in the stations accordingly also have to work for those who have gone as the establishment makes no provision for extra posts to allow for policemen who are away on border duty. Therefore, there are major police stations where one finds only a few people on duty over the weekend. I will not give any more details for obvious reasons. As far as Hillbrow is concerned, I know that that police station was down to 43&#x0025; of its establishment last time we had meetings there. The area within the jurisdiction of the Hillbrow police station&#x2014;and I want to take that station as an example&#x2014;is <span class="col_611-612" refersTo="page_0325"/>far too wide and it covers something like nine different suburbs. I think that area is too extensive for a single police station. There should be another police station somewhere in the vicinity of Yeoville or Observatory. It is a complex metropolitan high-density area and there is a high crime rate. The number of cases where thefts out of motor-cars occurred alone amounted to an average of 104 per month according to reports I obtained from that station. Cases of this nature within the area of that police station&#x2019;s jurisdiction amounted to 385 and in only four cases recoveries were made. As far as theft of motor cars are concerned 41 such cases occurred in Hillbrow alone while a further 188 occurred in the area. 28 cases of housebreaking occurred in the Hillbrow area and 116 in the area of jurisdiction of the police station.</p>

<p>Just during one month. A liaison committee was set up by the Witwatersrand Command of the Police. We met on the first Tuesday every month and made proposals from time to time. We had meaningful discussions with the Police and we pointed out areas where Police attention was required. We actually had a meeting in a flat in Hillbrow where many tenants were present and which was also attended by a brigadier of the Police. Complaints were mentioned and they accordingly know what the people want and yet they cannot cope with the probleem in a high-density area such as Hillbrow. It is the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy that it is much better to prevent crime and what better method of crime prevention can there be than a patrolling policeman on the beat. Whenever anyone driving a motorcar sees a traffic policeman, he immediately slows down.</p>

<p>If you are like some people, you will drive through a speed trap.

This was said at the meeting we held, during the subsequent discussions and in petitions that were sent to the hon. the Minister. There is no better substitute as far as crime prevention is concerned than a bobby on the beat because that acts as a deterrent for crime. There is already a low recovery rate as far as many of the crimes are concerned.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek meen dat dit vir my nou &#x2019;n gele&#x00EB; tyd is om op die debat te antwoord. Voor ek dit egter doen, wil ek die agb. lid vir Maraisburg met sy eerstelingtoespraak gelukwens. Hy het twee lede van die Raad opgevolg wat besondere dienste gelewer het. In die eerste instansie verwys ek na oudminister Schoeman wat hierdie kiesafdeling sedert 1948 verteenwoordig het en daarna sy voorganger wat ook besondere dienste gelewer het. Die agb. lid het vanmiddag &#x2019;n netjiese vertoning gelewer met &#x2019;n goed-voorbereide toespraak en dit is duidelik dat indien hy so aanhou hy &#x2019;n besondere bydrae in die Raad sal lewer. Ek wil hom weer eens hartlik gelukwens met sy bydrae.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag in hierdie stadium enkele sake aanroer wat reeds deur sommige agb. lede aan die oorkant en deur sommige agb. lede aan hierdie kant bespreek is omdat ek meen dat dit &#x2019;n baie bre&#x00EB; terrein dek wat ons moontlik vrugbaar nou kan bespreek. Later in die debat sal ek in meer besonderhede antwoord op sake wat in agb. lede se toesprake geopper is. In die loop van die antwoord wat ek nou sal gee sal ek antwoord op <span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_0326"/>verskeie van die aspekte wat die agb. lid vir Berea geopper het.</p>

<p>Hier is vanmiddag reeds na die veiligheid-situasie in Suid-Afrika verwys en ons asook die Polisie se betrokkenheid daarby. Weens die beperkte tyd is vanmiddag nie die gele&#x00EB;tyd om &#x2019;n oorsig oor die binnelandse veilig-heidsituasie te gee nie hoewel &#x2019;n mens dit baie graag sou wou doen. Moontlik sal dit by &#x2019;n ander geleentheid gedoen kan word. Ek wil graag vanmiddag net een besondere aspek uitlig omdat dit volgens my mening nodig is dat by hierdie geleentheid daaroor gepraat sal word.</p>

<p>The South African Council of Churches, particularly the General Secretary, Bishop Tutu accuses this Government of following a policy which will lead to a church-state confrontation and I think today is the opportune moment to examine this accusation more closely. Bishop Tutu, who never has, never will and, in fact, dare not utter a word of criticism about the ANC and its terrorist activities and who refuses, with his council, to visit the operational area where White and Black South Africans jointly defend their country, seems to find it strange when he is accused of harbouring pro-ANC sympathies and is accused of promoting by his and his council&#x2019;s activities, the following aims and objects which are also that of the ANC. Bishop Tutu preaches disinvestment both inside and outside South Africa, well aware of the fact that the Black population of this country will be the first victims of such a policy and that furthermore such a policy must of necessity lead to a heightening of the revolutionary climate in this country. Surely no unprejudiced person in his right mind in this country can believe that unemployment, poorer working conditions, lesser pay, smaller pensions, fewer job opportunities, in fact, a stunted economic growth programme, will lead to a contented, happy and prosperous Black population. It is purely incidental that the ANC and the South African Council of Churches have been propagating this policy since 1961. The ANC has been propagating this policy since 1961 to bring South Africa to its knees, the first articles appearing in a communist newspaper <i>Fighting Talk.</i> Bishop Tutu and his council, in an effort to undermine the morale and the preparedness of the S.A. Defence Force and the S.A. Police, initiates and supports projects created to support national service dodgers and deserters, at the same time supporting organizations engaged in civil disobedience programmes. He involves the South African Council of Churches with radical and ANC-enslaved trade unions in campaigns to destroy the mechanisms created by the Government to ensure labour peace in this country, to launch boycotts and generally to politicize the economic aspirations of the Black workers. He initiates and supports programmes designed to create a so-called alternative education system for Black peoples. This campaign seems to have as a necessary ingredient bursary favouritism for the children of political radicals, including his own, and the constant slander of all attempts by the authorities to improve Black education. Furthermore, all and sundry are involved in the misuse and abuse of finances to use sensitive issues to further their own political aims such as squatter and resettlement problems. To initiate and support all these issues the Council of South African Churches and its Secretary General do not rely on its own financial resources or that of its member churches but they are mainly, if not exclusively, dependent on outside sources. What are these sources, Mr. Chairman? The funds used by the South African Council of Churches to launch and support actions and activities which are in no way different from those of the ANC&#x2014;and in fact in the majority of cases are closely related and synchronized with that of the ANC&#x2014; emanates mainly from two kinds of sources. Firstly, from Scandinavian Government Agency sources, from sources such as the World Council of Churches, other separate religious groups, the World University Service and other similar groups, all having a common aim, namely the destruction of South Africa. Secondly, funds were obtained from organizations such as the International University Exchange Fund, a fund previously operating from Geneve, Switzerland. This fund not only declared its unequivocal support for the ANC and supported it without any qualification financially, but was also visited on several occasions by Bishop Tutu on his begging trips overseas. He arranged with this fund&#x2014;aware of its true nature&#x2014;to channel funds to the South African Council <span class="col_615-616" refersTo="page_0327"/>of Churches using the World Council of Churches as conduit. In the meantime Bishop Tutu stood up in public in South Africa and stated that the sources of all funds utilized by the South African Council of Churches were untainted, knowing this to be a deliberate falsehood. In an official United Nations publication there appears a speech which Bishop Tutu delivered on 23 March this year before one of the agencies of that body. In this speech he not only delivered a scathing attack on South Africa but called upon all member states of the organization to exert political and diplomatic but especially economic pressure on South Africa to-change its policies. This was done at the same time that ANC engineered attempts were made from the same forum to isolate South Africa economically. In this speech Bishop Tutu is quoted as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We wish to see freedom come in South Africa by reasonably peaceful means and we would like it to come soon.</block>

<p>The purport is crystal clear: Place South Africa under world pressure, especially economic pressure, and use as much violence as is necessary and change will follow. During August this year the South African Council of Churches invited 11 of the most radical trade unions, some with close finks with the ANC trade union SACTU, to a conference at its headquarters ostensibly to discuss pending legislation affecting trade unions. However, at the same time the majority of these unions are involved in all sorts of boycotts and strike actions all in some way negatively affecting the country&#x2019;s economy. At the close of the conference the South African Council of Churches resolved that even although legislation may eventually provide that certain types of strike actions would be illegal, they would disregard the legislation and financially support the perpetrators of such illegal strikes. In <i>The Sowetan</i> of 21 April 1981 Bishop Tutu is quoted as having said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I really do not see myself as a rival to Motlana cum Mandela cum Tambo. I will be glad to bless them.</block>

<p>This is exactly what he did when he led a so-called prayer service held at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto to mourn the death of terrorists killed during the Maputu raid when he declared in the prayer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those whom many Whites and their newspapers called terrorists, those are our sons, those are our brothers, those are our fathers.</block>

<p>He concluded as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Time is fast running out. We shall overcome.</block>

<p>During March this year Mozambique Radio alleged during a transmission that during an overseas visit Bishop Tutu had met the leaders of the ANC and the PAC and had a mandate from them to act as their representative within the country. Furthermore several unregistered trade unions, the majority with known ANC finks and sympathies, as well as the ANC infiltrated COSAS Black consciousness movement are presently engaged in endeavours to create a revolutionary climate in the Western Cape. By exploiting issues such as increased transport tariffs, maintenance schemes for buildings, community problems etc., these organizations are fishing in troubled waters. To them Bishop Tutu sends the following telegram&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are on the winning side. Nothing will stop us now.</block>

<p>I can give further examples of Bishop Tutu and his South African Council of Churches&#x2019; attitude in the defence of accused persons who find themselves in Botswana at present. These are persons who are accused of stealing arms and ammunition. I will not be surprised if they are also members of the ANC, and the SACC is paying their legal expenses and also looking after them. I have referred to the ANC&#x2019;s sympathies in regard to the Maputo raid and I would also like to refer to the fact that a certain Mr. Peter Moll who served a sentence for being a so-called conscientious objector and thereafter refused to do military service, was sent to South America by the South African Council of Churches to study the latest methods of nonviolent opposition to the Government, and this is one of the worst forms of civil disobedience.</p>

<p><span class="col_617-618" refersTo="page_0328"/>Mr. Chairman, may I end this part of my introductory speech to call on all responsible individual members of member churches of the South African Council of Churches to seriously ask themselves for how long they are prepared to entertain and accept the fact that the secretary of the South African Council of Churches and/or that particular body favours or supports subversive elements and encourages the build-up of a revolutionary climate in South Africa. I ask them to seriously consider this because this Government finds it increasingly difficult to accept this situation any longer.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag na &#x2019;n ander aspek verwys wat betrekking het op ons veiligheidsituasie en dit is die S.A. Polisie se betrokkenheid op ons grense en in die operasionele gebied. Dit is nie algemeen bekend dat die landsgrense van Suid-Afrika oor &#x2019;n afstand van meer as 3 000 km op &#x2019;n 24-uur grondslag deur lede van die S.A. Polisie gepatrolleer word nie, met betrekking tot algemene polisie take en met betrekking tot die veiligheid van Suid-Afrika. Dit is ook eienaardig genoeg, mnr. die Voorsitter, by baie lede van die publiek nie bekend watter rol die S.A. Polisie in die operasionele gebied speel nie. Uit die aard van die saak wil ek nie die getalle polisiemanne en ons basisse vandag hier bespreek nie, maar ek wil dit tog graag onder die aandag van die Raad bring dat die S.A. Polisie in die operasionele gebied &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol speel as deel van die veiligheidsmagte. Die S.A. Polisie is intens betrokke by alle aksies van die veiligheidsmagte in die operasionele gebied binne Owambo hoewel nie as deel van die Weermag by ander operasies nie. In Owambo het die S.A. Polisie besondere polisi&#x00EB;ringstake, opleidingstake met betrekking tot die plaaslike bevolking se opleiding as polisiebeamptes, die bewaking van belangrike mense, hoofmanne, Ministers ens. Die S.A. Polisie doen ook patrolliewerk in gebiede wat aan hulle toegewys is en hierdie patrolliewerk word onder meer deur voertuie onderneem. In die tydperk van 1 Junie tot 7 September was patrollies van die S.A. Polisie in 50 kontakte met Swapo terroriste betrokke met, in die meeste gevalle, ondersteuning deur lede van die Le&#x00EB;r of die Lugmag. In hierdie 50 aksies waarin die S.A. Polisie as deel van hul patrolliewerk betrokke was, is 141 terroriste gedood, 23 terroriste gevang bo en behalwe &#x2019;n groot hoeveelheid wapens en ammunisie waarop beslag gel&#x00EA; is. Ek is baie dankbaar om ook te kan meld dat hoewel ons ongevalle onder ons veiligheidsmagte het waaroor ons almal baie jammer is, daar in hierdie tydperk geen lid van die S.A. Polisie gedood is nie, maar een lid van die S.A. Polisie en 16 van die spesiale konstabels van Owambo is gewond tydens hierdie operasies.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook graag &#x2019;n ander aspek uitlig wat aansluit by die vraag wat die agb. lid vir Berea my gevra het, naamlik wat die beeld van die S.A. Polisieman in die gemeenskap is en wat ons benadering ten opsigte van ons taakverrigting is. Ek wil graag aan die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat ons beleid by die S.A. Polisie is dat die polisieman daar is om die publiek te dien binne die bepalings van die wetgewing wat ons werkverrigting vir ons aandui. Dit is in daardie gesindheid wat ons ons werk probeer doen. Ek wil een aspek daarvan uitlig en dit gaan oor onlusbeheer. Van tyd tot tyd kom daar onluste voor. Op die oomblik is dit baie stil waarvoor &#x2019;n mens dankbaar is, maar ons weet dat dit omstandighede is wat weer kan opduik. Daar is ook soms heftige en onnodige kritiek teen die S.A. Polisie. In hierdie verband wil ek graag vandag aan die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat die afdeling van die S.A. Polisie wat met onlusbeheer te doen het uit hoogsopgeleide mense bestaan. Van daardie offisiere is by geleentheid oorsee gestuur om in ander lande na die jongste metodes en tegnieke ondersoek te gaan instel. Hulle het teruggekom en ons offisiere, onder-offisiere en ander lede van die Mag volgens die jongste metodes opgelei. Ons het die afgelope twee jaar en langer uit ons pad gegaan om te sorg dat ons lede die mees moderne hulpmiddels tot hul beskikking het in die bekamping van onlussituasies. Die manne is nie alleen opgeleide en gedissiplineerde mense nie wat met selfbeheersing hul werk moet doen nie, maar hulle het die mees moderne hulpmiddels tot hul beskikking. Vir skarebeheer word allerlei handwapens gebruik, nie pistole en vuurwapens nie, maar handwapens soos knuppels en karwatse. Hulle is ook opgelei in die gebruik van skilde, helms, traanrook, traangasgranate en spuitkannetjies. Die spuitkannetjie is een van die middels wat ek nog graag aan die agb. lid vir Houghton wil gee, mnr. die Voorsitter. Die <span class="col_619-620" refersTo="page_0329"/>niesmasjien is &#x2019;n uitstekende masjien wat ons gebruik en dit werk soos &#x2019;n born. Ek wil die agb. lid vir Houghton ook nog een dag naby een laat verbygaan. Ons gebruik allerlei nuwe plastiese en rubber koe&#x00EB;ls, almal hulpmiddels wat deur die polisie gebruik word om die mins moontlike lewensverlies in &#x2019;n onlus-situasie te veroorsaak. Ons het ook ander moderne hulpmiddels soos kameras, video-apparaat, bandopnemers en luidsprekers. Ons neem so &#x2019;n situasie in sy geheel af want ons het ook al slim geword en ons weet van die kritiek wat na die gebeurtenis aan ons deur gel&#x00EA; kan word. Ons neem dus ons eie filmopname sodat ons dit vir die agb. lid vir Berea en die agb. lid vir Houghton persoonlik kan wys sodat hulle nie weer nodig het om na opnames van die oorsese televisiespanne asook ander kameraspanne wat ons nie so goedgesind is, te kyk nie. Ons kyk deurlopend na hierdie hulpmiddels en die uitrusting wat ons kan gebruik omdat ons daarop ingestel is om die maksimum effekti-witeit te handhaaf tydens &#x2019;n onlus-situasie met &#x2019;n absolute minimum van lewensverlies.</p>

<p>Ons s&#x00EA; steeds, mnr. die Voorsitter, hoewel ons daar is om die publiek te dien en hoewel &#x00F3;ns ons werk met &#x2019;n minimum van geweld wil doen, ons tog aan lede van die publiek wil s&#x00EA; wat enigsins die gedagte in hul kop het om &#x2019;n onlus-of &#x2019;n onrus-situasie in Suid-Afrika te skep dat ons net so sterk as in die verlede sal optree indien dit nodig is en as dit in &#x2019;n gewelddadige situasie ontwikkel, sal ons onverbiddelik optree sonder aansiens des persoons. Hierdie twee dinge moet besef word want orde en wet moet gehandhaaf word. Ek wil egter aan die agb. lid vir Berea s&#x00EA; dat dit die gesindheid is waarin ons ons werk doen en dit is ook die voorbereiding wat ons in daardie verband doen. Ek is baie dankbaar om te s&#x00EA; dat ons, vanwe&#x00EB; hierdie houding wat ons inneem en as gevolg van die manier waarop ons optree, pragtige dankbetuigings van lede van die publiek kry, uit die Swart-, Kleurlingen Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskappe en ek kan u verseker dat die Kommissaris in die afgelope twee jaar heelwat hiervan ondervind het. Ek kan dus die versekering gee dat ons die vertroue van die publiek in &#x2019;n toenemende mate ook op hierdie terrein geniet in vergelyking met &#x2019;n aantal jare gelede. Ons is almal baie dankbaar dat gemeenskapsleiers en meningsvormers in die gemeenskap met die houding van die Polisie asook ons optrede tevrede is terwyl hulle besef dat indien daar lede in die gemeenskap is wat slae soek, hulle slae sal kry. In daardie wete is hulle tevrede met ons benadering.</p>

<p>Ook op die terrein van misdaadvoorkoming wil ek aan agb. lede&#x2014;en ook aan agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad wat reeds oor hierdie onderwerp gepraat het&#x2014;&#x2019;n prentjie van sukses skets. Trouens, dit is &#x2019;n besondere mooi prentjie wat ek wil skets. Ons besef almal dat misdaad &#x2019;n gemeen-skaps probleem is en dat dit nie net &#x2019;n probleem vir die Polisie is nie. Daar word dus gedurig planne beraam deur die S.A. Polisie om ons en die publiek nader aan mekaar te bring sodat wedersydse vertroue opgebou kan word en sodat die gemeenskap sy rol kan speel om sy besittings te beveilig en om dit nie vir die misdadiger so maklik te maak om &#x2019;n misdaad te pleeg nie. In hierdie verband is daar in die afgelope twee jaar baie gedoen. Ongeveer twee jaar gelede het ons&#x2014;en dit is veral op die speurtak onder bevel van genl. Visser van toepassing&#x2014;begin met &#x2019;n program om misdaadbestryding op &#x2019;n gesonder grondslag te plaas as wat ons dit toentertyd gesien het. In elke afdeling is &#x2019;n senior polisie offisier spesiaal as misdaad-voorkomingsoffisier aangestel. Dit is sy plig om alle misdaadbestrydingsaksies in sy afdeling te beplan en te ko&#x00F6;rdineer. Alle vertakkinge van die Mag word natuurlik hierby betrek. Hy moet &#x2019;n deeglike studie maak van die misdaadpatroon in sy afdeling en van daar moet hy sekere voorkomende stappe neem. Misdaadkonferensies word gereeld gehou op afdelingsvlak, distriksvlak en ook op stasievlak. By ons is dit noodsaaklik dat so gou moontlik nadat &#x2019;n misdaad gepleeg is die besonderhede daarvan onder soveel lede van die Mag se aandag gebring moet word as wat moontlik is. Sodoende kan die hele <span class="col_621-622" refersTo="page_0330"/>Mag, indien moontlik, op die uitkyk vir die besondere misdadigers wees. Daarom is ek baie dankbaar om te kan meld dat daar so baie van ons jonger lede is wat so begeester is dat hulle selfs wanneer hulle van diens af is spesiaal aan diens gaan en help om hierdie sake te ondersoek.</p>

<p>By misdaadkonferensies word soveel instansies as moontlik betrek, byvoorbeeld verkeersafdelings, provinsiale inspekteurs, die Spoorwegpolisie, die S.A. Weermag en enige ander instansie wat volgens die oordeel van die Polisie &#x2019;n bydrae kan lewer. Dit geld byvoorbeeld vir die skakelkomitee waarna die agb. lid vir Hillbrow verwys het. Ek kan die agb. lid vir Hillbrow net kortliks daarop wys dat daardie komitee se pogings tog goeie vrugte afwerp in die gebied van Hillbrow. Daar is nie &#x2019;n besondere toename in misdaad daar nie. Dit beteken egter nie dat die situasie nie ernstig is nie. Dat daar geen besondere toename in misdaad nie, is onder meer ook as gevolg van daardie komitee se bydrae op die skakelgebied.</p>

<p>Polisie-optrede wissel ook na gelang van omstandighede. Nou vra agb. lede dikwels, veral agb. lede aan die oorkant, vir die herinstelling van &#x201E;the bobby on the beat&#x201D;. In die eerste instansie wil ek graag weet waar ons hom moet kry. Ons het net nie genoeg polisiemanne beskikbaar nie. Ons beraam egter planne. Ons huil nie op mekaar se skouers omdat daar so &#x2019;n tekort is nie. Die agb. lid het ges&#x00EA; dat daar op &#x2019;n gegewe dag by die polisiestasie in Hillbrow &#x2019;n tekort van 43&#x0025; was. Dit is waarskynlik korrek. Ek is nie verbaas om dit te hoor nie. Alles in ag genome is dit waarskynlik korrek. Dit beteken egter nie dat daar in die totale sterkte by daardie stasie &#x2019;n tekort van 43&#x0025; is nie. Maar op die gegewe dag was daar &#x2019;n tekort van 43&#x0025; in die normale getal manne aan diens in vergelyking met die totale sterkte van daardie stasie. Ons beraam egter planne.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander aspek is dat die misdadigers ook slimmer geword het. Hulle gaan mos nie &#x2019;n misdaad pleeg voor &#x2019;n polisieman in uniform nie. As hulle egter nie weet dat daar iewers in die straat &#x2019;n polisieman is nie, sal hulle die misdaad pleeg. Die gevolg is dat baie polisiemanne in voorkomingsaksies&#x2014;ek sal later meer daaroor te s&#x00EA; h&#x00EA;&#x2014;in burgerdrag diens doen. Hulle doen dit te voet of in voertuie. Hulle doen dit selfs in groter of kleiner groepies, in burgerdrag of andersins. Ons gebruik ook by geleentheid, veral in die digbevolkte gebiede, studente van die verskillende Polisie-opleidingskolleges om veral oor naweke met voorkomingsaksies te help.</p>

<p>Ten opsigte van die betrekking van die publiek by polisie-aktiwiteite is &#x2019;n verder funksie van die misdaadvoorkomingsofflsiere om by wyse van praatjies aan verskillende groepe voorligting aan die gemeenskap te gee, om materiaal in die vorm van pamflette voor te berei, om uitstallings te re&#x00EB;l, om die nuusmedia oor bepaalde sake in te lig en hul samewerking te verkry, en om die gemeenskap op hierdie gebied meer bewus te maak. Filmmateriaal word gebruik by die voorligtingspraatjies wat gelewer word.</p>

<p>Dan is daar besondere aksies wat ek wil identifiseer. In die afgelope jaar het ons in samewerking met die Raad vir Bejaardes baie gedoen om die senior burgers van ons land in te lig&#x2014;dit is nou nie die agb. lede aan die oorkant nie&#x2014;oor die gevare &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ja, die agb. lid vir Houghton uitgesluit. Daar word baie gedoen om hierdie mense in te lig oor die gevare waaraan hulle in sekere omstandighede blootgestel word en om hulle te oorreed om basiese voorsorgmaatre&#x00EB;ls vir hul eie veiligheid te tref, byvoorbeeld om hul deure te sluit; om vensters wat nie van diefwering voorsien is nie, op knip te hou; om nie sommer &#x2019;n deur vir enigiemand oop te maak nie; om sover moontlik in groepe te stap; om nie aan die einde van die maand wanneer hulle hul pensioen gaan trek, die geld by hulle te hou nie, maar om dit in &#x2019;n spaarrekening te deponeer en so min moontlik geld by hulle te hou. Ons gaan sien die ou mense daaroor. Ons doen voorsorgmaatre&#x00EB;ls aan die hand by wyse van pamflette. Weet u, Meneer, hoe dankbaar die senior burgers is vir hierdie besondere belangstelling aan die kant van die polisie? Ons vergeet ook nie die dames en die kinders nie. Ons is ook besig met &#x2019;n program van voorligting vir dames en kinders. Pamflette en boekmerke word uitgereik waarop ook voorsorgmaatre&#x00EB;ls met betrekking tot hul veiligheid vir hulle uitgespel word. Ons is besig om derduisende van hierdie pamflette met betrekking tot dames en kinders voor te berei vir verspreiding in die nabye toekoms.</p>

<p><span class="col_623-624" refersTo="page_0331"/>Ek wil op &#x2019;n verdere faktor wys waarom ons misdaadvoorkomingsaktiwiteite in Suid-Afrika besonder geslaag is en &#x2019;n vermindering van die misdaadsyfer bewerkstellig het. Ek verwys na die rol wat die nuusmedia in di&#x00E9; verband speel. Danksy die inisiatief wat die polisie aan die dag l&#x00EA;, word as deel van die beplanning oor die afgelope twee jaar waarna ek verwys het, die koerante aangemoedig om gereeld wenke in verband met voorkoming van misdaad te publiseer. Dit word selfs gedoen in koerante wat slegs in &#x2019;n plaaslike gebied beskikbaar is. Dit word deur beide die plattelandse koerante en die nasionale koerante gedoen. &#x2019;n Mens kry dit onder opskrifte soos &#x201E;Wenke vir kinders&#x201D;, &#x201E;Tips to cut crime&#x201D;, &#x201E;Wees voorbereid&#x201D;, &#x201E;Gebruik &#x2019;n loergaatjie&#x201D;, &#x201E;Vermy donker strate&#x201D;, ens. Dan is daar ook byvoorbeeld nog &#x201E;Police file&#x201D;. In &#x2019;n plaaslike koerant in Wes-Transvaal verskyn daar elke week seker drie tot vier van hierdie klein brokkies advies wat dwarsdeur die koerant versprei is. Selfs tussen die advertensies kry &#x2019;n mens die brokkie advies dat as jy op vakansie gaan, jy jou melkbestelling moet kanselleer, ens. Dit alles word daagliks gedoen.</p>

<p>Ons amptelike benadering is om so gou moontlik soveel inligting as moontlik aan die Pers beskikbaar te stel. Die Pers doen baie moeite vir ons in di&#x00E9; verband. &#x2019;n Verskeidenheid van koerante het ook misdaadver-slaggewers wat werklik uit hul pad gaan om so gou moontlik ná ons die inligting aan hulle beskikbaar gestel het, dit in volledige berigte in hul koerante geplaas te kry en om dit in perspektief te stel. Hierdie dinge help ons besonder baie met misdaadvoorkoming. Agb. lede sal in die afgelope paar jaar en veral onlangs opgemerk het hoeveel positiewe berigte in ons koerante verskyn oor die polisie se pogings tot misdaadvoorkoming. &#x2019;n Mens sien omtrent nie meer &#x2019;n negatiewe berig daaroor nie, behalwe wanneer enkele agb. lede oorkant so &#x2019;n bietjie &#x201E;dorp toe&#x201D; gaan. Aan die kant van die koerante kry &#x2019;n mens dit deesdae baie min. Selfs sommige van die munisipaliteite versprei maandeliks misdaadvoorkomingswenke saam met hul wateren ligrekeninge. Dit is mos pragtige vordering wat gemaak is.</p>

<p>Ek wil kortliks &#x2019;n bietjie misdaadstatistiek verstrek ten einde die feit so &#x2019;n bietjie uit te lig dat daar &#x2019;n besondere afname was as &#x2019;n mens kyk na die eerste vier maande van die jare 1979, 1980 en 1981 onderskeidelik. In Januarie 1979 was daar 175 000 misdrywe, in Januarie 1980 148 000 en in Januarie 1981 144 000.</p>

<p>Is that for violent crimes?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, dit is nou misdrywe in groepe A en B. Ons is nou nie besig met die agb. lid se groot probleme van instromingsbeheer en dergelike nie, maar met misdaad. Dit is misdaad waarmee die Speurtak en ander lede van die polisie normaalweg gemoeid is. Dit is nie normaalweg ons taak om oor instroming beheer uit te oefen nie. Dit word ook deur ander mense gedoen. In Februarie 1979 was daar 170 000 misdrywe wat in Februarie 1981 gedaal het tot 141 000. Kom ons kyk na die syfers vir Aprilmaand. In April 1979 was die syfer 185 000. Dit is nou in ronde syfers. In April 1981 was die syfer 128 000. Dit alles is in groot mate te danke aan van die dinge wat ek geskets het, wat gedoen word om die publiek en die polisie saam by misdaadvoorkoming betrokke te kry.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander interessante verskynsel is dat waar ernstige misdaad in die verlede &#x2019;n stygende tendens getoon het, daar terselfdertyd &#x2019;n afname in regsvergrype was, en anders om. Uit die syfers vir die afgelope maande blyk dit egter dat daar nie net &#x2019;n afname in misdrywe was nie, maar ook in regsvergrype. Ondanks die bewering dat misdaad in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika ernstige afmetings aanneem&#x2014;ons word soms voorgehou as &#x2019;n land met van die afskuwelikste misdaadsyfers in die w&#x00EA;reld&#x2014;moet ek darem s&#x00EA; dat die vergelykbare syfers in ander ontwikkelde lande soos die VSA en die Bondsrepubliek van Duitsland interessant is. Oor die afgelope 10 jaar het die VSA &#x2019;n toename in misdade van 38&#x0025; gehad. In die Bondsrepubliek van Duitsland was daar &#x2019;n toename van 47&#x0025;. In die RSA was daar egter &#x2019;n afname van 4&#x0025;. Dit nieteenstaande die feit dat die ander hoogsontwikkelde lande is, lande met ontwikkelde bevolkings. Hierdie vergelykings is gebaseer op &#x2019;n eenheidbevolkingsgroep wat die enigste manier is waarop misdaadsyfers vergelyk kan word. Die prentjie is dus glad nie so donker nie.</p>

<p>Laat my enkele ander syfers aanhaal wat op rekord geplaas behoort te word waar ons <span class="col_625-626" refersTo="page_0332"/>tog met &#x2019;n suksesverhaal te doen het. Ek verstrek hierdie gegewens omdat die agb. lede hul besondere bekommernis met my deel. Ek verwys weer eens na &#x2019;n vergelykende studie, die keer aan die hand van &#x2019;n verslag van die FBI van die VSA. Dit is &#x2019;n vergelykende studie vir die jare 1979-&#x2019;80 en 1980-&#x2019;81. In die geval van roof was daar in 1979-&#x2019;80 in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 20&#x0025; teenoor &#x2019;n toename van 5&#x0025; in Suid-Afrika. Vanjaar was daar &#x2019;n afname van 7&#x0025; in Suid-Afrika. Wat verkragtingsake betref, was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 9&#x0025;, teenoor &#x2019;n toename in Suid-Afrika van 5&#x0025; in 1979-&#x2019;80, en 2&#x0025; vanjaar. In die geval van ernstige aanrandings was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 8&#x0025;, teenoor &#x2019;n toename in Suid-Afrika van 5&#x0025; in 1979-&#x2019;80 en &#x2019;n afname van 4&#x0025; vanjaar. Wat moord betref, was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 7&#x0025; teenoor &#x2019;n toename in Suid-Afrika van 17&#x0025; in die ooreenstemmende jaar en slegs 1&#x0025; vanjaar. Wat huisbraak betref, was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 14&#x0025; teenoor &#x2019;n toename by ons van 1&#x0025; verlede jaar en &#x2019;n afname van 7&#x0025; vanjaar. Dit is te danke aan die publiek se betrokkenheid by die polisie. In die geval van diefstal was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 8&#x0025; teenoor &#x2019;n toename by ons van 5&#x0025; verlede jaar en &#x2019;n afname van 1&#x0025; vanjaar. Wat motordiefstal betref, was daar in die VSA &#x2019;n toename van 26&#x0025; teenoor &#x2019;n toename by ons van 1&#x0025; in 1979-&#x2019;80 en &#x2019;n afname van 0,1&#x0025; vanjaar.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lede oorkant is altyd so bekommerd oor die situasie in Soweto. Soweto word altyd aan die w&#x00EA;reld voorgehou asof dit nou die totale prent van Suid-Afrika is. As die agb. lede die moeite wil doen&#x2014;ek weet hulle sal die moeite doen&#x2014;moet hulle die polisiestasie by Soweto besoek. Die agb. lid vir Soweto &#x2026; [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek bedoel die agb. lid vir Houghton. Sy moet met haar volgende besoek aan Soweto by brigadier Van Eyk gaan tee drink. Ek sal reel dat hy ook koekies beskikbaar het en haar mooi ontvang, wat hy in elk geval altyd doen. Sy moet net daar gaan hoor watter pragtige werk die afdelingskommissaris, senior offisiere en elke lid van die Mag doen om daardie totale gemeenskap van baie meer as een miljoen mense se samewerking te kry. Ongeveer drie weke gelede het die afdelingskommissaris meer as 300 van hierdie Swart, Kleuringen Indi&#x00EB;rleiers en meningsvormers van oor die hele gemeenskap as sy gaste ontvang by sy hoofkwartier, Protea. Hy het ook ander pogings aangewend, maar ek lig net di&#x00E9; een uit. Hy het die Swart polisieorkes daar gehad. Hy het die liggaamopvoedingsvertoongroep van Hammanskraal daar gehad. Hy het die mense ge-&#x201E;wine&#x201D; en ge-&#x201E;dine&#x201D; van &#x2019;n kant af met die beste whisky beskikbaar. Meneer, u moet die kommentaar hoor van daardie meningsvormers, die dankbaarheid wat hulle teenoor ons betuig dat ons op s&#x00F3; &#x2019;n wyse vir mekaar deure oopmaak dat die gemeenskap en die polisie kan saamwerk soos hulle dit wel doen. Ek het ongeveer tien dae gelede ook saam met die kommissaris en ander senior offisiere Soweto besoek. Ek het daar &#x2019;n welwillendheidsbesoek afgel&#x00EA; en drie adjunk-Ministers met my saamgeneem. Ek ken toevallig Soweto taamlik goed. Dit is nie vir my &#x2019;n vreemde plek nie. Ek het gekyk na al die ontwikkeling wat op die gebied van behuising aan die gang is. Ek weet nie hoe <span class="col_627-628" refersTo="page_0333"/>lank gelede die agb. lid vir Berea en die ander agb. lede daar was nie, maar daar vind in Soweto nuwe ontwikkeling plaas by Selection Park, Beverley Hills en elders. Dit is ontwikkeling wat vergelyk met die beste middelklas woonbuurte. Die strate is klaar geteer voordat die huise gebou word. Die infrastruktuur word aangel&#x00EA; voordat die huise gebou word. Die gemiddelde klas huise wat daar gebou word, is huise van tussen R18 000 en meer as R30 000. Dan is daar enkele woonbuurte waar die mense self bou. In Beverley Hills, byvoorbeeld, staan sekere huise van R80 000, R90 000 en R100 000. In elk geval, ons was ook daar as gaste van brigadier Van Eyck. Weer eens was ons daar saam met &#x2019;n groot groep meningsvormers en leiersfigure uit Soweto. Dit was net &#x2019;n welwillendheidsbesoek. Ek maak met groot dankbaarheid melding van hierdie pragtige werk wat nie net in Soweto nie, maar dwars-deur Suid-Afrika gedoen word deur polisieoffisiere en lede van die Mag om meningsvormers van die ander gemeenskappe met ons saam te neem in die bekamping van misdaad en in die hantering van &#x2019;n onrussituasie wat kan ontwikkel. Indien dit uiteindelik &#x2019;n onlussituasie word, sal hulle dit dan ook kan hanteer.</p>

<p>Laat my op Soweto terugkom. In die tydperk van Januarie tot Julie 1981 teenoor die ooreenstemmende tydperk van 1980 was daar in moordgevalle &#x2019;n afname van 15&#x0025;, in roof &#x2019;n afname van 3&#x0025;, in gewapende roof &#x2019;n afname van 11&#x0025;, en in ernstige aanrandings &#x2019;n afname van 8&#x0025;. Dit is maar enkele voorbeelde wat ek uitlig net om vir agb. lede te wys watter vordering daar is in &#x2019;n groot stedelike gebied soos Soweto.</p>

<p>Ek wil vir die agb. lid vir Hillbrow s&#x00EA; dat ek spesiaal ook &#x2019;n bietjie na sy gebied laat kyk het omdat dit &#x2019;n besondere gebied in Johannesburg is. Daar was geen noemens-waardige op-of afwaartse neiging in die misdaadsyfer vir Hillbrow gedurende die afgelope jaar teenoor die vorige jaar nie. Met die beskikbare personeel en die metodes wat aangewend word, word die syfers relatief konstant gehou.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n laaste onderwerp wat ek graag by hierdie geleentheid wil behandel. Dit gaan oor die kwessie van salarisse en diensvoorwaardes. Die agb. lid vir Berea was so onvriendelik om te verwys na die &#x201E;appalling attitude of the Minister&#x201D;. Hy het ges&#x00EA; ek sit en slaap en hy het in sy lewe nog nie so &#x2019;n vrot Minister gesien as wat die Polisie deesdae het nie. Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek gun die agb. lid die byvoeglike naamwoorde wat hy hier wil kwytraak. Dit is vir hom maar net &#x2019;n taaloefening, maar dit is mos nie my skuld dat hy &#x2019;n Rip van Winkel is nie. Dit is mos nie my skuld dat die agb. lid met &#x2019;n klomp ou syfers daar sit nie. Dan staan hy daar ewe gesaghebbend en na aanleiding van &#x2019;n klomp ou syfers voeg hy my &#x2019;n klomp byvoeglike naamwoorde toe. Weet u, Meneer, in die afgelope twee jaar, of minstens in die afgelope jaar&#x2014;laat my hom nie te na kom nie&#x2014; het die agb. lid my nog nie een keer gevra om hom bietjie my l&#x00EA;er te wys of vir hom te s&#x00EA; wat polisiemanne nou werklik kry van konstabel tot generaal nie. Ek sal die gegewens verstrek tot by die Minister as hy dit wil h&#x00EA;.</p>

Hulle stel nie belang nie. Hulle wag tot die Begrotingspos Polisie aan die beurt kom en dan luister hulle gou so hier en daar na &#x2019;n paar storietjies en staan hulle hier jaar na jaar op om dit dan hier te opper. Ongelukkig vir die agb. lid vir Berea het hy hier met &#x2019;n klomp ou syfers gekom en nou verkeer hy in groot verleentheid. Die agb. lid is egter &#x2019;n aangename lid.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek sal vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA;. Wat was my ondervinding oor die afgelope twee jaar as Minister van Polisie? Dit was net &#x2019;n ongelukkige ondervinding. Al die salarisaanpassings verlede jaar en vanjaar is volledig deur ons gepubliseer. Ons het die besonderhede in <i>Servamus</i> gepubliseer wat ons amptelike blad is. Laat my terloops daarna verwys. <i>Servamus</i> is &#x2019;n pragtige blad en die redakteur en sy redaksie het onlangs &#x2019;n besondere toekenning ontvang in die Persw&#x00EA;reld van Suid-Afrika vir hierdie blad van ons. Daarin publiseer ek hierdie soort besonderhede vir die inligting van lede van die Mag. Ek gaan nie in die eerste instansie na die nasionale koerante of ander media om vir polisiemanne te s&#x00EA; wat hul salarisse en diensvoorwaardes is nie. Dit word departementeel deur die kommissaris gedoen en ek as Minister publiseer dit in ons blad en s&#x00EA; dit vir hulle in die openbaar. Dit is ook gedoen. Hierdie jaar nog is dit so laat as Aprilmaand en Meimaand gedoen. Desnieteenstaande het geen enkele agb. lid van die Amptelike Opposisie ooit navraag daaroor gedoen nie. Wat egter vir my so tragies was, was dat behalwe vir &#x2019;n enkele uitsondering ook geen joemaliste belang gestel het om daardie amptelike syfers en besonderhede wat in <i>Servamus</i> gepubliseer word, oor te neem en in hul koerante te publiseer nie. As daar egter iewers &#x2019;n storie met betrekking tot ons salarisse en diensvoorwaardes opgetel word, word daar wel navraag gedoen en word ek vir kommentaar gevra. Dan lewer ek te goeder trou kommentaar daarop aan die joemalis wat my skakel, maar wat dan gebeur, is dat die joernalis die agb. lid vir Berea skakel en ek die volgende dag deur die agb. lid in &#x2019;n koerant beswadder word oor navrae wat aan my gerig is. Dit is mos nie &#x201E;playing the game&#x201D; nie.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek kan die agb. lid voorbeelde gee uit die <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> en ander koerante. Ek het dit net nie by my nie. Die agb. lid weet mos hoe graag hy reageer wanneer die koerante hom bel oor salarisse en diensvoorwaardes. Dan vertel hy mos vir hulle watter vrot Minister die Polisie het. Die agb. lid weet mos. Dan geniet hy dit, maar waar ons nou met mekaar praat, sal hy sy medisyne moet vat.</p>

<p>Ons het die stadium bereik waar ons besluit het om nie langer vir mense kwaad te wees nie. Al wat die S.A. Polisie, die lede van die Mag, nou s&#x00EA;, is dat hulle moeg daarvoor is&#x2014;en hulle het my hulp in di&#x00E9; verband gevra&#x2014;dat hul salarisse en diensvoorwaardes gedurig aan die groot klok gehang word. Daar is nie nog &#x2019;n departement waaroor sulke navrae gedoen word nie. Niemand vra ooit wat die salarisse is in die Departement van Waterwese, die Departement van Gesondheid, Welsyn en Pensioene of ander departemente nie. Hulle wil dit egter altyd van die Polisie weet. Dit het ook in die afgelope jaar die mode geword, ook in die politiek, om altyd van die Polisie se salarisse en diensvoorwaardes &#x2019;n politieke speelbal te maak, veral teen begrotingstyd en voordat die Begrotingspos Polisie hier bespreek word.</p>

<p>Dan word daar uitgebasuin dat die aanvangsalaris van &#x2019;n beampte wat net st. 8 het, die aanvangsalaris is van &#x2019;n konstabel in die Mag en dat dit tragies klein is. Die agb. lid vir Berea voeg egter nie daarby hoe klein die aantal manne is wat met &#x2019;n st. 8 kwalifikasie in diens geneem word teenoor die aantal met &#x2019;n st. 9 kwalifikasie en met &#x2019;n matrieksertifikaat nie. Hy s&#x00EA; nie ook terselfdertyd vir die nuusmedia dat, hoewel dit die aanvangsalaris <span class="col_631-632" refersTo="page_0335"/>is vir &#x2019;n man met &#x2019;n st. 8 kwalifikasie, hulle ook moet kyk na die aanvangsalarisse van manne met &#x2019;n st. 9 kwalifikasie en met &#x2019;n matrieksertifikaat nie. Dit word verswyg. Daar sal ook nie vir die publiek ges&#x00EA; word dat die aanvangsalaris van die man met &#x2019;n st. 9 kwalifikasie of &#x2019;n matrieksertifikaat presies dieselfde is as die aanvangsalaris in die res van die openbare sektor nie. Al hierdie dinge word weggelaat.</p>

<p>Ja, ek kan sien die agb. lid kry swaar. Die agb. lid gaan nog sweet vanmiddag. Daar is ander agb. lede wat ook vir hom sit en wag.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, laat my die besonderhede gee. In die afgelope twee jaar was daar reeds vier salarisverhogings of salarisaan-passings vir die S.A. Polisie. Laat my enkele persentasies gee&#x2014;ek wil nie die skale en dergelike gee nie. In die afgelope twee jaar tot en met die aanpassing van Juliemaand wat reeds in werking is, is die Blanke se beginsalaris gemiddeld met 56,45&#x0025; verhoog en sy maksimumsalaris met &#x2019;n gemiddelde van 36,19&#x0025;; die Indi&#x00EB;rs en Kleurlinge se beginsalarisse is verhoog met &#x2019;n gemiddelde van 51,32&#x0025; en hul maksimumsalarisse met &#x2019;n gemiddelde van 41,42&#x0025;; en die Swarte se beginsalaris is verhoog met &#x2019;n gemiddelde van 59,88&#x0025; en sy maksimumsalaris met &#x2019;n gemiddelde van 43,81&#x0025;.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, is dit nou &#x201E;minimal&#x201D;, is dit nou &#x201E;appalling&#x201D;, en al die ander byvoeglike naamwoorde wat die agb. lid gebruik het?</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Laat my ander voorbedde gee. Die maksimumsalaris van &#x2019;n konstabel is vanaf 1979 tot Juliemaand vanjaar verhoog met R1 320. Ek praat nou net van salarisskale en nie van toelaes en dergelike nie. Die aanpassings tot Juliemaand het juis net betrekking op die range van konstabel tot kolonel. Die agb. lid het die beskuldiging gemaak dat die verhouding tussen die senior en die laer range nie korrek is nie.</p>

<p>Die jongste aanpassings het juis betrekking slegs op die range van konstabel tot kolonel.</p>

<p>Ja, die senior range is nie in die aanpassing van Juliemaand bevoordeel nie. Vanaf die rang van sersant tot by die rang van luitenant-kolonel was daar oor die afgelope twee jaar aanpassings van die maksimumskale van tot R6 345. Dit is nou oor twee jaar. Kan die agb. lid &#x2019;n voorbeeld gee van enige ander organisasie in die openbare sektor wat ten opsigte van die salarisse van sy personeel op soortgelyke syfers kan wys? Ek s&#x00EA; dit met groot dankbaarheid in my hart want &#x2019;n klomp mense het hieraan gewerk. Die Regering het aandag hieraan gegee, asook die Kommissie vir Administrasie, die Tesourie en verskeie agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad. Dit is &#x2019;n groot span mense wat hulle saam met die polisie beywer het om hierdie dinge reg te kry. Ons het salarisskale en vertrekpunte ingestel wat ons in die verlede as onmoontlik sou beskou het.</p>

<p>Praat u nou van die jongste aanpassings?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek praat van die aanpassings tot en met Juliemaand, die aanpassings wat tans in werking is. Die agb. fid het hierdie syfers nie. Dit is syfers wat in werking getree het ná die syfers wat hy daar het. Dit is dus die huidige posisie.</p>

<p>Laat my net &#x2019;n enkele voorbeeld gee. &#x2019;n Luitenant-kolonel se maksimumsalaris was R13 200 en dit is nou in &#x2019;n tydperk van twee jaar verhoog tot R19 545. Dit is dus verhoog met R6 345. Dit is mos &#x2019;n wesenlike verhoging. Daarom kan ek die agb. lid die verse-kering gee dat dit baie, baie beter met die polisie gaan. Ons het pragtige vertrekpunte waarop ons vorentoe tot groot voordeel van al die manne in die Mag kan bou.</p>

<p>Meneer, my tyd is baie beperk. Laat my verder gaan. Ons het vir lede van die Mag diensvoorwaardes aangepas en moontlik gemaak wat na my mening pragtig is. Weet u, Meneer, hoe lank dit voorheen gevat het vir &#x2019;n man om luitenant te word? Daar is oud-lede van die Mag in die Raad en hulle weet. &#x2019;n Goeie man wat sy eksamens geslaag het en bo gemiddelde diens gelewer het, het <span class="col_633-634" refersTo="page_0336"/>met die grootste moeite binne tien jaar offisier geword. Wat is tans die posisie? Nou kan &#x2019;n man met &#x2019;n matrieksertifikaat na vier jaar &#x2019;n offisier in die Polisie wees. Hy kan aan die einde van sy eerste jaar sy eerste eksamen skryf en as hy slaag, kan hy die jaar daarna tot sersant bevorder word. Aan die einde van sy tweede jaar kan hy sy volgende eksamen skryf en in die jaar daarop tot Adjudant-offisier bevorder word. Aan die einde van sy derde jaar kan hy sy nasionale diploma skryf en teen ongeveer die einde van sy vierde jaar, as matrikulant, tot luitenant bevorder word. Tussen vier en vier en &#x2019;n half jaar kan so &#x2019;n man dus mits hy hard werk, &#x2019;n goeie gemiddelde van diens lewer en sy eksamens slaag, tot luitenant bevorder word. Dit is mos &#x2019;n pragtige verandering. Hoekom vra die agb. lid my nie hieroor uit nie. As hy dit wil doen, kan ek hom die gegewens gee en kan hy dit vir die mense in sy kiesafdeling gaan s&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Ons het verlede jaar &#x2019;n stelsel ingevoer om dit vir polisiebeamptes moontlik te maak om polisiemanne te bly. Hoeveel duisende lede van die Mag is daar wat nie die Mag wil verlaat nie, maar om een of ander rede naderhand in &#x2019;n doodlooppaadjie kom wat dit vir hulle nie moontlik maak om langer in die Mag te bly nie? Ook in di&#x00E9; opsig het ons pragtige dinge gedoen om dit vir daardie manne moontlik te maak om te bly. &#x2019;n Term wat ons nou gebruik, is &#x201E;vry bevordering&#x201D;. Dit is &#x2019;n tipe bevordering wat ons verlede jaar in werking gestel het, waar &#x2019;n man byvoorbeeld in sekere omstandighede na sersant of adjudant-offisier bevorder word sonder dat hy sy eksamens geslaag het. Ook op daardie basis kan &#x2019;n man nou na sersant of adjudant-offisier vorder, en al bly hy &#x2019;n adjudant-offisier, gaan sy salarisstruktuur nou deur tot &#x2019;n peil waar dit hom bring na dieselfde vlak as die maksimum vir &#x2019;n kaptein. As hy sy kant bring, behoort hy teen ongeveer 38-jarige ouderdom op die maksimum van &#x2019;n kaptein te wees. Hy is nog &#x2019;n adjudant-offisier, en hy wil in die polisie bly. Hy is &#x2019;n goeie polisieman. Hierdie manne is die steunpilare van die Polisiemag, en ons maak dit vir hulle moontlik om in die polisie te bly.</p>

<p>I am not secretive about this; I shall tell hon. members this any time of the day, if they just want to know it, but they are never interested. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die geval van ons manne wat vir &#x2019;n graad wil studeer, het ons aanpassings gemaak soos hulle in hul graad-studies vorder. Aanpassings word gemaak in hulle eerste, tweede en derde jare, en binne &#x2019;n tydperk van drie jaar kan so &#x2019;n persoon vorder na offisiersrang, na die rang van luitenant. Dit geld ook vir gegradueerdes wat by die Mag aansluit&#x2014;dit is nou in die niefunksionele stroom, byvoorbeeld. Binne &#x2019;n tydperk van drie en &#x2019;n half jaar is so &#x2019;n gegradueerde &#x2019;n offisier. Dit is alles dinge waarvoor ons voorsiening gemaak het.</p>

<p>Daar is nog iets wat ons in die jongste tyd na samesprekings met die Kommissie vir Administrasie kon regkry. As &#x2019;n man nou sy eerstejaar-eksamens slaag vir die Nasionale Sertifikaat, ontvang hy R500 in kontant, as aansporing en beloning vir die harde werk wat hy gelewer het. As hy in sy Nasionale Ho&#x00EB;rsertifikaat slaag&#x2014;dit is in die tweede jaar van sy diploma&#x2014;ontvang hy R750 in kontant. As hy in sy Nasionale Diploma slaag&#x2014;dit is die derde jaar, wat iemand met &#x2019;n matrieksertifikaat toelaat om tot &#x2019;n offisier bevorder te word&#x2014;ontvang hy &#x2019;n kontant-bedrag van R1 000. Dit is voordele wat nou vir die manne geskep is.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Hierdie dinge val nie sommer uit die lug nie. Daar is gepraat van &#x201E;hierdie vrot Minister&#x201D;, maar ek wil aan u s&#x00EA; dat ek en die Kommissaris en ander manne in die Mag nag en dag werk om hierdie voordele te beding, om die samewerking van mense te verkry en om meriete te bepaal. Dan is daar nog iets wat ons reggekry het, en wat baie belangrik is. Dit is &#x2019;n tegniese saak waarop ek nie in besonderhede wil gaan nie, maar dit kom in kort daarop neer dat ons in die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie vir die eerste keer dit reggekry het om vyf posvlakke daar te stel. In die praktyk beteken dit dat alhoewel ons meer range mag h&#x00EA;, &#x2019;n rang nie noodwendig &#x2019;n posvlak is nie. Die mense in ons personeelbestuur praat van posvlakke, en ons het nou vyf <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0337"/>posvlakke verkry wat vergelykbaar is met die res van die openbare sektor. Dit beteken dat, alhoewel daar meer range as posvlakke is, &#x2019;n man nie meer by die maksimum van sy skaal hoef stil te staan omdat daar nie vir hom &#x2019;n bevorderingsmoontlikheid is nie. Ons kan tog nie almal kolonelle maak nie; daar moet tog ook luitenant-kolonels, majoors en ander wees. Ons moet tog &#x2019;n balans behou tussen offisiere en die meer junior manskappe, tot by die konstabel. Nou hoef &#x2019;n man egter nie meer stil te staan wanneer hy aan die einde van &#x2019;n sekere salaris-struktuur kom nie. Hy bly nog steeds in dieselfde rang, maar dan betree hy die salaris-struktuur van die ho&#x00EB;r rang as wat hy is, met die gevolglike finansi&#x00EB;le voordeel. Weet u, Meneer, hoeveel duisende rande dit vir lede van die Mag per jaar sal beteken? Ek dink nie dit is nou nodig dat ek meer besonderhede verskaf nie; ek kan net aan agb. lede die persentasiesyfer noem. Ek het reeds gewys op die maksimum verbetering wat &#x2019;n man op sy salaris oor die afgelope twee jaar gekry het. As ons nou hierdie nuwe stelsel, wat ongeveer tien dae oud is, in werking stel, en dit projekteer oor &#x2019;n tydperk van ses of sewe jaar, soos dit op so &#x2019;n persoon van toepassing sal wees, sal dit beteken dat die maksimum gemiddelde verhoging van 36&#x0025; na 49&#x0025; verhoog sal word. Daarom s&#x00EA; ek aan die agb. lid vir Berea dat daar vandag gelukkigheid in die Polisiemag is. Daar is gelukkigheid by die manne, daar is gelukkigheid by hul vrouens en daar is gelukkigheid by hul kinders &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ja, maar as die hond nie gestop het nie, het hy die haas gevang! [Tussenwerpsels.] Laat my toe om die syfers met betrekking tot nuwe aansoeke deur dames te verstrek. Oor dieselfde tydperk was daar in 1979 19 aansoeke, in 1980 48 en vanjaar reeds 69. En, Meneer, as die agb. lid vir Houghton net een keer in haar lewe in hierdie Pos sal opstaan en van haar kant ook &#x2019;n bydrae sal lewer deur vir die dames van Suid-Afrika te s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Daar is &#x2019;n pragtige Mag, met &#x2019;n pragtige uniform, met pragtige salarisse en aangename werk, wat soms gevaarlik is; ek moedig julle aan om daar aan te sluit,&#x201D; dan sal hierdie syfer ook nog styg.</p>

<p>Ja, Meneer, en ek sal aan die polisiedames gaan s&#x00EA; dat sy haar neus optrek daarvoor.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek wil ook &#x2019;n paar syfers verstrek in verband met aansoeke om herindiensneming. Oor dieselfde tydperke in 1979, 1980 en 1981 was die syfers ten opsigte van Blanke mans 181, 139 en 295. Ek noem hierdie feite om u gerus te stel en om aan te dui dat ons vandag &#x2019;n gelukkige Polisiemag het&#x2014;en agb. lede kan dit vir die manne gaan vra. Daar is baie redes hiervoor, behalwe di&#x00E9; wat ek reeds genoem het. Ek sal enkeles daarvan nader identifiseer.</p>

<p>Een van die redes is die meer positiewe en dinamiese bekendstelling van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie onder andere deur ons Afdeling Openbare Betrekkinge, onder andere deur ons tydskrif <i>Servamus,</i> onder andere deur ons werwingsoffisiere, maar ook deur ons media in die algemeen. Agb. lede kan maar na ons koerante kyk, en na ons media in die algemeen. Ek praat nie van die enkele pap wiele wat ons langs die pad kry as gevolg van &#x2019;n negatiewe berig nie. Ek is dankbaar vir hierdie ondersteuning en vir hierdie mooi projektering van die beeld van die Mag. Maar, Meneer, die belangrikste rede vir hierdie positiewe gees teenoor die Mag is onder andere ook te wyte aan die <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0338"/>algemene suksesvolle optrede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie self, op soveel terreine.</p>

<p>Tesame met die verbeterde salaris-en diensvoorwaardes en die intensiewe werwingsveldtogte is daar dus &#x2019;n totale prent wat ek graag vanmiddag aan die agb. lid vir Berea verskaf, sodat hy meer gemoedsrus kan kry. Ek hoop dat die agb. lid, wanneer hy weer sien dat daar salarisaanpassings of verbeterde diensvoorwaardes aan die kom is, die moeite sal doen om met my te skakel. Ek sal hom dan met plesier daaroor inlig, want ons wil ook graag h&#x00EA; dat hierdie boodskap op &#x2019;n verantwoordelike wyse uitgedra moet word aan die publiek, net soos ons ook ons lede inlig by wyse van die departementele strukture wat daar gestel is ten einde hulle daaroor in te lig.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek dink ek moet in hierdie stadium afsluit, en dan later in die debat verder antwoord en meer besonderhede verstrek oor sake wat deur agb. lede geopper is, soos die sake wat geopper is deur die agb. lid vir Umhlanga en ander agb. lede.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. Minister het voorwaar hierdie gedeelte van sy betoog op &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; noot afgesluit, met die aankondiging oor die salarisse van polisiebeamptes. Ek wens horn hartlik geluk daarmee. Dit is met trots dat ek vandag opstaan om in hierdie Komitee te praat, omdat ek die Minister kan volg nadat hy so &#x2019;n duidelike en deurtastende bewys gelewer het dat hy absoluut baas is van sy porte-feulje, en ook as gevolg van die duidelike uiteensetting wat hy gegee het oor aange-leenthede betreffende die Polisiemag.</p>

<p>Dit is ook met trots dat ek opstaan om te praat as gevolg van die feit dat die polisie in my kiesafdeling gedurende die periode 7 tot 13 Augustus &#x2019;n soektog na &#x2019;n terroristebende afgesluit het. Hulle was geweldig suksesvol, <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0339"/>en alle eer aan die Polisiemag daarvoor, &#x2019;n Padblokkade is opgerig tussen die dorpe Cala en Elliot in verband met &#x2019;n bende wat gesoek is, skynbaar vir die ontploffing van &#x2019;n born in Oos-Londen, maar ook in verband met die moord op twee polisiebeamptes van die Transkei, wat by Butterworth vermoor is. &#x2019;n Motor is gestop, en by die stop van die motor het mense uitgespring. &#x2019;n Skietery het gevolg en in daardie klein skermutseling is twee terroriste doodgeskiet. Een is gevang en twee het weggekom. Twee polisiebeamptes is in hierdie skermutseling gewond. Ek bring graag hulde aan hulle, naamlik aan sersant Theuns Olivier en konstabel Apie van Straaten, van die Elliot-polisie. Die soektog het voortgeduur tot 13 Augustus, toe die ander twee terroriste opgespoor is in die berge tussen Elliot en Barkly-Oos. Daar het een van die polisie-maglede, naamlik sersant Festus Grebe, hom besonder onderskei deur nadat hy in die kop geskiet was, hy op die terroriste aan-gehou skiet het. Die ander twee terroriste is in daardie skermutseling dood. Ek wil ook graag hulde bring aan hom. Hy het pragtig herstel daarna. Ongelukkig het hy &#x2019;n oog verloor, maar ons is bly dat hy alreeds weer in Aliwal-Noord rondbeweeg. Meneer, ek bring hulde aan hierdie drie persone en ek bring hulde aan al die 300 polisiemanne wat aan daardie soektog deelgeneem het, onder baie moeilike omstandighede. Dit is geweldige bergagtige terrein. Alle eer aan die Polisiemag vir die wyse waarop hulle te werk gaan om &#x2019;n persoon aan die man te bring.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag ook as lid van die Aliwal-kiesafdeling dankie s&#x00EA; aan al die persone in die gemeenskappe Barkly-Oos, Elliot, Maclear en Ugie wat tot die hulp van die polisie gekom het. Bystand is op verskillende maniere gelewer. Ek wil besondere hulde aan hulle bring vir &#x2019;n groot taak wat wonderlik afgehandel is deurdat hierdie terroristebende uitgewis is.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander saak wat ek vandag hier aanroer, en dit is die wyse waarop die polisie te werk gaan om misdaad te bekamp. Dit bring my by die onderwerp van veediefstal. Soos u weet, Meneer, grens my kiesafdeling aan twee onafhanklike State, naamlik Transkei en Lesotho. Dit bied &#x2019;n guide geleen-theid vir veediefstal, wat dikwels plaasvind. Veediefstaleenhede word gestig waar en wanneer dit nodig is om die lastige kwessie van veediefstalle te bekamp. Die eenhede is toegerus met al die nodige uitrusting en hulpmiddels om hul taak doeltreffend uit te voer en maak ook by geleenthede gebruik van die Lugmag se helikopters. Op die grense van Lesotho en Transkei word nog van perde gebruik gemaak, terwyl motor-fietse in sommige gevalle ook baie handig te pas kom.</p>

<p>Probleme wat die taak van die polisie bemoeilik is eerstens die talie onbewoonde plase wat aan ons buurstate en Swart gebiede grens, en tweedens die feit dat min vee so gemerk is dat eienaars dit kan uitken. Dit is merkwaardig hoedat eienaars, wanneer hulle veediefstalle rapporteer, eenvoudig s&#x00EA; daar is rooi beeste weg, of bont beeste weg, ens. In hierdie verband sal dit die Polisiemag geweldig help indien boere gebruik maak van geregistreerde oormerke en ander merke. Derdens, Meneer, kom veediefstalle baie voor in moeilik begaanbare gebiede. Indien &#x2019;n diefstal dan eers aangemeld word etlike weke nadat dit plaasgevind het, is dit vir die polisie baie moeilik om die nodige opvolgingswerk te doen. In die afgelope jaar of wat is besondere welslae behaal en is verskeie bendes aangekeer. In etlike gevalle is daar gevind dat Blankes van Swartes gebruik maak om die vee te steel.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag hulde bring aan die veediefstaleenhede in my kiesafdeling, en ek wil graag &#x2019;n paar besonderhede verstrek van die plekke waar hulle gesetel is en hul getalsterktes. Op Barkly-Oos is daar in die vee-diefstaleenheid vyf Blankes en elf Nieblan-ke-lede, op Elliot drie Blankes en drie Nie-blankes, op Ugie vier Blankes en agt Nie-blankes en op Indwe drie Blankes en vier Nieblankes. Verder is daar ook veediefstaleenhede op Queenstown, Stutterheim en Komga, wat aan my kiesafdeling grens. Ek wil in hierdie verband veral verwys na die Barkly-Oos-distrik, wat, soos ek reeds ges&#x00EA; het, aan die twee onafhanklike State van Transkei en Lesotho grens.</p>

<p>Figures collected by the Barkly East Farmers&#x2019; Union show that during the last 12 month period, ending in June 1981, 126 cattle valued at R37 800, 430 sheep valued at R17 200, 4 horses valued at R800 and five donkeys valued at R250 were stolen from 13 farms bordering these independent States. Only two of these farms are abandoned. <span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0340"/>This represents a loss of R50 000 to the Republic of South Africa, as the recovery rate is very low.</p>

<p>The Barkly East Farmers&#x2019; Union feel that assistance by a helicopter from Bloemspruit will certainly help to solve their problems in this connection, and will help in the retrieval of animals lost through stock theft. The topography of the country there is extremely difficult. It is an extremely mountainous area and one has to cope with extremes of climate, with the coldest winters in the country. Then, Sir, there is insufficient manpower to maintain effective patrols&#x2014;although I want to say to the hon. the Minister immediately that we are indeed thankful for those people who are stationed there and who do excellent work, as the figures which I have quoted, show. The police units are also handicapped by time lapses, which used to be at least three days, before the numbers of the police were increased, between the reporting of a theft and the commencement of followup operations. Today we find that within about a day and a half they are on the job, doing excellent tracing work. Furthermore, we suffer from a lack of access and communication in the area of Lesotho bordering the Barkly East district and, in addition, one has to cope with very difficult areas for following spoor, which makes follow-up operations akin to looking for a needle in a haystack. I implore the Minister, if at all possible, to give attention to the possibility of allowing a helicopter to be obtained from Bloemspruit in cases where large stock thefts are reported. This would also give the pilots excellent exercise in manoeuvring their helicopters in those areas which, as I have stated, are very mountainous. If this were done, we would be able to trace the thieves very quickly. I feel that the recovery rate of livestock could be dramatically increased if a helicopter were employed. Within two hours of the police being notified a search could be started from Cairntool station, which is also manned by troopers from Lesotho.</p>

<p>Ek is oortuig daarvan dat diewe op hierdie wyse onmiddellik verhoed kan word om verder te trek. Sodoende kan die patrollies wat van agter inbeweeg ook makliker inkom, om hierdie bendes aan bande te l&#x00EA;. Dit is die pleidooi wat ek vanmiddag aan die agb. Minister rig.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur kortliks melding te maak van &#x2019;n paar polisiestasies in my kiesaf-deling wat nog nie elektriese krag het nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. C. BALLOT</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is besonder aangenaam om die agb. lid vir Aliwal te volg, veral weens die feit dat hy &#x2019;n belangrike saak, naamlik veediefstal, hier geopper het. Dit is &#x2019;n besonder ernstige misdaad, en &#x2019;n mens is dankbaar vir die diens wat die polisie aan die boere en die ander dele van die gemeenskap lewer as gevolg van hierdie misdaad van diefstal.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Minister graag bedank vir die uiteensetting van die posisie ten opsigte van die polisie se salarisse. Ek hoop en vertrou dat die amptelike Opposisie op &#x2019;n meer positiewe wyse daarna sal verwys as wat ons tot dusver van hulle gehoor het.</p>

<p>Dan, Meneer, het die agb. lid vir Hillbrow &#x2019;n interessante gedagte geopper, wat eintlik in hierdie polisiedebat &#x2019;n &#x201E;hardy annual&#x201D; word. Dit is die kwessie van die &#x201E;bobby on the beat&#x201D;. Mnr. die Voorsitter, ons wil almal graag die polisie sien waar hulle in die gemeenskap, op straat en in die openbaar, beweeg, maar ek dink die agb. lid vir Hillbrow sal saamstem met die antwoord wat die agb. Minister gegee het. Vandag het ons gesofistikeerde misdaad, en dit word al hoe moeiliker om misdaad op te los. Derhalwe moet die polisie ook gesofistikeerd optree. Dus kan ons nie meer saamstem met die gedagte van &#x2019;n &#x201E;bobby on the beat&#x201D; in di&#x00E9; sin dat &#x2019;n mens om elke hoek &#x2019;n polisieman in uniform wil sien nie. Ek dink die agb. Minister het dit baie duidelik gestel toe hy gewys het op die manier waarop die polisie hulle taak verrig. &#x2019;n Mens kan maar net kyk na die hoeveelheid misdaad wat gepleeg word en die getalle misdade wat opgelos word. Daardeur besef &#x2019;n mens, selfs al sien jy hulle nie, dat daar nog &#x2019;n sogenaamde &#x201E;bobby on the beat&#x201D; is.</p>

<p>Dit is egter nie net die taak en die plig van die polisie om misdaad te bekamp en te bestry nie. Derhalwe is &#x2019;n mens bly om te verneem dat die gemeenskap, die publiek, meer ingelig word oor misdaad en die voorkoming daarvan. Die agb. Minister het spesifiek verwys na die senior burgers, ou mense wat verkrag en vermoor word. &#x2019;n Mens lees elke dag in die koerante daarvan, &#x2019;n Mens is dus bly dat hierdie mense meer <span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0341"/>kennis gegee word van hoe om misdaad te bestry. &#x2019;n Mens is dankbaar vir wat die polisie doen. &#x2019;n Mens besef dat &#x2019;n oplossing vir die probleem van misdaad nie net by die polisie gesoek moet word nie; die publiek moet self misdaad oplos en voorkom. Derhalwe is dit ook baie belangrik om te kyk na die werksaamhede van die Reserwepolisie.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek glo dat hierdie mense in die Reserwepolisiemag uitmuntende diens lewer. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens dink aan die Reserwepolisiemag, dan vra &#x2019;n mens jouself af: Is dit werklik so &#x2019;n groot opoffering om aan hierdie Mag te behoort? Ek glo dat dit elke persoon wat lief is vir Suid-Afrika se plig is om die Reserwepolisiemag te ondersteun en te onderskraag in die veeleisende taak wat hulle moet verrig. Daar kom tye, veral oor naweke, wanneer die Reserwepolisiemag moet instaan vir die voltydse polisieman. Hierdie Mag word in-gedeel in A-, B-, C-en D-groepe. Dan is daar spesifiek ook verder die SAP-Wachthuisradioreserwe. Ek hoop dat lede van die amptelike Opposisie &#x2019;n besoek aan hierdie SAP-Wachthuisradioreserwe se basis te Pretoria sal bring, om te sien wat hierdie mense doen. Daar is gesofistikeerde apparaat, en hierdie diens word geheel en al op vrywillige grondslag verrig. Bo en behalwe die ander lede van die Reserwepolisiemag verrig hierdie mense uitmuntende diens vir Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander meer gesofistikeerde groep is die duikgroep. Vandag lees &#x2019;n mens so dikwels in die koerante van ligte vliegtuie wat val, hetsy in riviere of elders. Daar het onlangs so &#x2019;n probleem in die Vaaldriehoek ontstaan. Onmiddellik het hierdie duikgroep opgetree, en binne &#x2019;n uur of wat is die betrokke persoon se lyk uit die rivier gehaal. Dit is &#x2019;n lewensgevaarlike taak, maar hierdie mense verrig daardie taak met absolute entoesiasme, nie om hulleself te dien nie, maar om Suid-Afrika te dien.</p>

<p>Meneer, &#x2019;n mens vra jouself dan die vraag af: Kan daar nie meer reserviste wees nie? Laat ons byvoorbeeld na die A-groep kyk. Daar is maar 4 457 aktiewe lede en 3 098 onaktiewe lede. In die B-groep is daar 3 241 aktiewe lede en 3 596 onaktiewe lede. In die C-groep is daar geen aktiewe lede nie en 1 999 onaktiewe lede. In die D-groep is daar 112 aktiewe lede en 109 onaktiewe lede. In die SAPWRR, waarna ek verwys het, is daar 603 aktiewe lede en geen onaktiewe lede nie. Dit is mense hierdie wat kan praat van &#x2019;n uitmuntende rekord. Wat die duikers betref, is daar 188 aktiewe lede en 23 onaktiewe lede. Dit is die syfers wat slegs ten opsigte van die Blankes geld, maar die getalle ten opsigte van die Nieblankes kan ook hier genoem word. &#x2019;n Mens is besonder dankbaar vir die Swartes, die Kleurlinge en die Indi&#x00EB;rs wat hierdie diens aan Suid-Afrika en aan hul gemeenskappe lewer. In die A-groep is daar geen aktiewe of onaktiewe Swart lede nie, maar die getalle ten opsigte van die Kleurlinge is 387 aktiewe lede en 45 onaktiewe lede, terwyl in die geval van die Indi&#x00EB;rs daar 135 aktiewe lede en vyf onaktiewe lede is. In die geval van die Swartes in die B-groep is daar 1 086 aktiewe lede en 416 onaktiewe lede. Onder die Kleurlinge in hierdie groep is daar 769 aktiewe lede en 47 onaktiewe lede, en in die geval van die Indi&#x00EB;rs 245 aktiewe en 38 onaktiewe lede. So kan &#x2019;n mens voortgaan om die syfers aan te haal. &#x2019;n Mens is dankbaar vir die diens wat deur hierdie mense verrig word, maar weer vra &#x2019;n mens, selfs ten opsigte van hierdie geledere: Tree asseblief op in u gemeenskap; help die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie en die Reserwepolisiemag.</p>

<p>Meneer, &#x2019;n mens is dankbaar wanneer jy &#x2019;n berig lees soos die een wat op Woensdag, 19 Augustus, in die <i>Vaderland</i> verskyn het onder die opskrif &#x201E;Polisiehulp kring weier&#x201D;. Ek haal aan uit die berig&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Roodepoort&#x2014;Die Polisiereservistehulp-vereniging wat twee jaar gelede in Rand-burg tot stand gekom het, is besig om wyer uit te kring en talie dorpe het reeds soortgelyke verenigings gestig om die Polisie en Reservistemag by te staan &#x2026; Behalwe Randburg het Alberton, die suide van Johannesburg, Sandton en &#x2019;n paar plattelandse dorpe ook al polisie-hulpverenigings of soortgelykes gestig om die Polisie en die bestaande Reservistemag by te staan.</block>

<p>Dit is hierdie soort optrede en hierdie soort inisiatief wat &#x2019;n mens van &#x2019;n gemeenskap verwag, spesifiek na aanleiding van die gevaarlike tye waarin Suid-Afrika tans verkeer.</p>

<p>Dan, Meneer, wil ek nader kom aan my <span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0342"/>eie kiesafdeling, en meer bepaald die Vaal-driehoek. Daar kan ons getuig van &#x2019;n uitstekende rekord op die gebied van die Re-serwepolisiemag en die aantal lede wat daaraan behoort. Ek het netnou verwys na die aantal aktiewe lede en onaktiewe lede, maar dit is baie belangrik om te let op die aantal ure diens gelewer. Vir die kwartaal ge&#x00EB;indig 31 Maart 1981 het offisiere in die Vaaldrie-hoekgebied 233 ure diens gelewer, die A-groep 1 776 ure, die B-groep 735 ure, die C-groep 386 ure, die duikers 210 ure en Swart lede in die B-groep 310 ure. Die Vaaldrie-hoek is &#x2019;n baie gevaarlike gebied. Vir diegene wat dit nie ken nie: Die polisiedistrik l&#x00EA; in die suide van Transvaal en teen die suidelike grens van die Vaalrivier. Daar is agt polisiestasies in die distrik, naamlik Vander-bijlpark, Vereeniging, Sebokeng (&#x2019;n Swart woongebied met plus/minus 200 000 inwoners), De Deur, Meyerton, Kliprivier, die Barrage en Sharpeville (ook &#x2019;n Swart woongebied). Dit is &#x2019;n groot distrik, maar as &#x2019;n mens na die misdaadsyfers kyk, besef &#x2019;n mens dat die Polisie met hul beperkte mannekrag in daardie gebied uitmuntende diens doen. Graag wil ek dan ook aan elke polisieman in die Vaaldriehoek hulde bring en ook die agb. Minister verseker dat daar werklik &#x2019;n positiewe gesindheid heers tussen ons, die publiek, en die Polisie van die Vaaldriehoek. Na aanleiding van die grootte van hierdie gebied en na aanleiding van die reservistegetal wat ek genoem het, kan ek derhalwe s&#x00EA; dat as &#x2019;n mens die misdaadsyfers in hierdie gebied ontleed&#x2014;ek wil nie die Raad se tyd met &#x2019;n ontleding van die syfers in beslag neem nie&#x2014;&#x2019;n mens sien watter uitstekende werk die mense verrig.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, as ek vandag so kyk na die blom wat die agb. Minister dra en ek dink aan wat hy in die afgelope jaar vir die Polisie gedoen het en as ek sien op watter vernietigende wyse hy vandag die agb. lid vir Berea hier platgeslaan en oor hom geloop het, wil ek vir hom s&#x00EA; hy verdien nie net daardie blommetjie nie, maar inderdaad &#x2019;n groot medalje. Ek wil verder gaan en namens ons almal &#x2019;n baie groot ruiker aan die agb. Minister aanbied. Op di&#x00E9; ruiker staan twee woorde geskrywe. Die twee woorde is: &#x201E;Dankie, Jesse&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag aansny by wat die agb. lid vir Krugersdorp vroe&#x00EB;r ges&#x00EA; het toe hy verwys het na die kwessie van die politisering van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie. Ons was nou die afgelope naweek in die operasionele gebied. Daar was verteenwoordigers van al drie die politieke partye wat in die Parlement ver-teenwoordiging het. Daar bestaan eensge-sindheid by die lede van die verskillende politieke partye oor een onderwerp en dit is dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Weermag nie gepo-litiseer word nie. Nou het die vraag by my ontstaan: Waarom dan nie ook die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie nie?</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is juis my vraag. Dieselfde beginsels geld tog. Daardie polisiemanne veg self ook in die operasionele gebied. Hulle bekamp misdaad. Dit is oor hierdie politisering van die Polisiemag dat ek die agb. lid vir Berea kwalik neem. Hy het vandag hier geposeer as &#x2019;n pleitbesorger vir die Polisie, maar toe die Polisie en die Regering teen mekaar probeer afspeel. Ek wil vir hom s&#x00EA; dat wanneer hy dit doen, hy nie &#x2019;n onskuldige pleitbesorger vir die Polisie is nie, maar wel &#x2019;n wolf in skaapklere.</p>

<p>Sy optrede was blatante politisering van die Polisie. Ek wil vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat dit &#x2019;n skande is en dat die tyd aangebreek het dat die Progressiewe Federale Party&#x2014;ek is seker die Nuwe Republiekparty sal dit wel doen&#x2014; dit sal moet oorweeg om die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie uit die politieke arena te verwyder en, soos in die geval van die Suid-Afrikaanse Weermag, objektief na die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie te kyk soos wat die agb. lid vir Hillbrow vandag in &#x2019;n redelike mate gedoen het.</p>

Minister se bekwaamheid betwyfel. Afgesien daarvan dat die agb. Minister self baie effektief met die agb. lid gehandel het, het die agb. Minister ook sekere vrae aan die lig gebring soos, byvoorbeeld, waarom die PFP nie die syfers wat hulle gesoek het, by hom kom vra het nie. As die agb. lid dit gedoen het, was hy nie vandag so &#x2019;n palooka hier in die Raad nie; dan was hy nie vandag verneder nie. Hy moes net die vrae kom vra het. Ek wil weet waarom hy dit nie gedoen het nie, want die inligting was beskikbaar en die agb. Minister se deure is oop. Ek wil &#x2019;n rede aan die hand doen waarom hy dit nie kom haal het nie.

<p>My ervaring van hierdie agb. Minister is egter &#x2019;n bietjie anders. Die agb. Minister het my kiesafdeling besoek en daar het hy die polisiestasies van Jeppe en Cleveland besoek. Afgesien daarvan dat hy groot begrip, insig en kennis geopenbaar het, het die agb. Minister my en ons polisiemanne ook be&#x00EF;ndruk met die liefde wat hy vir die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie geopenbaar het. Laat ek &#x2019;n voorbeeld noem. Daar was &#x2019;n paar dames wat daar gesit het toe ons daar aangekom het.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Wat toe gebeur het, is dat ons ons gesprek daar gehou het en een van die polisiemanne het toe vir die dames ges&#x00EA; dat hulle moet uitgaan, want die Minister wou met die manne praat. Die agb. Minister het later beswaar gemaak en wou weet waarom die dames nie teenwoordig mag wees nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil s&#x00EA; dat die wyse waarop die agb. Minister die Polisie daardie dag toegespreek het, &#x2019;n besondere indruk gelaat het. Daar was &#x2019;n majoor, &#x2019;n taamlike gryse majoor, wat lankal in die Polisie is. Hy het aandagtig na die agb. Minister sit en luister. Ek kon sien hoe aandagtig hy sit en luister. Na die tyd het hy by my gekom en vir my ges&#x00EA;: Mnr. Van der Merwe, ek wil net vir jou s&#x00EA; hierdie Minister het &#x2019;n ongelooflike kennis van polisie-sake. Die majoor het vir my ges&#x00EA; hy het waardering vir die vreeslose manier waarop die Minister sy saak gestel het en dat hy be&#x00EF;ndruk was met die manier waarop hy sy kennis geopenbaar het. Toe het hy die volgende ges&#x00EA;: Op meriete gaan hierdie Minister die beste Minister van Polisie word wat hierdie land nog ooit gehad het.</p>

<p>As ek nou in die lig daarvan die agb. lid vir Berea se powere aanval moet beoordeel toe hy ges&#x00EA; het dat ons &#x2019;n vrot Minister het, kan ek maar net vir hom s&#x00EA; hy moet weer probeer.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, vervolgens kom ek by die eintlike tema van my toespraak, naamlik die vrou van die polisieman. Ek wil vandag graag &#x2019;n lansie breek vir hierdie stille heldinne. Het agb. lede al ooit gedink waaraan &#x2019;n vrou haar blootstel as sy met &#x2019;n polisieman in die huwelik tree? In die eerste plek stel sy haar bloot aan &#x2019;n man wat 24 uur van die dag en 365 dae van die jaar aan diens is. Hy het geen bepaalde werksure nie. Sy stel haar bloot aan &#x2019;n man wat vir haar s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Expect me when you see me.&#x201D; Sy stel haar bloot aan die feit dat sy &#x2019;n man gaan h&#x00EA; wat permanent in lewensgevaar gaan verkeer, en potensieel vermink kan word. Sy stel haar bloot aan verplasings en baie ander ongerief. Ek wil graag vir daardie vroue &#x2019;n lansie breek en vir die agb. Minister vra of hy tevrede is dat daar genoeg gesorg word vir die vrou van die polisieman? Is die agb. Minister tevrede dat daar voldoende omgesien word na so &#x2019;n vrou se voordele soos, byvoorbeeld, pensioenvoordele vir haarself en vir haar kinders in die geval waar sy &#x2019;n weduwee word? Ek sal graag &#x2019;n versekering van die agb. Minister wil h&#x00EA; dat dit die geval is.</p>

<p><span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0344"/>Dan wil ek vandag ook dankie s&#x00EA;. In hierdie tyd s&#x00EA; ons nie genoeg dankie vir mekaar nie. Ons aanvaar soveel as vanselfsprekend. Ek dink ons het groot sondaars geword wanneer dit by die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie kom, want, soos die Engelsman s&#x00EA;, &#x201E;we are taking everything for granted.&#x201D; Daarom wil ek graag vandag dankie s&#x00EA;. Ek wil dankie s&#x00EA; aan die vrou van die polisieman omdat hulle lief is vir ons polisiemanne, dat hulle bereid is om onder hierdie omstandighede &#x2019;n huwelik met &#x2019;n polisieman te sluit; dat hulle bereid is om daardie baie lang eensame ure sonder hulle mans te verduur. Ek wil vir die vrou van die polisieman dankie s&#x00EA; vir die verduring van die vrees en die onsekerheid wat verbonde is aan die gevaarlike werk wat haar man doen. Ek wil dankie s&#x00EA; vir die polisieman se vrou vir die krag wat sy aan ons polisiemanne gee, vir die ondersteuning, die liefde en die geestelike bystand wat sy aan ons polisiemanne gee. Ek wil vir haar s&#x00EA; sonder haar, die polisieman se vrou, sou Suid-Afrika nie &#x2019;n veilige plek gewees het nie.</p>

<p>Wat betref die draers van die blou uniform, ons polisiemanne self, wil ek ten slotte dankie s&#x00EA; aan die onbekende konstabel, nie die generaal of die sersant of wie ook al nie, maar die onbekende polisieman. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; vir &#x2019;n veilige Suid-Afrika waarin ons almal rustig kan slaap. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; dat hy bereid is om 24 uur van die dag te werk. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; dat hy saam met sy maats &#x2019;n afskrikmiddel teen ons vyand vorm. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; vir die eensaamheid en soms gevaarlike nagte wat hy trotseer om oor ons te waak. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; vir die opera-sionele diens wat hy verrig. Dankie vir die geduld waarmee hy die oplossing van sy beroepsprobleme en salarisprobleme afge-wag het. Ek wil vir hom dankie s&#x00EA; dat hy lief is vir Suid-Afrika. Ek wil afsluit deur te s&#x00EA; Suid-Afrika kan nie sonder die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie bestaan nie.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the hon. member asked why we in this party cannot work together with them and depoliticize the Police Force or our attitude towards the Police Force, as we have done with the Defence Force. Although that is not quite correct, I ought perhaps to deal briefly with the reasons for our attitude as far as the Police Force is concerned. It is a far more sensitive and far more controversial aspect of our community than the Defence Force which to a large extent deals with Foreign Affairs and external aggressions. The Police Force, unfortunately for the hon. the Minister and for the individual policeman, has to deal with the implementation of political ideologies.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the nature of Police activities requires the critical attention of any political party and particularly that of the official Opposition Party in South Africa. The hon. the Minister has today, for example, referred to Bishop Tutu. Allegations were made about utterances and activities of Bishop Tutu. That in itself is immediately an aspect which is in the centre, in the core of South African political problems. Quite clearly, if the hon. the Minister has evidence available which can stand the test of our courts, and which shows that an offence has been committed, that a crime has been committed, then it is his function to investigate and take the matter further and to bring to the courts for prosecution whoever has committed the crime. The Police and the individual policeman unfortunately find themselves in the frontline <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0345"/>of our political tensions, of our political problems in South Africa. They are not the ones who will eventually be able to solve political problems, just as little as, for example, the hon. the Minister of Police will be able to solve our problems if individual agitators are removed. The real cause of our probleem is a political one. It would be far easier for the policeman to secure a peaceful society if the underlying root causes that gave the agitators ammunition within their groups, were removed. If the promises which have been made or the aspirations which have been placed on the horizon are fulfilled by politicians and the Government keeps to its words, then the Police will have an easier task. But, I do not wish to deal with the allegations about Bishop Tutu because this is the first time that I have heard about them today. I have no further knowledge about them.</p>

<p>I wish to deal very briefly with the constituency I represent, namely Durban Central, because there is an aspect which is peculiar to that constituency. We all know that the incidence of bomb explosions has increased over the last year. Durban Central and the City of Durban have had the same probleem. In fact, three bombs have exploded in the City of Durban during the last three months. There are two aspects to it. We know that this is likely to increase generally in South Africa, but in Durban the businessmen and the residents are concerned about two aspects. Firstly, is there any particular reason why Durban itself is the main target. Has the hon. the Minister information which suggests that for some reason an attack on Durban is more likely than an attack on other centres and that we are, therefore, likely to have more of these incidents in the near future?</p>

<p>In South Africa every city area is a target.</p>

<speech by="#gastrow">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. H. P. GASTROW</person>:</from>

<p>The second aspect is whether the hon. the Minister through his department has taken any special steps in conjunction with local authorities, in conjunction with local organizations, to minimize the possibility of these explosions taking place. One appreciates the difficulty involved in that. One appreciates that the Police on its own will never be able to give any guarantees. The assistance of civilians is essential if the risks is to be reduced. However, the people of this area would like to know whether the Police are thinking of further measures to reduce the risk of this happening in areas like the centre of Durban.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given us a detailed report in a speech which had many positive aspects to it. He has mentioned that the Riot Squad or the section of the Police Force which deals with the very difficult probleem of controlling crowds and riots, is very well trained, that they are doing their best and that in the view of the public at large they are seen in a positive way. I cannot deny that that may be the majority view amongst us in the White community. However, one has to look it in the face and realize that there are still many, many aspects of the activities of that particular group of the Police Force which need to be ironed out, which need to be looked at. One merely has to look at news reports, even if one looks at them critically, over the last nine months to see how many reports come up about unnecessary force, about unnecessary brutality. According to many of those reports there appears to be an over-reliance on the &#x201C;sterkman-beeld&#x201D;, the &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister has mentioned&#x2014;and I accept it&#x2014;that without a strong arm the Police will not be able to fulfil its functions properly. However, it seems that in many cases, for example, in the Coloured townships in Johannesburg, with the school problems in Paarl, and with trade union unrest, i.e., particularly in cases where non-Whites are concerned, the emphasis on the strong arm image, on the &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;, is far more than it should be. One looks at an article published in <i>The Sowetan</i> in June this year, merely to indicate the reaction of some Coloured leaders to the unrest on the Reef. The hon. the Minister is fully aware of it. I am merely quoting it &#x2026;</p>

<p>May I just read from it because it provides easy reference. Prof. Olivier is doing his job very well. This <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0346"/>report appeared in <i>The Sowetan</i> of 22 June 1981. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a matter of distress that in the Coloured community the image of the Police is changing, Minister of Police, Louis le Grange heard last week. A delegation of eight men went to see the Minister of Police to tell him that in the eyes of the Coloured community these, as they saw it, strong-arm tactics, brutal methods which were used, had changed their view of the Police to one of hostility, one of distrust.</block>

<p>I am making this point on the level that one should remain conscious of the fact that particularly when you are dealing with the other races a greater sensitivity to the situation should be shown. The fact that the officers have been trained overseas is a positive aspect, but it is necessary to train them further and to take into account the various racial problems that we have here, the various political problems that we have here, in order to qualify these people.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">Z. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened to the hon. member for Durban Central and it appears that the Progressive Federal Party is not prepared to keep the Police Force out of politics. I think that is the message that came through loud and clear. My colleague, the hon. member for Jeppe, specifically asked the question and we can now be sure that politics will be brought into Police Force actions whenever it is possible. The hon. the Minister referred, if I remember correctly, to Bishop Tutu in his personal capacity as Minister of Police. I do not think he coupled any action of the South African Police to the words of Bishop Tutu whom he quoted. The hon. member is correct when he says that this is perhaps at the core of the probleem in South Africa. However, that is the perception that that party has. The hon. the Minister clearly read out what Bishop Tutu said. That hon. member was not prepared to dissociate himself from the words of Bishop Tutu. I can only say there is a certain naivety on that side of the House if they think that we can expect anything but propoganda against the police. For instance, it is obvious that the terrorists and other people will accuse the police of brutal tactics; it is obvious that they will accuse them of strong-arm tactics.</p>

He declares openly that he sides with them. He shows solidarity with them. I am surprised that hon. members on that side do not take Bishop Tutu to task. It does not concern the NP, it concerns the African National Congress, it concerns the Communist Party. I am surprised. I repeat that I think the PFP is absolutely soft on security.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, as daardie agb. lid nie so &#x201E;horrible&#x201D; was nie, kon ek hom dalk geantwoord het.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag voortgaan met my toespraak en my gelukwense by di&#x00E9; van die agb. lid vir Verwoerdburg voeg aan genl. Johan Coetzee met sy bevordering.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook h&#x00EA; dat ons moet kyk na &#x2019;n perspektief van &#x2019;n polisiewerk wat ek graag wil belig. In die eerste plek moet ons besef dat polisiewerksaamhede nie net die ondersoek na en voorkoming van misdade behels nie. Dit is &#x2019;n suiwer polisiefunksie, maar nie al een nie. Dit behels ook die bewaring van binnelandse veiligheid en die handhawing van wet en orde. Hierdie is &#x2019;n semi-milit&#x00EA;re polisiefunksie. Wanneer ons kyk na artikel 7 van die Polisiewet, No. 7 van 1958, sien ons die Staatpresident kan in die geval van oorlog of ander noodtoestand, die Mag of enige deel daarvan gebruik om in verband met die verdediging van die Republiek te dien. Ek gaan nie verder as dit nie. Met ander <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0347"/>woorde, hier is &#x2019;n suiwer milit&#x00EA;re funksie wat die S.A. Polisie moet vervul. Maar ons moet na die S.A. Polisie ook kyk as, soos dit in hierdie artikel beskryf word, &#x2019;n Mag. Dit is bedoel om &#x2019;n Mag te wees. Dit is nie &#x2019;n diens nie. Dit is &#x2019;n Mag, &#x2019;n Mag van die Staat, om veiligheid, wet en orde te handhaaf. Die beeld van die S.A. Polisie, soos ek dit sien, is daardie man wat met die agtpuntige ster voor sy kop tussen reg en onreg, veiligheid en onsekuriteit, wet en orde en anargie, staan.</p>

<p>Die beeld van die S.A. Polisie moet ons nie verwar nie, alhoewel hul leuse miskien <i>servamus</i> is. <i>Servamus,</i> vryelik vertaal, beteken &#x201E;Ons is besig om te dien&#x201D;. Ons moet baie versigtig wees dat ons die polisie nie sien as &#x2019;n mag wat as knegte dien nie. Die polisie dien nie as huurlinge nie, die polisie dien as gedelegeerdes van die Staat met die volmag van die Staat en tree op as agente van die Staat om die veiligheid, wet en orde te handhaaf. Dit is tyd dat ons die beeld van die polisie as agente, as gedelegeerdes met volmag om die veiligheid van die Staat te handhaaf, in perspektief kry. Hierdie leuse <i>servamus,</i> &#x201E;ons is besig om te dien&#x201D;, is &#x2019;n baie goeie leuse. Hulle s&#x00EA; nie waar hulle besig is om te dien nie. Hulle dien oral waar dit nodig is. Die polisie dien oral. Kom ons kyk net na hul geskiedenis. In 1912 is daar begin met die Polisiewet en in 1913 is dit in werking gestel. Aangesien die tyd baie min is, wil ek daarvandaan vlugtig beweeg na die Tweede W&#x00EA;reldoorlog. In die Tweede W&#x00EA;reldoorlog was daar &#x2019;n polisiebrigade. &#x2019;n Polisiebrigade is op die been gebring en hulle is oorsee. Hulle het die belange van Suid-Afrika, soos die Regering dit bepaal het, selfs oorsee gaan dien. Dit is dus nie &#x2019;n nuwe konsep dat die polisie buite die landsgrense dien nie. Dit is ook interessant om te weet dat daardie brigade bestaan het uit &#x2019;n motorfietskompanje en &#x2019;n pantserkar-kompanje onder bevel van brig. Cooper. Ek wil dit die polisie ter ere nagee dat hulle nie hul mense vergeet nie. As jy in die polisie is, is jy een van hulle en bly jy een van hulle. So het dit dan ook twee jaar gelede gebeur dat brig. Cooper die rang van genl.-majoor gekry het, wat &#x2019;n erkenning was dat hy een van die polisie is. Vandag leef hy nog. Hy is die oudste oorlewende lid van die Polisiemag, 91 jaar oud. Hy boer by Tzaneen. Dit sal miskien vanpas wees as die Kommissaris van Polisie net &#x2019;n briefie aan hom sal skryf en aan hom s&#x00EA; dat sy naam met erkenning in hierdie Komitee genoem is.</p>

<p>Nou wil ek kyk na die verslag van die Kommissaris van Polisie. Op bladsy 1 staan daar die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die aanslag teen die gevestigde gesag in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika is beklemtoon deur die gewapende terroriste-aanval op die polisiestasie van Orlando &#x2026;</block>

<p>Hier is dit duidelik: &#x2019;n Aanslag teen die gevestigde mag. Die polisie het hierdie aanslag sien kom. Die polisie het besef hier kom &#x2019;n aanslag en in 1966 reeds het hulle te Maleoskop begin met opleiding in onlusbe-heer en teeninsurgensie. In die afgelope boekjaar waarna in hierdie verslag verwys word, is daar ongeveer 900 mense aldaar opgelei.</p>

<p>Weer eens wil ek bevestig dat die polisie oral dien. Ons dink aan die Caprivi; ons dink aan Rhodesi&#x00EB;; ons dink aan Ovamboland; ons dink aan Suidwes en ons dink aan Suid-Afrika. Die polisie se dienste vir hierdie land en volk l&#x00EA; die hele w&#x00EA;reld vol, as ek dit so mag stel. Buite sy grense en binne sy grense. Die verliese was daar ook.</p>

<p>Vir hierdie belangrike taak wat die polisie uitvoer, het hulle manne nodig wat aansluit by die Mag. Vandag het die agb. Minister hier geblom, letterlik en figuurlik, toe hy met entoesiasme gepraat het van die polisie. As ek kyk na die polisiemanne wat vandag hier sit en di&#x00E9; wat vanmiddag in die galery gesit het, sien ek dat hulle ook blom. Hulle is &#x2019;n Mag, netjies, trots en bewus van hulle eie waardigheid. Wanneer ek dus in die verslag lees dat daar naasteby 500 dienspligtiges per jaar, indien dit moontlik is, aan die polisie toeges&#x00EA; kan word, wil ek s&#x00EA; dit is goed dat daar mense kom, maar ek sou verwag dat met so &#x2019;n voortreflike Mag met so &#x2019;n voortreflike geskiedenis, mense sal kom en vrywilliglik sal aansluit. Ek kan nie dink waar &#x2019;n persoon hierdie volk van ons beter kan dien as juis in die Polisiemag nie, want polisiediens strek oor die hele spektrum&#x2014; polisiediens, semi-milit&#x00EA;re polisiediens en milit&#x00EA;re diens. Dit is mos &#x2019;n uitdaging vir &#x2019;n jong man.</p>

<p>Soos ons kon verwag het, het ons vandag ook die polisie in die operasionele gebied. Ons wil vir hulle dankie s&#x00EA; vir dit wat hulle <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_0348"/>daar doen. Die agb. Minister het volledig uitgebrei oor wat die polisiemanne daar doen. Ek wil nie verder daaroor uitwei nie. Ons spreek ons dank en waardering uit teenoor die Polisiemag en hul families. Dit het hierdie kant van die Raad gedoen en ons sal aanhou om dit te doen want ons waardeer ons polisie. Die polisiemanne moet verstaan dat ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad aan hulle kant is. Ons glo dat alle inwoners van hierdie Republiek die veiligheid en die vrede en die orde met vertroue in hulle hande sal laat. Hulle gee ons die tyd wat ons benodig om die binnelandse politieke situasie op te los. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, it will not be too long after eight. However, there are still members on this side who should like to address the Committee.</p>

<p>Ek dink nie daar is meer veel aspekte van die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Berea waarop ek nog nie gereageer het nie. Die agb. lid het my ook gevra oor die jongste ooreen-koms tussen die Kommissaris van Polisie en die Nasionale Persunie en wat in daardie verband beoog word, of die algemene strekking daarvan. Om agb. lede behulp-saam te wees wat betref tyd, gaan ek nie nou in besonderhede daarop in nie, maar s&#x00EA; net dat &#x2019;n ooreenkoms wel tussen die Kommissaris van Polisie en die Nasionale Persunie gesluit is tot bevrediging van albei kante. Dit is &#x2019;n konsensusooreenkoms. Ek het insae in die ooreenkoms gehad en is dus bewus van die bepalings daarvan. Daar is aan albei kante gepoog om mekaar te ontmoet in verband met daardie ooreenkoms. Ek dink daar is &#x2019;n werkbare basis geskep en ons moet nou maar vorentoe van albei kante ons bes probeer om mekaar te akkommodeer. Sover die ooreenkoms betref, moet ek aan agb. lede s&#x00EA; dat dit &#x2019;n kwessie van gesindheid is. As ons vorentoe in die regte gesindheid teenoor mekaar optree en mekaar in &#x2019;n krisissituasie probeer akkommodeer, sal ons wel vir mekaar &#x2019;n geskikte antwoord kan gee, maar as ons nou terugval op die ooreenkoms, sal dit maar gaan soos met baie ooreenkomste. As ons werklik daarop wil steun, sal ons meer probleme as iets anders h&#x00EA;. Ek is dankbaar vir die moeite wat die Kommissaris gedoen het. Ek is ook dankbaar vir die moeite wat die Nasionale Persunie gedoen het. Dit is in daardie gees dat die Kommissaris en die Nasionale Persunie hierdie ooreenkoms gesluit het. Ek s&#x00EA; ons moet die saak nou &#x2019;n kans gee. Ek het alle rede om te glo ons gaan vorentoe hartlik saamwerk.</p>

<p>Na aanleiding van die opleiding van Swart lede wat nou verkort is van 26 weke na 11 weke, waarna die agb. lid vir Berea verwys het, wil ek net s&#x00EA; dat dit suiwer &#x2019;n tydelike re&#x00EB;ling is omdat ons &#x2019;n opdamming van Swart lede by polisiestasies het wat al &#x2019;n jaar en langer in diens opgelei word omdat ons nie genoeg akkommodasie by Ham-manskraal het om hulle op te lei nie. Ons kan nie langer so aangaan nie.</p>

<p>Some of these members of the force have been serving for more than a year and have not attended a training college yet.</p>

<p>Baie van hierdie lede is alreeds so goed in diens opgelei dat hulle nie meer &#x2019;n ses-maande-opleiding nodig het nie. Agb. lede moet besef dat in &#x2019;n ses-maande-opleiding baie tyd bestee word aan, bv. parades, lig-gaamsopvoeding en al die ander soort ekstra goed. Daardie dinge gaan nou ingeperk word. Dus ly die werklike polisie-opleiding geen skade nie. Sy klaskamerwerk, sy polisiewerk en die eksamens wat hy moet skryf, is presies dieselfde as in die geval van &#x2019;n ses-maande-kursus. Die re&#x00EB;ling sal geld totdat ons hierdie agterstand afgewerk het. Dan gaan ons weer terug na die ou stelsel, maar dan gaan ons waarskynlik ook &#x2019;n stap vorentoe en die manne sal dan ook &#x2019;n jaar lank opgelei word soos wat ons vanaf volgende <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0349"/>jaar die Blanke lede gaan oplei. Ek sal later in die debat daarby kom.</p>

Ons voorsien ook om die stelsel vorentoe ook vir ons Swart lede en ander lede in werking te stel. Dit is al rede waarom die opleidingstydperk vir Swart lede tans 11 weke is en nie 26 nie. Ek dink hiermee het ek die agb. lid grotendeels geantwoord. Oor die ander sake wat die agb. lid geopper het, het ek hom netnou baie volledig geadviseer.</p>

<p>Daar is nog een saak waarop ek netnou in meer besonderhede kan antwoord, maar wat ek nou net kortliks wil behandel.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to a representative body or a staff association for members. I am not in favour of that. We are not in favour of having a staff association or some &#x201C;vakbond-aff&#x00EA;re&#x201D; in the Force.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek sal vir die agb. lid die redes daarvoor gee. Daar is twee belangrike redes daarvoor.</p>

<p>Die een is dat kragtens die polisie se huidige Staande Orders daar geen probleme is met die kommunikasielyne beskikbaar vir &#x2019;n lid van die mag, van onder tot bo uit, nie. Ek kan vir agb. lede besonderhede gee. Laat my net een voorbeeld noem. Daar was in die afgelope jaar bv. 134 of 135 app&#x00E9;lle. Onder sekere omstandighede kan die manne appelleer tot by die Minister. Die grootste sorg word gedra dat daar regtig nie &#x2019;n man langs die pad benadeel word nie. Hy kan van een hoof na die ander en tot by die Minister gaan en hy word nie benadeel nie. Ek weet waarvan ek praat, want ek het sulke voor-beelde op my tafel gehad van manne wat tot by my geappelleer het nadat hulle by die Kommissaris was en nie reggekom het nie. Die regte kanale is gevolg tot by my. Ons verwyt nie daardie man nie, want dit is sy goeie reg as polisieman om die gewone kanale tot bo te volg. Maar wat het ons nou gedoen? Ek noem dit net kortliks. Ons het &#x2019;n omvattende interne kyk na onsself geneem, as ek dit so mag stel. Een van die resultate daarvan is dat ons nou &#x2019;n beplan-nings-en adviesliggaam daar gestel het wat reeds in werking is en waarvan die voorsitter &#x2019;n generaal-majoor is met drie senior briga-diere en &#x2019;n kolonel en &#x2019;n luitenant-kolonel saam met hom. Daardie manne is losgemaak van alle ander take en het nou hierdie nuwe voltydse taak as &#x2019;n beplannings-en adviesko-mitee vir die Minister en die Kommissaris. Hulle moet alle opdragte wat deur die Minister of deur die Kommissaris na hulle verwys word, aandag aan gee en dan terugkom by wyse van &#x2019;n verslag. Daar is nie &#x2019;n aktiwiteit in die Polisiedepartement wat nie deur hierdie beplannings-en advieskomitee in oor-weging geneem sal word nie. Hulle is top deskundiges op hulle vakterrein. Hulle is ervare offisiere. Sommige van hulle is akademies goed gekwalifiseerd in die rigting waarin hulle hierdie ondersoeke sal moet onderneem. Ek is baie gelukkig dat ons na onsself gekyk het en vir onsself &#x2019;n beplannings-en advieskomitee, &#x2019;n adviesraad, daargestel het wat direk aan die Minister en die Kommissaris verslag moet doen van die uitvoering van hul opdrag wat hulle van die Minister of die Kommissaris kry. Een van die aange-leenthede waarna hulle moet kyk, is natuurlik personeelaangeleenthede. As daar enige kommunikasieprobleme vir lede van die mag is, sal daardie beplannings-en advieskomitee daadwerklik daaraan aandag gee en met advies terugkom na die Kommissaris en na my. Ek wil nie vergelykings tref nie, maar ek dink daar is min ander polisiemagte of departemente wat so &#x2019;n pragtige liggaam daargestel het as wat ons tot voordeel van die lede van die Mag daargestel het.</p>

<p>I think with that I have answered all the relevant questions of the hon. member for Berea and the relevant aspects of his speech.</p>

<p>I should now like to refer to one or two aspects mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. member was kind enough to let me have a photo-copy of the relevant pages of the particular report by the Maisels Commission. The hon. member made one or two points in respect of which I cannot agree with her, because what she said is not what is in this report. She said that these standing orders and/or conditions on the particular warrant are post-Biko. That is not so. It is not post-Biko.</p>

<p>The other point I should like to make is that it is not for the head of the Security Police as such to decide to which hospital or institution a person must be referred.

<p>There is a great difference between Head Office giving instructions in the final instance and what is standing here. I just wanted to clear this up. That is not what happens in practice. Let me give an example of what happens in practice.</p>

<p>Post-Biko, pre-Biko, I do not mind which side of Biko it was. I am giving an example which happened lately and which shows the approach of the police over the years. We had a detainee in Cape Town lately who went on a fast.</p>

<p>Naidoo.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Naidoo. Eventually we had to decide whether he had to go to hospital. Of course, I contacted the Commissioner and the head of Security. But what did we do? We just decided in the normal course of events that the doctor should decide. We would be led by the decision of the doctor. We told the doctor, who is a well-known specialist in Cape Town, that we had a probleem on our hands, that he had to advise us and that we would follow his advice. We told him that if he said we should send him to Pollsmoor Hospital we would send him there; if he told us that he had to go to Groote Schuur, we would send him to Groote Schuur. The doctor advised us to which hospital this detainee had to be sent and we did just that. That is what we do in practice, may I put the hon. member&#x2019;s mind at rest.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member&#x2019;s question whether we will consider to have this enforced by way of general law, I can tell the hon. member that we are not prepared to consider that. The hon. member must accept that the Commissioner and I only had a brief discussion, but at this stage we are not prepared to consider it. However, we will look into this matter. I want to stress that we <span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0351"/>were in no way involved as far as this Commission is concerned. We were not consulted. We knew nothing about it except what we read in the press and except for one request that these two commissioners be allowed to visit the police cells in Port Elizabeth where Biko was kept for a short time. The request was refused by the police officer in charge and his decision was confirmed by the Commissioner of Police. I agreed with this confirmation of the police officer&#x2019;s action.</p>

<p>Nee wag, gee my &#x2019;n kans. Daar is nog net &#x2019;n minuut oor.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central asked me whether Durban as such could be regarded as a target. Of course, every city in South Africa is a potential target. The hon. member also asked me whether we had taken steps in conjunction with local authorities to minimize the chances of such attacks? Well, in all the local authority areas in South Africa we have what is known as a civil defence system as well as other systems in practise. Although that is the case, it is of course no particular guarantee. However, we are involved in those particular systems as applied in all the different local authorities. I do not think we can do much more than that at this stage.</p>

<p>As &#x2019;n laaste gedagte wil ek s&#x00EA; die motivering van die agb. lid om te s&#x00EA; dat die optrede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie in die Kleurlinggebiede van Johannesburg die mense van daardie gebiede se houding teenoor die polisie verander, kan ek nie begryp nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ja, die storie het in die koerant verskyn, maar ons het met die mense gepraat. Van daardie gemeen-skapleiers was by my op kantoor. Predikante, onderwysers en politieke leiers was by my op kantoor en nie een van hulle is &#x2019;n ondersteuner van die Regering nie. Nogtans het ons &#x2019;n vrugbare gesprek gehad. Die <i>rapport</i> wat ek later uit daardie Kleurlinggebiede gekry het, is glad nie so ongunstig nie. In-teendeel, nou dat daar rustigheid gekom het, kom sommige van die werklike feite ook na vore.

Moontlik sal die agb. lid nog later haar opdaging maak. Intussen stel ek dus graag &#x2019;n vraag aan die agb. Minister oor my kiesafdeling.</p>

<p>In my kiesafdeling is daar die Booysens-polisiestasie wat &#x2019;n groot gebied dek. Binne <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0353"/>hierdie gebied l&#x00EA; daar ook &#x2019;n landdroshof. Ons het probleme daar as gevolg van die feit dat daar nie vir die getuies en ander persone wat die hof besoek genoeg sitplekke beskikbaar is nie. Die agb.

<p>Ek het John Vor-ster-plein in my kiesafdeling, en enige ou wat nou nog wil praat, kan maar aangaan. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek dink die agitasie en onluste deur anderskleuriges in hierdie land het van John Vorster-plein een van die bekendste polisiestasies in die w&#x00EA;reld gemaak. Dan het ons byvoorbeeld Langlaagte, wat op die pad na Soweto gele&#x00EB; is. &#x2019;n Mens kan dus verstaan watter probleme die personeel daar daagliks het. Daar is nie net die probleem van hul voertuie wat onder die klippe gesteek word nie, maar daar is ook probleme van die nabygele&#x00EB; Kleurlingkol.</p>

<p>In my kiesafdeling is daar ook die moorden roofafdeling in Johannesburg, die Brixton moord-en roofafdeling. As &#x2019;n mens saans televisie kyk, sien jy dat al die moord-en roofgevalle na hulle verwys word. Daar is natuurlik ander moord-en roofafdelings in verskillende kiesafdelings van die land, maar myne word uitgesonder omdat hulle oor die jare heen sulke goeie werk gedoen het. Daardie mense se taak kan ek eerlikwaar s&#x00EA;, strek oor die volle 24 uur van die dag. Soos ander agb. lede reeds ges&#x00EA; het, het hulle &#x2019;n geweldige taak as &#x2019;n mens daaraan dink dat hulle met moord, met roof en met verkragting te doen kry. Hulle moet die gewelddadige optrede deur ander mense bekamp. Hul lewens is dus daagliks in gevaar.</p>

<p>Daar is baie mooi woorde wat ek kan gebruik om die optrede van die agb. Minister en die topstruktuur van die Polisie te beskryf, maar ek wil eerder vanaand wys op sekere dinge wat in hierdie land gebeur. Onder die dekmantel van &#x2019;n vrye politieke lewe, het ons mense wat daardie vryheid misbruik en sekere perke oorskry. Ek dink hier veral aan 1961 toe die PFP-lid, die agb. lid vir Houghton, ges&#x00EA; het: &#x201C;We shall now concentrate on extra-political activities.&#x201D; Vanaf daardie datum het daar in hierdie land sekere eienaardige dinge begin plaasvind. Wanneer polisiemanne ooit persele betree het waar daar groot groepe PFP-ondersteuners bymekaar was, is hulle altyd gegroet met: &#x201E;Sieg Heil!&#x201D; Die doel natuurlik is om hierdie mense met die Nazi&#x2019;s te vergelyk. &#x2019;n Rukkie later is daar begin met ver-wysings na die polisiemanne as Wit rassiste, en dit moes die polisiemanne dag en nag aanhoor. Toe die Swart polisieman egter ook gebruik gemaak het van die leuse &#x201E;Ons is besig om te dien&#x201D;, word daar ges&#x00EA; hulle dien hul politieke base. Dit is toe nie meer net die Wit polisieman teen wie hulle gekant was nie, maar ook die Swart polisieman. Hulle het dit teen enigeen wat dit op hom neem om die land te beveilig en sy mense te beskerm. As daar ges&#x00EA; word hulle werk vir hul politieke base, hul politieke meesters, is dit mos daarop gemik om elke polisieman in hierdie land onder verdenking te plaas. Daar word mos dan gesuggereer dat die polisie nie op eie inisiatief kan optree nie en dat hulle nie die goeie werk kan doen wat van hulle verwag word nie. Dit suggereer mos dat die polisieman nie uitvoering gee aan die Wet nie, maar dat hy besig is om op politieke grondslag op te tree. Dit is dinge wat &#x2019;n mens nie kan wegredeneer nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Houghton het nie &#x2019;n enkele woord ges&#x00EA; oor die dogter wat op Parkstasie lewenslank vermink is nie. Sy weet egter alles van Biko af. Daar word gewoonlik verwys na A.D. of <i>Anno Domini,</i> maar in haar geval sal dit heel waarskynlik wees A.B. of <i>Anno Biko.</i> Sy het vanaand ges&#x00EA; ons sal nooit ophou om van Biko te hoor nie. Wat ek wil weet, is waarmee sy besig is. Is sy deel van &#x2019;n organisasie wat Biko in die gedagtes van mense lewendig wil hou? Wat presies is die doel as &#x2019;n mens daadwerklike pogings aanwend om die Staat se gesag, die polisie wat wet en orde moet handhaaf, verdag wil maak? Het die agb. lid <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0354"/>vir Houghton een enkele woord ges&#x00EA; oor die kind wat in Mobepane deur terroriste raak-geskiet is? Het sy gepraat van die twee polisiemanne wat doodgeskiet is? Nee, nie &#x2019;n woord nie! Sy kan egter presies s&#x00EA; wat met Biko gebeur het. Sy kan uit sy hospitaalver-slag aanhaal, sy kan van sy vroegste geskiedenis vertel, en sy kan ook vir ons alles vertel oor sy latere geskiedenis. Net soos &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n terroris tot in sy land van herkoms moet ondersoek, sal ons een of ander tyd hierdie mense tot op die been moet oopvlek om uit te vind presies waarmee hulle besig is. Dan sal ons weet presies wat daar bedoel word met verwysings na Lech Walesa van Pole en die honger kinders van Kambodja wanneer ons te doen het met die mense wat op die Kaapse Vlakte saamtrek. Hulle doen dit natuurlik om &#x2019;n intemasionale konnotasie daaraan te probeer heg. Dit is eenvoudig nie die werk van mense wat &#x2019;n land liefhet en wat opbouend teenoor daardie land wil optree nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">N. J. PRETORIUS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voor-sitter, dit is voorwaar eienaardige omstan-dighede waarin &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n debat moet voer. Toe ek vanaand hier instap en die w&#x00EA;reld so bekyk het, sien ek onmiddellik dat ons vanaand met &#x2019;n boikotbrigade te doen het. Hulle moet my nie kwalik neem as ek hulle dit noem nie, want dit is al wat hulle is. As hulle nie uit die Volksraad uitstap nie, dan stap hulle uit hierdie Komitee uit. Daar word egter nog verwag dat ons met daardie agb. lede moet debatteer. Hoe kan &#x2019;n mens egter met sulke mense &#x2019;n debat voer as hulle nie hier is nie?</p>

<p>Ek sou die agb. lid vir Houghton baie graag hier wou gehad het, en daar stem ek saam met wat die agb. lid vir Langlaagte hier te s&#x00EA; gehad het. Ek s&#x00EA; dit, want sy is die persoon&#x2014;en ek moet hierdie aanval teen haar loods terwyl sy nie hier is nie&#x2014;wat in een debat na die ander aan die Polisie en die agb. Minister van Polisie alles toedig wat sy moontlik aan hulle kan toedig. Onder die begrotingspos Samewerking en Ontwikkeling het die agb. lid vir Houghton weer eens, soos in die debat oor die begrotingspos Polisie verlede jaar, die Polisie daarvan beskuldig dat hulle besig is om hul tyd daaraan te bestee om persone te arresteer vir pasoor-tredings en ander minder belangrike oortredings. Dan vra sy ook hoekom hulle hul nie toespits op die ernstiger oortredings sodat daardie sake opgelos kan word nie. Dit was wat sy inderdaad gevra het. Wat sy egter nie besef nie, is dat die Polisie wel die een doen sonder om na te laat om die ander ook te doen. Waarom s&#x00EA; sy dit nie? Nee, dit word natuurlik nie ges&#x00EA; nie. Daardie mense wil net afbreek sover hulle kan. In die verlede het die agb. lid vir Houghton &#x2019;n baie lelike houding teenoor die Polisie ingeneem. Dit laat my dink aan &#x2019;n bul in &#x2019;n arena. As die rooi doek voor hom gehang word, storm hy. Met die agb. lid is dit dieselfde. As sy die woorde &#x201E;polisieman&#x201D; of &#x201E;Minister van Polisie&#x201D; hoor, storm sy blindelings op hulle af. Wat baat dit haar egter? Wat baat dit in der waarheid enigeen in daardie boikotbrigade om so op te tree? &#x2019;n Mens kan niks in hul koppe inkry nie. Helaas, ek het gehoop daar sou &#x2019;n verandering intree, maar tevergeefs. Ek laat die agb. lid egter daar.</p>

<p>Nou wend ek my graag tot die Pers. Daar is iets wat ek hulle mooi wil vra. Ek verwys spesifiek na die hoofberigte wat geskryf word oor die polisie, en ek gaan onmiddellik een voorbeeld daarvan noem. In een koerant was daar die opskrif &#x201E;Police Brutality&#x201D;. Dit is die soort opskrifte wat in ons koerante verskyn. Dit is die soort ding wat die Pers doen. Dit is net wat die vyande van hierdie land verlang. Dit is wat hulle soek. Die oor-grote meerderheid van die &#x201E;inligting&#x201D; wat deur Suid-Afrika se vyande uitgebuit word, kom uit ons Suid-Afrikaanse koerante. Die teenoorgestelde sy van die saak word egter nooit gestel nie. As daar bewys word dat die koerante verkeerd was en dat die polisie wel reg opgetree het, word daar nooit melding daarvan gemaak nie, of altans baie min. Kan agb. lede dus sien waar ons probleme l&#x00EA;? Ek wil derhalwe vanaand &#x2019;n pleidooi lewer. Ek wil vra dat die Pers in hierdie land en die agb. lede oorkant, wat vanaand nie hier is nie, meer diskresie aan die dag moet l&#x00EA; wanneer berigte geskryf word, asook in privaat-gesprekke met ander mense en in uitsprake wat gelewer word. Ek sluit aan by wat die agb. Minister ges&#x00EA; het, en ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie word toenemend deur alle bevolkingsgemeen-skappe aanvaar as &#x2019;n mag van vriende &#x2026;</block>

<p>En ek onderskryf die gedagte dat dit &#x2019;n &#x201E;mag van vriende&#x201D; is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0355"/>&#x2026; en in di&#x00E9; verband lewer die Polisie &#x2019;n reusediens vir die verbetering van mense-verhoudings.</block>

<p>Dit is wat die agb. Minister van Polisie ges&#x00EA; het. My raad aan die Pers en die agb. Minister van Polisie ges&#x00EA; het. My raad aan die Pers en die agb. Opposisie wat nie hier is nie, is: Maak vriende met die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie, want dan sal dit baie beter gaan in hierdie land van ons.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by my eie kiesafdeling, Umhlatuzana. Binne die grense van hierdie kiesafdeling is daar die munisipale gebied van Queensburgh. Queensburgh is binne die grense van my kiesafdeling gele&#x00EB;. Dit is &#x2019;n bietjie meer as 100 jaar gelede gestig. Dit is interessant om daarop te let dat Queensburgh 100 jaar gelede nie &#x2019;n polisiemag gehad het nie, maar die gewone burgers het die patrolliewerk gedoen om wet en orde te handhaaf. In latere jare het die Natalse Berede Polisie hierdie verantwoordelikheid oorgeneem. Wat ook interessant is, is dat &#x2019;n inwoner van daardie gebied sy huis aan die Polisie geskenk het om &#x2019;n polisiestasie daar te open. Dit is toe ook gedoen. In 1913 het die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie daardie mense in hul geledere opgeneem. Daardie huis is toe weer eens gebruik as &#x2019;n polisiestasie. Vandag word daardie huis nog gebruik deur die stasiebevoerder van die Malvempolisie-stasie.</p>

<p>Die polisie lewer net die beste diens in daardie kiesafdeling van my. Tot omtrent vyf jaar gelede het hulle ook as brandweer-manne opgetree. Gedurende die oorstromings van 1978 was hulle die Stadsraad ook behulpsaam met reddingswerk binne die grense van daardie kiesafdeling. Hulle werk saam met die owerhede. Dit is vir my baie duidelik dat die polisie in enige geordende staat &#x2019;n onontbeerlike rol speel ter handhawing van wet en orde om die gelukkige saam-bestaan van die inwoners van &#x2019;n land te ver-seker.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur die dank en waardering van die inwoners van my kiesafdeling oor te dra aan al die lede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie. As &#x2019;n klein blykie van waardering het die Stadsraad onder leiding van die Burgemeester op 22 Augustus vanjaar die ereburgerskap van Queensburgh aan die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie oorhandig. Die Kommis-saris het die ereburgerskap namens die Mag in ontvangs geneem. My oproep aan almal vanaand is dus: Help om die Mag oral en by almal as vriende aanvaar te kry.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in teenstelling met die agb. lid vir Lang-laagte, wat die meeste polisiemanne in sy kiesafdeling het, kan ek daarop roem dat ek seker die minste polisiemanne in my kiesafdeling het. Ek het egter die voorreg gehad om minder as &#x2019;n week gelede samesprekings te gevoer het met die hoofde van daardie gedeelte van my kiesafdeling, en ek kan met vrymoedigheid vanaand die goeie wense en die fiere ondersteuning van die Polisiemag uit my kiesafdeling aan die agb. Minister van Polisie oordra, asook aan die hoofde van die departement. Ek kan agb. lede daarvan verseker dat die agb. Minister, genl. Geldenhuys en sy personeel ho&#x00EB; waardering en agting afdwing by die polisiemanne in my kiesafdeling. Ek rig dan ook &#x2019;n woord van dank aan die Polisie in die algemeen, vanaf die agb. Minister reg deur tot by die konstabels, vir alles wat hulle vir ons en ons land beteken.</p>

<p>Ek wil egter graag ook spesifiek melding maak van die forensiese laboratorium onder die hoofskap van Generaal-majoor Neethling. Dit is &#x2019;n tak wat met gesofistikeerde en hoogs wetenskaplike werk besig is wat sekerlik vir ons en vir die Polisiemag baie beteken. Ook aan daardie mense kan ons nie nalaat om &#x2019;n besondere woord van dank te rig nie. Ons wil hulle ook vra om met hierdie hoogs wetenskaplike werk wat reeds w&#x00EA;reldberoemdheid verwerf het, voort te gaan. Ons wil ook net aan hulle s&#x00EA; dat ons dankbaar is vir die feit dat ons ook mense van ho&#x00EB; gehalte in ons Polisiemag het.</p>

<p>Die amptelike Opposisie is vanaand nie in hierdie Komitee teenwoordig nie, en in hierdie opsig wil ek dus spesifiek die NRP krediet gee vir die feit dat hulle ten minste teenwoordig is.</p>

<p>Ek wil my vanaand meer spesifiek bepaal by &#x2019;n ander groepie mense wat hulself die Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging noem. Die rede waarom ek na hulle verwys, is omdat hulle mos die mense is wat hul eie beskermingsmag, wat hulle die Stormvalke noem, op die been wil bring om hul leier en ander lede te beskerm. Ek wil eerstens &#x2019;n oomblikkie stilstaan by die leier van die Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, mnr. <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0356"/>Eugene Terre&#x2019;Blanche. Eerstens wil ek aandui hoe ek hierdie mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche sien. Ek sien hom as &#x2019;n regse radikale wat sy optrede op rassisme baseer. Hier onderskryf ek die woorde wat die agb. lid vir Florida in &#x2019;n vroe&#x00EB;r debat gebruik het. Ek sien hom as &#x2019;n groot lawaaimaker met gefrustreerde aspirasies. In sy geval gaan dit alles oor homself en geensins oor die saak wat gedien moet word nie. Hy is &#x2019;n idealis wat nie bereid is om vir sy ideale te werk nie. In sy ideali-seringsproses kan hy sy gedagtes vrye teuels gee om onsinnighede uit te dink soos optogte na die Uniegebou, drukgroepe, die moontlike ontvoering van Volksraadslede en &#x2019;n landwye propagandaveldtog. As hy miskien enige politieke ideale koester, waarom het hy hom nie in die onlangse verkiesing vier maande gelede as kandidaat beskikbaar gestel nie, en waarom het hy nie ook van sy volgelinge aanges&#x00EA; om as kandidate die politieke arena te betree nie? Nee, dit kon hulle nie bekostig nie, want hulle sal mos nooit hul program van beginsels en ideologie aan die kieserspubliek kan verkoop nie. Die ergste is natuurlik&#x2014;en ek is daarvan oortuig&#x2014; dat die leier van die Afrikaner Weerstandbe-weging homself sien as die tweede Hitler van die w&#x00EA;reld. Hierdie gedagte is vir hom so vleiend dat hy die klits heeltemal kwyt raak en dan met sy belaglike optrede vorendag kom. Hy s&#x00EA; self in die program van beginsels van die Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sou &#x2019;n diktatuur uit die struktuur van die Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging voortspruit, sal die behoud van die Blanke ras ten minste verseker word.</block>

<p>Dit is duidelik die gedagte of ideaal wat hy koester. Hierdie beweging dreig nou om &#x2019;n eie private polisiemag op die been te bring. Hulle s&#x00EA; ook die Blitskommando is nie net daar om plakkate op te hang, vergaderings te reel of verkeer te reguleer nie; hulle is ook daar om wet en orde te handhaaf. Dit is egter waar hierdie voortvarende mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche sy vingers gaan brand. In die proses kan daar van sy volgelinge seerkry of met die Polisie bots, bloot as gevolg van hul eie avontuurlustigheid. Hierdie mense moet nie die werk van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie in eie hande probeer neem nie. Hulle moet nie probeer om verkeer te reguleer nie, want selfs dan sal daar ook teen hulle opgetree word deur die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie en ons eie verkeerspolisie. Onopgeleide en ongekwalifiseerde motorfietsryers kan nie en moet nie probeer om die werk van die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie in eie hande te neem nie. Sodoende gaan hulle moeilikheid optel, want in sulke omstandighede sal daar beslis teen hulle opgetree word. Ek wonder ook net teen wie of teen wat mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche hom wil laat beskerm deur hierdie persoonlike beskermingseenheid wat hy so graag op die been wil bring? Hy was tog nooit in gevaar nie. Inteendeel, die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie sal hom ook beskerm as hy bedreig word. Dit was mos mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche wat ongemanierd en sonder eerbied wanorde geskep het by &#x2019;n behoorlike vergadering wat by Fochville gehou is. Die spreker daardie aand was die huidige agb. Minister van Staatsadministrasie en van Statistiek. Mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche en sy volgelinge het gedurende die vergadering daar opgedaag, en soveel ongeskiktheid en barbarisme het ek lanklaas gesien. Dit was vreeslik soos daardie mense daardie aand opgetree het.</p>

<p>Wat meer is, die groot leier van die AWB, die tweede Hitler van die w&#x00EA;reld, en sy ongeveer 40 volgelinge is deur slegs 10 polisiemanne uit die saai verwyder. Dit is mos voldoende bewys daarvan dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie baie effektief en doeltreffend is. &#x2019;n Paar polisiemanne kon binne &#x2019;n japtrap die saai skoonmaak en ontslae raak van daardie ongewenste euwels wat nou onder ons volk begin groei het. Met so &#x2019;n Polisiemag behoort daardie mense te weet&#x2014;veral na so &#x2019;n ondervinding&#x2014;dat hulle in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika veilig is. Mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche hoef dus nie &#x2019;n eie beskermingsmag op die been te bring om hom te beskerm nie.</p>

<p>Daar kom egter &#x2019;n verdere vraag by my op. Toe die lede van die Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, met mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche aan die spits, &#x2019;n vergadering van die agb. Eerste Minister op Potchefstroom bygewoon het, het daar nie &#x2019;n enkele woord van hulle gekom nie. Waarom? Toe die agb. Minister van Polisie &#x2019;n vergadering op Brits toegespreek het en daar ongeveer 100 lede van die <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0357"/>Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging teenwoordig was, het hulle weer eens geen woord van hulle laat hoor nie. Daar was doodse stilte van hul kant, nieteenstaande die feit dat die agb. Minister hulle genooi het om met hom in gesprek te tree.</p>

<p>Wanneer hulle egter in sale vergader, gaan die vergadering gewoonlik gepaard met die speel van Duitse marsmusiek en die gestamp van voete. Hulle gaan egter verder en om atmosfeer te skep, is die manne in swart hemde en broeke geklee, en met kamaste aan. Mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche en sy volgelinge word dan deur daardie atmosfeer so meegesleur dat hulle onmiddellik &#x2019;n vroe&#x00EB; verldesing wil afdwing, en dit net vier maande na &#x2019;n algemene verkiesing waaraan hulle self nie deelgeneem het nie en nie wou deelneem nie.</p>

<p>Nou begin hierdie beweging ook nog vry na die steun van die Engelssprekendes. So hard word daar gevry na die Engelssprekendes dat mnr. Terre&#x2019;Blanche verlede maand &#x2019;n rubriek in &#x2019;n Wesrandse koerant geskryf het om sy organisasie aan die Engelssprekendes voor te stel. Ek moet dus ook &#x2019;n waarskuwing aan Engelssprekendes rig. Dit is des te meer jammer dat die amptelike Opposisie nie vanaand hier teenwoordig is nie, want dit lyk vir my hulle is die mense wat in gevaar mag wees.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, laat my asseblief toe om by hierdie aangeleentheid aan te sluit by wat ges&#x00EA; is deur die agb. lid vir Losberg toe hy die twee agb. lede oorkant, die agb. lid vir Suidkus en die agb. lid vir Umhlanga, bedank vir hul belangstelling in hierdie debat. Ons bedank hulle vir die feit dat hulle wel vanaand hier teenwoordig is. Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad waardeer dit opreg. Dit is iets wat ek met diep oortuiging vanaand hier kan s&#x00EA;. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is jammer dat die amptelike Opposisie se banke vanaand leeg staan en dat hulle moet skitter in hul afwe-sigheid. Ek hoop dat Suid-Afrika van hierdie situasie sal kennis neem. Ek wil ook by hierdie geleentheid namens hierdie kant van die Raad ons verskoning oordra aan die agb. Minister wat hierdie Begrotingspos hanteer en aan die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie waaroor die bespreking van hierdie Begrotingspos vanaand gaan.</p>

<p>Dit is met groot pi&#x00EB;teit teenoor ons Polisie dat ons vandag die Begrotingspos Polisie bespreek. Ek wil ons opregte waardering aan die agb. Minister van Polisie oordra vir hierdie geleentheid wat aan ons gebied word.</p>

<p>Die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie bestaan uit drie afdelings, naamlik die Speurdiens, die Uniformdiens en die Veiligheidsdiens. Die Polisiemag is op &#x2019;n semi-milit&#x00EA;re grondslag saamgestel en het &#x2019;n gebied van ongeveer 2 miljoen vierkante kilometer om te dek. Die polisie is veelvolkig en hul taak is primer om wet en orde te handhaaf. Aan die begin van hierdie eeu is Suid-Afrika deur sekere stedelike en nie-stedelike Polisiemagte bedien, byvoorbeeld die &#x201E;Orange River Colony Police&#x201D;, die &#x201E;Natal Police&#x201D; en die &#x201E;Cape Mounted Police&#x201D;. Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie &#x2019;n semi-milit&#x00EA;re organisasie is. Dit is wel so. Saam met die Suid-Afrikaanse Weermag bekamp die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie insurgensie op ons lands-grense deur terroriste. Agb. lede sal hulle daaraan herinner dat ek in &#x2019;n vorige toespraak ges&#x00EA; het dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie tydens die Tweede W&#x00EA;reld-oorlog &#x2019;n gedugte vegseenheid was. Die slag van Sidi Rezeg, El Alamein en Tobruk is voldoende bewys hiervan.</p>

<p>Gedurende 1910 is &#x2019;n konferensie van die vier provinsies, onder voorsitterskap van E. F. Lonsdale, destydse sekretaris van die Departement van Wetstoepassing in Kaapland, <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0358"/>bel&#x00EA;. Deur middel van die Transvaalse Polisiewet van 1908 is die eerste Kommis-saris van Polisie aangestel, naamlik Kol. T. G. Truter. As gevolg van misdaadbekamping deur die Polisie, was die volgende prestasies in die verband gedurende die boekjaar 1979-&#x2019;80 behaal. Dit is interessant om na die statistiek te kyk. Wat oortredings met betrekking tot Staatsveiligheid betref, is 261 klagtes gel&#x00EA;, en is 37&#x0025; van die sake opgelos. Daar was 121 229 gevalle van drankmisbruik waarvan 95&#x0025; opgelos is. Wat oortredings met betrekking tot dwelmmiddels betref, was daar 33 739 gevalle waarvan 99&#x0025; opgelos is. Wat oortredings met betrekking tot afhanklikheidsvormende medisynes betref, was daar 613 oortredings waarvan 85&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 8 009 moordsake, waarvan 74&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 132 574 gevalle van ernstige aanranding waarvan 89&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 337 429 gevalle van diefstal waarvan 41&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 21 601 gevalle van bedrog waarvan 76&#x0025; opgelos is. Wat oortredings ingevolge onwettige goud-en diamanthandel betref, was daar 602 oortredings waarvan 97&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 620 oortredings ingevolge die Insolvensiewet waarvan 86&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 45 297 gevalle van roof waarvan 58&#x0025; opgelos is. Daar was 29 775 gevalle van veediefstal waarvan 74&#x0025; opgelos is. Nou kom ek by die belangrikste aspek van die statistiek wat ek tot dusver verstrek het. Die totale misdaadsyfer was 1 111 484, waarvan 64&#x0025; van oortredings in totaal opgelos is. Dit beantwoord die vraag wat die agb. lid vir Houghton gestel het waarom die Polisie hulle nie besig hou met wetstoepassing nie in plaas daarvan om die publiek te &#x201E;harass&#x201D;. Ek wil vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n polisiemag wat bloot mense &#x201E;harass&#x201D; nie sulke prestasies behaal nie.</p>

<p>Die hoofkantoor van die S.A. Polisie is in Pretoria gesetel en bestaan uit die volgende afdelings: Die Kwartiermeesterpersoneel, die Polisiekollege, die Kriminele Buro, die Forensiese Laboratorium, die Narkotikaburo en die Hondeskool. Daar is altesaam 97 polisiedistrikte landswyd, wat in polisie-stasie-gebiede ingedeel is onder die bevel van stasiebevelvoerders, distrikskommandante en afdelingkommissarisse. Dan is daar 936 polisiestasies en grensposte dwarsoor die land. In die boekjaar 1980-&#x2019;81 het die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie &#x2019;n personeelsterkte van 35 136 gehad, verteenwoordigend van alle bevolkingsgroepe. Daar was 1 125 Indi&#x00EB;rs, 2 111 Kleurlinge, 14 300 Swartes en 17 600 Blankes in diens van die S.A. Polisie. In uitvoering van Regeringsbeleid deur veelvolkige ontwikkeling te bevorder, word bevolkingsgroepe en gemeenskappe deur eiesoortiges bedien. 32 Polisiestasies word reeds deur Nieblanke polisiemanne in Nie-blanke woongebiede bedien, 17 polisiestasies deur Swartes, 14 deur Kleurlinge en 1 deur Indi&#x00EB;rs. Geskiedenis is gemaak deur dames op dieselfde diensvoorwaardes as mans in diens te neem. By beraming is die verhouding tussen die Polisie en die totale bevolking ongeveer 1,5 per duisend. Die Polisiereser-wemag is uiters doeltreffend en bestaan reeds sedert 1973. Die Reserwemag word grootliks beman deur lede van die publiek en oud-lede van die Polisiemag.</p>

<p>Vir diegene wat intens in polisieonder-soeke van die verlede belangstel, sal die polisiemuseum uiters interessant wees. Voorwerpe wat as bewysstukke in sekere moordsake gedien het, word daar op &#x2019;n besondere wyse uitgestal en basies word alle fasette van &#x2019;n ondersoek op uiters effektiewe wyse uitgestal.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek s&#x00EA; dat danksy die doeltreffende optrede van die S.A. Polisie terrorisme sedert 1965 bekamp word. Daarvoor wil ons namens alle vredeliewende Suid-Afrikaners ons innige dank en waardering aan die agb. Minister van Polisie, die Kommissaris van Polisie en, laaste maar nie die minste nie, alle polisiemanne oordra. Ek wil ook my dank betuig teenoor die agb. Minister en die Kommissaris wat gedurende die reses verlede jaar by ons in Germiston besoek afgel&#x00EA; het en persoonlik kom kyk het wat die behoeftes van ons stad is, te wete die oprigting van &#x2019;n polisiekompleks. Ek verneem nou dat die perseel reeds verkry is en ek hoop dat die agb. Minister die oprigting van &#x2019;n nuwe polisiestasie in Germiston hoog op die voorkeurlys sal plaas.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN POLISIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is my aangename voorreg om net &#x2019;n paar afsluitende opmerkings te maak. Ek wil graag van die geleentheid gebruik maak om al die lede aan my kant van die Raad baie hartlik te bedank vir die besondere belangstelling wat hulle in die debat getoon het en die netjiese voorbereiding en <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0359"/>aanbieding van hulle bydraes. Ek sal in die loop van my toespraak terugkom op &#x2019;n paar van die aangeleenthede wat deur agb. lede geopper is.</p>

<p>I also wish to express a word of thanks to the hon. member for Umhlanga for his very kind remarks about the S.A. Police in general and in regard to certain matters he raised in particular. I am also thankful for the interest shown by the hon. members of the NRP in being present here until the end of this particular debate. I know that they are heavily understaffed and that it takes some doing to be present in both chambers. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlanga referred to the staff shortage in the Force and he also suggested that it may be a good thing for the Police not to be part and parcel of the Commission for State Administration. I do not want to argue this particular issue tonight. I have made a note of the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks, but all I want to say now is that during the past year, notwithstanding the very difficult negotiations and some very serious misunderstandings, we have been very well served by the Commission for State Administration. They have been very sympathetic towards us and at this stage, with the Commission and the Treasury giving attention to matters pertaining to the Police Force, as well as the general attitude of all concerned towards matters affecting the Police, I have very few complaints.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to staff shortages and enquired about the statistics in this regard. May I just say that the total strength of the Force today is 43 815 and that we have a shortage of just over 9 000. The hon. member also referred to the National Servicemen doing their service in the S.A. Police. May I just explain that we select the National Servicemen who intimate that they would like to serve in the S.A. Police. We, therefore, do not just take anybody who is interested. We may get 300 applications and only select 200 of them. I can assure the hon. member that none of these members block any form of promotion of any permanent member of the Force and/ or any member who may be interested in promotion.</p>

<p>The hon. member also inquired about the reasons for the low percentage of ex-members of the Force who are re-enlisted. There are quite a number of reasons for this and one of more of the reasons may apply in individual circumstances.</p>

<p>In die eerste plek kry &#x2019;n mens die geval dat baie manne hul ontslag neem om daardeur oneervolle ontslag te vermy. Ander pleeg weer byvoorbeeld ernstige oortredings terwyl hulle buite die Mag is. Ander lede wat uit die diens getree het se gesondheid het miskien intussen verswak en voldoen nie meer aan die vereistes wat die Polisie stel nie. Ander doen aansoek om terug te kom en trek dan weer hulle aansoeke terug voordat dit gefinaliseer kan word. Daar is dus baie redes waarom daar &#x2019;n groot getal manne is wat oorspronklik aandui dat hulle wil terugkom na die Polisie toe, maar dat net &#x2019;n klein getal van hulle uiteindelik aanvaar word.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to a particular probleem he had with regard to one of his constituents obtaining a firearms licence. I appreciate his probleem. If the hon. member would only be so kind as to telephone my office tomorrow morning I will personally go into the matter and I can assure him that he will try to expedite the application. There is no apparent reason why the application should take so long to be processed, but there may be some good reason for this and we will attend to it immediately.</p>

<p>I have already assured the hon. member that we will give the Umhlali area our attention. We will look into the problems and the suggestions of the hon. member. I think that covers the points raised by the hon. member. The hon. member&#x2019;s colleague unfortunately did not address the House, but I nevertheless wish him well. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Ek wil nou baie kortliks terugkom op die toesprake van die agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad. Die agb. lid vir Verwoerdburg het sy gewone stewige bydrae gelewer waaraan ons al in hierdie Raad gewoond geraak het. Ek bedank hom daarvoor. Ek het reeds in my toespraak vroe&#x00EB;r vanmiddag &#x2019;n wye terrein gedek oor onderwerpe wat ook deur hom aangeroer is en hy sal saamstem dat ek reeds die wese van sy toespraak bespreek het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Krugersdorp het interes <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0360"/>sant&#x00E9; gedagtes uitgespreek met betrekking tot die Wet op Binnelandse Veiligheid. Ons moet egter net &#x2019;n bietjie wag totdat die Rabie-kommissie se verslag beskikbaar is. Hierdie wetgewing en alle ander Veiligheids-wetgewing dien voor die Rabie-kommissie. Die verslag is feitlik voltooi en kan binne die volgende paar weke beskikbaar wees. Sodra daardie verslag deur die Regering beskikbaar gestel word, kan ons weer kyk na die gedagtes wat die agb. lid geopper het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Algoa het baie mooi kom-plimente tot die Polisie in die algemeen gerig en ek bedank hom daarvoor.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Roodepoort het verskeie vrae gestel wat uit die jaarverslag voortspruit. Ek sal toesien dat die agb. lid skriftelik volledig geantwoord word met betrekking tot sy vrae oor die statistiese gegewens wat hy aangevra het. Wat sy verwysing na die lede van die Handelstak betref, gee ek hom graag die versekering dat ons voorstelle vir volgende jaar se begroting reeds ingedien is en deur die Kommissie vir Staatsadministrasie bespreek word. In die loop van die jaar sal daar baie aandag hieraan geskenk word en inbegrepe by daardie voorstelle is daar aspekte met betrekking tot beroepsdifferen-siasie, wat aansluit by die gedagtes wat die agb. lid uitgespreek het. Ek kan nie nou in meer besonderhede daarop ingaan nie en ek dink ook nie dat die agb. lid dit van my verwag nie. In &#x2019;n private gesprek kan ek vir die agb. lid &#x2019;n bietjie meer inligting daaroor gee, maar dit is nie nou die geleentheid om dit in die openbaar te doen nie. Wat opnamema-sjiene betref, is dit &#x2019;n positiewe gedagte waaraan ons beslis aandag sal gee. Wat die agb. lid se gedagtes oor Polisieverhore betref, kan ek volstaan deur vir die agb. lid die versekering te gee dat ek meer besonderhede aan hom sal kan verstrek as hy so vriendelik sal wees om my op kantoor te besoek. Ons het egter van sy gedagtes en die interessante navorsing wat hy gedoen het, kennis geneem. Ek was nie van al daardie feite bewus nie, maar ek wil net bevestig wat ek vroe&#x00EB;r vanmiddag ges&#x00EA; het, naamlik dat ons oor die algemeen nie werklik klagtes van polisiemanne kry oor die prosedure wat in departementele verhore gevolg word en die objektiwiteit van voorsittende beamptes wanneer die verhore plaasvind nie. Dit geld ook vir die hersieningsproses wat daarna gevolg word, selfs op app&#x00E8;l en andersins. Ek bedank die agb. lid vir sy bydrae.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Aliwal het &#x2019;n bepaalde saak geopper, naamlik die onlangse terroris-tebedrywighede in Oos-Kaapland en het veral verwys na die dapper optrede van lede van die Mag. Lede van die Mag op Aliwal en van ander dorpe in sy kiesafdeling was hierby betrokke. By geleentheid was daar amper 250 polisiemanne by hierdie operasie betrokke, asook lede van die Lugmag wat helikopterdienste voorsien het. Die manne het groot dapperheid aan die dag gel&#x00EA; en ons het waardering daarvoor. Ons is net baie jammer dat van ons manne in die proses beseer is, sommige van hulle nogal ernstig. Dit blyk dat daar selfs een of twee manne kan wees wat baie ernstige letsels sal oorhou van die beserings wat hulle opgedoen het. Ons is almal baie jammer daaroor en ek sal bly wees indien die agb. lid ons almal se besondere dank persoonlik aan die lede van die Mag in sy kiesafdeling sal oordra. Met betrekking tot veediefstalle het die agb. lid &#x2019;n paar interessante opmerkings gemaak. Ek kan die agb. lid die versekering gee dat ons in sy gebied reeds gebruik maak van helikopters in die opsporing van veediewe. Ons maak ook van veldmotorfietse, perde en ander vervoermiddels gebruik om die moeilike terrein baas te raak. Van Natal tot in Noord-Kaapland in die agb. lid se kiesafdeling is daar 22 veediefstaleenhede van die Mag bedrywig. Hierdie 22 eenhede het oor &#x2019;n gegewe tydperk van &#x2019;n jaar 31 062 sake gehad om op te los en het oplospersentasie van 45,43&#x0025; behaal wat ek dink &#x2019;n baie mooi prestasie is. Die agb. lid het ook gevra dat ons baie dringend aandag moet skenk aan die polisiestasie sonder elektriese krag in sy kiesafdeling. Ons skenk reeds aandag daaraan, maar aangesien die agb. lid dit nou weer geopper het, sal ons weer daarna kyk.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Overvaal het ook &#x2019;n netjiese bydrae gelewer, veral oor die gebied waarvandaan hy kom. Met betrekking tot die reservistemag waarna die agb. lid verwys het, wil ek net in aansluiting by my toespraak verlede jaar onder die Begrotingspos &#x2019;n paar opmerkings oor die Junior Reservistemag maak. Daar is nou besluit om met die stigting van &#x2019;n Junior Reserwepolisiemag voort te gaan. Ek wil dit duidelik stel dat dit op die volgende grondslag sal geskied. Slegs seuns van 16 jaar of ouer sal kwalifiseer. <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0361"/>Toetrede is absoluut vrywillig en met die skriftelike toestemming van die applikant se ouers of wettige voog. Hy moet liggaamlik geskik wees. Hulle dienste sal heeltemal buite skoolverband en tydens skoolvakansies benut word. Geen vergoeding word vir dienste betaal nie, maar vervoer en verskaffing van uitrustings sal op Staatskoste geskied. Uniforms word nie verskaf nie, maar &#x2019;n sigbare uitkenningsteken sal gedra word. Behoorlike toesig, beheer en dissipline sal te alle tye gehandhaaf word, terwyl gewaak sal word dat lede nie in gevaarlike situasies beland nie. Opleiding in basiese polisiepligte sal aangebied word. Laastens sal skoolverlaters wat lede van die Junior Reserwepolisiemag is en dienspligtig word se dienste onmiddellik be&#x00EB;indig word sodat hulle hul diensplig kan doen. Geen ander aktiwiteite waaraan leerlinge buite skoolverband moet deelneem soos kadetkampe, ens. sal deur diens in die Junior Reserwemag ingekort of verydel word nie. Ek dink hierdie saak sal met baie goeie gevolge verder gevoer kan word.</p>

<p>Ek bedank graag die agb. lid vir Jeppe vir sy besonder komplimenterende opmerking teenoor die vroue van polisiemanne. Dit spyt my dat ek nie &#x2019;n aantekening gemaak het van watter persentasie van die pensioen van &#x2019;n polisiebeampte &#x2019;n weduwee kry nie, maar ek kan die agb. lid die versekering gee dat dit &#x2019;n stewige persentasie van so &#x2019;n lid se pensioen is wat na sy afsterwe aan sy weduwee betaal word. Wat ons departementele administrasie betref, word sulke aangeleent-hede met die hoogste spoed afgehandel. Ek dra kennis van sake wat binne &#x2019;n paar dae afgehandel is. Ek kan die agb. lid die verse-kering gee dat ons goed omsien na die wedu-wees en afhanklike kinders van lede van die Mag wat te sterwe mag kom.</p>

<p>Sonder dat ek in besonderhede hoef in te gaan, het die agb. lid vir Pretoria-Wes weer eens &#x2019;n stewige bydrae gelewer. Ek bedank hom daarvoor. Die generaal-majoor waarna die agb. lid verwys het, verkeer gelukkig nog in goeie gesondheid en ons is daarvoor dankbaar.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Langlaagte het verwys na die omstandighede van polisiemanne in Booysens. Die Booysens-polisiestasie gaan opgerig word. My inligting van die Kommis-saris is dat die voorlopige tenderdatum Oktober 1982 is met &#x2019;n kontraktydperk van 22 maande. Die nuwe gebou sal ook voor-siening maak vir &#x2019;n distrikshoofkwartier, polisiestasie en enkelkwartiere. Daar word intussen ook ernstige aandag gegee aan die beveiliging van die bestaande kompleks en, wat hofgeriewe betref, sal dit die nodige aandag kry wanneer die nuwe kompleks gebou word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Umhlatuzana het &#x2019;n mooi beroep op almal van ons, as individue en ook op die Pers, gedoen om meer beheersd te wees in ons uitsprake. Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n baie groot eer wat die plekke Queens-borough in die agb. lid se kiesafdeling teenoor die S.A. Polisie bewys het deur die ereburgerskap van Queensborough aan die Kommissaris van Polisie in sy amptelike hoedanigheid toe te ken. Dit is die eerste keer in die geskiedenis van die Mag dat dit gebeur en almal van ons in die S.A. Polisie het die grootste waardering daarvoor. Geliewe ook weer eens my persoonlike dank aan die dorpsraad oor te dra vir hierdie besondere eer.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Losberg het die AWB vanaand baie effektief geantwoord. Ek wil daarby aansluit en s&#x00EA; dat ons moet aanvaar dat as lede van die AWB met hulle swart hemde, swart broeke en kamaste openbare gekke van hulself wil maak, moet hulle dit maar doen. Hulle moet net nie inmeng met die werksaamhede van die S.A. Polisie nie. Hulle moet nie aan ons dikteer hoe &#x2019;n ordelike bestel in &#x2019;n samelewing gere&#x00EB;l moet word nie, want dan sal hulle hul vasloop. Solank hulle aan die regte kant van die wet bly en hulle gaan voort om van hulself gekke te maak, moet hulle dit maar doen. Ons is met belangriker dinge in die lewe besig en die agb. lid het hulle heel effektief geantwoord.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Germiston het met sy gewone eerlike geesdrif oor die Polisie gepraat. Hy het &#x2019;n pragtige oorsig oor die ontstaan en werksaamhede van die Mag gegee en ek bedank hom daarvoor. Ek kan hom die versekering gee dat met sy hulp en die hulp van &#x2019;n paar ander vriende in die openbare sektor ons daardie groot kompleks in Germiston nog gebou sal kry in my en die Kommissaris se tyd, as alles goed gaan. Ons werk hard daaraan.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit met &#x2019;n paar slotgedagtes. In die afgelope jaar is alle lede van die Polisiemag met dieselfde uniforms toegerus. Dit <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0362"/>geld vir Wit, Swart, Kleurling en Asi&#x00EB;r. Ons het reeds begin met die opleiding van Kleurlingvroue as polisiebeamptes. Ons het die vereiste gestel dat dit net matrikulante moet wees, asook ander vereistes, en het baie meer aansoeke van matrikulante ontvang as wat ons kan akkommodeer. Ons kon &#x2019;n uitstekende groep Kleurlingvroue selekteer wat reeds met hulle opleiding begin het. Ons sal binnekort met die Indi&#x00EB;rvroue in Durban begin. Ons sal al vroeg volgende jaar met die opleiding van Swartvroue kon begin as dit nie was dat ons &#x2019;n geweldige tekort aan akkommodasie by Hammanskraal ondervind nie. Ons probeer egter ons bes om daardie probleem opgelos te kry en sal dan met daardie opleiding begin.</p>

<p>Verder wil ek ook net s&#x00EA; dat ek in die afgelope paar maande besluit het dat die eksamenstandaard wat in die S.A. Polisie vereis word dieselfde sal wees vir alle lede van die Mag ongeag aan watter rassegroep hulle behoort. Daar is geen kleurfaktor nie. Daar is 43 000 polisiemanne in die Mag en almal van hulle het &#x2019;n gelyke geleentheid om hulle eksamens te skryf, daarin te slaag en na aanleiding daarvan bevordering te kry. Dit hang van elke lid af in watter mate hy in staat is om dit te doen.</p>

<p>Die S.A. Polisie het in die afgelope jaar sy eie credo saamgestel. Dit het &#x2019;n pragtige bewoording en is gebaseer op die aanhef van die Grondwet. Ons het reeds baie mooi modelie daarvan gemaak waarvan een in my kantoor hang. Ons het eksemplare daarvan aan die Staatspresident en die Eerste Minister geskenk en ons is trots daarop dat dit ook in hulle kantore hang. Dit is die S.A. Polisie se eie credo en ek is besig om kleurfoto&#x2019;s daarvan te laat voorberei. Ek sal aan elke lid van die Polisiegroep aan hierdie kant van die Raad en aan die kant van die NRP &#x2019;n foto laat kry. Dit is &#x2019;n baie mooi stuk werk. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Nee, hulle is dan nie eens vanaand hier nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook vir agb. lede s&#x00EA; dat ons in die afgelope paar maande die amptelike S.A. Polisievlag van die Staatspresident in ontvangs geneem het by wyse van &#x2019;n groot parade wat in Pretoria plaasgevind het. Voortaan sal die S.A. Polisievlag by alle belangrike en/of seremoni&#x00EB;le geleenthede saam met die vlag van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika wapper. Ons is baie trots daarop, want dit is &#x2019;n pragtige vlag. Diegene wat dit nog nie gesien het nie, kan gerus na &#x2019;n baie mooi foto daarvan in my kantoor kom kyk.</p>

<p>Dit is nie &#x2019;n nuwe aankondiging nie, maar ek wil tog vir agb. lede s&#x00EA; dat ons baie ver gevorder is met die oprigting van die S.A. Polisiemonument. Die geld daarvoor is klaar ingesamel en argitekte is besig met die ont-werpplanne wat mettertyd goedgekeur sal word. Die Polisiemonument sal gebou word op die terrein van die Uniegebou waarvoor goedkeuring reeds deur die Regering verleen is. Aan die oostelike hoek van die Uniegebou is daar &#x2019;n aalwyntuin en die S.A. Polisiemonument sal in daardie tuin gebou word. Dit sal &#x2019;n amfiteater met sitplek vir ongeveer 5 000 tot 6 000 mense insluit. Dit is interessant dat die aalwyn juis die amptelike blom van die S.A. Polisie is, net soos die protea die amptelike blom van Suid-Afrika is. Ons kry nou juis die reg van die Regering om in &#x2019;n aalwyntuin die monument op te rig ter herinnering aan al die lede van die Mag wat voorheen in die Mag gedien het, vandag nog daarin dien en in die toekoms daarin sal dien.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil agb. lede bedank vir die aangename bespreking van die begrotingspos. Dit was &#x2019;n voorreg om tydens die bespreking aangeleenthede wat die S.A. Polisiemag raak, h&#x00ED;er aan te roer. Ek kan die Komitee die versekering gee dat die Mag &#x2019;n wenspan is. Met die geld wat in die begroting goedgekeur word, sal ons in die jaar wat voorl&#x00EA; ons bes doen om die Mag &#x2019;n wenspan te hou.</p>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek vra die vergunning van die halfuur.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag die agb. Minister verwelkom by hierdie geleentheid, die eerste geleentheid waar hy die Pos&#x2014;om dit so te stel&#x2014; verdedig. Hy word nogal deur twee Adjunkte bygestaan terwyl vorige agb. Ministers dit reggekry het om met net een Adjunk klaar te kom. As ek die drie van hulle so bekyk, &#x2019;n Transvaler, &#x2019;n Nataller en die agb. Minister&#x2014;self &#x2019;n Kaaplander&#x2014;lyk hulle vir my soos &#x2019;n junior Springbok-voorry. Nogtans meen ek dat ons, ten spyte van hulle grootte, met hulle sal kan afreken en ook met die res van die span wat daar oorkant sit.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Minister en sy departement ook bedank vir die stukke wat aan ons gestuur is want dit was vir ons van hulp met die ontleding van die werksaamhede van die departement. Ek verwys na die verslag van die departement vir die jaar ge&#x00EB;indig 30 September 1980, die memorandum wat versprei is saam met die begroting op die dag toe die agb. Minister van Finansies aan ons ges&#x00EA; het hoe min geld vir behuising beskikbaar was en ook die brosjure wat &#x2019;n opsomming bevat van die werksaamhede van die departement. Ek wil graag die agb. Minister vir daardie drie stukke bedank.</p>

<p>I would also like to pay a tribute to the staff of the department. It is now a department which has extended considerably. I and my colleagues have found that the members of the staff were most helpful when we had to approach them. We do not worry them too much at national level&#x2014;that is still to come&#x2014;but at regional level we have found them very helpful indeed especially in approaching them on matters regarding rent control. As far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, we will deal with him in more detail. However, I want to say that he shows a slightly greater measure of realism and sensitivity than his predecessor. I am just hoping that he is not going to be sent off to Court of St. James too soon because while Mr. Marais Steyn can get by with his Transvaal accent I do not know whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s &#x201C;Malmesbury-bry&#x201D; is going to fare quite as well in London.</p>

<p>So much for the pleasantries and the bouquets. Between myself and the Opposition team we will deal with as many of the facets of this department as we can. I want to start off by concentrating on the first priority of this department namely the housing situation. It would not be correct to say that we have a housing probleem in South Africa, but rather a housing crisis. This crisis is going to get worse and worse unless the Government changes what I believe is a totally inadequate approach to the provision of housing in this country. I say this without detracting in any way whatsoever from the work of the officials who have been trying to do their best with the very inadequate funds which have been provided for housing by the Treasury. Nor do I want to ignore the considerable progress that have been made in certain areas and in particular the provision of Coloured housing in the Cape Peninsula. My criticism therefore takes these plus factors into account as well.</p>

<p>Whites of the middle and lower income groups, especially older people and young couples starting their families, face serious problems and uncertainties in connection with their housing. That is the one area. The second one is that the townships in general, but especially the Black townships around our cities, have become tinder-box areas as a result of overcrowding and the failure of the Government to ensure that there is adequate housing at prices that the people can afford. We can see these as becoming flash-points of confrontation and violence unless the Government does something about it. The task of providing housing for our expanding population which is undergoing a process of urbanization, would be difficult in any case. I contend that it has become more difficult because of the blinker approach which this <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0368"/>Government&#x2014;and especially this department&#x2014;has towards the provision of housing.</p>

<p>I want to look at the shortcomings of Government policy and performance in the field of housing. There are seven of them and perhaps I will not have the time to elaborate on them to the extent that I would like to. The first one is the simple failure of the Government to come to terms with the scope and size of this probleem and the implications of the process of urbanization that is taking place in South Africa. There are a number of examples of the Government&#x2019;s inability to grasp the scale of the probleem and the implications of urbanization. The hon. the Deputy Minister went to Port Elizabeth the other day and made a speech in which he stated that they have built 611 000 houses over the past 20 years. That is laudable but he then goes on to say that if one ignores the national States the population of South Africa is 17 million. This means that in one generation the State has provided housing for 18,9&#x0025; of the population. I want to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that he should extend the boundaries of the national States and that will be a way to solve our housing probleem. One cannot just ignore all the national States because they are part of the total probleem of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if the hon. the Minister ignores the national States and then, having so much fewer people in the rest of South Africa, says that we have solved our housing probleem to a great extent, it is absolute nonsense. The hon. Deputy Minister has said that 611 000 houses have been built. However, the memorandum submitted by the department states that we will have to build 520 000 houses over the next 10 years just for Blacks. Adv. Mills of the Department of Cooperation and Development states that there is a shortfall of 420 000 houses for Blacks.</p>

<p>That includes the national States.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eglin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<p>We cannot exclude the national States from our overall housing projections. Mr. Knoetze of RAB states that we must have 4 million houses for Blacks in the next 20 years. The UCT Urban Problems Research Unit also states that we need 5 million low income group houses within the next 20 years. Andre Spi&#x00E8;r of Syncom says that we need 6 150 000 houses for the lower income group in the next 20 years. However inaccurate these statements may be, the fact remains that we have built 611 000 houses over the last 20 years, through funds provided by the State but we will have to do seven to ten times better in the next 20 years. When I say that, I think we will realize the scope of the probleem which lies before us. Obviously totally inadequate sums of money are being made available for housing by the central Government. One does not want to elaborate on this too much but one should read the report of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s department for last year because they mention the inadequacy of the money provided five or six times. They foresee serious implications because of the lack of funds made available to this department. The department&#x2019;s report states that they will be needing R882 million per annum for the next 10 years. However, only approximately R256 million is placed on the estimates for this purpose. As far as Black housing is concerned, the proportion is still less. However, it is quite clear that the money that is being made available by the Treasury, is a miserable amount when the scope and the scale of the probleem ahead of us is taken into account. The Treasury is only providing money for approximately 20&#x0025; of the Government&#x2019;s own estimates of what is required. I think the hon. the Minister should go back to the hon. the Minister of Finance and the Treasury. The one thing that cannot be allowed to happen is for the Treasury to look upon this department as a Cinderella department and not provide more funds. Building costs have risen by about 30&#x0025; in the last year and this means that if one looks at the estimates of what has been provided for us, the amount of money provided in real terms for housing this year is actually less than what was provided for housing last year. We on this side of the House believe that this is a disgrace.</p>

<p>The third defect in Government policy is the domination of racial dogma over common <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0369"/>sense when it comes to Government policies. One only has to look at the impact of the Group Areas Act and all the positive arguments that that side of the House will advance. The fact is, however, that tens of thousands of houses have been demolished unnecessarily. Many community services, schools and other amenities have been demolished unnecessarily just for the sake of the Group Areas Act. Hon. members describe this as slum clearance but in many instances the houses in District 6 and elsewhere as well as the schools were demolished in the interests of a racial dogma and not in the interests of slum clearance. They know that many of those houses could have been upgraded and improved. However, instead of that the bulldozers have gone in and houses have been demolished at a time when there is a severe shortage of housing in South Africa. The shortage of Black housing in the Western Cape was aggravated by a decision taken some seven or eight years ago that there should be no housing for Blacks in the Western Cape on a family basis. It has been changed now but nevertheless for six years no new housing was built in the Western Cape. In the rest of the country it was also assumed that if one only builds single quarters the flow of Blacks will go back to the rural areas. This has not worked and the result of these ideological obsessions is that the housing situation has become worse.</p>

<p>The next defect is the Government&#x2019;s stubborn adherence to orthodox building methods and standards. We can elaborate on that still further but I do not know whether I will have the time to do so. If one looks at the report of the department last year and speeches of senior officials such as the Director-General of this department and his assistants, they say time and time again that they will not lower housing standards in order to meet the housing crisis in South Africa. We believe that the circumstances which exist in South Africa will of necessity mean that to initiate people in the housing field one is going to have to adopt techniques where standards will initially be lower but where the opportunity will be given to the people themselves to start upgrading their houses. To say that people cannot enter into the housing market until they have the high standards preciously set by the National Housing Commission, just means that our housing situation is going to get worse and worse.</p>

<p>The fifth defect is the obstacles which are constantly placed in the way of homeownership. In this instance the Blacks, but also the total impact of the Group Areas Act and other things, have mitigated against a shift of emphasis from a tenant situation to a home-ownership situation in South Africa.</p>

<p>The sixth defect is the Government&#x2019;s failure so far is to devise a system which will make it possible for the private sector to play a meaningful role in the provision of low cost housing. It is quite clear that there is no way in which the State is going to be able to provide all the capital which is going to be essential for housing and even low cost housing for the next 20 years. Yet, somehow or another, in spite of the express desire of the building societies and the big institutions to become involved in house building for the lower income groups, this Government has not yet found a method whereby these people are going to be involved in an active and participatory way in the provision of housing in South Africa. There is still far too much red tape. There is once again the probleem of the Group Areas Act and the transfer of money and the securing of mortgage bonds. There is the general probleem that capital in the main is controlled by institutions which are labelled White and yet the people who require the houses are generally people who are Black, Coloured or Indian. The Government has not yet found a solution to that probleem.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the constant feuding and disagreement that is obvious between the Department of Community Development on the one hand and the Department of Cooperation and Development on the other in respect of an overall housing policy for South Africa. Time and time again one finds statements by Mr. Mills, the Director-General of the Department of Co-operation and Development, who states that we must shift on a massive basis to self-help housing, core housing and controlled squatting. Mr. Timo Bezuidenhout, Chief Commissioner for the Western Cape, has expressed the same sentiments. The hon. the Minister of Co-operation and Development has announced a new housing strategy in Parliament which include controlled squatting and a site-and-service scheme. Yet, in spite of <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0370"/>that the hon. the Deputy Minister stood up in the House a few days later and said that no expert could indicate any advantages of this approach. At a conference held in Port Elizabeth the other day, the Director-General of this department once again opposed the introduction of new methods and any lowering of standards. There is a conflict and I believe that this conflict should be resolved because we cannot have two important departments each concerned with housing where one is arguing in one direction and the other is stubbornly clinging to the old-fashioned approach towards housing in South Africa. We accordingly believe that there must be some sorting out of differences, policy and performance by these two departments.</p>

<p>From that I want to switch to the question of low cost housing. As the hon. the Minister is aware I made a statement on this in the course of the budget debate and it is not my intention to cover all the ground as hon. members on this side of the House will also touch on this matter. As far as low cost housing is concerned there were four essential features which had to be tackled by the Government. First of all the State had to provide more money. It had to provide money which shows some relation to the size and the scale of the probleem. Secondly, the Government has to be prepared to make extensive use of controlled site-and-service schemes, core housing and self-build schemes to supplement the orthodox building methods which we have adopted in the past. Thirdly the Government must swing the accent of policy away from tenant letting schemes towards individual home-ownership schemes at all levels within the population. Finally, the Government must remove the restrictions making it impossible for the private sector from playing its full role in the financing of low cost housing. Those were the four essential elements which we found. They were defects which we argued should be changed as far as the Government&#x2019;s approach to low cost housing is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to direct the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention more particularly on this occasion to the probleem of the White middle and lower income groups in the cities. Many retired people, pensioners, widows and widowers live on relatively fixed incomes such as pensions, annuities and interest on savings. These people are finding themselves in a desperate financial situation. They live in fear of another increase in rental which they know they will not be able to afford. They see their living standards dropping and they see no alternative accommodation available for them. The reasons for this&#x2014;as the hon. the Minister may know&#x2014;are the reduction in the number of letting-units available as a result of the lifting of rent control and the sectional titles scheme. It is also due to a rise in the building costs of more than 30&#x0025; in the past year. It is also due to an increase in the interests rate on mortgage bonds which on 1 October this year will have risen by 33&#x2153;&#x0025; in one year. If one adds to that the increase in the building costs, it means that if one buys a house now the interest charges will be 80&#x0025; more than they were at the end of September last year. Furthermore the capital structure of property in the flatland areas has changed as a result of it now being based, not on the ownership of multi-unit seller schemes but on the basis of single-unit schemes. Therefore a block of flats which was capitalized at R1 million before is not capitalized at a figure of R2 million of R2,5 million. The impact of that is that the whole capital structure changes and that the rental structure changes as well. Finally, no new flats are being built by the private sector for letting purposes in South Africa. That is the situation and it is going to become serious unless the Government does something about it.</p>

<p>Who are the two groups of people affected by this? First of all there are the people who qualify for assistance under the Housing Act, in other words, single people with an income of less than R360 and if they are married, less than R650. Some of these people, in practice, are assisted and some are protected. Some of them have accommodation in homes for the aged. However, the hon. the Minister knows that there is a serious shortage for accommodation of White aged people in the low income group. Secondly, some of these people are assisted through the National Housing Commission. Once again the hon. the Minister knows that there is not enough accommodation on that basis. He knows that in the Cape, for instance, his department had to contact the Cape Town city council. The following headline appeared in <i>Die Burger:</i> &#x201C;Groot <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0371"/>Woningnood in Kaapse Wit Buurte&#x201D;. The department approached the city council and asked them whether they will build more houses for people in this income group. The city council has said they are not going to build it but still the Government has changed the rental formula because on the basis of the present rental formula one cannot build a house by public tender and still let it to people who have incomes of less than R650 per month. That is the reality. Some other people are accommodated in pre-October 1949 rent controlled properties but the hon. the Minister knows that this is a reducing number. The number of those units is reducing as they are upgraded and they become available to wealthier people rather than poorer people. Some of these people are protected because they did occupy rent controlled premises which have been deproclaimed and in respect of which rent control has now been removed. The hon. the Minister knows, however, that even that small and dwindling number of people are subject to severe pressures and forms of harassment as people try to get them out. He knows that in spite of the protection, the rentals are rising as even under rent control allowances must be made for free market enterprise rentals that are shooting up among them. Many people accordingly cannot find any accommodation in homes for the aged. Many people have no assistance in practice from national housing schemes. Many people in this category do not live in rent controlled blocks and many people do not have the protection of rent control because they were not lucky enough to live in one of these blocks at the time that rent control was lifted. Unless the Government can provide accommodation for these people, they have no option but to pay direct rental subsidies to these people so that they can live in accommodation provided for them by the private sector.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the next category of people and that is the category with incomes above R650 per month and below R1 000, in other words, people who do not qualify for assistance but nevertheless have grave difficulty in withstanding the economic pressures of inflation exist in the property field today. There is nobody at the moment to look after them. These are primarily elderly people who have retired on pensions, annuities or savings. On the other hand there may be young people wanting to start a family. They are being priced out of the housing market. Young people simply cannot afford to buy or build a house taking building costs and interest rates into account. They are, therefore, being priced right out of the housing market. They are being squeezed out of flats because rentals have increased sharply or the flats are being sold under the Sectional Titles Act. This, therefore, is the category of people, people who are not poor but just the ordinary average middle class person, old or young, who is finding themselves in a &#x201C;knyptangbeweging&#x201D; because of the lack of buying power of money and of increased rentals. The hon. the Minister has warned against exploitation and I think it is correct that he should do so. His department has on occasions called landlords in, sometimes because the hon. the Minister said they should and other times from pressure of members of the Opposition who said it was about time that something should be done. In many of these instances there was a voluntary reduction of rentals although, naturally, that voluntary reduction was done in the knowledge that rent control could be reimposed if it had not taken place. That is not good enough.</p>

<p>I want to suggest three areas in which the Minister should act in respect of this group of people whose income vary from R650 to R1 000 per month. Firstly the hon. the Minister must act to relieve the burden of the interest rates on mortgage bonds. There are five ways in which he can do it. He can raise the income and property value of the National Housing Scheme and, likewise, the levels mentioned in the Housing Act so that more people can qualify for assisted housing in South Africa. He must raise it above the level of R650 per month so that more people can qualify. He can pay allowances to reduce the level interest paid on mortgage bonds. There was a time two or three years ago when anybody with a mortgage bond on a house up to R18 000 were subsidized to the extent of 2&#x0025;. That kind of provision must be reintroduced. Thirdly he must provide income tax deductions in respect of interest payments on mortgage bonds up to a certain income or capital level. Fourthly, the hon. the Minister and the leaders of the building society movement must put their heads <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0372"/>together and consider two new schemes namely the introduction of graded or deferred repayments of loans and the interest thereon so that repayments could increase as the mortgagee&#x2019;s income rises and his family commitments reduce. It should accordingly be graded so it can be done in a more realistic way in relation to income. Secondly, he should consider the introduction of equity sharing schemes where building societies take up part of the initial building cost and they will then get an equivalent part of the capital appreciation when that is realized. These are the practical things that should be done to ease the burden of the high interest rates.</p>

<p>He must also take positive steps to encourage the private sector to build flats for letting. We can all make money from selling sectional title units but we are talking of letting to people falling within the R650 to R1 000 per month group. What he has to do is to introduce the concept of depreciation allowances to make it economically possible to do this. I believe he will have to think in terms of incentives for companies that are prepared to build houses of flats for this middle income group in the cities either by way of tax incentives on annual income or by way of tax incentives in respect of any capital gains that might accrue when that property is sold. He should also think in terms of State-assisted low interest rate loans because this is going to be essential to make this a viable economic proposition. Finally, in view of the tense situation that exists among the entrepreneurs as far as rent control is concerned, I think there should be some guarantee to these new investors that rent control would not be applied to them in the future. I think it is an essential psychological barrier that should be breached and something that is especially necessary since the hon. the Minister breached the October 1966 date when he imposed rent control on properties which had never before been rent controlled.</p>

<p>A new look should also be taken at the development of the housing utility companies in the field of multi-unit housing in South Africa. I say this because there is provision in terms of the Companies Act of 1946 because section 21 provides for the registering of a company or an association &#x201C;not for profit&#x201D;. In other words, that company has to re-invest whatever profit it makes into the object of the company. I believe that there is tremendous scope in South Africa for action by such housing utility companies in the fields of middle and lower income group housing. When we look at the history in South Africa in contrast with Europe and elsewhere it scarcely exists. In the United Kingdom there are 3 000 housing associations, in the Netherlands there are 900 of these associations, yet in the Cape Peninsula we have only five which include the Ulluntu Housing Utility Company which was established by the Urban Foundation. Garden Cities is the prime example of what can be achieved by a housing utility company. This company starting with a capital of &#x00A3;10 000 and a tract of land in the Uitvlugt forest and has been able to build many houses and flats. It has been a pace-setter for housing in the Cape Peninsula. These companies are not part of bureaucracy, they have access to the money facilities of the private enterprise, they are exempt from income tax and have to plough back their profits into housing itself. The Government should take the initiative and take a bold step forward together with the building societies in South Africa to try to develop housing utility companies as one of the instruments with which to try to meet the problems of the middle income group who live in the cities of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, voordat ek op die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Seepunt reageer, meen ek dat dit van belang is dat hierdie Komitee moet kennis neem van die gerasionaliseerde Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling. Die rasionalisasieproses is bykans voltooi wat die departement betref en die departement is nou saamgestel uit vyf voormalige departemente t.w. die ou Departement van Gemeenskapsbou, die Departement van Openbare Werke, die Departement van Omgewingsbeplanning en Energie en die Departement van Landboukrediet en Grondbesit en Justisie is almal saamgevoeg in een oorkoepelende departement wat vanaf 1 Julie 1981 bekend staan as die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling. Die departement is verder onderverdeel in ses Direktorate wat elkeen verband hou met &#x2019;n diversiteit van funksies van die <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0373"/>Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling. Di&#x00E9; gerasionaliseerde departement soos dit nou saamgestel is, is, in alle beskeiden-heid, die beste instrument in die hand van die agb. Minister om die prim&#x00EA;re funksie van die departement uit te voer t.w. die skepping van &#x2019;n geo-flsiese lewensruimte waarbinne gebalanseerde en volwaardige gemeen-skappe vir alle bevolkingsgroepe gestig kan word en kan ontwikkel.</p>

<p>Ek verkeer in &#x2019;n ietwat moeilike situasie waar ek moet reageer op die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Seepunt. Ek het probeer om notas en aantekeninge te maak vir die doeleindes van konstruktiewe debatvoering om op die agb. lid se toespraak te antwoord. Toe ek egter by die 17de punt kom, besef ek dat in die tydsbestek tot my beskikking ek hoegenaamd nie al die punte kan dek nie. Toe ek die punte so deurkyk is dit inderdaad so dat nie een van die sake waarna die agb. lid verwys het ons nie reeds van bewus is nie en is die agb. Minister of die departement besig om konstruktief daaraan aandag te skenk. Om hierdie punt te staaf, gaan ek net konsentreer op die kwessie van behuising en veral laekostebehuising. Ek wil graag die volgende prentjie vir die agb. lid vir Seepunt skilder. Die agb. Minister en die departement is daarvan bewus dat daar &#x2019;n agter-stand is sover dit laekostebehuising betref en dit is trouens in die orde van 250 000 een-hede. Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad is ook daarvan bewus dat&#x2014;gegrond op toekomstige projeksies&#x2014;daar 2 800 miljoen een-hede gebou moet word teen &#x2019;n geraamde jaarlikse koste&#x2014;wat deur &#x2019;n parlement&#x00EA;re bewilliging gedek moet word&#x2014;van R508 miljoen. Ons is dus wel deeglik bewus van die akute posisie m.b.t. die tekort aan laekostebehuising. Nadat ek hierdie prentjie geskilder het, wil ek dit boekstaaf dat hierdie agb. Minister of die departement nog nooit afsydig gestaan het teenoor die behuisingsbe-hoeftes van alle bevolkingsgroepe in Suid-Afrika nie. Die departement se rekord bewys dit. Indien hierdie departement van genoeg fondse voorsien kan word, kan hy met sy gesonde behuisingsbeleid hierdie saak stelselmatig afwerk en ontwikkel. Vanaf 1970 tot vandag is daar teen &#x2019;n koste van R1 500 biljoen 218 000 eenhede gebou. Sedert die instelling van &#x2019;n finale sentrale kapitaalbron vir laekostebehuising is R2 800 miljoen bestee aan die voorsiening van bykans 800 000 eenhede. Dit is die rekord van die departement en dit onderstreep die feit dat wat laekostebehuising betref, die departement met sy gesonde behuisingsbeleid nie &#x2019;n tree sal terugstaan om in die akute behoefte te voorsien nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dit is goed om te kritiseer, maar ons almal is bewus van die posisie. Ek neem hom sy benadering kwalik. Laat hom met &#x2019;n konstruktiewe bydrae kom om die posisie te verlig. [Tussenwerpsels.] Laat my net verder gaan. Die voorstelle wat die agb. lid vir Seepunt gedoen het, is aan ons goed bekend. Die huidige posisie is egter sodanig dat die Staat nie op sy eie in die huidige behuisingsbehoeftes kan voorsien nie en daar dus &#x2019;n gekonsentreerde totale behuisingstrategie ingestel moet word waarby die Staat, die private sektor en ook die individu wat behuis moet word, betrokke moet wees. Dit sal gedoen moet word as ons die behuisings probleem enigsins wil oplos.</p>

<p>Die agb. Minister het ernstig met hierdie kant van die Raad gepraat want hy is bewus van die behuisingstekort. Hy het vir ons ges&#x00EA; ons moet met konstruktiewe voorstelle met betrekking tot &#x2019;n totale behuisingstrategie na die debat kom. Kollegas van my wat aan die debat gaan deelneem, byvoorbeeld die agb. lede vir Vasco, Witbank en Algoa, sal almal kom met voorstelle om hierdie probleematiek te ondervang om die een belangrike rede dat, soos die agb. Minister vir ons ges&#x00EA; het, ongeag die konstitusionele of staatkundige bedelings wat in die newels van die toekoms versluier is, hierdie staatkundige modelie gebaseer moet wees op &#x2019;n geordende gemeenskapslewe, en in &#x2019;n geordende gemeenskapslewe is behuising die sentrale komponent. Dit is verder sodanig van belang dat, soos ek reeds in &#x2019;n vorige debat ges&#x00EA; het, die toekoms van Suid-Afrika onder meer in en rondom ons stede beslis sal word. Die kwaliteit van lewe is in hierdie verband van besondere belang en behuising is weer eens &#x2019;n sentrale komponent in hierdie hele opset.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid se hele toespraak was daarop gemik om die probleematiek in di&#x00E9; verband by hierdie kant van die Raad tuis te bring, maar ons is wel deeglik daarvan bewus.</p>

Dit is tyd dat ons die verstedelikings probleem baie sterker oor-weeg want dit plaas &#x2019;n onbetaamlike las op die reeds bestaande infrastruktuur in die stedelike komplekse.

<p>Ek wil op die begroting as sodanig terugkom. Ek wil die begroting bespreek teen die agtergrond van &#x2019;n uitspraak van niemand anders nie as die agb. Eerste Minister self. By geleentheid van &#x2019;n intemasionale konferensie insake behuising in September 1979 in Kaapstad het hy die volgende ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of what has already been achieved, housing and community development remain an uncompleted task and every generation will have to carry out its quite considerable duty in this regard.

<p>As ons na die begroting as sodanig kyk, sien ons dat daar in die huidige boekjaar R256 miljoen vir besteding aan behuising voorsien word. Hierdie bedrag bestaan uit, eerstens, &#x2019;n parlement&#x00EA;re bewilliging van R98 miljoen en, tweedens, die terugkerende kapitaal na die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds van R80 miljoen en &#x2019;n rentevrystelling van R77 miljoen. Daarbenewens is daar as eerste las onder die Begrotingspos &#x2019;n bedrag van R165 miljoen, synde &#x2019;n lening wat die Tesourie aangegaan het om die ekonomie te stimuleer. In 1976-&#x2019;77 is hierdie geld van &#x2019;n konsortium van banke geleen en aan die Departement van Gemeenskapsbou beskikbaar gestel om behuising te voorsien.</p>

<p>Dit was nie net vir Swart behuising nie. Ek het nagegaan wat die posisie tien jaar gelede was en gevind dat die parlement&#x00EA;re bewilliging vir behuising toe R71 miljoen beloop het. Ek het hierdie syfers toe aan &#x2019;n senior ekonoom van &#x2019;n groot nasionale maatskappy wat in die behuisingsituasie spesialiseer, voorgel&#x00EA; en hom gevra om asseblief vir my uit te werk hoeveel geld vandag beskikbaar gemaak sal moet word om dieselfde aantal huise te bou as wat in 1971 gebou is. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat indien in die boekjaar 1981-&#x2019;82 dieselfde aantal huise gebou moet word as wat daar in 1971-&#x2019;72 met R71 miljoen gebou is, dit vandag R274 miljoen sal kos. Dit moet dan vergelyk word met die bedrag van R256 miljoen wat vanjaar beskikbaar gestel word. Dit kom dus voor asof die bewilliging en ander bedrae nouliks verband hou met &#x2026;</p>

<p>Dit is presies die punt wat ek wil maak. Wat die befondsing vir behuising in die begroting betref, is ons in werklikheid vandag niks beter daaraan toe as in 1971 nie. Dit is die punt wat ek wil maak. Ek wil dit aan die Komitee stel dat dit &#x2019;n onhoudbare posisie is. Dit moet in die kort termyn reggestel word en dit kan op verskeie wyses gedoen word. Eerstens moet die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds leningsmagte kry om op die kapitale mark fondse te bekom om die akute behuisingstoestand die hoof te kan bied. Die sentrale sekuriteitsoorweging van die individu is behuising, vervoer en kommunikasie. As die S.A. Spoorwee leningsmagte kan kry en as Evkom leningsmagte kan kry, kan ek nie sien hoekom die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds dit nie ook kan kry nie. Dan wat die bedrag van R165 miljoen as eerste las op die departement betref, moet dit afgeskryf word. Dit is nie die departement se verant-woordelikheid nie, maar dit is die verant-woordelikheid van die Tesourie. Derdens moet die rentesubsidie wat die Staat aan die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds gee, afgeskaf word. Wat parlement&#x00EA;re bewilliging betref, betaal geen departement rente op die geld wat die Staat vir hom beskikbaar maak nie. Ek wil die agb. Minister vra om dit in hier-die verband te oorweeg om verto&#x00EB; tot die Tesourie te rig om hierdie rente te beskou as die Staat se bydrae om die probleematiek van laekostebehuising op te los.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. WATTERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, at the outset I should like to add my congratulations to those of the official Opposition for the good work that has been done by the Department of Community Development. I think that anybody who was to say that it has not made magnificent efforts over the last year or two would be quite unreasonable. However, in spite of these magnificent efforts, I think it is very necessary also to bear in mind the fact that we do have major problems and that there are areas in respect of which its efforts have perhaps not been as successful as they have been in other areas. I think it must be borne in mind that the Department of Community Development is, so far as the public is concerned, one of the more important departments. It is, as I see it, one of the three departments of key value to the general public. Obviously, the public require food, security and housing. On those three pillars a successful society will be based.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the department is in my opinion up against a very, very tough probleem. Regrettably, from the outbreak of the war in 1939 until as late as 1960 there was not the attention given to the building of houses for all sections of the community that there might have been. Immediately after the cessation of hostilities there were a lot of returning ex-servicemen and, as a consequence, White housing was put in hand to some degree and a fair amount of leeway was made up in this direction, but so far as Indian, Coloured and Black housing is concerned, I think it can honestly be said that only very casual efforts were made until about 1960 in this field. There were efforts made in various degrees, but nothing comparable to the efforts that have been made since 1960. As a consequence, the department then had to make up what virtually amounted to a 20-year backlog. It has now had 20 years in which to make it up, but of course it has not been able even to touch the probleem because of the ever growing birthrate which in fact exceeds the rate at which houses can be built. So the department does have a probleem. I think all the members in the House do sincerely want to resolve these problems. I do not think that the hon. the Minister and his department are callous of the welfare of the various communities as regards homes. Of course they are not. I believe that the hon. members on this side of the House are not merely criticizing for the sake of criticizing. I believe that we all have the same objective in view, viz. the provision of houses. It is merely a question of whether one side or the other has the right ideas or whether in fact between us we can think up ideas to help one another&#x2014;obviously the Government will ultimately have to put them into effect.</p>

<p>The hon. member who spoke just before me said it was all very well criticizing, but what about constructive ideas. Although the hon. member for Sea Point and I do not necessarily agree on many things, he did put forward quite a number of what I would also consider to be very constructive ideas in respect <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0376"/>of housing. The question of, for example, core units is one which I know the department has considered in the past. In another capacity I have sat in on meetings with the Director-General of this department and we have discussed quite a number of possibilities, but unfortunately it seems that the department, in the past at any rate, has been somewhat opposed to this concept. Similarly, the concept of site-and-service schemes has been strenuously opposed over a very long period. Whether one likes it or not, I am sorry to say that, whether one has idealistic tendencies or not, idealism is not going to provide houses in the quantities we want. That is the crux of the matter. It cannot be done in that way. I would like to suggest, as a plain and simple constructive idea, that one should go on with various types of schemes&#x2014;site-and-service schemes, core housing, plus all the others that have been suggested&#x2014;and leave the existing squatter camps where they are until such time as one has built new places into which to move those people. One should allow those squatter camps as transit camps if necessary. The reason why I say this is that if one studies the figures provided in the various documents presented to hon. members, one finds that a very, very large percentage of the houses that have been built are merely to accommodate people being moved from one area to another. Although the department has done a magnificent job&#x2014;that is something I freely admit&#x2014;in providing huge numbers of houses, particularly over the last few years, it has not been effective in that so much of that housing has been taken up by people being moved from one area to another, from squatter camps to other places, and so forth. These are, I think, some of the ideas that must be borne in mind with the future provision of housing.</p>

<p>Again, I think it must be borne in mind that many of these people who live in informal housing&#x2014;squatter camps or call them what you will&#x2014;-cannot in fact afford to live in ordinary accommodation. In provincial government&#x2014;I am sorry to bring up again where I was previously&#x2014;we had a body called the Development and Services Board which was under my control and in the area concerned we had a great number of these squatter camps. Although we did not like them, the Development and Services Board accepted the fact that it was unrealistic to throw everyone out. We merely provided water, saw to it that reasonable sewerage services were available and had health inspectors go around there from time to time to see that basic health conditions were not totally intolerable. We knew that those squatter camps were not desirable, but there was no acceptable alternative. The alternative was the sort of unpleasantness the Government has had to endure over places like Nyanga, Crossroads and so forth. I know that in many of these places action was taken with the best of intentions and that there was no <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the people who wanted this action taken. They believed there should be better accommodation provided, but is it &#x201C;better accommodation&#x201D; to throw them out when they have nowhere to go or to leave them in the semi-squalor they are in? I submit that it is better to leave them in semi-squalor until one has something better, rather than to throw them out.</p>

<p>The priorities sometimes do rather perturb me. When one goes through the documents provided, one sees that there is a terrific amount of building in progress for which the department is in one way or another responsible. When one finds that the capital required to build facilities for the prisons, the Police, the military and so forth comes to an amount in the region of R137 million to R138 million while in respect of old people there are only a couple of million rand provided in the estimates, one does perhaps wonder whether such priorities are desirable. I know that security is one of the pillars on which a society rests and one does have to provide facilities in this regard, but I cannot help but feel that there is too great a disparity in the figures that have been given for this year.

<p>I thank the hon. member. As I have said, there is far too great a disparity in these figures, especially when one finds elsewhere in the estimates another sum amounting to a couple of million rand&#x2014;please do not misunderstand me here&#x2014;to provide homes for five members <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0377"/>of the President&#x2019;s Council and for half a dozen Deputy Ministers. Please do not think that I am an egalitarian to the extent that I believe that everybody should live in &#x201C;pon-dokkies&#x201D;. I believe that the State President, the Prime Minister and the Ministers should live in decent homes, but when one sees that a sum as large as R2 million is being provided for these 12 homes, it does strike one as being an excessively large sum and one cannot help but feel that a little more modesty could well have been borne in mind.</p>

<p>I should like to say that I am fully in favour of our dignitaries in office having adequate homes. Since they have to do public entertaining, quite obviously they have to have facilities worthy of our country; but, as I have said, I cannot help but feel that, when the pensioner who is battling to make ends meet, sees this kind of expenditure, he must think: &#x201C;Well, hell&#x201D;&#x2014;I am sorry, Mr. Chairman&#x2014;&#x201C;this is a little bit rough.&#x201D; I feel that one could therefore be a little more modest. In any event, how can one reconcile statements that there is a shortage of money with this sort of activity and these standards?</p>

<p>One other point I should like to touch on before I close is the question of the land which has been taken over by the Department of Community Development for urban renewal. I refer specifically to the blocks of land known as AK and G in Durban. I notice on page 24 of the summary of the activities of the department, para. 525, that it is said that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Complete urban renewal is a timeconsuming process and in some cases it may be a whole decade before the area is rebuilt.</block>

<p>Having served on the Durban City Council in the early 1960s when the department had already acquired a very large portion of blocks AK and G, I find this a very long decade&#x2014;that is all I can say. In the meantime, as the department does not pay rates on the land it has acquired, these huge areas of Durban&#x2014;they are huge, Sir!&#x2014;have for all practical purposes been non-productive to the city. What is even more to the point and what is worse is that this is prime land in the old borough of Durban and would be highly desirable for commercial, light industrial and, more important, residential purposes. The population of Durban has been spreading further and further out to the extent that the transport system is breaking down. The Railways, I suppose, do their best, but there are very few inter-town transport services. The result is that transportation by motorcar has become excessively heavy and the whole city is grinding to a halt through congestion. Now, as I have said, there are huge areas there which could be brought into productive use. I know the argument has been that there must be complete replanning, but I want to suggest in all humility that 20 years is a long time, and it is more than 20 years since the urban renewal started in that area.</p>

<p>The area of Cato Manor is another such huge area. I think the area comprises approximately 3 000 ha. I am given to understand that the planning in this regard has been done once or twice over in this period, partly by the City Council and partly by the department. This area was declared White and the Indians were moved out. There was a reason for this. I am not quarrelling with the original reasoning, because it was an appalling slum. It has however been cleared for many, many years now. A year or so ago agreement was reached that possibly the Indian community could go back to that area. I should like to know just what is going on with that area, because it is another massive area in Durban close to the centre of the city which is non-productive and non-rate-producing.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voor-sitter, die agb. lid vir Umbilo stel sy saak op so &#x2019;n wyse dat &#x2019;n mens amper met hom saamstem. Gewoonlik is sy bydraes ook baie konstruktief. Waar ek egter nie met hom of met die agb. lid vir Seepunt kan saamstem nie, is wanneer dit kom by &#x201C;site-and-service schemes&#x201D;. Ek het as jong man in my studies baie met Johannesburg se stadsraad te doen gehad en het self ook as &#x2019;n lid van die raad gedien. Ek het gesien wat plekke soos die ou Sophiatown van kinders gemaak het. Ek het ook in Kaapstad dikwels kom kyk na plekke soos Bishop Lavis en gesien dat die kind wat <span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0378"/>in &#x2019;n slum grootword, &#x2019;n slumkind is en dat hy nooit ho&#x00EB;r tradisies nastrewe as wat sy pa gehad het nie.</p>

<p>The hon. member will agree with me that a Zulu hut in a Zulu community is a much better place for a child to grow up in than a slum area. This is a point I wanted to make. What is furthermore important today is that the cost of services is nearly half of the cost of low-cost housing. Therefore, you do not solve any probleem by means of site and service schemes, on account of the cost of services.</p>

<p>Daardie agb. lid moet my nie vandag in die rede val nie; ek voel nie lus daarvoor nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ons het in die afge-lope jare van Regeringskant seker die mees skouspelagtigste behuisingsprojekte sien verrys, projekte soos Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. &#x2019;n Mens kan die totale bevolking van Ysland in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain huisves, en daardie projek is in &#x2019;n paar jaar voltooi. Die totale Blanke bevolking van Rhodesi&#x00EB; kan in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain geplaas word, en dit het net &#x2019;n paar jaar geneem om Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain te bou. Dan is daar menige kleiner projekte wat uniek is in w&#x00EA;reldbouprogramme. Maar, Meneer, nieteenstaande al die prestasies met behuising van Regeringskant, los dit nie ons behuisingsprobleme op nie. Dit word huidig beraam dat ons oor die volgende twee jaar een van die grootste behuisingstekorte in die geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika sal binnegaan. Dit kan beskryf word as &#x2019;n behuisings-of voorsieningsprobleem; andersyds is dit suiwer &#x2019;n ekonomiese probleem. Daar kan nie deur diegene wat die behuising benodig, genoegsaam betaal word vir dit wat hulle bewoon nie, en die Regering kan nie volhou om subsidies te betaal in dieselfde mate waarin dit tans gegee word nie. Een van die groot redes vir die tekort aan erwe, huise en woonstelle is sekerlik daaraan te wyte dat die privaatdorpstigter hom aan dorpstigting onttrek het.</p>

<p>Meneer, in die afgelope tyd het ons baie mense gekry, deskundiges, wat by wyse van wiskundige berekenings die tekort aan behuising wil bepaal. Baie van hierdie mense se uitsprake, ook in hierdie Raad, besorg aan Gemeenskapsbou meer probleme as wat dit oplos. Hulle stel net die probleme, maar &#x2019;n probleem is gewoonlik &#x2019;n saak waarvan jy nie genoeg weet nie&#x2014;sodra jy genoeg kennis het, verdwyn die probleem en is die saak makliker oplosbaar. Tans is dit so dat baie van die deskundiges die departement veroordeel, en by baie ander mense wat goedge-sind teenoor die departement moet optree, &#x2019;n soort argwaan laat ontstaan. Wat vandag werklik nodig is, is mense wat die praktyk ken, mense wat self dorpstigters was. Hier dink ek aan mense soos die Teuns Besters, die Piet Vosloo&#x2019;s en ingenieurs soos H. B. Malan van Kaapstad, wat met die praktiese situasies van dorpstigting vertroud is.</p>

<p>Nou kan &#x2019;n mens jouself afvra waarom die privaatdorpstigters die terrein van dorpstigting verlaat het. Daarom wil ek kortliks die proses van dorpstigting verduidelik. In die Republiek van Suid-Afrika het elk van die vier provinsies sy eie ordonnansies wat dorpstigting beheer. Hierdie ordonnansies verskil van mekaar, en verder word elke ordonnansie verskillend deur verskillende plaaslike besture ge&#x00EF;nterpreteer. Di&#x00E9; ordonnansies is gedurende die dertigerjare uitgeroep. Oor-spronklik is dit deur almal aanvaar dat die openbare dienste in n dorp of in &#x2019;n dorp wat gestig moet word uitsluitlik die verantwoor-delikheid van &#x2019;n plaaslike bestuur is. Die plaaslike besture het dan dienste gefinansier uit lenings, en hierdie lenings is terugbetaal uit die heffings op handelsdienste, naamlik water, elektrisiteit en riolering. Die dorpstigters self het paaie en stormwaterdreinering verskaf. Dit het meegebring dat &#x2019;n lening binne 10 tot 15 jaar terugbetaal is. Hierdie metode het veroorsaak dat die pryse van erwe oor die jare konstant gebly het.</p>

<p>Met die groot aanvraag na behuising gedurende die sestigerjare het plaaslike besture finansi&#x00EB;le probleme ondervind om die dorpe se dienste te finansier. Hierdie dienste kon nie soos voorheen so maklik gefinansier word nie, want die aanvraag was te groot. Nou het die plaaslike besture van die dorp-stigter volle betaling vir die dienste ge&#x00EB;is, maar nog voortgegaan om dieselfde heffings op handelsdienste te plaas. Dit het meegebring dat die nuwe metode van finansiering die prys van &#x2019;n erf met tussen R3 000 en R4 000 verhoog het. Plaaslike besture het nou dien-steverskaffing gebruik as &#x2019;n bron van eie <span class="col_711-712" refersTo="page_0379"/>finansiering, en sodoende die prys van erwe die hoogte laat inskiet.</p>

<p>Tans kan die Minister getuig dat die prys van dienste soms soveel as 45&#x0025; van die koste van &#x2019;n huis uitmaak, en dit is &#x2019;n saak wat toenemend kommer wek. Die Niemand-kommissie het finansiering van dienste as &#x2019;n probleem uitgesonder. So ook het die Fou-ch&#x00E9;-kommissie die dienste en die finansiering daarvan as probleme van dorpstigting ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer. Tog sit ons vandag nog son-der &#x2019;n oplossing. Ek doen vandag &#x2019;n beroep op die agb. Minister van Gemeenskapsont-wikkeling om die stigting van &#x2019;n metropoli-taanse diensorganisasie vir die verskaffing van dienste te laat ondersoek. So &#x2019;n liggaam sal die totale verskaffing van dienste vir dorpstigting onderneem. So &#x2019;n organisasie kan geskoei word op die lees van die Randse Waterraad of die Natalse Waterkommissie, of Evkom, wanneer dit kom by die voorsiening van elektrisiteit, met die vereiste dat di&#x00E9; liggaam nie net verantwoordelik is vir die grootmaatverskaffing van dienste nie, maar ook vir verskaffing tot by die uiteindelike verbruiker.</p>

<p>Finansies vir sulke dienste sal van die Tesourie verkry moet word, wat net soos in die geval van die munisipaliteite &#x2019;n handels-heffing op die dienste kan plaas. Dit sal beteken dat die prys van erwe onmiddellik sal daal. Die standaarde en die materiaal sal deur die metropolitaanse diensorganisasie voorgeskryf word, wat sal verhoed dat onrealistiese standaarde vir dorpe voorgeskryf word.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil aan die agb. Minister s&#x00EA; dat die grootste probleem in die voorsiening van behuising tans is, en in die toekoms ook sal wees, die verskaffing van dienste, en daarom behoort daar voortdurend gewerk te word aan die billike voorsiening daarvan. Mnr. die Voorsitter, &#x2019;n mens moet net in ag neem dat in sommige gevalle in Johannesburg dienste vir &#x2019;n kommersi&#x00EB;le dorp vandag tot R30 000 per perseel kos. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BARNARD</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek bedank die agb. lid vir die geleent-heid.</p>

<p>Wanneer &#x2019;n mens in ag neem dat sulke dienste tot R30 000 in die geval van &#x2019;n kommersi&#x00EB;le perseel kos, dan kan jy nie anders as begin insien dat iemand algeheel sal moet optree om dienste te verskaf, en dat dit nie aan die plaaslike besture, wat elkeen die wet verskillend interpreteer, oorgelaat kan word nie.</p>

<p>Dan is daar &#x2019;n ander vraag wat ek vanmiddag aan die agb. Minister wil stel. Ek verneem graag van die agb. Minister wanneer die Indi&#x00EB;r-en Kleurlinggesinne wat onwettig in Mayfair-Oos woon, verwyder gaan word. Ek vra verder dat die agb. Minister die Huurwet van toepassing sal maak op elke gebou waar daar onwettige okkupasie deur anderskleuriges plaasvind. Meneer, ek verteenwoordig mense wat in die laer-en mid-delinkomstegroepe is. Hierdie mense word tydig en ontydig uit huise gesit wat hulle binne die wet okkupeer. Verder gebeur dit dat mense wat nie omgee om diegene wat nie huise het, uit te buit nie, Indi&#x00EB;rs sleutel-geld laat betaal vir die huise wat hulle bewoon. Dit is verkeerd om iemand uit te buit as hy nie behuising het nie, en dit is wat met Indi&#x00EB;rs en Kleurlinge in hierdie gebied gedoen word. Maar in dieselfde proses word mense wat wettiglik daar is op straat gesit. Agb. lede het almal gepraat van die probleme wat die laer-en middelinkomste-groepe ondervind. Dit is juis ook van toepassing in my kiesafdeling.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander aangeleentheid wat ek al voorheen met die agb. Minister bespreek het. In hierdie verband was die agb. Minister en sy departement baie behulpsaam gewees. Ek verwys na die geval van Crown Gardens, waar huise aan die mense daar te koop aangebied is. Oor die afgelope jare het die stadsraad van Johannesburg baie probleme in hierdie verband voorsien, omdat vuur-mure tussenin&#x2014;wat ons &#x201E;fire-walls&#x201D; noem&#x2014; gebou moet word, en omdat die onderverdeling van hierdie huise moet plaasvind, maar ek meen eerlikwaar dat hulle te lank met hierdie saak gesloer het. Reeds in 1976 is die besluit in hierdie Raad geneem dat daardie huise aan die mense van Crown Gardens be-skikbaar gestel moet word.</p>

<p>Verder, Meneer, wil ek die agb. Minister bedank vir dit wat hy en sy departement oor die afgelope jare vir behuising gedoen het. Ek wil aan hom s&#x00EA;: Moet tog nooit probeer om die Opposisie tevrede te stel nie. Dit is <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0380"/>my ondervinding dat hoe meer daar gegee word, hoe meer hulle soek na daardie klein sakies en na mense wat kla oor niks. As ons die plakkers probleem opgelos het, sal daar gekla word, soos daar vandag gekla is, oor die beter behuising vir Ministers, of vir een of ander amptenaar. Daar sal daaroor gekla word. Die agb. lid vir Umbilo moet my dit tog nie verkwalik as ek aan hom dit s&#x00EA; nie: I always wanted to live in a house such as the ones in which the members of the Executive Committee of Natal live. They look so cosy, the surroundings are so lovely and the houses are so well built. I am sure that when the hon. member thinks back on those houses, he must admit that they were beautifully built.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voor-sitter, ek wil die agb. lid vir Langlaagte gelukwens met &#x2019;n skitterende toespraak. Ek dink hy het baie waardevolle voorstelle gemaak, veral in vergelyking met di&#x00E9; wat die agb. lid vir Seepunt gemaak het. &#x2019;n Mens het darem nou iets om op te werk.</p>

<p>Ek wil die departement graag bedank vir die drukwerk wat ons ontvang het, naamlik die jaarverslae en die omvattende oorsig wat ons ontvang het. Ek wil ook aan hulle baie dankie s&#x00EA; vir die interessante toer wat hulle vroe&#x00EB;r gedurende hierdie sitting vir ons gere&#x00EB;l het om sekere Kleurlingwoonbuurte te gaan besoek. As ek nou iets aan die hand kan doen vir die tyd wanneer ek nie meer hier sal wees nie, wonder ek of die departement nie miskien volgende jaar &#x2019;n toer na die Blanke behuisingskemas in die Skiereiland en omgewing moet onderneem nie.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil ook vanmiddag baie dankie s&#x00EA; aan die amptenare van hierdie departement, en ook spesifiek verwys na die amptenare van die streekkan-toor in Kaapstad, met wie ek dikwels in die verlede uit koukusverband en ook as gevolg van die behoeftes van my kiesafdeling moes skakel. Ek het dikwels met hulle in aanraking gekom, en hulle was altyd gaaf en baie vriendelik en behulpsaam. Dit is dus vir my &#x2019;n behoefte van die hart om hulle hartlik te bedank. Ek het hulle soms verwyt daarvoor dat hulle nie die Regering se beleid uitvoer nie, waarop hulle van tyd tot tyd aan my ges&#x00EA; het dat hulle ook nie al die wette het wat hulle nodig het om die beleid uit te voer nie. Daarom meen ek dat ons hierdie mense in &#x2019;n posisie moet plaas om die beleid van die Regering uit te voer, in ooreenstemming met die mandaat wat die Regering van die kiesers ontvang het.</p>

<p>Meneer, hierdie departement doen baie goeie werk. Hy het &#x2019;n rekord van diens en prestasie. As ons kyk na die mate waarin plakkery opgelos is oor, s&#x00EA;, die laaste vyf jaar, as ons kyk na die hervestiging van die Kruispadmense, as ons kyk na die stadskern wat in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain deur die departement self ontwikkel is, omdat niemand anders kans gesien het om dit te ontwikkel nie, dan spreek dit van geweldige sukses. So is daar ook baie ander suksesverhale op die pad van hierdie departement. Die goeie word dikwels verdwerg deur tekorte aan fondse, deur groeiende agterstand en deur emosionele gevalle, maar dit is darem ook waar dat duisende mense huiseienaars geword het as gevolg van die hulp en die werk van hierdie departement, en duisende andere het &#x2019;n dak oor hulle hoof gekry as gevolg van hierdie departement se bemoeiing. Dan, Meneer, praat ek nie eens van die versorging van oues van dae nie. Daarom mag ons nie hierdie goeie rekord vergeet wanneer ons wenke gee, vrae vra en selfs kritiseer nie.</p>

<p>Van vrae gepraat, wil ek ook graag &#x2019;n paar vrae aan die agb. Minister stel. Hy het vroe&#x00EB;r vanjaar verklaar dat &#x2019;n uitsoekwoon-buurt vir Kleurlinge in die Skiereiland ondersoek word. Ek wonder of hy nie vir ons die sluier wil lig oor wat sy bevindings in hierdie verband is nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Beaufort-Wes sou baie graag vanmiddag hier wou wees, om ook te praat oor sy dorp, Laingsburg, in die rampgebied. Hy kan ongelukkig nie hier wees nie. Ons weet dat hierdie departement van die begin af betrokke was met die voorsiening van tydelike huisvesting daar by Laingsburg, en ook by die hervestiging van die gemeenskap. Ons sal baie graag wil weet wat alles tot in hierdie stadium deur die departement vermag is, en miskien ook hoe ver die beplanning gevoer is ten opsigte van die <span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0381"/>nuwe dorp, en wanneer die werksaamhede in daardie verband in volle gang sal wees.</p>

<p>In Oktober verlede jaar het die Minister aangekondig dat &#x2019;n komitee aangestel sou word om laekostebehuising te ondersoek. Onder andere sou hulle kyk na alternatiewe boumetodes, om veral die plakkers te huisves en teen paaiemente wat hulle sou kon bekostig, te hervestig. Ons sal graag wil weet of daardie komitee al verslag gedoen het, en wat dit alles op die pad van hierdie departement vir ons inhou.</p>

<p>In Augustus 1980 het die agb. Minister se voorganger ges&#x00EA; dat hy dit oorweeg om &#x2019;n soort ombudsman in die departement aan te stel, wat spesifiek sou kyk na die probleme in verband met Bruin behuising. Ek kan my nie daaraan herinner dat ek al tot dusver iets in di&#x00E9; verband in die Pers gesien het nie, en ek sal dus graag daaroor wil verneem.</p>

<p>Dan, Meneer, volgens <i>Die Burger</i> van 22 Augustus vanjaar, het die Minister in Port Elizabeth ges&#x00EA; dat die Regering dit oorweeg om minder gegoede jongmense te help om makliker huisvesting te verkry. Hy het ook gepraat van aansporingsmaatre&#x00EB;ls om die private sektor aan te moedig om &#x2019;n groter bydrae tot huurhuisvesting te lewer. Ons sal ook graag in di&#x00E9; verband meer van die agb. Minister wil verneem.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil verwys na &#x2019;n klein onderafdeling in die jaarverslag van die departement, wat handel oor waardasies en die beslegting van geskille oor vergoeding. Hier verwys ek spesifiek na die geskiedenis van die onteiening van die Theewaterskloof-damskema. Ten opsigte van daardie skema sien ek in die jaarverslag dat twee eisers &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r skikkingsbedrag ontvang het as wat die Staat oorspronklik aangebied het. Een eiser het dieselfde bedrag ontvang, en ses eisers het baie minder gekry as die bedrag wat die Staat aanvanklik aangebied het. In die ses gevalle is die skikkingsbedrag ongeveer R207 500 minder as die oorspronklike aanbod. In een enkele geval was die verskil R70 875. Wat vir my opgeval het, is dat hierdie groot verskille in bedrae tussen die oorspronklike aanbod en die skikkingsbedrag net ten opsigte van die onteienings wat by die Theewaterskloofdam gedoen is, gevind word. In vyf ander gevalle het die hof bevind dat die Staat R110 900 te veel aangebied het, en moet die eienaars nou daardie bedrae terugbetaal. Altesaam, die skikking en die hofbevel ingesluit, het die Staat dus R318 000 te veel aan die eisers aangebied. Ek sou graag wou weet op wie se advies dit plaasgevind het. Indien dit amptenare van die departement is, dan sou &#x2019;n mens wou weet watter stappe daar in hierdie verband geneem is. As dit privaatwaardeerders is wat op &#x2019;n agentskapsbasis vir die Staat opgetree het, dan hoop ek dat die Staat hulle dienste nie meer in die vervolg sal gebruik nie. Ek wil s&#x00EA;, Meneer, dat hierdie hele situasie &#x2019;n swak indruk by die publiek gelaat het. Dit is vir my veral opvallend dat dit net ten opsigte van die Theewaterskloofdamskema gebeur het.</p>

<p>Meneer, daar is twee ander sake wat ek graag onder die agb. Minister se aandag wil bring. Ek dink dit is verkeerd dat admini-strasierade permitte uitreik aan Swartes wat in Wit groepsgebiede woon of okkupeer, ten opsigte van enige gebied wat nie vir Swartes opsygesit is nie. Ek verwys nou nie na huisbediendes nie. Die ander bevolkingsgroepe se permitte word deur hierdie departement gehanteer, en terwyl dit hierdie departement is wat die groepskarakter van &#x2019;n bepaalde gebied bepaal, behoort hierdie departement in &#x2019;n posisie te wees om toe te sien dat daardie bepaling uitgevoer word. Tans is dit nie die geval nie, en weet hierdie departement nie van die Swartes wat deur die administra-sierade toegelaat word om hulle in Blanke groepsgebiede te vestig nie. Laat my toe om na &#x2019;n praktiese voorbeeld in my kiesafdeling te verwys. Groot getalle Swartes woon in die Philippi-area in om perde te versorg en op te pas. Dit is &#x2019;n Blanke groepsgebied hierdie, op die drumpel van Nyanga en Guguletu. As ek dink aan die groot getalle Swartes wat daar inwoon, dan wil ek vir u s&#x00EA;, Meneer, dat ek nie vertroue het in die oordeel van die administrasieraad nie, en dink ek het dit tyd geword dat daar eenkanaalkontrole kom, al is wetswysiging daarvoor nodig. In sommige gevalle word hierdie departement en die administrasierade teen mekaar afge-speel.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander saak wat ek graag onder die agb. Minister se aandag wil bring, staan in verband met onwettige okkupasie, waarna ek meen die agb. lid vir Langlaagte ook reeds verwys het. Hierdie indringing is &#x2019;n gruwel wat onlangs ontstaan het, waar mense op moedswillige wyse wederregtelik gaan okkupeer. Die prosedure om hierdie mense te <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0382"/>straf en hulle weer uit te kry nadat hulle oortree het, is na my mening gans te omslagtig en moet dringend hersien word. Tans mag die departement nie op &#x2019;n ander eienaar se eiendom optree nie. Die departement moet &#x2019;n senior aanklaer se hulp inroep. Hy stuur op sy beurt die S.A. Polisie om te gaan vasstel of dit werklik so is dat die mense daar woon of dat die klagtes gegrond is. Die polisie moet getuies wees in &#x2019;n moontlike hof-saak wat kan volg, en die Prokureur-generaal besluit dan of hy gaan vervolg of nie. Hierdie prosedure duur maande, en bowendien is daar verskillende interpretasies tussen die verskillende Prokureurs-generaal, en verskil die prosedures ook. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Ek bedank die agb. Sweep. In die Kaapse Skiereiland is vanjaar 22 sake na Staatsaanklaers verwys. In drie gevalle is geweier om te vervolg en in 19 gevalle is nog niks gehoor nie. Sommige van hierdie sake sloer alreeds so lank as drie jaar. Meneer, daar moet &#x2019;n wet kom waar-volgens &#x2019;n indringer summier uitgegooi kan word, soos hierdie mense wat wonings skaak, en ook diegene wat onwettige plakkers is. Dit het tyd geword dat die Regering uitdruklik toon dat hy bereid is om sy beleid in hierdie verband uit te voer.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Seepunt het, soos ek dink hy al voorheen ook gedoen het, so 14 dae voor die aanvang van hierdie Posbespreking &#x2019;n lang onderhoud gevoer, of &#x2019;n verklaring gemaak, of &#x2019;n artikel geskryf wat in die <i>Argus</i> van 31 Augustus verskyn het.

<p>Hierdie &#x201C;new approach&#x201D; is &#x2019;n geploeter in ou idees van prysgawe van standaarde, die wysiging van boumetodes&#x2014;moontlik &#x2019;n manier waarop hy die Nasionale Behuisingskommissie wou bykom&#x2014;van beheerde plakkery, van &#x201C;site and service&#x201D;-skemas, van die vervanging van die 99-jaarhuurpag ten opsigte van Swartes, met die doel om hulle &#x2019;n absolute vrye reg te gee. Hy het dit teen die Groepsgebiedewet, en instromingsbeheer&#x2014;dit was so &#x2019;n potpourri van ou kos, en niks nuuts nie, ten spyte van die ses kolomme wat hy daarvoor in die <i>Argus</i> gebruik het.</p>

<p>Meneer, ons erken dat daar &#x2019;n agterstand is. Ons erken dat daar &#x2019;n tekort aan fondse is. Daar is ook stygende boukoste, &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; inflasiekoers en &#x2019;n stygende behoefte aan wooneenhede. Daarom moet &#x2019;n mens planne bedink en nuwe oplossings soek en oorweeg. Daar is wel goeie bydraes wat op hierdie gebied gemaak word. Ek wil net verwys na twee. In <i>Die Volkshandel</i> van Augustus 1981 het Danie Greyling geskryf&#x2014;indringend, ontledend en wetenskaplik. Hy maak prinsipi&#x00EB;le voorstelle wat ondersoek moet word. Ek haal aan wat hy ges&#x00EA; het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Boukoste het meer as 25&#x0025; per jaar oor die afgelope vier jaar gestyg, teenoor &#x2019;n inflasiekoers van 10&#x0025; tot 15&#x0025;, wat abnormaal is&#x2026;. Een rede vir hierdie oormatige kostestygings is beslis arbeid.</block>

<p>Dan gaan hy voort en hy vergelyk die lone in die boubedryf met di&#x00E9; in die motorbedryf, en bewys dat die loon vir messelaars buite verhouding hoog is. Dit is een van die redes waarom huisvesting vir die laagbesoldigdes te duur word. Ander sake wat hy in hierdie artikel aanraak, is die onrealisties lae rente-koerse wat woningkoste opstoot en tekorte aan kapitaalfondse veroorsaak; die feit dat werkgewers meer sal moet doen ten opsigte van werknemers; die grootskaalse volwasse opleiding van ongeskooldes; en dat die Staat selfs behoort in te gryp in loonbedinging as dinge daar skeef loop. Dit is konstruktiewe denke, en ek dink dit verdien aandag.</p>

<p>Ek verwys ook na &#x2019;n ander voorstel wat aandag verdien. Dit is ook &#x2019;n saak waarna die agb. lid vir Seepunt so heel terloops verwys het. Ene Benjamin Franklin het in <i>Tegniek</i> van Augustus 1981 &#x2019;n ope brief aan die agb. Minister geskryf &#x201E;om die invloed van die koste van huisvesting op die skep van werkgeleenthede&#x201D; aan te dui. Hy het goed gemotiveerde argumente, voorstelle en gevolgtrekkings, en as die agb. Minister dit nie gesien het nie, hoop ek dat hy nog daarna sal kyk. Dit is inderdaad &#x2019;n plan om die kapitaalerosie van die bougenootskapfondse <span class="col_719-720" refersTo="page_0383"/>te beperk, om woningkoste af te dwing en daarom ook lewenskoste te sny, om huiseienaarskap aan te moedig en speku-lasie te beperk. Hy stel onder andere voor dat die Bougenootskapwet gewysig moet word ten opsigte van twee sake. Ek haal aan wat hy te s&#x00EA; het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Meneer die Minister, ek wil graag voorstel dat u u daarvoor beywer om die bou-genootskapwette so te laat wysig dat: (1) alle woningstransaksies waarin die &#x2018;eienaar&#x2019; se aandeel in die koopsom minder is as 80&#x0025; in die toekoms &#x2018;equity parti-cipation&#x2019;-transaksies teen &#x2019;n vaste langter-mynkoers sal wees; en (2) dat woningtran-saksies waar die &#x2018;eienaar&#x201D;n deposito van meer as 80&#x0025; maak, tradisionele transaksies sal wees, maar gefinansier teen die heersende skommelende prima bankuit-leenkoerse.</block>

<p>Meneer, ek wil nie daarop uitwei nie. Ek wil net byvoeg dat die bougenootskappe dit ook moet oorweeg om hierdie departement se stelsel van &#x2019;n voorkoopsreg binne die eerste vyf jaar oor te neem. Die praktyk bewys dat baie van hierdie leners hulle eiendomme binne die eerste vyf jaar verkoop. As die bougenootskappe voorkoopsreg uitoefen, sal dit ook huispryse afdwing.</p>

<speech by="#widman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened with considerable interest to the hon. member for False Bay, and to the suggestions that he has made here today. We shall miss the hon. member for False Bay in this House. We trust that our loss will be the gain of the Railway Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we are today facing a housing crisis. In fact, the position is chaotic, to say the least. This applies in respect of all population groups. The number one priority of this department that we are discussing here today is the provision of housing, and the Government must take the blame for this. The Government must take the blame for the lack of planning and for the lack of finance. If a patient goes along to the doctor and says: &#x201C;My head is sore&#x201D;, it is no good saying: &#x201C;My arms are fine, my legs are fine, my chest is fine and my heart is fine&#x201D;, if the patient&#x2019;s head is sore. So, whereas we praise the department for the things that they have done, we have to look at the malady which the department is suffering from. The main malady that it is suffering from is a lack of planning and a lack of finance to enable it to carry out its task. In the report of the department mention is made of a requirement of 73 670 units which has to be met. In answer to a question of mine, No. 75 of 4 September, the hon. the Minister said that, as far as Whites, Asians and Coloureds were concerned, there was a backlog of 84 000 units. We know from the report before us that 46 800 units are required for Blacks, which gives us a total requirements of 130 800 units, that we now have to worry about. What has this Government provided this year? The Government has provided precisely R256,7 million, a mere R25 million more than it provided last year. In this same housing report, submitted by the Department of Community Development, we are told that the average cost of one unit is R9 665. If we then take the R256,7 million and ask ourselves how many units we can build at R9 665 per unit, we find that we can build 2 665 units. If we take 2 665 at the average number of units that can be built per year and we divide that into the backlog of 130 800, we find that it will take us 49 years to catch up with this backlog. Therefore, if hon. members tell me that we are not in a chaotic position, I should like to know who is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point put forward valuable suggestions in a very well reasoned speech. However, the hon. member for Bellville, who answered him, said we have heard this all before, we know about all these suggestions. If that is so it is only a greater indictment on the Government. If knowing all these things they still did not do anything about the position and left us in these chaotic conditions, they should take the blame even further.</p>

<p>Hon. members on that side have dismissed site and service. The hon. member for Lang-laagte who was a city councillor, knows very well that in times of chaos, in times of emergency, site and service, although perhaps not the most desirable way out, does provide the basic needs for a community. However, site and service must not be looked upon as a permanent answer. Site and service is a temporary emergency measure to meet an emergency situation. As soon as possible after the emergency has been dealt with, proper housing <span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0384"/>should be provided. Proper housing is far more desirable.</p>

<p>If we are going to at least tackle the probleem, we need a crash programme. We have to look at this as though we really want to do something about it. We have to look at preconstruction methods of building and get away from the conventional building methods. I had the good fortune to go with a city engineer, a chief architect and a housing manager to inspect housing in several countries in Europe, England, Scotland and Ireland, and the United States of America. In Europe alone over 400 different methods of pre-construction is in practice, for instance <i>in situ,</i> costing on site, etc. Schemes of 1 000 units and of 2 000 units at a time were tackled. When those countries were bombed after the 1939-&#x2019;45 war and there was no housing, those countries, England, France and Holland, supplied 500 000 units a year to catch up with their backlog. What is wrong with us? We have a crisis, why do we not face this crisis, why do we not match up with the crisis?</p>

<p>While we want to encourage the private sector I do not want to shift the responsibility of this Government to the private sector. We have our responsibility, but we also want to encourage the private sector. No one can tell me that although rent control does not apply to flats built after June 1966 the private sector did not build, because the evidence led before the Fouche Commission shows that between 1966 and 1976 380 000 units were built by the private sector. Hon. members must not come forward with that argument. Let us be practical, let us see how we can remedy the situation. Utility companies must be encouraged. I think we must work very carefully at this. I say this in anticipation of what the hon. the Deputy Minister of Community Development will perhaps say about utility housing, because if Press reports I have read are correct, he has certain views on how utility companies should be promoted in order to provide housing. Tax concessions were mentioned by the hon. member for Sea Point. In the United States of America bond repayments are tax deductible. Why can they not be here? Improvements to and reconstruction of old houses mean capital expenditure and should be tax deductible. We may even consider to assist landlords and encourage landlords who supply accommodation on a rent basis by taxing them on a lower scale or by allowing them a higher rebate on the income they receive from the letting of their properties. This will encourage them and we will have a two-way deal&#x2014;the landlord will benefit and the tenant will benefit.</p>

<p>We must look at the building societies and the law controlling building societies. The hon. member for False Bay mentioned this in his speech. We must encourage building societies to have all kinds of schemes and we can even amend the law if necessary so that the building societies can have sufficient funds to provide the private sector with adequate housing.</p>

<p>There is also a responsibility on local authorities. As I mentioned during the Second Reading debate on the Appropriation Bill, if it takes five years for a local authority to get a housing scheme off the ground there is something wrong. There is too much red tape. I think we must look at the question of group areas and the land that is available to the local authorities. We must also look at the question of the proper development of a township, the provision of housing, the approval of schemes and the voting of funds. We have to cut down that five-year period to something like two years if we want to tackle our probleem realistically.</p>

<p>As I see it, housing under rent control falls into several categories. There are those built before 21 October 1948. Then there is the second category, viz. those that have been phased out up to June 1966. Then there are those in respect of which there is no control. Those of our people who are above the R650 limit and earn up to R1 000 or R1 200, as the hon. member for Sea Point said, those who are in that grey area, those who are in that category where they are neither fish nor flesh, those who cannot afford to provide housing for themselves but do not qualify for assistance by the State, also need our attention.</p>

<p>Let us deal with the first category of tenant for the moment, those who occupy buildings since prior to 31 June 1966 and who therefore fall under rent control. Whether my figure of 94 200 people falling in this category is correct or whether Mr. Fouch&#x00E9;&#x2019;s figure of 62 000, which was quoted publicly, is correct, I do not want to argue.</p>

<from><span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0385"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">C. W. EGLIN</person>:</from>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On my calculations I make it 94 000 and, as the hon. member for Sea Point says, either way it involves a lot of people. In answer to my question the hon. the Minister replied that during the last six months he has received 630 complaints from tenants, most of them concerning increased rent. We must agree that there is a grave shortage of accommodation for the people in this category. These people have nowhere to go and certainly cannot afford accommodation elsewhere. The position today is that even in this category that I am dealing with the Rent Board is granting increases of 50&#x0025; and 75&#x0025;. I know of a case where a pensioner pays R86 per month which leaves that person R35 per month to live on. I believe we have to look at this situation very carefully because if the Rent Board is granting these large increases and we have no control over the Rent Board, we have to look at other aspects to see whether we cannot control this situation.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek s&#x00EA; baie dankie aan die agb. lid vir Valsbaai. Ek waardeer die geleentheid wat hy my gee.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think we may have to look at some method of&#x2014;reluctant as I am to do so&#x2014;pegging rent increases that landlords may bring about. Let us try and find a formula acceptable to landlords. It may perhaps be based on the rate of inflation, the increase in the cost of living or on some other criteria, but let us try and evolve a formula according to which an increase should not exceed X&#x0025;. Let us get together and try to come to an agreement as to what X should be so that it will be fair to everyone. If there are cases where increases in excess of that X&#x0025; are justified, let such increases be subject to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s control. He should decide whether such an increase above the X&#x0025; is justified. I have faith in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s ability to judge in such cases.</p>

<p>Then there are the tenants who are granted protection in terms of section 19(1)(a) of the Housing Act. These people are submitted to terrible harassment. They are asked to sign affidavits to prove that they fall within the provisions of section 19(1)(a). I have an affidavit drafted by attorneys which was sent to the tenants of a certain building. Not only were they required to disclose their assets, their shares and the shares of their spouse, not only were they required to submit certified copies of everything, but in addition&#x2014;I read paragraph 9 of this affidavit&#x2014;tenants were required to state the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I further attach certified copies of me and my spouse&#x2019;s income tax returns for the aforegoing five years hereto together with the R.P.5 certificate as provided by the various employers of the same period. I confirm the correctness &#x2026;</block>

<p>If this is not harassment of tenants then I do not know what is.</p>

<p>The other category to which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention is the post 1949 pre 1966 category in respect of which rent control has been phased out. These tenants can now obtain protection in terms of section 19(1)(a). However, clever people have now found a loophole. The loophole is very simple. I know of a certain building named Cranston Heights, in which there are 46 tenants. Five of these tenants are protected in terms of section 19(1)(a). The people who have acquired this building have now done a very simple thing. They have formed a share block company and now these five tenants do not have any protection. The only protection they had was in terms of section 39(1) of the Sectional Titles Act. That does not apply to share blocks. The landlord found a beautiful loophole and these poor five people have to get out. The hon. the Minister in terms of section 52(1) of the Rent Control Act decontrolled a building. I know the hon. the Minister may have had very good reason for doing this. The building was Houghton Heights. The hon. the Minister may remember it. There happens to be one tenant in that building who is protected in terms of section 19(1)(a). When <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0386"/>the hon. the Minister decontrolled that building in terms of section 52(1) he did not detach the conditions that were attached to the original proclamations when the rent control was phased out by his predecessor over those three years. That person has no protection whatsoever anymore.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think that needs to be looked at.</p>

<p>I am trying to establish that it is unfortunately essential to have the Rent Control Act and that it is essential for the Minister to have the power to deal with the many complaints that he is faced with all the time so that we can have an end to people being harassed and to people being exploited. Unfortunately, we have to deal with some of those landlords who exploit people. We must proceed along those lines as quickly as possible. Let me just deal quickly with some of the complaints that I have received. I have received complaints that deposits are not returned or, if they are, they are not returned with interest as provided for in the Rent Control Act. The most common complaint next to the question of unwarranted increases in rent is that tenants are not supplied with hot water. We take hot water for granted. A person must bath and a person must have hot water. I have received several complaints in respect of many buildings that landlords are not providing hot water. I can find no law or by-law in terms of which that landlord can be forced to supply the tenants with hot water. We all know of the snowing that lasted from Thursday until today. I can tell the hon. the Minister that there is a building now where no hot water is provided because there is no coal. I think we have to look at these things. In other cases services are reduced. The caretaker is taken away or the daily service that the tenants are entitled to is taken away. In the circumstances I have been forced to form a Tenants&#x2019; Protection Association in Johannesburg. A steering committee has been established in order to lend assistance to the numerous tenants from whom we receive complaints along these lines and along other fines every day. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not consider assisting tenants by establishing some form of official advice bureau so that tenants can get official and proper advice so that they will know where they stand and how to deal with their problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my time is up, but I must raise one more point which concerns the Group Areas Act. The National African Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Naf-coc, applied for premises in the centre of Johannesburg to run this very important &#x2026;</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN GEMEENSKAPS-ONTWIKKELING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, laat my net by wyse van inleiding s&#x00EA; dat ek baie dankbaar is dat die agb. lede woorde van waardering uitgespreek het teenoor amptenare van my departement vir hulle behulpsaamheid en die dienste wat hulle lewer. Ek dink dit is vandag musiek in hulle ore, want gewoonlik kry hulle net stank vir <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0387"/>dank. Die goeie dinge wat ons doen, word dikwels begrawe en die seer vingers wat uitsteek, is gewoonlik di&#x00E9; dinge wat aan die groot klok gehang word. Daarom waardeer ek dit besonder dat agb. lede, en veral van Opposisiekant, vandag hier teenoor my departement en die amptenare woorde van waardering gespreek het. Ek dink die amptenare wat hier is, sal dit met groot genoe&#x00EB; oordra aan hul kollegas wat nie hier is nie. Na rasionalisasie is ons departement nou &#x2019;n geweldig omvangryke departement. Juis om tyd te bespaar&#x2014;en ek is bly dat die agb. lede vir Bellville en Seepunt daarna verwys het&#x2014; het ek hierdie brosjure voor die debat aan agb. lede laat versprei waarin agb. lede &#x2019;n redelike beknopte opsomming kry van die veelvuldige werksaamhede waarby die departement nou betrekke is. Ek het baie groot waardering vir die twee Adjunk-ministers wat saam met my in hierdie departement staan, sy edele Adjunk-minister Wentzel en sy edele Adjunk-minister Cronj&#x00E9;. Adjunk-minister Wentzel sal vandag die vrae oor grondsake en verwante aange-leenthede behartig, terwyl Adjunk-minister Cronj&#x00E9; oor welsynsbehuising, gemeenskaps-fasiliteite en owerheidshulpdienste sal praat en vrae in di&#x00E9; verband sal beantwoord. Ek wil net s&#x00EA; dit is onprakties om te dink dat jy hierdie aantal departemente wat almal saam gerasionaliseer is deur een persoon kan laat behartig. Was dit nie vir die harde werk en die lojaliteit wat ek van my twee adjunkte kry nie, sou ek seer sekerlik die mas nie kon opkom nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook net &#x2019;n woord van afskeid rig aan die agb. lid vir Valsbaai wat &#x2019;n hele aantal jare lank die voorsitter van die Regering-studiegroep in verband met behuising-en gemeenskapsaangeleenthede is. Dit is met gemengde gevoelens dat ons vandag by hierdie geleentheid van hom afskeid neem. Hy was &#x2019;n besonder toegewyde werker en &#x2019;n ewewigtige persoon. Hy was seer sekerlik &#x2019;n aanwins vir hierdie groep in die Parlement en ons is jammer dat ons hom voortaan nie meer in hierdie debatte sal h&#x00EA; nie. Ons sal hom mis. Ons wil hom gelukwens en ook alle voorspoed en sukses met sy nuwe betrekking toewens.</p>

<p>In dieselfde asem wil ek my gelukwense oordra aan die agb. lid vir Bellville wat hom opgevolg het as die Regeringskoukus se voorsitter van die studiegroep gemeenskapsontwikkeling. Die agb. lid vir Bellville het reeds in die verlede getoon dat hy konstruk-tiewe bydraes in hierdie debatte lewer, dat hy &#x2019;n hardwerkende lid is en dat hy beson-dere belangstelling in hierdie werksaamhede het.</p>

<p>I also want to say a special word of welcome to the hon. member for Umbilo who will now lead the NRP&#x2019;s team on housing and community development matters. The hon. member was until quite recently a prominent member of the Natal Exco. With his background and wide experience he will no doubt be able to make an important contribution on the subject of housing and community development.</p>

<p>The chief spokesman of the official Opposition on the department&#x2019;s Vote, the hon. member for Sea Point, has today tried to be constructive in his criticism. I wish to thank him for that. Although I can naturally not always agree with his approach to the solution of our problems in this regard I will gladly look into the positive suggestions made by the hon. member during the course of his speech.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil nie nou in hierdie vroe&#x00EB; stadium op die individuele sake wat agb. lede geopper het, antwoorde gee nie, want dit is heel moontlik dat ander agb. lede in verband met dieselfde aange-leenthede iets kan opper waarop ek sal wil reageer, en ons het nie onbeperkte tyd om te antwoord nie. Daarom wil ek nou net twee aankondigings doen en &#x2019;n bietjie my beleid stel sodat agb. lede presies sal weet waar hulle met my in hierdie verband staan. Dan kan ons later in die namiddag en vanaand in meer detail op die individuele sake antwoord.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Valsbaai het &#x2019;n vraag aan my gestel na aanleiding van &#x2019;n uitgelese Kleurlingwoonbuurt in die Skiereiland. Daaromtrent wil ek graag &#x2019;n verklaring doen. Daar is &#x2019;n lang gevoelde behoefte aan &#x2019;n uitgelese woonbuurt vir Bruinmense in die Kaapse Skiereiland. Die Kleurlinge het by herhaling daarvoor gevra.</p>

<p>Nou wil ek graag aankondig dat ek die Groepsgebiederaad deur die departement versoek het om ondersoek in te stel na die moontlike proklamering van &#x2019;n prestige woongebied vir gekleurdes waar persone in <span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0388"/>die ho&#x00EB;r inkomstegroepe erwe kan bekom en vir huileself huis kan oprig. Die Groeps-gebiederaad het ver gevorder met die ondersoek en het onlangs &#x2019;n verslag aan die departement voorgel&#x00EA; waarin aanbeveel word dat sekere gebiede vir ondersoek geadverteer word. Die advertensies ten opsigte van di&#x00E9; gebiede sal binnekort verskyn en ek wil graag vir die inligting van die Komitee bekendmaak dat hierdie gebiede iewers in die Constantia-area gele&#x00EB; is. Nadat die ondersoek na die proklamering van die gebied voltooi is en &#x2019;n gebied wel as &#x2019;n groepsgebied geproklammeer is, sal dit vir Kleurlinge in die ho&#x00EB;r inkomstegroepe moontlik wees om vir hulle &#x2019;n voorstad uit te l&#x00EA; wat in die beste tradisie van ons beste woonbuurte ontwikkel kan word. Ek wil vertrou dat die geleentheid wat langs hierdie weg aan ons bruinmense in die Kaapse Skiereiland gebied word, ten volle benut sal word.</p>

<p>Dan het die agb. lid vir Bellville gepraat oor die noodsaaklikheid van meer fondse vir die departement. Die agb. lede vir Seepunt en Hillbrow het ook hierna verwys. Daaromtrent het ek die volgende te s&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Tydens die begrotingsdebat en daarna is heelwat ges&#x00EA; oor die bedrag wat in die huidige boekjaar vir behuising bewillig word. Die bedrae wat oor die afgelope 10 jaar vir behuising bewillig is, het vanaf R76 miljoen in 1971/72 progressief jaar na jaar toegeneem tot die R256 miljoen wat vir die huidige jaar bewillig is.</p>

<p>Omdat behuising so &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; prioriteit by die Regering geniet, het ek en die departement oor geruime tyd in oorleg met die Minister van Finansies we&#x00EB; ondersoek om die geld wat vir oprigting van laekostebe-huising beskikbaargestel word tot die maksi-mum verhoog te kry. Ek is bly om vandag te kan aankondig dat die bedrag wat vir laekos-tebehuising vir 1981-&#x2019;82 beskikbaar is nou verhoog is tot R300 miljoen.</p>

<p>Dit is &#x2019;n rekordbedrag en ek is dankbaar vir die hulp wat ek van my kollega, die Minister van Finansies, ontvang het en wat, onder andere, gere&#x00EB;l het dat R30 miljoen se verbande deur bouverenigings van die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds binne die huidige boekjaar oorgeneem sal word. Di&#x00E9; R30 miljoen sal dan natuurlik weer vir behuising beskikbaargestel kan word. Ek wil my waardering teenoor die bouverenigings uitspreek dat hulle hierdie re&#x00EB;ling moontlik gemaak het.</p>

<p>Die verhoogde bewilliging van R44 miljoen sal die departement grootliks help om meer infrastruktuur en erwe daar te stel om persone van alle bevolkingsgroepe in &#x2019;n nog groter mate in staat te stel om in hul eie behuising te voorsien.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Groter aantal gedienste persele kan ook deur die departement aangewend word om behuisingsnutsmaatskappye te help om meer behuising beskikbaar te stel.</p>

<p>Die Regering is diep onder die besef van die ontbering en probleme wat, onder andere, voortspruit uit ho&#x00EB; boukoste en rente-koerse waarmee jong getroude persone tans te kampe het, en wat dit vir hulle uiters moeilik maak om &#x2019;n eie woning te bekom.</p>

<p>Op versoek van my en die departement, en op aanbeveling van die Adviserende Komitee vir Behuisingsaangeleenthede, word sekere voorstelle vir tegemoetkoming van persone wat minder as R1 000 per maand verdien nou diepgaande ondersoek deur &#x2019;n komitee van die Minister van Finansies.</p>

<p>Verdere stappe ter verligting op die behuisingsterrein en middele om bouverenigings en die private sektor in staat te stel om meer op die behuisingsterrein te vermag, word ook van tyd tot tyd deur die Minister van Finansies oorweeg, wat te gelegener tyd daaroor &#x2019;n aankondiging sal doen.</p>

<p>Hierdie daadwerklike stappe in &#x2019;n moeilike klimaat waar groot en toenemende eise aan die Skatkis gestel word, bewys die Regering se erns om soveel as wat maar enigsins moontlik is, te doen om te verseker dat alle lae van ons bevolking behoorlik gehuisves word.</p>

<p>Ek wil daarby aansluit deur te s&#x00EA; ek het voorheen hier in die Parlement ges&#x00EA; dat nie hierdie Regering nie en ook geen ander regering in Suid-Afrika ooit in staat sal wees om uit Staatsfondse in die behuisingsbe-hoeftes van almal in hierdie land te voorsien nie. Dit is ook nie in die vryemarkopset soos wat ons dit hier in Suid-Afrika ken in die eerste plek die verantwoordelikheid van die Regering om dit te doen nie. Dit is in die eerste plek die verantwoordelikheid van die individu om vir homself te sorg vir &#x2019;n dak oor sy hoof. Daarna kom sy werkgewer, daarna die plaaslike owerheid en daarna die private sektor aan die beurt. Eers dan in die <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0389"/>laaste plek het die Regering &#x2019;n verantwoor-delikheid ten opsigte van sekere groepe mense wat behuis moet word.</p>

<p>Daar is te veel mense in hierdie land wat in hierdie verband nie hulle prioriteite reg het nie, wat eenvoudig net na die Regering kyk en verwag dat alles net van die Regering moet kom terwyl hulle geen vinger verroer om vir hulleself behuising te voorsien nie. Ek wil vandag hier baie kategories s&#x00EA; daar-die tyd is nou vir goed verby. Suid-Afrika beskik oor beperkte kapitaalvermo&#x00EB; en ons land het talie dwingende prioriteite minstens net so belangrik as behuising. Ons het in Suid-Afrika tienduisende Blankes wat van-we&#x00EB; hulle inkomste daarop geregtig is om hulle op die Staat te beroep ten opsigte van behuising, maar hulle doen dit nie. Ons vind dat slegs 14&#x0025; van die Wit mense in hierdie land&#x2014;en daar is van hulle met baie beskeie inkomste&#x2014;behuisingshulp van die kant van die Staat ontvang en dat 86&#x0025; van hulle vir hulleself voorsiening maak. Hierteenoor is 92&#x0025; van die Swart mense, 81&#x0025; van die Bruinmense en 60&#x0025; van die Asi&#x00EB;rs tot dusver deur middel van Staatsfondse behuis. Ek s&#x00EA; vandag hier dat daardie tyd nou verby is. Ander bevolkingsgroepe sal eenvoudig net soos die Blankes &#x2019;n opoffering moet maak, hulle prioriteite regkry en vir hulleself iets in hierdie verband doen.</p>

<p>Die Regering het wel &#x2019;n aanspreeklikheid ten opsigte van behuising teenoor diegene wat nie vir hulleself kan sorg nie. In di&#x00E9; verband, afgesien van wat nou hier deur een en ander in oordrywende mate ges&#x00EA; is, het die Nasionale Regering in die tydperk wat hy hierdie land regeer meer as sy deel gedoen ten opsigte van laekostebehuising, welsyns-behuising, veral vir Blankes, slumopruiming en hervestiging van plakkers en stadsver-nuwing. Die Nasionale Regering het in hierdie verband &#x2019;n voortreflike rekord, &#x2019;n rekord beter as di&#x00E9; van enige ander regering wat Suid-Afrika nog gehad het.</p>

<p>Wat die voorsiening van behuising betref, is daar in die afgelope vyf jaar tot 31 Maart 1981 nie minder nie as 160 594 wooneenhede deur die owerheidsektor geskep. In terme van fondse is gedurende hierdie tydperk die volgende bedrae bel&#x00EA;: Deur die owerheidsektor R1 542 miljoen of 25,2&#x0025; van die totale investering in behuising in Suid-Afrika; deur Staatskorporasies R456 miljoen of 7,7&#x0025; van die totale investering in behuis ing in di&#x00E9; tydperk; en deur die private sektor R3 946 miljoen of 67,1&#x0025; van die totale investering in behuising in di&#x00E9; tydperk. Die owerheidsektor saam met die Staatskorporasies het dus oor vyf jaar nagenoeg R2 biljoen in behuising bel&#x00EA;, wat vir Suid-Afrika met sy beperkte finansi&#x00EB;le vermo&#x00EB; &#x2019;n geweldige besteding is.</p>

<p>The figures I have just mentioned underline a few aspects. Firstly, the general assumption that the State attempts to build all the dwellings required in the Republic is a misconception caused by ignorance. The State&#x2019;s contribution in the form of loans granted by the National Housing Commission, chiefly for the construction of low-cost dwellings, is approximately 25&#x0025;, while the private sector made a contribution of 67&#x0025;, spent mainly on the provision of more expensive dwellings for Whites (86&#x0025;) and Indians (40&#x0025;).</p>

<p>A further factor to be considered is the private sector&#x2019;s reluctance to invest in low cost housing for Coloureds and Blacks, primarily, I believe, because it does not find it profitable enough to do so and not, as is stated so often, as a result of obstacles preventing it from making a greater contribution in this field. In so far as Coloureds and Indians are concerned, I wish to make it quite clear that there is absolutely no impediment preventing the private sector, building societies, financial institutions, employers or <i>bona fide</i> developers from providing housing for these communities in their own areas, from owning such immovable property and from letting or selling it to members of the qualified group. Those impediments which existed were gradually removed over the years and after my appointment as Minister I made sure that the remaining obstacles were removed.</p>

<p>The housing shortage is calculated to be roughly as follows: For Whites, 20 000 units; for Coloureds, approximately 45 000 units; for Indians, 20 000 units&#x2014;a total of 85 000 units. However, the number of dwelling projects to be erected with State funds, and presently in the pipeline, are: For Whites, 8 353; for Coloureds, 44 896; for Indians, 18 815&#x2014;a total of 72 064 units as against a shortage of 85 000 units. For Blacks the picture looks different. The backlog is approximately <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0390"/>160 000 units and there are 31 156 units in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit het vandag &#x2019;n gemeenplaas geword vir mense om te s&#x00EA; dat die Staat nie al die fondse kan verskaf om huise te bou nie. Dit is vandag ook weer in hierdie debat beklemtoon. My moeilikheid is egter dat daar so baie rondom hierdie gemeenplaas gepraat word, menings gelug word, kritiek uitgespreek word, oplossings aangebied word deur sogenaamde eksperte en kwasi-deskundiges en na al die praat word daar bit-ter-bitter min ten opsigte van behuising gedoen van die kant van die privaatsektor. Die tyd het aangebreek dat ons nou minder sal praat en dat ons meer in hierdie verband sal doen. Die privaatsektor sal nie daarmee wegkom deur net te praat en te kritiseer en niks te doen nie. Hulle moet nou na vore kom. Daardie agb. lede wat by hulle aan-klank vind, moet my help om hulle betrokke te kry. Ons sal in die toekoms die praters en adviseurs moet toets aan die huise wat hulle oprig en verskaf. Dit is die enigste maatstaf om die kaf van die koring te skei. Die departement met sy dekades van praktiese ondervinding in di&#x00E9; veld was oor die jare nie onvatbaar vir nuwe idees en praktiese benaderings nie. Daarvan getuig ons rekord. Ons het die prestasie gelewer. Ons het die huise gelewer.</p>

<p>We delivered the goods. Dit staan mos soos &#x2019;n paal bo water. Ons is hoegenaamd nie stagnant, ongenaakbaar of bevooroordeeld teenoor enigiets op die behuisings-terrein nie. Ons is nie toe nie. Dit is mos ons &#x201E;job&#x201D; om huise te bou, om huise te verskaf. Waarom sal ons ons met vooropgestelde idees teenoor sekere dinge bevind? Die departement het oor die jare ondervinding opgedoen en proefnemings gemaak met kemhuise, met beheerde plakkery, met erf-en-diens-projekte en selfbou-skemas, en nou maak agb. lede asof dit splinternuwe goed is. Dit is goed wat ons al vergeet het. Dit is goed wat ons al die jare uitgetoets het. Ons het &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van boumetodes, van boumateriaal&#x2014;konvensioneel en onkonven-sioneel&#x2014;oor die jare dwarsdeur die land beproef. Nou moet die agb. lede nie vir my besluit wat ek moet dink nadat ons al di&#x00E9; ondervinding opgedoen het nie. Hier word ges&#x00EA; ons is dit nie eens met die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling nie. Ek en di&#x00E9; departement aanvaar dat wat Swart behuising betref daar tussen binne en buite die nasionale state &#x2019;n verband moet wees en dat dit derhalwe nie met ander behuising oor een kam geskeer kan word nie. Daar is hieroor omtrent geen verskil tussen ons en die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling nie. Om di&#x00E9; rede is die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling besig om die agterstand van Swart behuising, waarvan ek nou net gepraat het, in sekere dele van die land&#x2014;en ek beklemtoon, sekere dele van die land&#x2014;op &#x2019;n ander manier en op ander wyses aan te pak. Ons het daarmee vrede, ons is in di&#x00E9; dinge geken. Agb. lede moet nie dink dit is moont-lik vir daardie departement om in hierdie verband op sy eie aan te gaan nie, want ons verskaf die behuisingsfondse. Hierdie dinge is dus met ons uitgeklaar. U moet dus nie dink dat daardie departement op sy eentjie aangaan met ander metodes en ander maat-stawwe nie. Dit geskied met ons wete.</p>

<p>Wanneer dit kom by behuising vir Blankes, Kleurlinge en Indi&#x00EB;rs in die groot stedelike komplekse, het die ondervinding geleer dat sekere dinge nie sonder ernstige nagevolge en geldelike verlies gedoen kan word nie; daarom s&#x00EA; ek vandag vir agb. lede baie duidelik dat &#x2019;n agterstand in die behuising vir Blankes in die stede nie opgelos kan word met plakkery en erf-en-diens-projekte nie. Dit lyk vir my die agb. lid vir Hillbrow dink dat ons vir Blankes hul probleem ten opsigte van behuising met plakkery en erf-en-diens-skemas kan oplos. Dink hy so?</p>

Ek het vir die agb. lid ges&#x00EA; dat ons nie met toe o&#x00EB; deur hierdie land loop nie. Die departement laat deurlopend deur die Bounavorsingsinstituut op die departement se koste ondersoek instel na boustandaarde. Ons gaan van tyd tot tyd, oor die hele w&#x00EA;reld, kyk wat in ander plekke gebeur. Verlede jaar was daar van ons mense in Hongkong om na di&#x00E9; probleme te gaan kyk. Wat s&#x00EA; &#x2019;n sekere dr. Prior, direkteur van behuisingsbeplanning in Hongkong? Hy s&#x00EA; Hongkong het bykans 20 000 kernhuise vir huisloses gebou. Hulle ondervinding is egter dat weinig van die bewoners hulle kernhuise verbeter. Verval en slum-vorming is aan die orde van die dag.</p>

<p>Ja, maar die agb. lede verwys ons mos gedurig na Afrika. Daardie agb. lid wil mos h&#x00EA; ons moet ons behuisings-probleem soos die Afrika-lande benader. Hulle het dit mos al dikwels ges&#x00EA;. Hulle het ges&#x00EA; ons moet dit oplos soos die Suid-Amerikaanse lande. Nou wil hy nie h&#x00EA; ons moet dit oplos soos Hongkong nie. Nou hoe moet ons dit dan oplos? Ons sal dit oplos, maar daar moet net nie ges&#x00EA; word dat ons departement met oogklappe loop nie. Ek wil nie lank oor hierdie aangeleentheid praat nie. Laat ek nou eens en vir altyd die departement se houding ten opsigte van behuising vir Blankes, Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs stel: dit verskil van die benadering, van die beklemtoning, wat ons ten opsigte van Swart mense in sekere dele van die land en in die nasionale state het. Maar wat hierdie drie volksgroepe betref, wil ek vir u s&#x00EA; wat die Eerste Minister, wat &#x2019;n minister van hierdie departement was, so onlangs soos September 1979 ges&#x00EA; het, wat sy houding is, ten opsigte van sogenaamde beheerde plakkery. Hy het ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Despite the fact that housing must be financed as economically as possible out of State funds, the State is fully aware of the role played by housing in its aim to raise living standards. Consequently it is not prepared to condone shack or squatting conditions. A few scraps of tin, of corrugated iron, nailed to a timber framework, may be regarded by some as shelter, but by no stretch of the imagination could it ever be regarded as housing in the true sense of the word. It is for this very reason, as well as for long-term economic considerations, that the Government does not accept the principle of what is so easily called &#x201C;controlled squatting&#x201D;.</block>

<p>Sedert September 1979 toe sy edele die Eerste Minister so kategories die beleid van die Regering oor &#x201E;controlled squatting&#x201D; ten opsigte van hierdie groepe waarvan ek nou gepraat het, gestel het, het niks in hierdie land verander nie. Ons was in 1979 so pas uit &#x2019;n diep resessie uit; ons was finansieel in &#x2019;n baie slegter posisie as vandag. Die behuisingsposisie in 1979 was baie slegter as wat dit vandag is. Wat het intussen gebeur om ons van mening te laat verander? Ek sal nie die klok 30 jaar terugdraai na die stadium waaraan die agb. lid vir Umbilo ons netnou herinner het nie, toe daar deur die oorlogsjare niks gedoen is, om praktiese redes, ten opsigte van behuising nie. Daarná is voorkeur aan Blanke behuising gegee, soos hy dit hier uitgespel het. Toe het die Bruinmense en ander mense in die slums sit en krepeer. Ek sal nie toelaat dat Suid-Afrika weer in die situasie verval waaruit ons hom &#x2019;n aantal jare gelede opgehef het nie.</p>

<p>Nou wil ek kom by die aanwending van die kapitaalvermo&#x00EB; wat ons het; die Staat se vermo&#x00EB; in hierdie verband. Die departement besef dat ons nie naastenby die geld het om in die geweldige aanvraag vir behuising te voorsien nie. Agb. lede noem hier ander lande van die w&#x00EA;reld. Dit is korrek. Maar u moet nie Holland en Engeland vir ons noem nie, hulle het nie so &#x2019;n groot aantal mense in die lae-inkomstegroep soos wat ons in Suid-Afrika het nie. Wat doen ons nou gedurig om te kyk hoe ons die geld wat die departement kry, kan rek om meer behuising te verskaf? In die eerste instansie kyk ons deurlopend, al die jare al, na standaarde. Die Bounavorsingsinstituut is besig om te kyk na standaarde en materiaal waarop ons kan spaar. Hoewel ons twee jaar gelede nog huise in hierdie land gebou het, laekostebe-huisingseenhede, vir R1 900, het ek, toe ek Minister geword het, gesien ons loop ons vas. Ek stem met agb. lede saam, ons sal ons standaarde moet afbring, maar ons moet by die Witmense begin. Ons kan nie verwag om <span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0392"/>geweldige kastele te bou in ons stadsen-trums, soos wat munisipaliteite in baie dorpe in die land doen nie&#x2014;waar jy op marmer-vloere loop as jy by die stadsentrum inloop, en hier langsaan sit die Indi&#x00EB;rs en Kleurlinge en krepeer, hulle het nie &#x2019;n plekkie om bymekaar te kom nie. Dit geld ook vir behuising. Wie is besig om die boukoste in di&#x00E9; land op te jaag? Nie die departement nie.</p>

<p>Die koste is deur die privaatsektor opgejaag, deur die private man; veral verlede jaar toe lenings by bougenoot-skappe onbeperk was, toe dit eenvoudig deur die dak gegaan het met hierdie dinge. Ander mense wil ook &#x2019;n menswaardige bestel beleef&#x2014;die huis is &#x2019;n persoonlike trots in hierdie land&#x2014;hoekom moet hulle gedurig met die vinger kan wys: Ek sit hier, en kyk hoe lewe die Witmense.</p>

<p>Ek het ges&#x00EA; dat ek besef het dat ons probleme tegemoetgaan, en ek het toe die Louw-komitee aangestel, waarna die agb. lid vir Valsbaai my gevra het, om ondersoek in te stel na die moontlikheid om nie-konvensionele metodes te gebruik om mas-sabehuising te voorsien; om die aanvullende rol wat altematiewe voorsieningswyses kan speel, te ondersoek. Op daardie komitee is verteenwoordigers van die openbare en die private sektor; staatsamptenare, plaaslike besture, die Verenigde Munisipale Bestuur van Suid-Afrika, die Federasie van Bouny-werhede, die Stedelike Stigting en die Bounavorsingsinstituut. Wat kry ons nou? Terwyl ek die komitee aangestel het, loop enige Jan Rap en sy maat die land vol en vertel vir ons hoe ons hierdie probleem moet oplos. Ek het vir die mense gevra hoekom hulle nie voor di&#x00E9; komitee gaan getuig nie. Dan kan ons mos iets vind. Ek sal my laat lei deur die bevindings en voorstelle van hierdie komitee. Ek dink ons het iets in hierdie verband gedoen instede van net te praat. Ons het werklik die probleem lank vooruit gesien, toe daar baie geld was, toe die geld in hierdie land by die bougenootskappe se ore uitgeloop het. Toe daar nie &#x2019;n tekort aan Blanke behuising was nie, het ons gesien, hierdie ding kom, en toe het ek die komitee aangestel. Ek was nog nie eens behoorlik in my pos as Minister gevestig nie. Wat doen ons verder?</p>

<p>Ek laat opnuut en dringend kyk na gevestigde gemeenskappe wat onder die Wet op Groepsgebiede &#x2019;n ander groepskarakter gekry het en waar ons na al die jare nog nie in staat was om die mense te hervestig nie. Waar hierdie gemeenskappe aan die vereistes van afsonderlikheid voldoen, bestendig ek hulle nou. Dit bring mee dat ons &#x2019;n groot las van onsself afneem, deurdat ons nie meer nodig het om groot getalle mense te verskuif en te hervestig nie, en derhalwe ook nie nodig het om altematiewe behuising vir hulle te verskaf nie. Ek het nie gesit en wag vir die agb. lid vir Seepunt om vir my te s&#x00EA; ek moet dit doen nie. Ek doen dit al lank al. Toe ek verlede jaar as Adjunk-minister van Kleurlingbetrekkinge hier in die Kaap afskeid geneem het, het ek ges&#x00EA; ek gaan dit doen. &#x2019;n Voorbeeld hiervan is Maitland Garden Village.</p>

<p>In die derde plek stel ons baie meer erwe beskikbaar in die groter dorpe en stedelike gebiede; vir Blankes, maar ook vir Nie-blankes. In die toekoms sal ons net vir Kleurlinge, Swartes en Indi&#x00EB;rs bou as hulle hulself absoluut nie kan help nie. Ons sal vir hulle erwe beskikbaar stel. Ons sal by die besteding van ons geld in groot mate die klem laat val op die skepping van infrastruk-tuur, en vir hierdie mense &#x2019;n geleentheid gee om vir hulself &#x2019;n huis daar te stel. Dit was nog altyd ons beleid dat die man vir homself moet bou; dit maak nie vir my saak waarmee hy bou nie. Hy moet net aan sekere minimum standaarde voldoen. Ons het in die afgelope tyd honderde erwe beskikbaar gestel. Ons sal in die toekoms meer klem hierop laat val.</p>

<p>In die vierde plek probeer ons met alle mag om in privaatgesprekke, met onder-houde, die privaatsektor aan die gang kry om te help, veral met laekostebehuising. Ons het byvoorbeeld hier in die Kaap 700 erwe beskikbaar gestel aan die Cape Chamber of Commerce, om vir hulle mense behuising te verskaf. Daar is in die jongste tyd &#x2019;n groter belangstelling aan die kant van die privaatsektor. Ek wil dit graag aanmoedig. Ek wil graag &#x2019;n beroep op Kleurling-en Indi&#x00EB;rontwikkelaars doen om na vore te kom en vir hulle mense behuising te skep, maar ek wil ook op bouverenigings, assuran-siemaatskappye en finansieringsmaatskappye <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0393"/>&#x2019;n beroep doen dat hulle van hulle kant af inkom in die behuisingsmark vir die Nie-blankes. Ek sal sorg dat daar nie &#x2019;n strooi in hulle weg gel&#x00EA; word in die Nieblanke gebiede waar hulle vir di&#x00E9; mense wil voorsien nie. Daar is net twee voorwaardes, hulle moet die huis verkoop of verhuur aan die bevoegde groep. Verder kan hulle besit, hulle kan &#x201E;hire and fire&#x201D; soos hulle wil. Ek sal sorg dat daar nie struikelblok in hul pad is nie. Hulle moet dus nie verder hieragter skuil nie, hulle sal daar nie mee wegkom nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur te s&#x00EA; dat ek dink die Staat het oor die jare sy goeie wil in hierdie verband getoon. Ons het ons uiterste gedoen. Ons het &#x2019;n onvergelyklike rekord wat dit betref. Ons kan geblameer word dat ons sov&#x00E9;&#x00E9;l uit die Staatskas bestee het, soos baie mense wel doen. Die feit is dit, die privaatsektor het in die verlede nie sy kant gebring nie. Dit is nou tyd vir hulle om dit te doen. Ons sal probeer met mooipraat, ons sal probeer met insentiewe, ons sal probeer om hulle by behuising betrokke te kry&#x2014; maar die een of ander tyd sal hulle moet na vore kom&#x2014;veral die werkgewer. Ons en die privaatsektor bestee te min aan behuising in hierdie land. Ons kan net nie daarvan wegkom nie. As ons ons besteding aan behuising as &#x2019;n persentasie van die bruto binnelandse vaste investering uitdruk, is dit vir die jare 1977-&#x2019;79 in Suid-Afrika 10,8&#x0025;. Noorwe&#x00EB;, met sy homogene Blanke bevolking, 15,2&#x0025;. Portugal, 18,2&#x0025;; die Verenigde Koninkryk, 19&#x0025;. Australi&#x00EB;, 21,3&#x0025;. Nieu-Seeland, 25,6&#x0025;. Spanje, 26,5&#x0025;. Die VSA, 26,6&#x0025;&#x2014; en ook Kanada. Die Nederlande, 27,2&#x0025; en Wes-Duitsland 28&#x0025;. In aanmerking geneem dat Suid-Afrika nog &#x2019;n snel ontwikkelende nywerheidsland is en geweldig baie moet bestee aan die infrastruktuur vir nywerhede, is dit nogtans duidelik dat die Republiek se investering in behuising in verhouding tot sy bruto investering in kapitaalgoedere aansien-lik laer is as in die genoemde lande. Die Staat sal sy deel doen, en ek het vandag weer hier vir u gewys dat dit &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; prioriteit van die Staat is, maar die privaatsektor sal aan sy verpligtinge in hierdie verband nie kan ontkom nie. Ek laat dit eers daar.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil my graag aansluit by die woorde wat die agb. lid vir Seepunt tot die Minister gerig het en hom verwelkom by die hantering van sy portefeulje hierdie eerste keer. Ek wil ook die gevoel uitspreek dat di&#x00E9; Minister met die sake wat onder sy beheer val, met &#x2019;n baie groter mate van simpatie en wysheid handel as wat ons onder sy voorganger gewoond geraak het.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, maar dit is so. Ek het dit al vantevore ges&#x00EA;. Ek het dit vir die agb. Minister al ges&#x00EA; voordat hy in hierdie posisie aangestel is, en hy weet ek is reg.</p>

<p>Die vergroting van die begrotingsbedrag wat die agb. Minister aangekondig het, die begrotingsbedrag vir die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds, met R44 miljoen is uit die aard van die saak &#x2019;n stap wat ons verwelkom, waaroor ons bly is en wat ook inderdaad die Opposisie se standpunt in hierdie verband korrek bewys het. Ek verwys veral na beroepe wat die agb. lid vir Seepunt in hierdie verband gedoen het, om in die huidige begroting iets drasties te doen. Die Minister het verwys na die persentasies Blankes, Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs en Swart mense wat inderdaad van staatsbehuising gebruik maak wanneer hulle binne daardie kategorie val, wanneer hulle daarvoor kwali-fiseer. Ons is daarvan bewus dat groter persentasies onder die Swart, Kleurling-en In-di&#x00EB;rbevolking inderdaad van hierdie fasiliteite gebruik maak. Ons wil ook die hoop uitspreek dat hierdie wanbalans mettertyd reggestel kan word. Behalwe al die ander faktore wat vir hierdie wanbalans verant-woordelik is, onder andere die verskil in in-komste, en die onderliggende probleme daarvan, is die Regering se ideologiese beheptheid wat ons nie kan ignoreer nie. Die toepassing van die Wet op Groepsge-biede is een van die faktore wat daartoe bygedra het; die ongelyke toepassing van die Wet op Groepsgebiede. U kan maar kyk na die antwoorde op vrae wat ek in die Raad gestel het oor die beskikbaarheid van bou-grond vir Blankes, Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs. Die ongelykheid wat daar geheers het, het tot hierdie situasie bygedra. Ek het oor die afge-lope drie jaar vrae gevra oor bougrond vir hierdie groepe en skokkende antwoorde ontvang.</p>

<p>Hierdie Regering het ook dikwels opgetree <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0394"/>as die vernietiger sowel as die skepper van behuising. Dit is nog &#x2019;n aspek wat tot hierdie soort situasie bygedra het. Die agb. lid vir Seepunt het baie goeie punte in sy toespraak gemaak. Hy het oor die departement gekla en oor die mate waarin die departement nog met ideologiese beheptheid sukkel. As hy ooit bevestiging nodig gehad het vir die standpunt wat hy uitgespreek het, dan is dit vir hom verskaf deur die opmerking van die agb. lid vir Bellville oor die kwessie van instromingsbeheer, en dat hy glo dat instromingsbeheer, en dat hy glo dat instromingsbeheer versterk moet word om die behuisings probleem op te los. Dit is die departement se plig om met die werklikheid saam te lewe. As hierdie departement ook wil saamspeel in die droomw&#x00EA;reld waarin ander departemente hulle begewe, dan sal hy op groot skaal in die moeilikheid beland. Verstedeliking is &#x2019;n feit van die lewe waarmee ons, soos mense in ander lande, moet saamlewe. Nywerheidsdesentralisasie en ander pogings is jare lank al aangewend om die verstedelikingstempo te laat afneem en stop te sit, maar ons weet mos hoe beperk die sukses in daardie opsig was. Om hom nou weer na hierdie ou metodes te wend, is om moeilikheid te soek. Ons hoop van harte die agb. Minister sal nie veel aandag daaraan gee nie, dit is in elk geval nie sy saak nie.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Ek is bevrees nie. Ek het te min tyd. Ek sou dit baie graag wou doen. &#x2019;n Ander aspek wat spruit uit hierdie ideologiese beheptheid is natuurlik die onrealistiese aandrang op standaarde van behuising wat nie altyd gehand-haaf kan word nie. Ek is bly die agb. Minister het daaroor gepraat. Die agb. Minister het inderdaad opgewonde geraak, en ons gekritiseer asof ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad oor iets praat waarvan nou vir die eerste keer melding gemaak word. Ek kan net vir die agb. Minister noem dat in die jaarverslag van sy departement genoem word dat hierdie dinge juis nou ondersoek word. Ons is natuurlik bly daaroor. Al s&#x00EA; die agb. Minister dus dat hierdie dinge jare lank al getoets is en te lig bevind is, wil ek hom darem daarop wys dat volgens die jaarverslag opnuut ondersoek ingestel word na hier die dinge. Hy het dit self bevestig, en ons is bly dat dit inderdaad die geval is. Daar is juis tekens in die jaarverslag dat die Minister en sy departement hulle probeer loswikkel uit hierdie dogmatiese verbondenheid aan onrealistiese ho&#x00EB;standaardbehuising. Sy vrae aan die agb. lid vir Hillbrow, dink ek, was kort in Suid-Afrika regverdig beslis nie &#x2019;n situasie waar ons hoef gebruik te maak van erf-uasie waar ons hoef gebruik te maak van erf-en-diens-skemas of hierdie klas van ding nie. Ons weet mos dat wat betref die ander rasse, en veral die Swartes, ons eenvoudig &#x2019;n krisis-situasie het, waar ons ons na iets nuuts moet wend, en daar is die erf-en-diens-skema &#x2019;n moontlike oplossing. Ek vind dit ook verbasend dat die agb. lid vir Langlaagte&#x2014;ek is jammer hy is nie hier nie&#x2014;ook ges&#x00EA; het dat erf-en-diens-skemas niks beteken nie. Sy argument lui dat die dienste eintlik die helfte van die koste van nuwe behuisingskemas uitmaak. Die agb. lid weet egter dat dit &#x2019;n valse argument is, want die soort dienste wat deel uitmaak van &#x2019;n erf-en-diens-skema kos mos nie &#x2019;n fraksie van die koste van dienste wat gepaard gaan met die verskafflng van kon-vensionele behuising van &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; standaard nie.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. S. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Daar is mos geen twyfel daaroor nie. Die agb. Adjunk-minister weet mos dat daar in baie van die skemas wat deur sy departement geskep is, asook did wat geskep is deur die ander departemente wat ook die belange van anderskleuriges behartig, tot vandag toe dikwels net &#x2019;n paar krane in &#x2019;n hele dorpsgebied is en dat selfs die vullisverwyderingsdien-ste&#x2014;inderdaad al die dienste wat van ower-heidswe&#x00EB; gelewer word&#x2014;van &#x2019;n uiters beperkte aard is. Dit is nie naastenby &#x2019;n ideale situasie nie, maar ons moet mos &#x00EA;rens begin. Agb. lede aan daardie kant weet mos dat die eenvoudige waarheid is dat daar nie vir erf-en-diens-skemas en kembehuising-skemas altematiewe is nie. Agb. lede aan daardie kant het mos nie &#x2019;n alternatief nie. Hulle kan die probleem onder die mat vee, soos gebeur het in die geval van Nyanga, ens., m.a.w. &#x2019;n mens kan die hutte wat daar staan tot niet maak, maar dit is nie asof &#x2019;n <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0395"/>mens daardeur &#x2019;n alternatiewe vorm van behuising skep nie. Daarmee probeer &#x2019;n mens net die probleem uit die oog verwyder, en dit skep vir niemand enige oplossing nie. Daarom s&#x00EA; ek dat alhoewel die erf-en-diens-skemas en kembouskemas nie &#x2019;n alternatief vir konvensionele behuising is nie, skep dit nietemin &#x2019;n oplossing wat byko-mend tot konvensionele behuising toegepas kan word, en ek is bevrees ons sal van daar-die oplossing gebruik moet maak, want vir die soort mense vir wie erf-en-diens-skemas van waarde is, is daar eenvoudig geen ander alternatief nie, in elk geval nie in hierdie stadium nie.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by &#x2019;n aspek waarvan sekere ander agb. lede reeds kortliks melding gemaak het. Ek verwys na die kwessie van woonstelle en huurbeheer. Ek wil graag net &#x2019;n lansie breek vir die goeie woonsteleienaar, die goeie &#x201E;landlord&#x201D; soos hy genoem word. Daar was baie redes om in die afgelope jaar of twee kennis te geneem het van die slegte woonsteleienaar wat elke keer van die wetlike situasie gebruik gemaak het om woonstelbewoners op die gruwelikste moontlike manier uit te buit. Dit is tog tot die krediet van baie woonsteleienaars dat hulle nie van wetlike skuiwergate gebruik gemaak het om mense uit te buit nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil juis praat van daardie mense wat eienaars is van woonstelle wat nog onder huurbeheer is. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

Ek het werklik met aandag probeer luister na wat die agb. lid vir Groenpunt ges&#x00EA; het. Dit het weer eens neergekom op negatiewe kritiek op wat die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling probeer doen. Die agb. lid het onder meer gepraat van in-stromingsbeheer wat op geen manier hoegenaamd doeltreffend toegepas kan word nie. Die vraag is egter of ons dit dan maar net daarby moet laat. Moet daar geen in-stromingsbeheer wees nie? Wat is die beleid van sy party? Is dit die beleid van sy party dat ons maar, soos onder meer in baie ander stede van Afrika, groot krotbuurtes moet laat ontstaan waar mense sonder werk saamtrek? Is dit die alternatief?

<p>Natuurlik, op &#x2019;n menslike wyse sover as wat dit moontlik is. Ek wil my egter nie laat mislei deur te reageer op wat die agb. lid vir Groenpunt te s&#x00EA; gehad het nie, want anders sal my hele toespraak noodwendig ook baie negatief moet wees.</p>

<p>Ek wil net graag enkele gedagtes opper in verband met Kleurlingbehuising. As &#x2019;n mens die verslag van die Erica Theron-kommissie deurlees, kom jy onder die indruk dat daar baie swaar klem gel&#x00EA; word op die feit dat daar in sekere Kleurlingwoonbuurtes nog &#x2019;n gebrek is aan sekere openbare dienste. Dit was egter vir my opvallend dat daar selde of ooit melding gemaak is van die feit dat daar ook spesifieke behoeftes vir handelsfasiliteite bestaan. Daar is natuurlik geen verskil tussen die vermo&#x00EB;ns van &#x2019;n lid van die Kleurlingbevolking en di&#x00E9; van enige ander bevolkingsgroep wanneer dit kom by handel dryf of die uitoefening van enige ander beroep nie. Daar bestaan egter tog verskille as gevolg van hul mindere deelname aan die handel en ander profesionele beroepe in die verlede. Ek dink dat die beleid van die agb. Minister se departement daarmee rekening sal moet hou dat Kleurlingleierskap veral binne gemeenskapsverband saamhang met die geleentheid om binne daardie gemeen-skap meer as net formele onderrig, of opleiding te verkry. Hy moet ook binne daardie gemeenskap &#x2019;n werksterrein h&#x00EA; wat van hom &#x2019;n entrepreneur of ondernemer sal maak wat oorspronklik kan dink. Wat ek eintlik probeer s&#x00EA;, is dat enige woonarea nooit &#x2019;n werk-like gemeenskap sal kan word as hy nie sy <span class="col_745-746" refersTo="page_0396"/>leiers juis kan trek uit &#x2019;n sentrale besigheidskem wat dan in die praktyk die opleidings-terrein aan hierdie mense bied nie.</p>

<p>Dit moet dan mos ook ons ideaal wees&#x2014; en ek dink ek het dit agtergekom uit wat die agb. Minister so pas ges&#x00EA; het&#x2014;dat daardie gemeenskap self-onderhoudend moet word, in die eerste instansie ten minste op die gebied van diensvoorsiening en later selfs op die gebied van behuising. Ons moet natuurlik nooit die geweldige bydrae wat hierdie Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling tot die voorsiening van behuising gemaak het, uit die oog verloor nie. Die agb. Minister het vroe&#x00EB;r melding gemaak van die 160 600 wooneenhede wat in die afgelope vyf jaar verskaf is. Aangesien ons nou van die Kleurlinge praat, kan ek miskien net noem dat 86 000 van daardie wooneenhede aan die Kleurlinggemeenskap toegewys is. Ons mag egter nie daarby vassteek nie. Deur bloot huisvesting te verskaf, maar om nie die sentrale hart, die besigheidskem, ook te verskaf nie, kan daar van &#x2019;n woonarea nie werklik &#x2019;n gemeenskap gemaak word nie. As ons in die Suid-Afrikaanse konteks dit vooropstel dat ons sosio-ekonomiese ontwikkeling en politieke stabiliteit wil h&#x00EA;, moet die uitgangspunt van hierdie Regering&#x2014;en al die agb. lede aan hierdie kant van die Raad &#x2014;wees dat elke bevolkingsgroep &#x2019;n reg op &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe het, en ek beklemtoon die &#x201E;reg op &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe&#x201D;. Dit moet egter &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe van &#x2019;n sekere gehalte wees, wat myns insiens alleen moontlik is as ons &#x2019;n gemeenskap kan skep wat as sentrale punt sy besigheidskern het waaruit sy leiers ook kan kom, en daardie leiers hulle dan aan hul mense diensbaar kan stel.</p>

<p>Hoe belangrik ag hierdie Regering &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe? Ek wil net &#x2019;n paar kort stukkies aanhaal uit die toespraak van die agb. Eerste Minister. Die agb. Eerste Minister vergelyk &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe met ander alternatiewe wat aangebied word, onder meer di&#x00E9; van die amptelike Opposisie, en s&#x00EA; hy die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Teenoor hierdie denkrigting staan die Nasionale Party en die Regering &#x2019;n beleid voor wat rekening hou met die grondbeginsel en die waarheid van veelvolkigheid en die bestaan van minderheidsgroepe met die konsekwensies daaraan verbonde.</block>

<p>Dan spel die agb. Eerste Minister dit breedvoerig uit. Hy s&#x00EA; ook&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is verder die instandhouding van die gesins-en die gemeenskapslewe.</block>

<p>Voorts s&#x00EA; hy weer eens&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is dus ook die instandhouding van die gesins-en gemeenskapslewe.</block>

<p>Dan spel die agb. Eerste Minister uit presies wat hy daarmee bedoel, en dan kom die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wat is nie onderhandelbaar nie? Ek praat namens hierdie kant van die Raad wanneer ek s&#x00EA; dat hierdie dinge wat ons betref nie onderhandelbaar is nie.</block>

<p>Dan kom &#x2019;n baie belangrike deel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As die onderskeie bevolkingsgroepe van Suid-Afrika nie hierdie dinge vir mekaar gun nie, kan daar geen geregtigheid wees wat as riglyn vir ons land kan dien nie.</block>

<p>Die hele begrip van verdeling van mag en &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe kry myns insiens alleen inhoud as ons so &#x2019;n gemeenskapslewe ook aan die Kleurlingbevolkingsgroep gun sodat hulle hul eie vermo&#x00EB;ns en aspirasies daar binne ten volle kan uitleef.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is moontlik as ons kyk na die pragtige voorbeeld van Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain. Ek wil kortliks aanhaal wat reeds in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain gebeur het in verband met die skepping van die besigheidskerns of &#x201E;-harte van gemeenskappe&#x201D; wat ek reeds genoem het. Daar het ons reeds die eerste pragtige suksesstorie, die eerste pragvoorbeeld daarvan, gehad. Daar word geraam&#x2014;en ek verwys agb. lede na die verslag van die Departement van Gemeenskapsbou&#x2014;dat die handels-aktiwiteite in die stadskern van Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain 2 500 addisionele werkgeleenthede vir Kleurlinge sal skep. Voorts word daar ook geraam dat die jaarlikse kleinhandelspoten-siaal van Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain teen 1985 R115 miljoen sal beloop. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil die agb. lid vir Fauresmith hart-lik gelukwens met sy uitstekende en baie interessante toespraak.</p>

<p><span class="col_747-748" refersTo="page_0397"/>Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt het onder meer na verstedeliking verwys. Ek wil hom nie &#x2019;n onreg aandoen nie, maar verstedeliking is &#x2019;n onafwendbare verskynsel waarmee &#x2019;n mens maar vir lief moet neem, want niemand kan iets daaromtrent doen nie.</p>

<p>Onbeheerde verstedeliking skep matelose ellende in baie dele van ons land. Dit is natuurlik ook &#x2019;n ou verskynsel, en die ellende neem natuurlik ook by die dag toe. Daarom kan Suid-Afrika met sy veelvolkige samestelling, en die probleme van sy ver-skeie bevolkingsgroepe, nie sommer s&#x00EA; dat Gods water maar oor Gods akker moet loop en al die gepaardgaande ellende maar sommer moet plaasvind nie, want dan sou daar geen wet, orde, stabiliteit en vooruitgang wees nie. Hierdie departement kan ook nie sommer s&#x00EA; dat plakkery &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sal die agb. lid my asseblief &#x2019;n kans gee? Dit is nie onvermydelik as daar reg beplan word nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] As die agb. lid my net &#x2019;n kans sal gee, sal ek verder verduidelik. Aangesien plakkery normaalweg op onbeheerde verstedeliking volg, spreek dit mos vanself dat &#x2019;n behoorlike regering nie met sy arms gevou sal sit en s&#x00EA; die ellende moet maar voortduur nie. Nee, wanneer &#x2019;n mens van verstedeliking en plakkery praat, moet jy dinge in perspektief sien, want die probleme wat daaruit voortvloei is legio, en hulle is ook groot probleme.</p>

<p>Vandag wil ek interessantheidshalwe kort-liks verwys na die geskiedenis van plakkery in Suid-Afrika. Jan van Riebeeck het reeds in 1655 gekla dat 50 van die destyds inheemse bevolkingsgroep onwettig by die fort gehuggies opgerig het. In 1836 moes die destydse goewemeur strenger maatre&#x00EB;ls tref om onbeheerde plakkery die hoof te bied. In 1879 was daar die beroemde Cape Vagrancy and Squatting Act toe daar maatre&#x00EB;ls getref moes word om hierdie euwel te probeer bekamp. Ten spyte daarvan het hierdie euwel sy kop verder uitgesteek. Dit wil egter nie s&#x00EA; dat indien daar nie maatre&#x00EB;ls getref is, die euwel nie op &#x2019;n gegewe moment groter sou gewees het nie.</p>

<p>Kom ons kyk wat gebeur het gedurende en na die Eerste en Tweede W&#x00EA;reldoorlog. Die verskynsel het sulke afmetings aan geneem dat daar in 1942 geraam is dat daar in die Kaap en omliggende streke nie minder as 82 000 plakkers gewoon het nie. As &#x2019;n mens dit in ag neem en die hele aangeleent-heid in die regte perspektief beskou, moet jy noodwendig geweldige waardering h&#x00EA; vir die werk wat die departement en die Regering in die geheel gedoen het om daardie ongelukkige mense oor die jare heen te vestig en te behuis. Dit is natuurlik &#x2019;n langsame taak. Dit is nie &#x2019;n taak wat tot vandag of m&#x00F4;re beperk kan word nie. Dit is nie &#x2019;n probleem wat onmiddellik deur die huidige geslag opgelos kan word nie. Dit is vanself-sprekend &#x2019;n taak wat so lank sal duur as wat daar mense is, maar ons moet nietemin waardering h&#x00EA; vir die enorme vordering wat hierdie Regering&#x2014;en spesifiek hierdie departement&#x2014;gemaak het om ons mense in die laer inkomstegroepe te huisves. Volgens alle skrywers&#x2014;en ek dink nie ek oordryf as ek dit vandag hier s&#x00EA; nie&#x2014;is daar geen land in die Derde W&#x00EA;reld wie se prestasies naastenby vergelyk kan word met di&#x00E9; van hierdie land en sy Regering nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daar is geen ander land met vergelykbare omstandighede wat selfs naastenby Suid-Afrika se vordering op die gebied van behuising kan ewenaar nie. Daarom is dit so oneindig belangrik dat ons, in &#x2019;n gesprek soos hierdie, sake in perspektief moet sien wanneer dit kom by verstedeliking en die plakkery wat normaalweg daarop volg.</p>

<p>Wanneer &#x2019;n mens oor hierdie sake praat, kom daar egter by jou &#x2019;n vraag op in verband waarmee daar ook baie min perspektief geopenbaar word, en dit is: Wat is die redes vir plakkery? Daar is natuurlik &#x2019;n baie na&#x00EF;ewe oplossing. Ons verskaf net behuising en die plakkery is onmiddellik iets van die verlede. Dit is mos egter &#x2019;n halwe waarheid. Plakkery kan mos nie net met behulp van behuising uit die weg geruim word nie. Plakkers verlaat mos nie hul plek van oorsprong omdat hulle ontevrede is met hul tradi sionele vorm van behuising nie. Nee, hulle het hul plekke van oorsprong verlaat omdat hulle onder die waan verkeer het dat dit in die stede met hulle beter sou gaan omdat-daar vir hulle daar baie meer werkgeleent-hede sou wees. Wat is dan die klaarblyklike oplossing? Die klaarblyklike oplossing l&#x00EA; in wat hierdie Regering al van die vroegste tyd af konsekwent besig was om te doen by wyse van beplanning, desentralisering, <span class="col_749-750" refersTo="page_0398"/>opleiding en die skep van werkgeleenthede. Is dit dan nie ook moontlik dat daar in die tye waarin ons lewe &#x2019;n landbouleier of &#x2019;n nyweraar dalk sal voorstel dat ons minder moet meganiseer en meer van ons beskik-bare hande-arbeid gebruik maak nie? Ek s&#x00EA; dit omdat dit vir ons in Suid-Afrika ontsettend belangrik is om in ons <i>hinterland</i> werkgeleenthede te skep. As daar so &#x2019;n landbouleier of nyweraar na vore sou tree, sou ons dan in hierdie verband soveel meer kon vermag om die onmoontlik vinnige toename in plakkery die hoof te bied.</p>

<p>Ons kan egter ook vra wat die omvang van plakkery hier in Suid-Afrika is. In hierdie verband kan ons na my mening ook hulde bring aan hierdie departement. As &#x2019;n mens die geweldige omvang van die probleem in ag neem waarmee hulle te doen gehad het, en as jy sien hoe die getal plakkers afgeneem het tot minder as 19 000, besef jy hoeveel hierdie departement in werklikheid reeds vermag het.</p>

<p>Dit is natuurlik vanselfsprekend dat ons plakkery beperk is tot die grootste metropole of sentra, bv. Kaapstad, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley, Pietermaritzburg en Pretoria.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander vraag wat &#x2019;n mens jouself kan afvra, is: Waarom kan ons nie plakkery maar ooglopend toelaat nie? Dit is miskien die beleid van ons agb. kollegas oorkant dat ons plakkery maar sonder meer&#x2014;en eintlik onwettig&#x2014;moet toelaat. Die antwoord l&#x00EA; natuurlik voor die hand, en die agb. Minister het dit vandag baie duidelik hier uitgespel. Geen land wat &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; premie op orde en goeie maatskaplike toestande plaas, kan die onhigi&#x00EB;niese saamdromming van &#x2019;n mense-massa, wat normaalweg die broeines van ellende, siektes en talie tragedies is, sonder meer toelaat nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daarom kan hierdie Regering&#x2014;en meer spesifiek hierdie departement&#x2014;dit mos nooit sonder meer toelaat nie. Daarom is dit dan ook verskriklik belangrik dat ons te alle tye poog om nougeset die riglyne na te volg wat ons Regering en hierdie departement neergel&#x00EA; het om hierdie tragedie die hoof te bied. Die riglyne is al verskeie kere hier baie duidelik uitgespel, maar ek wil net graag weer na hulle verwys.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is uiters belangrik dat daar in verband met ons Swart mense instromings-beheer moet wees. Dit kan mos nie anders nie. Niemand in hierdie Raad kan vandag opstaan en s&#x00EA; ons bepleit die afskaffing daarvan nie. Dit moet vanselfsprekend daar wees. Daar moet egter steeds gepoog word om in die <i>hinterland</i> werkgeleenthede vir ons mense te skep. Derdens is dit belangrik dat daar gepoog word om huisvesting te verskaf aan die mense wat daarop geregtig is. Die agb. Minister het dit alles baie duidelik vandag hier uitgespel. Hierdie misverstand of wanopvatting dat dit alleen die Staat se plig is om te alle tye huisvesting aan mense te voorsien, moet uit die weg geruim word. Dit is &#x2019;n heel verkeerde opvatting. Dit kan eenvoudig nie gebeur nie. Dit kan nie in Suid-Afrika gebeur nie en dit kan ook n&#x00EA;rens elders in die w&#x00EA;reld gebeur nie. Dus die belangrikheid van wat somtyds genoem word &#x201E;die driemanskap&#x201D;, die Staat, die privaat-sektor en die individu. Elkeen moet sy kant bring. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek het op &#x2019;n ander geleentheid, gedurende die bespreking van &#x2019;n ander begrotingspos, die kwessie van plakkery behandel. Ek is dus nie van plan om dit vandag verder op te volg nie. Ek wil egter net aan die agb. lid vir Newton Park, wat so pas gaan sit het, s&#x00EA; dat as hy dink dat plakkery geweldig verminder het, hy gerus weer kan gaan kyk. Hy moet &#x2019;n bietjie kom kyk wat daar in die omgewing van Durban aangaan. Die agb. Adjunk-minister sal weet waarvan ek praat. Die feit dat dit in kwaZulu plaasvind, beteken nie dat die verskynsel verdwyn nie. Die verskyn-sel het net van een plek na &#x2019;n ander verskuif. Dit is beslis nie &#x2019;n probleem wat afgeneem het of wat besig is om te verdwyn nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. Minister het ges&#x00EA; dat die tyd verby is dat daar verwag kan word dat die Regering alleen behuising aan mense moet verskaf. Ek stem heelhartig met hom saam dat dit onmoontlik is vir enige regering om alle behuising te verskaf. Die agb. Minister het egter ook gepraat van werkgewers, bou-genootskappe en ander dele van die privaat-sektor wat nie hul deel bydra nie. Hy moet egter nie met sulke vroom praatjies na vore kom nie. Wil hy werklik voorgee dat die Regering geen struikelblokke in hul weg plaas nie? Waar kan &#x2019;n werkgewer wat &#x2019;n huis vir &#x2019;n Swart werknemer in die omgewing van Durban wil bou, in werklikheid so &#x2019;n huis oprig?</p>

<p>Elke keer as ek egter navraag doen namens mense wat hul werknemers graag wil help, word daar ges&#x00EA; daar sal volgende jaar grond beskikbaar wees, of miskien die jaar daarop, ens. Laat ons nou &#x2019;n oomblikkie eerlik wees. Daar is so iets soos &#x2019;n Groepsgebiedewet en daar is talie beperkinge. Daar is ook so iets soos die reg om eiendomsreg te verkry as dit &#x2019;n Blanke maatskappy is wat &#x2019;n lening toestaan vir die oprigting van &#x2019;n huis. Daar is baie probleme, maar dit is nie nou die tyd om op al daardie probleme in te gaan nie.</p>

<p>In die kort tydjie tot my beskikking wil ek graag &#x2019;n saak behandel wat van baie groot belang is vir my kiesafdeling.</p>

<p>This department has two responsibilities. One is to provide housing and the other is to protect the public against exploitation. I agree that a great deal has been done in the provision of housing, but in recent times, I believe, the Government is washing its hands of its responsibility for the protection of the public. I do not want to get involved in the theoretical argument about whether rent control is good or bad. I am not arguing about theory now. Obviously rent control is not the answer, and equally obviously the ideal is to allow supply and demand&#x2014;the operation of normal private-enterprise practices, to be the deciding factor. I am thinking, however, of the reality and not the ideal, not the Utopia the Government always envisages. The Government, it seems, can see Utopia in the most impossible places. I, however, am talking about the reality of the situation, about what is happening. They would also be able to see the reality of the situation if they could put themselves in the shoes of the people with fixed incomes, pensioners or people living on investments. In the discussion of other votes I have offered to take Government members around my constituency. I wonder how many of those hon. members have ever had, day after day, to walk from one estate agent to another or from one letting agent to the next seeking a flat. If those hon. members were to take my offer literally and put themselves in the shoes of those people, they would very soon have worn their shoes out, because it is a question of going from one letting agent to another. The hon. the Minister knows that there are almost no flats available that are within the reach of a pensioner. Let us imagine ourselves as pensioners with R109 per month, or perhaps a couple with R218 per month. [Interjections.] Remember, it is not yet 1 October. I am talking about the position today. On that money those people have to come out. Even if the position improves slightly in October, by that time the rents will have gone up again.</p>

<p>I can give many examples. One of the buildings about which I am still waiting for an answer is a block of flats called Tenbury. In three years the rent for a particular flat went up from R120 to R125, and then finally to R203 on 3 June this year. That is not all. There is another building where the rent went up from R109,72 to R150, and this was also in the month of June. There were, in fact, two increases within six months, on 1 January and in June. So from January to June there was a 50&#x0025; increase. Another building went up from R66 to R79. So I can go on with building after building. Olwyn Court went up by 50&#x0025;. The rentals of the rent-controlled flats in this particular block are higher than that of the uncontrolled flats that are being let on the open market.</p>

<from><span class="col_753-754" refersTo="page_0400"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>When I took the matter up, they said that they determined what they considered to be a reasonable rental. But here we have controlled flats fixed at a higher rental than the ordinary commercial letting rate. If the Rent Board is supposed to fix a reasonable rental, surely the first thing it will take into account is what the landlord is asking for flats in the same building on the open market. Surely that must be a reasonable rental if that is all the landlord is asking. What he wants is to sell those flats.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can raise point after point. I have files of correspondence. The regulations for determining the protected tenant&#x2019;s position is something I wrote about months and months ago. Permits for reconstruction are issued where everybody has to get out of a building because they have to put new electric wiring in. I have just had a Supreme Court case, where with the aid of legal aid we fought a case right through to the Supreme Court. Like TAFTA did in its annual report this year, I want to say in respect of Durban that it is a critical situation for hundreds&#x2014;no&#x2014;thousands of people in South Africa. I believe we cannot simply say: &#x201C;It is a lovely country. The sun is shining. We have built a lot of houses and are now getting rid of rent control.&#x201D; I believe we owe these old people a responsibility.</p>

<p>I come back to my old proposal and I conclude with this: Why in heaven&#x2019;s name does the Government not buy up these old buildings which are being sold quite cheaply to developers who dolly them up and sell them as holiday flats at a fantastic profit? Why does the Government not, with the help of private enterprise, let those flats to the needy? Bring in private letting agents if the Government cannot do it themselves. For the money they spend on building ten houses, they can accommodate 50 tenants in an old block of flats simply by doing it up and making it habitable.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>It is not creating extra accommodation to buy flats like that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>It is, because that accommodation is being lost to the needy. They are being turned into luxury flats. Marlborough Court, which I am dealing with at the moment, is being turned into double luxury flats to sell to holidaymakers who come down two or three times a year from Johannesburg. The rest of the year this building stands empty. Hundreds and hundreds of flats are standing empty, belonging to holidaymakers who use them for a month or two a year. All those old people are being thrown out so that their flats can be converted into luxury flats. This developer is, therefore, reducing the number of flats that are available. [Time expired.]</p>

<speech by="#heyns">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HEYNS</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek dink dat daar &#x2019;n basiese verskil bestaan tussen hierdie kant van die Raad en die amptelike Opposisie met betrekking tot ons benadering van hierdie probleem. Soos ek die agb. Minister verstaan, is die uitkyk van hierdie kant van die Raad dat die behuising-strategie nie net daarop gemik is om onderdak aan mense te verskaf nie, maar ook gemik is op die bevordering van &#x2019;n gebalan-seerde gemeenskapsontwikkeling en die vorming van gemeenskappe wat stabiele eenhede sal wees sodat &#x2019;n stabiele bevolkings-eenheid verkry kan word. Dit is waar die verskil in benadering l&#x00EA; tussen hierdie kant van die Raad en daardie kant van die Raad.</p>

<p>Die agb. Opposisie se uitgangspunt is plakkery en enige ander manier net solank as wat die situasie verwar kan word. Hulle het nie standaarde, &#x2019;n strategie of &#x2019;n substantiewe ontwikkeling van gemeenskapslewe met hulle voorstelle in gedagte nie.</p>

<p>Wat die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt betref, het ek simpatie vir die probleme waarop hy gewys het. Hier is die probleem egter dat &#x2019;n mens nie van die Regering kan verwag om die probleemalleen op te los nie. Ek sal later in my toespraak weer op &#x2019;n paar stellings van die agb. lid reageer. Hy het sekere vrae aan die agb. Minister gestel en ek glo dat die Minister hom self daarop sal antwoord.</p>

<p>Wanneer &#x2019;n mens na die bedrywighede van die departement oor die afgelope paar jaar kyk wat die agb. Minister en sy twee Adjunkte aan die roer van sake gestaan het, voel &#x2019;n mens dankbaar vir wat hulle vermag het. Daar is byvoorbeeld die gemeenskaps-projekte om in bestaande woongebiede geriewe te skep. Dit is iets wat oor die afgelope paar jaar plaasgevind het. &#x2019;n Mens sien dat &#x2019;n bedrag van R65 812 967, en &#x2019;n bedrag van R21&#x00BD; miljoen vir die Nasionale <span class="col_755-756" refersTo="page_0401"/>Behuisingsfonds, goedgekeur is vir die ontwikkeling van gemeenskapsprojekte. Hier-die fondse sal baie bydra tot gemeenskaps-ontwikkeling en die daarstelling van stabiele gemeenskappe. Dit is heeltemal &#x2019;n ander strategie as wat die agb. Opposisie voorstel.</p>

<p>As ons na al hierdie goeie werk en die nuwe benadering van die departement kyk, sit ons egter nog met probleme. Ons het te min behuising en het te kampe met &#x2019;n bevolkingsaanwas wat van die hoogste in die w&#x00EA;reld is. Ten einde hierdie behuisingskrisis die hoof te kan bied, wil ek op die volgende knelpunte wys wat na my mening identi-fiseerbaar is. Eerstens, het ons &#x2019;n tekort aan beskikbare grond. Tweedens het ons &#x2019;n tekort aan beskikbare kontantvloei en kapitaal ten einde behuising te finansier. Derdens, is boukoste ook te hoog. Vierdens, word bestaande behuising nie effektief gebruik nie.</p>

<p>Wat die oneffektiewe benutting van bestaande behuising betref, wil ek verwys na &#x2019;n bestaande ordonnansie in die Kaapprovinsie. Ek sal bly wees as die agb. lid vir Umbilo daarop wil reageer en vir ons wil s&#x00EA; of dit ook die geval in Natal, die Transvaal en die Vrystaat is. Ek verwys na die ordonnansie wat in Kaapland bestaan dat daar op een perseel nie meer as een huisgesin in &#x2019;n gebou mag woon nie. Prakties gebeur dit vandag in duisende gevalle dat daar mense is wat deur die aanbou van &#x2019;n badkamer of &#x2019;n klein kombuisie woongeriewe wil skep vir &#x00F2;f hulle ouers &#x00F2;f &#x2019;n familielid &#x00F2;f iemand anders wat daarin geakkommodeer kan word.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. HEYNS</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, skoonma se hoekie. As hierdie ordonnansie opgehef kan word sodat dit wel kan gebeur, glo ek dat dit baie daartoe kan bydra om verligting in hierdie verband te bewerkstellig.</p>

<p>Ek dink ons almal stem saam dat ons &#x2019;n totale behuisingstrategie in hierdie land van stapel moet laat loop. Die agb. Minister het vandag baie duidelik laat blyk dat dit sy voorneme is. In hulle nuusbrief van 6 Mei 1981 steun die Kamer van Koophandel hierdie siening en verklaar dat daar nie van die Regering verwag kan word om op sy eie in al die behuisingsbehoeftes te voorsien nie. Hulle s&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Private sector funds must be mobilized for low-income housing to augment the State&#x2019;s contribution. Public funds should be used primarily for the purchase of land and the provision of essential services, as well as infrastructure.</block>

<p>So kan &#x2019;n mens ook verwys na wat dr. Webb in die <i>Sunday Times</i> geskryf het.</p>

<p>Ten einde hierdie totale strategie te ontwikkel, glo ek dat die credo moet wees dat daar &#x2019;n huis vir elke gesin van &#x2019;n redelike standaard en binne daardie gesinne se ver-mo&#x00EB;ns verskaf moet word. Ten einde dit te kan doen, glo ek dat ons om die posisie te stabiliseer nie moet dink aan die herinstelling van huurbeheer soos ek dink die agb. lid vir Hillbrow ten dele te kenne gegee het nie, omdat dit nie die oplossing is nie. Ons moet eerder op die aanmoediging van die private bedryfslewe konsentreer, sodat meer ontwikkeling kan plaasvind.</p>

<p>Ek wil dus aanbeveel dat &#x2019;n pakketooreen-koms aangebied word, wat byvoorbeeld belastingverligting wat verband hou met die waardevermindering op geboue kan insluit. Dit is vir my &#x2019;n beter alternatief as byvoorbeeld die subsidi&#x00EB;ring van rentekoerse soos sommige mense te kenne wil gee die agb. Minister van Finansies in die vooruitsig gestel het toe hy &#x2019;n sekere toespraak gelewer het.</p>

<p>Na aanleiding van wat dr. Webb ges&#x00EA; het, het die <i>Sunday Times</i> van 19 Oktober 1980 onder meer soos volg berig&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Housing subsidies are, according to Dr. Webb, &#x201C;an invention of the devil&#x201D;. He believes that they keep residential property prices artificially high and that they should be done away with. Alternatively, he advocates that all housing subsidies should be taxed like other perks despite the unpleasant consequences for home owners.</block>

<p>Ek dink dat ons in plaas van subsidi&#x00EB;ring eerder meer behuisingsprogramme moet aanpak. Ten einde meer geld beskikbaar te stel, moet daar aan die volgende gedink word. Ten einde bougenootskappe in die geleentheid te stel om langtermynfondse teen gestabiliseerde rentekoerse te skep, moet hulle toegelaat word om net soos banke VDS&#x2019;e of verhandelbare sertifikate uit <span class="col_757-758" refersTo="page_0402"/>te reik. Dit sal die skepping van langtermyn-fondse teen gestabiliseerde rentekoerse in die hand werk.</p>

<p>Tweedens, wat bougenootskappe self betref, moet hulle die diensbaarheidmotief in plaas van die winsmotief handhaaf met die verskaffing van fondse om sodoende die individu behulpsaam te wees met die verkry-ging van huise, om behulpsaam te wees met die skepping van maatskappye vir die verkryging van woonstelle in plaas daarvan om self daarin handel te dryf. In hierdie verband wil ek graag verwys na wat byvoor-beeld in Denemarke gedoen word. Daar het hulle 500 ko&#x00F6;peratiewe behuisingsvereni-gings of openbare nutsmaatskappye wat reeds 280 000 huise opgerig het waarin ongeveer een miljoen mense woon. In Engeland bestaan daar &#x2019;n soortgelyke situasie. Nog meer mense en organisasies as in Denemarke is by die stelsel in Engeland betrokke. Ek dink dit is iets wat ons kan oorweeg. Bougenootskappe kan di&#x00E9;gene wat nie verenigings of maatskappye kan skep nie as gevolg van gebrekkige kennis, help om so &#x2019;n stelsel te inisieer.</p>

<p>Vervolgens wil ek &#x2019;n voorstel doen wat ek oortuig is sal bydra tot die verkryging van fondse. Daar moet toegelaat word dat pensioenfondse en versekeringsmaatskappye &#x2019;n deel van hulle fondse wat in openbare maatskappye of Regeringseffekte bel&#x00EA; moet word, in bougenootskappe kan bel&#x00EA; as deel van hul voorgeskrewe bates, om fondse in die lang termyn, weer eens teen gereguleerde en gestabiliseerde rentekoerse, aan bougenootskappe beskikbaar te stel. In hierdie verband wil ek net in die verbygaan die opmerking maak dat wat pensioenfondse betref, hulle as gevolg van die oortollige geld waaroor hulle beskik en nie weet wat om daarmee te maak nie, veroorsaak dat eiendomspryse en kantoorkomplekse se pryse geweldig die hoogte in skiet.</p>

<p>Vir die groter beskikbaarstelling van grond wil ek voorstel dat die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling dit moet oorweeg om alle grond waaroor hy beskik&#x2014;hier dink ek veral aan Blanke behuising&#x2014; onmiddellik beskikbaar moet stel in plaas daarvan om dit oor &#x2019;n termyn van 20 jaar te doen. Dit sal daartoe aanleiding gee dat grondpryse goedkoper word. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek bedank die agb. Sweep vir die voorreg.</p>

<p>Ek wil net daarop wys dat indien die departement dit sou doen, dit onderworpe moet wees aan die voorwaarde dat sodanige grond nie vir herverkoop of spekulasie gebruik kan word nie. Dit is &#x2019;n euwel wat nie toegelaat kan word nie.</p>

<p>Wat plaaslike owerhede betref, wil ek &#x2019;n versoek tot die agb. Minister rig. In elke dorp of stad in Suid-Afrika is daar parkeerruimtes wat slegs vir daardie doel aangewend word. Daardie parkeerruimtes kan net so behou word, maar die grond kan teen &#x2019;n nominale bedrag verkoop of verhuur word vir die oprigting van woonstelle waarvan die huurgeld beheer kan word. Hulle kan ook bepaal dat sakepersele wat opgerig word wooneenhede sal insluit op voorwaarde dat geen verbeteringsheffing daarop betaal hoef te word nie.</p>

<p>Werkgewers moet ook in staat gestel word om persele in behuisingsprojekte vir Blankes en anderskleuriges te bekom sodat hulle self voorsiening kan maak vir die behuising van hulle werknemers. Sekere belastingvoordele kan hieraan gekoppel word. Die agb. Minister het ges&#x00EA; dat die private bedryfslewe geaktiveer moet word, maar die private bedryfslewe sal net geaktiveer word as &#x2019;n projek vir hulle voordele inhou.</p>

<p>Wat bestaande behuisingskemas betref, is oorbewoning &#x2019;n erkende feit. Mense wat &#x2019;n gebied oorbewoon, dra niks by tot die skepping van behuising vir hulself of vir andere nie. Ek wil vra dat hulle vir huur aangeslaan word ten opsigte van die eenheid wat hulle bewoon sodat kapitaal geskep kan word vir die verskaffing van verdere behuising.</p>

<p>Huurgelde van ou bestaande skemas moet realisties hersien word sodat hulle met betrekking tot nuwe skemas &#x2019;n gelykmatige bydrae kan lewer om behuisingsprobleme op te los.</p>

<p>Verder wil ek vra dat die departement grond moet onteien en aan nutsmaatskappye beskikbaar moet stel, byvoorbeeld die Stedelike Behuisingsbond in Kaapstad wat oor die jare deskundigheid op hierdie terrein opgebou het. Hierdie maatskappye kan &#x2019;n <span class="col_759-760" refersTo="page_0403"/>soortgelyke projek soos die Engelse New Town-stelsel op die been bring wat selfver-sorgend en selffinansierend kan wees.</p>

<p>Laastens, wil ek graag vra dat die kwessie van die onderverdeling van erwe, die goedkeuring van dorpstigting en alles wat gepaard gaan met prosedures vir die beskik-baarstelling van boupersele, vereenvoudig, verkort en soepeler gemaak moet word. Boukoste kan ook verlaag word deur gebruik te maak van die informele sektor. Die Buro vir Ekonomiese Ondersoek aan die Universiteit van Stellenbosch het byvoor-beeld bereken dat so iets tot &#x2019;n verlaging van 30&#x0025; in boukoste aanleiding kan gee.</p>

<p>Ek is ook van mening dat Blankes sal moet afsien van weeldebehuising. In Brit-tanje is die gemiddelde huisvestingsopper-vlakte van vyf mense 88,54 vk. meter, terwyl die ooreenstemmende oppervlakte in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plein meer as 100 vk. meter is. Na aanleiding hiervan besef &#x2019;n mens dat daar in hierdie verband ook moontlikhede bestaan.</p>

<speech by="#fouch&#x00E9;">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. F. FOUCH&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is persoonlik baie dank aan die agb. Minister verskuldig omdat hy vanmiddag weer die beleid van die Regering ten opsigte van behuising in Suid-Afrika so duidelik uitgespel het. Dit kom in kort daarop neer dat die voorsiening van behuising in die eerste plek by die individu berus. Dit is belangrik dat ons daarvan kennis sal neem.</p>

<p>Dit is so dat ons tydig en ontydig moet verneem dat daar gepoog word om pariteit met betrekking tot salarisse wat aan die verskillende bevolkingsgroepe betaal word, te bewerkstellig. Ek meen dit is goed, maar ons verneem egter so min van die kant van veral ons gekleurde mense dat hulle op &#x2019;n positiewe wyse hul kant wil bring ten opsigte van die voorsiening van behuising. Wat die Regering betref, het die agb. Minister dit vanmiddag baie duidelik gestel wat die posisie is. Ek wil graag na &#x2019;n paar statistieke in hierdie verband verwys. Ek wil spesifiek verwys na die getal huise wat oor die afgelope vyf jaar vir drie rassegroepe, te wete die Blankes, Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs, deur die Staat opgerig is. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens hierna kyk, sien jy dat die Regering sy kant gebring het. Oor die afgelope vyf jaar het die Regering 13,3&#x0025; van die Blanke behuising in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika voorsien. Die rede vir hierdie lae persentasie is omdat slegs 17&#x0025; van die Blanke bevolking wat vir Staatshuisvesting kwalifiseer, daarvan gebruik maak. Ten opsigte van die Kleurlinge het die Regering egter gedurende daardie vyf jaar 84&#x0025; van die huisvesting voorsien. Wat die Asi&#x00EB;rs betref, het die Regering 61&#x0025; van hulle huisvesting oor die-selfde tydperk voorsien.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is belangrik dat ons vanmiddag&#x2014;soos die agb. Minister ook gedoen het &#x2014;die privaatsektor en veral werkgewers opnuut sal wys op hulle verantwoordelik-heid. As ons kyk na die bedrag wat be-skikbaar is vir behuising in hierdie land, is dit duidelik dat ons sal moet wegkom van die idee van luukse huisvesting. Oor &#x2019;n tydperk van vyf jaar het die private sektor &#x2019;n bedrag van R4 000 miljoen bestee om 143 000 wooneenhede op te rig, terwyl die Staat vir minder as R2 000 miljoen oor die-selfde tydperk 103 000 wooneenhede opgerig het. Dit is dus duidelik dat ons wat behuising betref, sal moet wegkom van die idee van luukshede indien ons die behuisings-vraagstuk die hoof wil bied.</p>

<p>Aan Opposisiekant is daar vanmiddag na &#x2019;n krisis verwys. Ek verwys nie na die behuisingsprobleemin hierdie land as &#x2019;n krisis nie. Ek s&#x00EA; dat ons met &#x2019;n vraagstuk te kampe het. Laat ons nou kyk hoe die Regering in hierdie verband sy kant gebring het.</p>

<p>Daar is vanmiddag hier veral verwys na behuising vir Kleurlinge. Diegene wat die Erika Theron-verslag gelees het, weet dat die verslag in 1976, die lig gesien het en dat daar toe &#x2019;n tekort van 131 000 wooneenhede vir Kleurlinge in die Kaapse Skiereiland was. Die departement het nie daarvoor terugge-deins nie, maar het sy kant gebring. Ek kan vandag konstateer dat die tekort aan Kleurlingbehuising in die Kaapse Skiereiland vandag slegs 40 500 eenhede is. Hierdie verslag van vyf jaar gelede het verder verklaar dat daar 30 000 Kleurling-plakkers in die Kaapse Skiereiland was. Hierdie syfer is drasties verminder sodat dit vandag slegs 8 000 is. Dit is &#x2019;n geweldige prestasie wat die departement behaal het.</p>

<p>Ek wil vandag s&#x00EA;, en daar bestaan geen twyfel by my daaroor nie, dat groter druk op die werkgewer uitgeoefen moet word om huisvesting vir sy werknemers te voorsien. In hierdie verband wil ek my besondere dank en waardering uitspreek teenoor di&#x00E9; werkgewers wat tot dusver hulle kant gebring het. <span class="col_761-762" refersTo="page_0404"/>Ek wil verwys na &#x2019;n koerantberig van &#x2019;n paar dae gelede waarin ges&#x00EA; word dat een werk-gewer in Oos-Transvaal &#x2019;n bedrag van R12 miljoen beskikbaar gestel het vir die Swart werkers van die betrekke nywerheid. Dit is &#x2019;n mooi voorbeeld wat gestel word en ons moet daarop voortbou.</p>

<p>Met betrekking tot die verskaffing van behuising deur die private sektor en veral die werkgewer het ek een vrees waarop ek graag die agb. Minister se aandag wil vestig. Wanneer die werkgewer nie ook daarmee rekening hou dat hy die woning wat hy beskikbaar stel aan die werknemer te koop aanbied nie, kan ons in &#x2019;n stadium wanneer ons by welsynbehuising kom voor &#x2019;n probleemte staan kom, naamlik dat wanneer &#x2019;n man die beste van sy lewensjare gegee het aan &#x2019;n bepaalde werkgewer, hy op die ou end kan vind dat hy sonder behuising is. In hierdie verband dink ek dat die betaling van &#x2019;n behuisingsubsidie vir hierdie doel oorweeg moet word. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens kan selfs die private dorpsontwikkelaar by so &#x2019;n stelsel betrek sodat hy ook sy kant kan bring om welsynsbehuising te voorsien.</p>

<p>Die agb. Opposisie het vanmiddag weer na die plakkers verwys. Na my mening kan die behuisingsvraagstuk in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika net opgelos word as ons dit nie in die politieke arena insleep nie. Die kerk, die Staat en die private sektor moet almal betrek word om hulle deel by te dra. &#x2019;n Ene mnr. Kingsly het in opdrag van die Stadsraad van Pretoria Amerika in die laat sestigerjare besoek. Na aanleiding van sy besoek moes hy aan die Stadsraad van Pretoria verslag doen. Ons het vanmiddag van een van die agb. lede aan die oorkant van die Raad verneem dat sekere geboue gesloop word om plek te maak vir ander behuising. Ek wil net graag vir u noem wat in die Verenigde State gebeur het. Ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Between 1950 and 1960 the Urban Renewal Programme demolished 126 000 low-rent houses. It built only about 28 000 new houses during the period and the vast majority of those are in a much higher rent bracket than the ones they replaced. Thus the programme has improved housing for relatively high income groups only. The low income groups have been pushed into new slums. Some 6 000 people have been forced to pack their belongings and leave their houses by 1963.</block>

<p>Dan praat Biskop Tutu nog van die &#x201E;uprooting and dumping of God&#x2019;s children&#x201D;. Ek wil daardie agb. Biskop vanmiddag antwoord in die taal van &#x2019;n Swart man, &#x2019;n leier van die Church of Zion, wat by geleentheid toe hy meer as 2 miljoen Swart mense in Noord-Transvaal toegespreek het. Biskop Lek-ganyane het onder meer ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I side with Peter, chapter 2, verse 13, when he says: &#x201C;Submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the Lord&#x2019;s sake.&#x201D; The President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of State, chiefs and all members of the Administration are in authority over you. The laws of the country are God&#x2019;s laws, because of the preservation of peace and security. For all the highest possible states of happiness it is not for the individual to judge the law, but it is for the individual to obey the law.</block>

<p>Daardie man het met die volgende woorde afgesluit, en ek rig dit aan agb. lede aan daardie kant van die Raad sodat hulle daarvan kennis sal neem&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speak no corrupt words, but words that will benefit others. Put away all bitterness, wrath, clamour, evil speaking and malice. Know that the Christian faith is for the foundation of things we hope for. No building can be strong with a weak foundation, so a strong Christian character is dependent on strong faith. Let us cooperate and develop the potential peace with which we are born. Let us pray for the continuation of peace in our beloved country, the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have listened to the hon. member speaking and only one probleem arises from what he said as regards the private individual who has to build his own home. The probleem is that young people cannot accumulate the deposits that are necessary in order to be able to build their own homes. This is the basic probleem. They are unable to save the basic deposit.</p>

<p>I would like to deal with urban renewal. <span class="col_763-764" refersTo="page_0405"/>Most of our cities and towns in South Africa are between 50 and 300 years old. We are not a young country and are in fact as old as the United States of America. We differ in that we are both composed of First World and Third World components in the same economy, which aggravates our probleem. The development of our towns was at first very unsystematic, but since 1910 more efficient government has brought about a greater systematization with increased knowledge of town planning and improved building methods. Yet we must understand that there are two fundamental principles which we must bear in mind. Towns have been developed for the orderly survival of man. Secondly, as the poet Cowper said: &#x201C;God made the country, but man made the town&#x201D;. To enlarge, although man can be seen to have been made in the image of God, he certainly has not built the towns in that image.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Witbank mentioned the question of urban renewal in the United States of America. I would like to tell him that the United States Federal Urban Renewal Programme was launched in 1949 in terms of their Housing Act. In April 1972 the US Secretary for Housing and Urban Renewal stated that their renewal programme was a waste of the tax-payers&#x2019; money, and a factor in the decay rather than in the solution of inner cities. Mr. Chairman, the whole probleem was that the approach was completely and totally wrong. If there is any truth in the statement, how much more &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I do not have the time. How much more has South Africa been bedevilled by the unpalatable Group Areas Act which does not apply in the USA? I cannot agree with the attitude of the United States&#x2019; Secretary for Housing and Urban Development because I believe his interpretation of urban renewal as we now understand it, was wrong. In 1954 I stood for election as member for the Provincial Council in Jeppe. I walked the streets knocking on many doors and I saw, both from the inside of homes and from the outside, the insidious blight that was taking place in a section of Jeppestown. Upon my election I wrote a long letter &#x2026;</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. SIVE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not, I am quoting. Upon my election I wrote a long letter to and had many discussions with the Johannesburg City Engineer. Only fifteen years later, after the passing of the Community Development Act, did the necessary funds become available to allow a new housing scheme to be built in this area. The fact that the NP Member of Parliament subsequently took all the credit for this, is merely due to his human weakness. A few years later as Doomfontein started suffering from blight, I, at my own expense, drew up a plan for the redevelopment of that area. I saw the Management Committee of the Johannesburg Municipality and I also saw the Minister who was at that time Mr. Blaar Coetzee and the Secretary of the department, Mr. Fouch&#x00E9;. Now, 20 years later, Doomfontein is being redeveloped by private enterprise and will be called Ellispark. Because of my ignorance at the time I regret that I was wrong to believe that urban renewal should only be done by redevelopment. It is too slow and costly and means the replacement of people from areas where they have been living far too long. I have never recognized the inherent instinct of &#x201C;territorial imperative&#x201D;, for the animal, whether human or otherwise, wants to own his own piece of ground, his own stamping ground. To remove him entails terrible social and political problems. What necessitates urban renewal? Firstly, it is necessitated by population growth. However, this is complicated in South Africa by a multi-racial society. It is also necessitated by an increase in space requirements, especially in single-storey premises because of the improvement in technology. A bathroom today is a necessity, yet in 1902 Windsor Castle did not have a single bathroom for the King and Queen of England. Hot water had to be carried upstairs in cans for hip baths which were put in front of fires during the winter. Today, only 80 years later, a bathroom is considered to be essential. Urban renewal is also necessitated by a shift to low-density housing because we have become wealthier than the <span class="col_765-766" refersTo="page_0406"/>people of that time. There is also the question of the reduction in transport costs. However, this has changed and due to the increase in the price of oil our transport costs have increased. The other reason is the inter-dependence between certain service activities and the magnitude of sale demands at centrally situated locations. South African cities all show the tendency of urban sprawl by the addition of new townships on the periphery. A change in the above factors is bringing about a reverse trend back to the city centre where revitalization is necessary. There has been a higher rate of unbalanced growth because we have allowed the diversion of central city functions into areas that were originally planned for residential occupation. This may be necessary in the development of new towns and in the deconcentration of a metropolitan area but every move made must be seen in relation to its effect on the whole.</p>

<p>Urban renewal can be effected in three ways, namely conservation, rehabilitation and redevelopment. Conservation is the preservation of the quality of built-up areas and proves most effective in well-planned neighbourhoods where acceptable standards still prevail. It should be the first priority of the department to ensure that present housing and buildings are maintained. Rehabilitation means the revival of blighted areas, by the modernization and repair of buildings and the general improvement in community facilities. At last the Department of Community Development has come to realize the error of its ways in respect of District Six where flats have already been improved and a large number of houses are being repaired and modernized. Loader Street in Cape Town and Norwood in Johannesburg are wonderful examples of what private enterprise can do in regard to rehabilitation. With hind-sight it now appears that to have destroyed District Six, to have uprooted thousands of Coloureds and to have resettled them in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain&#x2014;excellent as it is&#x2014; has been a costly business both in money and sociological and political consequences. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister in regard to what he has said in connection with equality of opportunity. Now that he has made these houses available in District Six he must think about the question of whether they should be for Whites only because if that is the case, it will be a further blot on the escutcheon of the National Party. Places such as Pageview, the Edwardian village in Germiston West, the Athlone business area and Walker Estate should all fall under this area of rehabilitation. Georgetown, one of the adjoining sections of Washington, was a run-down area and it is now, after being rehabilitated, one of the most elegant and expensive parts of Washington. At this stage I want to pay tribute to the Portuguese immigrants who have lived in South Africa since the fall of Angola and Mozambique. They have been, for the most part, persons with little means. They have in my constituency, Bezuidenhout, and in adjoining constituencies, taken over homes which were showing signs of blight and have rehabilitated them. They have provided their own community facilities and they do not rely on State assistance. In the constituency of Bezuidenhout there are three very active and well-run Portuguese clubs. The two English-medium secondary schools, Athlone Boys High School and Athlone Girls High School, have a very high percentage of first generation South Africans of Portuguese origin. Rehabilitation will save an enormous amount of money. In Chapter 11 of the Report of the Director General for 1979-&#x2019;80 under the heading &#x201C;Rehabilitation of Depressed Areas&#x201D; it states that loans of up to R5 000 can be obtained from the department under certain conditions.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have mixed feelings about the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. Initially I thought that it was going to be a very good speech but it was inclined to sag towards the end as his microphone sagged. I have three points of criticism against his speech. The one is that he read his speech; secondly, he did not read it very well and thirdly there were parts that he should not have read as they were not worth while reading, especially towards the end of his speech. However, by and large, the hon. member has given me confidence in my esteem of people.</p>

<p>Ek het daardie agb. lid en ook die ander nuwelinge deurgekyk en aan myself ges&#x00EA; dat <span class="col_767-768" refersTo="page_0407"/>daar &#x2019;n agb. lid is wat &#x2019;n goeie bydrae gaan lewer en ek dink nie hy gaan my teleurstel nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het aanvanklik ges&#x00EA; ons jong mense het nie die vermo&#x00EB; om &#x2019;n deposito te bekom om &#x2019;n huis aan te skaf nie. So &#x2019;n deposito moet &#x2019;n kwart van die koopsom wees. Die agb. lid is mos egter daarvan bewus dat hierdie Regering &#x2019;n besparing-skema by ons bougenootskappe begin het wat met 2&#x0025; gesubsidieer word en dit is ook belastingvry.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Nee, dit neem nie so &#x2019;n lang tyd nie en die jong mense kan daardie fondse baie gou opbou. Daar is reeds 14 000 van hierdie rekeninge waarin &#x2019;n bedrag van R40 miljoen bel&#x00EA; is.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die beperkte tyd tot my beskikking wil ek praat oor welsyns-behuising en veral behuising vir ons senior burgers. Ek wil begin deur te s&#x00EA; dat die strategie sover dit voorsiening van behuising vir ons senior burgers betref op vier hoekstene berus. Die eerste en belangrikste hoeksteen is daardie trots en selfstandigheidsgevoel wat ons oues van dae het om in hul eie behuisingbehoeftes te voorsien. Dit is iets wat &#x2019;n mens nooit van hulle moet ontneem nie. Wanneer die bejaarde sy fisieke en soms ook sy geestelike kragte verloor het, glo ek dat dit die eer en voorreg van sy kind of familiebetrekking is om met Christelike verantwoordelikheid en met diepe deernis na die behoeftes van sy ouers om te sien. Ek ondersteun van harte die beroep van die agb. lid vir Vasco dat ons plaaslike ower-hede hul regulasies moet verslap sodat huiseienaars dit moontlik kan vind om ook &#x2019;n woonstel te bou vir die oues van dae of vir ander familiebetrekkinge. As dit dan moet gebeur dat die bejaarde nie self of met behulp van familie die mas kan opkom nie, is die derde hoeksteen die georganiseerde gemeenskap, die kerk en welsynsorganisasies. Hierdie diens wat gelewer word, is altyd &#x2019;n aanvullende diens en nooit &#x2019;n vervangende diens van wat die indiwidu en die familiebetrekkinge self kan lewer nie. Daar is ook &#x2019;n vierde hoeksteen en dit is die Staat met sy maatskaplike pensioene en sy ander toelaes asook sy lenings teen lae rentekoerse aan plaaslike owerhede, nutsmaatskappye, kerke en welsynsorganisasies. Dit is lenings wat toegestaan word teen &#x2019;n rentekoers van so laag as l/20ste persent terwyl die hoogste maar 1&#x0025; is. In die afgelope jaar het hierdie departement &#x2019;n bedrag van R22,5 miljoen aan welsynsbehuising vir blankes bestee en sover dit die Kleurlinge betref, is &#x2019;n bedrag van R4,5 miljoen bestee. In die afgelope drie jaar het ons &#x2019;n bedrag van R52,5 miljoen aan behuising vir ons senior burgers bestee. By wyse van &#x2019;n antwoord aan die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt kan ek s&#x00EA; dat dit bestee is afgesien van die normale bedrae wat beskikbaar gestel is vir konvensionele behuising van ons oues van dae. Ek verwys hier alleen na die bedrag van R52,5 miljoen wat bestee is aan die inrigtingsversorging van ons oues van dae.</p>

<p>Benewens die konvensionele konsep van &#x2019;n tehuis is daar vandag ook &#x2019;n nuwe benadering. Hierdie benadering is dat ons senior burgers so lank as moontlik in die gemeenskap moet behou en dat ons dan, as dit nodig is, deur middel van dienssentrums &#x2019;n aanvullende hulpdiens aan ons senior burgers lewer. Die dienssentrum is een van &#x2019;n trilogie van sentrums of komplekse vir die versorging van ons oues van dae. Die ideale toestand is dat hierdie drie komplekse verkieslik op een perseel sal wees.</p>

<p>In this threesome of centres we have in the first instance the home for the frail aged. The increased life expectancy means that in future there will be a very much greater need for these homes. We have in the second instance a complex of flatlets and cottages. They are today increasingly being financed by the tenants, the senior citizens themselves, where they have occupation for life. There are various formulas for the payment of the capital invested if they should leave those homes, flats or cottages or should they move on to the home for the frail aged. I am pleased to say that there are certain firms who are sponsoring these cottages for their retired employees. To complete this threesome we have the service centre where we have a dining hall that is also utilized as a games room and a venue for social gatherings. They also have a kitchen and very important, a clinic etc. The service centre not only caters for the needs of the tenants of the cottages and those in the <span class="col_769-770" refersTo="page_0408"/>homes for the frail agedbut&#x2014;and this is most important&#x2014;it also caters for the senior citizens in the immediate vicinity who are still living in their own homes. One of the biggest problems of our aged is their loneliness and in these service centres they cannot only have companionship but also a decent meal at least once a day and a clinic for their medical needs.</p>

<p>Ek sou wil sien dat hierdie konsep al meer uitgebrei word, ook na ons plattelandse dorpe. Indien ons ons oues van dae na die plattelandse dorpe wil trek moet ons sekere basiese fasiliteite daarstel. Daar moet &#x2019;n basiese infrastruktuur wees en ook &#x2019;n maat-skaplike infratruktuur. Ons het veral &#x2019;n hospitaal nodig.</p>

<p>Ek voorsien dat baie van die bestaande ouetehuise&#x2014;en daar is vandag haas nie &#x2019;n dorp op die platteland waar daar nie &#x2019;n ouetehuis is nie&#x2014;in die toekoms omskep sal word in tehuise vir verswakte oues van dae en dat ons baie van die huise wat leeg staan op ons plattelandse dorpe sal aanwend vir konvensionele behuising vir ons oues van dae.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ek s&#x00EA; aan die agb. Sweep baie dankie vir die vergunning. Die agb. Minister het vanmiddag aangedui dat &#x2019;n tekort van 20 000 huise vir die blankes ondervind word. Terwyl daar hierdie tekort is, is daar honderde huise wat onbenut staan op ons plattelandse dorpe. &#x2019;n Tyd gelede het ek &#x2019;n brief van &#x2019;n dame gelees en dit het my diep aangegryp. Ek het vanmiddag aan daar-die brief gedink toe die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt gepraat het van die baie pensioentrek-kers in sy kiesafdeling wat met hul beperkte pensioen eenvoudig nie meer die stygende woonstelhuur kan bekostig nie. Dit is &#x2019;n wesenlike probleem. Ek het &#x2019;n brief gelees van &#x2019;n weduwee wat dieselfde probleemin Johannesburg ondervind het want sy kon toe net nie meer bekostig om in die woonstel aan te bly nie. Sy lees toe dat die huishuur op die Vrystaatse dorpie Springfontein so laag is. Uit desperaatheid het sy besluit om na Springfontein te trek en sy s&#x00EA; dat dit die wonderlikste besluit van haar lewe was. Sy het na Springfontein gegaan weens finansi&#x00EB;le oorwegings maar sy het baie meer as finansi&#x00EB;le voordeel daar ontdek. Daar in die hart van die platteland het sy te doen gekry met die hartlikheid, die medemenslikheid en met die vriendskap van die plattelander en dit het haar lewe verryk. Sy s&#x00EA; dat haar enigste verwyt is dat sy nie baie jare vantevore daar-die besluit geneem het nie. Ek weet dat &#x2019;n beroep wat ek sal doen nie ons oues van dae in groot getalle sal wegkeer van die stede na die goedkoper behuising op die platteland nie. Ek weet ook dat &#x2019;n algemene beroep van die kant van ons plaaslike owerhede as hulle sou s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Kom woon in ons mooi dorp&#x201D; ook nie die gewenste uitwerking sou h&#x00EA; nie. Daarom wil ek &#x2019;n beroep op ons Volksraads-lede doen en hulle aanmoedig om met die plaaslike owerheid op hul dorpe te gesels en om ook met die welsynsorganisasies oorleg te pleeg met die oog op die beplanning van &#x2019;n georganiseerde promosieveldtog om die voordele van die platteland onder ons mense se aandag te bring. Daar is baie van daardie voordele en &#x2019;n mens kan hulle bv. van die finansi&#x00EB;le voordele vertel wat dit sou inhou. &#x2019;n Mens moet hulle egter veral vertel van die hartlikheid en die vriendelikheid en ook die meelewing van die plattelander want die grootste bate van die platteland is die gehalte van sy mense. &#x2019;n Mens moet hulle vertel dat daar op die platteland, in die laat aand van hul lewe, rus sal wees en, soos Eugene Marais ges&#x00EA; het: &#x201E;Hier sal ek vrede weer besef.&#x201D; Die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout praat van die mense wat die stad gemaak het, maar God het die natuur daarbuite gemaak, daar in die wonderlike platteland. Daar is die mens naby aan die dinge wat sy Skepper gemaak het en nie net by die teer-strate en die geboue wat die mens gemaak het nie. As dit dan moet, moet ons departement help om die lewe vir die oues van dae op die plattelandse dorp nog verder te verfyn en te veraangenaam deur die daar-stelling van dienssentrums. Dit is nie altyd nodig om &#x2019;n nuwe dienssentrum te bou nie want daar is baie bestaande kerksale en ander lokale wat vir hierdie doel omskep kan word. Ek glo dat daar ontsaglike moont-likhede is en ek dink dat dit nodig is dat veral ons verteenwoordigers op die platteland, terwyl ons van &#x2019;n Stedelike Stigting hoor, ook &#x2019;n Plattelandse Stigting sal vorm en met &#x2019;n promosieveldtog sal kom om die <span class="col_771-772" refersTo="page_0409"/>platteland onder die aandag van ons mense te bring.</p>

<p>Ek wil &#x2019;n woordjie oor gemeenskapsfasiliteite s&#x00EA; terwyl daar reeds oor daardie onderwerp gepraat is. Ek wil die agb. lid vir Faure-smith baie hartlik gelukwens met &#x2019;n stotterende toespraak. Dit is waar wat hy s&#x00EA; want die gemeenskap is baie meer as &#x2019;n klompie huise daar op die vaal vlaktes. Die departement se naam is die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling en nie die Departement van Behuising nie. Gemeenskapsontwikkeling behels baie meer as net die voor-siening van onderdak. As ons &#x2019;n volwaardige gemeenskap wil h&#x00EA;, moet daardie gemeenskap ook fasiliteite h&#x00EA; soos kerke, sale, sport-velde en sakepersele asook parke. Tot in 1974 was dit die verantwoordelikheid van plaaslike owerhede om in hierdie fasiliteite te voorsien. Hulle kon die mas nie opkom nie. In 1973 het die destydse Minister die Fouch&#x00E9;-kommissie aangestel om die hele aangeleentheid te ondersoek. Hulle het &#x2019;n interessante verslag die lig laat sien waarin o.m. aanbeveel word dat die Behuisingswet gewysig word sodat &#x2019;n 1&#x0025;-heffing geplaas kan word op huishuur en &#x2019;n 5&#x0025;-begiftiging op die verkoopprys van erwe sodat daardeur &#x2019;n fonds opgebou kan word vir die voorsie-ning van hierdie behuisingsfasiliteite. Ons het sedert daardie tyd vir Blankes &#x2019;n bedrag van R2,355 miljoen aan hierdie fasiliteite bestee, vir Kleurlinge nie minder nie as R20,83 miljoen en vir Indi&#x00EB;rs R5,5 miljoen. Omdat hierdie skema eers in 1979 begin is sover dit die Swartes betref, is R755 000 in hulle geval bestee. Hierdie fonds is egter nie toereikend nie. Daar is so &#x2019;n geweldige agterstand in die voorsiening van fasiliteite dat ons met hierdie fonds, wat hoofsaaklik opgebou word uit die 1&#x0025;-heffing, nie kan vorder nie. Daarom moet ons ook &#x2019;n gemeenskapsbetrokkenheid h&#x00EA;. Ons praat van die oop ruimtes in baie van ons Kleurling-en ander woonbuurtes, ruimtes wat dikwels net storttingsterreine geword het vir afval. Ek het netnou &#x2019;n beroep op ons verteenwoordigers gedoen om iets te doen om ons oues van dae na die platteland te lok, maar hulle kan ook &#x2019;n groot bydrae lewer in verband met die verfraaiing van baie van daardie vaal buurtes waar mense woon. Dit kan teen minimale koste gedoen word. Ek wil agb. lede vra of hulle nie sal gaan gesels met die plaaslike owerhede in hul dorpe nie en ook met die afdelingsrade en die bestuurskomitees. Kom ons mobiliseer die jong mense in ons kiesafdelings. Net &#x2019;n week gelede het &#x2019;n jong man van Bellville na my gekom. Hy het vir my ges&#x00EA; dat hulle klomp jong seuns iets wil doen saam met die jong Kleurlingmanne in verband met die verfraaiing van hul woonbuurt. Hulle wil eers gaan praat met die Afdelings-raad om te hoor of hulle nie &#x2019;n stootskraper aan hulle wil leen vir die dag nie en hulle gras-en struike kan gaan plant. Dit is moontlik om die gemeenskap betrokke by hierdie projekte te kry en dan kan ons teen minimale koste parke daarstel. As ons dit nie doen nie gaan ons net eenvoudig verdruk en verdring word in ons eie parke. Om dit moontlik te maak, is ek dankbaar om te kan aankondig dat die Kommissie vir Admini-strasie dit &#x2019;n tyd gelede goedgekeur het om &#x2019;n behuisingsbestuurder of &#x2019;n ombudsman in elk van ons streekkantore te h&#x00EA;. Die agb. lid vir Valsbaai het hieroor gepraat en vir my is dit baie aangenaam om dit te kan aankondig. Die taak van hierdie ombudsman sal wees om plaaslike besture te motiveer en te aktiveer om behuisingsprojekte wat deur die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds gefinansier is asook die terreine waarop die geboue staan en die ontspannings-en sportterreine wat deel van die gebied uitmaak, deurentyd in &#x2019;n netjiese toestand te hou. Dit sluit ook in die aanmoediging om tuinboukompetisies te hou. Hy moet verder aanbevelings doen aan die Nasionale Behuisingskommissie ten opsigte van metodes om plaaslike besture beter in staat te stel om behuisingsprojekte te onderhou. Hy sal waarnemingsinspeksies by behuisingsprojekte uitvoer met die oog op die identifisering van moontlike wantoe-stande. Hy sal wantoestande onder die aandag van die plaaslike besture bring as deel van die motivering-en aktiveringstaak. Hy sal skakel met bestuurskomitees en ander organisasies bv. ouer-en kerkverenigings met die doel om die bewoners van behuisingsprojekte te motiveer in verband met die versorging van eiendom en gemeen-skapsfasiliteite en-geriewe. Hy sal ook dien as ingangspunt met betrekking tot die aanhoor en hantering van probleme ten opsigte van die voorsiening van behuising. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling <span class="col_773-774" refersTo="page_0410"/>is seer sekerlik een van die belangrikste departemente van die Regering, Die daarstelling van geskikte en verbeterde huisvestiging sowel as gemeenskaplike geriewe, ontspannings-en opleidingsfasiliteite, is basiese benodigdhede wat bydra tot &#x2019;n gebalanseerde infrastruktuur. In die laaste drie dekades is dit besef dat die noodsaaklik-heid ontstaan het om sekere stedelike hernuwing-en ontwikkelingsprojekte te onderneem. Dit was die oorhoofse mening dat groot bedrae geld sowel as die daarstelling van sekere nywerheidsontwikkeling stelselmatig sou bydra dat minder ontwikkelde lande snel sou verander. Laasgenoemde ideale het nie tot stand gekom nie. Gou is gevind dat net die welgesteldes en groot besigheidsondememings uit hierdie situasie baat gevind het. Dit het gelei tot die ontstaan van die Departement van Gemeen-skapsontwikkeling. Die doelstellings en funksies van die Departement van Gemeenskap-sontwikkeling behels die ontwikkeling van gemeenskappe in al hul fasette, ekonomies, sosiologies en polities. Verder moet ook toegesien word dat persoonlike deelname aan alle gemeenskaplike aktiwiteite en ontwikkeling geskied. Gemeenskapsontwikkeling behels die volgende noodsaaklikhede: Eerstens, behels dit die verandering van gemeenskappe deur dienste te voorsien soos behuising, klinieke, skole en besigheidssen-trums. Tweedens, behels dit die bewerkstelliging van &#x2019;n veranderde leefwyse, gesind-heid en aanvaring van &#x2019;n nuwe gemeenskap en omgewing. Laasgenoemde faktore bewerkstellig &#x2019;n onafhanklikheidsin en bevorder &#x2019;n selfonderhoudende gees. Die eindresultaat is onteenseglik verhoogde trots in die omgewing waar hy homself bevind sowel as &#x2019;n hemude inisiatief. Die benadering van die departement is een van direkte betrokkendheid by gemeenskapsontwikkeling met die voorbehoud dat gemeenskappe &#x2019;n besliste vryheid van keuse het sover dit ontwikkeling betref. Gemeenskapsontwikkeling het sekere beliste funksies en dit word genoop om gemeenskappe van alle bevolkingsgroepe soms te hervestig in herontwikkelde gebiede. Die Behuisingswet van 1966 maak voorsiening dat die betrokke departement behuising aan al die bevolkingsgroepe moet voorsien. Hierdie Wet het die fonds bekend as die Nasionale Behuisings-fonds tot stand laat kom. Gevolglik is tot aan die einde van Maart 1981 die volgende huisvesting aan die verskillende bevolkingsgroepe voorsien: Asi&#x00EB;rs 53 784, Swartes 392 281, Kleurlinge 228 387 en Blankes 118 137. Die totaal beloop dus 792 589 wooneenhede.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. S. VAN EEDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, toe die debat verdaag is, het ek reeds ges&#x00EA; dat daar 792 589 wooneenhede aan verskillende bevolkingsgroepe be-skikbaar gestel is. Die Behuisingsfonds is jaarliks uit die Staatskas aangevul. Die aan-vangskapitaal van die Fonds was reeds in 1957 R218,5 miljoen. Teen die einde van Maart 1981 was dit R2 008 miljoen. Stedelike vernuwing is &#x2019;n pertinente funksie en dit is beslis nie daarop ingestel om nie-kwalifiserende bevolkingsgroepe te hervestig onder die Wet op Groepsgebiede nie. Die doel is uitsluitlik om slumsituasies wat ontstaan het, op te ruim en dit met sukses deur te voer. Die doel of funksie van gemeen-skapsrade is, <i>inter alia,</i> om liefs persone behulpsaam te wees om hul eie eiendomme te bekom in hul onderskeie gebiede, soos deur die Minister self afgebaken is. Stedelike vernuwing dien as hulpmiddel aan plaaslike besture. Die Departement van Gemeen-skapsbou is tans betrokke by &#x2019;n vemuwings-program wat alle groot stede in die Republiek behels.</p>

<p>Gemeenskapsontwikkeling is sedert 1964 met die opruiming van slumgebiede en stedelike vernuwing gemoeid. Van 1964 tot op hede is waardevolle inligting bekom, asook ondervinding opgedoen, gepaard met &#x2019;n in-tensiewe studie in di&#x00E9; verband. Die private sektor is in groot mate betrek by die ontwik-kelingsproses van di&#x00E9; komplekse. Behalwe astronomiese aankope van eiendomme, is groot bedrae aangewend om essensi&#x00EB;le dienste te verbeter. Projekte is selfs aangebring of onderneem om as stimulant te dien in sommige herontwikkelde of herbeplande vemuwingsgebiede.</p>

<p>Die belangrike aspek ten opsigte van stedelike vernuwing is die beskikbaarstelling van voldoende geriewe vir inwoners wat voorheen in ongewenste lewensomstandighede <span class="col_775-776" refersTo="page_0411"/>verkeer het. Plaaslike besture speel in di&#x00E9; verband ook &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol. Ongelukkig is hulle nie finansieel in die posisie om voldoende huisvesting en wat daarmee gepaard gaan, te voorsien nie en rus &#x2019;n groot verantwoordelikheid op die skouers van die sentrale Regering. Die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling word dus genoodsaak om na vore te tree om stedelike vernuwing en hervestiging te bewerkstellig.</p>

<p>Dit word ges&#x00EA; daar is geen beter tyd as die hede nie. Daarom glo ek dat dit &#x2019;n gele&#x00EB; tyd is om die agb. Minister te vra dat daar dringend na die middestadgebied van Germiston gekyk sal word. Daar is reeds in die laat sestigerjare met stedelike vernuwing &#x2019;n aanvang geneem, maar die proses het in die sewenti-gerjare basies tot stilstand gekom. Konser-watief geskat, l&#x00EA; tussen 20 ha en 30 ha van die middestadgebied leeg. Dit het &#x2019;n baie negatiewe uitwerking op die stad se vooruitgang. Daarom wil ek van hierdie geleentheid gebruik maak om die agb. Minister en sy departement te vra dat daardie grond &#x00F2;f deur die departement self ontwikkel word &#x00F2;f dat dit aan die private sektor beskikbaar gestel word om die ontwikkeling daarvan te onderneem. Verder wil ek ook vra dat daar spoedig gekyk sal word na die oprigting van die nuwe polisiekompleks wat reeds in die vooruitsig gestel is. Ek vra dan ook dat ons spoedig sal kyk na die hervestiging van ons Indi&#x00EB;r-en Kleurlinggemeenskappe na Palm Ridge en Eden Park. Dan, met die oog op die hervestiging van die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap, vra ek dat daar ook spoedig gekyk sal word na die beoogde Oriental Plaza wat daar vir di&#x00E9; mense in die vooruitsig gestel is. Ten slotte wil ek die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout vra om hom nie te skaar by die Edwardian Symphony nie, want ek kan hom die verse-kering gee dat die viool se snare lank reeds af is.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, verskeie agb. lede het hulle in die debat oor huurbeheer uitgelaat. Ek weet dat dit een van die moeilikste probleme is waarmee ons in die departement te kampe het. Dit is ook een van die nypende vraagstukke in baie van die agb. lede se kiesafdelings, en veral in kiesafdelings soos di&#x00E9; van die agb. lede vir Groenpunt en Seepunt en al die ander stedelike komplekse.</p>

<p>En Hillbrow.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, Hillbrow miskien ook. Ek neem dit dus nie die agb. lede kwa-lik dat hulle vandag hul probleme hier gestel het nie&#x2014;sommige met perspektief en ander meer met hul hart as met hul verstand. Elke lid moet hier sy saak bepleit.</p>

<p>Wat die hele aangeleentheid van huurbeheer betref, wil ek herhaal wat ek in die sen-suurdebat vroe&#x00EB;r vanjaar ges&#x00EA; het toe ek die Regering se beleid ten opsigte van huurbeheer baie duidelik uitgespel het. Die Regering het hom verbind om huurbeheer uit te faseer en die Regering staan by daardie onderneming. Onder heersende omstandig-hede, waar die tekort aan Blanke behuising toeneem, huurgelde steeds styg, die private sektor nog geen noemenswaardige bydrae tot die daarstelling van huureenhede gelewer het nie en toestande gevolglik hoogs uitbuit-baar is, kan daar in hierdie stadium egter nie met die uitfasering van huurbeheer voortgegaan word nie. Eers wanneer toestande op die behuisingsfront weer normaal is, kan die Regering verder aan hierdie saak aandag gee.</p>

<p>Die geweldige oplewing in die ekonomie, die styging in boukoste en rentekoerse, die invloei van duisende immigrante, die ho&#x00EB; lewenspeil met gepaardgaande groter aanvraag na behuising, die wyse waarop oorvloedige behuisingslenings teen die einde van verlede jaar bekombaar was en die stygende eiendomsbelasting en diensgelde van plaaslike owerhede is alles faktore wat daartoe bygedra het om huurgelde skerp te laat styg. Wanneer ons oor hierdie sake praat, is dit noodsaaklik dat ons met hierdie realiteite rekening sal hou. Wanneer die Kaapse stadsraad &#x2019;n spesiale belastingheffing van 28&#x0025; op woonstelle in sy gebied opl&#x00EA;, hoe kan ek verwag dat die woonsteleienaar die verhoging van sy huurgelde tot 10&#x0025;, 12&#x0025; of 15&#x0025; sal beperk? Ongelukkig is die situasie tans hoogs uitbuitbaar. In die afgelope nege maande het my departement absoluut &#x2019;n hel deurgemaak in verband met hierdie aangeleentheid. Daar het van alle kante klagte in-gekom en daardie klagte is natuurlik met die verkiesing aangewakker. Elke agb. lid het op hierdie tamboer geslaan. Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt en andere het absoluut niks ontsien om van hierdie aspek politiek te maak nie. Ek gun hulle dit natuurlik.</p>

<p><span class="col_777-778" refersTo="page_0412"/>Die agb. lid vir Hillbrow het ges&#x00EA; dat ons oor die afgelope nege maande, of ses maande, meer as 600 klagte ondersoek het. Ek moes my departement uit sekere sektore terugtrek&#x2014;ons het soos ander departemente ook maar die probleemvan &#x2019;n personeelte-kort&#x2014;ek moes die personeel oortyd laat werk en ek moes spesiale mense in diens neem om saam met die huurrade elkeen van hierdie gevalle te ondersoek, en ek dink hierdie mense het &#x2019;n wonderlike stuk werk gedoen. Ek dink hulle het hulle uitstekend van hultaak gekwyt. In die meeste gevalle was die klagte ongegrond. Agb. lede weet dit. Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt het daarna verwys. &#x2019;n Mens moet nie veronderstel dat al die huis eienaars uitbuiters is nie. Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt het heeltemal korrek ges&#x00EA; dat dit in uitsonderlike gevalle is dat mense hulle hier te buite gegaan het. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, het my departement hierdie klagte een vir een ondersoek en in die meeste gevalle kon daar nie uitbuiting bewys word nie. Natuurlik het huurgelde tot op &#x2019;n sekere vlak gestyg. Ons moes dit aanvaar. Ek moet dit nou nog aanvaar. In die gevalle waar daar wel buitengewone groot verhogings van huur was, het my personeel as skakelbeamptes opgetree en het hulle met die mense onderhandel en in die oorgrote meerderheid van die gevalle het die bedryf saamgewerk en het ons &#x2019;n <i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i>-re&#x00EB;ling getref. Al was dit, soos die agb. lid vir Seepunt ges&#x00EA; het, nie die gewenste of ideale oplossing nie, kon ons darem in die meeste van hierdie gevalle die mense oorreed om nie buitengewone hure te hef nie en kon die hure dus binne redelike perke gehou word. Dit spreek boekdele vir die optrede van die amptenare van die departement.</p>

<p>Daar was natuurlik &#x2019;n paar uitsonderings waarvoor ek nou ook al weer geblameer word. In drie gevalle kon ek net nie die samewerking van die betrokkenes kry nie en het ek huurbeheer ingestel. Ten opsigte van een geval het die agb. lid vir Hillbrow my beskuldig van &#x2019;n &#x201E;breach of faith&#x201D; en &#x201E;breaking a promise&#x201D; waar die Regering die versekering gegee het dat huurbeheer nie op wooneenhede van ná 1966 ingestel sal word nie, maar ek het my niks te verwyt dat ek huurbeheer ten opsigte van die betrokke woonstelblok ingestel het nie.</p>

Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt en die agb. lid vir Kaapstad-Tuine het vir my geskrywe oor sulke gevalle terwyl hulle geweet het dat dit plekke was wat ná 1966 vir die eerste keer betrek is. Hulle het my gevra om in daardie gevalle op te tree. Ek het dit egter nie gedoen nie. In daardie gevalle is &#x2019;n re&#x00EB;ling getref.

Maar hulle is te bang vir hul eie mense want h&#x00FA;l mense is die eiendomsontwikkelaars, h&#x00FA;l mense is die &#x201E;fat cats&#x201D; wat die mense so uitbuit. Ek wil h&#x00EA; die agb. lede moet nou uit hul gate kruip en &#x2019;n slag opstaan, soos ek hier opgestaan het, en s&#x00EA; dat die Regering huurbeheer gaan uitfaseer. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle het nie die moed van hul oortuiging om vir my te s&#x00EA; hulle staan by my nie. Skaam hulle hulle nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Ek wil h&#x00EA; die agb. lede moet net nie altyd kritiseer nie. Hulle moet &#x2019;n slag ophou om &#x2019;n politieke speelbal hiervan te maak. Die verkiesing is nou verby. Hulle moet nou die moed van hul oortuiging h&#x00EA; om vir die Regering te s&#x00EA; hulle staan by ons ten opsigte van die uitfasering van huurbeheer en ons dán vir dit en dat vra. Dan kan ek met hulle debatteer. Dan kan ek met hulle &#x2019;n &#x201E;meaningful debate&#x201D; aanknoop. Maar op die oomblik het hulle waaragtig nie die moed van hul oortuigings nie. Hulle moet die saak maar aan my oorlaat. Ek wil vir hulle s&#x00EA; dit s&#x00EA; baie vir die voetwerk van die departement dat te midde van al hierdie probleme daar so min in die politieke arena van behuising gemaak is soos ons in die afgelope tyd gesien het. Ek neem die agb. lede nie hul standpunt kwalik nie. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, is hulle politici en moet hulle maar doen wat hulle nodig ag.</p>

<p>Ek wend my nou tot ander sake. Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt het oor aspekte van groepsgebiede gepraat.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. V. RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, voordat ons daarvan afstap, mag ek die agb. Minister vra of hy dit as billik beskou dat die huur van &#x2019;n beskermde huurder met 50&#x0025;, 60&#x0025; of 70&#x0025; verhoog word deur die departement se huurraad?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Die huurrade is statut&#x00EA;re liggame wat hure moet vasstel volgens die vier norme wat in die Wet uitgespel word en wat die agb. lid ken. Daarin kan ek nie inmeng nie. Siegs die Huurbeheerraad in Pretoria kan op app&#x00E8;l op daardie aangeleenthede ingaan. Dit is egter heeltemal reg dat, soos die agb. lid ges&#x00EA; het, &#x2019;n huurraad vandag met inagneming van daardie norme sodanige huurgelde kan hef. Ek het dit in my eie kiesafdeling ervaar. Dit hang natuurlik van omstandighede af. As daar oor &#x2019;n tydperk van, s&#x00EA; maar, drie jaar geen aansoek vir huurverhoging by die huurraad was nie en die betrokke eiendom is aan &#x2019;n nuwe eienaar verkoop wat dan by die huurraad aansoek om &#x2019;n verhoging doen, sal die huur natuurlik met 50&#x0025; verhoog word omdat die huurraad dit ná drie jaar skielik by die realistiese situasie moet aanpas. &#x2019;n Mens moet dus in daardie geval nagaan hoe hure in die tussentyd verander het.</p>

<p>Ek kom later ten opsigte van ander sake <span class="col_781-782" refersTo="page_0414"/>by die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt terug. Die agb. lid vir Groenpunt het oor aspekte met betrekking tot groepsgebiede gepraat. Ek sal more daaroor praat. In di&#x00E9; verband het ek iets om aan hom te s&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het dit ook gehad oor sekere ideologiese aangeleenthede en sake waarvan hy self ges&#x00EA; het dat dit niks met my te doen het nie. Hy het oor laekostebehuising gepraat. Met baie van wat hy in di&#x00E9; verband ges&#x00EA; het, stem ek saam. Hy het ook verwys, soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, na die goeie woonsteleienaars wat daar ook is. Ek stem met hom saam.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout het van stadsvernuwing gepraat en ges&#x00EA; ons moet meer nadruk op die aspekte van bewaring en rehabilitasie l&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>I can say that we have indeed achieved remarkable successes where others have failed. We do undertake restoration wherever possible. The Director-General of the department in 1973 headed a committee which went abroad to study restoration and prevention of decay.</p>

<p>Dit is nie die geval dat ons net altyd geboue wil omstoot nie. Ek het hier brie-we&#x2014;ek sal dit nie lees nie, want ek het nie baie tyd nie&#x2014;waarin die Raad vir Nasionale Gedenkwaardighede ons loof vir ons werk met betrekking tot restourasie en bewaring. Die agb. lid het &#x2019;n goeie bydrae gelewer. Hy het op &#x2019;n paar sake gewys waarna &#x2019;n mens kan kyk. Hy het onder meer&#x2014;dit ter wille van die agb. lid vir Jeppe&#x2014;gewag gemaak van wat die Portugese gemeenskap doen op die gebied van die skepping van behuising deur die restourasie van ou geboue. Hy het ook gewag gemaak van die opofferings wat hulle doen om hul eie gemeenskapsgeriewe te bekom. Ek dink die agb. lid slaan daardie spyker op die kop. Ek kan oor hierdie aangeleenthede volmondig met hom saamstem. Ek dink die agb. lid vir Jeppe stem ook met hom saam. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Nou kom ek by die agb. lid vir Witbank, wat &#x2019;n baie interessante toespraak gelewer het. Hy het onder meer verwys na die prestasies van die departement op verskeie terreine. Hy het een belangrike saak geopper, en dit is dat ons meer druk sal moet uitoefen op die werkgewer om &#x2019;n groter aandeel ten opsigte van behuising op hom te neem. Dit is absoluut noodsaaklik. &#x2019;n Ander baie belangrike aspek wat die agb. lid byge-voeg het, is dat die werkgewer ook aange-moedig moet word om met die hulp wat hy verleen, huiseienaarskap te bevorder. Dit is &#x2019;n baie belangrike aspek en ek stem in di&#x00E9; verband met die agb. lid vir Witbank saam.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Newton Park het verskeie aangeleenthede geopper. Een daarvan was die kwessie van plakkers. Ek wil vanaand vir die Komitee s&#x00EA; dat vandat ons in 1975 die plakkerwetgewing van die Departement van Justisie oorgeneem het&#x2014;ons het in 1976-&#x2019;77 sekere veranderings in daardie wetgewing aangebring&#x2014;ons nie met Kleurlingplakkers en Indi&#x00EB;rplakkers probleme het nie. Die agb. lede kan maar die departement daaroor vra. Ek wil vir die agb. lid vir Umbilo toegee dat ons nog hier en daar in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n plakkersdorp het. Dit is &#x2019;n realiteit wat ons aanvaar. Ons het dit hier in my kiesafdeling. Ons het dit in Elsiesrivier. Ons het dit ook in die Indi&#x00EB;rdorp aan die Suidkus waarna ek nou die dag gaan kyk het. Wat is nou weer die plek se naam? [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Ja. Meneer, ek het in my lewe nog nooit so &#x2019;n slum gesien nie. Ek het daar gaan kyk. Ek het by die slumgebied ingegaan. Selfs die lede van die Indi&#x00EB;rraad wou nie saam met my daar ingaan nie. Daar is nog sulke plekke. Dit is realiteite wat ons aanvaar. Ons beheer hulle, soos die agb. lid vir Umbilo ook ges&#x00EA; het. Ons merk die hutte en ons aanvaar die situasie totdat ons alternatiewe behuising beskikbaar kan stel. Dit is egter nie deel van ons behuisingstrategie nie. Dit is dinge wat ons nog moet opruim. Daardie slums bestaan nog. Afgesien van die klein kolletjies plakkers wat ons vandag nog het, het ons egter nie meer moeilikheid in hierdie land met Indi&#x00EB;r-en Kleurlingplakkers nie. Ons het ons probleme in di&#x00E9; verband byna opgelos.</p>

<p>Wat die agb. lid vir Fauresmith betref, het die agb. Adjunk-minister reeds op hom geantwoord. Dan is daar die agb. lid vir <span class="col_783-784" refersTo="page_0415"/>Germiston. Hy het oor verskeie aangeleent-hede gepraat, onder meer stadsvemuwing. Ek weet dat hy baie in stadsvemuwing belang stel, juis omdat daar so &#x2019;n vrot kol in sy stad is wat nog opgeruim moet word. Ek wil vir hom s&#x00EA; ek begryp sy probleme. Ek besef hy het werklik moeilike probleme daar. Ek sal na hom toe kom, so teen die einde van volgende maand, as die Here my spaar. Ek sal self kom kyk na projekte soos die polisiekompleks, die Edwardian Village waaroor die koerante so baie skryf, Palm Ridge, Eldorado Park en die Oriental Plaza. Die agb. lid kan my daarheen neem sodat ek dit met my eie o&#x00EB; kan sien. Ons sal so &#x2019;n bietjie na sy probleme daar gaan kyk en vasstel wat ons daaraan kan doen.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Vasco het oor &#x2019;n klomp aangeleenthede gepraat, amper soos die agb. lid vir Seepunt. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. T. VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Daar is darem &#x2019;n kwaliteitsverskil.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, die kwaliteit verskil seker &#x2019;n bietjie, maar ek sal nie op die meriete daarvan ingaan nie. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, het die agb. lid &#x2019;n paar belangrike sake geopper waaroor ek wil praat. Ek stem met hom saam dat huurbeheer nie &#x2019;n oplossing bied nie. Ons moet liewers daarvan wegkom as ons eendag in die posisie is om dit te kan doen. Soos ek na hom gesit en luister het, het hy hier baie mooi voorstelle gedoen, byvoorbeeld oor bougenootskappe. Dit was egter vir my &#x2019;n bietjie te vinnig om my heeltemal te be&#x00EF;ndruk. [Tussenwerpsels.] Bougenootskappe val natuurlik onder die Minister van Finansies. Nietemin dink ek dat daar heelwat meriete in die voorstelle van die agb. lid is. Ek wil hom vra om asseblief in verband met die bougenootskappe &#x2019;n bietjie vollediger gemotiveerde voorstelle aan my of deur die departement aan die Adviserende Komitee oor Behuisingsaangeleenthede te stuur&#x2014;&#x2019;n beampte van die Departement van Finansies dien in daardie komitee. Dan sal ons in daardie komitee hierdie aangeleent-heid uitstryk en nagaan watter van die voorstelle ons kan aanvaar. Ek dink die agb. lid het daar &#x2019;n paar goeie voorstelle beet. Ek kompromiteer my natuurlik nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook gepraat van boupersele wat ons moet verkoop. Ek het reeds ges&#x00EA; dat dit ons beleid is om ons al meer toe te l&#x00EA; op die skepping van die infrastruktuur en die daarstelling van boupersele. Ons het natuurlik altyd &#x2019;n voorkoopreg van vyf jaar in hierdie verband. Ek dink dat ons dit ernstig moet oorweeg om in die toekoms waar ons nuwe projekte goedkeur, die plaaslike besture te vra&#x2014;ons kan hulle natuurlik nie dwing nie&#x2014;om meer erwe vir daardie projekte beskikbaar te stel wat aan die publiek te koop aangebied kan word.</p>

<p>Ek kan nie die plaaslike besture forseer om in hul bouregulasies voorsiening te maak daarvoor dat sekere gedeeltes van geboue woonstelle moet bevat nie. Dit is natuurlik &#x2019;n goeie gedagte wat ons behoort verder te voer. Dit is vir my net verstandig. Ons moet die mense na die middestad terugbring. Ons moet in boukomplekse ruimte laat vir, s&#x00EA; maar, drie vloere van woonstelle sodat ons weer mense in die stad sal h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Wat die verskaffing van behuising deur werkgewers betref, is daar reeds &#x2019;n klein toegewing in hierdie verband gedoen: 50&#x0025; van &#x2019;n bedrag tot R4 000 is aftrekbaar vir doeleindes van die inkomstebelasting van werkgewers wat behuising verskaf. Die oorbly-wende bedrag kan dan natuurlik oor vyf jaar afgeskryf word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook die kwessie van oor-bewoning geopper. Hy wil h&#x00EA; dat ons &#x2019;n heffing moet plaas op die bywoners in oorbe-woonde behuising of dat ons hulle moet belas. Ek glo nie ons kan in di&#x00E9; opsig veel vermag nie want dit is die armstes onder die armes wat bywoners is. Ek glo nie ons sal veel uit hulle kry as ons &#x2019;n heffinkie op hulle plaas nie. Dan kan ons ook nog van Staatswee daarvan beskuldig word dat ons oorbe-woning aanmoedig om munt daaruit te slaan.</p>

<p>Ek meen die agb. lid het ook die kwessie van die hersiening van die huurgeld van ou skemas geopper. Dit is &#x2019;n saak waarna ek so &#x2019;n bietjie sal moet kyk. Die departement het dit al &#x2019;n slag oorweeg. Dit is egter nie so maklik om dit in te faseer nie, want daar is gewoonlik &#x2019;n geweldige bohaai selfs wanneer daar net &#x2019;n klein huurverhoginkie ingestel word. Daarmee moet ons rekening hou.</p>

<p>Dan het die agb. lid ges&#x00EA; ons moet meer hulp verleen aan behuisingsnutsmaatskap-pye. Die agb. lid vir Seepunt het ook daarna verwys. I am all for it. Dit is een van my babatjies wat ek graag wil &#x201E;nurse&#x201D;. Ek dink ons het glad te min van hierdie liggame in <span class="col_785-786" refersTo="page_0416"/>Suid-Afrika. Hulle kan &#x2019;n geweldige bydrae lewer en, wat meer is, ons kan hulle help, omdat hulle nie profyte maak nie&#x2014;en di&#x00E9; wat hulle maak, ploeg hulle weer terug. Ons gaan dus uit ons pad uit om hierdie behuisingsnutsmaatskappye van die grond af te kry, en ons sal in toenemende mate hulle kan help met advies, tegniese advies, en natuurlik deur vir hulle infrastrukture en persele te skep sodat hulle van die grond af kan kom. Dit geld veral die nuwes. Nou is dit egter ook so dat ek nie grond vir hulle kan onteien nie; dit sal nie reg wees nie. Die departement en plaaslike owerhede kan wel grond onteien, en dan kan hulle dit aan die nutsmaatskappye oordra. Meneer, ek kan nou nie ingaan op al die aspekte wat die agb. lid genoem het nie, maar ek meen ek het darem &#x2019;n hele paar van hulle in die gouig-heid behandel. Dit was &#x2019;n baie voortreflike toespraak wat die agb. lid vir Vasco gehou het.</p>

<p>Ek kom nou by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Bellville. Ek het &#x2019;n paar antwoorde aan die agb. lid vir Bellville gegee, maar hy het nog drie aanbevelings gemaak. In die eerste plek het hy aan die hand gedoen dat leningsmagte aan die Nasionale Behuisings-kommissie gegee moet word. Dit is &#x2019;n saak wat ons self al by die Tesourie bepleit het. Tot dusver wou hulle nog nie daartoe in-gestem het nie. Hulle weet beter wat die algemene en die totale belang van Suid-Afrika is, en ons moet maar hulle re&#x00EB;ling in hierdie verband aanvaar.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook die mening uitge-spreek dat die departement onthef moet word van die las ten opsigte van die lening van R150 miljoen wat ons drie of vier jaar gelede gekry het van &#x2019;n konsortium maatskappye. Ons is reeds besig om daaroor met die Tesourie te onderhandel. Reeds vanjaar het ons uitstel gekry ten opsigte van die kapitaal en rente wat ons moes terugbetaal. Ons hoop dat ons nog daarin sal slaag om uitein-delik uit hierdie verpligting weg te kom.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Ander aanbeveling wat die agb. lid gemaak het, is dat ons nie rente op die kapitaal wat ons van die Tesourie kry, moet betaal nie. Ek stem met hom saam. Vanjaar het ons dit werklik reggekry; vanjaar betaal ons nie rente nie. Maar, Meneer, dit beteken natuurlik nie dat ons meer geld kry nie, want die feit dat ons nie rente betaal nie word in aanmerking geneem by die bewilliging wat ons van die Tesourie kry. Die beginsel is egter aanvaar.</p>

<p>I should now like to turn to the hon. member for Umbilo. As the hon. member is aware, some of the worst slums and squatter conditions were to be found in those areas which he mentioned. The clearing up of those conditions required a tremendous amount of time, capital and effort. The areas had to be completely replanned, and new services had to be provided. To achieve this the authorities were obliged to acquire all the properties in the areas concerned. The aforementioned steps have already been completed, except in the case of Cato Manor where, on account of its reproclamation as an Indian group area, the replanning, which had already been finalized, had to be revised to cater for the particular needs of the Indian community. Land in Block AK, worth millions of rand, has already been marketed and several sites have been sold to private developers. In Mangrove Park and Umgeni Park almost all the sites have already been sold. The properties sold in this manner are rateable, and therefore provide additional revenue for the City Council of Durban.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Langlaagte het verwys na die onwettige indringing van Indi&#x00EB;rs en die wyse waarop hulle uitgebuit word deur eienaars wat plekke onwettig aan hulle verhuur. Ek sal hom m&#x00F4;re daaroor antwoord, as die liewe Here my spaar. Ek sal dan ook antwoord op die kwessie van Mayfair-Oos.</p>

<p>In verband met Crown Gardens wil ek die volgende antwoord aan die agb. lid verstrek: Ons het aan die einde van verlede jaar &#x2019;n aansoek by die stadsraad ingedien vir die onderverdeling van huise en die verslapping van bouregulasies ten opsigte van brand-mure. Aansoeke vir projektewysigings is tegelykertyd by die Provinsie ingedien. In beide gevalle het ons nog nie uitsluitsel gekry nie. Intussen is tenders aanvaar vir die voorsiening van aparte dienste aan die verskillende eiendomme. Dit is waar ons op die oomblik in die geval van Crown Gardens staan.</p>

<p>Wat dorpsontwikkeling betref, kan ek aan die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat, nadat die Fouch&#x00E9;-kommissie van ondersoek na behuisingsaan-geleenthede in 1976 lang vertragings met die finalisering van dorpstigtingaansoeke geldentifiseer <span class="col_787-788" refersTo="page_0417"/>het as een van die redes vir die styging in huispryse, die kommissie &#x2019;n groot aantal aanbevelings gemaak het, waarvan die meeste reeds aanvaar en uitgevoer is. Hierdie aanbevelings het onder andere die volgende behels: Die registrasie van dorpstigters; die beperking van dorpstigtingsterreine tot diegene wat dit werklik kan hanteer; die uitskakeling van vertragings met kommen-taarlewering deur Staatsdepartemente en-instansies; die uitskakeling van vertragings met moontlike paaienetwerke, soos byvoor-beeld in die PWV-netwerk; die stroombelyning van prosedures en die uitskakeling van rompslomp, wat baie fasette insluit. Om te verseker dat hierdie probleemop &#x2019;n deurlopende basis aandag geniet, het die kommissie in 1978 &#x2019;n Adviserende Komitee vir Behuisingsaangeleenthede en &#x2019;n Behuisings-adviesraad in die lewe geroep. Nou kry die aangeleentheid deurlopend aandag. As &#x2019;n bewys dat dorpstigting nou baie vinniger plaasvind, kan ek meld dat die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling, wat oor die jare heen talie dorpe gestig het, ongeveer 4 tot 5 jaar gelede tot 5 jaar gesukkel het om &#x2019;n dorp gestig te kry, terwyl dit tans dikwels gebeur dat &#x2019;n dorp binne &#x2019;n jaar na aansoek van die dorpsgebied geproklameer word. Ek dink dit behoort aan die agb. lid te toon dat ons darem ook op hierdie gebied besig is om te vorder.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Valsbaai het &#x2019;n paar aan-geleenthede genoem, waarop ek reeds geantwoord het. Ek het reeds geantwoord op die kwessie van &#x2019;n prestige-woonbuurt vir Kleurlinge. Op die kwessie van die ombudsman is reeds deur die agb. Adjunk-minister geantwoord. Die vraag oor die Louw-komitee is ook reeds beantwoord. Met die kwessie van onwettige okkupasie sal ek more handel.</p>

<p>Dan is daar nog een of twee aangeleent-hede wat ek graag wil behandel. Die eerste het te doen met Laingsburg, wat die agb. lid namens die agb. lid vir Beaufort-Wes geop-per het. Hierdie departement het met sy aksie in hierdie hele heropbouprogram in die geval van Laingsburg prysenswaardige sukses behaal. Ek wil nie vanaand die hele aangeleentheid bespreek nie, maar ek meen dat ons manne in hierdie geval eenvoudig wonderlike werk in die kortste tydbestek verrig het. Slegs 21 wonings in Laingsburg is nie deur die vloed daar noemenswaardig beskadig nie. Met die nouste samewerking van die ander instansies wat daarby betrokke was, het ons die hele Laingsburg herbeplan. &#x2019;n Nuwe boulyn is vasgel&#x00EA;, en die oprigting van nuwe strukture onder die boulyn sal verbied word. Alle beskikbare, onbeboude persele word deur die departement bekom, en word gekonsolideer en in kleiner maar nogtans aanvaarbare groottes heronderverdeel. Waar geboue herstel kan word, is leiding aan die eienaars gegee oor hoe daar te werk gegaan moet word. Twee nuwe dorpsge-biede is beplan en voorlopig is erwe uitgepen. Die beplanning van dienste het ook ver gevorder. Daar is met alle betrokkenes onderhandel om hulle behuisingsbehoeftes te bepaal. Die kontrakteur wat aangestel is om die puin op te ruim se werk is so te s&#x00EA; afgehandel, behalwe in die geval van die ou begraafplaas. Die tender het R600 000 beloop. Laingsburg is intussen met 154 tyde-like huise voorsien, vir diegene wat sodanige huisvesting benodig. Tenders vir die oprigting van 160 nuwe wonings te Laingsburg word in Oktober vanjaar uitgestuur, en in die kort tydperk van 9 maande is die opruiming van die puin en die herbeplanning van die dorp voltooi, terwyl die eerste nuwe huise binne enkele maande sal begin verrys. Dit dan, Meneer, ten opsigte van die mooi werk wat ons departement op Laingsburg gedoen het.</p>

<p>Dan het die agb. lid gepraat van die reg wat administrasierade het om permitte toe te ken vir Swartes om in Blanke gebiede te woon. Sover ons weet, word slegs Swart diplomate en Swart verteenwoordigers van ander Regerings in Blanke gebiede toege-laat, tesame met bona fide-bediendes, wat op plase of in stadsgebiede by huise werk. Daar is ko&#x00F6;rdinasie; die twee departemente raadpleeg mekaar oor en weer wanneer sulke permitte uitgereik moet word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het &#x2019;n baie interessante artikel aangehaal uit <i>Tegniek,</i> asook &#x2019;n ope brief. Ongelukkig het ek nie die tyd gehad om my aandag behoorlik daaraan te gee nie, maar ek sal die departement vra om daarna te kyk en dit aan my te gee. Ek sal my aandag dan daaraan gee. Indien nodig, sal ek dan &#x2019;n skriftelike antwoord aan die agb. lid daaroor gee.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Hillbrow het &#x2019;n paar oor-drewe stellings hier gemaak, maar ons ken hom so. Hy het ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;The position is chaotic&#x201D;. <span class="col_789-790" refersTo="page_0418"/>Meneer, ek weet nie waar die posisie nou so &#x201E;chaotic&#x201D; geword het nie. Behalwe vir die klein agterstand in Wit behuising, is die toestand ten opsigte van Kleurling-en Indi&#x00EB;rbehuising glad nie sleg nie. Dit is wel so dat ons &#x2019;n groot agterstand het ten opsigte van Swart behuising. Dit is &#x2019;n nuwe aspek. Swart behuising ressorteer vanaf die einde van 1979 onder hierdie departement.</p>

<p>Ons is mos nou al halfpad daarmee, maar die strategie en die prioriteite ten opsigte van Swart behuising word deur die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling bepaal. Hulle bepaal die prioriteite en die behoeftes. Dan voer ons die werk uit, en so ver as wat daar fondse van die Nasionale Behuisingskommissie moet kom, gee ons die fondse.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook gepraat van &#x2019;n &#x201E;lack of planning and a lack of funds&#x201D;. Ek dink ek het hom reeds &#x2019;n antwoord daarop gegee. Hy het ook gepraat van belastingtoegewings en huurbeheer. Oor huurbeheer het ek reeds gepraat. Dan het die agb. lid &#x2019;n aanbeveling gemaak ten opsigte van adviesburo&#x2019;s. Ek sal die departement op die aangeleentheid laat ingaan, en later uitsluitsel hieroor gee.</p>

<p>Wat betref die kwessie van subsidies, het die agb. lid vir Seepunt &#x2019;n hele klomp voorstelle gemaak. Ek kan onmoontlik in hierdie debat vanaand op almal antwoord. Ek het reeds in die algemeen oor &#x2019;n hele paar van hulle geantwoord. Baie van die voorstelle wat die agb. lede vir Seepunt en Hillbrow gemaak het, kom neer op subsidies, nie net ten opsigte van die individu en ten opsigte van die minder gegoedes nie, maar ook ten opsigte van die privaatsektor. Hierdie departement betaal reeds meer as R60 miljoen &#x2019;n jaar aan subsidies. Uit &#x2019;n bedrag van R300 miljoen wat ek vanjaar kry, gaan R60 miljoen reeds aan subsidies. Ons betaal dus subsidies. Daarbenewens wil ek agb. lede daarop wys dat die rente wat ons moet betaal op die kapitaal waarvan die agb. lid vir Bellville gepraat het, reeds R80 miljoen per jaar beloop. Nou vra die agb. lid dat ons nog meer aan subsidies moet betaal. Meneer, &#x2019;n 10&#x0025;-subsidie op R1 miljoen beteken alreeds R100 000 per jaar, en dit beteken &#x2019;n verdubbeling van die belegging binne ongeveer 8 jaar. Subsidies aan die privaatsektor is &#x2019;n bodemlose put; daar is geen terugvloeiing van kapitaal, soos in die geval van die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds nie. Die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds is &#x2019;n wentelfonds, en daarom is subsidies wat hier ingaan nie &#x2019;n bodemlose put nie. Hierdie wentelfonds, hierdie Nasionale Behuisingsfonds, is &#x2019;n trotse bate wat ons vandag het. Ons moet dit beskerm en bewaar, om te verhoed dat dit afgetakel word. Daardie fonds se bates beloop reeds R1,7 miljard, en ons kry nou reeds uit daardie wentelfonds R50 miljoen per jaar, wat ons in behuising kan terugploeg. As ek dit nou ges&#x00EA; het en my so sterk uitgelaat het, dan bedoel ek nie daarmee dat ek daarmee alle subsidies van die tafel probeer afvee nie; ons sal definitief na sekere dinge moet kyk. Ons sal insentiewe aan die privaatsektor en die bougenootskappe moet gee, anders sal hulle uit die aard van die saak nie belang stel in laekostebehuising nie. Niemand in hierdie w&#x00EA;reld wat besigheid doen en wat &#x2019;n profyt wil maak, gaan verliese ly nie. Ons sal hierdie mense &#x2019;n geleent-heid moet gee om &#x2019;n aandeel te neem. As ons dit egter doen op die basis van subsidies alleen, dan gaan ons &#x2019;n treurige pad op. Daarom, alhoewel ek nie subsidies summier van die tafel verwyder nie, is dit so dat ons versigtig moet optree wanneer ons hieraan dink.</p>

<p>Ek wil net iets aan die agb. lid vir Durban-Punt s&#x00EA;. Ek het reeds na sekere aspekte rakende huurbeheer verwys.</p>

<p>As regards the question of Marlborough Court, this was the subject of a Supreme Court decision, with which neither I nor the Government can interfere.</p>

<p>Dan moet ons maar sorg dat daar &#x2019;n antwoord kom. Ek sal daarvan &#x2019;n aantekening laat maak.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek ook verwys na Cato Manor. Die Indi&#x00EB;rs het kom smeek, net soos in die geval van Page View. Hulle het ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Gee dit vir ons terug; ons sal nooit weer vir julle iets vra nie. Gee dit net aan ons terug.&#x201D; Meneer, dit was die vieslikste slum in Suid-Afrika. <span class="col_791-792" refersTo="page_0419"/>Dit was nie die Indi&#x00EB;rs se grond nie. Hulle het dit ook nie bewoon nie. Hulle het net daar Swart mense laat woon. [Tussenwerpsels.] Uiteindelik het ons Cato Manor aan hulle teruggegee. Ek was toe Adjunk-Minister van Beplanning. Hulle het aan ons ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Gee net die plek aan ons. Julle hoef nie &#x2019;n sent hierin te steek nie. Ons sal dit met ons eie kapitaal ontwikkel, as &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;ge-haltewoonbuurt vir Indi&#x00EB;rs.&#x201D; Nou l&#x00EA; die plek, en nou gebeur daar niks. Hulle vra almal grond vir ontwikkeling en vir erwe, maar Cato Manor l&#x00EA; daar. Dit is na aan die stad, maar hulle doen niks nie. Nee, Meneer; hulle wil h&#x00EA; die Stadsraad van Durban moet dit vir hulle doen, en hulle wil h&#x00EA; die departement moet dit doen. Hulle sal lank wag vir my om daar geld vir ontwikkeling in te steek.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, op hierdie hoogtepunt, ná die Minister se antwoord, wil ek graag die onderwerp so &#x2019;n bietjie meer toespits op &#x2019;n plaaslike aangeleentheid, naamlik die gebiede Mayfair, Vrededorp en Page View, wat in my kiesafdeling gele&#x00EB; is. Voordat ek met hierdie betrokke gebiede handel, wil ek in die eerste plek aan die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister baie dankie s&#x00EA; vir die feit dat hulle onlangs, so twee maande gelede, daar in my w&#x00EA;reld kom besoek afl&#x00EA; het. Waar die Minister netnou vir die agb. lid vir Germiston belowe het dat hy daardie geweste ook sal gaan besoek, wil ek nou by voorbaat aan die agb. lid vir Germiston s&#x00EA; dat hy gewis kan weet dat die Minister sal kom, en dat hy daardie besoek die moeite werd sal maak. Dit was ons ervaring gewees dat die Minister en die Adjunk-minister op &#x2019;n baie opregte wyse hulle belangstelling in die plaaslike probleme van die gemeenskap daar kom toon het. Hulle het letterlik in die strate kom loop en by mense aangeklop om op die hoogte te kom van die probleme wat ons in daardie spesifieke gebied ervaar. Ek wil daarvoor baie dankie s&#x00EA;, en die agb. Minister bedank vir daardie demonstrasie van menslikheid en van werklike belangstelling wat daardeur van hom en die agb. Adjunk-minister uitgegaan het. Dit het uiteraard, spesifiek met betrekking tot ons probleme in Vrededorp, reeds tot bepaalde oplossings gely. Die feit dat daar in die afgelope tyd &#x2019;n redelike bespoediging van die bouprogram in daardie gebied was en die feit dat die Gemeenskapsontwikkelingsraad volgende jaar voortgaan met &#x2019;n verdere 50 huise in daardie gebied, is alles &#x2019;n verligting van ons behoefte om die gebied van Vrededorp heropgebou en gerestoureer te kry, om sodoende die ou inwoners van Vrededorp as &#x2019;t ware weer daar gevestig te kry. Ek s&#x00EA; dus, ook namens die gemeenskappe daar plaaslik, baie dankie vir die besoek wat daar gebring is en die belangstelling wat die Minister en die Adjunk-minister in daardie gebied getoon het.</p>

<p>Mag ek net ten opsigte van Vrededorp die enkele versoek rig dat dit miskien goed sou wees as daar vorentoe weer gekyk word na die rehabilitering van die bestaande wonings in di&#x00E9; gebied. Ek weet die departement het al in die verlede aandag gegee aan hierdie probleem, maar ek dink dit is nodig dat daar weer in hierdie verband &#x2019;n poging aangewend sal word. Ons sal van die plaaslike gemeenskap se kant ook &#x2019;n poging aanwend om met die departement saam te werk om die gemeenskap self te kry om aan &#x2019;n rehabi-litasiepoging mee te doen. Dan is dit ook nodig dat ons weer eens &#x2019;n beroep op die private sektor daar sal doen om die le&#x00EB; standplase wat daar is, te help ontwikkel, sodat ons vestiging op &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB; vlak in die Vrededorp-gebied kan kry.</p>

<p>Ten opsigte van die Mayfair-gebied, wat ook in my kiesafdeling gele&#x00EB; is, wil ek graag die volgende opmerkings maak: Ons het oor &#x2019;n lang tydperk bepaalde probleme in die Mayfair-gebied ervaar, wat hoofsaaklik saamhang met die onwettige bewoning deur Indi&#x00EB;rs van die Blanke woongebied van Mayfair. Hierdie probleemhet veral oor die laaste jaar ge-eskaleer, in so &#x2019;n mate dat dit &#x2019;n gespanne atmosfeer in die gemeenskap daar geskep het. Ons het die Minister op hoogte gehou van die probleemdaar, en ek dink hy is net so vertroud daarmee as wat ek is, indien nie beter nie. Hierdie gespanne atmosfeer was beslis nie heilsaam vir die plaaslike Blanke gemeenskap daar nie, en ek dink dit was ook nie heilsaam vir die Indi&#x00EB;r-gemeenskap nie. Onder die Blankes het dit onsekerheid laat ontstaan, en as gevolg van die onsekerheid het sommige mense begin om kragdadig op te tree, en te pleit vir kragdadige optrede, om die Indi&#x00EB;rs daar uitgesit te kry. Ander is vanwe&#x00EB; die onsekerheid huiwerig om, byvoorbeeld, restourasiewerk aan <span class="col_793-794" refersTo="page_0420"/>hulle eie eiendomme te verrig, want hulle s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Dit help nie dat ons nou restoureer nie; dalk word die eiendomme oor &#x2019;n tyd ons in elk geval ontneem.&#x201D; &#x2019;n Derde groep het in elk geval reeds die gebied verlaat en elders &#x2019;n heenkome gaan soek, omdat daardie onsekerheid daar bestaan. Dit het noodwendig &#x2019;n mate van verval, of agteruitgang, vir die plaaslike gemeenskap beteken, in terme van die skool, die kerke, en dies meer.</p>

<p>Meneer, dit het op die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap ook &#x2019;n bepaalde effek gehad. Daar is by die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap &#x2019;n behoefte aan &#x2019;n alternatiewe woonbuurt vir Lenasia. Hulle versprei huileself op die oomblik op &#x2019;n redelike basis ook in ander woonbuurte in die stad, by wyse van hierdie onwettige bewoning. Dit lok natuurlik weerstand uit by die Blanke gemeenskap, wat nie heilsaam is vir goeie verhoudinge tussen die Blanke en Indi&#x00EB;rge-meenskappe in die geheel in Johannesburg nie.</p>

<p>Nadat ek vir &#x2019;n tydperk van min of meer 2 jaar intensief met hierdie problemsaamge-leef het en gekyk het na alle hoeke en kante daarvan, meen ek dat daar uit die aard van die saak verskillende oplossings is wat ons daarvoor kan kry. Hier sluit ek my aan by ander gedagtes wat vroe&#x00EB;r vanmiddag in hierdie Komitee uitgespreek is. Maar, Meneer, ek dink die mees standhoudende oplossing wat ons vir hierdie probleemvan die Indi&#x00EB;rs in Johannesburg kan kry, is &#x2019;n Indi&#x00EB;rwoonbuurt in Johannesburg. Ek dink die daarstelling daarvan kan inderdaad vir ons die mees standhoudende oplossing verseker, vir byde die Blanke gemeenskap en die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap, want dit kan lei tot &#x2019;n vreedsame oplossing. Meneer, ek het die rekords en ek kan getuig daarvan; ons Blanke gemeenskap streef inderdaad net soveel na &#x2019;n vreedsame oplossing vir hierdie probleem. Hulle soek ook nie venyn en haat wat dit betref nie. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, meen ek dat die beste en mees standhoudende oplossing hiervoor juis langs hierdie weg l&#x00EA;, en om daar-deur ook &#x2019;n billike toepassing van die Groepsgebiedewet te kry&#x2014;waarop ek net-nou sal terugkom.</p>

<p>In hierdie situasie is daar iets wat ek graag ten aanhore van die Opposisie wil s&#x00EA;. In die situasie wat ons daar in Mayfair ervaar, het ons die beste bewys dat die beleid van die Nasionale Party met betrekking tot die ver-sekering van afsonderlike woongebiede vir verskillende gemeenskappe in Suid-Afrika korrek is. Ons het daar die beste bewys van die potensiaal vir konflik wat daar kan bestaan, en ek daag enige lid van die Opposisie uit om saam met my in daardie gemeenskap te gaan rondbeweeg. Ek dink hierdie maat-re&#x00EB;l van afsonderlike woongebiede is vir ons &#x2019;n noodsaaklike maatre&#x00EB;l om konflik te voorkom op Suid-Afrika se pad vorentoe met betrekking tot woongebiede.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is betekenisvol om daarop te let&#x2014;en ek s&#x00EA; dit weer ten aanhore van die Opposisie&#x2014;dat die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap op sigself geen begeerte het om in Blanke gebied in te trek nie. Dat dit wel op hierdie oomblik gebeur, is in groot mate ongelukkig, meen ek, alhoewel daar natuurlik die moeilikheidmakers is. Die probleemdaar spruit basies uit die behoefte aan &#x2019;n altema-tiewe woonbuurt vir Lenasia, en dit word ongelukkig uitgebuit, soos die agb. lid vir Langlaagte vroe&#x00EB;r uitgewys het.</p>

<p>Daar is werklik nie &#x2019;n substansi&#x00EB;le deel van die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap wat &#x2019;n behoefte daaraan het om huileself in Blanke gebied te gaan tuismaak nie. Sover my kennis strek, is daar, in die getuienis wat voor die Presi-dentsraad afgel&#x00EA; is met betrekking tot Page View, geen getuienis waarin daardie versoek aan die Presidentsraad vervat is nie. Ook in my raadpleging met die verteenwoordigers van daardie Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap, het ek nog nooit daardie behoefte uitgespreek gekry nie. Dit kan ek met groot sekerheid s&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek dink die oplossing van &#x2019;n Indi&#x00EB;rwoonbuurt kan die volgende verseker en die volgende voordele inhou: Dit kan eerstens &#x2019;n billike toepassing van die Groepsgebiedewet verseker. Ek dink dit was nooit die bedoeling nie, en dit is seker ook nie die bedoeling van die Groepsgebiedewet nie, om teen enige groep te diskrimineer nie, maar ek dink hierdie oplossing kan &#x2019;n vreedsame naasbestaan van ons verskillende gemeenskappe in daardie gebied verseker. Daar is ander voorbeelde wat aangehaal kan word om hierdie punt te substansieer. Die agb. Minister het netnou verwys na Durban. Ek gee toe dat sekere probleme daar bestaan, maar selfs in Pretoria is daar &#x2019;n Indi&#x00EB;r-buurt in die stad. So het Johannesburg ook byvoorbeeld verskillende Kleurlingbuurte. Soos ek s&#x00EA;, dit kan &#x2019;n billike toepassing van die Groepsgebiedewet verseker, om die bepaalde probleemwat ons daar het, op te <span class="col_795-796" refersTo="page_0421"/>los. Dit is inderdaad die enigste en mees standhoudende oplossing wat ons daar kan verkry. In die tweede plek het dit die voordeel dat dit oor die lang termyn &#x2019;n aanvaar-baarheid vir die toepassing van die Groeps-gebiedewet kan verseker, om sodoende te verseker dat hierdie noodsaaklike ordenings-maatre&#x00EB;l in die Suid-Afrika van die toekoms staande kan bly, om daardeur &#x2019;n billike en vreedsame naasbestaan vir gemeenskappe naas mekaar te vind.</p>

<p>Meneer, ek wil dan graag ten besluite vra of die Minister, wanneer hy weer tot die debat toetree, bereid sal wees om in hierdie stadium vir ons duidelik uit te spel of May-fair &#x2019;n Blanke groepsgebied gaan bly. Ek dink dit is belangrik dat ons daardie aanduiding kry. Tweedens wil ons graag weet wat sy houding is ten opsigte van die moont-likheid van &#x2019;n Indi&#x00EB;rgroepsgebied vir Johannesburg of omstreke. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. G. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that the hon. the Minister has a major probleem on his hands. It is a probleem which he has inherited. I believe that it is a probleem of omission more than anything else. I believe, however, that he uses a language and a terminology that the common man understands. He also shows a basic knowledge of his subject, and I hope this augurs well for the people of South Africa, because what I would like is to see him putting that knowledge into effect where it is needed, namely in the provision of housing for those who need it.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to turn for a moment to the hon. the Deputy Minister, if I may. He referred to the question of the family looking after the aged. I should like to remind him, in these days of the high cost of living and spiralling inflation, that there was a time when families used to look after the aged. Today, however, they cannot. There was also a time when the old-age pension was supplementary to people&#x2019;s living costs. Today it is no longer supplementary; it is the only money they have to live on. This is a probleem that we face today.</p>

<p>I also welcome the Minister&#x2019;s statement, that one should aim at keeping the aged in their own homes for as long as possible. This is a concept which we support, but which we believe needs much more attention. I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us more definitive ideas of what he has in mind in this respect.</p>

<p>Sir, I am going to deal with a parochial probleem, if I may. The hon. the Minister has said that that is what we are here for, to deal with our parochial problems. I refer specifically to the housing situation at Marburg and Merlewould. I am referring, of course, to the areas that the department is now developing. In this regard I should like to say that I have been associated with this since its very inception, through the local authorities. Notwithstanding the fact that these areas are outside the jurisdiction of the Port Shep-stone borough council we in Port Shepstone have bent over backwards to allow the department to go ahead with this planning. We have become involved in the running of a sewerage scheme, we have become involved in taking part of that sewerage scheme over. Therefore, I believe we have done everything that we possibly could to assist the department to go ahead with this.</p>

<p>I believe tenders will be called for later this year in respect of the Indian housing. In this regard I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to clarify the position as far as Merlewould is concerned. I have been informed that Merlewould would only be sold for development and then again I have been informed that it would be sold for development but that the department was also going to erect houses there. I should like to know what exactly the position is, whether it will be the one or the other or whether it will be both.</p>

<p>Tenders have not been able to be called for because of certain delays. I wish to emphasize that the delays have not been on the side of the department once the green light was given. I believe the delay is due to finance difficulties and also the fault of the contractor. I will refer to the contractor at a later stage. However, this does not alter the position as far as the Coloureds are concerned at this moment in time. When the Transkei became independent there was a certain influx of Coloureds into our area because of the availability of work. However, the probleem was that there was no Coloured area for them to settle in and the only alternative open to them was to move into the Indian area which at that time was already overcrowded. Accommodation was at a premium. Exorbitant rentals are being <span class="col_797-798" refersTo="page_0422"/>charged for accommodation that is on a par with or in some cases below that which one would expect in a slum area. This is not an ideal situation for these two groups to live together under these circumstances. Certain of the Coloureds have been given notice to vacate the premises they occupy, however, there is just no other accommodation available to them. This is leading to the build-up of tension between the two groups. This is starting to escalate. What is disturbing is the distinct possibility of open confrontation and possibly violence. Quite a few of the Coloureds living in the area are building contractors. They are in a position to build their own homes if the land is available. Here I want to refer back to what I said earlier when I said that I believed that the delay was partly the fault of the contractor. It appears that a contractor got the contract for services for the first phase. He has now also got the contract for the second phase. Tenders were called for and he tendered the best price. However, on the first phase he was running plus/minus nine months behind schedule. I hope that if the hon. the Minister goes ahead with the second phase, the department will be a bit more vigilant on that contractor&#x2019;s performance, and, if necessary, invoke the penalty clause which, I believe, was not done in respect of the first phase. This is one of the main problems facing the department right now.</p>

<p>To get back to the Coloured area at Merlewould, the services are all but complete, but the land has not been sold yet because it has not been proclaimed. I believe that the proclaiming of the land will take six to nine months. I think that is the normal period. If tenders are to be called for towards the end of this year, or early next year, it will be another six or nine months before accommodation will be available.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. G. THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am very pleased to hear that. This is definitely causing frustration because the Coloureds are now building homes for the White community, very nice homes, yet they are precluded from going ahead and building for themselves. I believe we should be a little more patient. It is difficult to put yourself in the position of the Coloured. He does not understand the word patience, because the land is there and the services are there and he wants to get going. Because of the situation that has arisen and because of the shortage of housing, exorbitant rentals are being charged, and I believe that a temporary solution must be sought. I believe the position can be solved at Fynn&#x2019;s Location which is on the outskirts of Port Shepstone.</p>

<p>I should just like to deal briefly with the history of Fynn&#x2019;s Location. Queen Victoria gave a certain Mr. Fynn a piece of land for services rendered. Mr. Fynn and his descendants have established themselves in that area and it is commonly referred to as Fynn&#x2019;s Location. Some of the houses built there are of a fairly high standard, and some of them are not all that good. The Fynn family is agreeable to further developments taking place there. The position is that that piece of land falls under the jurisdiction of the hon. the Minister and is regulated by the Development and Services Board. I believe that permission has been granted for Coloureds to build there and they are prepared to build according to the standards set by the Development and Services Board. I would respectfully suggest that the hon. the Minister looks into this position and allows accommodation to be built there on a <i>pro tem</i> basis according to standards that will be acceptable to the Development and Services Board.</p>

<p>In closing I should like to say that I am grateful to the hon. the Minister and the Director for their visit to Ifafa Beach. I believe this is much appreciated by the people in that area, notwithstanding the fact that they never saw the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, <span class="col_799-800" refersTo="page_0423"/>die agb. lid vir Suidkus wil vir my voorkom &#x2019;n man te wees wat sy kiesafdeling op &#x2019;n besondere wyse in hierdie Raad gaan verteenwoordig. Na aanleiding van sy toespraak glo ek gaan daar heelwat dingetjies in sy kiesafdeling plaasvind.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil my in die eerste instansie wend tot die agb. Minister en sy departement. Ek wil die agb. Minister en sy amptenare gelukwens met hierdie pragtige rasionalisering wat hulle in hulle departement teweeggebring het. Dit was vir my opvallend dat die agb. Minister gedurigdeur aan die spits van daardie span was wat hierdie pragtige werk in daardie departement gedoen het.</p>

<p>Met die uitbreiding van Reigerpark is die rol wat die agb. Minister daar speel om samewerking tussen die verskillende groepe te bewerkstellig dan ook sekerlik die grootste enkele rede waarom daar op hierdie oomblik so fluks met die hele projek gevorgeleder word. Daarvoor wil ek dan ook graag namens my hele kiesafdeling aan die agb. Minister dankie s&#x00EA;. Om die uitbreiding van hierdie Kleurlingdorp deur te voer, sal die agb. Minister moontlik die hulp van sy kollega, die agb. Minister van Binnelandse Aangeleenthede, moet inroep, want ek glo hy gaan probleme h&#x00EA; met die geraassone van Jan Smutslughawe waarbinne so te s&#x00EA; die hele Reigerpark l&#x00EA;. Ek wil dan ook vir die agb. Minister s&#x00EA; dat hy in hierdie verband reeds die steun het van al die Kleurlingleiers in Reigerpark sowel as van die Blankes van Boksburg. Ons is bewus van die nadelige uitwerking van vliegtuiggeraasbesoedeling, maar ons is oortuig daarvan dat hierdie grense hersien kan word, in die lig van die vordering wat in lugvaarttegnologie gemaak is, en ook teen die agtergrond van die geraassone by D. F. Malanlughawe en die ligging van Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain in vergelyking met die geraassone van Jan Smutslughawe en die ligging van Reigerpark. Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain l&#x00EA; sowat drie kilometer suid vanaf D. F. Malanlughawe en is geheel en al buite die geraassone, teenoor Reigerpark wat tussen sewe en agt kilometer vanaf Jan Smutslughawe gele&#x00EB; is en geheel en al binne daardie geraassone val.</p>

<p>Ek is &#x2019;n leek op die gebied van lugvaart, maar ek wil graag &#x2019;n gedagte in die agb. Minister se midde laat. Wanneer hierdie geraassone heroorweeg word, behoort die moontlikheid van landing vanuit die noorde op Jan Smutslughawe op die nuwe aanloop-baan ondersoek te word omdat daar &#x2019;n gedagteskool is dat, met die kragtige motore van die moderne vliegtuig dit moontlik is om sonder probleme wind-af te land. So &#x2019;n oplossing sal vir Boksburg en vir Reigerpark groot voordele inhou. Die moontlikheid behoort myns insiens ondersoek te word.</p>

<p>Ek wil in hierdie stadium vir die agb. Minister dankie s&#x00EA; dat ons hierdie finale fase van die moontlike uitbreidingsplan van Reigerpark bereik het. Dit het baie jare geduur om sover te kom. Uiteindelik, glo ek, behoort ons bymekaar te kan bring dit wat bymekaar hoort, want daar is nog baie Kleurling-Moslems wat in Actonville gehuisves word wat sekerlik ook nou oorge-skuif kan word. Sou ons daarin slaag om Reigerpark se grense uit te brei, kan ons hulle dalk ook in Reigerpark huisves.</p>

<p>In my kiesafdeling het die HNP die skinderstorie versprei dat hierdie moontlike uitbreiding van Reigerpark se grense verswyg is tot na die verkiesing van 29 April. Daarom wil ek dit graag hier op rekord plaas dat ons reeds hierdie agb. Minister tesame met sy voorganger in Boksburg op besoek gehad het in 1979 en dat hierdie saak verlede jaar deur myself in die Volksraad geopper is. Dit is in die <i>Hansard</i> opgeneem in kolom 6286. Daarom verwerp ek sulke skinderstories van die HNP as maar net nog een van daardie onwaarhede wat hom by die stembus gepootjie het. Dit was egter interessant om te sien hoe hierdie aksie om Reigerpark se grense uitgebrei te kry beide die PFP en die HNP in Boksburg ontmasker het vir wat hulle is. Onmiddellik nadat die advertensie geplaas is dat die departement &#x2019;n vergrote Reigerpark gaan oorweeg, het die HNP &#x2019;n protesvergadering in Boksburg bel&#x00EA; onder die wekroep &#x201E;Hou Boksburg Blank&#x201D;. Dit het die PFP in Boksburg so met weersin vervul dat hulle dit oorweeg het om &#x2019;n hofbevel te verkry om die vergadering te verbied. Verheel u, Meneer, hierdie groot kampveggeleters vir die vryheid van spraak probeer die HNP se mond snoer wanneer hulle &#x2019;n protesvergadering in Boksburg re&#x00EB;l. &#x2019;n Mens wonder wat sal gebeur as iemand die PFP se Katedraalvergaderings hier in die Kaap sou probeer verhoed het. Snaaks genoeg, daarna kom tree hulle in hierdie Komitee op as pleitbesorgers vir die HNP. [Tussenwerpgeleseis.] <span class="col_801-802" refersTo="page_0424"/>Die eerste advertensie oor die voorgestelde uitbreiding van Reigerpark het ook nie die Nasionale Party van Boksburg se goedkeuring weggedra nie. Daarom het ons dit dadelik onder die agb. Minister se aandag gebring. Die advertensie is toe gewysig. Maar dit was verbasend hoe daardie eerste advertensie die ondersteuners van Boksburg se PFP ontstel het. Hulle was van die mense wat die heftigste beswaar gemaak het teen die moontlikheid dat slegs &#x2019;n spoorlyn skeiding tussen hulle en die Kleurlinge sou bring. Baie van hulle het dan ook daardie petisie onderteken wat by die departement ingedien moes word.</p>

<p>Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat die privaat-sektor ook sy deel sal bydra in die ontwikkeling van hierdie Kleurlingdorp. Daarom wil ek die hoop uitspreek dat die myn sal afsien van sy beleid om nie Kleurlinge in diens te neem nie, veral gesien in die lig daarvan dat die reduksiewerke van daardie spesifieke myn reg in die hart van Reigerpark gelee is. Ek kan so &#x2019;n beleid nie aanvaar nie, en ek dink die mynwese van Suid-Afrika moet hierdie saak ondersoek. Hulle het net so &#x2019;n rol te speel in die bou van gemeenskappe as die staat. Daarom kan ek dit nie aanvaar dat geen Kleurling tans op daardie myn werk-saam is nie. Ons het Kleurlinge daar wat goeie messelaars is, wat goeie verwers is, wat goeie skrynwerkers is. Daar is so baie dinge waarvoor daardie mense in diens geneem kan word, veral in hulle eie dorpsgebied. Daarom wil ek &#x2019;n beroep op die mynwese doen dat hulle sal ag gee aan hierdie gemeenskap wat die departement daar probeer vestig.</p>

<p>Voordat ek afsluit, is daar &#x2019;n ander saak wat ek graag onder die agb. Adjunk-minister se aandag wil bring. Dit is &#x2019;n saak wat ek al vantevore in die Volksraad bepleit het, maar ek glo die probleme wat ons met man-nekragtekort het, het veroorsaak dat hierdie saak ietwat agterwe&#x00EB; gelaat is. Ek wil graag versoek dat hierdie departement breedvoerig ondersoek instel na die aantal le&#x00EB; Staatserwe wat deur die jare in ons dorpe onbenut bly l&#x00EA; het. Sulke erwe in Boksburg is onder alle Staatsdepartemente gesirkuleer wat dit moontlik kon benut, daarna is die erwe aan die Stadsraad aangebied of per openbare veiling verkoop. Dit het ons dorp van &#x2019;n geweldige las verlos en opnuut ontwikkeling gestimuleer in gebiede wat geneig het om ekonomies agteruit te gaan. Dit het tot dusver &#x2019;n addisionele inkomste van sowat R15 000 per jaar aan die stadsraad voorsien in die vorm van eiendomsbelasting asook die beter benutting van al sy dienste. Dit was &#x2019;n omvangryke taak wat nie sonder die hulp van die stadsraad verrig kon word nie. Ons sit egter nog met &#x2019;n groot aantal provinsiale erwe en eiendomme wat nie benut word nie. Gesien in die lig van die voordeel wat die benutting van hierdie erwe vir Boksburg in-hou, wil ek aan die hand doen dat die agb. Minister die saak verder neem en dat hy die provinsiale owerhede versoek om te kyk of hulle nie nog eiendomme wat hulle in baie dorpe en stede besit, kan benut nie. Omdat die taak te omvangryk vir hierdie departement is, moet die dorps-en stadsrade opdrag gegee word om self &#x2019;n lys van sulke eiendomme op te stel en aan hierdie departement en die betrokke provinsiale owerhede voor te l&#x00EA;. Ek glo dat as al die eiendomme wat so onbenut in ons land l&#x00EA;, van die hand gesit word, die agb. Minister se departement en die provinsiale owerhede &#x2019;n aardige bedrag sal in wat handig te pas sal kom. &#x2019;n Oppervlakkige ondersoek wat ek self in &#x2019;n naburige Oosrandse dorp gedoen het, het die volgende aan die lig gebring. Daardie dorp sit met 400 Staatserwe waarvan 280 nog onbenut is. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. MAR&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, vergun my om met my eerste optrede in die Parlement dank en waardering namens myself en ook namens my kiesers aan my voorganger te betuig. Ek glo ek kan sonder vrees van te&#x00EB;spraak s&#x00EA; dat hy deur sy kiesers en kollegas gesien is as &#x2019;n baie toegewyde en hardwerkende persoon. Ek wil hom dan ook die beste toewens in die baie belangrike taak wat hy nou verrig as voorsitter van die Be-planningskomitee van die Presidentsraad.</p>

<p>Wanneer ook al die waarde bepaal moet word van eiendomme wat deur die Staat van &#x2019;n individu verkry moet word, het ons met &#x2019;n baie ernstige saak te doen. Dit is ingewikkelder as ander eiendomstransaksies aangesien die markmeganisme nie intree nie en die transaksie dus nie daaraan getoets kan word nie. Dit is &#x2019;n belangrike saak, want daar moet &#x2019;n billike balans tussen die regte van die individu en die regte van die Staat gehandhaaf word. Vir die individu gaan dit gepaard met sosiale ontwrigting. Sentimentele <span class="col_803-804" refersTo="page_0425"/>waarde waarop daar nie maklik &#x2019;n kom-mersi&#x00EB;le waarde geplaas kan word nie, speel ook &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol. Dat die Staat ten volle bewus is van hierdie twee faktore, naamlik ontwrigting en sentimentele waarde, word bewys deur die bepalings van artikel 12 van die Onteieningswet wat voorsiening maak vir <i>solatium</i> van 10&#x0025; van die waarde van die betrokke eiendom tot &#x2019;n maksimum van R10 000. Ek kan miskien net terloops noem dat dit moontlik &#x2019;n gebrek kan wees in die onteieningsprosedure dat hierdie <i>solatium</i> slegs betaal word waar eiendomsreg verkry word en nie waar &#x2019;n beperkte reg verkry word nie soos byvoorbeeld in die geval van &#x2019;n reg van vruggebruik, wat in baie gevalle byna net so sterk as eiendomsreg kan wees, of &#x2019;n ongeregistreerde reg soos byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n huurkontrak wat ook baie in-grypend kan wees. &#x2019;n Verdere probleemis dat die eienaar dit moeilik vind om objektief te wees oor die waarde van sy eiendom. &#x2019;n Mens kan baiemaal &#x2019;n boer net so min oortuig dat sy plaas nie die beste in die omge-wing is nie as wat jy sekere van my kollegas kan oortuig dat daar nog ander kiesafdelings behalwe hulle eie is wat ook mooi is nie. Hierin is die rol van die waardeerder dus beslissend. Alhoewel ons in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n hoogs lewenskragtige en ontwikkelde eien-domsbedryf het, het daar tog nog nie &#x2019;n sterk eiendomsprofessie ontwikkel nie. Benewens waardeerders aangestel ingevolge die Boedelwet, is daar maar 612 waardeerders wat lede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Instituut vir Waardeerders is. Verenigings soos Veesa lewer &#x2019;n uitstekende diens aan sy lede, maar hulle bly ingestel op &#x2019;n diens slegs aan hulle lede. Die individu is nog steeds aangewese op die private waardeerder as sy raadgewer.</p>

<p>Litigasie is nie die antwoord nie. Dit is spanningsvol, tydsaam en baie duur, veral gemeet aan tydsverlies en aan emosionele energieverspilling. As &#x2019;n mens kyk na die verslag van die departement waarna die agb. lid vir Valsbaai ook verwys het toe hy ges&#x00EA; het dat die departement sekere waardeerders nie weer moet aanstel nie, en ons kyk na die gevalle wat deur die hof besleg is&#x2014;ek verwys hier na die Theewaterskloof-gevalle&#x2014;vind jy dat die Staat wel in &#x2019;n geringe mate te hoog met sy aanbiedinge was. As &#x2019;n mens egter kyk na die bedrae wat die betrokke eienaars vir hulle eiendomme wou h&#x00EA;, vind jy dat daar gevalle was waar eienaars sover as 180&#x0025;, 232&#x0025;, 284&#x0025; tot 511&#x0025; uit die kol uit was. As die agb. lid vir Valsbaai dus die Staat se waardeerders kritiseer, hoeveel te meer moet &#x2019;n mens nie die waardeerders kritiseer wat die eienaars in daardie gevalle geadviseer het nie? Die eienaars het &#x00F2;f verkeerde advies gekry &#x00F2;f hulle wou nie na hulle eie raadgewers luister nie. As &#x2019;n mens kyk na die gevalle waar daar &#x2019;n ooreenkoms bereik is, is &#x2019;n mens be&#x00EF;ndruk met die groot aantal gevalle waar die Staat in die kol was terwyl die betrokke eienaars se eis die uiteindelike bedrag met tot 650&#x0025; oorskry het. Die aanpassing van die Staat se aanbod in hierdie gevalle was persentasie-gewys baie gering.</p>

<p>Soos ek reeds ges&#x00EA; het, kan die rede hiervoor wees die eensydige siening van die eienaar, maar &#x2019;n faktor wat ook &#x2019;n rol speel is dat die waardebepaling &#x2019;n uiters ingewikkelde berekening is. Normaalweg moet die waardeerder &#x2019;n deeglike kennis dra van die wetsbepalings, omgewingsfaktore en ekono-miese faktore. Hierdie faktore kan almal inwerk op die bepaling van die waarde van die eiendom. Dan moet hy ook nog sy indruk-ke&#x2014;d.w.s. as ons aanvaar dat hy van die regte veronderstellings uitgegaan het&#x2014;korrek interpreteer.</p>

<p>We can say that the market value of real estate reflects, and is affected by, the interplay of basic forces that motivate the activities of human beings. These forces which produce the variables in real estate market values may be, or shall I say, are often seen very differently by different valuators, depending on background, past experience, and often result in large differences in the end results. In South Africa most authorities refuse during the negotiation stage to disclose any information on how its offer of compensation has been arrived at. Such an attitude impedes any settlement negotiations and often leads to litigation, which as I have shown, is not satisfactory. I have looked at corresponding legislation of other countries and I have found that in Canada in terms of the Ontario Expropriation Act an appraisers&#x2019; report on which the offer is based must be served with the offer of compensation. The Act also provides for a board of negotiation &#x201C;to proceed in a summary and informal manner to negotiate the settlement of <span class="col_805-806" refersTo="page_0426"/>compensation&#x201D;, a procedure which, although the board has no power to make a binding decision, has resulted in practice in nearly all matters being settled out of court. I do not maintain that our authorities are uncooperative or obstructive. My experience is just the opposite. However, for the reasons I have mentioned, owners are often unreasonable and a forum for discussion can do no harm and will in fact save a lot of time and costs on both sides. It is the normal practice of the courts to insist that experts on both sides meet and in the minutes of such meeting they have to record their points of agreement and points of disagreement. That, of course, saves time because no evidence will be led on their points of agreement. May I suggest that if these meetings can be held before litigation starts it may result in a lot of these matters being settled not only out of court but in fact before litigation is instituted.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. K. MOORCROFT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasant task to congratulate the hon. member for Nelspruit on his maiden speech. He chose an interesting and important topic, researched it well and spoke with great authority on it. It remains for me to wish him well in his parliamentary career.</p>

<p>This department is heavily involved in the financing of Black housing and it is thus also involved in attempting to avert a crisis of alarming proportions in Black housing. I use the word &#x201C;crisis&#x201D; advisedly. This situation has arisen largely as a result of three factors. The first of these is, of course, the Black population explosion; the second one is the irreversable phenomenon of urbanization; and the third one is the neglect of this field by previous administrations. These three factors have placed a tremendous burden on the present administration. Relieving this burden will be a task worthy of one of the labours of Hercules.</p>

<p>Let us consider the magnitude of this task. According to Profs. Van Rensburg and Sadie the Black population in South Africa is growing at an average of 3&#x0025; annually. That is one of the highest rates in Africa. At the same time urbanization is taking place so rapidly that the Black urban populations will have increased from 6 million to 28 million by the turn of the century. This will mean that we shall need to provide an extra 3,4 million housing units in the next 19 years. Most of us here this evening will still be around in 19 years time, I hope.</p>

<p>Speak for yourself.</p>

<speech by="#moorcroft">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. K. MOORCROFT</person>:</from>

<p>I mean on this planet, not in this House. If we put the cost of these houses at R8 000 each, it will require an amount of R27 000 million to build those houses. At the same time there is an estimated housing shortage of some 430 000 units. The cost of eliminating this particular backlog will be some R200 million. Therefore, we are talking about a total requirement of something like R30 000 million, taken at current cost. However, if one takes into account the inflation rate in the building industry which is currently running at about 2&#x0025; per month, then the implications become mind-boggling. Let us reduce it to meaningful figures. According to the chairman of the South African Housing Committee, Mr. Piet Moolman, a house costing R39 000 to build today will cost no less than R373 622 in the year 2000. This is an almost ten-fold increase. What the budget will look like at the turn of the century, I leave to hon. members&#x2019; imagination. The real significance of inflation becomes apparent when one looks at the figure appropriated for housing this year by this department. This figure is R256 million. If we compare this to last year&#x2019;s figure which was R231 750 000 and if we take the current inflation rate in the building industry into account which is 2&#x0025; per month and, therefore, 24&#x0025; per year, but which I will reduce to 20&#x0025; per year for the purpose of my argument, we find that in relative terms this department now has some R46 million less to spend on housing during this financial year than it had last year. As someone coming from the Eastern Cape, my interests are focused to a large extent on that area and on my constituency. In the Port Elizabeth townships of the Eastern Cape the backlog in housing is so serious that of an estimated population of 280 000 people some 98 000 are living in self-built shacks under slum conditions. In the Soweto/ Veeplaas township, where some of the worst conditions exist&#x2014;this township stretches over 115 hectares&#x2014;there is a total estimated population of 66 000 people, which gives a population of 574 people per hectare. This is <span class="col_807-808" refersTo="page_0427"/>six times higher than the official acceptable standard. These 66 000 people draw water from 36 taps. This means that there is one tap for every 360 families, or one tap for every 1 833 people. The absolute minimum standard as laid down by the Department of Health, Welfare and Pensions is one tap for 20 families. This is the probleem we are facing. What about the rest of the Port Elizabeth area? Unless the present rate of construction of 900 houses a year is to be increased&#x2014;the backlog of housing in 14 000 units&#x2014;the backlog will increase by 300 units per year. In order to wipe out this backlog in 11 years, the construction rate will have to be increased by 278&#x0025; to 2 500 units per year. At current cost this would mean R20 million per annum for Port Elizabeth alone. These are frightening figures.</p>

<p>What is the position in the rest of the Eastern Cape? Let us consider just one factor, overcrowding. For low-rise, high-density housing the figure of 100 people per hectare is considered acceptable, but in the 34 worst townships 21 have over 200 people, nine have over 300 people and four have over 400 people. To upgrade these townships will require an additional R540 million immediately. To provide extra housing to eliminate the overcrowding will mean another R200 million and to maintain these standards will mean R28 million a year. The 74 townships which are administered by the Eastern Province Administration Board have, with few exceptions, been described by their technical officer as being little better than disaster areas. One-third of the existing houses in those townships have been classified, and I am going to quote, &#x201C;having damages or defects very serious and of such a nature that one small step further will lead to total collapse or render the house uninhabitable.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As member for Albany I want to mention Grahamstown specifically. With a population of some 45 000 there is a 5 000 house backlog. The reason for this is that virtually no houses have been built over the last ten years. There are only 3 000 houses in fair condition and, although 240 houses are being built at the moment, this is totally inadequate. There is going to be a need for something like 15 000 houses by the turn of the century. If these figures tell us anything, then it is that the stubborn insistence on conventional building standards, which up to now has been the policy of this department, will have to go. There appears to be a healthy realization at last that we will have to resort to unconventional methods if the shortfall is to be made up, and future requirements met. This is the first absolute necessity. The second absolute necessity will be to accept the indispensable role which private enterprise is going to have to play in assisting with the financing of housing. Thirdly, the potential of so-called sweatequity, or the necessity of would-be homeowners to provide their own labour in lieu of capital, will have to be exploited. Fourthly, small contractors, preferably but not necessarily Black, will need to be encouraged and fifthly, tax incentives will of necessity have to be provided in order to encourage big corporations to involve themselves to a greater extent than at present. Clearly there will have to be a re-alignment of responsibility as regards the provision of Black housing. If the private sector&#x2014;and this includes the individual home-owner as well as the employers&#x2014;can become heavily involved, then the State can be reasonably expected to accept responsibility for the balance.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER VAN GRONDSAKE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Albanie het projeksies gemaak wat baie pessimisties is, en ek is bevrees dat as hy verder sou gaan, ons naderhand &#x2019;n situasie sou bereik dat ons geen vooruitsigte meer sou h&#x00EA; vir behuising nie. Ek moet s&#x00EA; ons is baie bewus van die behuisingspro-bleme in Oos-Kaapland, in die besonder Port Elizabeth, Albanie en Grahamstad. Daar is verskeie ondersoeke ingestel deur my departement&#x2014;ek praat hier van die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling&#x2014;na behuising veral vir Swartes in daardie gebied. Ons is ernstig bewus van die situasie. Die agb. lid het sekere moontlikhede genoem. Hy het gepraat van die betrokkenheid van die private sektor. Dit is reeds in die Komitee geargumenteer, ook die kwessie van sweetkapitaal ens. Die Viljoen-kommissie is tans besig of het reeds sy verslag uitgebring en dit word tans oorweeg. Ek dink die Minister kan in detail daarop antwoord.</p>

<p>Dit is die eerste keer dat ek in die hoedanigheid van Adjunk-minister van Grond-sake in hierdie Komitee moet optree ten <span class="col_809-810" refersTo="page_0428"/>opsigte van hierdie begroting. Ek wil van die geleentheid gebruik maak om aan die agb. Minister baie dankie te s&#x00EA; dat hy die verAlbani troue het om sekere aspekte van sy departe ment aan my toe te vertrou, nl. grondsake. Op sy gewone saaklike, praktiese wyse het hy vir my opdragte gegee en ek voer hierdie opdragte met groot graagte uit. Die same-werking tussen hom en my is in die beste belange van ons taak, hoewel ek eintlik ook aan &#x2019;n ander departement verbonde is. Verskeie sprekers het die probleemvan die be-skikbaarheid van grond hier gestel, asook di&#x00E9; van die benutting van grond. Ek wil dadelik vir u s&#x00EA; dat ons in Suid-Afrika vinnig besig is om die posisie te bereik waar ons baie versigtig met grond sal moet werk, veral ten opsigte van die benutting daarvan.</p>

<p>Ek wil dadelik s&#x00EA; dat die besetting van grond deur mense op &#x2019;n ongeordende wyse, soos in Nyanga plaasgevind het, ook &#x2019;n wan-benutting van grond is. Ons kan nie toelaat dat mense op &#x2019;n ongeordende wyse hulself op grond kom vestig nie. Grond in Suid-Afrika, veral in die stedelike gebiede, word &#x2019;n baie duur kommoditeit. Ons moet der-halwe met groot erns kyk na hoe ons grond moet ontwikkel. Grond nie net in stedelike gebiede nie, maar ook die ontwikkeling en benutting van grond in Landelike gebiede. Ons moet die aantal wette in ag neem wat op grond betrekking het. Daar is 180 wette, ordonnansies, munisipale verordenings ens. Ons het te doen met &#x2019;n gekompliseerde aksie ten opsigte van die verkryging, verwerwing en registrasieproses in verband met grond. In die rasionalisasieproses is die Aktesafde-ling ook na hierdie departement oorgeplaas. Nou kan u begryp dat in &#x2019;n ontwikkellende land soos Suid-Afrika ho&#x00EB; eise aan die Akteskantoor gestel word ten opsigte van registrasie ingevolge &#x2019;n verskeidenheid van wette wat op grond betrekking het. Ek kan vir u enkele statistieke gee: In die tydperk van 12 maande vanaf 1 Junie 1980 tot 31 Mei 1981 is nie minder nie as 864 000 aktes geregistreer. In die maand Oktober 1980 het registrasies &#x2019;n hoogtepunt bereik toe &#x2019;n totaal van 85 248 aktes geregistreer is. Die minste aktes wat in een maand geregistreer is, was in April toe daar 65 000 aktes geregistreer is. &#x2019;n Gemiddeld dus van 75 000 per maand. Op 30 November 1980 was daar &#x2019;n agterstand van oor die 40 000 aktes wat op registrasie gewag het, maar danksy die toewyding van amptenare in hierdie departement, die lang ure wat hulle oortyd gewerk het, het ons die agterstand ingehaal en is dit op die oomblik maar 8 400.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Tekort aan personeel. Ek kom nou daarby. In Johannesburg het ons die agterstand afgewerk sodat ons op die oomblik geen agterstand het nie. Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n prestasie. As gevolg van die ekonomiese groei in die afgelope tyd kan u begryp dat die Akteskantoor besonder besig was, en het die departement versoek dat daar &#x2019;n ondersoek ingestel word oor die kwessie van sy amptenary. In hierdie verband is daar heelwat nuwe poste geskep en ons hoop dat die Kommissie vir Administrasie binnekort sy verslag sal uitbring. Ek is seker ons kan hierdie agterstand wat in die agt verskillende akteskantore in die RSA ontstaan het in die toekoms met groter doeltreffendheid hanteer.</p>

<p>Ek wil nog &#x2019;n aspek in verband met die akteskantore noem. Ons het op die oomblik, soos ek reeds ges&#x00EA; het, agt kantore. Ons wil die nodige lof aan die Hoofregistrateur toe-swaai vir die groot taak wat hulle verrig het. Ek is seker dat talie transportbesorgers wat daagliks met die akteskantoor te doen kry, in hierdie sienswyse sal deel. Suid-Afrika is, soos u weet, bekend as een van die lande met een van die beste akteregistrasiestelsels. Ons is baie trots daarop. Ek is bly dat ons nou &#x2019;n verbeterde postestruktuur kan aankondig.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Nelspruit het sy eerste toespraak gehou, waarmee ek hom van harte gelukwens; hy het sekere aspekte van waar-dasie aangehaal wat onder my ressorteer.

Dit was hoofsaaklik te wyte aan &#x2019;n groot persentasie waardasies wat namens die Suid-Afrikaanse Ontwik-kelingstrust gedoen is, wat tans, weens die konsolidasieproses, die grootste koper van grond in Suid-Afrika is. In 1977 het ons &#x2019;n komitee aangestel om ondersoek na die doeltreffendheid van waardasie in te stel. Die komitee het met sekere voorstelle na vore gekom. Die komitee het bestaan uit verteenwoordigers van die departement en die private sektor. Hulle het met twee belang-rike aanbevelings gekom, nl. dat daar beter beheer oor waardeerders moet wees en dat &#x2019;n registrasie van waardeerders moet plaas-vind om sodoende die beroep van waardeerder beter te orden.

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">ADJUNK-MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Baie dankie. &#x2019;n Baie belangrike aanbeveling van die komitee is aanvaar, nl. dat &#x2019;n databank in-gestel moet word, waar inligting oor vaste-eiendomverkope op rekord geplaas kan word, sodat waardeerders of enige persoon of instansie die feite oor die jongste ver-kooptransaksies kan bekom ten einde die heersende mark te kan bepaal. Soos u weet, koop die Staat teen markpryse. Die Staat moet net soos enige ander instansie die markmeganisme in aanmerking neem wanneer hy waardasies doen. Die waardasie van grond om die markprys te bepaal, is ongelukkig nie &#x2019;n eksakte wetenskap nie, daarom is dit noodsaaklik dat daar behoorlike opleiding van waardeerders moet wees. Ons hoop dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Raad van Waardeerders wat by die voorgestelde wet-gewing ingestel sal word, ho&#x00EB; prioriteit aan di&#x00E9; aspek sal gee. Daar kom nog te veel gevalle in Suid-Afrika voor waar waardeerders waardasies op vaste eiendom plaas wat 50&#x0025; en selfs 100&#x0025; van mekaar verskil. Ter-wyl die Staat nie daarop ingestel is om by iemand &#x2019;n &#x201C;bargain&#x201D; te koop nie, wil hy terselfdertyd ook nie te veel betaal nie. Dit is net so oneties. Ons probeer &#x2019;n beter waarda-siestelsel ontwikkel.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Valsbaai het na &#x2019;n beson-dere geval verwys, nl. die Theewaterskloof-skema. Die agb. lid vir Nelspruit het ook daarna verwys. Dit is &#x2019;n klassieke voorbeeld van hoedat waardasies kan verskil en hoedat indiwiduele mense in die proses benadeel kan word. Die Theewaterskloofskema is &#x2019;n tragiese geval. Ons is besig om weer daarna te kyk om te sien of ons die mense wat finansieel gely het, kan help. Ek het dit ook goed gedink om, veral wat betref aankope vir die Suid-Afrikaanse Ontwikkelingstrust, &#x2019;n nuwe benadering te volg. Dit is om sover as moontlik van plaaslike waardeerders gebruik te maak en om nie waardeerders van elders in te bring nie. Ons het ook &#x2019;n tweede stap gedoen wat van besondere belang is. Om in die geval van &#x2019;n spesifieke eiendom &#x2019;n norm vas te stel, moet transaksies wat reeds in die nabye omgewing plaasgevind het, in ag geneem word, maar nou kom dit voor dat waar &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n waardasie wil doen, daar nie noodwendig transaksies in die onmiddellike omgewing plaasgevind het nie. Dan het ons gevind dat as jy iemand van die plaaslike Landboukredietkomitee, wat die grond ken en die verskillende plase in &#x2019;n bepaalde distrik kan waardeer, betrek by die waardasie-proses, hy waardevolle hulp aan die benoemde waardeerder kan verleen by die bewerkstelliging van die waardasie. Ons het reeds &#x2019;n redelike mate van sukses behaal. Die inskakeling van die mense van Land-boukrediet het groter tevredenheid teweeg gebring, hoewel hulle nog verdere opleiding moet kry.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek nog &#x2019;n paar belangrike aspekte noem. Ek het aan die begin van my toespraak ges&#x00EA; dat ek dink grondbenutting word &#x2019;n baie belangrike aspek in Suid-Afrika. Die agb. lid vir Boksburg het na Staatsgrond binne stedelike gebiede verwys, wat daar l&#x00EA; en onbenut is. Dit geld ook ten opsigte van grond in damkomgebiede en binne besproeiingsgebiede. Ons het vroe&#x00EB;r jare by die uitl&#x00EA; van besproeiingsgebiede, toe mense nog nie trekkers gehad het nie en van trekdiere soos perde, muile en osse <span class="col_813-814" refersTo="page_0430"/>gebruik moes maak om die ploe&#x00EB; te trek, gemeenskaplike weiplase in die besproeiings-gebiede geproklameer. In sekere van die besproeiingsgebiede is bv. 125 000 ha gemeenskaplike weiveld. Ons het nou &#x2019;n stadium bereik waarin hierdie soort Staats-grond beter benut kan word deur die bestaande plase behoorlik te ontwikkel as weieenhede. Volgende jaar sal ons wetgewing indien om die Minister die nodige magtiging te gee om aan hierdie vereiste te kan voldoen.</p>

<p>In die kort tyd tot my beskikking wil ek ook &#x2019;n ander aspek van grondbenutting noem en dit is gevalle van onbenutte Staats-grond binne damkomme. Met verloop van tyd koop ons grond vir &#x2019;n dam aan. Die watervlak van die damkom word vasgestel, maar uit die aard van die saak koop jy nie net tot by die bepaalde oppervlak nie, jy koop ook plase rondom die dam uit. In die proses verwerf jy grond wat die Staat nie noodwendig nodig het vir die doeleindes van besproeiing of die opgaar van water nie. Ons het nou die stadium bereik dat ons na hierdie situasie moet kyk. Die meeste van hierdie grond word tans onder huurskemas aan aangrensende boere beskikbaar gestel. Die provinsies beskik ook oor di&#x00E9; soort grond en wend dit aan vir natuurbewaring. Mense wil graag naby die water wees om te ski en so meer. Ons sal die beter landboukundige benutting van hierdie Staatsgrond moet oor-weeg. Ek kan in hierdie stadium nie die ver-sekering gee dat die ondersoek finaal is nie. Ons kyk nog wat die moontlikhede van so &#x2019;n ondersoek sal wees, want u sal self begryp dat dit &#x2019;n ingewikkelde ondersoek is. Daar is baie instansies by die hele aangeleentheid betrokke. Ons gaan ernstig hierna kyk omdat dit die beleid van die departement is, en in die besonder van die afdeling waarmee ek te doen het, om sover as moontlik grond ekonomies te benut en aan te wend vir die doeleindes wat in die beste belang van die gemeenskap is en ook van die ekonomie van die land in die algemeen.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. J. VAN DER LINDE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek stem saam met die agb. Adjunk-minister se kommentaar oor die Akteskantoor. Ek onthou watter ophoping daar was toe eiendomstransaksies by &#x2019;n vorige geleentheid ook so &#x2019;n hoogkonjunk-tuur bereik het. Hierdie keer was die ver tragings nie so lank nie. Nou neem eiendom-transaksies af en ophopings sal seker een van die dae iets van die verlede wees, altans so hoop elke praktiserende prokureur.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag die Minister se aandag vestig op &#x2019;n probleemin Port Elizabeth, nl. Sidwell, wat in my kiesafdeling gelee is. Ek weet die agb. Minister ken daardie gebied; hy het tevore al daar besoek afgel&#x00EA;. Ter wille van ander agb. lede sal ek net &#x2019;n kort beskrywing van die gebied en sy ligging gee. Die gebied l&#x00EA; noord van die middestad; word aan die suidekant deur &#x2019;n klomp fabrieke begrens, die grootste waarvan General Motors is; aan die noordekant word dit insgelyks begrens deur fabrieke, en ook die Algoaparkwoongebied; aan die oostekant is die spoorlyn, die snelwe&#x00EB; en die see; en aan die westekant word die gebied ook deur fabrieke begrens. Daar is ongeveer 1 200 wooneenhede in die gebied, waarvan ongeveer 525 deur die departement gebou is en 150 deur die plaaslike owerheid. Die ander 525 is in privaatbesit. Daar is twee prim&#x00EA;re skole en twee N.G.-kerkgemeentes. Binne loopafstand van die gebied is nog &#x2019;n prim&#x00EA;re skool en een van die grootste ho&#x00EB;rskole in Kaapland, nl. die Ho&#x00EB;rskool Cilliers wat, terloops, die eerste Afrikaansmedium skool in Port Elizabeth was.</p>

<p>Die probleemvan die gebied is dat die woonkomponent daarvan op &#x2019;n planlose basis bedreig word deur besigheids-en nywerheidsindringing. Ek wil dadelik s&#x00EA; dat daar myns insiens nie verdere behoefte bestaan aan grond vir nywerhede en besigheids-doeleindes in die gebied nie. Ter stawing van di&#x00E9; stelling kan ek meld dat die departement toevallig verlede jaar &#x2019;n opname gemaak het, en dat die opname getoon het dat daar 116 erwe vir besigheidsdoeleindes gesoneer is maar nog nie as sulks ontwikkel is nie. Die agb. lid vir Walmer sal saamstem dat &#x2019;n besigheidserf ontwikkel moet word, anders is daar geen behoefte daaraan nie. Daarteenoor is daar 43 erwe wat vir nywer-heidsdoeleindes gesoneer is en wat ook nog nie as sulks ontwikkel is nie. Dit is myns insiens &#x2019;n duidelike bewys dat in daardie gebied nie &#x2019;n behoefte aan besigheidserwe of erwe wat vir nywerheidsdoeleindes gesoneer is, bestaan nie. Ons weet ook dat daar in Port Elizabeth baie grond beskikbaar is vir nywerheidsuitbreiding. Dit is waar dat daar ongeveer 60 woonerwe is, erwe wat vir <span class="col_815-816" refersTo="page_0431"/>woningsdoeleindes gesoneer is en wat nie ontwikkel is nie. Ek wil vir u beleefd ter oor-weging gee dat die redes daarvoor in die eerste plek ho&#x00EB; koste is. Dit is &#x2019;n gebied waar mense met lae inkomstes lewe. &#x2019;n Ander belangrike faktor waarom daardie woonerwe nie ontwikkel is nie, is juis hierdie nywer-heidsindringing. Ek wil dit aan u stel: Hoe sal u voel as u vandag &#x2019;n woonhuis bou en twee jaar later open &#x2019;n paneelklopper sy besigheid langs u? Dit is nie iets wat bevorderlik is vir die bou van woonhuise nie.</p>

<p>Die Stadsraad van Port Elizabeth het so lank terug soos 1953 &#x2019;n beplanningskema vir daardie gebied aangekondig. Dit het &#x2019;n duidelike verdeling tussen die woonkomponent, nywerheidskomponent en die besigheids-komponent voorsien. Waar daar afwykende gebruike was, is die gebruike vir &#x2019;n tydperk van 40 jaar, d.w.s. tot die jaar 1993, min of meer 12 jaar vorentoe, toegelaat. In daardie stadium was daar nie, soos tans, die voor-siening dat indien &#x2019;n eienaar se grond nadelig geaffekteer word deur hersonering, hy vergoed kan word vir die skade wat hy ly nie. Oor die jare, na 1953, en veral na 1967, het &#x2019;n aantal eienaars aansoek gedoen om woonerwe te hersoneer. In &#x2019;n stadium toe daar ongeveer 10 aansoeke voor die Stadsraad gedien het, het die destydse LUK van Kaapland, belas met plaaslike bestuur, tans die agb. lid vir Sondagsrivier, &#x2019;n vergadering van Stadsraadslede, amptenare en ander belanghebbendes bel&#x00EA;, waar die aan-geleentheid bespreek is. Die Stadsraad het weer eens &#x2019;n ondersoek deur sy beplanners gelas en in 1976 is &#x2019;n verslag uitgebring waarin aanbeveel is dat die woonkomponent behou en versterk moet word, dat die bederf van die woongebied deur nywerheidsindring-ing gestaak moet word en dat stedelike hernuwing op &#x2019;n beperkte skaal toegepas moet word. Dit was in 1976. Daardie aanbevelings het die Stadsraad aanvaar en dit is na die provinsie gestuur en ook deur die provinsie aanvaar. Vir die inwoners van Sidwell was dit &#x2019;n blye dag; hulle het gedink dit is &#x2019;n nuwe era wat oor Sidwell daag. Dit het egter nie gebeur nie. Partikuliere belange het gou weer die planne begin rysmier. Die Stadsraad wat die aanbevelings aanvaar het, het nie sy besluit gehandhaaf nie. So het daar &#x2019;n eienaar wie se huis tussen ander goeie huise staan, sy agterplaas gebruik om sy vragmotors te herstel. Die geraas wat veroorsaak is, selfs tot laat in die nag, het natuurlik die inwoners gesteur. Die Stadsraad het egter, behalwe om &#x2019;n brief aan die man te skryf, niks gedoen om die regulasies af te dwing nie. In &#x2019;n ander geval het &#x2019;n slaghuiseienaar aansoek gedoen om sy vragmotors op &#x2019;n woon perseel te parkeer. Vroeg in die oggend veroorsaak die vragmotors ook geraas, en die bewoners van die naburige huise het by die stadsraad beswaar aan-geteken teen hierdie besondere aansoek. Die eienaar het toe &#x2019;n prokureursfirma opdrag gegee om aan al die beswaarmakers &#x2019;n brief te skryf en van elkeen van hulle R2 000 se skadevergoeding te eis vir beweerde laster. Verheel jou, wanneer mense hul regte wil uitoefen, word hulle van laster beskuldig! Die storie wat ek so pas vertel het, is eintlik die verhaal van Sidwell, en nou het Sidwell by die departement om hulp kom aanklop. Die Belastingbetalersver-eniging van Sidwell het die streekskantoor van die departement genader. In Augustus verlede jaar is daar weereens &#x2019;n vergadering gehou wat alle belanghebbendes bygewoon het, sekere van die bewoners van Sidwell en sekere amptenare van die stadsraad, en die vergadering is onder die voorsitterskap van die Direkteur-generaal gehou. Op daardie vergadering is daar eenparig besluit dat die gebied bevries moet word, en na die beste van my wete is dit tans nog die posisie. Die stadsraad het gevra vir tyd om gewysigde planne vir Sidwell in te dien. Ek wil egter beleefd aan die hand doen dat die onder-soeke reeds afgehandel is. Al wat dus gedoen moet word, is om by die besluite van 1976 te bly en hulle dan ook uit te voer. Met ander woorde, stadshemuwing moet op &#x2019;n beperkte gebied daar toegepas word. Verwaarloosde huise en slum eiendomme moet uitgekoop en opgeruim word&#x2014;in sommige gevalle sal bestaande huise net verbeter moet word&#x2014;en nywerheidsindringing moet stopgesit word. Ek wil oor hierdie saak &#x2019;n spesiale pleidooi aan die agb. Minister lewer. Oor hierdie vraag voel ek eintlik soos &#x2019;n boer wat sy landerye goed bewerk het deur kunsmis en water op die regte tye toe te dien, maar wat moet toesien hoe die lande kort voor oestyd deur &#x2019;n plaag bedreig word. In hierdie geval is die plaag nywerheidsindringing. Daar wag op ons &#x2019;n ryp oes indien ons die plaag suksesvol kan bestry.</p>

<from><span class="col_817-818" refersTo="page_0432"/>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. C. CRONJ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is natuurlik nie vertroud met die spesifieke probleemvan die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth Noord nie, maar ek hoop die winde van verandering sal deur sy kontrei waai en al die plae wegwaai wat hy daar ondervind.</p>

<p>Net voor ek oor behuising as sodanig gesels, wil ek net melding maak van die klein Kleurlinggroepie in die dorp Greytown. Dit is &#x2019;n baie klein gemeenskappie en tot 10 April 1981 het hulle nie &#x2019;n groepsgebied van hul eie gehad nie. Hulle was toe baie bly toe daar aangekondig is dat hulle hul eie groepsgebied sou h&#x00EA;, want hulle het gevoel dat die Regering nou wel hul bestaan as &#x2019;n groepie daar erken.</p>

<p>Daar is egter twee dinge wat hulle nou begin pla. Toe hulle gesien het watter gebied aan hulle toegeken is, was hulle nie baie tevrede nie. &#x2019;n Ander ding wat hulle gepla het, was &#x2019;n snaakse sin in &#x2019;n brief wat oor die saak gegaan het. Dit het so gelui&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloureds presently living in the Indian area have, in fact, now become disqualified persons.</block>

<p>Hierdie twee dinge laat die idee by hulle posvat dat daar moontlik bybedoelings, naamlik hul verskuiwing uit Greytown kan wees. Ek wil die agb. Minister dus vra of hy in die eerste plek die versekering kan gee dat hulle wel in Greytown sal bly. Tweedens, omdat die spesifieke terrein ook nie die goedkeuring van die dorpsraad wegdra nie, kan die agb. Minister miskien weer eens na die terrein kyk, maar hierdie keer in samewerking met die Kleurling-en Blanke gemeenskap?</p>

<p>Die verskil tussen die Regering en die Opposisie se benadering tot behuising is deur agb. lede oorkant hier geskets. Daar is beweer dat die Regering almal in baie mooi huise wil plaas, terwyl die Opposisie almal in krotte of slums wil laat woon. Dit is natuurlik nie so eenvoudig nie. Die Opposisie wens natuurlik ook elkeen &#x2019;n paleis toe. Vir elke badkamer wat die Regering die mense in hul huis toewens, wens die Opposisie hulle ook nog &#x2019;n stort toe. Ons wil dus altyd vir hulle net &#x2019;n bietjie meer gee, maar die saak is te ernstig om ons toe te laat om mekaar met ons droomvoorstelle of wensdenkery te wil oorbie. Ons moet die verskil eintlik op &#x2019;n ander gebied gaan soek.</p>

<p>Na my mening is die werklike verskil eintlik &#x2019;n tydskaalverskil. Ek dink die Regering is in &#x2019;n soort &#x201E;time-warp&#x201D; wanneer dit kom by hul benadering tot die verskaffing van behuising. Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad aanvaar dat die Regering wel &#x2019;n prysenswaardige eindtoestand in gedagte het, maar ons bevraagteken die bereiking van die eindtoestand oor die kort termyn. Om dus teen wil en dank met die ou strategie voort te gaan, veroorsaak na ons mening sosiale en ekonomiese probleme oor die kort en medium termyn.</p>

<p>Ek dek basies die hele spektrum. Ek sal egter nog daar uitkom. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad besef ook dat die eindtoestand een probleemoplewer, maar dat die werklikhede waarmee ons nou te doen het, ook &#x2019;n ander probleemoplewer en dat daar dus twee verskillende strategie&#x00EB; vir die oplossing van die twee probleme moet wees. Wanneer ons dus praat van gekontrolleerde plakkery of sogenaamde selfhelpskemas, praat ons nie van &#x2019;n eindtoestand nie. Ons verwys bloot na &#x2019;n tipe oorgangsbehuising om mense te help totdat hulle beter behuising kan bekom.</p>

<p>Di&#x00E9; werklikhede word erken deur finansiers, tegniese mense, landboukundiges, ekolo&#x00EB;, ekonome, ingenieurs, beplanners, ens. Met my ondervinding van massabe-huisingskemas, in my professionele hoedanigheid, weet ek dat daar baie van die plaaslike owerhede, asook amptenare in Regeringsdepartemente is wat saamstem dat daar wel na &#x2019;n nuwe totale strategie gekyk moet word. Daar is byvoorbeeld die Institute vir Behuisingsbestuur, argitekte, beplanners, ens., wat s&#x00EA; ons moet kyk na &#x2019;n alternatiewe strategie.</p>

<p>Ek wil dus aan die agb. Minister &#x2019;n aanbod maak.</p>

<p>&#x2026; sal ons belowe om nie te s&#x00EA; &#x201E;W&#x00EA;! Ons het so ges&#x00EA;&#x201D; nie. Die Regering kan dan die eer daarvoor self inpalm.</p>

<p>Nou wil ek graag net twee punte opper in verband met die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap in Natal. Die Groepsgebiedewet beperk die beskik-bare ruimte. Daar is dus meer aanvraag as beskikbare erwe. In daardie beperkte beleggingsveld vind &#x2019;n mens dat Indi&#x00EB;rsake-manne met baie geld die erwe as &#x2019;n belegging opkoop omdat hulle b.v. nie in die sentrale stadsgebied kantoorblokke, ens., met hul beskikbare geld kan oprig nie. Wanneer die departement wel groter gebiede be-skikbaar stel, in samewerking met die plaas-like owerhede, word daar huise daarop opgerig sodat die mense hulself nie kan help nie. Die Indi&#x00EB;rgemeenskap is &#x2019;n ondernemende gemeenskap. Hulle woel en werskaf oor naweke en help om mekaar om huise te bou. Ek dink daar kan dus met vrug daarna gekyk word om meer erwe beskikbaar te stel, veral vir diegene in die laerinkomste-groepe.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n ander aspek wat daarmee saam-val. Die departement s&#x00EA; hy bou gemeen-skappe en kyk na die kuituur van die mense as sodanig. Ek dink egter nie die massabe-huisingskemas vir Indi&#x00EB;rs het nog ooit in aanmerking geneem dat die uitgebreide familie, die &#x201E;extended family&#x201D; van tradisionele belang vir daardie mense is nie.</p>

<p>Daar is ook &#x2019;n paar punte wat, sover my kennis strek, nog nie in hierdie debat geop-per is nie. Die standaarde van huise wat die departement aanbied, is laer as di&#x00E9; wat die plaaslike owerhede private persone toelaat om te bou. Die private ondernemers wat dus wel huise wil bou, kan nie kompeteer nie omdat die departement &#x2026;</p>

<p>Die standaard van dienste wat vasgel&#x00EA; word, is soms te hoog. In &#x2019;n subekonomiese behuisingskema kry ons dikwels strate wat 4,2 meter wyd is, met wye sypaadjies, ens., terwyl daar in die beste Blanke woongebiede soos Kloof en Water-kloof, Hilton, ens., nou straatjies is met smal sypaadjies en stormwaterslote wat met gras beplant is. Ek is baie seker daarvan dat baie mense in behuisingskemas &#x2019;n &#x00BD;-meter se straat sal opoffer vir die gerief van &#x2019;n handwasbak in die huis.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by eweredige verspreiding of gelyke huurtariewe. Ek weet daar word nou planne beraam om dit in te stel, maar ek weet daar is &#x2019;n klomp plaaslike owerhede wat met die problemsit dat hulle nie aan-gepas het nie. Nou is nuwe skemas egter soveel duurder as ouer skemas dat mense nie van die ou skemas na die nuwe skemas wil trek nie.</p>

<p>Daar is ook die kwessie van die verspreiding in die aanbod van huise deur departementele skemas. Daar word te min van die beter klas huise aangebied en die mense wil dus nie ouer tipe huise, wat ook kleiner is, <span class="col_821-822" refersTo="page_0434"/>vir die nuwe skemas verlaat nie. Daar is dus geen opwaartse beweging nie, en die rede daarvoor is dat daar &#x2019;n te klein verskil in huisgroote is tussen sekere nuwe skemas en die ou skemas.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag aan die agb. lid vir Greytown s&#x00EA; dat hierdie departement aan my afdoende bewys gelewer het van die feit dat hy altyd bereid is om na goeie advies te luister. Ek het die afgelope week nog voorstelle van &#x2019;n kieser oor goedkoopbehuising na die departement deurgestuur. Daardie agb. lid maak voorstelle oor plakkery, maar hy moet net weet dat plakkery deur kenners dwarsoor die w&#x00EA;reld as ongewens bestempel word. Hierdie Regering gaan hom dus nie deur plakkery laat lei nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook gepraat van straat-wydtes. Stadsrade in Suid-Afrika het egter die Buro vir Standaarde genader en die Buro vir Standaarde het &#x2019;n kode vasgel&#x00EA; waarvolgens die stadsrade hul beplanning doen.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou graag verwys na stadsvernu-wing in die Johannesburgse gebied. Die agb. Minister weet van die probleme wat ons al daar gehad het. So groot was die probleme dat ek in die agb. Raad kritiek teen die huidige agb. Minister se voorganger uitgespreek het oor die stappe wat gedoen is. Daar was drie protesvergaderings in my kiesafdeling en baie misverstande het ontstaan. Ek wil graag by hierdie geleentheid aan die agb. Minister s&#x00EA; dat daardie misverstande nou uit die weg geruim is. Op die oomblik is daar &#x2019;n baie goeie verhouding tussen my en die streekverteenwoordiger, mnr. Dirk Ros-souw. Die agb. Minister kan maar vergeet van enige probleme daar, want daar gaan dinge nou goed. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Vanaand wil ek praat van die duisende Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs wat teenstrydig met die landswette in die middestad van Johannesburg en in Hillbrow ingetrek het en wat wooneenhede&#x2014;d.w.s. woonhuise en woon-stelle&#x2014;wat vir Blankes bedoel is, oorgeneem het. Daar is seker &#x2019;n goeie 10 000 Kleurlinge en Asi&#x00EB;rs wat daar woon.</p>

<p>Strydig met die landswette okkupeer duisende van hierdie mense woonstelle en woonhuise wat vir Wit mense bedoel is. Die posisie vererger omdat Kleurlinge van die Kaap en Indi&#x00EB;rs van Natal in steeds groter getalle daar intrek. Dit is &#x2019;n situasie wat op konfrontasie met die Regering afstuur, en geen Regering met enige selfrespek kan so &#x2019;n opsetlike verbreking van sy landswette verduur nie.</p>

<p>Daar het toe die volgende vraag by my <span class="col_823-824" refersTo="page_0435"/>ontstaan: As &#x2019;n mens hierdie verskynsel in Johannesburg ontleed, wat vind jy is dit eintlik? Is dit verdringing? Die agb. Eerste Minister het riglyne neergel&#x00EA; om aan te dui wat verdringing is. Hy het ges&#x00EA; die blote teenwoordigheid van anderskleuriges is nie verdringing nie, en ek stem met hom saam daaroor. Wanneer die eiendomlike van die Witman egter geaffekteer word, soos daar in daardie gebied, is dit wel verdringing. Na my mening is dit egter nie net verdringing nie. Dit is inderdaad ook &#x2019;n vorm van gesofistikeerde plakkery. Dit is ook &#x2019;n geval van die blatante minagting van die landswette. Dit bied ook grootskaalse geleentheid vir eienaars of &#x201E;landlords&#x201D; om mense uit te buit. Ek het ernstig oor hierdie saak nagedink. Wat my betref, is hierdie kombinasie van verdringing, plakkery en minagting van wet en orde &#x2019;n verskynsel wat genoem word &#x201E;burgerlike ongehoorsaamheid&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Die vraag is dan watter invloed dit op die Regering het. Hier moet ons mekaar in die o&#x00EB; kyk en besef dat die Nasionale Party &#x2019;n ononderhandelbare beginsel van afsonder-like woonbuurtes het, soos bevestig deur die huidige agb. Eerste Minister, asook die voormalige Eerste Minister. As gevolg hiervan het ons probleme, konfliksituasies wat ontstaan tussen verskillende mense. Ons het kiesers wat ons dit kwalik neem dat dit wel die situasie is. Ek wil aansluit by wat die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes ges&#x00EA; het oor die probleme wat in so &#x2019;n mate daaruit voortspruit dat die Nasionale Party selfs gevra word waarom hy nie sy beginsel van afsonderlike woonbuurtes afdwing nie.</p>

<p>Daar bestaan na my mening dringende redes waarom daar opgetree moet word. Daar is verkiesingbeloftes gemaak dat die beginsel van afsonderlike woonbuurtes inderdaad gehandhaaf sal word; dat daar dringende stappe gedoen sal word vir die verwydering van daardie mense en dat stappe ook gedoen sal word om die eienaars te straf. Ek vra dus om optrede op grond van verkiesingsbeloftes wat gemaak is, en ek vra vir die agb. Minister se optrede op grond van &#x2019;n versekering wat deur sy voorganger by die Transvaalse Nasionale Party-kongres gegee is dat wetgewing inderdaad in hierdie verband ingedien sal word. Ek vra ook optrede op grond van die Nasionale Party se ononderhandelbare beginsel van afsonderlike woonbuurtes. Die optrede wat ek vra, is dat wetgewing ingedien moet word om die onwettige okkupeerder summier uit sy woonplek te kan sit. Ek vra ook vir strenger stappe teen die eienaars. Die boete wat eienaars opgel&#x00EA; word wat anderskleuriges so strydig met die Groepsgebiedewet huisves, moet drasties vermeerder word of die huurgeld moet verbeurd verklaar word.</p>

<p>My ander voorstel sluit aan by wat die agb. lid vir Langlaagte ges&#x00EA; het, en dit is dat daardie eenhede onder huurbeheer geplaas moet word. Hierdie stappe moet deur die Regering as stappe van ho&#x00EB; prioriteit gesien word. Ek vra die agb. Minister of die nodige stappe nie nog gedurende die huidige sessie gedoen kan word nie.</p>

<p>Ten slotte doen ek &#x2019;n beroep op die agb. Minister om hier &#x2019;n besliste standpunt in te neem waarin hy opnuut die Nasionale Party se beginsel van afsonderlike woonbuurtes vir daardie gebiede bevestig, waarin hy bevestig dat dit &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; Regeringsprioriteit is om onmiddellik en dringend stappe te doen om wetgewing ingedien te kry, en ook om te verklaar dat dit nie die Regering se plan is om Hillbrow, Jeppe of enige sentrale deel van Johannesburg as &#x2019;n groepsgebied vir Indi&#x00EB;rs of Kleurlinge te verklaar nie.

<speech by="#veldman">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. H. VELDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek glo dat die agb. Minister wel vir die agb. lid vir Jeppe goeie antwoorde sal h&#x00EA; vir die menigvuldige probleme wat hy in sy kies-afdeling het. Ek het gedink ek het baie moeilikhede in Rustenburg, maar ek dink die agb. lid vir Jeppe het baie meer.</p>

<p>Toe die departement op 1 April 1964 tot stand gekom het, was die opdrag van die destydse Eerste Minister die volgende, en ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must provide for, and assist in, the proper settlement and housing of all population groups, the development of sound communities and the removal, by way of slum clearance and urban renewal, of poor conditions impeding proper community development.</block>

<p>Dit is dan ook presies waarmee hierdie departement besig is. Ek wil sommer uit die staanspoor twee voorbeelde noem, een wat betrekking het op wooneenhede en die ander wat betrekking het op sentrale sakegebiede. <span class="col_825-826" refersTo="page_0436"/>Ek dink dat &#x2019;n sprekende voorbeeld van wat gebeur, is die Bloemhofwoonstelle in Distrik Ses, waar daar &#x2019;n onhoudbare situasie ontstaan het en daar uiteindelik besluit is dat die perseel ontruim, en die mense herbehuis word. Daar is toe besluit om as &#x2019;t ware van die dop van daardie woonstelblok, wat nog bruikbaar was, gebruik te maak deur dit te laat restoureer.</p>

<p>My ander voorbeeld staan in verband met &#x2019;n sentrale sakegebied by ons in Rustenburg. Oor baie jare het die residensi&#x00EB;le funksie van die sentrale sakegebied oorbenut geraak en het oorbewoning, en dikwels baie swak beplande en swak opgerigte geboue, ver-waarlosing en verval in die hand gewerk. As deel van sy opdrag, soos ek dit &#x2019;n rukkie gelede uitgespel het, het die departement dit vir die mense moontlik gemaak om herbe-huis te word en het die departement ook ander akkommodasie vir hul sakepersele verskaf. Die geleenthede is dus geskep vir herbeplanning en die totale hernuwing van die gebied.</p>

<p>Alvorens ek verder gaan, wil ek net graag die agb. Minister, sy Adjunkte en die amptenary baie gelukwens en bedank vir die wyse waarop hulle aandag aan hierdie grootse taak skenk en dit afgehandel kry. Ek sou sekerlik vir hulle nog baie meer kon bedank as Rustenburg ook nog die geld kon kry wat aangevra is vir die goedgekeurde behuisingskemas. As ek egter dankie s&#x00EA;, weet die agb. Minister dat ek dit opreg bedoel. Ek hoop natuurlik dat daar eendag nog wel iets sal bykom.</p>

<p>Dit is baie duidelik dat hierdie departement oor een saak geen onduidelikheid het nie, en dit is dat die verskaffing van behuising as deel van die stadsvernuwingsgedagte en die gedagte van sosio-ekonomiese opheffing een van die belangrikste metodes is om mense gelukkig te maak. Dit is ook vir die departement&#x2014;en dit is by herhaling uitgespel&#x2014;baie noodsaaklik dat daar &#x2019;n toenemende mate van samewerking moet wees tussen die Staat en die private sektor, wat eintlik hand-aan-hand hierdie sake moet hanteer, want dit is juis die gedagte van samewerking tussen plaaslike owerhede, die Sentrale owerheid, die provinsiale owerhede en die privaatsektor waarin die werklike sukses van die hele poging l&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Ek wil beweer dat daar niks met die staatsmasjinerie skort nie en dat die verskaffing van behuising en die vemuwing van stedelike en dorpsgebiede met sukses deur-gevoer sal kan word. Soos daar al by herhaling hier uitgewys is, is daar net een beperkende faktor Dit is nie &#x2019;n gebrek in die staatsmasjinerie nie, maar l&#x00EA; wel by die be-skikbare fondse wat vir hierdie doel aangewend moet word.</p>

<p>Kom ons kyk na die drie kategorie&#x00EB; van vereistes vir vemuwing. Eerstens sien ons dat koste wel &#x2019;n groot faktor is en, tweedens, dat dit &#x2019;n baie tydrowende proses is. In die eerste plek het ons te doen met die bevriesing van &#x2019;n sekere gebied, wat dan ook gepaard gaan met onteiening. Die geboue in die gebied moet dan gesloop word en die geheel moet dan herbeplan en herontwikkel word. In die tweede plek is daar gebiede waar restourasie en verbeterings die antwoord op die probleemis en, derdens, is daar gebiede waar voorsorgmaatre&#x00EB;ls die antwoord bied, soos hier in die Parlements-gebou waar daar voortdurend opknappings-werk gedoen word in &#x2019;n poging om te verhoed dat die gebou geleidelik meer en meer beskadig word. In die proses van die ver-nuwing van &#x2019;n stadsgebied is daar al by herhaling daarop gewys wat die rol van die privaatsektor behoort te wees. Ek dink een van die sterk dryfvere om die privaatsektor te stimuleer om aktief aan die uitvoering van hierdie taak deel te neem, sal wees die uit-skakeling, sover moontlik, van die rompslomp wat noodwendig met ontwikkeling van hierdie aard gepaard gaan. Rompslomp en administratiewe re&#x00EB;lings neem noodwendig tyd in beslag en kos noodwendig ook geld. &#x00DA;it &#x2019;n idealistiese oogpunt sal die Staat se taak in die proses alleen wees om toe te sien dat vemuwing en herbeplanning op &#x2019;n beplande wyse plaasvind om bepaalde ontwik-kelingsdoelwitte te bereik.</p>

<p>Dit bring my weer by die privaatsektor, op wie se skouers &#x2019;n groot verantwoordelikheid in hierdie verband rus. Om verskeie redes, wat ek nie nou tyd het om op te noem nie, is dit dikwels die kleinbelegger wat dit nie moontlik vind om in mededinging met groot-beleggers sy deel tot die vemuwingsaksie by te dra nie. Die Staat en die stadsvaders verwelkom natuurlik ontwikkeling van groot omvang deur grootbeleggers. Dit kan ek verstaan. In die proses wil ek egter &#x2019;n pleidooi lewer vir die kleinbelegger. In Rustenburg was d&#x00ED;t dan ook die persone wat oorspronklik <span class="col_827-828" refersTo="page_0437"/>die betrokke grond besit het en wat uiteindelik onteien is. Hulle sou egter graag weer van daardie grond wou bekom om &#x2019;n aandeel te kon h&#x00EA; in die vemuwingsproses. Die betrokke beheermaatre&#x00EB;ls sal natuurlik vanselfsprekend ook op hulle van toepassing wees, maar ons wil net nie h&#x00EA; dat hulle die geleentheid onts&#x00EA; word om ook daaraan deel te h&#x00EA; nie.</p>

<p>Op plaaslike owerhede rus daar &#x2019;n enorme verantwoordelikheid, nie net om deur hul verteenwoordiging op die staatskomitees, of deur die verskaffing van dienste, hul kant te bring nie, maar ook om toekomstendense te antisipeer sodat hulle sal weet wat om vir die bepaalde streek te wagte te wees. Dit geld natuurlik ook klein munisipaliteite wat in &#x2019;n snel ontwikkelende land soos die R.S.A. om &#x2019;n bepaalde rede bykans oornag in die kalklig te staan kan kom en vir wie dorpsbeplanning skielik &#x2019;n totale nuwe dimensie kan aanneem.</p>

<p>Die begin van die bevolkingsontploffing in die agtiende eeu, tesame met die onge&#x00EB;we-naarde verstedelikingsproses gedurende die laat agtiende eeu en vroe&#x00EB; negentiende eeu, het gelei tot toestande wat nie weer mag ontstaan nie. &#x2019;n Plaaslike owerheid mag nie, soos in daardie tye, deur die veranderde omstandighede van verstedeliking en die gevolge daarvan, of as gevolg van streeks-ontwikkelingsplanne, onklaar betrap word nie. Plaaslike owerhede en die sentrale owerheid mag nie toelaat dat werkers uitgebuit word soos hulle in die vroe&#x00EB; dae van die industri&#x00EB;le revolusie deur nyweraars, spekulante, bouers en grond-en gebou-eienaars uitgebuit is nie. Ek haal aan om aan te dui wat destyds gebeur het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The miserable working conditions transformed large areas into dismal slums, a process aggravated by speculators who hastily erected cheap, ugly and unsanitary tenement houses.</block>

<p>Dit mag nie weer gebeur nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. G. VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, hier is al baie in hierdie debat gepraat oor die kwessie van behuising en wie vir behuising verantwoordelik sal wees wanneer mense huise nodig het. Dit het my gedagtes laat teruggaan na die tyd toe ons as plattelanders ons skredes na die stad gewend het. Voordat ek as plattelandse seun na die stad verhuis het, het ek &#x2019;n vorm ingevul en aan die Direkteur van Onderwys gestuur en gevra of ek &#x2019;n werk kan kry. Toe ek in die stad aangekom het, was dit my persoonlike taak om seker te maak dat ek &#x2019;n nessie gehad het waarin ek kon l&#x00EA;. Ek kan nog onthou hoe ek in die kinderhuis in Lang-laagte in &#x2019;n eensame kamertjie moes bly en self vir my eie eetgoedjies en wasgoed moes sorg. Ek het nie na &#x2019;n Minister of &#x2019;n Regering gehardloop nie. Ek het nie gaan plak nie. Langs hierdie pad is ek ordentlik opgevoed.</p>

<p>In die gees van die hele debat wat ons hier voer, het ek na die wetgewing van hierdie Regering gaan kyk. Ek het gesien dat die Regering in 1966 wetgewing aanvaar het wat vandag nog nie deur die oorkant van die Raad aanvaar word nie, te wete die Wet op Groepsgebiede. Ek het daardie stuk wetgewing deeglik deurgelees en al wat ek daarin gekry het&#x2014;iets wat ek heelhartig wil ondersteun&#x2014;is die feit dat die Regering besluit het dat daar een manier is waarop hy sy wil om sinvolle regering in hierdie land te h&#x00EA;, kan uitvoer en dit is om aan elke volk in hierdie land &#x2019;n eie leefruimte soos eie woongebiede, eie skole en &#x2019;n eie gemeenskapslewe te bied. Van watter hoek &#x2019;n mens ook al die wetgewing lees, was dit allermins die bedoeling dat dit as &#x2019;n diskriminerende wet beskou moes word. Ons erken met daardie wetgewing die <span class="col_829-830" refersTo="page_0438"/>andersheid en eiesoortigheid van mense in die verskeidenheid van volkere en die eiendomlike van almal. Artikel 19 van daardie wet verleen aan anderskleurige handelaars die geleentheid om deur middel van &#x2019;n aan-soek, wat gevolg word deur &#x2019;n grondige ondersoek en &#x2019;n sinvolle proklamasie, &#x2019;n permit te bekom wat aan hulle sakeregte in &#x2019;n Blanke gebied sal gee. Hierdie proses lyk vir my heeltemal ordelik en in die gees van die beleid van &#x2019;n Regering waarin daar met groot deernis na die behoeftes van ander mense omgesien word. Die Regering het dus vir hierdie mense die geleentheid geskep om langs daardie weg as sakemanne in sekere gebiede tot hulle reg te kom. Ek laat die saak voorlopig daar.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Minister en sy departement van harte gelukwens met een van die mooiste prototipes van hierdie reeling wat hulle verlede jaar in Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain ten uitvoer gebring het. Wanneer mens die Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain-opset bestudeer, sien jy dat afgesien van die huise wat gebou is, daar ook 122 sake-ondernemings daar gestig is. Wat ek egter nie geweet het nie, was dat daar meer as 2 000 aansoeke vir die bedryf van daardie 122 sake-ondernemings was. Dit gee &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n idee van hoe gewild die idee van eie besighede in eie gemeenskappe onder eie mense geword het. Tot op hede is daar nog steeds &#x2019;n waglys van meer as 60 mense wat daar sake-ondernemings wil begin. Dit bewys hoe lewensvatbaar sake-ondernemings vir mense in hulle eie gemeenskappe kan wees. As die saak verder gevoer word en toestemming verleen word vir die stigting van nog sake-ondernemings, het ek die versekering gekry dat daar nog honderde sakemanne is wat die geleentheid afwag om daar ondernemings te begin.</p>

<p>Dit is tog die gees waarin dit moet gebeur. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens met die huurders van hierdie sake-ondernemings gaan praat, vind &#x2019;n mens dat hulle uiters tevrede is met die voorwaardes wat die Staat gestel het. Hulle is uiters suksesvol met die hantering van hulle ondernemings. Ons moet besef dat die laagste rendement waarvoor sakemanne in hierdie gebied voorsiening maak, 12&#x0025; is, terwyl dit tot 16&#x0025; kan wees. Dan s&#x00EA; sommige van ons nog dat daar nie vir hierdie mense lewensruimte is nie. Dan s&#x00EA; sommige nog dat daar nie vir hierdie mense plek is om &#x2019;n bestaan in hulle eie gemeenskappe te maak nie. Die bedoeling is tog dat daar vir elke gemeenskap in sy eie geledere ten minste &#x2019;n kafee, &#x2019;n slaghuis, &#x2019;n kruidenierswinkel, &#x2019;n klerewinkel, kantore vir sy beroeps-mense en dies meer moet wees. Hy moet tog ook sy eie inkomstebronne h&#x00EA; sodat gemeenskapsontwikkeling kan plaasvind. Sodoende sal &#x2019;n gemeenskap dan binne sy eie leefruimte die vermo&#x00EB; h&#x00EA; om werkge-leenthede aan sy eie mense te verskaf. As gevolg van die druk van Blanke pleitbesor-gers word daar nou ges&#x00EA; dat mense nie daar &#x2019;n bestaan kan maak nie. Dit is onwaar. Daar word ook ges&#x00EA; dat hulle nie voldoende gedifferensieerd is nie. Dit kan moontlik waar wees, maar ons moet almal aan die volle ekonomiese proses deelneem. Ons moet dus leer om te differensieer ten opsigte van die ondememings wat ons aanpak. Dit kan egter nie &#x2019;n rede wees waarom hierdie dinge nie kan plaasvind nie. Deur middel van wanpraktyke word daar gepoog om hierdie hele aangeleentheid hand-uit te laat ruk.</p>

<p>In hierdie verband wil ek na &#x2019;n bepaalde wanpraktyk verwys. Dit is iets waarna ek wil h&#x00EA; die agb. Minister moet kyk. Ek verwys nou na die feit dat genomineerdes nou namens <i>de</i> <i>facto</i>-eienaars optree. Daar is Blankes wat namens anderskleuriges in Blanke gebiede handelslisensies verkry, maar self nooit fisies by daardie sake-onderneming betrokke nie.</p>

Ek wil vra of &#x2019;n kwasi-geregtelike liggaam nie aangestel kan word om vas te stel of so &#x2019;n sake-onderneming wel bedryf word deur die persoon wat die lisensie daarvoor verkry het nie. Totdat so &#x2019;n persoon bewys gelewer het dat hy wel aan die roer van so &#x2019;n sake-onderneming gaan staan, moet &#x2019;n lisensie nie toegestaan word nie. Hierdie wanpraktyk druis in teen artikel 19 van die wet waarvan ek melding gemaak het en wat met hierdie praktyke te doen het. Ingevolge hierdie artikel kan &#x2019;n anderskleurige wel aansoek om &#x2019;n permit vir hierdie doel doen, maar nou gebeur dit dat dit nie gedoen word nie. Daar word eerder van ander onwettige metodes gebruik gemaak om die wet te omseil. Hulle doen dan sake in gebiede waar hulle nie geregtig is om dit <span class="col_831-832" refersTo="page_0439"/>te doen nie. Enigeen wat hierdie bepaling in die wet teenstaan, is selfsugtig en soek net sy eie belang. Anderskleurige handelaars wat dit doen, gee nie &#x2019;n sners om vir die behoeftes van hulle eie gemeenskap nie. Blankes tree ook selfsugtig op deur te poog om die geld van anderskleuriges vir hom in sy gebied toe te eien deur middel van hierdie onwettige praktyk. Hulle maak hulle sodoende skuldig aan &#x2019;n oortreding van die wet.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n verdere aangeleentheid wat hiermee verband hou wat ek ook onder die aandag van die agb. Minister wil bring. Ek is van mening dat die begrip van oop handels-gebiede wat op die oomblik net op Blanke gebiede van toepassing is nie &#x2019;n goeie begrip is nie. Ek dra kennis van een groot konsortium wat in hierdie stadium reeds vir &#x2019;n verlies van R2 miljoen per jaar voorsiening maak as gevolg van winkeldiefstal omdat daar Vrydae en Saterdae ontsettende verdringing van mense by sy winkels plaas-vind. Dit is grotendeels daaraan te wyte dat die sakewyke waar groot besigheid gedoen word in hierdie stadium net in Blanke gebiede gele&#x00EB; is. Ek wil &#x2019;n ernstige beroep op die agb. Minister doen dat ons elke geleentheid tot ons beskikking sal gebruik om aan anderskleuriges hulle eie sakegeleent-hede in hulle eie lewensruimtes te gee. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die loop van my toespraak sal ek die aangeleentheid van oop of geslote sakewyke behandel. Ek wil egter aan die begin &#x2019;n paar sake onder die agb. Minister se aandag bring en aan hom &#x2019;n paar vrae stel.</p>

<p>Ek kan begryp dat die agb. Minister gekant is teen erf-en-diens-skemas en &#x2019;n verlaging van standaarde, maar in die jaarverslag van sy Departement word daar ges&#x00EA; dat daar elke jaar vir die volgende 10 jaar &#x2019;n bedrag van R882 miljoen vir behuising benodig word. Net R300 miljoen word egter vir hierdie doel bewillig. Ek wil nou vra wat die agb. Minister gaan doen om daardie gaping uit te wis. Hoe gaan hy in staat wees om huisvesting aan al die mense wat dit nodig het, te verskaf sonder dat hy van onorto-dokse boumetodes of &#x2019;n verlaging van standaarde gebruik maak?</p>

<p>If the hon. the Minister wants the building societies and the banks to become involved in low income group housing I want to point out to him that it is not their function to trade at a loss. The Central Government requires them to have a certain percentage of the equities held in Government stock, the Government should create Government housing stock. The hon. the Minister of Finance can then say: &#x201C;You can invest part of your 60&#x0025; you have to invest in Government stock in Government housing stock.&#x201D; This will create a vehicle whereby the lending institutions can lend money which will become part of their general security holdings.</p>

<p>The next subject I wish to deal with, is that of rent control.</p>

<p>Oor die kwessie van huurbeheer is daar deur die agb. Minister weer politiek gespeel. Aan die een kant is daar ges&#x00EA; dat dit geleidelik uitgeskuif moet word, maar aan die anderkant is daar voorwaardes gestel waar-volgens dit nie uitgeskuif kan word nie. Ek wil egter aan die agb. Minister s&#x00EA; wat ons houding is. Alhoewel die huidige stelsel van huurbeheer baie anomalie&#x00EB; bevat moet daar &#x2019;n vorm van huurbeheer op die Wetboek wees met betrekking tot gehuurde persele. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Die doel van hierdie beheer moet drieledig wees. Eerstens, moet dit die publiek in die algemeen teen misbruike, teistering en uitbuiting beskerm. Tweedens, moet dit spesiale beskerming en bystand verleen aan diegene wat dit nodig het. Dit is die minder gegoede mense, die oues van dae en diegene wat liggaamlik ongesteld is. Daar moet spesiale beskerming vir hulle wees. Derdens, moet daar verseker word dat die koste van hierdie verskaffing van beskerming en bystand deur die Staat gedra word, of op &#x2019;n meer eweredige grondslag as wat tans die geval is, versprei word.</p>

<p>Hierdie beginsels is beginsels wat gesonde beheer sal verseker en wat sal voorkom dat net &#x2019;n klein groepie sakemanne &#x2019;n las dra wat eintlik deur die Staat gedra moet word.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think that much has happened in the property field since the Fouch&#x00E9; <span class="col_833-834" refersTo="page_0440"/>Commission investigated and reported a few years ago. There have been dramatic changes in the field of multi-unit housing. I believe that now the pot is getting off the boil, it is the occasion for a further investigation into the laws relating to the ownership and occupation of flats and other multi-unit dwellings. This investigation should consider the anomalies, the loopholes and the shortcomings in existing acts such as the Rent&#x2019;s Act, the Sectional Titles Act and the Share Blocks Control Act.</p>

<p>An investigation, because I think this thing has got out of hand and that a new situation pertains. There is a need for legislation in respect of time sharing schemes, which is something that is fairly new on the market. There is also a need to amend existing legislation to see that the objectives of the control which I have outlined are the ones that are met. I believe that this investigation should either be composed of people who have interests in this whole field or that evidence should be sought from all the people who are involved in the question in the ownership or occupation of flats or multi-unit dwellings. I believe a change has taken place and that the present situation is not satisfactory. A form of control has to be maintained and I believe that there should be an investigation at this stage as to the most desirable form of control.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I now want to move on quickly to the Group Areas Act. I am shocked that at the very time when we believe that we are getting rid of the discrimination, we now have the new word &#x201C;verdringing&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Dit is nou &#x2019;n nuwe Transvaalse woord en dit verbaas my dat die agb. Minister dit sommer net so geredelik aanvaar. Die agb. Minister is tog seker nie te vinde vir hierdie woord nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die nuwe woord &#x201E;verdringing&#x201D; is nou die aanvaarde nuwe woord met betrekking tot die toepassing van die Wet op Groepsgebiede. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit verbaas my dat ons in hierdie stadium die wiel probeer terugdraai en &#x2019;n verkrampte houding inslaan met betrekking tot die toepassing van die Wet op Groepsgebiede.</p>

He did not talk about &#x201C;verdringing&#x201D; and about apartheid, but said that it was not in terms of Government policy. What I want to ask him, is why Government policy is what it is. Go to the Golden Acre down the road here which was built by Sanlam. You will find people there shopping and lunching together. They will be in the boutiques together. There are three cinemas there, but it is against Government policy that they should be in those cinemas together. At the prices those cinemas charge, I can assure the Minister that there are not going to be large scale &#x201C;verdringing&#x201D; there.</p>

<p>Ek het ongelukkig nie die tyd nie. As ek meer tyd gegun word, sal ek &#x2019;n vraag beantwoord.</p>

<p>I want to know from the hon. the Minister when he is going to change the regulation which prohibits non-Whites from being managers where there are White employees in businesses. He knows that this has been observed in the breach all around the country already and I want to ask him when he is going to deal with this particular matter.</p>

<p>I want to know too when he is going to fulfil the promise of the Government to open the central business districts to trading by all races. He will say he did something in Wynberg, but the Government has a commitment to open the central business districts on a general basis. We want to know when the hon. the Minister is going to do that. When is he going to open the industrial areas? Minister De Klerk, as Minister of Planning, said a year ago that the industrial areas were going to or could be opened. [Interjections.] We want to know when the central business districts and industrial areas are going to be open to people of all races. When is he going to complete this process?</p>

<p>What about District Six? I must come back to this matter. The hon. the Minister said that he has removed 836 Coloured families from Bloemhof flats in District Six. Rumour has it that when those flats have been remodelled they may be made available to less affluent people in the White community. I want to know from the hon. the Minister if this is correct. Minister De Klerk said that the reason why the Coloureds could not go back to District Six is that they could not afford to. It was going to be high income group housing and Coloured people could in fact not go back. I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether it is his intention to use those flats for people of the White group who qualify for assistance under the Housing Act. I say to him that if he is going to use it for old people it is an absolutely scandalous disgrace. If he is not going to do it, he must say so.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ons het nou weer die agb. lid vir Seepunt gehad wat kitsoplossings soek vir ons behuisingsprobleme. Ek wonder wat die agb. lid sal s&#x00EA; as ek vir hom s&#x00EA; dat die erfen-diensskemas op die lang termyn duurder is as konvensionele behuising.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. KLEYNHANS</person>:</from>

<p>Die enigste manier waarop &#x2019;n mens erf-en-diensskemas suksesvol kan instel, is as streng beheer toegepas word. In die eerste plek moet die erwe waarop daardie konstruksies geplaas word, afgemeet word. Dan moet dienste soos water en sanitasie aangel&#x00EA; word. Ek weet dat agb. lede van die Opposisie &#x2019;n emmerstelsel daar wil h&#x00EA;. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daar moet verder gekyk word na die soort konstruksies wat daar opgerig gaan word. Dan moet daar ook gelet word op die materiaal wat gebruik gaan word. Agb. lede moet ook nie vergeet dat die nasorgdiens wat plaaslike owerhede by so &#x2019;n erf-en-diensskema moet voorsien, geweldig duur is nie. Sodoende kos so &#x2019;n skema &#x2019;n mens uiteindelik baie duurder as konvensionele behuising.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Albanie het gister hier die geval genoem van klein Soweto naby Port Elizabeth. Ek is baie bly dat die agb. lid dit gedoen het, want my hart bloei vir daardie mense omdat hulle in sulke omstandighede moet woon. Ek wil egter vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; <span class="col_837-838" refersTo="page_0442"/>dat ons daar &#x2019;n tipiese voorbeeld het van wat met &#x2019;n erf-en-diensskema kan gebeur as dit nie beheer word nie. Daardie woongebied is oorspronklik as &#x2019;n erf-en-diensskema beoog, maar wat is dit vandag? Mense woon daar in &#x2019;n toestand van chaos omdat daardie skema nie beheer is nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil nie op die agb. lid vir Seepunt se ander aanvalle reageer nie, want ek is seker dat die agb. Minister dit sal doen. Ek wil egter van hierdie geleentheid gebruik maak om deur middel van die agb. Minister &#x2019;n woord van besondere dank te bring aan die streekskantoor van die Departement in Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Ja, Algoapark. Die mense sal dit hoog op prys stel as die moontlikheid hiervan gunstig oorweeg word.</p>

<p>Terwyl ek met versoeke besig is, wil ek na &#x2019;n ander aangeleentheid verwys. Ingevolge die Wet op Groepsgebiede kan die eienaar van &#x2019;n restourant nou aansoek doen om sy restourant vir alle rasse oop te stel. Dit is nou so dat &#x2019;n vyfst&#x00EA;rhotel of &#x2019;n hotel met internasionale status aan &#x2019;n kenteken uitgeken kan word. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens dan so &#x2019;n hotel besoek, weet jy dadelik dat dit &#x2019;n internasionale hotel is en wie daar mag tuisgaan. Dit is ongelukkig nie geval met restourante nie. Om verleentheid te voorkom, wil ek net vra of ons nie daaraan kan dink om ook by sulke restourante &#x2019;n kenteken aan te bring nie. Op die oomblik weet niemand of &#x2019;n bepaalde restourant intemasionale status het nie. &#x2019;n Persoon moet eers instap en vra of hy in &#x2019;n restourant bedien kan word. Miskien moet die eienaar dan vir hom s&#x00EA; dat hy nie kan nie en dit kan so &#x2019;n persoon in die verleentheid bring.</p>

<p>Hierdie begrotingspos wat met behuising te doen het, is oor die afgelope paar uur al taamlik uitgetrap. Ek wil net byvoeg dat daar basies drie dinge is wat &#x2019;n hardwerkende gesinsman van die samelewing verwag. Ek dink dat hy in die eerste plek &#x2019;n ordentlike dak oor sy kop verwag. In die tweede plek verwag hy &#x2019;n goeie inrigting waar sy kinders opgevoed kan word. In die derde plek verwag hy &#x2019;n mark waar hy sy arbeid kan verkoop. As ons hierdie drie ideale kan verwesenlik, kan ons &#x2019;n gelukkige samelewing en &#x2019;n standvastige bevolking verwag. Enige regdenkende Regering streef dus hierdie ideale vir sy bevolking na. Dit is waarom die Nasionale Party reeds sedert 1948 hierdie ideale nastreef.</p>

<p>Met die bespreking van hierdie begrotingspos streef ons die eerste ideaal na, naamlik die een van behuising. Daar kan gevra word watter sukses ons behaal het in die nastrewing van hierdie ideale. Ek wil nie weer baie syfers aanhaal nie, want die agb. Minister het gister vir ons ges&#x00EA; wat daar oor die afgelope vyf jaar gedoen is. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat daar 160 000 huise gebou is. Het ons al ooit oor hierdie syfer nagedink? Dit beteken 117 goedgeboude huise per werksdag. Gemeet aan enige standaarde is dit voorwaar &#x2019;n voortreflike prestasie. As gevolg van ons bevolkingsamestelling en ander probleme het die wanindruk egter oor die jare by mense in Suid-Afrika ontstaan dat net die Staat verantwoordelik is vir die voorsiening van behuising.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, kom ons kyk na die agb. Minister se probleme. Die agb. Minister <span class="col_839-840" refersTo="page_0443"/>het R256 miljoen van die agb. Minister van Finansies ontvang en ek is baie bly om van die agb. Minister te verneem dat hierdie bedrag nou opgeskuif het na R300 miljoen. Hoe hy dit reggekry het, weet ek nie, maar die feit is dat hy dit reggekry het. Verder het die agb. Minister gister aangekondig dat hy nie meer die rente hoef te betaal nie. Daar is egter ook &#x2019;n derde probleem. Intussen moes hy gebruik maak van oorbruggingskapitaal van &#x2019;n plaaslike bestuur. Daardie geld moet terugbetaal word voordat hy daaraan kan dink om geld vir nuwe behuising beskikbaar te stel. Ek dink dat dit vir die agb. Minister en die Regering &#x2019;n onmoontlike taak geword het om behuising vir die hele bevolking van Suid-Afrika te finansier. As &#x2019;n man iets reg moet maak, moet hy die gereedskap h&#x00EA;. As hy nie die gereedskap het nie, kan hy die werk nie doen nie. Die agb. Minister se gereedskap is finansies en hy het dit nie. Daarom meen ek dat ons na &#x2019;n heel nuwe strategie moet kyk sover dit behuising in Suid-Afrika betref. Ons moet kyk na &#x2019;n bre&#x00EB;r finansieringsfront en daarom is ek baie bly dat die agb. lid vir Bellville weer eens gevra het dat die Nasionale Behuisingskommissie leningsmagte moet kry. Ek wil egter verder gaan. Ons het in Suid-Afrika 522 munisipali-teite. Hierdie munisipaliteite tree almal as agente op vir die departement. Ek wil nou vra of ons nie hierdie munisipaliteite nader kan trek en in plaas daarvan dat ons hulle as agente gebruik, maak ons hulle volle ven-note in hierdie aksie om behuising vir die bevolking van Suid-Afrika te voorsien. Hierdie munisipaliteite het almal leningsmagte. Het die tyd nie aangebreek dat ons vir hierdie mense moet s&#x00EA; dat hulle van die leningsmagte moet gebruik maak nie, sodat hulle die agb. Minister kan help met hierdie probleem. Daar is sekere besware wat van die kant van die munisipaliteite geopper kan word. Hulle kan in die eerste plek s&#x00EA; dat as hulle addisionele geld op die ope mark moet gaan leen, dit hul leningsfasiliteite by die Tesourie kan raak. My antwoord daarop is dat as &#x2019;n mens spesifiek geld vir behuising leen, dit nie jou leningsplafon by die Tesourie raak nie. Hulle sal waarskynlik s&#x00EA; dat hulle ho&#x00EB;r rente op die ope mark moet betaal, maar die agb. Minister betaal in elk geval op die oomblik ho&#x00EB; rente op oorbruggingskapitaal. Ons kan selfs verder gaan en die agb. Minister kan vir plaaslike be stuur s&#x00EA; dat hulle moet voortgaan om ekonomiese behuising te voorsien en dat hulle behuising vir die subekonomiese groep asook vir die oues-van-dae aan die departement moet oorlaat.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is jammer dat die agb. lid vir Seepunt vir my hier teen die einde van die debat &#x2019;n hele rits vrae kom vra. Hy weet dat ek oor beperkte tyd beskik en dit is onbillik dat ek tyd wat ek afgesonder het om vrae van ander agb. lede te beantwoord in hierdie stadium moet gebruik om vir hom uitvoerige antwoorde te gee. Ek hoop hy sien dit in hierdie lig.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het so in die verbygang na die Bloemhof-woonstelle verwys en hy sit toe self &#x2019;n pop op wat hy dan weer afslaan. Dit is onsin wat die agb. lid praat want hy weet so goed soos ek dat daar nie sulke gerugte is soos waarvan hy praat nie. Dit is &#x2019;n pop wat hy self hier opsit. [Tussenwerpsels.] Nou ja goed. Ek dink nie die agb. lid moet dit doen nie terwyl hy beter weet nie. Die agb. lid het my daarop gewys dat ek ges&#x00EA; het dat die departement R800 miljoen nodig het om alle behuising te finansier terwyl ons maar oor R300 miljoen beskik. Ek verwys natuurlik na behuising wat deur die publieke sektor voorsien word. Dit is so dat hierdie syfers gegrond is op ons statistiek. Ons het egter oor die jare heen gevind dat dinge nie so uitwerk soos ons dit beplan nie. Al sou dit egter ook so uitwerk wil ek die agb. lid daarop wys dat ons nou in &#x2019;n mate moet doen wat daardie agb. lid en ook ander agb. lede wil h&#x00EA;. Die grootste behoefte ten opsigte van behuising en die grootste agterstand bestaan juis by behuising ten opsigte van Swart mense. Vanwe&#x00EB; die nuwe strategie en sienswyse wat aanvaar is ten opsigte van die voorsiening van behuising vir Swartes in die nasionale State en in sekere dele van Wit Suid-Afrika sal ons sover moontlik hierdie geld waaroor ons beskik moet rek en sal ons in &#x2019;n groot mate die betrokkenheid van die privaatsektor verkry. Dit sal ons berekenings dan omvergooi omdat daardie berekenings gegrond is op die situasie soos dit vandag is. Met ander woorde, ons moet hoop dat die nuwe benadering van die Departement van Samewerking en Ontwikkeling ten opsigte van behuising, veral sover dit die voorsiening <span class="col_841-842" refersTo="page_0444"/>van sekere standaarde van behuising aan Swartes betref, sal lei tot &#x2019;n toenemende betrokkenheid van die privaatsektor sodat ons minder fondse uit die owerheidsektor hoef te bestee. Daardie agb. lid het &#x2019;n voorstel gemaak wat &#x2019;n ander agb. lid&#x2014;ek meen dit was die agb. lid vir Bellville&#x2014;ook al hier gemaak het. Hy het verwys na die voor-geskrewe belegging wat sekere instansies soos pensioenfondse by die Staatskuld-kommissarisse moet maak. Het ek die agb. lid verkeerd verstaan?</p>

<p>As ek verkeerd verstaan het sal ek die agb. lid se Hansard lees en dan sal ek &#x2019;n antwoord verstrek.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag antwoord op die toespraak wat die agb. lid vir Bellville gelewer het. Hy het voorgestel dat in plaas daarvan om die voorgeskrewe belegging in sy geheel by die Staatskuldkommissarisse te bel&#x00EA;, &#x2019;n sekere bedrag ook by bougenootskappe bel&#x00EA; kan word. Dit kan ons by die Departement van Finansies aanbeveel &#x2026;</p>

<p>Ja goed, ek sal op hierdie aspek ingaan en die agb. lid later &#x2019;n antwoord stuur. Ek wil nie weer met die agb. lid oor huurbeheer praat nie. Ons is egter besig om na sekere maatre&#x00EB;ls te kyk en hoe ons uiteindelik van huurbeheer ontslae kan raak. Daarna het die agb. lid van die Groepsgebiedewet gepraat en ander agb. lede het ook oor daardie wetgewing gepraat en ek wil dus kortliks hiermee handel. Ek en die departement probeer om die Wet op Groepsgebiede met die grootste omsigtig-heid toe te pas. Dit l&#x00EA; egter ten grondslag van die Regering se beleid ten opsigte van afsonderlike woongebiede en daarom kan die wetgewing nie oorboord gegooi word nie en agb. lede moet dit begryp. Dit is maklik vir lede van die PFP wat nie met die werklik-heid saamleef nie, maar wat vir hulself apartheid koop in Rondebosch, Kenilworth, Pinelands en Houghton.</p>

<p>Ek het in die verlede ges&#x00EA; ons aanvaar dat die Groepsgebiedewet skerp kante het en dat dit &#x2019;n baie moeilike Wet is om te administreer. Agb. lede behoort met ons en die departement simpatie te h&#x00EA; dat ons hierdie taak moet uitvoer. Dit is moeilike wetgewing wat in belang van orde in Suid-Afrika uitgevoer moet word anders sal ons chaos h&#x00EA;. Hierdie Wet is die grondslag van die ordening van gemeen-skappe in Suid-Afrika en dit is die beste grondslag waarop &#x2019;n mens goeie buurskap met grense kan h&#x00EA;. As ons dit in Suid-Afrika laat vaar, skop ons die bodem onder ons <span class="col_843-844" refersTo="page_0445"/>hele geordende volksbestaan uit. Daarom kan ons van die beginsels van hierdie wet-gewing nie afsien nie. Ek het egter ges&#x00EA; dat ons ons bes doen om die wetgewing met die grootste omsigtigheid uit te voer. Ek wil h&#x00EA; dat &#x2019;n agb. lid hier moet opstaan wat van hierdie dinge weet&#x2014;en ek praat nie nou van die agb. lid vir Tuine nie&#x2014;om &#x2019;n vinger na my te wys en te vra waarom ek nie opgetree het soos ek vandag hier voorgegee het dat ek doen nie. Ek en die departement is heeltemal bereid en ook van voornemens om indringend na die wetgewing te laat kyk deur onbetrokke buitestaanders om ons ten opsigte van die nodige wysigings te adviseer. Ek herhaal dat ek en die departement bereid is&#x2014;en ons is ook van voornemens om dit te doen&#x2014;om indringend na die Wet te laat kyk deur onbetrokke buitestaanders om ons oor die nodige wysigings te adviseer. Dit is egter so dat die Presidentsraad ook met &#x2019;n ondersoek in hierdie verband besig is. Ek verkeer dus vandag in &#x2019;n baie moeilike posisie om daaroor te praat. Die agb. lid het my ander vrae gevra wat net so moeilik is om te beantwoord. Die agb. lid wil van my weet wanneer ons regulasie 70 terugtrek en wanneer ons sentrale handelsgebiede in wetgewing omskep. Die Groepsgebiedewet is &#x2019;n baie ingewikkelde stuk wetgewing en ek meen dat agb. lede wat al probeer het om dit te lees, hierdie stelling sal begryp. Ons het al wetgewing in hierdie verband voor die Kabinet gel&#x00EA;. Dit is egter so dat wanneer ons daarmee besig is daar ook ander dinge aan die gang is. Op die oomblik sal dit mos hoogs voorbarig van my wees om hier, terwyl die Presidentsraad besig is om die wetgewing te ondersoek met die oog op moontlike verandering, op my eentjie te kom en die Wet te verander. Daar moet egter volgende jaar sekere veranderings aan die Wet aangebring word&#x2014;al is dit ook interimveranderings&#x2014;om die voorstelle insake sport wat uit die ondersoek van die RGN voortgespruit het te akkommodeer en ook om die Wet in ooreenstemming met die Drankwet te bring as gevolg van veranderings wat aan laasgenoemde Wet aangebring word. Ons sal dus uiteindelik die Wet moet wysig, maar my eie departement wil ook graag die geleentheid h&#x00EA; om na sekere aspekte te kyk. Aangesien die Presidentsraad daarmee besig is, kan ek nie aan die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat ek al die wysigings wat ek moet aanbring tydens die volgende sitting van die Parlement sal kan afhandel nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil nou by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Jeppe kom. Daardie agb. lid het my &#x2019;n paar vrae gevra oor die onwettige indringing van sekere groepe in Johannesburg en as ek dit s&#x00EA;, praat ek nie van verdringing nie. Hy het my gevra wat van afsonderlike woonge-biede word en hy het my ook uitgevra omtrent Hillbrow, Jeppe en Mayfair. Dit is &#x2019;n baie moeilike probleemwaarmee ons daar te kampe het, maar dit is gelukkig beperk tot Johannesburg. Ongeveer 2 000 gevalle van ongemagtigde okkupasie het onder die departement se aandag gekom. Dit was mense wat onregmatig eiendom geokkupeer het in &#x2019;n groepsgebied wat nie vir hulle bedoel is nie.</p>

<speech by="#widman">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. B. WIDMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is 2 000 klagtes in die hele Johannesburg ontvang?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, dit was 2 000 en daar kan maklik agt tot tienduisend mense daarby betrokke wees afhangende van hoeveel in &#x2019;n wooneenheid is. Ek verwys egter na 2 000 gevalle. Daar is reeds 546 formele sake teen hierdie mense aanhangig gemaak en almal word deur Actstop beveg. Tot dusver het sowat 500 onwettige bewoners, voordat sake formeel teen hul ingestel is, hul okkupasie in die Blanke gebied be&#x00EB;indig en hul situasie gewettig. In 356 gevalle het die persone weg-getrek nadat sake teen hulle aanhangig gemaak is. In 60 gevalle is skuldigbevindings reeds verkry en in sommige gevalle is eienaars met soveel as R1 000 beboet. Tans is daar nog 190 sake op die Rol waarvan 45 in die woonbuurt Mayfair is. Ten opsigte van hierdie aangeleentheid wil ek dus vandag die volgende verklaring maak&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Soos Agbare Lede sal onthou het die onwettige indringing van sekere nie-Blanke groepe in Blanke woongebiede, veral in Johannesburg, die afgelope jaar besondere aandag ontvang. Ek en die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikke-ling het in al die omstandighede so simpatiek moontlik probeer optree ten einde te voorkom dat daar hardhandig met sulke onwettige indringers gehandel word. Hierdie onwettige indringing van Blanke woongebiede is in stryd met die Wet op Groepsgebiede en dit is in stryd met die <span class="col_845-846" refersTo="page_0446"/>Regering se beleid van afsonderlike woon-buurtes.<br/>Hierdie handelinge kan dus nie oogluikend toegelaat word nie. In die tyd van my voorganger is hofsake aanhangig gemaak wat uiteindelik gevoer is tot in die App&#x00E8;l-hof, waar beslis is dat die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling heeltemal reg opgetree het en dat die onwettige indringers uitgesit kan word sonder dat enige vorm van alternatiewe akkommodasie aan hulle beskikbaar gestel word. Desondanks het ek oor die afgelope jaar getrag om so billik en redelik moontlik op te tree, maar daar is moedswillige elevmente wat nie wil saamwerk nie, wat met behulp van Actstop die gereg uitdaag, en met wie uiteindelik gehandel sal moet word.<br/>I must emphasize that, in order to implement the judgment of the Appeal Court, the Departement has no choice but to institute legal proceedings against persons who continue to illegally occupy dwellings in White group areas, and who, in the light of past experience, moreover have no intention to co-operate with the Department.<br/>However, as legal proceedings are timeconsuming, which inevitably enables wilful persons to employ a number of delaying tactics, the Government has after careful consideration of the matter over a long period of time, come to the conclusion that it has no alternative but to place legislation before Parliament which will enable the Department to deal with illegal occupation more effectively. It is my intention to place draft legislation in this respect before Parliament early next year.<br/>This will in turn ensure that racial friction generated by illegal occupation, and which presently creates considerable problems, can be effectively dealt with at an early stage.<br/>It has also been brought to my attention that illegal occupants of flats and houses in Johannesburg are being cruelly exploited by landlords extracting excessive rentals. This intolerable practice by unscrupulous landlords cannot be condoned and, although I do not wish to unnecessarily extend rent control, I will not hesitate to place such blocks of flats or dwelling units under rent control.<br/>I trust that landlords, particularly in Johannesburg, will in their own interest take heed of this warning and ensure that illegal occupants of their properties in White group areas vacate immediately, and last, but not least, stop this unscrupulous exploitation which invariably follows.</block>

<p>Ek het destyds aan die agb. lid vir Seepunt beloof dat ek my uiterste bes sal doen om hierdie sake vreedsaam te skik op &#x2019;n mens-like manier. Ek kan vandag s&#x00EA; dat die departement uit sy pad gegaan het maar daar is &#x2019;n klompie van hierdie mense&#x2014;hoewel daar van die 500 gevalle minder as 200 oor is&#x2014; wat eenvoudig opgesweep word deur Actstop en regstudente van die Universiteit van die Witwatersrand en hulle dwing ons nou eenvoudig omdat hulle die Wet in eie hande neem. Ons sal nou met hulle moet handel. Dit spyt my, maar as ons nie samewerking kan kry nie, kan ek nie so voortgaan nie, aangesien ek ook &#x2019;n plig teenoor die Regering se beleid het. Ek het ook &#x2019;n plig teenoor Hillbrow en die Blankes van Johannesburg wat ek nie bereid is om te versaak nie.</p>

<p>Ek kom nou by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes. Hy het &#x2019;n wel-deurdagte toespraak gehou en gevra wat my houding is ten opsigte van &#x2019;n Indi&#x00EB;r-woonbuurt nader aan die middestad van Johannesburg. Hy het my ook gevra wat van Mayfair gaan word. In hierdie verband kan ek s&#x00EA; dat die aangeleentheid van residensi&#x00EB;le regte vir Indi&#x00EB;rs nader aan die middestad van Johannesburg &#x2019;n saak is waaraan ek en die departement al baie aandag gegee het. In werklikheid het ek kort nadat ek Minister geword het deur die departement die Groepsgebiederaad opdrag gegee om nieamptelik ondersoek in te stel om die feite te versamel en om aan my voorstelle in di&#x00E9; verband voor te l&#x00EA;. Ek het ongeveer drie maande gelede voorstelle van di&#x00E9; raad ontvang waarna ek met verskillende belangheb-bendes, onder andere die bestuurskomitee van die stadsraad van Johannesburg informele samesprekings gevoer het ten einde die gevoel oor sekere aspekte van die voorstelle te toets. Soos agb. lede weet, is die Presi-dentsraad besig met &#x2019;n ondersoek na die Wet op Groepsgebiede en spesifiek na Pageview, Johannesburg, en Distrik Ses in Kaapstad. <span class="col_847-848" refersTo="page_0447"/>Om di&#x00E9; rede kan ek nou niks verder oor hierdie saak s&#x00EA; nie. &#x2019;n Tussentydse verslag word egter binnekort in di&#x00E9; verband van die Presidentsraad verwag. Sodra die verslag be-skikbaar is, sal ek in staat wees om na buite standpunt in te neem oor die kwessie van residensi&#x00EB;le regte vir Indi&#x00EB;rs in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Sonder om die bevindings van die Presidentsraad vooruit te loop en om my op &#x2019;n terrein te waag wat onbehoorlik is, moet ek dit daarby laat. Die agb. lid vir Johannesburg-Wes, die agb. lid vir Langlaagte en die agb. lid vir Jeppe het spesiflek aan my gevra wat met die woonbuurtes te Mayfair, Hillbrow en Jeppe gaan gebeur. Daardie woon-buurte is Blanke woongebiede wat Blank sal bly en agb. lede moet dit begryp. Dit het niks te doen met di&#x00E9; dinge wat hier rondom ges&#x00EA; is nie.</p>

<p>Ek kom nou by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Suidkus, maar ek moet nou kortpad steek want ek het net &#x2019;n paar minute oor. Ek wil vir die agb. lid vir Suidkus s&#x00EA; dat ek &#x2019;n lang teleks gekry het oor die saak wat hy geopper het en ek het &#x2019;n mooi storie oor sy plaaslike saak. Ek was by Ifafa Beach &#x2026; Ja, agb. lede lag nou oor my Engelse uitspraak maar my Engels klink maar net soos &#x2019;n paar ander agb. lede se Afrikaans. Ek het daardie strand self laat proklameer as &#x2019;n Kleurlingstrand en ek is trots daarop dat ons departement dit gedoen het omdat dit een van die mooiste strande in daardie omge-wing is. Ek sal die besonderhede van hierdie lang teleks in briefvorm aan die agb. lid stuur en ek meen dat dit tot sy bevrediging sal wees. Dit gaan oor die belangrike saak van die 240 Kleurling-families uit die Transkei wat hulle nou in die omgewing van Port St. John bevind. Ons beskou hierdie aange-leentheid as &#x2019;n saak van baie ho&#x00EB; prioriteit.</p>

<p>Die agb. Adjunk-minister sal &#x2019;n antwoord aan die agb. lid vir Boksburg verstrek na aanleiding van dit wat hy in sy toespraak geopper het. Die kwessie van die geraassone sal ons egter weer met die betrokke ower-hede moet opneem. Baie dankie vir die mooi begrip wat die agb. lid getoon het vir ons pogings om by Reigerpark iets te doen om weer orde daar te skep.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany is not here at the moment but he was very pessimistic about the housing situation for Blacks in the Eastern Cape. It is indeed a matter for concern, but it was said in 1954 that we will never be able to wipe out the housing backlog for Blacks which was at that stage 120 000. In 1958 it was estimated that we will have to provide 179 000 housing units for Blacks during the next decade. The task was described as impossible. During the next ten years not only were 179 000 houses built, but a total of 197 000 were provided. This, Mr. Chairman, proves the fallacy of the predictions of the prophets of doom.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag vir die agb. lid vir Port Eliza-beth-Noord s&#x00EA; dat hy &#x2019;n werklike probleemhet in verband met die nywerheidsindring-ing&#x2014;en nie verdringing nie&#x2014;in die woongebied van Sidwell. Daar is &#x2019;n Staatskomitee vir Port Elizabeth wat op die aangeleentheid van Sidwell ingaan. Hierdie Staatskomitee sal eersdaags in Port Elizabeth vergader en ek versoek die Direkteur-generaal om my op die hoogte van sake te bring nadat hulle na al die aspekte gekyk het waarna die agb. lid vir Port Elizabeth-Noord verwys het. Ek hoop dat hy my sal inlig oor wat daar plaasgevind het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Greytown het so &#x2019;n bietjie los en vas gepraat maar hy het een belangrike aspek uitgelig waarna ek moet verwys. Hy het ges&#x00EA; dat die privaatsektor nie met die openbare sektor kon meeding sover dit die voorsiening van massalaekostebehuising van minimum standaarde betref nie. Die agb. lid is natuurlik reg. Die openbare sektor bou hierdie massabehuising van &#x2019;n lae standaard in groot hoeveelhede en groot kontrakte word daarvoor uitgereik. Hulle beskik oor mense met kennis en ook hul eie personeel wat kan toesig hou en hulle beskik ook oor die nodige masjinerie. Dit is dus so dat die privaatsektor nie met hulle kan meeding nie. Ek het verlede week in een van die plaaslike koerante gelees&#x2014;ek meen dit was <i>The Cape Times</i>&#x2014;dat hier iewers in ons omgewing &#x2019;n organisasie waarvan dr. Wolheim die voorsitter is vir &#x2019;n klompie plakkers wat eers op &#x2019;n kerkperseel gehuisves was, kernhuise gebou het. Daardie kernhuise vir plakkers kos hulle ongeveer R20 000 elk. Dit is nou wat ek sal beskou as &#x2019;n vermorsing van geld van die eerste water. Die agb. lid vir Greytown het my ook gevra na die Kleurling-woonbuurt daar by sy dorp. Die Groepsgebied vir Kleurlinge aldaar is reeds in April vanjaar verklaar. Ons is nou besig om &#x2019;n <span class="col_849-850" refersTo="page_0448"/>opname te maak en nadat ons vasgestel het hoeveel mense huise wil h&#x00EA;, sal ons &#x2019;n skema daar onderneem. Dit sal die Kleurlinge in Grey town bestendig.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Rustenburg het met groot oorgawe gepraat oor stadsvernuwing. Hy het ook gepraat van sosio-ekonomiese opheffing en het die bydrae van die klein belegger benadruk veral die klein belegging wat moontlik in daardie omgewing onteien is. Ons het veral sulke gevalle in Transvaal en ons het groot pi&#x00EB;teit met daardie soort gevalle. By die departement gee ons voorkeur aan daardie mense, binne die perke van die wet, wanneer dit by die ontwikkeling van daardie gebiede kom.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Brentwood het verwys na dit wat ons doen om sakegeleenthede vir die Bruin mense van Mitchellsplein daar te stel. Mitchellsplein is die trots van ons departement in hierdie verband en ek is bly dat hy daarna verwys het. Hy het die probleemvan die &#x201E;nominee&#x201D;-stelsel geopper, &#x2019;n stelsel wat ons departement en ook ander departement wat daarby betrokke is se aandag reeds vir &#x2019;n lang tyd in beslag neem, maar ons kon nog nie &#x2019;n behoorlike teenvoeter daarvoor bedink nie. Die agb. lid vra dat ons handels-geriewe vir ander kleurgroepe in hul eie woongebiede moet skep. Dit is ons beleid en ons probeer altyd vir hulle daar geleenthede skep. Die agb. lid vir Algoa het verwys na die verkoop van woonstelle onder die wetgewing insake deeltitels by Algoapark. Die konstruksie en ontwerp van daardie woonstelle is sodanig dat &#x2019;n mens dit moeilik onder deeltitels verkoop kan kry. Daar is buitendien baie ander woonstelle in Port Elizabeth in besit van my departement wat hewer onder deeltitels verkoop kan word. Ek is amper &#x2019;n bietjie huiwerig om hierdie groot blokke laehuurwoonstelle in Algoapark aan die verhuringsmark in Port Elizabeth te onttrek. Dit gee ons die geleentheid om die groot aantal mindergegoede mense te kan huisves teen &#x2019;n huur wat hulle kan bekostig. Die agb. lid het ook ander aspekte geopper waaraan ek graag te gelegener tyd my aandag sal skenk.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek my persoonlike dank betuig teenoor die departement se personeel en veral die Parlement&#x00EA;re personeel wat elke dag rondom my is en al die probleme en onsin wat ek moet opeet, maar saam met my verduur en opeet. Hulle staan my baie getrou by en ons probeer om aan elke lid wat in hierdie aangeleenthede belang stel, &#x2019;n persoonlike diens te lewer. Ek wil my persoonlike waardering betuig teenoor die Direk-teur-generaal, mnr. Fouch&#x00E9;. Hy verlaat nie die diens nie. Die ouens wat hom wegwens, sal nog heelwat met hom opgeskeep sit; en ook met my. Mnr. Fouch&#x00E9; is &#x2019;n bekwame en ervare amptenaar en sy werk word hoog waardeer deur my en almal wat behuisings-aangeleenthede in hierdie land werklik op die hart dra. Ek waardeer sy ondersteuning en sy kennis geweldig baie.</p>

<p>Ek wil aan al die agb. lede wat tot dusver aan die debat deelgeneem het, dankie s&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>In conclusion, allow me to thank all the new hon. members on both sides who for the first time took part in this debate, and especially those who will continue to take a particular interest in the matters concerning my department.</p>

<p>Vir diegene wat werklik in gemeenskaps-ontwikkeling belang stel, staan my deur, die deur van die Direkteur-generaal en di&#x00E9; van die agb. Adjunk-minister oop. Laat hulle met ons kom gesels oor hul probleme. Ons belowe hulle die beste diens. Ons word daarvoor betaal. Hulle moet net nie met onsin na ons kom nie.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sive">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. SIVE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to the hon. the Minister and I want to say at the outset that it is a pity that rationalization did not go far enough: I think that all housing matters should have fallen under this particular Minister, because he at least shows just that little bit of sympathy which others do not show.</p>

<p>However, I wish to deal with a number of directorates that now come under the auspices of the hon. the Minister of Community Development. I want to say that the importance of their functions must not be underestimated, even if they do not appear to have any political glamour.</p>

<p>I should like to deal, first of all, with the Directorate of State Auxiliary Services and specifically with the branch of accommodation and hirings. From reports received from various developers and architects it now appears as if the rentals paid by the State, particularly in the metropolitan areas, are market-related. What is disturbing, however, <span class="col_851-852" refersTo="page_0449"/>is the future with the escalations one sees taking place at the present moment in private office blocks. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how he intends to meet this. Further, what escalation per annum does he normally grant to landlords? Secondly, in view of the out-of-court settlement on the Groote Schuur Estate, what houses are being built, what will the final cost be and what are the out-of-court settlement costs?</p>

<p>Next I should like to deal with the Government Printing Works. I should like to congratulate the Government Printer on the efficient management of this department. Each hon. member of the House should pay him tribute because the vast number of papers, Bills, reports, Acts and documents are available only because of the efficiency of the Government Printer. However, I feel that consideration should be given to the feasability of opening a small branch office in the Johannesburg business area where the Government Printer&#x2019;s publications, maps, etc., can be freely purchased.</p>

<p>I should like to deal now with the Surveys and Mapping Branch. One can do little else but compliment this branch on the excellence of South African maps. Without our beacon system and excellent maps, for example, no land transaction, no delimitation of Parliamentary constituencies, no road or rail construction and no air flights could be undertaken with such accuracy. I trust that there is close co-ordination between this branch and Defence, as it is essential to have good maps for the effective conduct of operations. This branch performed a service of incalculable worth in the field of battle in World War II, and I should belatedly like to commend this branch for that. This applies particularly to the South African surveyors.</p>

<p>As far as the Deeds Branch is concerned, our system of deeds registration without doubt gives owners certainty of title, and this system is probably as good as, if not better than, any other system in the world. The hon. the Deputy Minister has drawn attention to the tremendous burden which was imposed on the Deeds Branch during the boom. However, it is with regret that one notes that the report shows a considerable loss of staff to the private sector. What is more disturbing, however, is the small number of new staff members qualifying in their examinations. Is this because the school standard of new recruits is too low, or are low salaries responsible for attracting such weak staff?</p>

<p>I now wish to turn to the Directorate of Land Affairs and Deeds. Time does not allow a full discussion on acquisitions. According to the report for 1979-&#x2019;80 land was acquired for the expansion of the Groot Constantia Estate. The buildings on that estate have been declared historical monuments. Cannot the whole estate be restored as an original historical farm? Alternatively, was this land purchased for the prestige Coloured township? I direct that question to the hon. the Minister. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister acceded to the request for the establishment of an Indian residential township in Sandton. This township is at present being serviced and I am sure that both Sandton and the hon. the Minister are going to be justly proud of it. I helped to have it established and I am pleased the Minister agreed with it.</p>

<p>I should next like to refer to the settlement of disputes concerning compensation. I do not wish to repeat the payments in regard to the Theewaterskloof Dam, but they do highlight the necessity for the formation of a professional valuators&#x2019; board under which State, provincial, municipal and private valuators will be registered after qualifications and examination standards have been laid down. All ratable property in the whole of South Africa has to be valued every few years, and a heavy responsibility rests on municipal valuators because property taxes are based thereon. With regard to the data bank the hon. the Minister mentioned last night, may I please recommend to the hon. the Deputy Minister that this be regionalized rather than centralized, as knowledge of local conditions is most important. It was mentioned with regard to valuations and the appointment of valuators last night. As I say, I think it is important that this be regionalized rather than that there should be a central bank in Pretoria where it will be lost.</p>

<p>In regard to the 29 sites on the Foreshore in Cape Town, I should like to ask whether rates are being paid on them to the Cape Town Municipality. I should also like to ask why almost 100 000 hectares were bought for the rural Coloured area in Namaqualand. I visited the area, which lies north of Springbok, <span class="col_853-854" refersTo="page_0450"/>and am perturbed at the abject poverty of that particular area. What sort of housing scheme does the hon. the Minister propose to bring to that particular area?</p>

<p>I should now like to deal with the general policy with regard to the disposal of State land. This has always been done by tender or public auction. However, in the past it was possible to arrange for obtaining State land on an exchange basis, but subject to valuation. Normally, the buyer involved in an exchange could obtain this land only if, in addition to the land offered, he paid a certain amount in cash. What is the situation today with regard to the possible reintroduction of exchanges?</p>

<p>Lastly, I should like to deal with a few points with regard to the Directorate of Building Services. I wish to refer briefly to the supervision of contractors on building sites and the application of the BIAC (Haylett) formula. I am a bit worried about the actual supervision of building operations and the issuing of certificates. I have no proof in this regard, but I am very perturbed about the situation. I wonder whether private quantity surveyors should not be used to a greater extent to ensure proper supervision over State contracts. As far as the BIAC (Haylett) formula is concerned, I am informed that it is not a good system and that it does lead to over-compensation. I believe that the Brett Committee and the Institute of Quantity Surveyors&#x2014;I did not even tell the hon. member for Sea Point I would mention this&#x2014;should get together finally to provide a satisfactory system.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to deal with something much nearer my heart. It concerns the Army. When I visited the No. 1 Military Hospital at Voortrekkerhoogte, I was appalled to discover how long it had taken to erect this particular building. When I went there, I saw all sorts of things that were wrong. Changes were having to be made and mistakes seemed innumerable. The old hospital has served South African soldiers well for two world wars and more. With a view to our defence programme on the border, it is even more important that this hospital be completed without delay. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to investigate this matter personally, take it under his wing and see that it is completed as soon as possible for the sake of our children who serve this country.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, wat die Milit&#x00EA;re Hospitaal betref, dink ek dat die tydsverloop nie die departement ten laste gel&#x00EA; kan word nie. Ek dink die departement doen sy bes om daardie hospitaal voltooi te kry. Daar is ander probleme daarmee verbonde wat miskien nie nou hier aangestip behoort te word nie. Dit het betrekking op die private kontrakteurs en ek glo nie dit is billik om hul name te noem nie.</p>

<p>Waar ons by die einde kom van die bespreking van hierdie Begrotingspos, is &#x2019;n mens ge&#x00EF;mponeer deur die geweldige bre&#x00EB; veld wat deur die departement gedek word. Die omvang van die departement imponeer &#x2019;n mens. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens na die besonder-hede in die Begroting van die Uitgawes onder hierdie begrotingspos kyk, sien jy dat dit tot 50 bladsye beslaan. &#x2019;n Mens let ook op dat daar 16 000 werknemers in die departement is. Dit is dus &#x2019;n groot departement en dit word so goed hanteer ook omdat die agb. Minister en die agb. Adjunk-minister met entoesiasme en vuur hierdie aangeleenthede behartig. Ons het gesien hoe entoesiasties die agb. Minister oor hierdie departement is. Dit is miskien belangrik om net te kyk na wat die definisie van &#x201E;gemeenskapsbou&#x201D; is. Wat is gemeenskapsbou as sodanig? Dit is nie iets wat eensklaps afgehandel word nie, maar dit is &#x201E;&#x2019;n proses waardeur daar in menslike behoeftes voorsien word vir sover dit gaan om behuising, gemeenskapsfasiliteite en alle ander geriewe wat vir volwaardige, gebalanseerde gesins-en gemeenskaps-lewe onontbeerlik is&#x201D; en in die volvoering waarvan die Staat en andere werksaam is.</p>

<p>Ons almal het gepraat oor die noodsaak-likheid van meer fondse. Ek wil graag die vraag stel of die fondse wat toegeken is, funksioneel bestee word. Hoe goed word in werklikheid die fondse bestee wat hier bewillig word? Wanneer ons na die Begroting van die Uitgawes kyk, merk ons op dat die fondse onder vier hoofindelings toegeken word. Die totale bedrag wat aan hierdie departement toeges&#x00EA; is, beloop R818 miljoen. Dit is slegs 5,2&#x0025; van die totale begroting, <span class="col_855-856" refersTo="page_0451"/>en 22&#x0025; van hierdie bedrag word aangewend op die gebied van die voorsiening van behuising en gemeenskapsontwikkeling. Ek verwys nou na programme 2 en 3. Van die totale bedrag word 71&#x0025; met betrekking tot Deel III, &#x201E;Owerheidshulpdienste&#x201D;, aangewend. Dit beslaan programme 4 tot 8. As ons na program 2 kyk, sien ons dat die bedrag vir die voorsiening van behuising slegs 16&#x0025; uitmaak van die totale bedrag wat onder hierdie Begrotingspos bewillig word. As ons na die totale begroting vir al die departemente kyk, sien ons dat slegs 0,86&#x0025; daarvan aan behuising bestee word. Ek dink almal sal saamstem dat in vergelyking met die totale begroting, dit &#x2019;n baie geringe bedrag is.</p>

<p>Ek wil agb. lede verwys na bladsy 23-8 van die Begroting van die Uitgawes. Dit gee besonderhede oor die byvoeging tot kapitaal van die Nasionale Behuisingsfonds wat onder program 2 val. Ons sien daar dat die byvoeging ten opsigte van Blankes met R2 miljoen afgeneem het. In die geval van die Asi&#x00EB;rs het die byvoeging met R7 miljoen toegeneem, in die geval van die Kleurlinge met R14 miljoen, en in die geval van die Swartes met R5 miljoen. &#x2019;n Mens moet ook in ag neem dat die voorsiening van behuising vir anderskleuriges nie net onder hierdie Begrotingspos gedek word nie, maar dat ander Begrotingsposte ook daarin voorsien. Hieruit word dit vir &#x2019;n mens baie duidelik dat die private sektor besondere aandag sal moet skenk aan die voorsiening van behuising vir Blankes in die lae-en middelinkom-stegroepe. Dit blyk duidelik hieruit.</p>

<p>Nou wil ek graag teruggaan na Deel III van die Begrotingspos en spesifiek na program 4, &#x201E;Akkommodasie en Strukture&#x201D;. Die bewilliging ten opsigte van program 4 maak 59&#x0025; van die totale bedrag uit. Nou is die vraag of hierdie groot bedrag werklik effektief aangewend word. U sal oplet, Meneer, dat dit &#x2019;n kolom 2-item is hierdie. Dit wil s&#x00EA; dat hierdie geld nie vir enigiets anders gebruik kan word nie, maar spesifiek vir hierdie doel aangewend moet word. Omdat dit so &#x2019;n groot hap van die totale bedrag is, wil ek so &#x2019;n bietjie daarby stilstaan. As ons na bladsy 23-16 kyk, sien ons dat &#x2019;n groot deel van hierdie bedrag in werk-likheid aangewend word vir die verbetering van diensvoorwaardes, byvoorbeeld verlof-gratifikasies. &#x2019;n Groot deel hiervan gaan dus aan die amptenare van die departement. Daaraan kan die departement niks doen nie &#x2014;daar moet &#x2019;n verhoging kom. Voorts kan ons kyk na die huur en belasting wat betaal moet word. As ons na bladsy 23-20 kyk, sien ons dat daar in di&#x00E9; opsig &#x2019;n toevoeging van R11 miljoen is. Ons merk op dat die departement niks aan die verhoogde bedrag ten opsigte hiervan kan doen nie. Dit is vaste uitgawes waaraan niks gedoen kan word nie. Ek wil veral ook verwys na hoofindeling M op bladsy 23-21. Dit is die hoofindeling wat betrekking het op akkommodasie, strukture en ingenieursdienste. Ons let op dat prim&#x00EA;re en sekond&#x00EA;re skole vir Kleurlinge &#x2019;n geweldige hap van die bedrag onder hierdie hoofindeling neem. Ons merk ook op dat daar onder hoofindeling M &#x2019;n verhoging van R62 miljoen is. Die punt wat ek wil maak is, dat dit alles vaste koste is waaraan die departement absoluut niks kan doen nie. In di&#x00E9; opsig is dit opmerklik hoe effektief die departement is. Ons sien hoe effektief die departement sy geld bestee, want daar is geweldige vaste koste waaraan daar niks gedoen kan word nie.</p>

<p>Om op &#x2019;n tweede aspek te wys wat op die effektiwiteit van die departement dui, wil ek my aansluit by die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout waar hy na die Staatsdrukker verwys het. Dit is baie interessant om na die syfers met betrekking tot die Staatsdrukker te kyk. Ek wil agb. lede verwys na bladsy 23-48. Daar sien ons dat die totale koste van die bedryfsrekening R46 miljoen beloop. Die tekort wat bewillig moet word, beloop egter slegs R1 000. Dit staan gelyk aan 0,002&#x0025;. Dit gee &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n indruk van die effektiewe beheer wat daar ook by die Staatsdrukkery is.</p>

<p>Op die gebied van die voorsiening van behuising wil ek verwys na bladsy 4 van die Verslag van die Direkteur-generaal van Gemeenskapsbou. Op daardie bladsy verskyn daar &#x2019;n tabel en daarin sien ons dat daar in 1975 R78 miljoen bestee is aan ongeveer 5 000 huise. In 1980 is daar omtrent dieselfde bedrag bestee&#x2014;eintlik minder&#x2014;en is daar meer huise gebou, te wete 5 800 huise. Dit beteken dat die departement in sy bouprogram meer effektief gewerk het omdat dit meer huise gebou het vir minder geld na &#x2019;n periode van vyf jaar. Dit is nou ten spyte van die eskalasie van koste. As &#x2019;n mens na die gegewens met betrekking tot <span class="col_857-858" refersTo="page_0452"/>Kleurlingbehuising kyk, kan &#x2019;n mens die afleiding maak dat die standaard van die behuising vir Kleurlinge geweldig verhoog is.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Mens kom dus na aanleiding van die aspekte wat ek uitgewys het, tot die gevolgtrekking dat die departement die fondse aan hom toegewys, absoluut effektief aanwend. Wanneer ons dus &#x2019;n oplossing soek vir die probleemvan die verskaffing van meer behuising, wil ek aan die hand doen dat daar net drie terreine is waarna &#x2019;n mens in di&#x00E9; verband moet gaan kyk. Jy hoef nie te kyk na die besteding van die departement nie. Die eerste terrein is dat daar meer geld be-skikbaar gestel sal moet word. Dit is &#x2019;n eenvoudige slotsom. Tweedens sal die private sektor op hierdie gebied al meer sy plig moet nakom, veral ook op die gebied van Blanke behuising. Derdens sal ons ons prioriteite moet regstel. Die agb. Minister het dit baie mooi gestel. Elkeen sal moet besef dat, net soos kos en klere prim&#x00EA;re behoeftes is, behuising dit ook is. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Ek dank die agb. Sweep oorkant. Ek het ges&#x00EA; dat gemeen-skapsbou &#x2019;n proses van die voorsiening van behuising is. Dit word effektief gedoen, maar iets waarna ons nader sal moet kyk, is die feit dat die departement die infrastruk-tuur skep om behuising te kan voorsien. Ek wil my graag aansluit by die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout waar hy daarna verwys het dat die departement die infrastruktuur moet skep om behuising te kan voorsien.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek stilstaan by die Direktoraat van Grondsake en Aktes. Daar moet &#x2019;n infrastruktuur geskep word om behuising te kan voorsien en dit is &#x2019;n groot en belangrike taak wat onder meer deur hierdie direktoraat effektief hanteer word. Die eerste oor-weging in di&#x00E9; verband is die verkryging van grond om gemeenskappe te kan ontwikkel en die infrastruktuur vir gemeenskappe te kan voorsien. Dit word verkry deur kontrakte aan te gaan en deur onteiening. Hier het ons te make&#x2014;en ek wil kort gaan daar-oor&#x2014;met die waardasieberoep. As die waardasie behoorlik gedoen word, kan die koste van die aankoop van grond verlaag word sodat weer eens meer huise voorsien sal kan word. In daardie opsig is dit korrek dat die waardasieberoep georden sal moet word, want dit speel &#x2019;n effektiewe rol in die koste van behuising. Die agb. lid het in di&#x00E9; verband ook na die databank verwys. Ek wil s&#x00EA; dat dit goed sal wees as daar &#x2019;n sentrale rekenaar is. Daar kan ook streeksterminale wees waar die betrokke inligting getap kan word.</p>

<p>Die tweede aspek waarop ek wil wys ten opsigte van die proses van die ontwikkeling van &#x2019;n gemeenskap is die beplanningsaspek. Daar moet stadsbeplanning plaasvind. Dit hou in beplanning, herbeplanning en stads-vemuwing. Die belangrikheid van beplanning kan &#x2019;n mens nie oorskat nie want daar kan in swak beplanning baie verskuilde koste wees. Wat is beplanning in werklik-heid? Dit is die geko&#x00F6;rdineerde en harmonieuse ontwikkeling van gemeenskappe met behoorlike inagneming van die genots-vlak van so &#x2019;n gemeenskap en van gesond-heidsfaktore, ekonomiese faktore en alles wat met die beplanning van &#x2019;n gemeenskap te doen het. &#x2019;n Belangrike aspek van beplanning is ook dat daar norme bepaal sal word ten opsigte van byvoorbeeld hoeveel parke daar aangebring moet word, en hoe wyd die strate moet wees. Ek het nog nooit norme raakgeloop oor hoeveel behuising voorsien moet word vir oues van dae wanneer daar &#x2019;n dorp uitgel&#x00EA; word nie&#x2014;en ek het heelwat agtergrondskennis in hierdie verband. Dit is miskien belangrik dat die departement dit op hom sal neem om oor &#x2019;n wye spektrum norme in di&#x00E9; verband te bepaal. Daar bestaan byvoorbeeld nie &#x2019;n norm ten opsigte van behuisingbehoeftes van oues van dae nie. Dieselfde geld ook vir jong mense. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n dorp ontwikkel, hoeveel behuising moet daar vir ons jong mense voorsien word? Waar ons universiteite nou vierjarige kursusse aanbied wat in die toekenning van &#x2019;n <i>Baccalaureus-graad</i> in beplanning uitloop, glo ek dat die departement met vrug leiding kan gee om hierdie professie, as ek dit so mag stel, verder te orden sodat behoorlike norme neergel&#x00EA; kan word. Die beplanning van &#x2019;n dorp, &#x2019;n stad of &#x2019;n streek behels die beplanning van &#x2019;n organisme. &#x2019;n Mens moet dit nie as &#x2019;n afsonderlike dorpie sien nie, maar as &#x2019;n lewende organisme. Dit moet ons in aanmerking neem.</p>

<p>Dan wil ek verwys na die Tak Opmeting <span class="col_859-860" refersTo="page_0453"/>en Kartering. Dit is my eerste liefde hierdie. Ek wil graag so &#x2019;n bietjie meer daaroor vertel. Wanneer dit kom by geodesie, het ons te make met die wiskunde van die aardbol, &#x2019;n bol wat platgedruk is. Nou moet die gege-wens op &#x2019;n plat stuk papier aangebring word. As &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n stuk papier om jou hand draai, kan jy dit nie doen sonder dat die papier kreukel nie. Daar kom dus distorsies voor wanneer &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n bal op &#x2019;n stuk plat papier wil voorstel. Daar is baie ingewikkelde wiskundige formules om die nodige regstellings te doen. Laat my net s&#x00EA; dat ons in Suid-Afrika een van die beste sisteme het in hierdie verband. Laat ek agb. lede &#x2019;n idee daarvan gee. Die hoogte van Mount Everest in die Himalaja was baie onseker. Elkeen wat dit gemeet het, het &#x2019;n ander syfer verstrek. Die probleemwas dat hulle nie die seevlak onder die berge kon bepaal nie. Dit is maklik om te bepaal waar die top is, maar hoe bepaal &#x2019;n mens die seevlak onder die berge waar daar gravitasie-afwykings is wat probleme skep? Dit is &#x2019;n ingewikkelde saak en dit is van belang ook byvoorbeeld by die uitl&#x00EA; van kanale in besproeiingskemas. Geografiese opmetings word aan die hand van fotogrammetriese opmetings gedoen. Die beginsel is eenvoudig. &#x2019;n Mens het twee foto&#x2019;s wat &#x2019;n bietjie van mekaar verskil en wanneer &#x2019;n mens na hulle kyk, kry jy &#x2019;n driedimensionale beeld wat jy dan gebruik. Dit word ook op die gebied van die medisyne gebruik. Dan is daar die kadaster, en die kadastrale landmeting. Dit is hier waar dit gaan oor die afmeting van erwe. Die landmeter moet &#x2019;n kaart teken wat wetlik erken sal word. Dit is die kadastrale opmeting. Dit is nie eintlik die moeilikste opmeting wat daar is nie. Voordat &#x2019;n dorp ontwikkel word, moet dit uitgemeet word. Dit is &#x2019;n baie belangrike aspek.</p>

<p>Vierdens kom die ingenieurs by. Wanneer &#x2019;n dorp uitgel&#x00EA; word, moet die waterretiku-lasie, die elektriese retikulasie, ens., beplan word. Wanneer daar met die bouwerk begin word, het &#x2019;n mens argitekte, bourekenaars en meganiese, ingenieurs nodig. Daarom is dit goed dat die betrokke wette deur hierdie departement geadministreer word.</p>

<p>Wanneer dit by die goedkeuring van &#x2019;n dorp kom, het ek &#x2019;n probleem. Die goedkeuring van dorpe moet bespoedig word, want hoe langer dit neem, hoe duurder word die erwe. Dit is &#x2019;n aspek hierdie wat ho&#x00EB; behuisingskoste ten gevolg het. Ek wil in di&#x00E9; verband voorstel dat al die departemente wat by die goedkeuring van &#x2019;n dorp betrokke is, aan die begin om &#x2019;n ronde tafel byeen moet kom om probleme te identifiseer of om hul goedkeuring te verleen. Dan kan hulle oor drie weke weer bymekaar kom om verdere probleme te bespreek. Dit veroorsaak &#x2019;n rompslomp wanneer daar tussen departemente &#x2019;n briefwisseling ontstaan en departemente met voorstelle kom wat die hele kaar-tehuis herhaaldelik omvergooi. Die Rhode-siese stelsel is baie aanbevelenswaardig. Ek wil aan die hand doen dat die agb. Minister hieraan aandag moet gee.</p>

<p>Meneer, die sesde punt waarby ons kom by die ontwikkeling van die infrastruktuur met die oog op die verskaffing van behuising, is die Aktekantoor. Dit is by die Akte-kantoor dat regte gevestig word. Daar kry die eienaar van grond &#x2019;n dokument, wat geregistreer word, wat s&#x00EA; dat hy die eienaar van &#x2019;n bepaalde stuk grond is. Wanneer &#x2019;n mens kyk na die verslag van die departement, dan besef jy hoeveel werk deur die Aktekantoor gedoen word. Ek wil nie hier in besonder-hede gaan nie, maar as &#x2019;n mens op bladsy 41 van die jaarverslag kyk, sien jy dat die werk van die Aktekantoor onder andere te doen het met transportaktes, notari&#x00EB;le servitute, huweliksvoorwaardekontrakte, deelplanne, onteienings, ensovoorts. Dit is geweldig belangrike werk, want om regsekerheid vir &#x2019;n mens te gee en regtitel vir &#x2019;n mens te verseker is seker een van die belangrikste sake in ons kapitalistiese stelsel.</p>

<p>Wanneer &#x2019;n mens na die jaarverslag van die Departement van Openbare Werke kyk, dan vind jy dat soveel as R13 miljoen aan die privaatsektor betaal word. Kontrakte word uitgegee, en konsultante, ingenieurs en argitekte word aangestel, tot &#x2019;n bedrag van by die R13 miljoen per jaar.</p>

<p>Die laaste aspek van die skepping van hierdie infrastruktuur is die voorsiening van die behuising self. Daaroor is baie gepraat, en ek gaan nie al daardie aspekte herhaal nie, maar wanneer &#x2019;n mens die hele infrastruktuur so beskou, dan besef jy dat daar weinig is waaraan verbeter kan word. Die rasionalisasie in die geval van hierdie departement was baie goed. Daar is slegs twee punte waaraan daar myns insiens aandag gegee kan word. Dit is, soos ek reeds genoem het, dat die dorpsbeplanningsprofessie <span class="col_861-862" refersTo="page_0454"/>georden moet word, en in die tweede plek, dat die stigting van dorpe bespoedig moet word. Daar is metodes waarvolgens dit gedoen kan word.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek graag die agb. Minister en die twee Adjunk-ministers gelukwens met die ems waarmee hulle hierdie portefeulje beje&#x00EB;n, met die simpatie wat hulle aan die dag l&#x00EA;, en met die feit dat hulle R44 miljoen ekstra kon kry. Dit, Meneer, is &#x2019;n groot prestasie, en ek wil daardie here gelukwens daarmee. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. W. WATTERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the major portion of this debate has been about housing, and I think the hon. the Minister can in fact be very pleased at the commendations that have been showered upon his department by the members of the official Opposition and ourselves in respect of the house building that his department has undertaken. I believe that those commendations were justified and that the hon. the Minister will doubtless get enjoyment from that, but I also hope that he will derive some benefit from the very large number of suggestions that have been made by various hon. members. It is quite obvious to me that the Minister and his department are enthusiastic and are working hard to effect remedies to a rather deplorable situation that prevails in South Africa and has done for many years, in the provision of homes. I may be called a prophet of doom, but I believe it is obvious that unless a few additional thoughts are given to possibly unorthodox methods of financing, of building and of providing homes one way or another, the birth rate will keep well ahead of the ability of the department to provide homes. Therefore it is important to ensure that every means at our disposal in South Africa is used for this aspect, which is probably one of the most important aspects of decent, civilized human living.</p>

<p>The principle enunciated by the hon. the Minister, I think, is a sound one, to the effect that in the first instance it is the duty of the person to provide his home. Thereafter private enterprise must do their share, and then the State comes in and does what it can. I think it is a fair enough principle, but it must be accepted that while it is fine in principle, in terms of the practical realities it is going to be extraordinarily difficult to persuade commerce and industry to encourage those who have had neither the money nor, perhaps, the mental ability, to provide their own homes. So the State, I am afraid, is for a long time into the foreseeable future going to have to look after certain segments of the community.</p>

<p>Well, that is as may be, but there is no question about it, the State is going to have to do this. Bearing that in mind, I do believe it is important, in their own interests as a department and in the interests of the good name and the reputation of our country, for them to be very, very cautious about moving people from even unsatisfactory accommodation unless and until they are in a position to immediately place those people somewhere else. I know that squatting is a pain and I know that nobody in a Governmental agency likes it. As I have mentioned before, I have had to contend with it elsewhere. It is better, however, to have those problems and have them observed by health officers, rather than have the contumely and contempt thrown on you by possibly very unknowledgeable people.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, this department does have other functions, as was pointed out in the machine-gun attack by the hon. major. [Interjections.] This is a department which is so popular for the good things it does, and I am sorry to have to raise issues from which it does derive a certain amount of unpopularity. One of these issues is the question of CBD&#x2019;s. I am not the first one to have mentioned this matter. The members of the official Opposition have already done so, and it has been mentioned in another context, with reference being made to White &#x201C;fronts&#x201D; looking after the financial affairs of Indians, and depriving them of their money, and so on. The point is that this question of central business districts is one that I believe must be faced up too quickly. I do not believe it is necessary to make a statement that all central business districts are to be opened, but I do sincerely believe that the Minister should give serious thought to making this a matter of, in the first instance, local option, to see whether the heavens <span class="col_863-864" refersTo="page_0455"/>really will fall if the central business districts are opened up.</p>

The point is, however, as I have said elsewhere, and as I believe other people must have said, that we are the few people who have made legislation for it. On the question of permits for businessmen to have their cinemas or their restaurants open, or to use all forms of business entrepreneurial activity, let me say this: Surely it makes sense that businessmen are not silly fools; they are not going to wreck their businesses. They are not going to have racial friction in their businesses. Let us therefore get rid of this as a Government edict. Let us get rid of it as a law. The Government will be doing itself a great service by distancing itself, and showing manifestly that they are distancing themselves, from racial discrimination. Let the Government say: &#x201C;If the businessman wants to open his business or if the owner of a theatre wants to open his theatre, that is his business. If he wants to go broke, fine.&#x201D; I believe that if the Government gets away from being personally involved in this, it can only do itself a great deal of good.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, more often I find myself in agreement with the hon. member for Umbilo. He made a very sensible speech and raised a few matters which we shall definitely ponder. I listened with very keen attention to his speech, especially when he said that there should be unorthodox methods of financing housing. I thought to myself: Well, this is my field. I shall jot this down. But then, Sir, he went immediately on to much more difficult matters which do not fall within my purview, but within the purview of the Minister. The Minister will be able to reply to those aspects much more ably than I can. There was, for instance, the very difficult question of the CBDs. That is a vexed probleem. We do not want to do anything that is disruptive, but I know that the Government is committed. It has accepted the Riekert Report on CBDs. As an interim measure we are introducing section 19 areas on a very large scale in our bigger cities. Before we venture into the field of the CBDs we want to see how these section 19 areas work. From the reports we are receiving, they are working excellently.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of permits. That is another matter we are looking into, but this also falls within the purview of the Minister. In his wisdom, he has given me more work than I think he has, but he has accepted for himself the more difficult matters, such as the issuing of permits, and I am very pleased with that.</p>

<p>My time is very limited, but I shall attempt to come to the points raised by other hon. members.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wou die bre&#x00EB; omvang van ons werksaamhede beskryf het, maar die tyd gaan my nie toelaat om dit te doen nie. Ek wil egter vir u s&#x00EA; dat ons werksaamhede oor die lengte en die breedte van ons land strek, en ek is teleurgesteld dat meer agb. lede nie verwys het na hierdie Witskrif, wat ons met groot moeite opgestel het nie.</p>

<p>Ja, die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout het daarna verwys. Daarin sal agb. lede &#x2019;n beeld kry van die omvang van ons werksaamhede oor die volgende vyf jaar in ons stede en tot in die <span class="col_865-866" refersTo="page_0456"/>kleinste gehuggies oor die lengte en die breedte van Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>In fact, Sir, not only our country, but the world is our parish. We have provided accommodation for our missions in foreign countries. In the island bases and far-away Antarctica our presence is felt. Mr. Chairman, if time permitted, I would have liked to refer in very glowing terms to the dedication of our loyal officials. The Minister did so at the end of his speech and before my time runs out, I want to do so as well. I should like to pay tribute to our officials, 16 000 of them. 11 000 of them have come over from the old Department of Public Works, and I am referring here to all of them, from the humblest labourer to the highest trained technicians and professional staff. When we enjoy all the amenities in this fine country, including this imposing building, with its old-world charm, in which we are now meeting, as well as those in the far-flung corners of our country, we must think of these people. I was in Namaqualand this weekend and I was proud, when travelling through the small hamlets and Coloured towns there, to see the schools which this department had built. When enjoying all these amenities, spare a thought for these dedicated officials who, through their labour, have enriched our lives. I have been in this position now for almost a year, and if I am asked&#x2014;as I often am&#x2014;what my overriding impression of this past year has been, I can say without hesitation it is the dedication of the officials of this department. I thank my Maker that I have been privileged during this past year to be associated with men and women of this calibre. They have inspired me, Sir. They have taught me the meaning of <i>esprit de corps</i> and team work. They have displayed to me that life can be meaningful and that the almost impossible can be achieved when you are motivated to work for a cause beyond yourself. I wish I had the time to cite examples. There are so many that come to mind.</p>

<p>Aan hierdie amptenare&#x2014;beter kan daar nie wees nie&#x2014;&#x2019;n dankie wat baie groter is as wat ek ooit in woorde kan uitdruk.</p>

<p>Omdat my tyd geweldig beperk is, gaan ek nie by my eintlike toespraak kom nie, en dus gaan ek net baie kortliks antwoord op die verskillende sake wat deur agb. lede geopper is. In die eerste plek wil ek verwys na die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Boksburg, wat ongelukkig nie hier is nie. Hy het &#x2019;n briefie aan my geskryf waarin hy om verskoning gevra het. Hy het gepraat oor onbenutte, le&#x00EB; erwe by ons plaaslike owerhede. Ek wil dadelik s&#x00EA; dat dit nie die Staat se beleid is om ligtelik afstand te doen van enige beskikbare grond nie, daar dat dit dikwels gebeur dat hy later weer ten duurste ander erwe moet koop, as hy sy erwe verkoop het. Hierdie grond wat ons het, word verkry met die skepping van nuwe dorpsgebiede, wanneer daar normaalweg sekere erwe gereserveer word vir die behoeftes van die Staat. Dan gebeur dit ook dat deur middel van ons Gemeenskapsontwikkelingsraad, ons met ons stadshernuwingsprojekte heelwat persele bekom. Tog, nieteenstaande die algemene beleid, is daar geen rede waarom die departement moet vasklou aan erwe wat weens hul ligging en &#x2019;n klemverskuiwing in ontwikkeling oor die jare nie meer vir enige Staatsdoeleindes nodig is nie, en daardie erwe nie van die hand moet sit nie. Indien enige plaaslike owerheid of ook die privaatsektor in sulke erwe belang stel, moet hulle maar net met die departement skakel. Ons sal dan kyk of daardie erwe benodig word vir enige Staatsdepartement. As dit nie benodig word nie, sal ons dit van die hand sit. Dit is soms tot ons voordeel om daardie erwe van die hand te sit wanneer ons dit nie self benodig nie. Daar is sekere projekte wat ons spesifiek finansier uit die opbrengs van die verkoop van hierdie erwe. Dan is dit ook tot geweldige voordeel van die plaaslike owerhede, want dit verhoog hul belastingsbasis. As ons die plaaslike owerhede kan help, soos die Minister van Finansies ook in die afgelope begroting gedoen het, dan doen ons dit graag.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Umbilo said, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout launched a machine-gun attack on us.</p>

<p>Meneer, &#x2019;n verstandige man het meer vrae gestel as wat &#x2019;n dwaas kan antwoord. Eintlik is die spreekwoord andersom, Meneer, maar ek gaan baie vriendelik teenoor die agb. lid wees want ek hou van hom. Hy is &#x2019;n besonder aangename man wat al baie goeie bydraes gelewer het.</p>

<p><span class="col_867-868" refersTo="page_0457"/>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout referred to rentals. He will have seen from our estimates that we are expending an amount of R67 million per annum on rentals. I think it was the hon. member for Yeoville who once accused us of not having money for housing because we were spending all our money on luxury office blocks. That is simply not true. Here in Plein Street we are building a luxury office block, but that is one of the only ones in the country. We are renting accommodation, and these rentals are negotiated over the long term.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the deeds registry and the low qualifications of some of the officials there. The reason is simply that due to the shortage of officials, these people have been working overtime and have consequently simply not had the time to study. Our civil servants are working many hours overtime, but nowhere is the situation worse than in the Deeds Office. The position has, however, vastly improved over the last few months, and there is no backlog either.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. Whip. The hon. member for Pretoria West also spoke of the Surveyor-General&#x2019;s office, and he spoke with great knowledge.</p>

<p>Ek het &#x2019;n tyd gelede &#x2019;n toespraak hieroor moes maak, en ek moes die woordeboek gebruik om agter te kom wat al hierdie woorde beteken&#x2014;dit was absoluut bo my bevatlikheid gewees. Meneer, dit is bekend dat die agb. lid vir Pretoria-Wes verlede jaar, by al sy ander kwalifikasies, &#x2019;n meestersgraad in stadsbeplanning behaal het. Hy is &#x2019;n persoon wat uitnemend toegerus is. Hy is &#x2019;n advokaat en &#x2019;n landmeter, en ek verstaan hy het selfs teologiese studies in sy jonger jare geneem. Ek wil &#x2019;n uitnodiging tot die agb. lid vir Pretoria-Wes, die agb. lid vir Bezuidenhout en ander agb. lede wat belang stel, rig, om een van die dae na Mowbray te gaan om te kyk na die gesofistikeerde toerusting wat ons daar het.</p>

<p>One of the many matters the hon. member for Bezuidenhout raised, was the question of valuers. A new Bill is to be introduced in 1982 in this connection. There was full agreement on this; consensus was reached between the various institutes of valuers. The hon. member also referred to the supervision of State contracts. I can say to the hon. member that we have the professional and technical staff to supervise these buildings. A lack of staff has of course had a detrimental effect, but we were fortunate enough not to have wasted money, as he thought would have happened because of the shortage of staff. Our staff simply worked longer hours.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the houses at Groote Schuur. The reply is that three of the houses for Deputy Ministers are being erected at Groote Schuur. Originally six were to be erected but, as he knows, three have been demolished. The total cost is estimated to be R820 000 for the six houses, which includes the cost of three houses to be built elsewhere. There has been an escalation in the cost. Our original estimate was R780 000. He also asked me what the court costs were in this case. This was a private settlement. If his colleague, the hon. member for Groote Schuur, will tell him, he is welcome to ask him, but I cannot divulge that.</p>

<p>Die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Pretoria-Wes is een wat ek beslis gaan nalees sodat ons daarop kan antwoord. Dit was &#x2019;n toespraak waarin die agb. lid vir ons definisies gegee het. Die agb. lid het vir ons &#x2019;n definisie van gemeenskapsontwikkeling en van <span class="col_869-870" refersTo="page_0458"/>beplanning gegee. Dit was pragtige definisies, wat ek weer gaan bestudeer. Meneer, ons dorpsbeplanners en ons konsultante is opgelei. Ons het toegeruste mense, en as hulle dorpe beplan, hou hulle wel deeglik rekening met al hierdie fasette. Aspekte soos die verwagte samestelling van die bevolking, die aantal kinders, ensovoorts, word in aanmerking geneem. Hulle het norme met betrekking tot die aantal huisgesinne per laerskool en per ho&#x00EB;rskool, die behoefte aan tehuise vir bejaardes, ensovoorts. Ek kan nou nie aan die agb. lid uit die vuis uit s&#x00EA; of daar norme is met betrekking tot hoeveel ouetehuise daar moet wees nie, maar ek weet daar is wel norme ten opsigte van parke, skole, sakesentrums, ensovoorts. Ek kan hom egter nie antwoord op die vraag of daar norme is wat betref ouetehuise nie. Al hierdie sake word egter in aanmerking geneem, en ons is trots op die feit dat ons baie deeglik toegeruste beplanners het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook gepraat van dorpstigting. Die Minister het daarop geantwoord. Ek kan net s&#x00EA; dat in Pretoria, waar die agb. lid vandaan kom en waar daar lang vertragings met dorpstigting was, daar &#x2019;n uitdrukking was dat jy nie &#x2019;n dorp stig nie, maar dat jy dorpstigting pleeg, as gevolg van die geweldige vertraging daar. Dinge het egter verander. Die agb. lid is bewus daarvan dat die Wet gewysig is en dat net skere instansies, amptelike instansies en andere wat goedgekeur word deur die Administrateur, dorpe kan stig. Daar is &#x2019;n handleiding wat deur die Administrasie uitgegee word vir toekomstige dorpstigting. Die posisie het aansienlik verbeter en, soos die Minister net-nou ges&#x00EA; het, word dorpe reeds binne &#x2019;n jaar gestig.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit was aangenaam om op hierdie punte te kon antwoord. Ek wens daar was meer tyd gewees. Ek wil baie dankie s&#x00EA; vir die ondersteuning en vir die baie hartlike gees waarin hierdie debat gevoer is.</p>

<p>Begrotingspos goedgekeur.</p>
