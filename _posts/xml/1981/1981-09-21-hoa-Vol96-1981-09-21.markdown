<speech by="#pitman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. A. PITMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I claim the privilege of the half-hour?</p>

<p>In view of the number of speakers that we have on this side of the House who want to take part in this debate I will, although I have claimed the privilege of the half-hour, only deal very briefly with some matters and not at very great length.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the most serious difficulty which the hon. the Minister faces, judging from the report of the department, is the unsatisfactory staff position in the department and the fact that, as the report states, this position is still deteriorating. The report points out that the department is losing experienced staff who are being replaced by in-experienced staff and that a heavy burden is falling on the already overloaded senior staff. In the engineering ranks, even taking into account the number of bursaries awarded, those who will be available for appointment will, as the report states, &#x201C;by no means improve the position&#x201D;. In the case of technicians, last year less than a quarter of the posts were in fact filled by trained technicians. In this regard the report states that &#x201C;drastic steps to improve salaries will have to be taken before it is too late&#x201D;. In the general divisions the department expects that greater use will have to be made of people who are not White.</p>

<p>All this is very disturbing as, first of all, South Africa is a country with limited water resources and, secondly, the timber requirements of South Africa and indeed of the whole Western World, will probably considerably exceed supply in the future. It seems to us that there are two absolutely necessary steps which the hon. the Minister will have to take. These steps are, firstly, to ensure somehow or other that salary structures in the department are fundamentally revised, and, secondly, to ensure that there is far greater recruitment of people who are not White, particularly for the general divisions.</p>

<p>The second report to which I wish to refer briefly is that of the Advocate-General which was tabled last week. That report deals with a complaint of irregularities in certain State forests in the Southern Transvaal forestry region. In summary the Advocate-General found that a forester had over a considerable period of time committed certain offences such as theft, fraud and forgery, causing loss of several thousands of rand to the department. The Advocate-General made certain recommendations. These are that effective control over stock, overtime work and State equipment must be exercised and that farming by officials near State forests should be discouraged. I merely wish to say that I hope the hon. the Minister will take effective steps in this regard. The person concerned has unfortunately passed away. Therefore, clearly no steps can be taken against him. I also wish to express the satisfaction of this side of the House with the co-operation given by the department in the investigation by the Advocate-General.</p>

<p>I have also read with care the Annual Report of the Water Research Commission instituted under Act No. 34 of 1971, and it is with one of the functions of the Water Research Commission that I should now like to deal. One of the duties of the Water Research Commission and on which it has reported this year, is the investigation and monitoring of the use of the sea as a means for the disposal of, firstly, waste matter and, secondly, sludge in the sea. That report deals with the disposal of sludge in the sea and, in particular, it mentions the new project in Durban. This project is one which has caused a great deal of concern in Natal because the coast of Natal is a very important part of that province. The hon. the Minister will be aware of mass petitions and mass meetings which have occurred in that province in regard to this matter. Not only is the Natal coast the holiday playground of South Africa, but it is also heavily populated with residential areas and industrial areas. The hon. the Minister in reply to a question in the House of Assembly this session said that 14 local authorities in total in South <span class="col_873-874" refersTo="page_0464"/>Africa disposed of waste matter into the sea and of those seven, i.e. one half, are on the Natal coast, within a comparatively short distance of one another, namely between Ballitoville just north of Durban, to Ramsgate. A spokesman for the Department of Water Affairs, Dr. T. Robbrdeck, was reported in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 23 August 1981 as having said at a symposium on the Richards Bay pipeline, in particular, and marine outfalls, in general, that there were already in Natal 16 outfalls discharging domestic sewage into the sea off the Natal coast plus five industrial waste-water pipelines off the province&#x2019;s shores. He went on to point out that the sea had &#x201C;enormous capacity&#x201D; to absorb and break down waste products but he added that there was, of course, a conflict between the interests of industrial development on the one hand and the interests of environmental protection on the other hand. He said that it was essential that a healthy balance be struck between these two demands. Speaking for myself and, I believe, for my party, I personally accept that view, namely that a healthy balance must be struck, but, with respect, that means that the precise effects of marine outfalls on the environment must be made known, not only to local authorities, but also to the public. One cannot assess whether a balance has been struck unless one knows the facts.</p>

<p>It is in this context that the Durban city council, with the assistance of the CSIR, have embarked on a project for the disposal of sewage sludge into the sea. The Water Research Commission makes the point that where conditions are favourable, the sea is the most logical and economical receiving body for those wastes and that properly engineered and controlled, it should do no damage to marine resources.</p>

<p>Since 1968 Durban has two submarine outfalls which discharge settled sewage into the sea from the central and southern works. The Water Research Commission says the effects of these discharges, i.e. the existing settled sewage discharges, on the sea and beaches have been the subject of intensive monitoring programmes for several years and are still being monitored. However, what it does not tell us, is what precisely the effects have been found to be as a result of these monitoring programmes. One assumes that results show that these have not had a damaging effect. However, one would like to know more about what the effects are. Since 1968 only settled effluent has been disposed of into the sea from Durban, but what is being done now in the new project is that sewage sludge will be taken out to sea in the same pipelines which since 1968 have only discharged settled effluent. In other words, what will now happen in Durban is that the raw sludge which was previously removed before discharge into the sea, will now be returned to the two effluent pipes that exist for discharge into the sea. At page 36 the report of the Water Research Commission says that this is the only place in South Africa where this is done. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to enlighten us as regards a report in <i>The Argus</i> of the 15th of this month in which a certain vice-chairman of the Coordinating Council for Nature Conservation in the Cape reacts to a statement by the hon. the Minister that more than 100 million tons of sewage sludge was dumped in False Bay each year. I do not know whether this is a question of terminology or semantics and I do not know whether what is fact happening in False Bay is that settled effluent is being dumped into the sea because, as I have pointed out, on page 36 of the Report of the Water Research Commission it is stated that the only place in South Africa where this is happening is in Durban. Perhaps the hon. the Minister can enlighten us on this aspect.</p>

<p>I am returning to Durban now because this is a particular interest of mine. According to the report there will for two years be a monitoring programme involving sampling and analysing of surface and bottom water and of sediment in the discharge area for selected bacteria, micro-solids and toxic substances. Apparently the beaches will also be monitored for selected bacteria, other microorganisms and organic matter while accumulator organisms such as mussels and oysters will be monitored for heavy metals and bacteria. The hon. the Minister in answer to a question on 7 August 1981 said that the Durban city council had on 6 May 1981 been given only a two year permit. That, presumably, will be while this monitoring will be undertaken. He said that the scheme in fact had commenced on 10 June 1981. The hon. the Minister in answer to questions also said that there was now a written agreement between the Durban city council and the Water <span class="col_875-876" refersTo="page_0465"/>Research Commission which set out, as I understand it, the details of the monitoring required by the Water Research Commission. The hon. the Minister also stated that since the commencement of the project, which is presumably 10 June 1981, &#x201C;no untoward chemical or bacteriological circumstances have as yet been reported by the Durban city chemist and the CSIR, either in the sea or on the beaches&#x201D;, and in conclusion he stated: &#x201C;From investigations to date it can be concluded that no marine wastes have hitherto resulted in conditions which are hazardous to marine or human life.&#x201D; That is as much as we, the public, know.</p>

<p>I should now like to make a plea to the hon. the Minister in this regard. Because of the high level of concern and the intensity of the feelings that this matter has aroused in Durban, I appeal to the hon. the Minister to arrange three things. First of all, I should like to ask him to arrange that regular and frequent reports of the results of the monitoring tests be published for the benefit of the public. Secondly, I appeal to the hon. the Minister to ensure that such regular reports inform the public precisely as to what the particular results are. In other words, the public should not merely be informed as to whether the line has been crossed into conditions which are hazardous to human or marine life, but the precise results should be published. Thirdly, I ask the hon. the Minister to ensure that there be an explanation in such reports for the public of the significance of these findings so that the public not only knows when ultimately the line has been crossed into hazardous conditions to human or marine life, but so that it also knows and will be aware of how the environment is being affected, if at all, and how the situation is developing. All this I believe is necessary, because it seems to me that a comparatively large number of marine outfalls exist in Natal on a comparatively short coast. I believe that if the hon. the Minister would cause that to happen, the fears of the public would be allayed or, alternatively, would be heightened if the results were bad. At any rate, they would know the results. Either way, I suggest to the hon. the Minister, the public is, firstly, entitled to know what is happening to its heritage and its environment and, secondly, the public ought to be encouraged to take some interest in its environment, because ultimately it is the public who are affected.</p>

<p>I may say to the hon. the Minister that I myself, for example, am curious not as to whether there is a hazard to human life or marine life after three months of sludge disposal into the sea, but whether in fact there is any change at all in the samples of seawater and beach taken and, if there is, in precisely what way. I accordingly plead with the hon. the Minister to make arrangements for that kind of information to be made available to the public and, may I suggest, on something like a three-monthly basis or, if that will be too difficult, at least every six months.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, wanneer &#x2019;n mens kom by so &#x2019;n pragtige en omvattende onderwerp soos die Pos Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewings-bewaring, is die 10 minute wat tot my be-skikking is by verre nie voldoende om die aspekte te dek waaroor ek graag sou wou praat nie. Die vorige agb. spreker sal my dus verskoon as ek geensins op enige van sy argumente reageer nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag by ons nuwe agb. Minister, dr. Nak van der Merwe, begin. Dit is algemeen bekend dat &#x2019;n organisasie of besigheid of vereniging in &#x2019;n groot mate so goed funksioneer en suksesvol is as wat die vermo&#x00EB;, visie en bekwaamheid van die persoon wat aan die roer daarvan staan, toelaat. Omdat dr. Van der Merwe hoof is van die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring, weet ons dat dit met hierdie departement voortaan, soos in die verlede, goed sal gaan. Sedert ek in die Parlement gekom het, was ek in die gelukkige posisie om elke keer in hierdie portefeulje &#x2019;n besonder bekwame Minister te vind. Dit was eers Minister Fanie Botha, wat by baie mense bekend was as Fanie Water. Later was dit Minister Braam Raubenheimer, by sommige van ons bekend as Braam die Doener. Nou glo ek het ons dr. Nak, die Wyse.</p>

<p>Ek is beslis al man in hierdie Komitee vanmiddag wat vanwe&#x00EB; my naam geregtig is om aan die agb. Minister te s&#x00EA; dat ek glo dat hy vanwe&#x00EB; die kwaliteite vervat in sy naam &#x2019;n besondere sukses van hierdie portefeulje gaan maak. Ek wil vandag die agb. Minister gelukwens en bedank en dan ook die vrymoedigheid <span class="col_877-878" refersTo="page_0466"/>neem om namens tussen 70 000 en 80 000 Van der Merwes oor die hele Suid-Afrika te s&#x00EA; dankie dat hy die kroon gespan het op die arbeid van die Van der Merwes op vele terreine van die volksakker van Suid-Afrika. Dit is so dat die Van der Merwes feitlik dominant is op vele terreine in ons samelewing. Die Afrikaanse kerkterrein, die Afrikaanse onderwysterrein, die Afrikaanse kultuurterrein, die nywerheidsterrein, die landbouterrein, noem dit maar en die Van der Merwes is daar. Op die politieke terrein is ons op die oomblik nie minder nie as sewe teenwoordig in die Parlement van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika. Volgens die rekords is dit &#x2019;n rekord vir die-selfde naam op dieselfde tyd teenwoordig in die Parlement sedert die Unie van Suid-Afrika en nou ook in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>Dink net hoe arm Suid-Afrika sou gewees het son-der die Van der Merwes. &#x2019;n Mens wat nie kan lag nie, is &#x2019;n ongelukkige mens. Dink net hoe arm Suid-Afrika sou gewees het sonder die humor van die Van der Merwes. Ons wil dus vir die agb. Minister, dr. Van der Merwe, s&#x00EA; dat ons glo dat hy die suksespad wat hy tot dusver in die openbare lewe geloop het verder sal bekroon in die belangrike posisie wat hy nou beklee. Nogmaals ons gelukwense, ons wense van voorspoed en se&#x00EB;n vorentoe.</p>

<p>Dit is ook so dat twee karperde beter is as een. Die agb. Minister se trekmaat vorentoe sal mnr. J. F. Otto wees. Mnr. Otto is ook redelik nuut in die baie groot posisie wat hy nou beklee. Komende uit my omgewing waar hy letterlik en figuurlik gedrink het van die water van my w&#x00EA;reld, is ek met die mate van kennis wat ek van hom het, vandag in die posisie om te kan s&#x00EA; dat mnr. Otto ook in hierdie ho&#x00EB; pos besondere onderskeiding sal behaal.</p>

<p>Wanneer ons oor water praat, is dit vir my onvermydelik om by die Vaalrivier te begin. Hy wat in normale tye soos &#x2019;n stille, besadigde reus deur my kiesafdeling vloei. Hierdie selfde stille reus kan egter binne enkele ure ontaard in &#x2019;n brullende, tierende monster wat met golwende en kolkende geweld alles voor hom wegvee en verswelg wanneer hy so voel. Dit is so asof hy vir ons in daar-die tye van verwoesting wil s&#x00EA;: Julle moet versigtig wees, in normale tye is julle besig om my waters te ooreis. Hierdie rivier met sy vaal waters wat suiping verskaf aan duisende en duisende stuks vee wat dikwels in droogtetye die walkante tot modderpoeletjies vertrap, waar die geel-en die rooivinke hulle nessies in die fluitjiesriet maak en die reier langbeen en langnek kyk na sy prooi wanneer hy paddavissies en krappies vang, sy water vind later &#x2019;n pad na die ontwikkelde gebiede van die Vaaldriehoek en die Witwatersrand. Dit is hierdie selfde water waarin die geel-en silwervis speel, dit is hierdie selfde vaal drinkwater van die Ho&#x00EB;veldse beeste en die skape, hierdie selfde water wat die tuiste is van die paddas en die krappe, hierdie selfde water wat die jagplek van die reiers is, wat in ysblokkies gegiet word en voorgesit word aan belangrike persone in Pretoria, miskien in die Burgerspark-hotel aan &#x2019;n Henry Kissinger om in sy whisky te gooi. Dit is hierdie selfde vaal water wat gister en eergister vol modder en afsaksel was wat nadat dit die reinigingsprosesse in my kiesafdeling by die Swartkoppies-en Suiker-bospompstasies deurgaan het, geskik is vir die fynste menslike gebruik. Dit is ook hierdie selfde vaal water van gister en eergister wat vandag en more vir vele jong dametjies en mans wanneer hulle van die werk af kom &#x2019;n lafenis bied in &#x2019;n aangename koel swem-bad.</p>

<p>Byna &#x2019;n derde van die mense van die Republiek van Suid-Afrika is op een of ander manier afhanklik van die waters van hierdie dominante rivier in my kiesafdeling, die Vaalrivier. Dit is so dat dit baie water verg om een ton staal te giet. Dit is ook so dat dit daagliks baie water verg om miljoene rande by wyse van nywerheidsprodukte te kan verdien wat in die Vaaldriehoek en aan die Witwatersrand geproduseer word.</p>

<p>Waar ek ges&#x00EA; het dat die ou Vaal, wanneer hy ons met sy siedende massas wil waarsku dat ons besig is om hom in normale tye te ooreis, wil ek s&#x00EA; dat ons vorentoe twee dinge sal moet doen. As ek vanmiddag &#x2019;n spesifieke punt in my toespraak wil beklemtoon, is dit dat ons, in die eerste plek, water in die toekoms moet bespaar. Die metodes waarop dit gedoen kan word, kan ons <span class="col_879-880" refersTo="page_0467"/>bedink en later daaroor praat, maar water moet bespaar word. In die tweede plek moet nuwe bronne geskep word. Hier verwys ek spesifiek na &#x2019;n bron in my kiesafdeling, nl. die Suikerbosrandrivier waarvan daar in re&#x00EB;ntye eenvoudig massas en massas water wegvloei. Met &#x2019;n baie kort stuwal kan hier-die rivier opgedam word tussen twee ho&#x00EB; oppe op die plaas Lagerspoort tussen die Suikerbosrante. Hier kan &#x2019;n enorme hoeveelheid water behou en bewaar word as hulp vir die Vaaldam om aangewend te word vir verdere ontwikkeling in die Vaaldrie-hoek-Witwatersrand-kompleks.</p>

<p>Wat dit aanbetref, kan ek vir die agb. Minister en die departement s&#x00EA; dat ons reeds in 1969 verto&#x00EB; gerig het vir &#x2019;n dam in die Suikerbosrandrivier. Die verto&#x00EB; het goed geloop tot op &#x2019;n punt en toe het dit doodgeloop. Ek dink dit is miskien omdat groot skemas soos die H. F. Verwoerd-en die P. K. le Roux-dam daardie tyd prioriteit geniet het. Suid-Afrika het water nodig en daarom moet waterbewaring en nuwe damme vir toekomstige ontwikkeling prioriteit geniet.</p>

<p>Wanneer ons na waterkonsumpsie vir voedselproduksie kyk, vind ons bv. dat &#x2019;n bees vanaf die ouderdom van een dag tot die ouderdom van drie jaar &#x00B1; 40 000 liter drinkwater gebruik. Om een kilogram bees-vleis te produseer verg &#x00B1; 6 000 liter water. Om voldoende koring vir een brood te produseer, verg &#x00B1; 1 300 liter water. Om een mieliekop te produseer, verg &#x00B1; 220 liter water. Interessantheidshalwe wil ek &#x2019;n syfer herhaal wat ek al vantevore in die Volksraad genoem het. Die Skotsman wat lief is vir sy whisky en twee whiskies per dag drink, sal vanaf sy 25ste jaar tot sy 75ste jaar &#x00B1; 4 500 liter water drink.</p>

<speech by="#hardingham">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. W. HARDINGHAM</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to follow on various aspects mentioned by the hon. member for Meyerton who has just spoken. The main theme of my speech this afternoon will be water conservation.</p>

<p>I would like to commence my speech by saying that I feel that one of our top priorities in this country is the question of water conservation. We must realize that we will hardly be able to meet the demands for water in the future with our present system of conservation. It is essential that we look at every possible means to conserve water so that in the years to come we will be in a position to meet all requirements.</p>

<p>We are all aware of the irregular pattern regarding to the production of agricultural commodities in this country and that this is mainly due to the fact that we are subjected to such uncertain weather conditions. It becomes very apparent that the future food requirements of this country will only be met by more intensive methods of production. This can only be achieved with certainty&#x2014;I should like to repeat &#x201C;with certainty&#x201D;&#x2014;by the improved utilization of natural water resources. I refer here specifically to irrigation. We are also aware of the increasing demand for water by the urban and industrial sectors. We are also aware of the fact that the demand of agriculture for water far exceeds that of industry. It is very likely that this trend will continue. Therefore, it is obvious that we are coming to a stage in this country where before long the demand for water could become more competitive between the various sectors. In other words, what I am trying to say is that the availability of water could actually become a restrictive factor in the country&#x2019;s future development.</p>

<p>With this in mind it becomes apparent that the whole question of water utilization and its availability is a matter of top priority. It is here that I would like to raise a particular point in regard to water conservation. I wish to call on the department and on the hon. the Minister to give very serious consideration to the possibility of water storage in the mountain catchment areas of the country <span class="col_881-882" refersTo="page_0468"/>by means of impoundments to ensure that the vast quantities of water which become available in the normal rain period are held and accumalated and restrained from flowing unimpeded into the sea. I see such impoundments in the upper reaches of our rivers and our catchment areas as serving a number of purposes.</p>

<p>I see this as a basis of providing a stabilized water flow throughout the year. This is one of the biggest problems that we have in relation to our perennial rivers. The adequate supply of water during the dry periods is a matter of tremendous importance, because it is the adequate supply of water during the dry periods that dictates to a great degree the survival of aquatic life. Let us be quite frank&#x2014;it is the fluctuating trend apparent at present in so many of our rivers&#x2014;from their high peaks to their low flow&#x2014;that is tending to destroy or affect detrimentally the entire aquatic life metabolism existent in these rivers. It is clear to me that as a result the whole environment could be affected.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with another matter in the limited time at my disposal. I wish to refer to the large development that has taken place in afforestation in certain areas of the Natal midlands. In particular I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the apparent disregard by organizations and people concerned for the provisions of the Water Act restricting the planting of trees within 20 metres of water courses and sponges. I have been asked to raise this matter in regard to a particular area and from the particular point of view of one of the towns in Natal, and this is the town of Richmond. This area has been greatly affected in recent years by the afforestation that has taken place in its water catchment areas. The effects which this has had on the town of Richmond have been far-reaching. Over the years the water supplies available to this township have been affected to such a degree that the whole development of the town of Richmond has virtually come to a halt. It is unable to expand in respect of urbanization. It is unable to expand industrially. The reason for this is that there has been and I repeat, a disregard in the afforestation areas of the provisions of the Water Act that trees should be planted 20 metres away from water courses and sponges. I would like to suggest that the Minister give consideration as to whether the time has not arrived for a more practical enforcement of this regulation, because this affects not only the town of Richmond to which I have referred, but other towns as well. It affects those people living in the valleys below, and I would venture to ask whether the time has not come for consideration to be given to even extending the 20 metre limit to a degree which will be far more practical and in keeping with the preservation of the natural water flow.</p>

<p>I feel I cannot let this opportunity go without referring to what I feel is a very important recreational factor made available to the public in the forestry areas, particularly those in Natal. I refer to the wilderness areas and the hiking trails. The pleasure that this has given the public is something for which the department can take a lot of credit. I see the need to retain, in this context, the essence of the natural environment, and the importance and the necessity of preserving the natural habitat. Without this the initial motivation for such wilderness areas and hiking trails will lose it&#x2019;s effectiveness. [Time expired.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. F. VAN HEERDEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Mooirivier het &#x2019;n baie interessante toespraak gehou oor waterbewaring. Daar sal ook van my kollegas aan hierdie kant oor di&#x00E9; onderwerp praat. Vergun my om vir die agb. Minister baie welkom te s&#x00EA; in hierdie departement. Ek wens hom alle goeie wense en sterkte toe by die hantering van hierdie baie belangrike departement.</p>

<p>Die snel groeiende ekonomie en die verhoging in die lewenstandaard van die mense binne die grense van die Republiek is die twee belangrikste faktore in die ho&#x00EB;r aanvraag na water. &#x2019;n Verdere belangrike faktor wat bydra tot die styging in die aanvraagtempo na water is die verwagte bevolkingsaanwas van bykans 3&#x0025; per jaar oor die volgende dekade. Die verwagte toename in waterverbruik sal dan ook 3&#x0025; per jaar oor die volgende tien jaar wees. In 1978 was die waterverbruik ongeveer 11 537 miljoen kubieke meters. Hierdie verbruik sal na verwagting binne die volgende 20 jaar verdubbel. Daar is verskeie faktore wat die vraag na fondse vir verdere waterbron-ontwikkeling bepaal, en ek wil kortliks by &#x2019;n <span class="col_883-884" refersTo="page_0469"/>paar van hulle stilstaan. Eerstens is dit so dat die bron soms ver van die aanvraagpunt verwyder is. Ons dink hier aan water wat oor groot afstande na die Vaalrivierbekken vervoer moet word, en ook aan die Kaapse Skiereiland en omgewing. Die afstande waaroor water vervoer sal word, sal in die toekoms noodwendig toeneem en ook natuurlik in verhouding meer fondse vereis. Tweedens moet ons in gedagte hou dat die goedkoopste damterreine natuurlik eerste benut word met die gevolg dat die konstruksie van damme vergelykenderwys al hoe duurder sal word. Derdens sal die vraag na water vir nywerheids-en stedelike verbruik al hoe meer toeneem. Al hoe meer fondse sal nodig wees om rioolwater vir hergebruik te suiwer. Fondse sal ook in &#x2019;n toenemende mate benodig word vir die kontrole van die kwaliteit van die water in ons verskillende rivierstelsels. Ons kan vierdens ons gedagtes laat gaan na die verhoging in boukoste wat vir die departement oor die afgelope tien jaar ongeveer 13&#x0025; per jaar beloop het.</p>

<p>As gevolg van hierdie faktore word beraam dat besteding aan werke vir water-bron-ontwikkeling teen 6&#x0025; jaarliks in re&#x00EB;le terme moet toeneem. Maar wat vind ons, wat is werklik die posisie? Sedert 1973 was daar so &#x2019;n afname in die toekenning van fondse vir waterbron-ontwikkeling dat die besteding in die afgelope boekjaar, in re&#x00EB;le terme, slegs 50&#x0025; van die besteding gedurende 1970-&#x2019;71 bedra het&#x2014;in werklikheid &#x2019;n afname van 6&#x0025; in plaas van &#x2019;n toename van 6&#x0025;. Ons is dus weer in dieselfde posisie as in die vroe&#x00EB;r sestigerjare. Ons is weer besig om &#x2019;n agterstand in watervoorsiening in sommige gebiede op te bou. Die moontlikheid bestaan alreeds dat daar in &#x2019;n volgende droogtesiklus waterbeperkings in hierdie gebiede ingestel sal moet word. Daarom is dit nodig dat ons nou voorkeure moet bepaal. Die agb. Minister en sy departement sit met die probleemdat hulle nie genoeg fondse beskikbaar het vir nuwe waterbron-ontwikkeling nie. Hulle sit verder met &#x2019;n ander probleem, naamlik dat daar in die P. K. le Roux-dam genoeg water opgegaar is om 100 000 ha te besproei, maar dat die opgegaarde water nie doeltreffend gebruik kan word nie omdat die fondse te min is om die kanale te bou vir die verspreiding van die water.</p>

<p>Die verbouing van voedsel vir mens endier sal al hoe groter voorkeur moet geniet. Ons sal voedsel moet produseer wat nie noodwendig die hoogste netto wins lewer nie. Die boer sal op so &#x2019;n wyse bygestaan moet word dat hy voedsel in landsbelang kan produseer. Ek glo dat die huidige selfvoor-sienendheid beperk is. Met die toename in bevolking sal die vraag na voedsel vinnig toeneem. Dit is noodsaaklik dat die Republiek van Suid-Afrika die grootste en betrou-baarste voedselverskaffer in Afrika moet wees. Dit is in ons belang, dit is in belang van Afrika en dit is ook in belang van die hele Vrye W&#x00EA;reld. Die voorkeure moet nou bepaal word. Ek wil aan die hand gee dat ons by die P. K. le Roux-dam begin. As eerste voorkeur wil ek aan die hand doen dat die duikpype vanaf die Ramah-kanaal soos beplan nou gebou word, sodat al die beskikbare gronde aan die suideroewer besproei kan word. Moontlik kan daar ook in die Fluitjieskraalgebied met min koste nog meer grond besproei word. Ek stel as volgende voorkeur voor dat die noorder oewer-hoofkanaal gebou word sodat besproeiing vir die bestaande Riet-en Laer Rietrivierskema voorsien kan word. Hierdie boere is &#x2019;n lang tyd al in die knyp as gevolg van te min water vir besproeiing. &#x2019;n Mens kan aan verdere voorbeelde dink, byvoorbeeld om &#x2019;n stuwal of stuwalle onderkant die P. K. le Roux-dam te bou, onder andere naby Douglas. Hiervandaan kan water na Bucklands, Douglas en selfs tot by die Plooysburggebied geneem word. Moontlik kan hierdie stuwalle so ontwerp word dat daar ook hidro-elektrisiteit opgewek word. Die feit dat dieselfde water oor en oor gebruik word, behoort hierdie klein hidro-elektriese skemas ekonomies te regverdig.</p>

<p>Die departement sit met &#x2019;n probleemdat beskikbare fondse oor &#x2019;n lang tyd versprei moet word terwyl koste in die tussentyd opgejaag word. Om &#x2019;n groot projek te voltooi neem ongeveer tien jaar. Ek glo dat as daar langer mee gewag word om hierdie departement van genoeg fondse te voorsien, Suid-Afrika op &#x2019;n ramp sal afstuur sover dit die voorsiening van water aangaan. Daar moet nie uit die oog verloor word dat daar intussen deur die departement voortgegaan moet word met verbeteringswerke op bestaande skemas nie. Intussen is daar ook al van die ander skemas wat 40 jaar gelede gebou is wat gedeeltelik of in die geheel herbou <span class="col_885-886" refersTo="page_0470"/>moet word. Dit beteken meer fondse. Met die re&#x00EB;le afname in besteding gaan die departement voorwaar &#x2019;n moeilike tydperk tegemoet en ons land gaan &#x2019;n agterstand opbou met waterbron-ontwikkeling wat sy mense vorentoe baie nadelig gaan tref.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir De Aar wil baie werk laat doen. Soos ons gehoor het, is daar nie fondse be-skikbaar nie. Ek weet nie of hulle in De Aar se w&#x00EA;reld ook iets het om te belas, soos brandewyn nie. Miskien kan hulle belasting daarop hef en help daarso.</p>

<p>Ek wil praat oor die wegkeer of wegvoer van water uit die een opvanggebied na &#x2019;n ander, maar alvorens ek daartoe oorgaan, wil ek eers my gelukwense aan ons agb. nuwe Minister van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring uitspreek. Dit is &#x2019;n vreeslike lang naam en ek hoop ons agb. Minister kan vir di&#x00E9; kind in die toekoms &#x2019;n korter naam gee. Ek weet ons agb. Minister is vertroud met watersake en hy vat ook nie lank om &#x2019;n saak te snap en om leiding te gee nie. Sy antwoorde is kort en hy praat hard genoeg&#x2014;ons kan hom hoor.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is en kom uit die Bre&#x00EB;rivier-vallei. Sonder vrees vir teen-spraak wil ek vanmiddag hier s&#x00EA; dat dit een van die beste valleie in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika is. Dit is hoofsaaklik &#x2019;n landbougebied, en nie net is dit van die beste land-bouvalleie nie, maar jy kry ook daar van die beste boere in die Republiek van Suid-Afrika. Die grootste persentasie van hierdie boere is besproeiingsboere en vir hulle is water van kardinale belang, en hulle is baie heilig daarop. By ons was dit en is dit nog steeds so&#x2014;&#x201E;Vat liewer aan &#x2019;n man se vrou maar los sy besproeiingswater uit&#x201D;. Anders is daar moeilikheid. Nou het die Staat aan ons water kom vat.</p>

<p>Wag, ek sal julle nooi, wag maar. Mnr. die Voorsitter, in die beperkte tyd tot my beskikking kan ek nou nie die hele storie vertel van die water wat by ons geneem is nie. Kortliks kom dit daarop neer dat &#x2019;n Witskrif ter Tafel gel&#x00EA; is&#x2014; ek het sy nommer ook nog al hier: W.P. R&#x2014;81. Voorgestelde Elandsrivier-Theewaterskloof-uitkering. Dit kom net daarop neer dat uit die water Bre&#x00EB;rivier-gebied uitge-keer word na die Bergriviervallei. Dit is net so eenvoudig dat hulle daar &#x2019;n tonnel bou vir padverkeer en nou l&#x00EA; hulle die pype binne in die tonnel, dan maak hulle dit toe en dan loop die water onder en die motor-karre bo op die water. Dit is eintlik die hele storie. Hierdie water sal hoofsaaklik vir stedelike gebruik aangewend word&#x2014;vir Kaapstad en omgewing. Ons in die Bre&#x00EB;rivier-vallei is nie so snaaks of so suinig dat ons nie vir ons ma, of ons moerderstad, wil help nie &#x2014;maar nie alvorens in ons behoeftes voorsien is nie&#x2014;en dit is keer op keer aan ons belowe. Ons wil darem mos nou nie vir ma vet voer en daar gaan die kind nou van honger of dors dood nie. Daar is baie water in die Bre&#x00EB;riviervallei. Volgens gegewens tot my beskikking is die gemiddelde jaarlikse afloop van die Bre&#x00EB;rivier in die omgewing van 1 800 miljoen kubieke meter. Dit is die hoogste afloop van alle waterbronne in die Boland. Die totale gemiddelde jaarlikse afloop van al die Bolandse riviere is in die omtrek van 5 000 miljoen kubieke meter en hiervan lewer die Bre&#x00EB;rivier bykans 2 000 miljoen kubieke meter. Nou kan u vir my vra &#x201E;Maar hoekom staan en raas jy nou hier en julle het so baie water?&#x201D; Maar op hierdie oomblik gebruik ons maar net 450 miljoen kubieke meter&#x2014;die ander vloei weg see toe. Ek weet dat die see water moet h&#x00EA;, maar hoekom moet die Bre&#x00EB;rivier dan nou verdomp alleen die see vol maak? Ek herhaal: Voorsien eers in die plaaslike behoeftes voordat oorgegaan word om gebiede buite ons opvanggebied te voorsien.</p>

<p>In die verslag van die Kommissie van Ondersoek insake Wateraangeleenthede lees ek dat aan die einde van hierdie eeu 93&#x0025; van die Blankes, 92&#x0025; van die Asi&#x00EB;rs, 86&#x0025; van die Kleurlinge en 75&#x0025; van die Swartes in die Republiek verstedelik sal wees. En luister nou mooi vir my, 90&#x0025; van die bruto binnelandse inkomste sal ook teen daardie tyd deur die sekond&#x00EA;re en tersi&#x00EA;re sektore van die volkshuishouding bygedra word&#x2014; deur die landbou, slegs 6&#x0025;. Waarheen is ons op pad? Hierdie tendens moet stop. Hoekom moet die stede ten koste van die platteland groei? Is geld al norm waarmee ons vandag meet? My pa het altyd ges&#x00EA; geld is niks, maar ek weet dit is &#x2019;n neukery as jy hom nie het nie. Maar al is geld ook hoe <span class="col_887-888" refersTo="page_0471"/>belangrik sal ons wrange vrugte pluk as ons nie na die platteland kyk en veral na die Bre&#x00EB;rivier-gebied nie. En hier kan die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring &#x2019;n baie groot rol speel. Hulle doen dit reeds en ons is hulle baie dankbaar daarvoor, maar veel meer kan gedoen word. Ons weet van die geldnood, maar uit die Wes-Kaap kry die Staat darem meer as sy deel uit aksynsbelasting&#x2014;ons vra nie net nie, ons gee ook en ons gee baie.</p>

<p>Dit is so dat ons op die oomblik hier in die Wes-Kaap met produkte boer waarvan daar &#x2019;n oorskot is, maar dit is van tydelike aard, dit sal weer oorwaai. Dit gaan nie so goed met die boer in die Wes-Kaap, in die Bre&#x00EB;ri-vier-vallei, op die oomblik nie, maar gaan l&#x00EA; sal ons nooit! U moet ook nie dink dat ons ons geloof in ons bedryf verloor het nie; daarvoor is ons te diep ingewortel en in-gegrawe. Ons sal graag wil sien dat meer daadwerklike stappe gedoen word om ontwikkeling aan te moedig daar in die gebiede waar die water is en ekonomies aangewend kan word. Ons moet vorentoe ook mos kyk. Op die oomblik besproei ons daar in die Bre&#x00EB;riviervallei 74 000 ha. Daar is bykans nog 80 000 ha beskikbaar. Ons moet kyk na die water. As die water eers weg is, dan is hy weg. Ek mag verkeerd wees, maar ek dink nie dat die liewe Vader daar anderkant die berg sou laat re&#x00EB;n het as hy nie bedoel het dat ons die water daar moet gebruik nie. Anders sou hy mos hier laat re&#x00EB;n het, hier waar hulle dit nou wil h&#x00EA;. Dit is goedkoper om mense na die water toe te bring as om water na die mense toe te bring. Ek weet nie of u my verstaan nie, maar dit is soos ek nou dink. Dit kos mos nie &#x2019;n oulap stuiwer om water op te gaar en te voorsien nie. Alles kos geld en ons moet ons koste baie fyn bereken&#x2014;waar ons dit op die mees ekono-miese manier kan aanwend. In die verslag van die Kommissie van Ondersoek insake Wateraangeleenthede staan daar duidelik en uitdruklik&#x2014;dit werk nou eintlik teen my&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die Republiek is daar gelukkig geen algemene wetlike beperking op die oor-bring van water van een rivierbekken na &#x2019;n ander nie. Dit onthef die owerhede wat verantwoordelik is vir sodanige oorpla-sings egter nie van die noodsaaklikheid om &#x2019;n baie sorgvuldige vergelyking te tref tussen die voordele en koste wat daarby betrokke is, nie slegs in die gebied van oorsprong nie, maar ook in die ontvangende gebied.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. A. MYBURGH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to give the Minister two opportunities this afternoon to make himself famous. The first one concerns the Pongola-poort dam and the entire scheme planned around this dam. For the last 10 years or so there was an on-going debate as to what the future of that undertaking was going to be. It has cost the taxpayers of South Africa something like R45 million. For the last seven or eight years questions were put on the Order Paper to try to establish what the future of that undertaking was going to be. Each year we received slightly dissimilar or even entirely different answers as to why the dam was not yet functional. I do understand that in the last year quite a bit of work was done about negotiations with our neighbouring State, and that there is a possibility that the Minister will be able to make an announcement today which will please all our hearts immensely. I would like him to use this opportunity so that in future this question can be kept off the Question Paper, because it has been appearing there as regularly as clockwork while in the meantime everybody in South Africa is wondering why on earth that investment was made. I would like the hon. the Minister to deal with this subject later this afternoon.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, &#x2019;n ander saak wat ek graag wil aanroer is die volgende: In die verlede is ons waterbronne baie dikwels op &#x2019;n <i>ad</i> <i>hoc</i>-basis ontwikkel, sonder dat daar &#x2019;n langtermynprogram opgetrek is waarin al die langtermynprioriteite uitgewerk is soos &#x2019;n mans kan verwag dat dit gedoen sou word. Dikwels is &#x2019;n politieke of sosio-ekonomiese behoefte bevredig sonder dat die langter-mynvoordele die nodige aandag geniet het. Witskrifte is in die verlede al te dikwels daarop gemik om &#x2019;n bepaalde skema te probeer regverdig, en was gebrekkig in die sin dat <span class="col_889-890" refersTo="page_0472"/>die voordele van die skema gestel teen die koste daarvan, in detail, ontbreek het. Die bewys hiervan is die talie skemas wat voor 1970 op &#x2019;n halfgebakte wyse aangepak is. Dat nie een van hulle deur middel van die verkoop van water die kapitale koste kon dek nie, is vir my &#x2019;n bewys dat die beplanning nie altyd ten volle na wense was nie. Selfs die rente op kapitaal en die bedryfs-kostes word vandag, met enkele uitsonde-rings, nie verhaal nie. Ek voel dat baie dringend aan hierdie sake aandag gegee moet word, want &#x2019;n belastingbetaler in hierdie Raad, maar ook &#x2019;n belastingbetaler buite hierdie Raad, sou graag wil weet en daarvan verseker wil word dat sy fondse reg bestee word. Ek weet dat daar voor 1970 sekere beleidsrigtings was waarvolgens die ekono-miese noodsaaklikheid van hierdie be-sproeiingskemas op &#x2019;n ander basis uitgewerk is as wat vandag die geval is. Nogtans voel ek dat die Minister aan daardie aangeleent-hede betreffende die bedryfskoste en die rente op kapitaal aandag moet gee. Gesien die geweldige koste van die nuwe projekte en die beperkte hoeveelheid water wat in Suid-Afrika beskikbaar is, moet daar na my mening &#x2019;n baie versigtige evaluering gedoen word wanneer enige nuwe skema aangepak word. Dit is natuurlik nie slegs die sigbare ekonomiese voordele wat in ag geneem moet word nie, maar ook die sogenaamde versteekte voordele soos die verskaffing van werkgeleenthede, die stabilisering van &#x2019;n gemeenskap en die verbetering van die kwaliteit van die gelewerde produk. Al daardie dinge moet in ag geneem word. In die verlede, glo ek, het sekere van daardie aspekte nie genoeg aandag gekry nie.</p>

<p>Ons aan hierdie kant van die Raad besef verder dat water een van die kerninsette is by die verskaffing van nuwe werkgeleenthede, en die verskaffing van nuwe werkgeleenthede is juis, sover dit die toekoms betref, een van Suid-Afrika se grootste knelpunte. Juis om daardie rede moet daar aanvaar word dat die stede hul aanspraak op nuwe water sal verstewig en dat die persentasie wat die stede in die toekoms sal trek, steeds sal toeneem. Ek verstaan dat die huidige persentasie vir besproeiing ongeveer 77&#x0025; is en dat die stede slegs ongeveer 23&#x0025; van die water trek. Daardie verhouding sal natuurlik moet verander. Ons aanvaar dit, en ek dink die agb. Minister en sy departement aanvaar dit ook.</p>

<p>Dit beteken egter nie dat landbouwater vandag onbelangrik geword het nie. Die kommissie wat wateraangeleenthede in 1970 ondersoek het, het juis aangedui dat Suid-Afrika, wat voedsel betref, vandag reeds selfversorgend is. Die kommissie het ook ges&#x00EA; dat daar nie &#x2019;n behoefte is aan groot-skaalse addisionele water vir landboudoel-eindes nie. Dit is wat die kommissie in 1970 ges&#x00EA; het. Ek dink dat as &#x2019;n mens redelik wil wees, kan jy jouself met daardie standpunt vereenselwig, maar wat beklemtoon moet word, is dat die waarde van die byvoeging van addisionele water tot die bestaande watervoorraad nie altyd deur almal na waarde geskat word nie. Ek verwys natuurlik na die beskikbaarstelling van addisionele water waar daar slegs beperkte water beskikbaar is. Dit kan ontsettend belangrik wees.</p>

<p>Ek wil dit aan die agb. Minister stel dat &#x2019;n gebied met &#x2019;n bestaande landbou-infrastruktuur, waar besproeiing reeds op &#x2019;n beperkte skaal toegepas word, geweldig kan baat by die beskikbaarstelling van sodanige addisionele water.</p>

<p>Dit bring my dan by die gebied wat ek graag met die agb. Minister wil bespreek. Ek verwys na die gebied wat gedek word deur die Paarl, Agter-Paarl, Simondium, Muldersvlei en Stellenbosch. Dit lyk my ek is daar so &#x2019;n bietjie in konflik met die agb. lid wat so pas gaan sit het. Die gebiede wat ek so pas genoem het, kan hul produksie beduidend vermeerder indien daar addisionele water in daardie gebiede beskikbaar gestel word. Dit is nie net die omvang van die produksie wat beduidend vermeerder kan word nie, maar dit is ook die kwaliteit van die produk wat aansienlik verbeter kan word.</p>

<p>Ek wil agb. lede net daaraan herinner dat dit in ons buitelandse markte, wat steeds meer kompeterend word, al hoe belangriker gaan word om te besef dat die produkte van die Wes-Kaap&#x2014;d.w.s. vrugte, sagtevrugte en ook wyn&#x2014;slegs sal kan kompeteer indien die gehalte van die allerhoogste is. Daarom is dit vir my onverstaanbaar dat die werk aan die Simonsbergkanaal of-pyplyn oor die afgelope paar jaar so gesloer het. Ek kan dit net nie begryp nie. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<p>Mnr. die <span class="col_891-892" refersTo="page_0473"/>Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Wynberg moet my asseblief verskoon as ek nie te veel tyd aan sy toespraak bestee nie. Toe ek dit verlede keer gedoen het, kon ek my toespraak nie voltooi nie.</p>

<p>Ek het twee sake wat ek graag gedurende die bespreking van hierdie Begrotingspos wil behandel. Die eerste is eintlik &#x2019;n dankbetuiging en het betrekking op die vloedramp van 25 en 26 Januarie vanjaar wat &#x2019;n magdom van probleme nagelaat het. Benewens die bykans 1 000 ha grond wat heeltemal weggespoel het en die honderde hektare grond wat beskadig is, insluitende wingerde, vrug-teboorde en lusernlande, is die besproeiing-stelsels op feitlik al die geaffekteerde plase erg beskadig. Uitkeerwalle in riviere is totaal weggespoel, op sommige plekke het rivier-beddings uitgeklawe en op ander plekke is die riviere toegeslik, met die gevolg dat die riviere se hele struktuur grootliks verander is. By sommige uitkeerwalle was besproei-ingskanale, waarin die water uitgekeer moet word, ná die vloed tot 15 meter ho&#x00EB;r as die rivierbodem.</p>

<p>Vir die betrokke boere het dit ernstige probleme geskep. Waarop dit in werklikheid neergekom het, is dat rivierlope eers hervestig moes word alvorens die uitkeerwalle en waterskemas herstel kon word. Water is die lewensaar van enige besproeiingsplaas, en dit was dus noodsaaklik om besproeiingstelsels te hervestig. Hoe ironies dit ook al mag wees, was daar die vrees dat boorde en wingerde ná die vloed miskien beskadig sou kon word as gevolg van droogte indien be-sproeiingstelsels nie betyds herstel word nie.</p>

<p>Dit is verblydend om te kan s&#x00EA; dat die kommer en sorge grotendeels plek gemaak het vir nuwe hoop. Daar word in die algemeen met die werk goeie vordering gemaak, en die geteisterde gebiede toon reeds bemoedigende tekens van herstel.</p>

<p>Dit sou &#x2019;n onvergeeflike vergissing wees as die Departement van Waterwese se reuse-aandeel aan die herstelprojek misken word. Die departement, wat reeds noustrop getrek het as gevolg van personeeltekorte, het &#x2019;n reusetaak verrig om herstelwerk sover moontlik te bespoedig.</p>

<p>Dit is dan my voorreg om die agb. Minister en die Direkteur-generaal van Waterwese, mnr. Fred Otto, en sy personeel, asook die Afdelingsingenieur en sy personeel, opreg te bedank vir die voortreflike diens wat hulle gelewer het en vir die feit dat hulle &#x2019;n moeilike saak onder moeilike omstandighede met welslae aangedurf en afgehandel het.</p>

<p>Suid-Afrika is nie goed bedeeld met water nie. Trouens, daar is besproeiingsdele wat as skaarswaterdele beskou word, dele waar besproeiingslandbou soms moet ly as gevolg van &#x2019;n gebrek aan genoegsame water.</p>

<p>Die Klein Karoo is so &#x2019;n streek. Daar word beweer dat daar nie een dam in die Klein Karoo is wat ekonomies regverdigbaar is nie. In antwoord op aansoeke om dam-walle te vergroot of om nuwe damme op te rig ten einde meer water beskikbaar te h&#x00EA;, is die antwoord gewoonlik negatief omdat die water volgens berekening nie ekonomies genoeg benut kan word om die koste aan die skema te regverdig nie. Die aanbeveling is dan dat die beskikbare water liewers gebruik moet word om te voorsien in die behoeftes van ekstensiewe boerderyprojekte. Dit sal egter beteken dat eenhede in die Klein Karoo minstens vervierdubbel of vervyfdubbel moet word om enigsins ekonomiese ekstensiewe boerdery-eenhede te wees. Die gevolg van so &#x2019;n reeling sal noodlottig vir die Klein Karoo wees.</p>

<p>In die Verslag van die Kommissie van Ondersoek insake Wateraangeleenthede&#x2014; R.P.34/1970&#x2014;word daar op bladsy 15, in paragraaf 5(iv) onder die opskrif &#x201E;Die bepaling van prioriteite&#x201D; ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die kommissie beveel derhalwe aan dat nuwe skemas nie onderneem word voordat &#x2019;n grondige voordeelkoste-ondersoek eers aangegaan is nie. Sodanige ontledings moet egter op &#x2019;n sosio-ekonomiese en nie slegs op &#x2019;n finansi&#x00EB;le grondslag berus nie.</block>

<p>Op bladsy 140 van die verslag word daar in paragraaf 2 dan ook die volgende ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit word gemeen dat die volgende metodes, wat ook reeds dikwels elders aanvaar is, gebruik behoort te word vir die berekening van die voordele wat waterskemas in Suid-Afrika meebring:</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) Direkte landboukundige voordele behoort gebaseer te word op die netto verhoging in opbrengs wat verwag word om deur die gebruik van besproeiings-water verkry te word.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_893-894" refersTo="page_0474"/>&#x2019;n Mens kan sommetjies maak en bepaal wat die addisionele ekonomiese voordeel van die addisionele water sal wees as dit voorsien word. Ek haal verder aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die geval van hidroelektriese kragop-wekking kan die voordele bereken word in terme van die koste om alternatiewe termiese eenhede, wat dieselfde diens sal verrig, te lewer, aan die gang te hou en te onderhou.</block>

<p>Hidroelektriese kragopwekking kan &#x2019;n mens ook as &#x2019;n bate beskou wanneer daar oorweeg moet word of &#x2019;n waterskema of &#x2019;n damprojek aanvaar moet word al dan nie. Derdens is daar dan die waarde van water wat vir huishoudelike en industri&#x00EB;le doeleindes van so &#x2019;n dam verkry kan word.</p>

<p>Die vierde punt het betrekking op die ontspanningsvoordele. As &#x2019;n mens sommetjies maak, vind jy dat die ekonomiese realisering in hierdie verband maar baie klein is. Vyfdens, waar &#x2019;n waterskema vloedbeheer bevorder, kan &#x2019;n mens &#x2019;n primie plaas op die waarde van so &#x2019;n dam as &#x2019;n voorkomende maatre&#x00EB;l.</p>

<p>In die sesde instansie, en ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is ander ontasbare of indirekte voordele wat, soos in die geval van ontspanningsvoordele, moeilik te bereken is, bv. die uitwerking van &#x2019;n projek op streeksontwikkeling en die feit dat die aanbou van &#x2019;n skema moontlik sekere maatskaplike probleme mag verhinder. In al sulke gevalle, waar &#x2019;n redelike betroubare kwantitatiewe waardering nie moontlik is nie, behoort die veronderstelde voordele apart aangegee te word.</block>

<p>Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet besluit of daar &#x2019;n prys te betaal is om die Klein Karoo se huidige toestand te behou. Hier wil ek egter verskil met die agb. lid vir Wynberg wat krities is oor die feit dat damme se kapitale koste nie in die verlede deur die verkoop van water gerealiseer is nie. Ek wil beweer dat as ons hierdie stelsel in die toekoms sou voortsit, ons skaarswatergebiede&#x2014;waaronder ek die Klein Karoo tel&#x2014;totaal sou vernietig. My pleidooi is dus dat ons miskien &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r premie plaas op die sosio-ekonomiese voordele van &#x2019;n dam, in teenstelling met die blote indeling van grond in stukke van soveel hektaar wanneer daar berekenings gedoen word om vas te stel of &#x2019;n damprojek ekonomies of onekonomies is. Ek doen &#x2019;n dringende beroep op die agb. Minister omdat die Klein Karoo, soos dit tans daar uitsien, reeds &#x2019;n vestigingspunt is met reeds bestaande infrastrukture. Daar word &#x2019;n groot aantal Kleurlinge daar gehuisves, bv. in nedersettings soos Amalienstein, Zoar, Dysselsdorp en ander. Wat my betref, is dit gebiedend noodsaaklik dat &#x2019;n gebied soos hierdie, as gevolg van die waardes wat reeds geopen-baar is, behoue moet bly. Daarom doen ek graag hierdie beroep.

<p>Mnr. die Voorsit ter, ek glo die agb. Minister en die Departement van Waterwese sal ag slaan op die pleidooi van die agb. lid vir Swellendam. Ek wil graag by die agb. lid aansluit en ook oor damme praat, maar meer spesifiek damkom-gebiede. In my kiesafdeling is daar etlike duisende hektaar grond wat vir &#x2019;n damkom-gebied gereserveer is. Die damkomgrond word egter nie elke dag produktief benut nie. Ek kan miskien net aanvanklik noem dat daar vandag in Suid-Afrika &#x2019;n totaal van 222 000 ha grond is wat vir damkomgrondge-biede gereserveer word. Ek staan vandag op om nederig te vra dat daar opnuut gekyk word na daardie grond wat nutteloos daar l&#x00EA; en nie enige belangrike doel dien nie. Vandag is daar honderde jong boere wat smag na &#x2019;n stukkie grond. As ons hierdie grond sinvol kan verminder, kan daardie boere gehelp word om die landbou te betree. Daar is ook vandag baie boere wat op onekono-miese eenhede boer, wie se grond aangrensend is aan sulke damkomgronde. As stukke van daardie grond by die betrokke boere se plase gevoeg kon word, sou hulle oor ekonomiese eenhede beskik en sou hulle in staat gestel word om meer te produseer.</p>

<p>Die agb. Eerste Minister het die inisiatief geneem toe hy ges&#x00EA; het ons sal die desentra-&#x00FC;sasieprogram ons ems moet maak. Ons stede word vandag deur mense oorstroom. Ons sal opnuut die wekroep moet laat hoor: Terug na die platteland! In die jare wat voorl&#x00EA;, sal nywerheidsdesentralisasie &#x2019;n baie belangrike rol in die voortbestaan van ons land speel. As ek egter aan desentralisasie en dekonsentrasie dink, dink ek nie net aan nywerhede wat gedesentraliseer moet word nie, maar baie beslis ook aan landbouaktiwiteite. <span class="col_895-896" refersTo="page_0475"/>Indien ons ons boere op die plase kan hou, en nuwe boere daar kan vestig, kan en sal die landbou &#x2019;n belangrike rol speel om die verklaarde beleid van die Regering te realiseer.</p>

<p>In my kiesafdeling, Schweizer-Reneke, is daar &#x2019;n paar duisend hektaar grond wat as &#x2019;n damkomgebied vir die Bloemhofdam gere-serveer is. Dit is ook reg dat daar aan die oewers van groot damme grond gereserveer moet word om voorsiening te maak vir moontlike fluktuasies in die damme se oppervlaktes, maar ek dink ons het in die verlede te roekeloos geraak met die uitkoop van sodanige grond.</p>

<p>Namens &#x2019;n groep boere in my kiesafdeling wat my deur die distrikse landbou-unie van Wolmaransstad genader het, het ek ernstige verto&#x00EB; tot die agb. Minister gerig en hom gevra om behulpsaam te wees met die verkryging van &#x2019;n stuk grond aan die bo-ent van die Bloemhofdam se damkomgebied. Daardie boere se plase is nie groot nie. Almal is feitlik onekonomiese eenhede. As daar egter van die genoemde damkomgrond by daardie boere se plase aangesny kan word, sou hulle oor ekonomiese eenhede beskik en sou ons in die proses daarin kon slaag om die betrokke boere op hul plase te hou deurdat daar aan hulle die geleentheid gebied is om hul landbou-aktiwiteite uit te brei.</p>

<p>Die verto&#x00EB; wat ek egter tot die agb. Minister gerig het, is deur die Direkteur van Natuurbewaring in Transvaal afgeskiet. Ek weet dat as dit van die agb. Minister afge-hang het, daardie boere die grond sou gekry het. Die provinsie van Transvaal administreer tans daardie grond en is besig om in daardie gebied &#x2019;n natuurreservaat tot stand te bring. In my kiesafdeling het ek nie minder nie as vier natuurreservate wat etlike duisende hektaar beslaan. Ek neem egter glad nie genoe&#x00EB; met die feit dat daar nou &#x2019;n vyfde een moet bykom nie, en dit ten koste van die landbouer.</p>

<p>Die genoemde gebied, wat ek duidelik aan die agb. Minister uitgewys het, sal nooit &#x2019;n natuurreservaat kan word nie. Die gebied is nie geskik daarvoor nie. Eerstens is die gebied te smal. Tweedens is die gebied van so &#x2019;n aard dat die wild wat daar gevestig is, gedurende laagwatertye kan oorstap na die Vrystaatse kant van die rivier. [Tussenwerpsels.]</p>

<p>Dan gaan hulle nooit weer terug nie.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lemmer">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. A. LEMMER</person>:</from>

<p>Ja, dit is reg. Hulle sal nooit weer teruggaan nie. Derdens moet &#x2019;n mens jou afvra wat sou gebeur as daardie gebied se weiding geheel en al sou afbrand. Daar is ook tans &#x2019;n onvreetbare bos wat die gebied binnedring. Wat ook baie belangrik is, is dat al wat &#x2019;n verbode onkruid is in daardie gebied groei. Ek wil beweer dat ons darem nou al genoeg natuurreservate het. Ek dink daar is sekere mense wat sake op hierdie gebied te ver wil voer. My pa het altyd ges&#x00EA; &#x2019;n &#x201E;te&#x201D; is &#x2019;n gevaarlike ding. Hy het ges&#x00EA; daar is net twee &#x201E;te&#x2019;s&#x201D; wat goed is, die een is &#x201E;te perd&#x201D; en die ander is &#x201E;tevrede&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Ek wil nie vandag hier die natuurbe-waringsafdeling van Transvaal kritiseer nie, maar ek wil beweer dat hulle hierdie huidige skema te ver wil voer. Ons kan ons geld op ander plekke nuttiger aanwend.</p>

<p>As daardie grond tot die beskikking van aangrensende boere gestel word, kan ons die boere mos by wyse van ooreenkoms motiveer om op eie houtjie met &#x2019;n wildboerdery te begin. Tewens, verskeie boere doen dit reeds in daardie omgewing. Ons boere is lief vir ons fauna en flora, en ons sal meer vir bewaring doen as ons elke individu as sodanig kan motiveer om di&#x00E9; dinge te bewaar wat besig is om uit te sterf.</p>

<p>Indien daardie grond aan die landbou teruggegee word, sal daar geen rede wees om te vrees dat die voortbestaan van die Bloemhofdam as gevolg daarvan bedreig sou word nie. Ek kan miskien net noem dat toe die destydse Departement van Waterwese grond in die gebied moes uitkoop, hy meer grond gekoop het as wat hy werklik nodig gehad het. Die gebied was geweldig dig bevolk, en die oorgrote meerderheid van die boere daar het op klein stukkies grond geboer. Sommige van die plase was kleiner as 60 ha. Die departement het aanvanklik net in &#x2019;n gedeelte van die klein plasies belanggestel. Die gedeelte wat oorgebly het, het buite die bufferstrook gel&#x00EA;. Die boere het nie kans gesien om hul boerdery-aktiwiteite op daardie klein stukkies grond voort te sit nie. Gevolglik het elke boer die departement gevra om sy hele plaas uit te koop, wat die departement toe wel gedoen het. Hierdie optrede aan die kant van die <span class="col_897-898" refersTo="page_0476"/>departement het beslis daartoe bygedra dat grond in daardie gebied sinvol gekonsolideer is.</p>

<p>Net onderkant die genoemde stuk grond wat ek onder die aandag van die agb. Minister gebring het, het ses boere die reg verkry om hul stuk rivieroewer te behou, onderhewig aan &#x2019;n serwituut. Dit bring my direk by my versoek. Soos ek nou net aangedui het, is daar in die verlede besluit om grond wat nader aan die Bloemhofdamwal gele&#x00EB; is, vir die landbou te behou. Nadat die departement dus &#x2019;n gedeelte van die bufferstrook wat uit klein plasies bestaan, sinvol in &#x2019;n eenheid gekonsolideer het, is dit dan nie ook nou moontlik om hierdie grond onderhewig aan &#x2019;n serwituut aan die aangrensende boere te verkoop nie?</p>

<p>Ek wil afsluit deur &#x2019;n ernstige beroep op die agb. Minister te doen. Ek doen dit graag omdat ek weet dat hy baie simpatiek staan teenoor die saak wat ek hier te berde gebring het. Omdat ek ook weet dat hy nie eensydig &#x2019;n besluit oor die saak kan neem nie, vra ek hom om weer eens met die Administrateur van Transvaal te onderhandel oor die teruggawe van die grond aan die landbou.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN WATERWESE, BOSBOU EN OMGEWINGSBEWARING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, laat my eers toe om u van harte geluk te wens met die feit dat u daardie Stoel, waarin ek die voorreg gehad het om te sit, nou so goed vol sit.</p>

<p>Dit is ook my voorreg om te kan s&#x00EA; dat hoewel mnr. Sonntag, Adjunk-direk-teur-generaal belas met bosbou-aan-geleenthede, vanjaar moes aftree, hy goedgunstig daartoe ingestem het dat die Kommissie vir Administrasie sy dienstyd-perk met &#x2019;n verder jaar kon verleng. Ons is baie dankbaar om die dienste van mnr. Sonntag, wat &#x2019;n baie kundige persoon is, nog &#x2019;n jaar lank te kan behou.</p>

<p>Sedert agb. lede laas hier bymekaar was&#x2014; agb. lede sal opmerk dat ek s&#x00EA; &#x201E;agb. lede&#x201D; en nie &#x201E;ons&#x201D; nie&#x2014;het die voormalige Adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Waterwese, mnr. Hobbs, uit sy pos getree en is hy aan-gestel as voorsitter van die Randwaterraad. Hy het sy pos oor al die jare heen met onderskeiding beklee. Dit was toe daar met die bouwerk aan die Hendrik Verwoerd-dam begin is, dat ek hom die eerste keer ontmoet het toe hy die ingenieur was wat namens die Republiek van Suid-Afrika se Departement van Waterwese daar opgetree het. Mnr. Hobbs het daarna &#x2019;n besondere loopbaan in die Staatsdiens gehad, en dit is met leedwese dat ons van hom afskeid geneem het toe hy aangestel is as voorsitter van die Randwaterraad, waar hy tans ook uitstekende werk doen.</p>

<p>In sy plek het ons mnr. J. G. du Plessis aangestel wat nou Adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Waterwese is. Mnr. Du Plessis beklee ook hierdie pos met waardigheid. Hy is getroud met &#x2019;n nooi uit my ou kiesafdeling daar op die oewer van die Oranjerivier. So al die agb. lede wie se pleidooie oor die Oranjerivier gegaan het, sal ten minste weet waar die Adjunk-direkteur-generaal van Waterwese se besondere belangstelling l&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag alle agb. lede wat my so hartlik verwelkom het, hartlik bedank, &#x2019;n Besondere woord van dank ook aan my ou genant wat so liries geraak het oor die Vaalrivier en alles wat daar aan die gang is. Ek het lus gehad om aan hom te s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;You are a poet but you do not know it.&#x201D; [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons kom &#x2019;n lang pad saam, en ek is dankbaar dat hy die voorsitter is van die Regering se Waterwese-studiegroep. Ek wil ook graag ander agb. lede bedank vir hul goeie wense.</p>

<p>Voordat ek by die punte kom wat die agb. lede in die bespreking van hierdie Begrotingspos geopper het, wil ek net enkele woorde ter inleiding s&#x00EA;. Die lewenspeil van &#x2019;n bevolking is nooit staties nie, en uit die verwagte verhoogde lewenspeil wat ons nastreef, volg daar noodwendig ook &#x2019;n verhoogde per capita-waterverbruik. Met die voorafgaande uitgangspunt, word daar verwag dat die wateraanvraag ongeveer elke 23 jaar sal verdubbel. Dit is dus die taak van die departement, en in die besonder van die Direktoraat van Waterwese, om te verseker dat voldoende water van &#x2019;n goeie gehalte in &#x2019;n steeds toenemende mate beskikbaar is. Water is &#x2019;n natuurlike hulpbron wat moeilik aangevul kan word, en om in toenemende waterbehoeftes te kan voorsien, vereis die optimale benutting van ons skaars water-bronne. Suid-Afrika se re&#x00EB;nval neem skerp van oos na wes af, terwyl die verdamping maksimaal is in vlak damkomme. Dit het veral betrekking op die agb. lid vir Mooirivier se pleidooi vir damkomme ho&#x00EB;r op teen die berge. Die lae damkomme veroorsaak <span class="col_899-900" refersTo="page_0477"/>baie probleme wanneer dit kom by die ontwikkeling van hierdie skaars hulpbron, veral aangesien die verdamping so groot is in die vlak damkomme en ook toeneem in die rig-ting waarin verdamping groter is, m.a.w. van oos na wes.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Swellendam het hier gepraat van wat ek graag wil noem die water-armgebiede. Ek wil graag &#x2019;n bietjie meer intensief hierna kyk. In groot dele van die land &#x2014;en hier dink ek nie net aan besproeiings-water nie&#x2014;kan daar nie minimum standaarde vir waterbenodigdhede gehandhaaf word nie, en dit is as gevolg van gronduitputting en ook as gevolg van ontoereikende bronne. Dit is dan ook my en die departement se groot ems om aan sulke gebiede, wat as waterarmgebiede geklassifiseer kan word, &#x2019;n toereikende watervoorraad te verskaf, teen &#x2019;n tarief wat die verbruiker se voortbestaan sal kan verseker. Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil onderstreep dat dit teen tariewe geskied wat die voortbestaan van die verbruiker verseker. Ek dink ons is dit almal eens dat hierdie aangeleentheid verreikende implikasies vir die voortbestaan van groot dele van die platteland inhou. Ek is dus voornemens om binnekort &#x2019;n komitee van ondersoek aan te stel wat indringend op hierdie saak sal ingaan, veral met betrekking tot, in die eerste plek, die standaarde wat toegepas moet word by die bepaling van watervoorsienings-behoeftes in gebiede wat arm aan water is. In die tweede plek sal hierdie komitee aan-dag moet skenk aan die identifisering van waterarmgebiede wat vir buitengewone hulp sal kwalifiseer. In die derde plek moet die tariefbeleid vir sodanige gebiede, wat die bepaling van &#x2019;n maksimum tarief sal insluit, ondersoek word. In die vierde plek sal daar na moontlike vorms van hulpverlening gekyk moet word.</p>

<p>Gedagtig daaraan dat &#x2019;n toereikende watervoorraad &#x2019;n sleutelrol in die algemene gesondheid van die land se bevolking speel, sal ek my kollega, die agb. Minister van Gesondheid, Welsyn en Pensioene versoek om deur die aanwysing van &#x2019;n lid of lede van sy departement ook &#x2019;n inset in verband met die werksaamhede van die komitee te lewer. Lede van die Afdeling: Fisiese Beplanning van die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister en van die Afdeling: Kleurlingbetrekkinge van die Departement van Binnelandse Aange-leenthede sal ook by die werksaamhede van die komitee betrek word. Provinsiale Administrasies en moontlik ook ander departemente en instansies sal ook genooi word om verteenwoordigers te benoem om in hierdie komitee te dien.</p>

<p>As &#x2019;n mens in &#x2019;n gebied grootgeword het waar jy maar altyd na ietsie moes soek, en dikwels baie ernstig moes soek, om by te gooi, dan moet jy maar mooi werk met water.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pinetown het onder meer gepraat oor veral die personeelposisie, maar ook oor die finansi&#x00EB;le posisie, van die departement. Die agb. lid vir De Aar het ook van die finansi&#x00EB;le posisie gepraat. Ek sal in die loop van my toespraak na hierdie aangeleentheid verwys.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown spoke about the shortage of staff. It is true that there is a very sad shortage of staff in the Directorate of Water Affairs. The situation also applies in respect of the other directorates, but the situation in especially the Directorate of Water Affairs is of considerable concern to me. The staff position leaves much to be desired, but the department is taking steps to obtain a better service package for officials serving in the department. Certain proposals have been forwarded to the Commission for Administration. In addition, the Commission for Administration is at the moment conducting investigations into the salary structure of scientists. I hope something will materialize out of this. The department is represented on this committee of inquiry. The recruitment of staff will also be expanded to include an overseas recruitment drive and arrangements have been made to send a departmental recruitment team overseas in January 1982, just after the normal recruitment period stretching from November to January has passed.</p>

<p>As far as the report of the Advocate General is concerned, I can only say that it is an unfortunate report and I will tell hon. members why I think so. An official of the department, instead of reporting what was going on in the department to his seniors, reported it to the Advocate General. That resulted in this investigation by the Advocate General. It is indeed unfortunate that irregularities such as these are reported to the Advocate General. I can give the House the assurance that these irregularities have <span class="col_901-902" refersTo="page_0478"/>been investigated thoroughly by the department. The hon. member has said that he is very satisfied with the assistance given to the Advocate General by the department. The necessary steps have been taken to ensure that something like this will not take place again.</p>

<p>Feit van die storie is dat &#x2019;n amptenaar nie die voorskrifte van werkmetodes met betrekking tot oortyddiens nagekom het nie. Dit was die gevolg daarvan. Ek kan agb. lede die versekering gee dat ons uit ons pad sal gaan om te verhoed dat dit nie weer in die toekoms gebeur nie.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the experiment with regard to the disposal of sludge into the sea at Durban. We know that that is a very emotional subject. The Water Research Commission is extremely aware of the sensitivity of the sea environment and the importance of minimizing possible detrimental effects to it. It accordingly approaches its task with the greater responsibility. As the hon. member has mentioned, a permit was granted for two years on an experimental basis. During this time the project will be monitored regularly. I think the hon. member&#x2019;s request with regard to continuous reporting on the effects of monitoring is reasonable and I will see to it that this matter is attended to. My policy, and that of my department, is not to withhold information from the public, but to enlighten the public as far as possible about our activities. I think this is the best way of achieving something as far as environmental conservation and all other matters relating to the environment are concerned. I, therefore, think it is a reasonable request and will accede to it.</p>

<p>Ek het reeds die agb. lid vir Meyerton bedank vir die mooi woorde wat hy my toegevoeg het. Vir baie jare lank het hulle net grappies oor ons Van der Merwes gemaak, maar die agb. lid het daarop gewys dat ons Van der Merwes ten spyte van hierdie grappe darem iewers gekom het. Die agb. lid het liries geword oor die Vaalrivier en het &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer vir die bou van nog &#x2019;n dam in die Suikerbosrandrivier want al die water loop weg. Op hierdie punt moet ek van die agb. lid verskil, want die water loop nie weg nie. Dit loop ten minste nog by die Bloemhofdam in. Wat die Vaalrivier betref, het ons die stadium bereik dat dit een van die riviere in Suid-Afrika is waar water slegs in hoogs uitsonderlike gevalle nog see toe wegloop en ons feitlik al die water vergader wat in daardie rivier afloop.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Mooi River spoke about water conservation and food production, the storage of water and afforestation in the Richmond area. The building of dams in the upper reaches would be ideal were it not for the expense involved. In general rivers are very steep in mountain areas and as a result dam walls must be very high. This makes them very expensive. As far as afforestation in the vicinity of rivers are concerned, I may mention that intensive research is undertaken to provide management with the basic data required for the efficient management of catchment areas. As regards the water supply of the Richmond area, I may say that the effect of vegetation on stream banks and the effectiveness of the open strip of 20 metres are matters which are being investigated by the department. I will inform the hon. member in due course of the results of that investigation.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir De Aar het uitgewei oor water vir besproeiing en vir die landbousektor en ek wil graag iets oor hierdie onderwerp s&#x00EA;. Namate die landsekonomie met verloop van tyd geleidelik oorgegaan het van &#x2019;n boerdery-ekonomie na &#x2019;n steeds sterker wordende industri&#x00EB;le huishouding, het die Direktoraat van Waterwese ook &#x2019;n gedaanteverwisseling ondergaan. Van die ou Departement van Besproeiing het dit die Departement van Waterwese geword en het hy met die konstruksie van die OVS-goudveldskema net na die Tweede W&#x00EA;reldoorlog, die tydvak van streekswatervoorsieningskemas betree. Die besnoeiing op Staatsbesteding het ook tot gevolg gehad dat die beskikbare fondse wat vir besproeiingsontwikkeling aangewend kan word, na my mening baie na aan onvoldoende geword het. In die jare vorentoe sal ons aandag daaraan moet gee om &#x2019;n skeiding te maak tussen fondse toebedeel aan water-skemas vir nywerheids-en stedelike gebruik en di&#x00E9; ten opsigte van waterskemas vir land-boudoeleindes, sodat elk van di&#x00E9; twee groepe &#x2019;n regmatige fondsetoebedeling erlang, m.a.w., ons sien uit na &#x2019;n ware teikenbegroting.</p>

<p><span class="col_903-904" refersTo="page_0479"/>Nieteenstaande die voorafgaande sal ons fouteer indien ons aanvaar dat besproeiing tans die stiefkind is, aangesien meer as 70&#x0025; van die ontwikkelde waterbronne vandag nog vir besproeiing aangewend word. Ons moet ook nie aanvaar dat al die ontwikkelde waterbronne deur die Staat ontwikkel is nie. Hierdie water benat sowat 1,2 miljoen ha grond, waarvan 59&#x0025; deur private inisiatief ontwikkel is, 22&#x0025; deur groepe boere wat hul in besproeiingsrade georganiseer het en 19&#x0025; deur die Staat. Terwyl die Staats-en Staats-ondersteunde besproeiingskemas teen &#x2019;n jaarlikse groeikoers van sowat 1,5&#x0025; toe-geneem het, het die ooreenstemmende syfer vir die private sektor op 3,4&#x0025; te staan gekom. Die voortgesette groei in be-sproeiingsgronde in die private sektor kan slegs verseker word indien die Staat in &#x2019;n toenemende mate geld bestee aan water-werke waaruit water aan boere beskikbaar gestel kan word. Opgaarwerke soos die Hendrik Verwoerddam en grootskaalse tussen-bekkenwerke soos die Oranje-Vistonnel sal nooit deur private inisiatief aangepak word nie, en as die Staat nie werke van sulke omvang aanpak nie, sal dit noodwendig ontwikkeling strem. Ek hoop die agb. lid vir Worcester luister nou. Waar is hy?</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Dit lyk vir my hy is &#x2019;n man wat sy tyd ken. Dieselfde geld vir be-sproeiingsprojekte vir groot stukke grond soos die Plooysberg-gebied.</p>

<p>Dit is interessant om die tempo waarteen die totale besproeiingsoppervlakte die afgelope dekade en &#x2019;n half toegeneem het, naamlik 2,5&#x0025; per jaar, te vergelyk met di&#x00E9; van die bevolkingsaanwas oor dieselfde tydperk, naamlik 2,6&#x0025;. Hierdie vergelyking toon dat besproeiingsontwikkeling tans nog redelik goed tred hou met die bevolkingsaanwas. Indien die tendens van steeds afnemende Staatsbesteding aan besproeiingswerke egter verder voortduur, sal daar noodwendig ook hier &#x2019;n agterstand begin opbou. Ek moet dus die landbousektor waarsku om toe te sien dat die water wat aan hom toebedeel word, doeltreffender aangewend word. By &#x2019;n besproeiingskema waar daar &#x2019;n tekort aan water bestaan, is daar vasgestel dat met 80&#x0025; doeltreffende besproeiing die tekort 3,4 miljoen kubieke meter per jaar is. As die doeltreffendheid egter afneem en daar slegs 60&#x0025; doeltreffende aanwending van besproeiingswater is, is die tekort 29 miljoen kubieke meter per jaar. In hierdie verband kom ons dus voor &#x2019;n groot uitdaging te staan.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Nuwe ontwikkeling oor die jongste aantal jare wat interessante moontlikhede inhou, is die totstandkoming van landelike watervoorsieningskemas. In die streke Caledon en Heidelberg is meer waterskemas in aanbou vir die verspreiding van water na individuele plase vir veesuipingsdoeleindes. Die weidingspotensiaal op hierdie plase kan tans nie ten volle benut word nie weens &#x2019;n tekort aan plaaslike waterbronne. Alhoewel die eenheidskoste van die water aan hierdie plase hoog is, dui studies daarop dat die voordele wat uit die beskikbaarstelling van die water voortspruit, die koste ver oorskry.</p>

<p>Ek stem dus met die agb. lid saam en is van mening dat ons in die rigting van &#x2019;n ware teikenbegroting moet werk. Die teiken moet wees om genoeg fondse beskikbaar te h&#x00EA; vir watervoorsiening aan die landbou, die nywerhede en vir huishoudelike gebruik.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Worcester het gekla oor die water wat ons dan nou uit die Bre&#x00EB;rivier haal. Die agb. lid is egter nie billik nie en moes ook aan ons vertel het wat in die Bre&#x00EB;rivier aan die gang is. Daar word &#x2019;n groot dam in die Bre&#x00EB;rivier gebou, naamlik die Groter Brandvleidam naby die agb. lid se plaas. Die totale koste daaraan verbonde sal ongeveer R40 miljoen wees. Die doel van hierdie skema is om gedurende die dro&#x00EB; somermaande &#x2019;n groter voorraad water vir besproeiing langs die Bre&#x00EB;rivier beskikbaar te stel. Tans word sowat 11 800 ha besproei, terwyl met die vergrote dam die oppervlakte onder besproeiing tot 35 000 ha vergroot kan word. Aanvullende water word ook benodig om die brakprobleme te bekamp wat tans in die rivier bestaan. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, het die agb. lid nie die hele storie vertel nie, maar dit is sy goeie reg om te keer vir wat sy eie is. As ons egter die beleid sou volg dat water nie van een gebied oor die waterskeiding na &#x2019;n ander gebied geneem kan word nie, wil ek vir agb. lede &#x2019;n paar gevolge hiervan opnoem.</p>

<p>As ons hierdie beleid gevolg het, sou die Staat nie Sasol 2 of Sasol 3 kon bou nie, want daar is nie water in daardie gebiede nie. Water moes oor die waterskeiding <span class="col_905-906" refersTo="page_0480"/>gepomp word. Dan kon ons ook nie &#x2019;n Oranje-Vistonnel bou nie en dele van Kaapland langs die Vis-en Sondagsriviere van water voorsien nie. Die taak, die plig van die Direktoraat van Waterwese is dus om te sorg dat almal water kry en om te sorg dat die watervoorraad so regverdig moontlik oor die hele Suid-Afrika versprei word.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. lid vir Worcester ook gerusstel. Die ingenieurs wat betrokke was by die Elandsriviertonnel moet met hulle prestasie gelukgewens word. Die Departement van Vervoer het &#x2019;n tonnel gebou en as iemand ooit &#x2019;n ingewing gehad het dan was dit die man wat toe aan &#x2019;n baie goeie plan gedink het. Hy het voorgestel dat water deur die tonnel na die Bergriviervallei gebring word en die pad bo-oor die waterleiding gebou word. Dit sou vir die mense aan die Kaapstad-en Bergrivier kant van groot nut wees. Ek dink dit was &#x2019;n groot prestasie om hierdie water te laat aansluit by die water van die Theewaterskloofskema. Selfs na hierdie uitkeer van water, word daar genoeg water in die Bre&#x00EB;rivier oorgelaat om vir die verdubbeling van die reeds bestaande be-sproeiingsoppervlakte langs die Bre&#x00EB;rivier voorsiening te maak. Hierdie ontwikkeling kan oor die volgende 50 jaar geskied. Dan is daar ook nog genoeg water vir &#x2019;n stad vier maal die grootte van die huidige Worcester. Dan is daar ook nog &#x2019;n reserwe water oor. As Worcester uiteindelik nie vier maal nie maar tien maal sy huidige grootte word, gee ek die mense van daardie tyd die reg om te s&#x00EA; dat die destydse Minister van Waterwese ges&#x00EA; het dat as Worcester so groot word hulle weer die water uit die Elandsrivier kan terugkry.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Wynberg, I do not know whether I will one day be famous or whether it is due to my good administration, as he suggested but I can say that the Swaziland Government has agreed to the filling of the Pongolapoort Dam and that this process will start on 1 January 1982. This water will be reserved for irrigation purposes.</p>

<p>Ek weet nie of die agb. lid by sy standpunt gaan hou nie, maar hy het ges&#x00EA; dat ons elke skema moet laat betaal vir sy eie water. Hy het ook &#x2019;n pleidooi gelewer vir water uit die Theewaterskloofdam en uit die Simonsbergkanaal. Ek wil nie &#x2019;n voorspelling waag nie, maar as ek aan die agb. lid se versoek voldoen, dink ek hy kan daaraan begin dink om tot R1 000 per ha vir water te betaal. Ek wil liewers s&#x00EA; dat ons die aangeleentheid daar sal laat. Ek het &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek oor die kwessie van water vir landboudoel-eindes aangestel onder die voorsitterskap van mnr. Claassens wat vandag hier teen-woordig is. Hierdie kommissie het oor die hele land getuienis aangehoor en ek verwag die uitslag van daardie ondersoek binnekort.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Schweizer-Reneke het gepraat oor damkomgebiede. Ek dink dit is nodig dat ek net kortliks verduidelik hoe daar met die damkomgebiede te werk gegaan word. Uit die aard van die saak sal agb. lede besef dat waar grond vir die bou van &#x2019;n dam uitgekoop word, meer grond gekoop word as wat werklik nodig is wat onder water of vir veiligheidsdoeleindes bokant die hoogwaterlyn nodig is. Die rede waarom dit gedoen word, is omdat daar gepoog word om nie onekonomiese eenhede oor te laat wanneer dele van plase in beslag geneem word nie. Die gevolg hiervan is dat daar mettertyd heelwat grond beskikbaar word in die damkomme wat op die een of ander wyse gebruik moet word. Die grondslag waarop daar oor hierdie grond besluit word, is soos volg. Die Beplanningsad-viesraad van die Eerste Minister het &#x2019;n hulp-komitee wat die omstandighede by elkeen van hierdie damkomme ondersoek. Nadat hierdie deskundige komitee aanbevelings gedoen het oor wat met die grond gemaak kan word, moet die gegewens aan verskeie departement voorgel&#x00EA; word. As daar groot stukke grond beskikbaar is, word dit baie dikwels weer in plase opgesny en aan boere gegee. Dit is byvoorbeeld op groot skaal gedoen in die damkomgebied by die Hendrik Verwoerddam. Andersins besluit die komitee miskien om die grond aan sekere departemente oor te dra. Die mense wat gewoonlik daarin belangstel, is die provin-siale administrasies in wie se gebied sulke grond val. Die provinsiale rade gebruik dan hierdie damkomgronde vir ontspanningsdoel-eindes, vir natuurreservate of vir een of ander bewaringsdoeleinde. Dit is presies wat gebeur het in die geval van die Bloemhof-dam waarna die agb. lid verwys het. Nadat die komitee hierdie geval ondersoek het, het hulle so &#x2019;n aanbeveling gedoen. Die Beplanningsadviesraad <span class="col_907-908" refersTo="page_0481"/>besluit oor die benutting van die grond en die Departement van Gemeenskapsontwikkeling voer dan die besluit uit. In hierdie geval is die grond oor-gedra na die Transvaalse Provinsiale Ad-ministrasie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het verto&#x00EB; in hierdie verband gerig en die departement het na aanleiding daarvan by die Transvaalse Provinsiale Administrasie navraag gedoen. Hierdie provinsiale administrasie het te kenne gegee dat hulle nog steeds in die grond belangstel en dat hulle dit wil benut. Die agb. lid het nou weer sy saak gestel en die beste wat ek vir hom kan doen, is om sy verdere verto&#x00EB; onder die aandag van die betrokke provinsiale administrasie te bring. Die agb. lid sal egter besef dat ek nie oor daardie grond kan besluit nie. Tensy die provinsiale administrasie aandui dat hulle dit nie meer nodig het nie, sal die grond nie weer die eiendom van die departement word nie, behalwe as ek sou besluit om die Bloemhofdam se wal ho&#x00EB;r te maak, en ek meen nie dat dit voor die jaar 2500 sal gebeur nie.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek meen ek het nou min of meer op al die vrae geantwoord wat agb. lede tot dusver aan my gestel het.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. E. J. VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I request the privilege of the second half-hour.</p>

<p>It was difficult to establish the connection between a medical practitioner and the job of Minister of Water Affairs until the hon. member for Meyerton had spoken and had described the large volume of water which passes through the average human being. Then I remembered that urology was in fact part of the stock in trade of a medical practitioner and I could see that there is some justification for the present Minister to fulfil his present responsibility.</p>

<p>On behalf of the PFP I should like to congratulate the new Minister on his appointment and to welcome him to this position. I want to talk about the environment and say that since 1974 I have done nothing else but congratulate new Ministers to this post. Without in any way reflecting on the present Minister, I should like to say very pertinently that that is one thing that is wrong with this particular department, viz. the fact that it has not been left for a sufficiently long period of time in the hands of a single Minister to allow him to do something really effective about it. It seems to be an apprenticeship for Ministers and it seems to be a department which is given to Ministers from time to time as an ancillary of some other department and clearly as an afterthought, rather than giving to it the very important status that it should have.</p>

<p>We have over the years made very little progress indeed in regard to the protection of the environment in South Africa. In fact, there are innumerable examples of neglect of the environment, of irreparable damage and a sense of irresponsibility which have caused a great deal of deeply felt concern in many spheres of the South African society. I would also like to say pertinently that we will make no progress as far as the protection of our environment is concerned until such time as we start understanding what our environment is all about and start taking really effective steps to protect that environment. I do not want to refer to the commission which is sitting at the moment of which I am a member and I will leave that aspect entirely out of the discussion. However, I would like to deal with a few things which I would like to bring to the attention of this hon. Minister with all the emphasis at my command and I hope that he will really do something effective about it.</p>

<p>Our environment is our total surroundings. Our environment is the air that we breathe and which we must continue to breathe, therefore it must remain clean and healthy. The water that we drink is the very foundation of a successful technological state and a healthy society. It is the soil, that limited, irreplaceable resource, that feeds us.</p>

<p>As ons nie voedsel kan produseer nie kan ons nog in die eerste deel nog in die tweede deel van die Wet van Transvaal voorsien.</p>

<p>It is the resources of our society which is the foundation of the economic prosperity of our country. It is the foundation of our stability and our security. It is our developed environment, which the hon. member for Maitland refers to as our built-in environment, our homes, towns, schools and recreation. Indeed, it is everything that surrounds us, every aspect of our surroundings which we occupy, use or need for our existence. <span class="col_909-910" refersTo="page_0482"/>Our environment determines in the short term our prosperity in terms of its judicious use. However, in the long term, which is far more important, it will determine our prosperity and our happiness in terms of its enlightened conservation. These resources which are largely irreplaceable and are going to be in short supply, will become more valuable and more vital as we go along. It will require the utmost care in its preservation. I think the environment in South Africa must be recognized as an all-embracing concept. It is not just the concern of the ladies at the bridge club, or some cranks writing articles in newspapers and magazines. It really is the most important consideration and concern of the enlightened citizens of our country and it should also be one of the most important concerns of our Government. Marxism or the Broederbond and the NP, depending on which way one looks at it, may be the greatest danger facing our society, but I believe&#x2014;and I really and honestly do&#x2014;that the preservation of our environment is by far the most important responsibility that we have to our country and to the future generations. It has been ineffectual to date due to the lack of status that it occupies and due to its dispersed nature. I received a document the other day on the commission which states that the conservation of natural resources is controlled by at least eight Acts. Wild life conservation, on the other hand, is controlled by two Acts and innumerable ordinances. Environmental pollution is controlled by 13 Acts and a large number of ordinances. Finally, land use planning is controlled by at least one Act and, as far as the local authorities are concerned, there are by-laws as well. All these activities are components of the use or the conservation of the environment and not the other way around. The environment must not be seen as an afterthought to be added to each one of these activities controlled by those Acts and ordinances. I believe that in the final analysis we will only make progress when there is a single and powerful department exercising over-all planning and coordination of the activities of all the bodies, departments and organizations that are involved with the use or the preservation of the environment.</p>

<p>I am not talking of the final administrative work that must be done, or the detail, but about the central planning and coordination. It will have to be an integral part of the planning function of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s department. It should not be relegated to a Government department of lesser influence and importance. It should not be an ancillary part of any particular department. It should, in fact, be the central planning and co-ordinating authority. I can mention hundreds of examples of the total failure of our society in terms of the preservation of the environment in one way or another due to the reasons I have mentioned. Because of the lack of time I would like to refer to just one. I am going to refer to soil erosion and it may be said that that is part of the department of Agriculture and Fisheries. However, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries has conflicting interests in this respect. There is not a single department to monitor its activities and tell them, should the need arise, that they are not doing what they should be doing.</p>

<p>Mnr. J. P. van der Merwe, die voormalige Direkteur van Grondbewaring, wat onlangs afgetree het, het na sy aftrede &#x2019;n baie belang-rike en insiggewende brief geskryf. Hy het ges&#x00EA;&#x2014;en ek wil dit vandag hier boekstaaf &#x2014;dat daar jaarliks nog steeds tussen 233 en 363 miljoen ton kosbare landbougrond in hierdie land wegspoel. As &#x2019;n mens daardie grond in sewe-ton vragmotors laai, sal jy &#x2019;n string vragmotors h&#x00EA; wat buffer teen buffer meer as sewe keer om die aarde strek. As &#x2019;n mens die stikstof, fosfor en potas wat jaarliks deur ons riviere weggevoer word, deur gewone kunsmis moet vervang, sal dit bykans R1 biljoen kos. Die skrywer van hierdie brief is nie &#x2019;n lid van my party nie, maar die voormalige Direkteur van Grondbewaring in Suid-Afrika. Die Regering slaap dus en doen niks aan hierdie groot probleemnie. Mnr. Van der Merwe skryf ook dat die subsidies op grondbewaringswerke van R7,2 miljoen in 1978 tot net R2,5 miljoen in 1979 gedaal het. Hy s&#x00EA; voorts dat ons die mees suksesvolle uitbuiters van alles, veral van ons natuurlike hulpbronne, ongeag of dit die lug, die water, planete, diere, ons min onvervangbare grond of selfs ons medemens is. Ek wil herhaal, mnr. die Voorsitter, die Regering slaap en doen niks. Mnr. Van der Merwe s&#x00EA; ook dat die Veldtrust se vlerke gou geknip is omdat hy op tone sou trap as <span class="col_911-912" refersTo="page_0483"/>hy op dringende optrede sou aandring. Dit sou impliseer dat daar iewers gefouteer is. En nog meer: Geen bestuurder op enige vlak, land, ko&#x00F6;perasie, boerevereniging of wat ook al, wat verkies is of word, sal &#x00EA; of doen wat by sy kiesers ongewild is nie. Sy opposisie sal dit gewetenloos uitbuit. Nou s&#x00EA; en doen hy liewer niks wat aanstoot kan gee nie. Ek s&#x00EA; weer: Die Regering slaap en doen niks aan hierdie geweldige probleemnie. Mnr. Van der Merwe s&#x00EA; voorts dat grondbe-waring so ook die slagoffer van ons bestel geword het. Weens die delikate balans wat daar by geleentheid tussen Regering en Opposisiepartye was, en omdat die plattelandse setels bepaal het watter party &#x2019;n verkiesing sou wen, is daar teruggedeins om volgens die vereistes van grondbewaring op te tree en is hulpskemas aangebied wat nie wetenskaplik onderleg was nie. Hy s&#x00EA; ook die volgende: &#x201E;Hoe dikwels moes ek aanhoor dat ek nie uit die oog moet verloor dat die Minister eers &#x2019;n politieke verantwoorde-likheid het nie.&#x201D; Ek s&#x00EA; weer, mnr. die Voorsitter: Die Regering slaap en doen niks aan hierdie geweldige probleemnie.</p>

<p>Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, is daardie brief geskryf deur &#x2019;n voormalige Direkteur van Grondbewaring. Ek wil egter ook aanhaal uit die laaste deel van sy brief&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sedert die eerste Grondbewaringswet van 1945 tot vandag toe s&#x00EA; ons moenie dwing nie, voed op; moenie straf nie, gee &#x2019;n lang, opgeskorte vonnis; as hy di&#x00E9; wat hy het nie volgens bewaringsbeginsels ekonomies kan ontgin nie, gee hom meer grond; as hy nie werk uit eie sak kan bekostig nie, gee hom subsidies; as hy die orige bietjie nie kan bekostig nie, gee hom lae rentekoerslenings op langtermyn. As hy nie weet hoe nie, gee die tegniese advies gratis.<br/>Red nou so &#x2019;n situasie! Ek kon nie.</block>

<p>Die situasie wat ons in Suid-Afrika het, is sodanig dat &#x2019;n amptenaar nie iets wat hom pla in die openbaar kan s&#x00EA; totdat hy die dag aftree nie. &#x2019;n Regering, &#x2019;n volk en &#x2019;n land wat slaap en niks doen terwyl sy grond in die see spoel nie&#x2014;grond wat onvervangbaar is en die fondament van sy voortbestaan is omdat &#x2019;n mens grond nodig het om voedsel te produseer&#x2014;het nie die reg om homself te beroep op &#x2019;n toekoms nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Minister vra dat hy tog in Vadersnaam, en ook in die naam van ons land en ons volk, iets daadwerklik aan hierdie problemsal doen.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. M. VAN A. DE JAGER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Bryanston sal my vergeef dat ek hom nie volg op sy pad na die see saam met die grond wat in die rivier afspoel nie.</p>

<p>Ek is &#x2019;n baie gelukkige mens want nadat ek na die agb. Minister en die agb. lid vir Meyerton geluister het, het ek besef dat &#x2019;n broer van my met &#x2019;n Van der Merwe getroud is en ek meen daar was &#x00EA;rens &#x2019;n niggie wat ook met &#x2019;n Van der Merwe getroud is. Ek kan dus nou vanaand huis toe gaan en vir my vrou gaan s&#x00EA;: Welgeluksalig is ons wat sit in die kring van die Van der Merwes, al is dit maar ook op die periferie.</p>

<p>Met inagneming van alle tersake faktore soos verdamping en insinking, is volgens huidige kennis en berekening, die maksimum hoeveelheid varswater uit natuurlike bronne, bogronds en ondergronds, wat beskikbaar gemaak kan word vir die Republiek van Suid-Afrika, 22 130 miljoen kubieke meter. Aan die ander kant word volgens berekening die volgende gebruikspatroon teen die einde van die eeu verwag. Die landbou sal 12 420 miljoen kubieke meter water jaarliks benodig terwyl die stede, nywerhede en myne na verwagting 16 425 miljoen kubieke meter water jaarliks sal nodig h&#x00EA;. Indien hierdie verbruiksyfer vergelyk word met die maksimum hoeveelheid water wat jaarliks beskikbaar gestel kan word, is daar &#x2019;n verwagte tekort van 6 715 miljoen kubieke meter water wat gelyk is aan &#x2019;n tekort van 23&#x0025;. Daar word &#x2019;n hele reeks metodes aan die hand gedoen om die verwagte tekort van 23&#x0025; aan varswater te oorbrug. Weens &#x2019;n gebrek aan tyd kan ek nie oor elkeen van die aanbevole metodes uitwei nie en wil ek myself slegs bepaal by die besparingsmetodes wat aangewend kan word in die landbou en meer bepaald by besproeiingsboerdery. By besproeiingsboerdery moet die ideaal steeds bly om die optimale oesopbrengs per watereenheid toegedien, te verseker. Ewe belangrik, met die oog op besparing, moet die maksimum oesopbrengs geskied teen die minimum waterverbruik. Indien ons na die bestaande metodes van besproeiing kyk, kan ons eers kyk na die tradisionele <span class="col_913-914" refersTo="page_0484"/>wyse van besproeiing wat bekend staan as vloedbesproeiing. Die land word verdeel in akkers of beddings en natgelei met &#x2019;n stroom water uit &#x2019;n leivoor of &#x2019;n kanaal wat sy oorsprong in &#x2019;n opgaardam het. Hierdie metode van besproeiing, hoewel baie oud, het sy beperkings en kan byvoorbeeld nie toegepas word op gronde wat te skuins is nie. Ander nadele van hierdie vorm van besproeiing is dat lang leivore soms aangel&#x00EA; moet word waar groot hoeveelhede water kan wegsyfer. Tweedens is dit moeilik om die juiste hoeveelheid water wat toegedien word, te bepaal. Verder vind vermorsing ook plaas indien die water nie vroegtydig uit die akker weggekeer word na die volgende bedding nie en beddings kan dus oorstroom, veral aan die onderend. Aan die ander kant, hou vloedbesproeiing di&#x00E9; voordeel in dat dit &#x2019;n oormaat van soute wat in die grond aanwesig mag wees, kan uitdreineer of uitloog. Die grootste nadeel van vloedbesproeiing is dat veral in tye van sogenaamde hittegolwe die gewas op die land blootgestel word aan droogteskokke, die uitwerking waarvan moeilik bepaalbaar is. Dit is begryplik dat waar &#x2019;n mens die akkers moet natlei met &#x2019;n stroom water, &#x2019;n mens nie onmiddellik &#x2019;n oppervlakte van 30 ha kan natlei wanneer dit werklik nodig is wanneer &#x2019;n hittegolf ondervind word nie. Deur die eie ervaring van die boer en ook deur intensiewe voorligting&#x2014;en ons is baie dankbaar vir dit wat gedoen word op die gebied van navorsing&#x2014;word tog goeie resultate met vloedbesproeiing behaal sodat &#x2019;n oesopbrengs van selfs 80&#x0025; per eenheid water verseker word.</p>

<p>Een van die ander metodes van besproeiing is sprinkelbesproeiing wat te doen het met &#x2019;n stelsel van ligte pype wat bogronds in die land gel&#x00EA; word en waar die water dan deur sproeiers gedwing word. Hierdie pype moet met die hand versit word. Verder is daar die drupbesproeiingsmetode en volgens hierdie stelsel word pype gel&#x00EA; en drup die water slegs in die omgewing van &#x2019;n boom of &#x2019;n plant. Die heel nuutste metode van sprinkelbesproeiing is &#x2019;n gemeganiseerde stelsel bekend as die spilpuntstelsel. By hierdie stelsel word gebruik gemaak van krag, elektries of masjienaangedrewe, vir die beweging van die pype met die verskillende sproeiers. Dit wil voorkom asof die oesopbrengs per eenheid water ho&#x00EB;r is by sprinkelbesproeiing as by vloedbesproeiing. Dit is ook interessant dat in Isra&#x00EB;l waar &#x2019;n ernstige tekort aan water ondervind word, baie min vloedbesproeiing toegepas word en hoofsaaklik staatgemaak word op drupbesproeiing en sprinkelbesproeiing.</p>

<p>Dit is so dat die Staat met die oog op die besparing van water die bou van sementop-gaardamme subsidieer. Waar pype gel&#x00EA; word in die plek van vore, word dit ook gesubsi-dieer. Die sementering van leivore word ook gesubsidieer en ook sprinkelbesproeiing word gesubsidieer. Hiervoor is daar groot dankbaarheid by ons boere want dit alles help mee om water te bespaar.</p>

<p>Ons het egter hier &#x2019;n problemen ons sal dit baie hoog waardeer indien die agb. Minister sal kyk na die moontlikheid om die maksimum subsidie op die bou van damme, vore en kanale asook die l&#x00EA; van pype te verhoog veral met die oog op die stygende koste van die sementering van damme en kanale. Daar is egter ook &#x2019;n ander probleemwat ek onder die aandag van die agb. Minister wil bring en dit is ten opsigte van die subsidi&#x00EB;ring van sprinkelbesproeiingstelsels. Tans is die maksimum bedrag wat per eenheid toegeken word vir so &#x2019;n spilpuntstelsel R7 500. In die geval van &#x2019;n boer wat vier eenhede het&#x2014;dus oor vier plase beskik&#x2014;het hy &#x2019;n keuse. Indien hy &#x2019;n eenheid op elke plaas aanbring, is hy uiteindelik geregtig op &#x2019;n subsidie van R30 000. As hy egter die vier plase as &#x2019;n eenheid besproei, kwalifiseer hy vir &#x2019;n subsidie van slegs R7 500. Daar is ook egter &#x2019;n ander interessante situasie. Indien &#x2019;n vader en drie seuns op vier plase boer terwyl hulle een bankrekening het waarin die geld van die boerderybedrywighede gestort word, en hulle&#x2014;net soos in die geval van die enkele boer wat vier plase het&#x2014;bring slegs een spilpuntstelsel aan wat die vier plase bedien, kwalifiseer hulle vir &#x2019;n subsidie van R30 000.

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. D. CONRADIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag vandag by die agb. Minister en sy departement &#x2019;n lansie breek vir ho&#x00EB;r voorkeur ten opsigte van &#x2019;n skema waarmee water vanuit die Oranjerivier na die Sondagsrivier geneem word vir be-sproeiingsdoeleindes. Dit wil my voorkom asof dit nie juis vir my nodig sal wees om op my knie&#x00EB; te gaan om die pleidooi te lewer nie want volgens &#x2019;n verslag onderteken deur <span class="col_915-916" refersTo="page_0485"/>die Voorsitter van die Sondagsrivierbe-sproeiingsraad wat ek vanoggend ontvang het, blyk dit dat die agb. Minister reeds op 28 November 1980 &#x2019;n afvaardiging van die raad te woord gestaan het. Na aanleiding van hierdie ontmoeting rapporteer die voorsitter die volgende&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Weer eens is die versekering gegee dat die skema voorrang geniet en dat die nodige werke gedoen sal word sodra voldoende fondse daarvoor deur die Tesourie beskikbaar gestel word.</block>

<p>Dit lyk dus asof die gesindheid in Pretoria gunstig is, maar ek wil ook daarop wys dat hierdie saak in &#x2019;n wyer konteks van aktuele belang is. Hoewel dit &#x2019;n skema is wat prim&#x00EA;r in belang van en tot voordeel van die vallei is wat deel van my kiesafdeling uitmaak, is dit van groot betekenis vir die hele Oos-Kaapland, veral vir Port Elizabeth en sy hinterland en meer bepaald vir die Port Eliza-beth/Despatch/Uitenhage metropolitaanse kompleks. Ons in Oos-Kaapland sien die uitbreiding van die skema as een van die moontlike metodes om die ekonomie van Port Elizabeth en omgewing te stimuleer. Almal van ons in Oos-Kaapland&#x2014;as ek &#x201E;almal&#x201D; s&#x00EA; bedoel ek eintlik openbare verteenwoordigers en ander gemeenskapsleiers, die plaaslike owerhede en die georganiseerde nywerheid en handel&#x2014;is op die oomblik behep met die noodsaaklikheid van sulke stimulante en maatre&#x00EB;ls wat kan dien as prikkeling tot ekonomiese ontwikkeling in daardie gebied. Ons is pynlik bewus van die gebied se agterstand en van sy ongunstige posisie in vergelyking met ander plekke waar nywerhede in die land gekonsentreer is. Die gevolg is dat ons geneig is om na elke strooitjie te gryp wat enigsins kan help om &#x2019;n ekonomiese oplewing te bewerkstellig. Dit is so dat die Sondagsriviervallei &#x2019;n aangewese fokuspunt is vir ontwikkeling wat &#x2019;n betekenisvolle inspuiting kan beteken vir die ekonomie van die hele gebied en wel vanwe&#x00EB; sy inherente landboupotensiaal en sy skake-ling met die Oranjerivier-projek. Water uit die Oranjerivier wat reeds beskikbaar is, het destyds vir die Vallei beslis &#x2019;n nuwe lewenstog verseker. Die beplande uitbreiding van die skema sal &#x2019;n voller ontplooiing van die streek se potensiaal moontlik maak. Bowendien sal dit dien as &#x2019;n belangrike stimulant vir die ekonomie van die hele gebied asook Port Elizabeth en die hinterland. Uit &#x2019;n nasionale oogpunt gesien moet die verdere ontwikkeling van die Vallei se potensiaal ook nie onderskat word nie, maar na waarde geskat word. Dit word byvoorbeeld gesag-hebbend bereken dat indien die hele potensiaal van die Sondagsriviervallei ontwikkel sou word met behulp van meer water uit die Oranjerivier, d.w.s. sowel die Addo-Barkly-brug-gebied en die Kenkelbos omgewing, die bruto landbou-opbrengs van die Vallei met R34 miljoen per jaar verhoog kan word. Dit beteken &#x2019;n toename van 20&#x0025; van die totale landbou-opbrengs van die groter Algoabaaigebied en die hinterland.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag vir die agb. Minister en sy departement op &#x2019;n paar interessante stukkies statistiek wys. Die posisie is dat 13&#x0025; van die land se totale sitrusproduksie van die Sondagsriviervallei afkomstig is. Die bruto waarde van hierdie produksie&#x2014;die jongste syfer waaroor ek beskik is di&#x00E9; ten opsigte van 1977&#x2014;beloop R22 miljoen. Sitrusvrugte van &#x2019;n baie goeie gehalte word daar gepro-duseer en die gebied is veral bekend vir sy nawellemoene. Dit is ook belangrik om daarop te let dat die bemarkingstyd van die gebied se produkte omtrent ses weke later is as in Transvaal en Natal en dit beteken &#x2019;n aansienlike verlenging van die seisoen, en dit is veral belangrik vir die oorsese mark. Sitrusvrugte van die Vallei het ook di&#x00E9; be-sondere kenmerk en voordeel dat dit na Japan uitgevoer kan word weens die afwesig-heid van die sogenaamde swartvleksiekte, &#x2019;n swamsiekte wat di&#x00E9; vrugte aanval. Omdat vrugte uit Transvaal en Natal nie vry daarvan is nie, kan dit nie na Japan uitgevoer word nie. Die vrugte is ook vry van vergroening vanwe&#x00EB; streng wetenskaplike voor-sorgmaatre&#x00EB;ls wat deur die voormalige Departement van Landbou Tegniese Dienste getref is. Die Sitrusbeurs is gretig dat hierdie uitbreiding moet plaasvind omdat die beurs te kampe het met oorsese markte waar daar &#x2019;n aanvraag bestaan vir die hoeveelheid nawellemoene wat op 3 000 tot 4 000 ha gekweek kan word. Die Departement van Landbou en Visserye is ook gereed om hulp aan te bied, tegnies en andersins, om hierdie uitbreiding moontlik te maak sodat die Vallei tot sy volle potensiaal kan ontwikkel. As ons hierdie behoefte sien, moet ons aan die agb. Minister en sy departement s&#x00EA; dat die departement <span class="col_917-918" refersTo="page_0486"/>van Waterwese die sleutel tot daardie ontwikkeling het. Dit is binne die departement se vermo&#x00EB; om verbeeldingryke ontwikkeling daar van stapel te stuur. Op die oomblik word vier pompe by Wellington Grove se keerwal gebruik om water na die Skoenmakersrivier wat in die Mentzmeer loop, te pomp, maar die kapasiteit is slegs 4 kumek. Die beplande verhoging van die keerwal sal &#x2019;n vry-stroomvloei van 26 kumek bewerkstellig. Dit gaan die Mentzmeer in, wat dan die potensi&#x00EB;le sitrusproduksie aan-sienlik sal laat toeneem.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is moontlik dat ons die skema kan help finansier deur waterregte aan die nuwe gebiede wat onder besproeiing kan kom, te verkoop deur middel van eenmalige kapitale bydraes. Ek dink dit sal ook billik wees om selfs die eiendomme wat reeds onder besproeiing is, vir &#x2019;n eenmalige kapitale bydrae aan te slaan, wat natuurlik kleiner sal wees as di&#x00E9; vir die nuwe gebiede. Ek dink dit kan stellig geregverdig word. Dit sal in elk geval die hele gebied &#x2019;n geweldige stoot vorentoe gee.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Belangrike aspek waarop ek ook wil wys, is dat daar hoegenaamd geen twyfel kan wees oor die lewensvatbaarheid van die skema nie. Die bestaande skema het homself reeds terde&#x00EB; bewys en dit word algemeen erken&#x2014;en dit is op wetenskaplike analises gebasseer&#x2014;dat van al die besproeiingskemas wat met die Oranjerivierprojek in verband staan, die Sondagsrivierskema die skema is met die beste koste-voordele-verhouding. Ek dink dit is &#x2019;n belangrike feit wat ons in aanmerking kan neem. Wanneer ons voorkeurbehandeling bepleit, dink ek dat ons &#x2019;n goeie saak het as daar van hierdie feite kennis geneem word. Volgens getuienis in die verslag van die besproeiingsraad waarna ek verwys het, word die ho&#x00EB; voorkeur wat hierdie skema verdien, reeds erken en is dit net &#x2019;n kwessie van die bewilliging van fondse. Ek wil die agb. Minister versoek om sy invloed te gebruik om vir ons die hoogste moontlike voorkeur vir hierdie skema te verkry.</p>

<p>Ons het reeds 9 400 ha onder besproeiing waarvan 6 500 ha vir sitrus en 1 800 ha vir lusern gebruik word. Dit is moontlik om met die bestaande kanale &#x2019;n bykomende 2 000 tot 3 000 ha onder besproeiing te plaas. Indien die kanaalstelsel uitgebrei word, is daar nog 5 000 ha in die omgewing van Addo/Barklybrug wat van die allerbeste potensi&#x00EB;le sitrusgrond is en wat dan onder besproeiing kan kom. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. B. GOODALL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is not my intention to respond to the hon. member for Sundays River, because I should like to raise a different subject with the hon. the Minister. At present 7,5&#x0025; of the land area of South Africa is being conserved, 5&#x0025; by the provinces and 2,5&#x0025; by the National Parks Board. This is below the minimum of 10&#x0025; recommended by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Indeed, despite the magnificent heritage of South Africa, we trail when it comes to conservation. Botswana, for example, has set aside 14&#x0025; of its land area for conservation. South Africa has two national parks larger than 100 000 ha while a small densely populated country like Japan has eight national parks larger than 100 000 ha. It is therefore essential that we take measures to preserve what we have.</p>

<p>I should therefore like to raise today the question of mining in the northern area of the Kruger National Park. Let me add that I believe that the Kruger National Park is too important to be made into a political football. The northern region of the Kruger National Park, and particularly the Pafuri area, is perhaps the most exciting area of the park, because it is the meeting point of 23 biogeographic centres, namely 9 major African ecosystems and 14 local geographic centres. This makes it unique not only in Southern Africa but perhaps also in the world.</p>

<p>It is an area of spectacular scenery. It is here that one finds in one region vast lava planes contrasted with high ridges and the dramatic gorges of the Levubu river. It is an area that is not often visited by people in the Kruger National Park and therefore it has not had the recognition that it should have. It is here where elements from desert, savanna, moist savanna thicket, tropical dry forest, equitorial forest, afro-temporate forest, tropical flood plane, wetlands and rock-outcrop communities meet. It is in this area that one finds plant communities that are not found elsewhere in the country. Examples are the Lebombo ironwood forests, high mopani woodlands, baobab forests and extensive areas of big timber riverine woodlands.</p>

<p><span class="col_919-920" refersTo="page_0487"/>As one can anticipate from the unique situation of this area, there is a magnificent variety of plant and animal species. Indeed, experts tell me that this area has the richest variety of flora and fauna found in the Kruger National Park. Moreover, there are many plant and animal species which are unique to this area. If one looks just at the Pafuri area, one finds that there are two fish, one frog, five reptile, seven bird and five mammal species which exist here and are found nowhere else in the country. These include, amongst others, the lung fish, the long-tailed starling and the Sharp&#x2019;s or tropical grysbok.</p>

<p>If one looks at the northern region of the Kruger National Park stretching in a triangle from Pafuri to Punda Milia in the south west and Wambiya in the south east, one finds that there are 33 trees, 5 fishes, 3 frogs, 16 reptiles, 50 birds and 12 mammals which exist in this area and which are found nowhere else in South Africa. This area is also of rich archaeological interest. Here one finds old Stone-Age instruments of bygone cultures. At Makahane there are the remains of buildings similar to those found at the Zimbabwe ruins. In 1979 Bushman paintings were also discovered in this area.</p>

<p>There is another reason why it is vitally important that this area should be conserved. There is a tendency to believe that, if we prevent animals from becoming extinct, we have then fulfilled our obligation as far as conservation is concerned. There is, however, a more vital requirement, namely the maintenance of the total ecological system in a region. Too often we find that man has interfered with nature and upset a very delicate ecological balance. This area of the Kruger National Park is in this context of vital and critical importance, because it is a resource bank or a natural factory. Today, despite all our progress in science, we actually know very little about how natural ecological systems operate. This area is a living laboratory which allows us to study natural evolutionary change. The benefit of this to mankind is great, because there are few such areas left where we can study the change brought about by nature as distinct from the change brought about by man. In other words, what we find here is a living laboratory which can teach us to come to terms with our environment.</p>

<p>Specialists in the field of environmental studies tell us that to mine this area could destroy not only the ecological balance in this region but could also affect other regions of the Kruger National Park. Mining would require the development of an infrastructure. This would mean railway lines, water pipes, power lines, roads and ventilation. I think all hon. members will agree that a mining complex is not an attractive site, although it is an important one. Mining could lead to the pollution of the Levubu River as well as to air pollution. Mining could affect the water table of this area since the water supply of the region is a delicate system of perennial fountains which lie directly in the path of the proposed area to be mined.</p>

<p>Nobody is saying that the interests of Iscor are not important. We all know that the production of steel is important and one can appreciate that Iscor is vitally concerned with the need to find suitable coking coal to replace the diminishing resources of the Natal coal fields. However, I feel that, before we interfere with the northern area of the Kruger National Park, we should ask whether all the possibilities for solving Iscor&#x2019;s dilemma have been explored. For example, are there not other sources which we could exploit? I am told, for example, that there might be exploitable deposits in Venda. I am told that they would be difficult to mine because the deposits are badly faulted, but in South Africa the gold mining industry overcame technical problems that nobody else in the world could. Do we have other deposits we are unaware of?</p>

<p>Secondly, are there possibly other methods of producing steel which require less use of coking coal or perhaps do not require the use of coking coal at all? At present Iscor is committed to the conventional blast-furnace methods of steel production, which have changed very little in the last 50 years. They have been improved, but basically they have not changed. We know that there are other methods, such as the direct reduction method which is used, for example, by Highveld Steel and Vanadium. These methods allow the use of non-coking coal in the production of steel. There is, of course, also the formed-coke process, which involves either the making of coke briquets by carbonizing coal or carbonizing coal into a fine <span class="col_921-922" refersTo="page_0488"/>char and making it into a form which can be used in blast furnaces.</p>

<p>I think it would be true to say that in the area of iron and steel technology we have tended to follow overseas developments. I ask whether the time has not come for Iscor to do for iron and steel technology what Sasol has done for oil-from-coal technology &#x2014;people said it was impossible to obtain oil from coal. Inevitably we shall have to find alternative methods for making iron and steel because ultimately we shall run out of suitable coking coal. Should we not embark upon this programme of research now?</p>

<p>I believe that before we decide to interfere with the Kruger National Park, we need to explore every alternative. This is not a time for hasty action. Let us not rush in like fools where angels fear to tread. Regrettably, history is full of examples where man has tampered with the environment with disastrous results. We know what has happened to the fishing industry in this regard. When it comes to understanding the operations of nature, we are babes in the wood. I know that there is a committee of inquiry investigating the question of mining in the Kruger National Park. Indeed, I think it may have reported already to the hon. the Minister. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us that it is not necessary to undertake mining operations in the Kruger National Park. However, if he cannot tell us that, I hope he will give us the assurance that before any steps are taken to undertake mining operations in the Kruger National Park, the matter will be fully investigated and reported on by a commission of inquiry consisting of experts from various disciplines, including ecological experts.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS, FORESTRY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank the hon. member for Edenvale for dealing with the question of the mining of coking coal in the Kruger National Park in such a responsible manner. He was indeed very responsible in his approach and I am very, very thankful for it. This is a matter which can be approached in a very emotional way. I am convinced that, if one were not to keep a cool head in regard to this matter, it could land us in trouble and it could be detrimental to the whole question of environmental conservation in South Africa. It could harm South Africa internationally in a very big way.</p>

<p>Om daardie rede het ek dadelik tot die debat toegetree. Ek het wel die verslag ontvang van die komitee wat aangestel is om ondersoek in te stel na die kookssteenkool in die noordelike gedeelte van die Krugerwild-tuin. Nadat die verslag bestudeer is, het dit duidelik geword dat daar nog &#x2019;n hele aantal vrae is wat onbeantwoord gebly het. Die departement en ek gaan van die standpunt uit&#x2014;presies soos die agb. lid dit daar gestel het&#x2014;dat voordat daar toegelaat word dat kookssteenkool in die Krugerwildtuin ontgin word, daar 100&#x0025; sekerheid moet wees dat daar hoegenaamd geen ander alternatief is nie. Dit is presies wat ons probeer doen. Sonder dat ek geweet het dat ons op hierdie datum die Begrotingspos sou bespreek, het ek hierdie aangeleentheid toevallig op Donderdag met die Habitatraad bespreek en op Vrydag met die Nasionale Parkeraad. Ek het ook vir hulle hierdie situasie uitgewys en ek dink dit is nodig dat daar verdere onder-soeke ingestel word. Tot tyd en wyl daardie ondersoeke gedoen is, is ek nie van plan om die huidige verslag vry te stel nie omdat dit nie volledige antwoorde gee nie. Ek wil onderstreep dat dit nie is omdat daardie komitee nie &#x2019;n behoorlike ondersoek gedoen het nie. Ek dink die lede was uitstaande persone en ek dink dat hulle binne die raamwerk van die opdrag wat aan hulle gegee is, &#x2019;n uitstaande verslag uitgebring het. Juis omdat hulle &#x2019;n goeie verslag uitgebring het, het dit duidelik geword dat daar sekere leemtes is wat verder ondersoek moet word. Ek wil agb. lede die versekering gee dat alle pogings aangewend sal word om te kyk of dit voorkom kan word dat die kookssteenkool in die Wildtuin ontgin word.</p>

<p>Ek kan s&#x00EA;, Meneer, dat daar groot bedrae geld hierby betrokke is. Die agb. lid het gewys op ander metodes wat vir die vervaardiging van staal gebruik word.</p>

<p>One of those is the direct reduction process. One must realize, however, that at present Iscor is using the blast-furnace system. To supplant the blast-furnace system with a direct reduction system might cost many thousands of rand.</p>

<p>You mean many millions.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I mean many millions of rand. I do not want to name a figure. I do not think it is possible to name a figure. Let it suffice that it will cost many millions of rand. One must therefore approach this whole affair in a very responsible manner. I hope that the hon. member will accept what I have told him now.</p>

<p>Ek weet hoe die mense van Suid-Afrika oor die Krugerwildtuin voel. Ek onthou die dae toe die Parkeraad besluit het om President Kruger se kop op &#x2019;n klip uit te kap en die ontsteltenis wat dit toe veroorsaak het&#x2014; dit was nie oor die President se kop nie, maar oor die klip! Ek s&#x00EA; weer, is ek bly dat die agb. lid die saak so hanteer het en ek dank hom daarvoor.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. member for Bryanston is concerned, he will realize that the education of the public is, as has always been said, one way of improving environmental conservation. In this respect, as he sees it, the fast change in Ministers means that, at least, there are educated men in the Cabinet now.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het &#x2019;n lang betoog gehad oor hoe ons die omgewing verwaarloos. Ek glo darem nie die agb. lid het heeltemal reg nie. Veral wanneer dit kom by bodembeskerming, lugbesoedeling, geraasbesoedeling en baie ander soorte besoedeling, dink ek dat as &#x2019;n mens alles opblaas, jy mense sal kry wat met jou saamstem en ander wat nie met jou saamstem nie. Laat ons nie daaroor baklei nie. Kom ons erken vir mekaar dat dit &#x2019;n uiters belangrike afdeling van ons volkshuishouding is hierdie waarna ons moet omsien. Ek dink die Regering het in die Witskrif wat verlede jaar ter tafel gel&#x00EA; is, sy standpunt ten opsigte van omgewingsbewaring vir die toekoms baie duidelik uitgespel. By daardie geleentheid het die Regering ook wetgewing gepubliseer wat daarop gebaseer was en wat ondersoek is deur &#x2019;n Gekose Komitee wat later in &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek omskep is waarvan ons die verslag kort voor lank hoop te kry. Ek hoop dit is ons ems. Wat ons ook al van die hele situasie dink, is dit, waar ons met omgewingsbewaring te doen het, na my mening nodig dat ons die slagkreet wat ek onlangs gelees het, onsself moet voorhou, te wete &#x201E;today is the yesterday of tomorrow&#x201D;. Wat vernietig is, kan nie weer herstel word nie. As ons almal saam-werk en saambou aan dit wat nodig is, as ons mekaar waar nodig op die vingers tik maar ook saam skouer teen die wiel gooi wanneer dit nodig is, dink ek dat ons op hierdie gebied iets in Suid-Afrika kan bereik. Hierdie hele aangeleentheid is vir ons besonder belangrik.</p>

<p>Om vir agb. lede &#x2019;n aanduiding te gee van h&#x00F3;&#x00E9; belangrik ons dit beskou&#x2014;en ook omdat dit soveel geriefliker is&#x2014;wil ek s&#x00EA; dat die huidige naam van die departement, te wete die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring, verander gaan word. Die huidige naam is so &#x2019;n lang naam waarmee &#x2019;n mens opgesaal is. Dit is amper soos &#x2019;n albatros om jou nek. Dan is dit vir my &#x2019;n voorreg om aan te kondig dat die Staatspresident goedgunstig toegestem het dat die departement se naam verander word na die Departement van Omgewingsake, of in Engels die Department of Environment Affairs. Die twee vakkundige direktorate wat die grootste gedeelte van die departement uitmaak, sal nog steeds hul geregver-digde erkenning geniet en sal bekend staan as die Direktoraat van Waterwese (Water Affairs) en die Direktoraat van Boswese (Forestry). Die departement sal dus twee briefhoofde gebruik. Een sal wees &#x201E;Die Departement van Omgewingsake&#x2014;Direktoraat Waterwese&#x201D; en die ander sal wees &#x201E;Die Departement van Omgewingsake &#x2014;Direktoraat Boswese&#x201D;. Ek het spesiaal onmiddellik na die agb. lid vir Edenvale opgestaan omdat daardie aankondiging en &#x2019;n aangeleentheid soos die Krugerwildtuin na my mening nie iets is waaroor &#x2019;n polemiek aan die gang gesit moet word nie.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Kimberley-Noord het gepraat oor die kwessie van sprinkelbe-sproeiing. Ek het vroe&#x00EB;r in die debat reeds die belangrikheid daarvan beklemtoon dat ons in die toekoms en ook tans sover moont-lik water moet bespaar. Soos ek ook reeds voorheen ges&#x00EA; het, het die departement vasgestel dat by &#x2019;n sekere skema wat vir 60&#x0025; doeltreffend is, daar &#x2019;n tekort van 29 miljoen kubieke meter water is en by dieselfde skema indien boere 80&#x0025; doeltreffend is, die tekort 3,4 miljoen kubieke meter is. Dit is fenomenale syfers.</p>

<p><span class="col_925-926" refersTo="page_0490"/>Die agb. lid het ook &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB;r subsidie bepleit. Die subsidie word van tyd tot tyd aangepas. Dit kan alleen met die toestemming van die Tesourie aangepas word. Die agb. lid het die probleemgeskets van die pa met die vier plase en die pa met die drie seuns. Die pa wat vier plase maar geen seuns het nie, lyk vir my na &#x2019;n redelike ryk man. Hy sal dus maar moet betaal. Wat die pa met die drie seuns betref, hou ons in ons optrede in gedagte dat die Bybel s&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Hoe lieflik is dit as broers saamwoon&#x201D;. Ek wil onderneem dat ons met die oog op die beter benutting van water die hele situasie van die subsidie op sprinkelbesproeiingstelsels en ander be-sproeiingsstelsels voortdurend onder o&#x00EB; sal hou. As &#x2019;n mens geld moet bestee, dink ek dat dit goed sal wees om dit te bestee met die oog op die beter benutting van water.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Sondagsrivier het die voor-siening van meer water vir Kirkwood se w&#x00EA;reld bepleit. Wat die agb. lid oor die be-sondere potensiaal van daardie gebied ges&#x00EA; het, is korrek. My departement en ook die Departement van Landbou en Visserye is daarvan bewus. In hierdie geval is dit geheel en al &#x2019;n kwessie van die beskikbaarheid van fondse en van prioriteite wat bepaal moet word. Daar is niks anders wat op die spel is nie. Daar is verkeerdelik die indruk gelaat&#x2014; ek glo nie my voorganger het dit so bedoel nie&#x2014;dat daar niks verder aan die uitbreiding van die voorsiening van water uit die Oranjerivier gedoen word nie. Dit is nie die geval nie. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, is dit slegs &#x2019;n kwessie van prioriteite en sal ons in die toekoms wel daarop terugkom. Dit is egter nie vir my moontlik om in hierdie stadium te s&#x00EA; wanneer daardie aangename tyd sal aanbreek nie. Ons is tevrede dat, as gevolg van die pompskema vanaf Wellington Grove in die Skoenmakersrivier af tot by Mentzmeer, daar nou voldoende water vir die huidige besproeiingsbehoeftes voorsien word. Dit het ook ten gevolg dat die kwaliteit van die water dermate verbeter het dat ook d&#x00ED;t vir die huidige besproeiingsvereistes aanneemlik is. Vorentoe sal daar met die skema voortgegaan word. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, is dit net &#x2019;n kwessie van die beskikbaarheid van fondse. Hoeveel prioriteit daar aan hierdie skema verleen kan word, sal onder meer ook afhang van die mate waarin die Port Eliza-beth-gebied water nodig sal h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n klein sakie waarna ek voorheen nagelaat het om te verwys. Die agb. lid vir De Aar het my gevra of ons nog voortgaanmet die duikpype vanaf die Ramah-kanaal onder die Oranjerivier deur na die linker oewer van die rivier om die Petrusville-gebied en die Fluitjieskraal-Oraniagebied te besproei. Ek kan vir hom s&#x00EA; dat die beplan ning nog so is en dat ons sekerlik binnekort &#x2019;n verdere aankondiging daaroor sal doen.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">L. M. THEUNISSEN</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. Minister het nou so pas aangekondig dat toestemming verleen is vir die verandering van die naam van die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring&#x2014;daardie lang naam wat hy gehad het. Ek dink dit is met &#x2019;n tik-kie hartseer en weemoed dat ons as boere afskeid neem van hierdie welbekende naam, &#x201E;Departement van Waterwese&#x201D;. In my bydrae vandag sal ek egter nog steeds verwys na die Departement van Waterwese, aangesien die ander naam waarskynlik eers in die nabye toekoms in werking sal tree. Uit die nuwe naam kan &#x2019;n mens die afleiding maak dat daar darem nou aan ons omgewing se sake aandag gegee sal word.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag my bydrae in hierdie debat koppel aan en toelig met die maak van &#x2019;n paar stellings wat eint-lik niks nuuts inhou nie, maar wat algemeen goed bekend is. Ek wil dit doen omdat ek my gedagtes wil bepaal by wat ek noem die Departement van Waterwese se verantwoor-delikheid om te help met die skep van infra-strukture, of, waar dit reeds bestaan, die Departement van Waterwese se verantwoor-delikheid om te help met die instandhouding van daardie infrastrukture. Wanneer ek verwys na infrastrukture, dan bedoel ek infrastrukture in &#x2019;n bepaalde gebied, &#x2019;n gebied wat vandag bekend is as die &#x201E;aangewese gebied&#x201D;. Dit is gebiede wat aangewys is ingevolge die Wet op die Bevordering van Bevolkingsdigtheid, No. 87 van 1979. Dit is die gebiede wat gelee is aan die noordelike en suidoostelike grense van Transvaal.</p>

<p>Die stellinge wat ek wil maak, is die volgende: Eerstens wil ek s&#x00EA; dat waar daar water is, daar lewe is. Die tweede stelling is dat waar daar water en elektriese krag is, daar lewe, ontwikkeling en vooruitgang is. Die derde stelling is dat waar daar lewe en ontwikkeling is, daar infrastrukture tot stand kom. Die vierde stelling is dat waar daar infrastrukture <span class="col_927-928" refersTo="page_0491"/>tot stand kom, daar word bevolkingsdigtheid bevorder. Soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, Meneer, wil ek graag praat oor die Departement van Waterwese se verantwoor-delikheid om te help om die bevolkingsdigtheid in grensgebiede te bevorder.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, as dit nie reeds twee jaar gelede die absolute ems van die Regering was om daardie gebiede uit te sonder vir spesiale behandeling nie, dan het die bestaan van die betrekke wetgewing vir my geen sin en betekenis nie. Die noodsaaklikheid daarvan en die redes waarom, op Kabinetsvlak, dit goedgevind was om dringend en ernstig aandag te gee aan die bevordering van bevollungsdigtheid in daardie gebiede, hoef nie aan die einde van 1981 hier betwyfel te word nie. As dit in 1979 alreeds dringend geag was dat soveel moontlik mense in daardie grensgebiede gevestig word, dan het dit vandag nog dringender geword. En niemand kan tog met hierdie standpunt van my verskil nie.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Goed gevestigde boeregemeenskap in die grensgebiede is die sekerste waarborg waarop ook op milit&#x00EA;re gebied ons kan ver-seker dat terroristiese elemente nie ons land uit die noordelike buurstate insypel of insluip nie. Rhodesi&#x00EB; het vir ons duidelik bewys dat die stryd daar nie deur die grens-boere verloor was nie, maar in die konferen-siesale verloor was. Dit, Meneer, is die punt wat ek graag wil tuisbring. As ons nie ons prioriteite in hersiening neem, veral in die lig van die toenemende intensifisering van die aanslag teen ons land nie, dan gaan ons grensgebiede die eerste plek word waar ons vyande &#x2019;n vastrapplek gaan kry.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook &#x2019;n verdere stelling maak wat betref prioriteite oor watergebruik en water-voorsiening. &#x2019;n Mens kry dikwels die indruk dat dit in &#x2019;n groot mate net die plattelander is wat waardering het vir hierdie grootste van al Suid-Afrika se bates, naamlik sy water &#x2014;alhoewel die agb. Minister vanmiddag ook daarop gewys het dat ons boeregemeenskap baie skuldig is daaraan dat die water wat tot hulle beskikking is nie genoeg-saam en doeltreffend gebruik word nie. Maar, mnr. die Voorsitter, by verre die grootste aanspraakmakers op water is vandag die stadsmense, die industrie&#x00EB;, die nywerhede en die fabrieke. Dit is ook so dat die miljoene stadsmense, met al hul fantastiese infrastrukture, dikwels diegene is by wie daar die minste waardering is vir hulle infrastrukture, hul pragtige skole, &#x2019;n poskantoor om die draai, die elektriese krag, teer-paaie, en natuurlik ook water. Dit is dikwels die mense wat daarmee mors en dit bevuil en vergiftig. Dit is water wat deur die platteland terugvloei see toe, en dit kan groot skade aan die boer veroorsaak. Ek noem hierdie dinge omdat daar deurlopend &#x2019;n debat onder ons boere aan die gang is oor die prioriteite van die Departement van Waterwese. Dit is so dat die man van die platteland met steeds groter wordende bekommernis bewus word van die steeds groter en groter aansprake wat stede, nywerhede en industrie&#x00EB; op die waters van Suid-Afrika maak. As ek dit nie verkeerd het nie, Meneer, is dit die Staat wat die prioriteite bepaal, of kan bepaal. En dit is reg so; daarvoor het &#x2019;n mens begrip. Dit is egter die Departement van Waterwese se verantwoor-delikheid om daarvoor te sorg dat daar &#x2019;n gesonde ewewig gehandhaaf word tussen die belange van alle groepe in die voorsiening van &#x2019;n wye reeks skemas en fasiliteite vir die gebruik en verbruik van water.</p>

<p>Dit bring my terug by die stelling dat daar &#x2019;n groot verantwoordelikheid en plig op die Departement van Waterwese rus om te help met die totstandbrenging van infrastrukture oral in Suid-Afrika, maar veral ook in die grensgebiede, die sogenaamde aangewese gebiede. Meneer, ek maak dit my plig om in elke debat waaraan ek deelneem te vra en te pleit vir die daarstelling en instandhouding van infrastrukture in daardie gebiede. Ek doen dit omdat dit ook in nasionale belang is dat daar besef word dat in daardie strategiese gebiede dit die plig is van elke Staats-departement en ook die plig is van die provinsiale owerhede, om by te dra aan die dringende hulp wat in daardie gebiede verleen moet word. Een departement kan nie alleen hierdie groot taak, naamlik die skep-ping en die instandhouding van infrastrukture, verrig nie. Dit is ook die taak van al die ander departemente, en daarom wil ek vanmiddag pleit dat daar stappe gedoen moet word om &#x2019;n oorhoofse, ko&#x00F6;rdinerende interdepartementele komitee in die lewe te roep wat sal sorg dat in daardie gebiede daar behoorlike ko&#x00F6;rdinasie is tussen die verskillende departemente wanneer dit kom by die skepping van infrastrukture. Meneer, dit is <span class="col_929-930" refersTo="page_0492"/>prioriteite wat vir ons in daardie gebiede van belang is.</p>

<p>Een van daardie prioriteite wil ek graag nou noem, naamlik die bevordering van besproeiingsboerdery in die Benede-Krokodilrivier-besproeiingsgebied, asook in die besproeiingsgebied aan die Maricogebied in die omgewing van Derdepoort. Adjunk-minister Sarel Hayward het onlangs ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;In daardie ekstensiewe gebiede is dit baie moeilik om &#x2019;n verdigting van die bevolking te bewerkstellig, tensy &#x2019;n mens besproeiingsboerdery kan aanmoedig.&#x201D; [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. J. S. OLIVIER</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek is dankbaar om te kan volg op die agb. lid, mnr. Theunissen, omdat dit wat ek te s&#x00EA; het baie strook met wat die agb. lid so pas ges&#x00EA; het, veral ten opsigte van die instandhouding van bestaande infrastrukture. Dan, Meneer, praat ek graag in hierdie debat as lid vir Fauresmith, siende dat die agb. Minister die vorige lid vir Fauresmith was. Ek glo dus dat die agb. Minister miskien meer as wat normaalweg die geval sou gewees het, begrip vir my problemsal h&#x00EA;. Ek weet &#x2019;n mens moet versigtig wees voordat jy &#x2019;n Van der Merwe prys, maar ek wil by voorbaat al hierdie Van der Merwes prys, want ek dink die agb. Minister gaan my probleemoplos.</p>

<p>Ek glo dat die agb. Minister die beleid van die Departement van Waterwese, soos aan-vanklik gestel, onder andere in die Witskrif oor die Oranjerivier-projek, gestand sal doen, naamlik dat bestaande besproeiing-skemas se beveiliging ho&#x00EB; prioriteit sal geniet wanneer nuwe kapitaalwerke binne die Departement van Waterwese aangegaan word. Dit is miskien goed om spesifiek na hierdie verslag oor die Oranjerivier-projek te verwys en hierdie enkele doelstelling voor te lees&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die doelstelling van die Oranjerivier-ontwikkelingsprojek bly in sy geheel nog steeds soos in W.P. X&#x2014;&#x2019;62 gestel.</block>

<p>Daardie doelstelling word dan omskryf as die instandhouding of beveiliging van die bestaande besproeiing in die Rietrivier-besproeiingskema in sy geheel.</p>

<p>Dan, mnr. die Voorsitter, kom ons by die onderwerp wat onder andere die agb. lid, mnr. Theunissen, hier aangeroer het, naamlik die instandhouding van bestaande infrastrukture. Die agb. Minister sal die infrastruktuur rondom die Rietrivierbesproei-ingskema dalk nog beter ken as ek self, maar laat ons dit dan maar vir mekaar opnuut weer uitspel. Wat is dit? Dit is in die eerste instansie &#x2019;n besproeiingskema wat deur twee groot teerpaaie deurkruis word, &#x2019;n besproeiingskema met twee groot spoorver-bindings en, onder andere, &#x2019;n inmaakfa-briek, &#x2019;n pluismeul en, al glo Kaaplanders dit miskien nie, ook &#x2019;n wynkelder. Dit is &#x2019;n besproeiingskema met &#x2019;n infrastruktuur wat bestaan uit betonkanale waarvan die hoof-kanaal langer as 100 km is, en dan is daar nog &#x2019;n massa van kleinere vertakkings. Meneer, dit is &#x2019;n infrastruktuur wat onder andere &#x2019;n diamantmyn insluit, waaruit die Staat jaarliks etlike miljoene rande maak. Dit is &#x2019;n infrastruktuur wat rofweg 3 600 Blanke persone en soveel as ongeveer 31 000 Nieblanke persone bedien, &#x2019;n infrastruktuur waarvan hulle afhanklik is. As hierdie infrastruktuur ter sprake kom, dan dink ek is dit die moeite werd dat indien die Departement van Waterwese aan kapitaalwerke dink, of indien hulle dink aan die beveiliging van enige besproeiingskema, hierdie besproeiingskema ho&#x00EB; voorkeur sal geniet. Wat is die meeste wat ons in hierdie stadium aan die agb. Minister kan vra? Ons vra nie dat daar onmiddellik in hierdie verband voor-siening gemaak sal word deur byvoorbeeld die bou van &#x2019;n kanaal vanaf die Oranjerivier nie, want ons weet dat die agb. Minister soms in &#x2019;n sekere rigting geforseer word ten opsigte van die keuse van prioriteite. Die agb. Minister het trouens genoem dat as daar Sasols gebou word, dit nie &#x2019;n werklike keuse is of die Rietrivier-besproeiingskema eers van water voorsien kan word, en of daar onmiddellik water aan die nuwe Sasol voorsien moet word nie. Ons aanvaar dit, maar ek wil dit tog aan die agb. Minister stel dat prioriteite ook oornag kan verander of wissel. Ek wil in hierdie verband &#x2019;n baie spesifieke voorbeeld uit daardie omgewing aanhaal. Kan die agb. Minister onthou dat destyds, na die Sharpeville-onluste, een van ons vorige Eerste Ministers die Oranjerivier-ontwikkelingsprojek aangekondig het? Dit, Meneer, was nie bloot om besproeiing in hierdie land te bevorder nie; dit was ook, om ander redes, &#x2019;n prioriteit wat oornag <span class="col_931-932" refersTo="page_0493"/>verander het. En terwyl ek daar is, mnr. die Voorsitter, hoe het daardie projek homself nie bewys nie? Ek het hier in my hand &#x2019;n opsomming van wat gemaak word uit die verkoop van elektrisiteit van die H. F. Ver-woerd-en P. K. le Roux-dam. Waar die H. F. Verwoerd-dam destyds R98 800 000 gekos het, is die opbrengs net uit die verkoop van elektrisiteit R15 290 000. Eintlik is dit &#x2019;n pragtige rente-opbrengs. Ek wens dat my boerdery so sou betaal! Die P. K. le Roux-dam het destyds R93 miljoen gekos om te bou. Die opbrengs daaruit, net uit elektrisi-teitsverkope, en gereken teen die gemiddelde kilowat-uur-prys van elektrisiteit, beloop R14 386 000. So, Meneer, het &#x2019;n prioriteit verander, en is &#x2019;n nuwe skema skielik aange-pak. Dikwels kom die vraag dan by &#x2019;n mens op: Was die voorafbeplanning ten opsigte van hierdie skema gereed sodat, toe die tyd aanbreek dat dit aangepak moes word, die skema werklik in sy bre&#x00EB; konteks gesien was en behoorlik ontwikkel kon word? So kan die prioriteit ten opsigte van die voorsiening van besproeiingswater byvoorbeeld ook verander, as gevolg van &#x2019;n tekort aan arbeidsgeleenthede, want besproeiingsgrond is, soos u weet, arbeidsintensief. Dit vereis dan weer eens voorafbeplanning&#x2014;en hier dink ek weer aan die Rietrivierbe-sproeiingskema&#x2014;sodat, as die geleentheid en die fondse daar is, daarmee voortgegaan sal kan word en die nodige sekerheid, wat nou ontbreek, ook by die besproeiingsboere in daardie gebied herstel kan word omdat ons dan sal weet dat in die toekoms hierdie skema wel die nodige aandag sal geniet. As &#x2019;n mens daaraan dink dat dit ons erns is om die nasionale State te konsolideer, en om hervestigingsmoontlikhede vir boere te skep, dan wonder jy waar ons &#x2019;n beter oplossing sou kon bedink as die voorsiening van bykomende besproeiingsgrond. Dit bring ook die kwessie van kosvoorsiening ter sprake. So dikwels hou ons juis kosvoorsiening voor as een van die effektiefste wapens in die hande van Suid-Afrika. Dit alles, Meneer, hang saam met die ontwikkeling van besproeiingsgrond.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek glo dat die agb. Minister alreeds die nodige aandag aan hierdie probleemvan my gegee het. Ek wil dan ook my dank aan die agb. Minister en sy departement oordra vir die grondige ondersoek wat tot op hede gedoen is ten opsigte van hierdie spesifieke probleme. Ons wil vertrou en glo dat die agb. Minister die uitspraak wat hy &#x2019;n tyd gelede gemaak het, gestand sal doen. Toe hy met van ons Vrystaters gepraat het, het hy ges&#x00EA; ons moet altyd onthou, bloed is dikker as water. Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. Minister moet onthou: Bloed moet dikker bly as water. In hierdie geval dink ek werklik dit sal geregverdig wees.</p>

<speech by="#hulley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">R. R. HULLEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, as the first speaker on this side since the hon. the Minister made his announcement about changing the department&#x2019;s name, I would like to welcome that announcement. I think this is a very positive first step in the right direction, although I think it is only the first of many steps that need to be taken in connection with managing the environment properly.</p>

<p>The task of conserving and managing the environment is an urgent and a challenging one, but up to now I think it is fair to say that the official response from the authorities has been characterized by hopelessly inadequate foot-dragging. I should just like to name some examples. We have environmental legislation in the pipeline which was, during the last environment debate last year, promised for later in that year. It still has not seen the light of day, and probably will not, until 1982. To take a small example, but a very important one in the Western Cape, the report on Table Mountain and the Peninsula Mountain Chain was tabled on 7 April 1978, but to this day not one recommendation has been implemented. It is subject to a further inquiry and recommendations, which have yet to come. Then, Sir, there is the example mentioned by the hon. member for Edenvale: Only 7&#x00BD;&#x0025; of South Africa is conserved, whereas the international minimum standard is 10&#x0025;. Possibly the most important is that we still have a shotgun approach to environmental management in South Africa. We have a number of independent organizations responsible for different aspects of environmental management, all working for similar aims, and laudably so, but working in parallel, without coordination. We have provinces, divisional councils, parks boards, municipalities, various Government departments and private organizations and statutory bodies, all <span class="col_933-934" refersTo="page_0494"/>in a sense milling about in the environment field. I wish to call today for a two-tier principle for the management of the environment.</p>

<p>The first principle is that there should be centralized co-ordination&#x2014;and in this connection I welcome the announcement of one name for this department. The second principle is that there should be decentralized management. The two principles are therefore centralized co-ordination and decentralized regional management of environmental affairs. As far as the first principle, central co-ordination, is concerned, this should fall under one Department of Environmental Affairs, responsible for overall co-ordination of all environmental matters, such as forests, mountains, the sea-shore, estuaries, water resources, parks, resorts, reserves, natural areas as envisaged by the Act, environmental education, catchment areas, flora and fauna, pollution, and one could perhaps even include what the hon. member for Bryanston has referred to, namely soil conservation. There are many things that should be drawn in under this one umbrella. It is high time all the stray threads of environmental management were drawn together, and this can only be done under the umbrella of one single, powerful department.</p>

<p>The second element, Mr. Chairman, is no less important. In fact, I would say it is more important. I refer to the principle of decentralized regional management on a day-to-day basis. I would envisage regional management boards for this purpose&#x2014; streeksomgewingsrade&#x2014;statutory bodies consisting of localized public leadership, which would undertake the executive management of the environment in each region. It cannot be a regional department of officials; it must involve local public leaders and experts. My appeal is for the creation of strong regional bodies, with teeth, which are representative of the local communities in which they operate, so that local pride and the local involvement of the people can be harnessed, and so that we do not have a resentment of a big bureaucracy based only in Pretoria. I believe that the principle of decentralized management is vital to the success of management in the environmental field, because you have to involve the public in the management of the environment, or our efforts will fail. The closest existing model for what I am proposing, in respect of the decentralized management principle, is the present Natal Parks Board. This is a statutory body with most of the broad management powers which I believe it needs, which has a strong local flavour, and which operates under the umbrella of the Natal Provincial Administration. I believe this Parks Board is an excellent example of a strong, successful regional environmental authority, and we would do well&#x2014;and this is what I am pleading for&#x2014;to establish similar bodies in other regions of South Africa. For the purposes of the Western Cape, by way of example&#x2014;because it is closest to me&#x2014;I would like to see a Western Cape Environment Board. I think the word &#x201C;parks&#x201D; is too limited. This board should also fall under the one Department of Environmental Affairs.</p>

<p>This debate covers a vast field, and I wish we could have more time for it, but in the brief time available to me I would like to list some of the important tasks which I envisage for a Western Cape Environment Board. Firstly, it should take over the present regional functions of Forestry and Water Affairs. This is already envisaged, as the hon. the Minister has indicated. Secondly, it should take over control of the sea-shore and the estuaries from other Government departments. Thirdly, it should control the management of particular natural areas, such as Table Mountain, Langebaan, etc., in consultation with advisory committees formed from local leadership people, for those particular natural areas. Fourthly, it should manage and extend the existing and proposed reserves in the Western Cape. There are many that should be in the pipeline, and are too slow in coming into being. Fifthly, it should develop parks and reserves and overnight facilities in areas of natural beauty in the region. Here I am thinking of facilities like hutted camps, botanical gardens in other areas, etc. Sixthly, it should supervise environment education programmes and stimulate environment research. Seventhly, it should manage and preserve the fynbos ecosystem more effectively than it is being done at the moment. Finally, it should prepare environmental impact studies in respect of all major developments in this region.</p>

<p>I have only listed eight major items for <span class="col_935-936" refersTo="page_0495"/>this region; I am sure each region would have its own priorities as well. This proposal for a new dispensation will, I hope, be taken into account by the commission that is sitting on this subject at the moment. It does imply a much bigger budget for environmental purposes, but to my mind this is a very small price to pay for the proper care of our natural world. The environment is our precious legacy from the past, and it is our duty to conserve it properly for our children and our children&#x2019;s children.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. H. LOUW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, there is such a vast difference between Constantia and the place where I come from, that the hon. member must pardon me for not making any remarks on the speech he has just made. I come from a place where water is something we use to drink. We also get used to taking our brandy neat at certain times of the year. When things go a bit far and we find that the drinks are too short, we add a little beer to make the drink a little bit longer!</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag aansluit by vorige sprekers wat waardering uitge-spreek het vir die wonderlike diens wat die agb. Minister aan ons lewer. Ek kan u ver-seker&#x2014;en ek s&#x00EA; dit namens my kiesafdeling &#x2014;dat ons baie dankbaar is om &#x2019;n man in hierdie Pos te h&#x00EA; wat die taal van &#x2019;n boer verstaan. Dit is &#x2019;n baie eenvoudige taal.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanaand praat oor die feit dat daar in die Verwoerd-dam genoeg water is vir die besproeiing van nog &#x2019;n verdere 100 000 ha grond. Die bou van die Verwoerd-dam kan met reg gesien word as een van die hoogte-punte in ons land se geskiedenis van water-bewaring. Dit is absoluut &#x2019;n wonderlike ondervinding om tot sover as 300 tot 400 km suid van die dam te kan sien hoedat die water van die Oranjerivier dele van die dorre Karoo in &#x2019;n paradys omskep. Nou is dit egter ook so dat hierdie water vanaf die tonneluitlaat by Teebus deur dro&#x00EB; distrikte loop wat geen voordeel daarvan kry nie. In dieselfde prentjie wil ek sien baie ander distrikte in die Karoostreek wat gereeld gebuk gaan onder rampdroogtes, en waar die Staat astronomiese somme geld spandeer aan droogtehulp. In sulke tye word voer ten duurste oor lang afstande vervoer om dit by die verbruikerspunt te kry. Ek herinner my ook aan talie debatte wat op verskillende vlakke gevoer is, en wat baie ure in beslag geneem het, ten einde te besin oor voer-banke vir droogtetye. Die uitvoerbaarheid van talie voorgestelde skemas het almal op &#x2019;n nul uitgeloop. Die goeie wil van ons ko-operatiewe beweging is gekanselleer deur die geweldige bergingskoste wat die droogtege-teisterde boer eenvoudig nie kan bekostig nie. Ons het &#x2019;n sentrale ko&#x00F6;perasie gestig, by name Voer-Sentrale Ko&#x00F6;peratief, en behalwe die genoemde probleemvan opberging, sit hulle ook met die probleemvan distribusie en die agteruitgang van die gehalte van opgebergte voer. Baie meer as die helfte van die gebied wat tans deur die Verwoerd-dam se water besproei word in Oos-Kaapland is geteister met swaar ryp en &#x2019;n baie kort groeiseisoen. Gevolglik is die boere wat water kry, hoofsaaklik aangewys op lusernproduksie. Gedurende droogtetye geniet hierdie mense &#x2019;n groot aanvraag vir hulle produk, maar die mark is baie wisselvallig, want sodra dit weer gereent het, is daar weer &#x2019;n ooraanbod van lusern. Die gevolg is dat talie van hierdie besproeiings-boere hulle wend tot ander metodes van boerdery, soos vetlamproduksie en selfs ko-ring-of mielieverbouing. Die punt wat ek probeer bewys, Meneer, is dat die droogte-geteisterde Karooboer nie kan staatmaak op &#x2019;n bestendige bron van voer nie, en verder dat hy dikwels, soos in die praktyk bewys is, tot die uiterste toe uitgebuit word wanneer hy in sy nood verstommende pryse gevra word vir selfs minderwaardige voer.</p>

<p>Die anderkant van die prentjie wat ek probeer skets is dat groot dele van ons land afgestaan is vir die skepping van tuislande vir ons Swart mense. Omdat sommige van hierdie Swart volkere min of geen landbouaanleg toon nie is dit absoluut gebiedend noodsaaklik dat elke duim grond wat nog in Blanke besit is tot die optimum produktief gemaak moet word. Dit moet ons sien teen die agtergrond van die projeksie dat daar teen die einde van die eeu 50 miljoen mense gevoed sal moet word. In effek beteken dit dat die Suid-Afrikaanse boer hom gereed moet hou om elke dag 10 500 maaltye meer te lewer as wat hy die vorige dag gelewer het. In Engels praat ons van &#x2019;n &#x201E;tall order&#x201D;. Hierdie is voorwaar &#x2019;n baie &#x201E;tall order&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Die konvensionele manier waarop water uit die meeste van ons besproeiingsdamme <span class="col_937-938" refersTo="page_0496"/>aangewend word, is om &#x2019;n besproeiingsge-bied uit te soek, dit in persele op te meet en dan tenders te vra vir okkupeerders. Hierdie aansoekers word dan so goed as moontlik gekeur en onder sekere voorwaardes in besit gestel van die persele. In die Visriviervallei het ek gesien dat sommige van hulle &#x2019;n groot sukses maak, maar daar was ook diegene wat eenvoudig verdwyn het omdat hulle nie die regte jokkies was nie.</p>

<p>My versoek is dan ook vanaand aan die agb. Minister of daar nie ten opsigte van die 100 000 ha wat ek genoem het, afgewyk kan word van die konvensionele metode van besproeiing ten einde bestaande plase in die Karoo meer weerbaar teen droogtes te maak nie. Ek weet die ingenieurs sal hul hande in die lug gooi oor lang en duur kanale en dat die hidrolo&#x00EB; oor verdamping sal huil, maar hierdie is slim mense en ek glo dat as hulle wil, kan hulle &#x2019;n plan bedink om vir die bestaande, uitgetoetste boere op hulle plase water te bring vir &#x2019;n beperkte getal besproeibare hektaar. As ons dit so min soos 10 ha per boer maak, kan ons 10 000 boere met hierdie water teen droogtes weerbaar maak. Ek glo in die gebied wat ek in gedagte het, elke plaas darem 10 ha grond sal h&#x00EA; wat aan die standaarde vir besproeiing sal voldoen. Ek dink nie ons moet so baie hare oor fyn tegniese puntjies kloof nie. Ons moet &#x2019;n praktiese ding doen om &#x2019;n wesenlike probleemvir ons boere in die Karoo op te los.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_wyk">

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag verwys na &#x2019;n gebied binne die distrik Gordonia wat bekend staan as die Kalahari, &#x2019;n gebied waar daar met relatief baie min water &#x2019;n groot landboupotensiaal vir ons land ontplooi kan word. Die weidings-potensiaal van hierdie gebied word totaal onderskat. Die feit dat dit vandag &#x2019;n buffer-strook tussen die Republiek en Suidwes-Afrika en Botswana vorm, besef ons nie aldag te mooi nie. Die gebied word ook ver-keerdelik geassosieer met &#x2019;n woestyn waar daar niks plantegroei is nie, terwyl met genoeg veesuipingswater en met die regte weiveldbestuur hierdie gebied een van ons mooiste grasbedekkings vir veeboerdery kan h&#x00EA; wat daar in Suid-Afrika is. Die oppervlakte van hierdie gebied binne die distrik Gordonia is 2 176 000 ha. Van die 2 176 000 ha is 34&#x0025; totaal sonder ondergrondse water en is die veeboere in daardie dele totaal afhanklik van re&#x00EB;nwater wat in gatdamme opgevang word. Sewentien persent van die oppervlakte van die gebied is afhanklik van boorgate wat sout is en wat by tye toksies is vir die vee. Agtien persent van die oppervlakte het &#x2019;n probleemmet onvoldoende ondergrondse water.</p>

<p>Die gebied word hoofsaaklik aangewend vir die produksie van karakoelpels. Die rede waarom daar met karakoel geboer word, is, in die eerste plek, dat die karakoelskaap in die meeste gevalle sy lam nie hoef groot te maak nie omdat die lammers klein geslag word. So behou die skaap dan sy kondisie. In die tweede plek het &#x2019;n mens as gevolg van die beperking van die getalle van jou kudde die geluk dat jy jou plaas nie maklik sal oor-belaai nie. Daar is ook &#x2019;n ander belangrike rede, nl. dat die karakoelskaap oorspronklik uit die woestynstreke van Sentraal-Asi&#x00EB; kom waar dieselfde geharde toestande heers wat &#x2019;n mens in die Kalaharigebied kry. Verder is die ondervinding dat van al die skaaprasse wat daar in die Kalahari aangehou word die karakoelskaap die beste gedy op hierdie half onbruikbare water. Dit dan wat die karakoelskaap betref, maar eintlik lewer die Kalahari hom uitstekend tot die produksie van rooivleis.</p>

<p>In die verlede is daar al verskeie metodes ondersoek om water in die Kalahari te voorsien. Daar is al gekyk na ontsouting, wat tegnies gedoen kan word, maar wat onprakties en kommersieel nie-lonend is. Daar is al gekyk na die moontlikheid van die bespuiting van hierdie sandwoestyn en om re&#x00EB;nwater op te vang en in damme te lei, maar as gevolg van die lae re&#x00EB;nval, is dit ook nie prakties moontlik nie. Daar is met dieptebore probeer, maar ook daarmee is nie goeie resultate behaal nie. Wat oorbly, is dan alleenlik die voorsiening van water aan die Kalahari deur middel van pypleiding uit die Oranjerivier. Daar is al soortgelyke skemas ondersoek. Een so &#x2019;n ondersoek is gedoen deur &#x2019;n komitee onder voorsitterskap van mnr. Cox. Tydens hierdie ondersoek sowat agt jaar gelede is die koste vir so &#x2019;n skema op R11 miljoen geraam. As gevolg van kos-te-eskalasie intussen sal die koste van so &#x2019;n skema tans in die omgewing van R50 miljoen bedra. Die verblydende nuus wat ons nou van die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring verneem, is dat hulle nou &#x2019;n skema ondersoek wat veel <span class="col_939-940" refersTo="page_0497"/>goedkoper is en wat slegs &#x2019;n prim&#x00EA;re pyp-leiding behels wat na sekere aftappunte water sal voorsien waarvandaan die boere dit dan of kan ry of op &#x2019;n ander wyse verder sekond&#x00EA;r kan versprei. Ons verstaan dat die koste van hierdie skema moontlik binne die beskikbare fondse van die Staat sal wees en ook binne die vermo&#x00EB;ns sal wees van die boere wat dit sal moet onderhou.</p>

<p>Die aanl&#x00EA; van water in die Kalahari sal stabiliteit bring en sal die voortsetting van ekonomiese boerdery moontlik maak. Voorts sal die aanl&#x00EA; van water in die Kalahari meebring dat &#x2019;n mens beter weiveldbe-stuur sal kan beoefen omdat &#x2019;n boer dan meer waterverspreidingspunte sal h&#x00EA; en dus meer vee sal kan aanhou sodat die drakrag van die grond optimaal benut kan word. Omdat hierdie Kalaharigebied so geskik is vir veral beesboerdery, kan die gebied een van ons grootste vleisspense in die Republiek word. Met die voorsiening van vars water aan jou diere, kan jy ook &#x2019;n verbeterde produksie en reproduksie kry.</p>

<p>Daar was in &#x2019;n stadium &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek na die landbou wat &#x2019;n aanbeveling gedoen het wat gelui het dat die Kalaharigebied geheel en al aan boerdery onttrek moet word. Nou is ons gelukkig om te kan s&#x00EA; dat hierdie aanbeveling deur die Departement van Landbou en Visserye, en wel by monde van ons vorige Minister van Landbou, totaal verwerp is. Daar is &#x2019;n ander belangrike rede waarom daar mense in hierdie gebied moet bly woon. Dit gaan oor die saak wat ek netnou genoem het, nl. die feit dat die Republiek deur middel van die Kalahari meer as 1 000 km aan Botswana en Suidwes-Afrika grens. Ons is almal bewus van die onsekere politieke verwikkelinge in hierdie buurstate van ons. Daarom is dit noodsaaklik dat die huidige boere in daardie gebied behoue moet bly. Ek beklemtoon &#x201E;die huidige boere&#x201D;, die mense wat opgegroei het met die wel en we&#x00EB; van daardie streek. Hulle moet nie daardie gebied verlaat nie. Indien hierdie toestande sou versleg, sal die alternatief wees dat daardie gebied milit&#x00EA;r beset moet word. Dit sal alken teen groot koste kan geskied en sal ook baie onprakties wees.</p>

<p>Ons wil dan versoek dat daar tydig gekyk sal word na hierdie gebied om water daaraan te voorsien sodat daar nie verdere ontvolking sal plaasvind nie. Ek wil net kortliks vir die Komitee s&#x00EA; hoe oud-Minister Sauer die Kalahari gesien het toe dit nog &#x2019;n paradys vir jagters was. Hy het na sy jagtog &#x2019;n brief aan oud-President C. R. Swart geskryf waaruit ek nou net een paragraaf wil lees. Hy s&#x00EA;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is gelukkig geen water in die Kalahari nie. Dus hoef jy nie te was nie; jy was voor en na die tog en na die eerste week raak jy gewoond aan jou maats, veral as die wind anderkant toe waai. Dit bederwe ook nie jou brandewyn nie, want jy drink hom net so. As dit gate in jou maag brand, stop jy dit toe met gras.</block>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil eintlik op die eerste sin van hierdie paragraaf wys, nl. &#x201E;Daar is gelukkig geen water in die Kalahari nie.&#x201D; Maar onderaan die brief s&#x00EA; hy: &#x201E;Daar is gras.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Gordonia is &#x2019;n man wat sy w&#x00EA;reld ken. Hy het &#x2019;n mooi pleidooi gele-wer. Trouens, ek dink die hele Komitee verlang ook sommer nou na die agb. lid se w&#x00EA;reld.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek bedank die agb. Sweep vir die spreekbeurt wat hy aan my toegeken het. In die beperkte tyd tot my beskikking, wil ek graag vanaand praat oor &#x2019;n saak wat my na aan die hart l&#x00EA;. Dit is ook &#x2019;n saak wat die gemeenskappe van Klerks-dorp, Orkney en Stilfontein baie na aan die hart l&#x00EA;. Ek weet ek praat ook namens die agb. lid vir Stilfontein wanneer ek vanaand hierdie betoog aan die agb. Minister rig. Die aanduiding is dat die probleemook uitbrei na ander dorpe in die omgewing.</p>

<p>Dit gaan hier oor die probleemvan besoe-delde water waardeur ons in hierdie omgewing alreeds etlike jare geteister word en waarvoor daar skynbaar geen oplossing in sig is nie. Die aangeleentheid van die besoe-delde water dateer terug na Augustus 1979. Sedert verlede jaar het besoedeling van die water klaarblyklik toegeneem. Die drinkwater sowel as die verbruikswater het vanwe&#x00EB; mangaanbesoedeling &#x2019;n vuil esteties onaan-vaarbare kleur. Dit is &#x2019;n feit wat ek self ook onlangs weer ervaar het toe ek daar in my kiesafdeling was. Die saak het emosies gaande gemaak en daar is blaam gel&#x00EA; op die plaaslike stadsrade.</p>

<p>Ek wil die agb. Minister bedank vir die <span class="col_941-942" refersTo="page_0498"/>onderhoud wat hy aan my en die vorige agb. lid vir Stilfontein, mnr. Koeks Rossouw, op 11 Desember 1980 toegestaan het om die saak te kon bespreek en die ems van die probleemte kon uitwys. Ek wil hom ook bedank vir die begrip wat hy vir die probleemgetoon het.</p>

<p>Dat die vuil voorkoms van die drinkwater &#x2019;n dorstige sal afskrik, dat die water o.a. vuil wasgoed tot gevolg het, wat ontevredenheid en skade meebring, bring ook by elkeen ernstige bedenkinge oor die gesondheidsaspek daarvan. Die versekering is gegee dat dit nie gesondheidsgevare inhou nie, maar ek wil met respek s&#x00EA; dat dit &#x2019;n aspek is wat ernstige kommer wek. Inderdaad word bykans 200 000 mense hierdeur geraak. Die langter-myn-gesondheidsnadele kan nie uitgeskakel word nie. Wat die skade op die langtermyn aan die waterverspreidingstelsels pypleidings, waterinstallasies en verwarmingsappa-rate kan wees, is nie nou bepaalbaar nie, maar kan beslis ook nie uitgesluit word nie.</p>

<p>Dit kan verstaan word dat so &#x2019;n problememosies gaande maak. Dit problemse afmetings groei en die gebruik van sulke skynbaar vuil water kan naderhand baie im-plikasies tot gevolg h&#x00EA;. Agb. lede sou gemerk het dat daar in die openbare media vele berigte in verband met hierdie saak was. In ligter luim wil ek s&#x00EA; dat ek selfs gelees het dat die inname van die besoedelde water op die lange duur gevare inhou vir die mens se manlikheid en nog meer. Agb. lede sal verstaan dat dit dus vir my nodig is dat ek ook vir die wis en die onwis, te alle tye die belange van my gemeenskap op die hart sal dra. Die jongste storie in omloop in ons gebied gaan oor hierdie apparate wat in swembaddens rondkruip om dit skoon te maak. &#x2019;n Mens noem dit Kreepy Krawlies. Hulle s&#x00EA; vir my dat vier Kreepy Krawlies verlede week in swembaddens dood is van-we&#x00EB; die besoedelde water.</p>

<p>Die stadsrade doen hulle bes en wil graag skoon water verskaf, maar hulle hande is afgekap. Die probleemis dat die mangaan se voorkoms nie egalig is nie. Dit is periodiek s&#x00F3; hoog dat die water nie gesuiwer kan word nie. Boonop is daar ook nog die addisionele koste vir die stadsrade. Dit het aansienlik gestyg. Die maatskappy wat die water aan die stadsrade vir verspreiding aan die inwoners lewer, doen sy uiterste bes. Trouens, ek verstaan dat die maatskappy &#x2019;n aansienlike finansi&#x00EB;le bedrag, as ek moet s&#x00EA;, seker bykans R150 000, in die afgelope jaar aan chemikali&#x00EB;&#x2014;dit is kaliumpermanganaat&#x2014;vir die suiwering van die water bestee het. Nog is die probleemdaar. S&#x00F3; het die streekontwikkelingsvereniging van Wes-Transvaal reeds by sy jaarkongres aandag aan die probleemgegee en verto&#x00EB; daaromtrent gerig. Die streekontwikkelings-advieskomitee in Wes-Transvaal het ook reeds dringende samesprekings oor hierdie saak met die departement gevoer. Ook die ko&#x00F6;rdinerende komitee van die stadsrade van Klerksdorp, Orkney en Stilfontein het ernstige pleidooie gerig. Die departement het intussen verdere ondersoeke gedoen na die mangaanbesoedeling wat in die Vaalri-vier voorkom en wat van &#x2019;n bepaalde myn in die omgewing afkomstig is. Ek wil hier s&#x00EA; dat daar waardering is vir die werk wat die departement reeds in die verband gedoen het.</p>

<p>Tans is die probleemweer eens akuut en, soos begryp kan word, loop emosies hoog. Ek s&#x00EA; vandag die probleemis inderdaad ernstig. Vir die publiek lyk dit of &#x2019;n oplossing nie in sig is nie en of die stadsrade nie hul deel doen nie. Ek het begrip daarvoor dat dit nie &#x2019;n probleemis wat oornag opgelos kan word nie, maar terselfdertyd is ek oortuig daarvan dat die probleemnoodmaat-re&#x00EB;ls verg.</p>

<p>In die eerste plek wil ek dit beleefd aan die agb. Minister stel dat ek daarvan oortuig is dat die probleemin my geweste sodanig is dat &#x2019;n verklaring van die huidige posisie nodig is en dat daar in so &#x2019;n verklaring per-spektief gebring sal word ten opsigte van die situasie van die stadsrade en ook van die watermaatskappy en dat daar genoem sal word wie verantwoordelik gehou moet word. Ek wil daarom graag &#x2019;n beleefde dog dringende versoek aan die agb. Minister rig dat hy so spoedig doenlik die Klerksdorp-gebied besoek om die plaaslike besture te ontmoet sodat die probleemten volle toe-gelig en bespreek kan word.</p>

<p>In die tweede plek wil ek s&#x00EA; dat ek ook onder die indruk is dat daar aanduidings is dat die mangaanbesoedeling wel stopgesit sal kan word, maar dat dit teen &#x2019;n ho&#x00EB; koste sal wees en minstens twee jaar sal neem alvorens dit stopgesit sal kan word. Ek wil met respek s&#x00EA; dat dit nie aanvaarbaar sal wees nie. Die situasie verg noodmaatre&#x00EB;ls en ek <span class="col_943-944" refersTo="page_0499"/>wil beleefd pleit daarvoor dat aangesien dit &#x2019;n saak van uiterste dringendheid is, die departement in samewerking met die betrok-kenes, sal kyk na die moontlikheid, ongeag die koste, om inlaatpype in die Vaalrivier aan te bring bokant die bron van besoede-ling. Dit behoort die probleemof te ondervang &#x00F2;f minstens te verlig.</p>

<p>In die derde plek wil ek daarvoor pleit dat die addisionele koste wat &#x2019;n verdere las is op die belastingbetalers in di&#x00E9; onderskeie dorpe, simpatieke oorweging sal geniet vir &#x2019;n bydrae van die departement se kant aan hierdie stadsrade.</p>

<p>In die vierde plek wil ek s&#x00EA; dat dit wil voorkom of die mangaanbesoedeling nie die enigste vorm van besoedeling is waarteen gewaak moet word nie, maar dat dringend gekyk sal moet word na ander besoedelings-moontlikhede, o.a. die eutrofikasie van die riviere. Dit is &#x2019;n proses waardeur watersisteme deur plantvoedingsisteme verryk word met &#x2019;n gevolglike oorlasgroei van alge en waterplante. Hierdie alge teer op die kaliumpermanganaat wat die mangaan uit die water moet haal en hierdie aspek verg eweneens dringende aandag.</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN WATERWESEBOSBOU EN OMGEWINGSBEWARING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid, mnr. Theunissen, het gepraat oor hoe ons &#x2019;n infrastruktuur moet skep deur middel van watervoorsiening. Ek wil vir hom s&#x00EA; ek dink die enigste beleid wat &#x2019;n mens in di&#x00E9; verband kan volg, is dat infrastruktuurskepping deur middel van watervoorsiening eintlik hand aan hand met ontwikkeling moet gaan. Ek dink nie &#x2019;n mens sal eers die infrastruktuur deur middel van watervoorsiening kan skep en dat die ontwikkeling dan agterna moet kom nie. Dit is twee dinge wat parallel van &#x2019;n kant af moet loop. Ons het voortdurend die gebied wat die agb. lid van praat voor o&#x00EB; en ons poog om meer water daar beskikbaar te stel. Daarom kan ek nou s&#x00EA; dat die departement besluit het&#x2014;en ek het dit goedgekeur &#x2014;om langs die Limpoporivier in die gebied vanaf Beitbrug tot by die Shasirivier se inloop alle beheer op te hef en mense toe te laat om soveel daar te besproei as wat hulle moontlik kan. Dit is hulle saak; d.w.s. mits daar water is. Ons het besluit om die mense in die gebied vanaf Shasi tot by die sameloop van die Limpopo en die Mogolriviere toe te laat om besproeiing uit te brei vir &#x2019;n periode van tien jaar. Agb. lede kan nou vir my vra hoe &#x2019;n mens besproeiing kan uitbrei vir &#x2019;n tydperk van tien jaar? Die probleemis dat &#x2019;n deel van die water natuurlik aan Botswana toeges&#x00EA; moet word omdat dit &#x2019;n internasionale rivier is en ons kan nie daardie water gebruik terwyl dit miskien Botswana toekom nie. Ek dink die mense is bewus daarvan en terwyl daar nou in hierdie stadium geleentheid is om daardie water te gebruik, is hulle bereid om dit op hierdie voorwaarde te gebruik. Ons het dit so goedgekeur.</p>

<p>Na die ander riviere waarvan die agb. lid gepraat het, sal &#x2019;n mens baie ernstige ondersoek moet instel. As die agb. lid praat van ontwikkeling van die platteland en watervoorsiening in die platteland, wil ek vir hom s&#x00EA; hy moet die saak &#x2019;n bietjie bre&#x00EB;r sien en wel in die lig van my aankondiging vroe&#x00EB;r dat ek bereid is om &#x2019;n kommissie van ondersoek aan te stel na die voorsiening van water aan waterarmgebiede. Daarmee bedoel ek nie net besproeiingswater nie. Ons sal moet kyk na wat die moontlikheid is van die voorsiening van water vir besproeiing sowel as vir menslike gebruik, o.a. waarskynlik ook in daardie gebied.</p>

<p>Wat betref die pleidooi van die agb. lid vir Fauresmith, nou ja, agb. lede sal begryp dat dit &#x2019;n ou w&#x00EA;reld is wat my baie na aan die hart l&#x00EA;. Ek het baie van daardie probleme persoonlik deurgemaak; ek ken hulle. Ek dink nie die departement het afgesien van sy beleid dat sover moontlik bestaande be-sproeiingskemas instand gehou moet word of miskien &#x2019;n voorkeuraanspraak op water het nie. In di&#x00E9; lig beskou ons ook die skema waarvan die agb. lid gepraat het en in di&#x00E9; lig sien ons ook die infrastruktuur wat wel daar bestaan en sal ons steeds vorentoe ons bes vir Rietrivier doen.</p>

<p>I do not know what the position of the hon. member for Constantia was at the beginning of this year. I realize he is a new member, but I do not know whether he was really fair when he said that it was promised to place a Bill before Parliament.</p>

<p>Yes. It was placed before Parliament at the beginning of this <span class="col_945-946" refersTo="page_0500"/>year. It was considered by a Select Committee which became a commission and the Bill is now being considered by that commission. It was placed before Parliament. I am now awaiting the report of the commission on that Bill and it will then again be placed before Parliament. That is what happened. As far as the policy of the department is concerned, I think it is the responsibility of the central Government to formulate the broad environmental policy. The execution of that policy is the responsibility of the local decentralized organizations and authorities as well as that of other Government bodies. It is then furthermore the responsibility of the department to co-ordinate that policy and to ensure that that policy is effectively carried out. I do not want to say more about the Bill that is being investigated by the commission. I do not think it would be fair to do so. However, that was the idea.</p>

<p>Vervolgens kom ek by die toespraak van die agb. lid vir Queenstown. Die agb. lid het gepleit vir die gebruik van die water van die Oranjerivierskema. Ek moet vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; ek voel baie sterk daaroor dat hierdie water gebruik moet word. Of die water heeltemal so gebruik sal word soos die agb. lid voorgestel het, di&#x00E9; sal ons moet na kyk. Omdat water so skaars is, sal ons moet kyk om dit op die heel beste moontlike manier te gebruik. Maar ek stem met hom saam en ek wil dit vandag hier baie duidelik s&#x00EA; en ek dink ek het dit ook vandag aan die begin van hierdie verrigtinge ges&#x00EA;, dat ek uitsien na &#x2019;n werklik teikenbegroting, &#x2019;n teikenbegroting in die sin dat ons fondse opsy gesit sal kry vir landbouwater aan die een kant en vir industri&#x00EB;le en huishoudelike water aan die ander kant. Die huidige situasie is dat prioriteite deur die departement bepaal word, maar ook grootliks op die departement afgefor-seer word. Ek het netnou genoem dat as daar besluit word om &#x2019;n nuwe Sasol te bou daar groot hoeveelhede water benodig word. Dan moet daar &#x2019;n groot nuwe dam in die Vaalrivier gebou word, dan moet daar geweldige kanale gebou word en dan moet jy water oor die waterskeiding pomp wat miljoene en miljoene rande kos. Met ander woorde, prioriteite word op jou afgeforseer. Daarom pleit ek hier vir &#x2019;n teikenbegroting.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Gordonia, met hom het ek baie simpatie, want ek was in die Kalahari. Ek wil volstaan deur vir hom te s&#x00EA; ek het die departement gevra om die goedkoopste moontlike skema te probeer ontwerp wat &#x2019;n enkel-pypleiding is waarvan daar verskillende aftappunte kan wees sodat die boere wat by daardie aftappunte kan aanskakel, hulle eie pypleidings daarvandaan verder kan l&#x00EA;. Die hele kwessie het nie net te doen met simpatie nie. Al my simpatie is met die mense. Jy kan nie anders nie as om simpatie te h&#x00EA; met mense wat nie drinkwater het nie. Dan het hulle nie net nie drinkwater nie, hulle het ook nog &#x2019;n pragtige humorsin daarby. Terwyl hulle daar in die grootste ellende sit, het ons daar tussen hulle gestaan en toe s&#x00EA; een van hulle vir my: Minister, daardie ou wat daar langs jou staan, hy moet sy brandewyn in Upington loop drink. Ek vra toe: Hoekom? en hy s&#x00EA; toe: Hy het nie hier water om by te gooi nie. Ek s&#x00EA; toe: Maar drink hom dan maar &#x201E;neat&#x201D;, soos oom Paul Sauer ges&#x00EA; het, en hy s&#x00EA; toe: As dit so droog is, dan is daardie ding te sterk en dan brand hy naderhand deur jou maag. Ons het simpatie met daardie mense en ons sal ons bes vir hulle doen.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Klerksdorp het gepraat van die mangaanbesoedeling. Ons is bewus van daardie probleem. Ek het die gebied persoonlik besoek. Die agb. lid weet daar is destyds teenoor hom en die voormalige lid vir Stilfontein onderneem om in die begin van Desember samesprekings tussen die departement en die myngroepe te voer. By daardie samesprekings is besluit om &#x2019;n geo-hidrologiese ondersoek te doen ten einde vas te stel presies waarvandaan die besoedeling kom. Ek is meegedeel dat daardie ondersoek nou voltooi is, hoewel ek moet s&#x00EA; dat ek in hierdie stadium nog nie die uitslag van die ondersoek gesien het nie. Nadat ons die uitslag van die ondersoek onder o&#x00EB; gehad het, kan daar besluit word wat die beste metode is om te kyk of ons hierdie besoedeling kan bekamp en om daardie huisvroutjies met die vuil wasgoed weer tevrede te stel in Klerksdorp se w&#x00EA;reld. Maar ek weet nie of ons iets sal kan doen aan die Kreepy Kraw-lies nie. Was dit nou mense, het ons vir hulle nuwe harte oorgeplant, maar die Kreepy Krawlies dink ek is so &#x2019;n klein bietjie bokant ons vuurmaakplek.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. TEMPEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil &#x2019;n bietjie oor die bosboubedryf gesels. As agb. lede dit nog nie opgelet het nie, wil ek darem net aan die begin die aan-dag vestig op die agb. Minister se pragtige angelier&#x2014;hy lyk sommer mooi vanaand.</p>

<p>Die verbeterde ekonomiese toestande het vir boomkwekers en vir werkers in die hout-bedryf nog &#x2019;n bemoedigende jaar bewerkstellig. Wat die vraag na hout en houtpro-dukte betref, was die volgehoue verbeterings in die aanvraag na rondehout in feitlik alle kategorie&#x00EB; die kenmerk van die afgelope tyd. As ons kom by papierhout, moet ons vir mekaar s&#x00EA; dat papier nog lank &#x2019;n bedryf van toenemende belangrikheid in Suid-Afrika sal wees. Dit word byvoorbeeld beraam dat die jaarlikse <i>per capita-</i>verbruik van papier in Suid-Afrika teen die jaar 2000 tot plus-minus 80 kilogram sal verdubbel. As ons kyk na hoe agb. lede toegegooi word met berge van papier, dan sidder &#x2019;n mens om daaraan te dink dat ons binne 20 jaar dubbel soveel papier op ons afgegooi sal kry. Die vraag na papierhout sal dus in die toekoms aansienlik toeneem. Die nywerheidsektor in die hout-bedryf het ook reeds daarop gereageer en groot uitbreidingsplanne aangekondig. Goeie voorbedde hiervan is die nuwe pulpfabriek by Ngodwana in Oos-Transvaal, wat deur Sappi aangepak word, en die nuwe papierfabriek wat die Mondi-groep in Richardsbaai wil oprig. Dieselfde geld vir konstruksiehout. Ons het gelukkig &#x2019;n sterk oplewing in die boubedryf gehad wat die vraag na konstruksiehout sterk laat toeneem het. Die vooruitsigte vir timmerhout vir die meubelbedryf is net so belowend. Een van die groot oorsake daarvan is seer sekerlik die verhoogde lewenstandaard van veral ons Swartes en ons gekleurde bevolkingsgroep. Wat mynhout betref, sal die toekomstige aanvraag hoofsaaklik van die goudprys afhang. As die goudprys byvoorbeeld verder sou daal, sal die vraag na mynhout vir die goudmyne ook afneem, maar gelukkig kan ons s&#x00EA; dat dit waarskynlik gebalanseer sal word deur die groot vraag wat mynhout steeds sal geniet in die geweldige, uitbreidende steenkoolmynbedryf. In die geheel kan ons dus verwag dat die vraag na hout sal toeneem teen &#x2019;n vinniger tempo as in die jongste 10 jaar. Ongelukkig sal dit saamval met &#x2019;n afname in die tempo van groei wat die aanbod van hout betref.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by die kwessie van nuwe aanplantings, nuwe bebossing. Volgens &#x2019;n verslag wat in April 1979 uitgebring is, sal Suid-Afrika tot die jaar 2000 ongeveer 25 000 hektaar per jaar nuwe bebossing moet vestig om in ons eie behoeftes te voor-sien. Die aanduidings in hierdie stadium is dat ons di&#x00E9; mikpunt nie sal bereik nie. Die departement se jongste jaarverslag gee byvoorbeeld die ontstellende nuus dat vir die 1978-&#x2019;79-jaar slegs 15 800 hektaar nuwe plantasies gevestig is. Hierdie tendens&#x2014;die lae vlak van belangstelling in nuwe bebossing&#x2014;is werklik ontstellend. Ek glo dat daar verskillende oorsake daarvoor is en ek wil net twee daarvan noem.</p>

<p>Eerstens: Groot gebiede wat voorheen onder bome was, is omskep na die produksie van ander landbougewasse. Nou is dit so dat uit &#x2019;n nasionale oogpunt beskou, dit ges&#x00EA; kan word dat ploegbare grond meer produk-tief aangewend behoort te kan word vir byvoorbeeld voedselproduksie. Maar dan moet dit gepaard gaan met aansienlike aanplantings van bome in die steiler en moei-liker areas, anders sal ons nie in ons toekomstige houtbehoeftes kan voorsien nie.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Tweede faktor wat ons kan noem, is die probleemdat kostestudies daarop dui dat &#x2019;n baie lae rendement verdien word op kapitaal wat in die kweek van hout bel&#x00EA; word. Twee aspekte in hierdie verband verdien gemeld te word. Eerstens: Omdat die kontantvloei in die houtkwekersbedryf buitengewoon laag is, is dit veral vir die kleiner kweker baie moeilik of selfs onmoontlik om sy belegging in sy bedryf te hernieu. Tweedens: As gevolg van die genoemde faktore, word die bedryf steeds minder aantreklik vir ons groot institusionele beleggers. Dit is &#x2019;n probleemwat ons in die bedryf ondervind, en om hierdie probleemdie hoof te bied, l&#x00EA; die oplossing myns insiens in &#x2019;n kombinasie van die volgende stappe wat gedoen behoort te word:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) Pryse vir hout in die rondemaat moet meer aantreklik gemaak word en moet meer dikwels aangepas word om nuwe plantasies te stimuleer.</li>

<li>(b) Die bestaande leningsfasiliteite wat die Departement van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring in samewerking met <span class="col_949-950" refersTo="page_0502"/>die Afdeling Landboukrediet aanbied, moet met goeie reklame sterker gepropageer word.<br/>In hierdie opsig wil ek wys op een syfer. In die 1979-&#x2019;80-verslagjaar is aansoeke vir slegs R89 000 deur die departement oor-weeg&#x2014;slegs oorweeg.</li>

<li>(c) Die beperkings op die boomboer moet versag word. As ons kyk na die permitstelsel vir nuwe aanplantings, dan vind ons dat die kweker beperk word tot 75&#x0025; van die totale oppervlakte van sy plaas waarop hy bome kan vestig. Verder word hy verplig om onbeplante areas binne voorgeskrewe afstande van strome en vleie oop te laat en, meer nog, hy moet daardie oop ruimtes vry hou van onwenslike plantegroei. Nou besef &#x2019;n mens dat hierdie maatre&#x00EB;ls daarop gemik is om die watersponse te beskerm, maar ander verbruikers laer af, soos in my w&#x00EA;reld byvoorbeeld Evkom en Sasol, maak geen bydrae tot die boomkweker se aangegane koste of die verlies van inkomste in hierdie verband nie. Ek vra dat die Minister na hierdie kwessie moet kyk.</li>

<li>(d) Die boomkwekers het hulp nodig om die koste van spoor-en skeepsvrag te bestry sodat hulle meer mededingend kan word, veral op die uitvoermarkte. In hierdie opsig kan &#x2019;n mens noem dat studies aangetoon het dat van die totale produksiekoste van ronde-hout, tot 50&#x0025; vir die vervoer daarvan gaan &#x2014;vanaf die plantasie tot by die verwerker. Om papierhout as nog &#x2019;n voorbeeld te gebruik: 36&#x0025; van die koste van papierhout gelewer by die meul, is vir spoorvrag.</li>

<li>(e) Wat die kweker self betref, moet hy ho&#x00EB;r doeltreffendheid in plantasiebestuur verkry. Veral die groter produseerders kan produksieprosesse rasionaliseer&#x2014;&#x2019;n mens gee dadelik toe dat dit moeilik is vir die kleiner kweker om rasionalisasie met sukses toe te pas.</li>

<li>(f) Die kweker kan ook beter benutting van sy arbeid teweegbring. Kwekers kan beter gebruik maak van die pragtige opleidingsfasiliteite wat vir hulle werknemers bestaan en wat steeds van departe-mentswe&#x00EB; en andersins uitgebrei word.</li>

</ol>

<p>Meneer, vergun my ten slotte om &#x2019;n woord van ho&#x00EB; waardering teenoor lede van die Bosbouraad te betuig. Dit is &#x2019;n liggaam wat uitnemende dienste aan die hele bedryf, aan die kwekers en aan die verwerkers van houtprodukte, verskaf. Een sakie wat ek onder die aandag van die agb. Minister wil bring, is dat van die kleiner kwekers nie baie gelukkig daaroor voel dat by die onlangse aanstellings van die lede van die raad &#x2019;n vermindering van die lede in die verteenwoordiging van die kleiner kwekers meegebring is nie. Hulle is nou net vyf, teenoor sewe twee jaar gelede.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is werklik &#x2019;n voorreg om onmiddellik na my buurman, die agb. lid vir Ermelo, op die been te kom. Ek wil by hom aansluit waar hy verwys het na die pragtige angelier wat die Minister vanaand ten toon stel. Waar ons nou met die Bosboupos begin het, moes hy darem &#x201E;geswitch&#x201D; het na &#x2019;n Barberton-daisy. Dit sou meer vanpas gewees het by die bespreking van bosbou. Die grootste deel van my kiesafdeling is een van die belangrikste bosbou-areas van Suid-Afrika.</p>

<p>Dit is met opgewondenheid dat ons verneem het van die belangrike uitbreidings wat Sappi by hul meule by Ngodwana, wat ook in my kiesafdeling is, aangekondig het. Dit is nou wel in die Nelspruit-distrik, maar dit is &#x2019;n deel van my kiesafdeling. Die hout-kwekers in ons area sien uit na &#x2019;n goeie toekoms. Ek wil ook aansluit by die stellings van die agb. lid vir Ermelo oor die probleme wat die houtbedryf tans ervaar, en meer in die besonder die klein kweker. Die hele samestelling van die bedryf leen hom daartoe dat dit makliker is vir &#x2019;n groot investeerder, met groot kapitaal, om in bosbou te bel&#x00EA;. Dit is die hele opset en samestelling van die bedryf, omdat groot kapitaal bel&#x00EA; kan word vir &#x2019;n lang tydperk, terwyl die kleiner man meestal nie in staat is om op daardie basis tot die bedryf toe te tree nie. Slegs &#x2019;n jaar of drie gelede was daar redelike pessimisme in die bedryf oor sy vooruitsigte en het almal hulle bedenkinge gehad oor die werklike toekoms van die bosboubedryf. U sal u herinner dat die vorige Minister met wetgewing na die Volksraad gekom het, en dit na &#x2019;n Gekose Komitee verwys het om na di&#x00E9; wetgewing te kyk, omdat daar probleme bestaan het tussen die kwekers en die verwerkers oor prysvasstellings. Daar het groot bedenkinge in die bedryf bestaan in di&#x00E9; verband. Daar is &#x2019;n goeie kompromis gevind. Masjinerie is by wyse van wetgewing geskep om die Minister in staat te stel om &#x2019;n sekere prosedure voor te skryf waarvolgens &#x2019;n aanvaarbare <span class="col_951-952" refersTo="page_0503"/>prys bepaal kan word. Dit is egter verblydend dat dit tot dusver, volgens my in-ligting, nog nie nodig was vir die Minister om van daardie masjinerie gebruik te maak nie, omdat die bedryf as sodanig sy eie probleme bevredigend opgelos het. Ek glo dat geen Minister van Waterwese, Bosbou en Omgewingsbewaring ooit sal wil h&#x00EA; dat hy geroepe moet wees om sodanige pryse te bepaal nie. Daarom vertrou ons dat die nywerheid self, soos hy geslaag het daarin, self in staat sal wees om sy probleme op te los.</p>

<p>Ons in Suid-Afrika is meestal in ons voor-uitskouings van sake t&#x00E9; konserwatief in-gestel. Onlangs was daar ernstige bedenkinge of ons in Suid-Afrika hoegenaamd moet toelaat dat hout in die ronde-maat uitgevoer word, omdat beweer is dat ons nie genoeg voorrade vir ons eie land sal h&#x00EA; nie. Daar is ernstige besware in di&#x00E9; verband omdat daar beweer is dat ons in werk-likheid &#x2019;n houttekort in die gesig staar. As gevolg van die probleme wat die bedryf &#x2019;n paar jaar gelede ervaar het, is toestemming verleen om houtspaanders uit te voer. As ons na die jongste verslag van die Bosbou-raad vir 1979-&#x2019;80 kyk, dan vind ons hierdie merkwaardige syfers&#x2014;nog klein in vergelyking met Suid-Afrika se ekonomie, maar merkwaardig&#x2014;dat die verdienste uit die uitvoer van hout en houtprodukte gestyg het van ongeveer R3 miljoen in 1978 tot meer as R10 miljoen in 1979, en dat dit in 1979 weer eens &#x2019;n aansienlike styging van 16&#x0025; getoon het. Wat belangrik is, is dat dit hier gemeld word dat dit ook betekenisvol is dat die waarde van houtuitvoere in 1979 vir die eerste keer die waarde van die invoere van hierdie kommoditeit verbygesteek het. Dit is inderdaad &#x2019;n blye dag vir Suid-Afrika as ons in ag neem dat ons Suid-Afrika met beperkte houtvoorrade gevind het en dat deur die inisiatief van veral die Departement van Bosbou in vroe&#x00EB;r jare, ons vandag in staat is om grootliks in Suid-Afrika se eie behoeftes aan hout te voorsien&#x2014;maar nie alleen dit nie, ons is ook vandag in staat om die uitvoer-mark met sukses te betree.</p>

<p>Ek wil aansluit by die agb. lid vir Ermelo en s&#x00EA; dat alles in die werk gestel moet word om hierdie bedryf te bevorder. Ek persoonlik glo dat die groot investeerders, waarvan daar baie is, aangemoedig moet word om die finansi&#x00EB;le probleme wat daar op die pad mag wees, self te verwerk. Ek wil egter &#x2019;n beroep op die Staat doen dat, wat die klein belegger betref, daar bepaald meer gedoen sal moet word as aansporing om tot hierdie belang-rike bedryf, veral in ons deel van die w&#x00EA;reld, toe te tree. Ek glo dat die probleme wat die agb. lid genoem het, ook vir my kies-afdeling van kardinale belang is en onmid-dellik aandag moet kry. In ons area het jy die posisie gekry, en is dit vandag die posisie, dat die groot maatskappye&#x2014;en ek wil hulle nie daarvoor verwyt nie, ons is &#x2019;n vrye ekonomie&#x2014;duisende hektaar aangekoop het met die oog op aanplanting later. Die klein belegger word miskien in di&#x00E9; proses op die agtergrond gedwing. Ek glo nie dit is in belang van Suid-Afrika nie; ook met die oog op die ontvolking van die platteland.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. R. C. ROGERS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I would like to wish the Minister and his department good fortune&#x2014;and to associate myself with remarks made by other members this evening&#x2014;in managing a department which is probably unique in its responsibility towards the country inasmuch as it is one of the great producer departments. In fact, it is involved in the production of a vital part of our requirements. It is involved in the realistic production of timber and as such must have a very realistic view of the challenges to be faced in respect of this commodity and our demographic projections for the future, the great expansion of the country and what the needs of the country are. In that respect it is probably one of the most exciting portfolios, and certainly one which is going to receive a great deal of attention in this House in the years to come, particularly in respect of the question of water. There is no question at all that, as far as our country is concerned, we are going to have to spend a great deal more on research and the provision of water and the maximum utilization of our water resources. I make bold to say that in the debates of this House the provision of water and the utilization of water resources will receive a tremendous amount of attention in the future. In passing I want to mention the comprehensive and extremely valuable content of the report. I would, however, like to correct one small error for the sake of the Eastern Cape. On page 299, in Table 5.6.4, &#x201C;Fire protection costs: Catchment areas,&#x201D; the computer must have <span class="col_953-954" refersTo="page_0504"/>sneezed because there is a minor error which states the cost per hectare for the Eastern Cape as R4,40. The major effect of the error is the increase of the total fire protection cost per hectare to R7,02 instead of R2,85. People who might be working on figures in respect of fire protection costs might find themselves a little bit out on a limb. That is not the main point; I thought I would mention it just for the sake of the erroneous reflection that it might place on that particular aspect. The report as such is full of valuable information. One of these tables that gives a lead to the subject that I would like to cover is Table 5.6 on page 296. It gives the number of fires, according to cause. One notices, in fact, that fires from private properties in plantations constitute only 3 out of 153; in catchment areas, 6 out of 67. This gives a total of 9 out of 220. This is the area that I would like to cover very briefly in the time at my disposal.</p>

<p>While relations between private owners and forestry officials are extremely good and co-operation is excellent, it does not alter the principle held by us on these benches that the State should bear full responsibility for the effects of forestry activities in any area. Having access to State funds and operating for and on behalf of all of the citizens of the Republic, it is grossly unfair that the State should put the private owner adjacent to State forests or State forest land in a position of such tremendous disadvantage. Bordering on these areas is an unhappy and burdensome existence for a landowner. This must be acknowledged and given full recognition. We on these benches call for a body to review sections of the Forest Act, Act 72 of 1968, which deal with fires and the regulations pertaining thereto. Landowners adjacent to State forests and State forest lands are at a distinct disadvantage with added hazards of burnt internal fences for which no compensation is paid, total disruption of grazing systems, increased presence of vermin, additional labour requirements and additional equipment requirements, with the commensurate financial outlay in respect of all of these matters, quite apart from additional worry and expenditure of time and management. We feel that in the best interests of good and fair government, attention must be given to the unfair burden carried by this relatively small band of landowners on behalf of the entire population. Together with them and all interested parties, a new deal should be worked out which will redound to the credit of the State, and improve the existing good relations between the State and the private landowners involved, who are jointly co-guardians of South Africa&#x2019;s forest heritage. By way of an example&#x2014;by considering the change in a farmer&#x2019;s life when grazing ground is bought adjacent to him for afforestation purposes, one can clearly see the vast additional commitment pressed on him, or to which he is subjected. There is local understanding and agreements for veld boundaries, between farmers the priority consideration being the grazing requirements of livestock, but with the State the owner becomes an unequal partner shouldering the burdens I have described. Without meaning to put the cat among the pigeons in a debate of concern and constructive suggestion, it is a fact that in respect of the activities in the afforested areas or forest lands, the adjacent farmer, or landowner for that matter, carries a burden for the entire population and is, in fact, subjected to a great deal of disruption of farming systems. In essence, it is felt that all precautions required to be taken should be taken by the department and not necessarily by the farmer. I know the thinking at present is that the precaution should be taken by the farmer to cover himself; because section 23, I think, of the Forestry Act says that negligence shall be presumed unless otherwise proved. We feel that the actual disruption of farming and the burden carried by the farmer are more than sufficient justification for forestry precautions to be based on State finances and for the acquiring of equipment for the necessary services to be placed squarely on the State&#x2019;s shoulders.</p>

<p>The adjoining farmer must be motivated to be extremely involved. The State should inculcate in this person the vital role that he plays adjacent to forest lands or forests. It should not be a burdensome role that brings a negative attitude into the situation. I have knowledge of someone who has five miles of new forest boundary, and I must say that his life has changed tremendously. His situation, as a result of being a new neighbour of a State forest, is to his disadvantage, and it is a situation that I believe we should not allow to arise. That sort of relationship between <span class="col_955-956" refersTo="page_0505"/>landowner and the department is one that we should look at and, do everything possible, to remedy.</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. H. W. MENTZ</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid moet my asseblief ver-skoon as ek nie reageer op sy pleidooi vir die kleinboere wat in die houtbedryf staan nie.</p>

<p>Dit is algemeen bekend dat daar in 1969 en 1970 &#x2019;n verskriklike oorproduksie van hout was, veral wattelhout in Suid-Oos-Transvaal en Noord-Natal. Die houtbe-markingsprentjie was destyds &#x2019;n baie somber prentjie. Ek dink dit was die agb. lid vir Ermelo wat daarop gewys het dat die situasie in die afgelope tyd baie verbeter het. Hy het byvoorbeeld melding gemaak van die pulpfabrieke wat by Godwana en Richards-baai opgerig gaan word.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook wys op die uitvoer van ronde-hout en houtspaanders deur die ko&#x00F6;peratiewe vereniging. Wat die plaaslike verbruik van hout betref, wil ek net graag noem dat daar in &#x2019;n Sondagkoerant ges&#x00EA; is dat die Spoorwee van plan is om kontrakte van R21 miljoen aan te gaan om gelamineerde hout-dwarsl&#x00EA;ers van plaaslike vervaardigers in Suid-Afrika te koop. 750 000 van hierdie dwars-l&#x00EA;ers sal teen &#x2019;n bedrag van R21 miljoen aan-gekoop word, en dit sal 44&#x0025; uitmaak van die hoeveelheid houtdwarsl&#x00EA;ers wat jaarliks deur die Spoorwee benodig word. Daar word egter nie sommer op &#x2019;n lukrake manier van hierdie houtdwarsl&#x00EA;ers gebruik gemaak nie. Hulle is oor &#x2019;n tydperk van drie jaar baie deeglik getoets en daar is bevind dat hulle uitstekend is vir die doel waarvoor hulle gebruik sal word. Mynstutte word ook in &#x2019;n toenemende mate benodig. Daar word inderdaad bereken dat daar oor die volgende 10 jaar &#x2019;n toename van 33&#x0025; in die gebruik van mynstutte sal wees. Dit beteken dat daar teen 1990 3,2 miljoen ton se rondehout as mynstutte in gebruik sal wees.</p>

<p>Daar is ook die florerende uitvoerhandel in dennehoutmeubels wat onlangs sterk toegeneem het. In Oos-Transvaal is daar ook &#x2019;n projek om alkohol uit hout te verkry.</p>

<p>Ek wil net graag wys op die rol wat die ko&#x00F6;perasies gespeel het in die bemarking van hout oor die afgelope 10 jaar, in hierdie moeilike tydperk wat ons met die bemarking van hout beleef het. Ons weet dat ongeveer 30&#x0025; van die totale plantasie-oppervlakte deur die Staat beheer word. 30&#x0025; word deur individuele houtkwekers beheer en 40&#x0025; deur die groot maatskappye. &#x2019;n Mens kan dus sien dat die groot maatskappye oor die afgelope tyd die hef in die hand gehad het, en dit het die probleme van die individuele kweker veroorsaak. Die groot maatskappye was nie alleen die produsente van 40&#x0025; van die land se hout nie, maar hulle het ook self die verwerking gedoen en was die enigste mense wat hout gekoop het van die individuele houtkwekers wat dit kon lewer. Die individuele kwekers was dus aan die groot maatskappye uitgelewer en was dus in &#x2019;n baie swak posisie om vir ho&#x00EB;r pryse te beding. In Noord-Transvaal was daar die Leta-ba-ko&#x00F6;perasie, in Oos-Transvaal die Lae-veld-ko&#x00F6;perasie, in Suid-Oos-Transvaal die Transvaal Wattelkwekers se Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Landboumaatskappy, in Noord-Natal die Natalse Landbouko&#x00F6;perasie, in die Natalse Middellande en Suid-Natal, die Natalse Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Houtmaatskappy en in Zoeloeland die Zululand Timber Growers&#x2019; Cooperative. Die belangrikste funksie van hierdie ko&#x00F6;perasies is die direkte bemarking van hul lede se hout in ronde maat. In 1980 het die genoemde ko&#x00F6;perasie gesamentlik ongeveer 1,75 miljoen ton hout verkoop. Dit verteenwoordig 18&#x0025; van die totale rondehout-verkope in Suid-Afrika vir daardie jaar. Daar is baie voordele wat hierdie ko&#x00F6;perasies vir hul lede ingehou het, maar ek wil nie nou hier daarop ingaan nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag &#x2019;n oomblikkie stilstaan by die Sentrale Houtko&#x00F6;perasie se projek vir die vervaardiging en uitvoer van houtspaanders na Japan. Die produksie van houtspaanders by Cato Ridge het in 1975 begin en die vervaardigingstempo was 250 000 ton per jaar. Die onderneming het nou so groot geword dat die bedryf nou by Richardsbaai voortgesit gaan word. Daar word geraam dat die totale produksie dan sal opskuif na 700 000 ton per jaar. Ek wil nie nou ingaan op die bloed wat hulle moes sweet om al hul probleme opgelos te kry nie, maar die onderneming wat daardie mense op eie inisiatief aangepak het, het uitgeloop op &#x2019;n baie groot suksesstorie. Hulle het self hul eie mark geskep.</p>

<p>Dit bring my by die nuwe afsetsgebied vir wattelhout wat &#x2019;n geweldige invloed op die hele nywerheid uitgeoefen het. Dit het die vraag-en aanbodsituasie baie dramaties laat verbeter. Die Sentrale Houtko&#x00F6;perasie het <span class="col_957-958" refersTo="page_0506"/>hom ook met groot sukses op die gebied van behandelde pale begewe. Deur sy vereniging van paalbehandelaars bemark hy nou ongeveer 95&#x0025; van die behandelde loofhoutpale in Natal en Transvaal, en die omset is nagenoeg R8 miljoen per jaar.</p>

<p>Dit is ook interessant om te let op die sukses van die ko&#x00F6;perasie in Pietermaritzburg, die Natalse Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Houtmaat-skappy. Daardie mense het internasionale erkenning verwerf deurdat hul uitvoere die afgelope paar jaar met R4,5 miljoen toe-geneem het. Die totale uitvoeromset vir 1980 was R5,5 miljoen. Die oorvoorsiening van bloekom-en dennepulphout op die plaaslike mark en die gepaardgaande lae pryse, het daartoe aanleiding gegee dat die Natalse Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Houtmaatskappy in 1978 besluit het om die uitvoermark te betree en dit het hulle met baie groot sukses gedoen. Oor &#x2019;n tydperk van 20 jaar was daar nie &#x2019;n groot toename in hul totale verkope nie, maar in die laaste tyd het die maat-skappy se toetale verkope &#x2019;n bedrag van R16,5 miljoen opgelewer. Hul markte sluit Itali&#x00EB;, Frankryk, Mauritius, Spanje, Korea, Japan en Taiwan in. In die toekoms sal Swede miskien ook bykom.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag een of twee vrae aan die agb. Minister stel, waarop hy miskien vir my die antwoorde kan verstrek. Daar is onlangs vasgestel dat die brandbepalinge van die Boswet nie op die Staat van toepassing is nie. Ek wil net graag van die agb. Minister weet of dit wel so is. Ek vra die inligting spesifiek in verband met brandstroke langs paaie, ens. As die bepalings nie op die Staat van toepassing is nie, waarom word die Staat hierby uitgesluit?</p>

<p>Dit bring my by my tweede vraag. Die Bosbouraad plaas &#x2019;n heffing op die verkoop van rondehout, en hier wil ek weet waarom die Departement nie &#x2019;n bydrae in hierdie verband maak nie. Die Tims-opleidingsorganisasie word ook deur die Staat gebruik, en omdat die Staat ook voordeel hieruit trek, voel ek dat die Staat ook hier &#x2019;n bydrae moet maak.</p>

<p>Met die verwagte toename in die vraag na rondehout, kan die Departement nie miskien kyk na die minder konvensionele hout-bronne nie? Ek verwys na die feit dat daar op baie plase wel houtbronne is, byvoor-beeld houtplantasies wat net daar staan, &#x2019;n mens kan amper s&#x00EA; wat daar wild groei.</p>

<p>Daar kan miskien navorsing gedoen word oor die benutting van hierdie houtbronne op verskeie plase.</p>

<p>Ten slotte wil ek net graag iets verder van die agb. Minister verneem. Daar is &#x2019;n aan-sienlike hoeveelheid gomhout of bloekom-hout van &#x2019;n swakker gehalte wat beskikbaar is, maar waarvoor daar nie geredelik &#x2019;n mark bestaan nie. Kan die agb. Minister en die Departement nie miskien navorsing doen oor die moontlike gebruik van hierdie bron wat nie geredelik verkoop kan word nie?</p>

<from>Mnr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. L. MAR&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, aangesien &#x2019;n groot gedeelte van die Kruger-wildtuin in my kiesafdeling val, wil ek graag, alvorens ek by die eintlike onderwerp van my toespraak kom, die agb. lid vir Edenvale bedank vir sy onderneming vanaand om nie die voorkoms van kookssteenkool in die Kruger-wildtuin &#x2019;n politieke speelbal te maak nie. Ek wil die agb. Minister ook baie graag bedank vir sy baie gebalanseerde siening van hierdie aangeleentheid.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag praat oor die enigste bosboumuseum wat daar is, en ook aandui waarom dit so gepas is dat dit in Sabie gele&#x00EB; is. So lank gelede as 1876 is die eerste kommersi&#x00EB;le eukaliptus-en wattelbome in die Sabieomgewing op die plaas Brooklands geplant. Die eerste Mexikaanse dennebome is in 1909 geplant, en di&#x00E9; spesie bestaan vandag nog. Na die depressiejare, en met die groter toetrede van Blankes tot die bosboubedryf, het die bosboubedryf die goudmynbedryf in daardie gebied verbygesteek. Saffi het dus in 1948 sy goudmyn-en bosboubelange van mekaar geskei omdat sy bosboubedrywighede sy goudmynbedrywighede met R178 000 oorskry het.</p>

<p>Met so &#x2019;n lang geskiedenis is Sabie seker die beste ligging vir die bosboumuseum. Ek sal graag hierdie museum vanaand aan agb. lede wil voorstel. Die agb. Minister het reeds ons museum besoek. Die amptelike opening is op 17 Oktober vanjaar, maar in die voorafgaande vier maande het meer as 4 000 mense die museum besoek, en baie van hulle het van oorsee gekom. Sabie se ligging op die panoramiese kruinroete dra baie daartoe by om &#x2019;n goeie besoekerstal te verseker.</p>

<p>Die museum is &#x2019;n kultuurhistoriese museum wat by die museumdiens van Transvaal geaffilieer is. Dat daar by die publiek &#x2019;n <span class="col_959-960" refersTo="page_0507"/>groot aanvraag vir so &#x2019;n museum is, spreek duidelik uit skenkings wat oor &#x2019;n tydperk van 4 jaar ontvang is. Daar was sowat 2 000 foto&#x2019;s van geskiedkundige waarde van meer as 600 boeke en tydskrifte&#x2014;baie van hulle is baie skaars items&#x2014;en ongeveer 900 voor-werpe. Dit is alles van die publiek ontvang. Onder toesig van doktor Winkler, die kurator, is die uitstallings besonder goed aangebied. Daar is uitstallings van versteende bome en boomspesies wat hier gedy het toe die twee kontinente nog een was, maar wat vandag nog net in Suid-Amerika en Austra-lasi&#x00EB; aangetref word. Daar is ook uitstallings van ander boomfossiele wat baie oud is.</p>

<p>Daar is &#x2019;n pratende boom wat &#x2019;n storie vertel van hoe &#x2019;n boom groei. Daar is ook &#x2019;n houtidentifikasie-uitstalling en &#x2019;n uitstalling wat &#x2019;n aanduiding gee van die hardheid van verskillende boomsoorte, asook hoe hulle getoets word. Dit verleen &#x2019;n nuwe dimensie aan besoekersdeelname. Daar is ook baie voorwerpe&#x2014;te veel om op te noem&#x2014;van geskiedkundige belang.</p>

<p>Daar is 67 uitstallings, met onder meer boomfossiele wat 400 miljoen jaar oud is. Daar is ook &#x2019;n voorsaat van die hedendaagse Suid-Afrikaanse geelhoutboom wat 200 miljoen jaar oud is. Daar is ook &#x2019;n skyf van hierdie boom wat 520 jaar oud is. Daar is ook &#x2019;n handgemaakte draaibank wat in Sabie 61 jaar gelede deur &#x2019;n grofsmid vervaardig is. Dit is met die hand gedraai en is &#x2019;n wiel met ou wabande.</p>

<p>Daar is ook waterpype wat in vroe&#x00EB; tye uit boomstompe vervaardig is. Dit wys net dat die twee direktorate in werklikheid in die-selfde departement tuis hoort.</p>

<p>In die Sabie-gebied is daar egter nie net die museum nie, maar ook van die mooiste natuurtonele wat vir die publiek baie toe-ganklik gemaak is. Ek dink byvoorbeeld aan die Fanie Botha-voetslaanpad, die Mac-Mac-waterval, die Horseshoe-waterval en die Bridal Veil-waterval.</p>

<p>Daar is egter een deel van die publiek wat nog probleme ondervind, en dit is die groep wat belangstel in motortydrenne. Suid-Afrika het op hierdie gebied baie goed presteer en bied w&#x00EA;reldbekende tydrenne aan met internasionale deelname. Ek dink byvoorbeeld aan die Valvoline-tydren wat reeds aangebied is. Dan is daar in Oktober vanjaar moontlik die Hersolite-ty&#x00F3;ien, en in Februarie van volgende jaar moontlik die Molyslip-tydren. Privaatmaatskappye soos Saffi, Hunt, Luchards and Hepburn en Sappi het reeds toestemming verleen dat daar van hul paaie gebruik gemaak kan word, maar daar kan geen aaneensluitende roete gevind word wat nie verbindingspaaie oor bosbou-grond moet gebruik nie. Daar word nog probleme daarmee ondervind. Ek wil die agb. Minister vanaand vra om weer eens na hierdie mense se probleme te kyk. Ek is ten volle bewus van die probleme soos brandgevaar, maar in die tydperk Oktober tot Februarie is dit nie so &#x2019;n groot probleemnie, en daar is ook nie &#x2019;n te lange tydperk waarin daar toesig oor enige bepaalde trajek gehou moet word nie. Die tydsduur tussen die gebruik van &#x2019;n trajek deur die eerste en die laaste motor is ongeveer 1&#x00BD; uur. Daar kan gere&#x00EB;l word dat toeskouers, wat eintlik die grootste bydraers tot die brandgevaar is, van hierdie bepaalde trajekte weggehou word. Daar kan ook brandbestrydingsapparaat by die verskeie beheerpunte beskikbaar wees.</p>

<p>Ongelukke is wel &#x2019;n ander probleem, maar die trajekte is so kort dat daar gere&#x00EB;l kan word dat die trajekte vir ander verkeer afgesluit word terwyl die tydrenmotors daarvan gebruik maak.</p>

<p>Paaie kan natuurlik verniel word, veral in die re&#x00EB;nseisoen, maar ek glo tog dat die swaarvervoer wat gebruik word vir die vervoer van die hout inderdaad baie groter skade as tydrenmotors aanrig.</p>

<p>Die organiseerders sal gewillig wees om enige redelike versoeke van die Departement in ag te neem, maar met my pleidooi beklemtoon ek hierdie belangrikheid van hierdie tydrenne. Dit is baie belangrik as gevolg van die internasionale deelname. Dit is ook belangrik vir die toetsing van die motorvoertuie asook toetse in verband met die brandstofverbruik van die verskillende motors. Die organiseerders sal ook gewillig wees om sekere waarborge in verband met assuransiedekking te verskaf. Ek wil dus vra of dit enigsins moontlik is vir die departement om aan hierdie mense wat die sport wil beoefen, die reg van deurgang te verleen, want hulle kan nie &#x2019;n ander roete vind wat vir hulle geskik sal wees nie. Daar is &#x2019;n baie groot moontlikheid dat as daar nie &#x2019;n geskikte roete gevind kan word nie, hierdie tydrenne na aangrensende gebiede soos Swaziland verskuif sal moet word. Dit sal <span class="col_961-962" refersTo="page_0508"/>beteken dat baie voordele vir ons verlore sal gaan.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. K. MOORCROFT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a considerable amount of time has been spent on forestry matters, and so I should like to devote my speech to matters involving conservation. The hon. member for Nelspruit must please forgive me if I therefore do not react to the numerous questions he raised.</p>

<p>Before I go on with my speech, however, I should like to clear up a matter with the hon. Minister. It concerns the question of the Cape mountain zebra. A great number of conservationists have been alarmed by rumours of a decision by the National Parks Board to transfer Cape mountain zebras from the Cradock National Zebra Park to a game farm in Ciskei. I put a question to the hon. the Minister about this and he denied that such a transfer of animals had taken place. Let me, however, refer to two press reports on this issue, and I quote:</p>

<p>Dr. Nak van der Merwe denied in Parliament, in answer to a question from the member for Albany, that any Cape mountain zebras had been given to the Lily Fountain Hunting Farm near Queenstown.</p>

<p>The Lily Fountain Hunting Farm has now been renamed the Tsorwana Game Park. According to dr. Robinson, who is the head of the Southern Parks Board of the NPB, the National Parks Board had, in fact, agreed to donate six of these extremely rare animals to Ciskei and had offered to sell a further 14 animals to the Board. According to my information, a number of these animals are already in the Tsorwana Game Park. What is of concern to us is the fact that this is a hunting farm. I have here a brochure of that game park in which it is said, quite explicitly, that there is game and birdhunting. Inside the brochure one is given the tariffs. The hunting rates are for example R60 per day per hunter and R22 per day for non-hunters. Arms and ammunition can be hired. The hiring of fire-arms costs R5 per day and one can also hire a vehicle at R20 a day. It also lists the game that is available. One pays R50 for a springbok male and R35 for a springbok female, etc. It is therefore quite obvious that this is the way that that game park raises money. We are concerned about the fat that no less than one-tenth of the national herd of this very rare animal is to be transferred to that game park where, to say the least, the security of these animals cannot be guaranteed. I hope that the hon. the Minister will react to that. We would like to hear that his Department is going to review the whole position of these zebras.</p>

<p>This country has a proud record in the field of nature conservation, but we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We have to continue to make progress. This means a number of things. It means that we have to expand the physical area of land set aside for conservation purposes and it means that we have to improve research and training facilities so that these areas can be more efficiently managed. It also means that we have to educate members of the general public in order to make them aware of the importance of conservation and in order to gain their co-operation.</p>

<p>In the very limited time available to me I can only deal with the most important of these aspects, and that is the provision of adequate areas of land to provide viable habitats for all the species of plants and animals which are entrusted to our care, particularly those which are rare and endangered.</p>

<p>We in South Africa like to think that we have bigger and better reserves than anybody else. It therefore comes as something of a shock to us to discover that in relative terms we are not doing so well after all. South Africa has two national parks larger than 100 000 hectares, whilst a small and highly developed country like Japan has over eight. Acquiring land for conservation purposes is not easy. It is not particularly pleasant for the Government to have to expropriate property for reserves, so I would like to suggest that the Government has another look at State-owned land, i.e. land that is under its jurisdiction, with a view to perhaps transferring this land for the purpose of establishing reserves.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Queenstown is not in the House at this moment&#x2014;I know he has been here all the time&#x2014;because there is such a property in his constituency. I am thinking of the Vlekpoort reclamation area. That is an area of 18 000 hectares of marginal farming land. There are rumours afoot that this land is perhaps going to be resold to farmers. I should like to suggest, however, that the hon. the Minister <span class="col_963-964" refersTo="page_0509"/>consider the possibility of making this land available for nature conservation purposes. Perhaps the hon. member for Queenstown could be persuaded to take up the cudgels for this project.</p>

<p>As far as my own constituency is concerned, I should like to appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider making a couple of small reserves in the area available for the habitation of endangered species of the cycad family, otherwise known as the &#x201C;broodboom&#x201D;. This family of plants is for many reasons unique, not least of which being the fact that it was alive and well when dinosaurs were walking the earth. It is a living fossil. Unfortunately it has suffered heavily at the hands of collectors who have shown themselves to be absolutely ruthless in the pursuit of their collections. One species, which is <i>encephalartos caffer,</i> has been given protection in Albany, but there are other species, notably <i>encephalartos latifrons</i> and <i>encephalartos arenarius,</i> which have themselves become so depleted in the wild that they have ceased to reproduce themselves. The probleem is that these plants are dioecious, which means that there are female plants and male plants. When the plants are therefore depleted to such an extent that there are no longer plants growing close together, they cease to reproduce. They are also very slow growers&#x2014;they grow at about &#x00BD; inch a year&#x2014;and therefore are slow to reach a mature age at which they can start reproducing. Some species are also very specific in their habitats, being sensitive to extremes of heat and cold. In other words, they need specific habitats in which to grow and prosper.</p>

<p>I would suggest that the intense interest in cycads, which has been shown by collectors throughout the length and breadth of this country, would seem to indicate that reserves would be well received by both the public and by botanists and conservationists. My specific plea to the hon. the Minister is therefore that he investigate the possibility of establishing at least two reserves in the Albany district for endangered cycads, one for <i>encephalartos latifrons</i> and the other <i>encephalartos arenarius.</i> By so doing he would be rendering botanical conservation in this country a tremendous service.</p>

<speech by="#wiley">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. E. WILEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is remarkable how a debate like this can indicate that even members of the PFP can make a constructive contribution to debating in South Africa. Once they get over their obsession with colour, those hon. members can make a good contribution, and I think the hon. member for Albany has made a good contribution this evening.</p>

<p>I wish to deal with the question of sea pollution. I want to refer particularly to sea pollution in False Bay. In the first place, I want to refer to the pollution that takes place as a result of a discharge, into the sea beyond Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, of the filter refuse from the Steenbras filtration plant. For many, many years there have been protests, from the False Bay Conservation Society, from individuals and from the local authority concerned, at the discharge of the backwash of the Steenbras filtration plant&#x2019;s filter beds. That means that impurities from that filtration plant are removed from the water and discharged, in the form of filter refuse, into the sea. At the moment, at least once or twice a week, one sees a brown cloud of dirty water which is sent down the mountain from Steenbras, along an otherwise clear stream, into the sea. It can discolour the sea for many miles out. The sea currents carry it, very often in the direction of the harbour at Gordon&#x2019;s Bay and the popular beaches of Gordon&#x2019;s Bay and, to a certain extent, those of the Strand as well. This position has deteriorated in recent years, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to institute an investigation to ascertain why this is happening. It did not happen in years gone by, well certainly not to the same extent. What is going to be done about it, because this filtration plant is administered by the Cape Town City Council, and the Cape Town City Council seems to be quite unconcerned at the probleem that is caused in the sea as a result of this pollution?</p>

<p>I have in my possession a letter to the Regional Representative, reference no. 33/ 2/720, under the heading &#x201C;Complaint&#x201D;. The Regional Representative states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The only solution, a complete long-term solution, would be the installation of filter presses and regular disposal of the cake.</block>

<p>There is, however, another form of pollution that is taking place in this bay. Here I am <span class="col_965-966" refersTo="page_0510"/>referring to the discharge of various rivers, all the way around the bay, into the waters of False Bay. Many of those rivers are polluted rivers, and I want to ask the hon. Minister whether, in investigating the first charge I made, he would not also be prepared to investigate the extent of the pollution in the rivers that discharge their waters into False Bay. In addition to the discharge of the rivers, one also has the chemical waste outlets at De Beers and at Triomf and Sonchem in the Strand. Considerable amounts of industrial discharge take place into the bay on the Muizenburg side of the Strand beaches. In addition to that, there are also sewage discharges into the bay. Only last week I asked a question&#x2014;no. 187&#x2014;about how many sewage discharges take place into False Bay at the moment. I found the answer quite shocking. In the first place there are four; from the Cape Flats, from Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, from the Gordon&#x2019;s Bay municipality and from the Simonstown municipality. Do hon. members know that 100 800 000 cubic metres of sewage is discharged into that small bay every year? That is a rate of 276 000 cubic metres per day. How is this discharge taking place? In the cases of the discharge from the Cape Flats the answer to my question is that it runs down the beach in a vlei not very far from the popular Muizenberg beach. In the case of Mitchell&#x2019;s Plain, it is discharged by means of a pipe into the sea two km from the shore. In the case of Gordon&#x2019;s Bay, where many of us swim, the discharge takes place through a pipe 0,5 km out to sea. The same applies to Simonstown, where the outlet is also 0,5 km out to sea.</p>

<p>I am not by any means satisfied, as a result of the answers to these questions, that there is proper control and supervision being exercised by any of the authorities concerned. I would ask the hon. the Minister to look into this growing probleem of pollution in the bay.</p>

<p>Then you have the situation that as you drive along the coastal road from Muizenberg to the Strand there emanates, when the north wind blows, from the sewerage pans also administered by the Cape Town City Council near Zeekoevlei, the most appalling stench. Not only that, but you see on occasions near the Zeekoevlei river outlet sewerage in the raw form floating in the waves. If anybody says to me that that is not true I would ask him to come with me when I drive along that beach so that he can see whatever is discharged into the sea only takes place opposite those sewerage pans at the Zeekoevlei sewerage plant. The sewerage pans at Zeekoevlei have been a bone of contention this year. There has been correspondence from the local Ratepayers&#x2019; Association and in March this year the City Council described the problems with the stench at the Zeekoevlei sewerage farm as teething troubles. At the end of June they said that there would be corrective measures in respect of the sludge treatment and that it would be completed within one month. But as so often happens with a body such as that, the one month has turned into four months and at the end of August strong further objections were made to the stench coming from those sewerage farms. In September the City Engineer writes: &#x201C;It is necessary to stockpile sludge which has not been fully digested&#x201D;. That means that you have putrification and the most appalling stench. Not only people living along the banks of Zeekoevlei are subjected to this stench, but it sometimes extends as far as Muizenberg and on other occasions as far north as Plumstead and Ath-lone.</p>

<p>What is the present position? I want to ask the hon. the Minister if his department cannot look into all these incidences of pollution as soon as possible. These people are entitled to protection. The stench is unbearable and I can testify to it myself. Many years ago&#x2014;if my memory serves me correctly I think it was 15 or 16 years ago, because I was in the Provincial Council at the time&#x2014; there was a commission of inquiry into pollution in False Bay, which was presided over by an eminent Cape Town businessman, Mr. Teddy Crean. There were other scientists and influential people&#x2014;I think Dr. Van Bonde was one of them&#x2014;who served on that commission and many of us gave evidence, as long ago as that, of the pollution and the danger of pollution in False Bay. If my memory is correct, it seems that although that report was in fact tabled&#x2014;it may have been a Provincial Council report&#x2014;precious little has been done. I, therefore, want to plead with the hon. the Minister tonight to step in and to ask his departmental officials to look into the question of the allegations I <span class="col_967-968" refersTo="page_0511"/>have made about the extent of the pollution that is taking place in False Bay and to see that something is done about it, because it is an unique bay on the South African coast.</p>

<p>By way of conclusion, I should like to bring to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention the fact that the diamond diggings that take place at Kleinsee on the West Coast are also resulting in pollution, I understand, as far as 20 miles out to sea. They have huge suction pumps there and after they have disgorged their gravel much of the mud and water is pumped back into the sea. People living in that area say that the sea for up to 20 miles out to sea is polluted. I saw only a few weeks ago at Doringbaai, one of our best crayfish areas, that pollution is taking place there too. This is not necessarily marine pollution. A certain amount of sludge is pumped into the water and there is clear evidence of it in the sea, but the pollution I want to complain about is the bulldozing that has taken place on the sea coast both to the north and south of Doringbaai. Concessions have been handed out over the years and those people have bulldozed the coast. They have left it disturbed and open and there are great big craters with hills and dales along the coast. I think it is absolutely wrong that our coastline should be polluted, because this is a form of pollution. I ask the hon. the Minister respectfully to also look into this matter.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook oor besoedeling praat. Ons het vanaand hier gehoor van waterbesoedeling, besoedeling van die omgewing en die besoedeling van parke, maar ek wil &#x2019;n paar opmerkings oor geraasbesoedeling maak. Geraas is klank en klank is &#x2019;n kommunikasiemiddel. Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek maak op die oomblik geraas sodat my gedagtes deur u vertolk kan word. Klank word as geraas ge&#x00EF;dentifiseer wanneer dit iemand pla. Ek wil dit so stel: As daar aan die oorkant van die Raad gepraat of geagiteer word, is dit eintlik geraas. Ons behoort ons nie daaraan te steur nie. Aan hierdie kant van die Raad maak ons egter sinvolle klanke. &#x2019;n Mens kan die saak dus maklik so verduidelik.</p>

<p>Hierdie is &#x2019;n interessante terrein, maar dit is ook &#x2019;n besondere terrein omdat die uitwerking van geraas net so skadelik vir die mens is as enige ander soort besoedeling. Ons het van die agb. lid vir Klerksdorp gehoor dat besoedelde water bruin en onaantreklik lyk, maar dat dit miskien nie giftig vir menslike gebruik is nie. Geraas het eintlik &#x2019;n nadelige uitwerking op die mens. Onlangs het ek een van die mooi nywerhede in ons land besoek, te wete &#x2019;n sekere teks-tielfabriek. Daar is delikate apparaat in daardie fabriek wat die stof absorbeer wat van die materiaal afkomstig is wat by die masjiene ingevoer word. Daardie stofdeeltjies kan dus nie mense se longe affekteer nie. Ek en die persoon wat my daar rond-geneem het, kon egter nie met mekaar praat nie omdat die masjienerie se lawaai so oor-verdowend was. Toe ons buite kom en weer ordentlik met mekaar kon kommunikeer, het ek hom gevra wat hulle doen om die werksmense in die fabriek se gehoor te beskerm. Hy kon my nie antwoord nie.</p>

<p>Ek wil nie h&#x00EA; dat geraas heeltemaal uitge-skakel word nie, want so iets is natuurlik nie moontlik nie. Dit sou seker ook miljoene rande beloop om so iets reg te kry. Geraas is deel van ontwikkeling. As die boer na &#x2019;n goeie lentereen sy trekker aansit om te ploeg en hy die gebrul van die enjin hoor, is daardie geraas vir hom musiek. As &#x2019;n pasgebore baba op sy boudjies getik word totdat hy skree, is dit vir die moeder en vader musiek. As Jannie sy eerste vioolles gehad het en op die vioolsnare tokkel, is dit vir sy ma musiek, maar vir haar buurvrou is dit iets anders. As my buurvrou se hond in die nag aanhoudend blaf, troos dit haar want haar hond is wakker, maar vir my is dit iets wat ek aan my plaaslike owerheid wil rapporteer.</p>

<p>Ek wil by die kwessie van geraas op ander terreine kom. Ek wil praat van geraas in nywerheidsgebiede, sakegebiede en woonge-biede. Ek wil in hierdie verband aanhaal wat wyle prof. dr. C. M. van der Merwe Brink by die opening van &#x2019;n simposium oor geraas ges&#x00EA; het. Hy het &#x2019;n oorsese gesaghebbende <span class="col_969-970" refersTo="page_0512"/>op hierdie gebied aangehaal toe hy ges&#x00EA; het&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Doctors are convinced that noise wears down the human nervous system, so that both the natural resistance to disease and the natural recovery from disease are lowered. In this way noise puts health in jeopardy.</block>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is &#x2019;n waarheid. By al die simposia wat al oor hierdie onderwerp gehou is, het hierdie feit na vore gekom, naamlik dat geraas &#x2019;n nadelige uitwerking op die mens het. Geraas verlaag of verswak ook die produktiwiteit van mense. Dit is bewys. Mense in die stedelike gebiede smag na stilte. Mense gaan soek die stilte op wanneer hulle drie weke of &#x2019;n maand lank vakansie gaan hou. Mense het &#x2019;n behoefte aan en &#x2019;n honger na stilte. Daarom wil ek vanaand aan die agb. Minister baie dankie s&#x00EA; dat voortvloeiend uit die aanbevelings van &#x2019;n loodsko-mitee wat die Suid-Afrikaanse Buro vir Standaarde in samewerking met die departement &#x2019;n jaar of wat gelede aangestel het, &#x2019;n Witskrif opgestel is waarna die agb. Minister ook vanaand verwys het. Hierdie Witskrif is tans in die hande van die Hoon-kommissie. Sekere agb. lede aan beide kante van die Raad dien in daardie kommissie.</p>

<p>In hierdie Witskrif word daar in paragraaf 4 na geraasbesoedeling verwys. Ons wil vertrou dat die kommissie baie deeglik op hierdie aangeleentheid sal ingaan. Die Witskrif gee eintlik in hierdie paragraaf leiding in die sin dat daar ges&#x00EA; word dat Staatsdepartemente &#x2019;n verpligting met betrekking tot geraasbesoedeling het. Dit is egter nie net die Staat as sentrale owerheid wat ver-pligtinge het nie, sekere terreine word aan die provinsiale owerlede toe geken en sekere verantwoordelikhede aan plaaslike ower-hede.</p>

<p>In provinsiale ordonnansies bestaan reeds &#x2019;n bepaling dat amptenare geraasbesoedeling kan bekamp. Daar bestaan byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n padordonnansie hier in Kaapland dat motor-fietse met sekere apparaat toegerus moet wees om klank te demp. Daar kan nie met &#x2019;n motorfiets sonder &#x2019;n uitlaatpyp rondgery word nie.</p>

<p>Ja, &#x2019;n motorfiets moet &#x2019;n knaldemper h&#x00EA;. Hierdie ordonnansie is egter baie vaag en die mense wat vir die toepassing daarvan verantwoordelik is, s&#x00EA; dan ook dat daardie opdrag nie genoeg tande het nie. Die ordonnansie lui soos volg&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall operate a vehicle on a public road if such vehicle causes any excessive noise.</block>

<p>Wanneer is die geraas uitermatig? Dit is baie moeilik om so iets te bepaal. Wetenskaplikes is egter baie oulik.</p>

<p>Die frekwensies van geraas, of geraas-vlakke, word in desibels gemeet. Op sekere vlakke veroorsaak geraas pyn en ek meen dat as die geraas daardie vlak oorskry daar teen &#x2019;n oortreder opgetree kan word.</p>

<p>As ons die drumpel van gehoor as nul desibels neem, dan is die telling van twee mense wat normaalweg met mekaar praat&#x2014; mnr. die Voorsitter, ek veronderstel dit sal wees soos wat ek nou met u praat&#x2014;is die telling 65. As &#x2019;n mens in &#x2019;n masjienwerks-winkel staan, is die desibeltelling 115, terwyl die drumpel van oorpyn by 120 desibels l&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>In hierdie terme gemeet, glo ek dat daar genoeg terreine is waar ons deur middel van wetenskaplike apparaat kan optree om hierdie soort besoedeling te bekamp. Dit help egter nie om op te tree nadat die skade reeds aangerig is nie. Ek wil voorstel dat met oor-hoofse beplanning hierdie departement, in samewerking met die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister, wanneer snelwe&#x00EB; gebou word of woongebiede uitgel&#x00EA; en nywerheidsge-biede aangel&#x00EA; word, voorsiening maak vir die beperking van geraas. Die harde geraas wat byvoorbeeld deur &#x2019;n lugdrukboor gemaak word, word deur die ontsnapping van lug veroorsaak. Ek dink daar is mense wat vindingryk genoeg is om hierdie probleemte bowe te kom.</p>

<p>Ons soek nie &#x2019;n doodse stilte nie. Daardie soort stilte breek die een of ander tyd vir almal van ons wat in hierdie Raad sit aan. Ons wil egter h&#x00EA; dat daar beplan moet word om geraas tot &#x2019;n minimum te beperk. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<speech by="#durr">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">K. D. S. DURR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, before I begin with what I want to say, I want to respond very briefly to what the <span class="col_971-972" refersTo="page_0513"/>hon. member for Bryanston and the hon. member for Constantia said in respect of conservation in general. I think the hon. member for Constantia said that we have made very little progress: indeed, that we have made no progress and that we do not know what conservation is all about. He made all sorts of remarks about foot-dragging, that we are not getting anywhere and that we have not even started.</p>

<p>I simply cannot let that pass, because it is just not true. I am not saying that things are perfect, because we have a long way to go. But this year has just about been the most exciting and interesting year in conservation that we have had since the War. It is the first time we have seen environmental concerns dealt with and seen in the broadest possible sense. We saw the realization in the White Paper that air pollution, water pollution, noise pollution, nature conservation and cultural and historic aspects of conservation all belong together. This has been an enormous step forward and that policy statement in the White Paper is a most enlightened statement.</p>

<p>Then we had the stabilizing of the position on Table Mountain. The problems we have had in respect of this area with regard to double jurisdiction, inter-departmental conflicts and the rest are things which developed since the last century. In the past year this position has been stabilized.</p>

<p>Langebaan is one of the most exciting embryonic national parks that we will have in this country and this is something which also got off the ground this year and is in the process of being developed. The interim management committee is sitting and they have already progressed enormously. We have also had the proclamation with regard to Rietvlei, one of the biggest concentrations of birds in the South Western Cape. We have also had the stabilization of the Maga-liesberg. We have also had the increase of the Marloth reserve by a hundredfold. So many things have happened over the past year. For the first time we addressed ourselves to the probleem of noise pollution and in terms of the proposed legislation we addressed ourselves for the first time to the probleem of solid waste disposal.</p>

<p>In spite of this hon. members say that nothing has happened and that we are dragging our feet. The only reason why the legislation which is serving before the commission is because of objections by the provincial authorities. Nobody wants to pass this kind of legislation without the widest possible consultation. It was, therefore, felt that people should be consulted before the legislation is passed by Parliament. That is the reason. There was no question of foot-dragging. I, therefore, feel that those remarks were uncalled for and not correct and that I could not let them pass.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we welcome very much the fact that the department&#x2019;s name has been changed to the Department of the Environment. May I say that environment sounds better than the Department of Environmental Affairs, but I leave that matter of the translation there for the moment. It is my feeling, and I would like the hon. the Minister to give it his attention, that where we will have two directorates within the department, the one for Water Affairs and the other for Forestry, could it not be that we could consider having a third directorate as well, namely a directorate for the environment? We do not want to talk too much about the proposed legislation at the moment, because the matter is being considered by the commission, but if that proposed legislation were hypothetically to come before us in something like its present form we would then have the situation that the Director-General would be the executive officer of that council. He would be hard-hit to perform an executive function within that council in the light of all his other responsibilities. If, however, we could have a separate directorate dealing with this matter, or one appointed by the Director-General, such a director could be the chairman of that council. The we would have our own Directorate of the Environment. I leave that to the hon. the Minister to consider. I know that this will entail other considerations as well.</p>

<p>I want to say that other things have happened over the past year which have been very exciting. We have had not only the increasing co-operation by departments of State and the recognition of where a commonality of interest is, but we have also had a certain amount of rationalization in the department. Certain sections have been rationalized and certain legislation is now being administered by the department, for <span class="col_973-974" refersTo="page_0514"/>example certain marine legislation. We have had the rationalization which has brought the National Parks Board under this department. The hon. member for Bryanston said that this Department of the Environment should resort under the Office of the Prime Minister, but one of the major elements in protecting the environment is controlling the habitat. We know that the Department of Forestry controls something like 5&#x0025; of the land surface of the country, certainly more than the provincial councils and national parks boards together. In Natal the Department of Forestry controls more land than what the Natal Parks Board does, and in the Cape Province perhaps five or six times more than what the local nature conservation bodies own.</p>

<p>Certainly it is true that our environmental control should be part of the planning function, and that the planning function should be closely integrated. That is certainly true, for the reason that one wants to be able to move in advance of the conflict and not find yourself in a position where there is an area of conflict as we have seen at Sandy Bay and so many other places without provision having been made for it. In the decision-making regarding the allocation of land, the physical planning and environmental concerns should be uppermost in the minds of the people doing that kind of planning. That can be arranged by simply delegating certain functions through this department.</p>

<p>The fact is, however, that we have made a giant leap forward over the last year and I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and say to him that we appreciate it very much. I do not think that there has been a time when the environmental lobby as such outside has been so impressed by what has been happening in Government circles. I want to thank him also for the sensitivity that he has brought to environmental concerns. Many people have fears about what might happen in the Kruger National Park. I am also opposed to development in the Kruger National Park. The kind of responsible attitude and sensitivity the hon. the Minister has shown in this regard, is something we all appreciate very much.</p>

<p>In the short time still available to me I should like to make just one practical suggestion. We will not succeed to conserve the environment in South Africa unless all the people of Southern Africa wish to conserve the environment of Southern Africa. Unless we also involve other peoples and Governments in Southern Africa in conservation in general, we are going to fail. I would like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that where we have had the historic meeting in April between the TBV countries and ourselves and have taken the first step towards confederation, and where I know that there is a nature conservation working group as one of the functional committees of that embryonic confederation, that we put everything we can into that nature conservation working group and perhaps build it out to an environmental working group which has conservation as an element of what it does, so that we can have environmental planning on a co-ordinated basis in Southern Africa. They say that only the affluent can get rid of the effluent. Well, it is so that we are the affluent in Southern Africa, and it is so that if we are going to deal with the effluent and the environmental stresses that will occur increasingly in Southern Africa, we are going to have to take the lead and we are going to have to pay for it and bring the understanding to people who might otherwise not have the understanding.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek volg graag my kundige vriend, die agb. lid vir Maitland, op. Dit is vir ons almal duidelik dat hy die hele kwessie van omgewingsbewaring baie sterk op die hart dra en dit is iets waarvoor ons hom baie dankbaar is. Ek wil hom ook volg deur te reageer op sekere stellings wat die agb. lid vir Bryanston vroe&#x00EB;r vandag in hierdie debat kwytgeraak het oor die kwessie van grondbewaring.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het aangehaal uit &#x2019;n brief van die bekende Oom J. P. van der Merwe, die voormalige Direkteur van Grondbewaring. Dit was my voorreg om as &#x2019;n voorligtingsbeampte in die Departement van Landbou te dien terwyl oom J. P. van der Merwe nog gedurende sy laaste jare Direkteur van Grondbewaring was. Die agb. <span class="col_975-976" refersTo="page_0515"/>lid het op &#x2019;n baie emosionele wyse syfers aangehaal om te illustreer hoeveel grond jaarliks see toe spoel. Ek meen hy het ges&#x00EA; dat sewe rye vragmotors wat reg om die w&#x00EA;reld strek, benodig sal word om hierdie grond weg te ry. Hy het ook die Regering daarvan beskuldig dat hy absoluut niks doen in verband met grondbewaring nie.</p>

<p>Ek dink dit is heeltemal onverantwoorde-lik om so &#x2019;n stelling in hierdie Raad te maak. In die kort tyd wat ek hier is, het ek al geleer dat die agb. lid daarvan hou om &#x2019;n politieke trapskrum van enigiets te maak en dat hy graag wil h&#x00EA; dat ons aan so iets moet deelneem en daarop moet reageer. Ek wil my egter nie oor hierdie belangrike aange-leentheid my met hom in &#x2019;n trapskrum begewe nie, maar ek dink nie dat die ware feite in hierdie verband van die Raad weer-hou kan word nie. As &#x2019;n voorbeeld of bewys dat die Regering niks in verband met grondbewaring doen nie, het die agb. lid ges&#x00EA; dat die bedrag wat jaarliks deur die Regering aan grondbewaring bestee word, aan die afneem is. Dit is darem mos &#x2019;n bekende beginsel in die voorligtingswetenskap dat een van die groot take van hierdie wetenskap is om sekere boerderypraktyke onder boere aanvaar te kry. Een van hierdie uiteenlopende praktyke is di&#x00E9; van bewarings-boerdery. Die maklikste manier om dit te stimuleer, is om sekere praktyke wat jy graag gevestig wil kry, te subsidieer sodat mense ook &#x2019;n finansi&#x00EB;le voordeel daaruit kan haal. Op een item, die subsidi&#x00EB;ring van kam-pheinings was die subsidie in &#x2019;n tyd byvoor-beeld so hoog as 65&#x0025;. Daarna is die subsidie tot 50&#x0025; verlaag en ek meen dat dit deesdae net 25&#x0025; is. Die subsidie het verminder omdat kampheinings as &#x2019;n aanvaarde metode van doeltreffende weiveldbestuur posgevat het. Ek was bevoorreg om self by baie van hierdie voorligtingsprogramme betrokke te wees. Ons het geweldige vordering met velden grondbewaring gemaak. Ek kan dit ook met syfers bewys. Ek weet dus nie waar die agb. lid vir Bryanston aan sulke syfers kom nie. Ek ken ook vir Oom J. P. van der Merwe, en ek wil vir die agb. lid s&#x00EA; dat hy baie meer opruiende toesprake gelewer het as wat hy briewe geskryf het. As die agb. lid volgende jaar weer emosioneel wil raak om &#x2019;n grondbewaringsaksie te demonstreer &#x2026;</p>

<p>Aangesien die agb. lid van emosionele woorde hou, moet hy &#x2019;n boek gaan lees van &#x2019;n bekende Amerikaanse grondbewaringswetenskaplike. Die titel van die boek is <i>The Rape of the Earth,</i> en dit is iets wat miskien vir die agb. lid van groter emosionele betekenis is as die sewe rye vragmotors wat nodig sal wees om die grond weg te ry.</p>

<p>Ek wil graag na &#x2019;n ander aspek verwys en dit is die Witskrif oor die Nasionale beleid insake Omgewingsbewaring ten opsigte waarvan &#x2019;n kommissie aangestel is om die hele omgewingsbewaringskwessie te ondersoek. Die Kommissie se opdrag is om die hele departement se taak te sien in die totale konteks van ons omgewing. Die agb. lid vir Bryanston het gepraat van ons totale omgewing en dit is juis waarom dit gaan, die benutting van die totale hulpbronne wat tot die mense se beskikking is. Dit is die oor-hoofse benadering wat in hierdie Witskrif uitgespel word, maar as ons na spesifieke fasette kyk, soos byvoorbeeld die kwessie van bodembeskerming, moet ek in alle be-skeidenheid s&#x00EA; dat hier &#x2019;n leemte bestaan en ek dink die Kommissie moet in hierdie verband baie dringend na hierdie saak kyk en ek vra ook die agb. Minister om baie dringend daarna te kyk.</p>

<p>Dit gaan hier vir my oor die impak wat toekomstige verstedeliking op ons land se hulpbronne en veral op ons landbougrond sal h&#x00EA;. Die benutting van landbougrond in die toekoms word nie beskou as &#x2019;n belangrike faset waaraan die Kommissie aandag moet gee nie, maar daar word wel verwys na grondbewaring en die funksie wat die departement in hierdie verband sal h&#x00EA;&#x2014;al is dit maar net ko&#x00F6;rdinerend&#x2014;aangesien die Departement van Landbou en Visserye <span class="col_977-978" refersTo="page_0516"/>kragtens die Grondbewaringswet al die aspekte verbonde aan grondbewaring administreer. Die beplanningsaspek van die benutting van landbougrond word behartig deur die tak Fisiese Beplanning van die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister en die admini-strasie daarvan word onderneem deur die Deparement van Landbou en Visserye oor-eenkomstig die bepalings van die Wet op die Onderverdeling van Landbougrond. Dit wil my voorkom asof dit onafwendbaar is dat daar uiteindelik &#x2019;n ko&#x00F6;rdinerende liggaam moet wees wat die hele bewaringsaksie sal moet ko&#x00F6;rdineer vir die verskillende instansies wat daarby betrokke sal wees. Hierdie ko&#x00F6;rdineringsliggaam sal baie deeglik aandag moet skenk aan die benutting van die kritieke klein hoeveelheid ho&#x00EB;potensiaal-landbougrond waaroor land beskik. Moont-lik kan ek enkele syfers verstrek om die situasie te verduidelik. Suid-Afrika beslaan min of meer 100 miljoen hektaar. Twaalf miljoen hektaar hiervan kan onder die ploeg gebring word, maar slegs 4 miljoen hektaar, d.w.s. 4&#x0025; van ons land se totale landbougrond kan as ho&#x00EB;potensiaal-landbougrond beskou word. Hierdie grond is veral in die oostelike gedeelte van die land gele&#x00EB; waar die re&#x00EB;nval hoog is en waar &#x2019;n mens diep, vrugbare gronde kry. Die vraag is waar toekomstige verstedeliking gaan plaasvind? Uit die aard van die saak is dit onafwendbaar dat toekomstige verstedeliking ook in die oostelike gedeelte van ons land sal moet plaasvind. Stedelike gebiede beslaan vandag in Suid-Afrika ietwat meer as 2 miljoen hektaar, d.w.s. 2&#x0025; van die totale oppervlakte. Die infrastruktuur soos spoorlyne, paaie en lughawens, beslaan ietwat minder as 2 miljoen hektaar. Gesamentlik beslaan hierdie twee elemente dus ook ongeveer 4 miljoen hektaar.</p>

<p>As ons vooruitskattings maak, is dit duidelik dat die bevolking van hierdie land teen die jaar 2000 sal verdubbel. As ons in aanmerking neem dat die Swart bevolking in &#x2019;n groter mate in die toekoms gaan verstedelik, beteken dit dat ons dubbel soveel grond as vandag gaan nodig h&#x00E8; vir verstedelikingsdoel-eindes teen die jaar 2000. Dit dui daarop dat die twee elemente wat beide in die oostelike gedeelte van die land gele&#x00EB; is, te wete, die 4 miljoen hektaar ho&#x00EB;potensiaal landbougrond en die stedelike ontwikkeling, uiteindelik met mekaar gaan meeding en hierdie grond is iets wat ons nooit weer gaan terugkry nie. Moontlik kan ek ook na &#x2019;n plaaslike faset verwys. In Bloemfontein beslaan die stedelike gebied 20 000 hektaar en ons het so pas 10 000 hektaar aangekoop vir toekomstige Swart verstedeliking. Weens die feit dat ons baie min grond het om toe te voeg vir die Suid-Sotho&#x2019;s van die Vrystaat, verwag ons dat verstedeliking daar op &#x2019;n nog groter grondslag gaan plaasvind as in die res van die land. Dit beteken dus nog swaarder druk op die landbougrond. Ek meen nie dat dit in die toekoms nadelig sal wees indien ho&#x00EB;potensiaal-landbougrond wat binne &#x2019;n stedelike gebied voorkom so ontwikkel word dat ons &#x2019;n plaas binne &#x2019;n stedelike gebied het nie. Moontlik kan dit ook dien as &#x2019;n long om die besoedelde lug te suiwer. Ek meen nie dat die kommissie en die ko&#x00F6;rdinerende liggaam wat sekerlik gaan ontstaan, hul moet laat mislei deur hierdie fasette nie en hulle moet beslis dringend hieraan aandag gee. Ons sal dit baie waardeer indien die agb. Minister en die kommissie van ondersoek baie ernstige aandag sal skenk aan die uitwerking wat stedelike ontwikkeling op ons toekoms kan h&#x00EA;.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid, dr. Odendaal, het &#x2019;n wesenlik belangrike aspek van bewaring hier bespreek, naamlik die inherente botsing tussen bewaring en ontwikkeling. Ek hoop egter dat hy my sal verskoon indien ek hom nie verder in daardie verband volg nie.</p>

<p>Dit is vandag algemene kennis en selfs gemeenplaas dat ons lewende marine bronne onder groot druk verkeer en oorontgin word. Erger nog, daar is geen tekens dat die kommersi&#x00EB;le ontginners tot hierdie besef gekom het nie en daar word dus vanself-sprekend geen maatre&#x00EB;ls deur hulle getref om hierdie kortsigtige en selfvernietigende praktyk rasioneel, wetenskaplik en dus verantwoordelik te benader nie. Die feitlike bewyse vir hierdie bewerings is maklik be-kombaar en bo enige verdenking. Die syfers vertel hul eie verhaal, soos ook bevestig word deur die vangstesyfers wat jaar na jaar daal en ek wil byvoeg dat hierdie syfers baie goed gedokumenteer is. Ek wil graag aanhaal uit die Treumicht-verslag wat onlangs ter Tafel gel&#x00EA; is. In paragraaf 8 op bladsy 2 van daardie verslag word die volgende ges&#x00EA; onder die opskrif &#x201E;Overfishing&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_979-980" refersTo="page_0517"/>There is, however, one incontrovertible fact which emerges from nearly all the evidence available, namely that in the fishing industry we are dealing with limited resources which have been harmed by uncontrolled and excessive exploitation and which will no longer be capable of supporting even a profitable fishery.</block>

<p>&#x2019;n Absolute voorvereiste vir die behoorlike en beplande ontginning van ons lewende marine bronne is &#x2019;n behoorlike wetenskap-like studie van hierdie organismes en ook hul onderlinge verwantskap. Dit is alleen moontlik indien hierdie seelewe in hul ongeskonde en ongesteurde natuurlike staat toeganklik is vir wetenskaplike ondersoek. Dit impliseer die stigting van natuurreservate in die see, marine reservate waar volledige habitatbeskerming aan die seelewe gebied kan word. Die stigting van marine reservate is dus dringend noodsaaklik, nie net om suiwer wetenskaplike of selfs estetiese redes nie, maar om gesonde ekonomiese redes. Ek wil weer uit dieselfde verslag in hierdie verband aanhaal en wel onder die hoof &#x201E;Management Strategy&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The living marine resources are renewable and our managerial strategy must be based on thorough research and careful exploitation so that the maximum sustainable yield of the resources will never be exceeded. All parties concerned in the exploitation of the living marine resources, the authorities, the industries, the fishermen and the public, must co-operate so as to derive the maximum benefit from the resources, provided that these resources shall remain unimpaired as a heritage for posterity.</block>

<p>Daar bestaan in die Republiek vandag slegs een nasionale marinereservaat, naamlik die Tsitsikama-seekus Nasionale Park. Hierdie reservaat het in September 1964 tot stand gekom en dit is die eerste van sy soort in Afrika. Die kuslyn van die reservaat is ongeveer 80 kilometer lank en die seewaartse grens is 800 meter van die laagwatermerk gelee. Geen kommersi&#x00EB;le eksploitasie van enige aard word hier toegelaat nie. Ongelukkig tref dit so dat die see-oppervlak van hierdie reservaat heeltemal onvoldoende vanuit &#x2019;n bewaringsoogpunt is en dus nie tans kan dien as nuttige wetenskaplike ondersoekveld nie. Dit is dus sorgwekkend om dr. G. A. Robinson, die hoof van Suidelike Parke, se artikel &#x201E;Marine parks: What future?&#x201D; in die jongste uitgawe van <i>African Wild Life</i> te lees. Ek haal aan&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For three years now the National Parks Board has been battling to have the Tsitsikama coastal National Parks seaward boundary extended to five kilometres from the coast. The request is a straightforward one. To anyone with the slightest interest in conservation, the extension is commonsense, yet for three years all efforts have been frustrated. Today the scheme is threatened by total failure.</block>

<p>Dr. Robinson wys verder in hierdie artikel daarop dat die pogings om die park see-waarts uit te brei deur kommersi&#x00EB;le belange gefrustreer word. Sterk motivering vir die vergroting van die park word in genoemde artikel vermeld en hierdie redes en bykom-stige motiverings is opgeneem in amptelike verto&#x00EB; wat in hierdie verband gerig is. Ek wil net na &#x2019;n paar van hulle verwys. Sommige van ons bedreigde visspesies soos die rooi steenbras en die dageraad, beide van kommersi&#x00EB;le belang en natuurlik ook baie gesogte hengelvis, sal hierdeur habitatbeskerming kan geniet. &#x2019;n Beskermde kusstrook van 5 km sal van die Tsitsikama-seekus Nasionale Park &#x2019;n volwaardige marine reservaat maak wat sal voldoen aan al die internasionale vereistes vir parke van hierdie aard. Die huidige strook van 800 meter steek swak af by ander marine parke van naam. Die huidige grense van 800 meter is so naby die kus gele&#x00EB; dat dit prakties onmoontlik is om te verhoed dat die seelewe daar kommersieel ge&#x00EB;ksploiteer word. &#x2019;n Boot moet feitlik strand voordat daar wetlik teen hom opgetree kan word. Daar is ook talie relatief vlak banke en riwwe waarop tans wetenskaplike ondersoeke gedoen word en deur die uitbreiding van die grense sal hierdie riwwe en rotse beskerming kan geniet. Dit is verder ontstellend om te moes vasstel dat die Eerste Minister se Hulpkomitee vir Kusge-biede op 15 Januarie 1979 sonder teenstem besluit het om aan te beveel dat die seewaartse grens van 0,8 kilometer na 5 kilometer uitgebrei moes word, maar tot dusver sonder enige sukses. In die lig hiervan wil ek graag die agb. Minister versoek om <span class="col_981-982" refersTo="page_0518"/>ernstige samesprekings met die agb. Minister van Landbou en Visserye te hou en hom te oortuig van die dringendheid en noodsaak-likheid van hierdie basies element&#x00EA;re versoek van die park.</p>

<p>Die vergroting van die Tsitsikama-seekus Nasionale Park is egter nie net weens vermelde redes nodig nie, want ons moet ook kyk na die implikasies indien dit nie geskied nie. As ons eerste marinereservaat nie &#x2019;n lewensvatbare see-oppervlak gegun word nie, sal &#x2019;n baie gevaarlike presedent geskep word. Dit is dan hoogs te betwyfel of enige ander noemenswaardige marine reservaat ooit geproklameer sal kan word. Gevestigde kommersi&#x00EB;le belange langs die Tsitsikama-strook is sekerlik kleiner van omvang as langs enige ander stuk kus van vergelykbare grootte in ons land, en boonop is hierdie gebied baie yl bevolk. Op land is daar &#x2019;n ongerepte stuk natuur van unieke karakter en weergalose skoonheid. Hier vind stinkhout, geelhout en melkhout, om maar net enkeles te noem, &#x2019;n tuiste tot feitlik teenaan die rotse van hierdie pragtige kuslyn. Die streek se grootste enkele bate is sy natuur-like parkatmosfeer. Dit is &#x2019;n wildemisgebied in sy suiwerste vorm met sy ongeskonde skoonheid. Gelukkig vir ons is uitbreiding op landboukundige en stedelike gebiede baie beperk. Die kommersi&#x00EB;le ontginning van vis-bronne geskied van so ver as Plettenbergbaai en Algoabaai en dit is basies onekonomiese ontginning. Vergelyk hiermee die Weskus, met sy bestaande visnywerheid, kusmyne en stedelike groeipunte. As die huidige Tsitsi-kama-seekuspark nie vergroot kan word weens kommersi&#x00EB;le druk nie, lyk die vestiging van &#x2019;n marine reservaat langs die Weskus&#x2014;&#x2019;n gedagte wat reeds op ho&#x00EB; vlak amptelik ondersteun was&#x2014;na &#x2019;n totaal onbereikbare ideaal. Ek is seker dat almal wat hierdie pragtige park en sy skilderagtige omge-wing ken, sal instem tot hierdie baie logiese stap om sodoende &#x2019;n baie suksesvolle nasionale park beter tot sy reg te laat kom.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">T. G. ALANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, ek wil graag op die agb. lid vir Uitenhage in sy pleidooi vir die bewaring en beplande benutting van die seelewe volg; ons is dit seker almal met hom in hierdie verband eens. Ek wil ook graag verwys na die bydrae van die agb. lid vir Maitland. Hy het twee punte uitgelig waarmee ek myself spesiaal wil vereenselwig. Eerstens, glo ek dat daar &#x2019;n direktoraat vir omgewingsbewaring ingesluit moet word onder hierdie nuwe departement. Tweedens het hy verwys na moont-like mynbedrywighede in die Krugerwild-tuin, en ek wil graag ook my dank teenoor die agb. Minister uitspreek vir sy houding in hierdie verband. Ek wil die hoop uitspreek dat daar baie water in die see gaan loop voordat enige mynbedrywighede in die Kruger-wildtuin sal plaasvind.</p>

<p>Ek wil vanaand een en ander s&#x00EA; oor die omgewingsaspekte van kernenergie. Ek wil begin deur te verwys na die uitwerking wat die eerste spoorlyne in Engeland gehad het op die ontwikkelende industri&#x00EB;le samelewing van daardie tyd. &#x2019;n Mens kan s&#x00EA; dat di&#x00E9; uitwerking niks minder was as &#x2019;n sosiale revolusie nie. Die spoorlyne was die mens se eerste groot tree in &#x2019;n poging om die effek van tyd en afstand in sy kommunikasie uit te skakel. As sulks was die uitwerking daarvan op die samelewing van die 19e eeu op daardie tydstip nie kleiner as wat die uitwerking van die motor, die radio en die telefoon in &#x2019;n later stadium op die menslike samelewing sou wees nie. Dit is interessant om te let hoe die Engelse samelewing omstreeks 1825 teenstand gebied het teen die invoer van die stoomlokomotief en die bou van die eerste spoorlyne. Ek wil graag aanhaal uit die <i>Afrikaanse Kinderensiklopedie,</i> Vol. 3, bladsy 145&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is beweer dat die lokomotiewe sou bars en die mense die ewigheid in sou slinger, dat die snelheid die passasiers sou laat sterf, dat huise aan die brand sou slaan, dat wol op die skape sou verskroei, dat vo&#x00EB;ltjies wat naby die treine vlieg, dood sou neerval, ja, dat die koeie se melk vergiftig sou word en die beeste sou vrek.</block>

<p>Ofskoon bittereinders destyds die ingebruikneming van lokomotiewe en spoorlyne hand-en-tand beveg het, is dit tog baie interessant om te sien dat baie min mense dit kon bekostig om, nadat die spoorlyne gebou is, nie daarvan gebruik te maak nie.</p>

<p>In die tyd waarin ons leef, het die unieke karakter van kernkrag as &#x2019;n bron van radio-aktiwiteit en sy potensiaal vir vernietiging, in baie lande aanleiding gegee tot die groei van teenstand teen kernkrag. Hierdie weerstand <span class="col_983-984" refersTo="page_0519"/>word gebied teen baie aspekte van kemkrag en ek wil na &#x2019;n paar daarvan verwys. Sommige van hierdie aspekte is reaktorveilig-heid, die moontlike gebruik van kernmateriaal vir milit&#x00EA;re of terroristiese bedrywig-hede, die veilige opberging van hoogs radio-aktiewe materiaal en die veiligheid van snelkweekreaktore. Ook hier in Suid-Afrika waar die voltooiing van die eerste kommer-si&#x00EB;le kemkragreaktore by Koeberg tans voltooiing nader, stel die gewone man dikwels vrae in verband met kernveiligheid. Ek vind glad nie fout daarmee dat vrae gestel word nie, maar &#x2019;n mens wil graag waarsku teen die stimulering van idealistiese verwagtinge dat &#x2019;n owerheid die verpligting het om die publiek in te lig oor alles wat hy doen. Voorts moet &#x2019;n mens ook waarsku teen die hand-hawing van onrealistiese veiligheidstan-daarde.</p>

<p>Die feitelike posisie in verband met kemkrag is dat dit die enigste bekende lang-termynbron van elektriese energie is. In die meeste Westerse lande is dit so dat &#x2019;n mens elektrisiteit kan opwek met behulp van kemkrag teen ongeveer die helfte van die koste verbonde aan kragopwekking met steenkool, en teen &#x2019;n derde van die koste om elektrisiteit met olie op te wek. Desnieteen-staande vind ons dat hoewel die kernnywer-heid in lande soos Frankryk en Japan &#x2019;n bloeitydperk beleef, in &#x2019;n ander groot land soos die V.S.A., wat na die Tweede W&#x00EA;reld-oorlog die voorloper was in die poging om kemkrag vir kommersi&#x00EB;le doeleindes aan te wend, die kernnywerheid feitlik tot stilstand gekom het. Agitasie teen kemkrag in die V.S.A. het &#x2019;n baie besliste bydrae hiertoe gelewer. Die feit dat die gewone man in lande met &#x2019;n sentraalbeheerde ekonomie weinig invloed het op regeringsbesluite, is moontlik die rede waarom sulke lande ongesteurd voortgaan met hul kernenergie-programme.</p>

<p>Ek wil ook iets s&#x00EA; oor nywerheidsrisiko. Enige menslike aktiwiteit hou &#x2019;n risiko in vir die menslike lewe of gesondheid. Hoewel dit moontlik is om sulke risiko&#x2019;s te verminder, is dit nie moontlik om &#x2019;n toestand van zerori-siko of absolute veiligheid ooit te bereik nie, soos dikwels ge&#x00EB;is word. Daar is vandag egter &#x2019;n w&#x00EA;reldwye neiging&#x2014;sover dit kernenergie betref&#x2014;om te eis dat die risiko na die zerovlak verminder moet word. In die verlede is die blootstelling aan industri&#x00EB;le risiko&#x2019;s geleidelik verminder totdat &#x2019;n aan-vaarbare vlak bereik is.</p>

<p>Wat die kommersi&#x00EB;le aanwending van kernkrag betref, spog die nywerheid met &#x2019;n onge&#x00EB;wenaarde veiligheidsrekord. In byna 25 jaar van die kommersi&#x00EB;le aanwending van kernkragstasies, is niemand nog beseer of gedood as gevolg van &#x2019;n kemongeluk nie. Selfs in die geval van die mees ernstige ongeluk&#x2014;di&#x00E9; by Three Mile Island&#x2014;is niemand beseer of gedood nie en word geen nage-volge vir die publiek voorsien nie.</p>

<p>Moderne tegnologiese stelsels laat die moontlikheid van hipotetiese ongelukke waarvan die omvang so groot is dat &#x2019;n mens dit skaars kan voorsien, en dit kan onaan-vaarbaar wees vir die samelewing. Sulke hipoteteses gaan van die veronderstelling uit dat as iets skeefloop, &#x2019;n geweldige ongeluk kan plaasvind wat &#x2019;n ewe geweldige ramp tot gevolg kan h&#x00EA;. Die toepaslike risikovlak vir die samelewing is nie bepaalbaar op grond van ondervinding nie. Die owerheid neem dan hul toevlug tot voorspellingsmetodes om hierdie risiko&#x2019;s te evalueer. Die resultate van sulke risiko-ontledings toon altyd dat &#x2019;n mens die risiko verder kan verminder deur meer geld aan beveiliging te bestee. As &#x2019;n mens byvoorbeeld &#x2019;n sekere vlak van beveiliging bereik het, kan jy altyd die beveiliging verder verbeter deur meer geld te bestee. Die koste-voordeelverhouding moet natuurlik altyd in gedagte gehou word. Die algemene risiko-filosofie wat gevolg word, is di&#x00E9; wat in Engels genoem word ALARA, die akroniem vir As Low As Reasonably Achievable.</p>

<p>Die taak van &#x2019;n lisensi&#x00EB;ringsowerheid, soos in ons land waar dit geplaas is onder die Raad op Atoomkrag, is om te verseker dat die teenwoordigheid van &#x2019;n kernkragstasie nie wesenlik sal bydra tot die normale risiko&#x2019;s waaraan &#x2019;n samelewing in elk geval blootgestel is nie. Ek wil graag enkele statistieke aanhaal in verband met risiko&#x2019;s waaraan ons samelewing blootgestel is. &#x2019;n Mens moet hier onderskei tussen vrywillige en gedwonge risiko&#x2019;s, want mense is meer geneigd om vrywillige risiko&#x2019;s te aanvaar as gedwonge risiko&#x2019;s, veral as hulle by die vrywillige uitvoering van &#x2019;n riskante aktiwiteit sekere persoonlike voordele kan kry. Die statistiek wat ek gee is getalle en dit dui die doodsrisiko per 1 miljoen mense per jaar vir sekere aktiwiteite aan. Die eerste waarna ek <span class="col_985-986" refersTo="page_0520"/>verwys, is die doodsrisiko waaraan &#x2019;n mens blootgestel is indien &#x2019;n miljoen mense elke dag een bottel wyn drink, en in daardie geval is die getal 750. Die ry van &#x2019;n motorfiets is &#x2019;n baie gevaarliker aktiwiteit en in daardie geval is die getal 2 000. Die risiko-faktor verbonde aan die bestuur van &#x2019;n motor is in hierdie terme 170. Vir bergklim, is die risikofaktor 40. Die risikofaktor om deur &#x2019;n motor doodgery te word is 50. Die risikofaktor om te sterf as gevolg van &#x2019;n vallende vliegtuig is 0,1, wat op &#x2019;n baie lae risiko dui. Die risikofaktor ten opsigte van weerlig is 0,1 en die risikofaktor dat &#x2019;n mens beseer sal word in die bedryf van &#x2019;n kemkragstasie is 0,1. Die risikofaktor dat &#x2019;n mens sal sterf as gevolg van &#x2019;n ongeluk wat plaasvind by &#x2019;n kernkragstasie is 0,01.</p>

<p>Uit sulke ontledings wat volgens interna-sionaalaanvaarbare metodes gedoen word, sien &#x2019;n mens verder dat dit baie gevaarliker is om elke dag twee kilometer per motor na jou werk te ry en weer terug as wat dit is om twee kilometer van &#x2019;n kemkragstasie te woon. [Tyd verstreke.]</p>

<from>Die <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER VAN WATERWESE, BOSBOUEN OMGEWINGSBEWARING</person>:</from>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, baie dankie vir die geleentheid en in die kort tyd tot my be-skikking sal ek probeer handel met agb. lede wat sekere sake hier geopper het. Eerstens, wil dit vir my voorkom asof die agb. lid vir Ermelo en die agb. lid vir Barberton met hul buurkiesafdelings saamgespan het om een saak hier te opper en ek wil dus met hierdie twee agb. lede gelyktydig praat. In die eerste plek het dit gegaan oor bebossingsuitbrei-dings en die vraag hoeveel bosse aangeplant moet word. Van tyd tot tyd word na syfers verwys en mense beweer dat sulke bebossing teen die tempo van 25 000 hektaar per jaar, of selfs 30 000 hektaar per jaar moet geskied. Ander het ges&#x00EA; dat ons agter raak, terwyl ander weer beweer dat daar &#x2019;n oorskot is. Ek wil daarby volstaan deur te s&#x00EA; dat die Bosbouraad &#x2019;n deskundige komitee aan-gestel het om van meet af op hierdie hele aangeleentheid in te gaan. Hulle het reeds &#x2019;n verslag teruggekry en die raad vergader op 6 Oktober en ek meen dat ons in daardie stadium weer heeltemal nuwe syfers sal kry om ons in staat te stel om te besluit wat om te doen. Daar is ook verwys na bebossings-lenings. Ek dink nie dat dit &#x2019;n kwessie van &#x2019;n gebrek aan propaganda was wat daartoe gelei het dat hierdie mense nie geweet het van die bebossingslenings nie, maar eerder omdat hulle bekommerd was oor die afset van hout. Noudat die afset van hout op &#x2019;n vaster grondslag geplaas is, ook as gevolg van die twee groot pulpfabrieke wat opgerig word, meen ek dat daar groter aanplanting sal wees. Agb. lede het ook kommer uitge-spreek oor die samestelling van die Bosbouraad. Ek wil daarop wys dat die Bosbouraad op die oomblik weer in die proses is om her-saamgestel te word en moontlik kan ons nou kyk of ons nie meer bevrediging kan gee as vantevore nie. Sover dit die uitreiking van permitte vir bebossing betref, wil ek daarop wys dat 1 600 sulke permitte die afgelope 10 jaar uitgereik is vir &#x2019;n totaal van 314 000 hektaar wat bebos is. Ongeveer 100 permitte is geweier waarby 30 000 hektaar betrokke was. Agb. lede sal dus sien dat die aantal permitte wat geweier is, nie besonder groot is nie. Gebiede word geklassifiseer volgens die afloop van water uit daardie gebiede na die riviere en die sensitiwiteit van hierdie gebiede word dus geklassifiseer in kategorie&#x00EB; 1, 2 of 3. In kategorie 1 word geen bebossing toegelaat nie. In kategorie 2 word bebossing toegelaat tot die peil van 5&#x0025; van die gebruik van die water wat jaarliks afloop. In kategorie 3 word bebossing toegelaat tot 10&#x0025; van die hoeveelheid water wat jaarliks uit daardie gebied afloop. Dit is die maatstawwe wat aangewend word en, soos ek ges&#x00EA; het, word baie permitte uitgereik en ek meen nie dat dit &#x2019;n besondere probleemis nie.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town was worried about the fact that the Forestry Directorate is his neighbour. The Act places no compulsion on any owner to prepare a fire-break of any predetermined width. The Act is specific in regard to the manner of clearing of the belt and that the labour to be supplied by each party is subject to mutual agreement, failing which the magistrate shall decide. It is therefore for the farmer concerned to consult with the forester on the width of the fire-break. One must bear in mind that in many parts of the country private farmers also practise forestry and they welcome the present provisions. The Forest Act is, however, being revised at present and the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions will be taken into consideration. I am afraid <span class="col_987-988" refersTo="page_0521"/>that some of his fellow farmers in forestry may not be too happy with the hon. member&#x2019;s suggestions. However, I think it is very necessary that neighbours, be they private farmers, foresters or the Directorate of Forestry, should live in peace with one another. As regards the hon. members remarks concerning Table 5.6.3 in the Annual Report, I can tell him that regrettably the relevant figure of the cost per hectare is incorrect and should be 0,23.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Vryheid het onder meer gepraat oor die heffing wat die Bosbouraad opl&#x00EA;. Op rondehout is die heffing 15c per kubieke meter. Dit word betaal deur beide die produsent en die verbruiker, wat in hier-die geval die houtverwerkers is. As die Staat hier &#x2019;n bydrae moet maak, sal ons ook geld daaruit moet ontvang vir die navorsing waarmee ons besig is, want &#x2019;n besondere groot gedeelte van hierdie fondse van die Bosbouraad word aan navorsing bestee. Ek glo nie dit sal die kwekers betaal as dit op daardie manier gedoen word nie. Ek dink dat die huidige manier van heffing baie bevredigend is.</p>

<p>&#x2019;n Loofhoutnavorsingsprojek word tans deur die Nasionale Instituut vir Houtnavor-sing van die WNNR ten behoewe van die Bosbouraad onderneem. Die doel van hierdie projek wat deur die raad gefinansier word, is om gebruiksaanwendings vir lae-graadse Eucalyptus-hout te vind. Daar kan moontlik daarin geslaag word om sodoende die ingevoerde loofhout met plaaslik gekweekte Eucalyptus-spesies te vervang.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook verwys na die vervaardiging van gelamineerde dwarsl&#x00EA;ers. Net gister kon &#x2019;n mens in die koerant lees dat die Spoorwee &#x2019;n kontrak van R21 miljoen vir hierdie dwarsl&#x00EA;ers aangegaan het.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Nelspruit het gepraat oor die museum op Sabie. Ek wil met hom saamstem. Ek kan dit met die grootste vry-moedigheid aanbeveel. Dit is iets besonders dat iemand in Sabie aftree en dan hierdie stokperdjie van hom uitbou tot iets absoluut besienswaardig in daardie deel van die land. Dit lewer werklik waar &#x2019;n unieke bydrae tot Sabie en sy omgewing. Ek dink &#x2019;n mens moet dr. Winkler gelukwens met wat hy daar bereik het.</p>

<p>Wat die motortydrenne betref, wil ek s&#x00EA; dat dit iets is wat &#x2019;n groot omvang aangeneem het. Dit is nie meer so iets soos &#x2019;n outydse kermis van &#x2019;n plaaslike skool nie. Dit word nou op groot skaal georganiseer. Ek moet die agb. lid gelyk gee. Ek besef ook die voordeel daarvan vir Suid-Afrika. Moontlik moet ons almal maar &#x2019;n klein bie-tjie opofferinge doen. Ek is bereid om met inagneming van sy verto&#x00EB; weer te kyk of dit vir ons moontlik is om ten opsigte van hierdie aangeleentheid te help.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany in the first instance spoke about the zebra. The question was whether a number of animals were given to a hunting farm. The answer that this was not done still stands. The zebra were presented to the Ciskeian authorities with a view to starting a game reserve in the interests of nature conservation. This is the information we received from the National Parks Board. The hon. member will realize that the National Parks Board is an autonomous body.</p>

<p>As regards cycads, they are protected plants in accordance with provincial ordinances in all four provinces. I must tell the hon. member that I am a little worried about these protected plants. When these plants are removed from their habitat, they find their way to the gardens of collectors and one will always find collectors boasting about the number of such plants and also other relevant plants in their garden. In doing so, they forget that when they collect these plants, very often somebody else is being robbed. I wonder whether the time has not come for us to start thinking about licensing collectors.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said, I cannot do it. The National Parks Board is an autonomous body. I will, however, approach <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_0522"/>the National Parks Board again about this.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simon&#x2019;s Town complained about the pollution of False Bay. The hon. member was very serious in making his complaint and I want to say to him that if his complaints are correct and can be substantiated it will be even more serious. I for one am not saying that they cannot be substantiated and I promise the hon. member that I will instruct the department to check on these complaints.</p>

<p>As regards Doringbaai I agree with him. I also agree that as regards the land mass destruction, pollution or call it what you will, that cannot be allowed. I shall ask my department to look into this in conjunction with other bodies.</p>

<speech by="#minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland referred to the possibility of a Directorate of the Environment. Let me put it this way: I think we must start from the bottom. There is only one thing I have seen starting from the top and that is the digging of graves. I do not think that that is the way to approach matters. As this branch of the department develops, I think the time might come when it can become a directorate, but not at this stage. For the moment I think we should leave it as it is and allow it to grow, with which I am sure the hon. member will help.</p>

<p>Regarding the necessity of bringing environmental conservation and physical planning under one umbrella, our philosophy is that environmental considerations should be second nature with any person or body concerned with planning or development. It involves a massive education task, but it is necessary and we must succeed with it.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid het ook &#x2019;n organisasie van omgewingsbewaring vir Suidelike Afrika bepleit. Indien dit moontlik is, is ons graag daarvoor te vinde.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid dr. Odendaal het &#x2019;n groot deel van sy toespraak aan die agb. lid vir Bryanston gewy. Ek dink die agb. lid vir Bryanston sal naderhand besluit het dat &#x2019;n mens liewer nie moet praat oor goed waarvan jy in die koerant gelees het en verder niks weet nie. Wat die impak van stedelike ontwikkeling op landbou betref, kan ek maar net s&#x00EA; dat ek die agb. lid se siening deel. Die Afdeling Fisiese Beplanning van die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister is baie beslis hierop bedag en net in die afgelope week het ons almal opdrag gekry dat, voordat verandering van die gebruik van land-bougrond oorweeg word, dit heel eerste met die Kantoor van die Eerste Minister uitgeklaar moet word.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Uitenhage het die skepping van marine-reservate bepleit. Hy het my in &#x2019;n moeilike posisie geplaas. Hy sal besef dat d&#x00ED;t wat hy my vra, &#x2019;n aangeleentheid is wat onder my kollega die agb. Minister van Landbou en Visserye ressorteer. Al wat ek in hierdie stadium vir hom kan s&#x00EA;, is dat ek baie simpatie het met sy standpunt en onderneem om dit verder met my kollega op te neem.</p>

<p>Die agb. lid vir Pretoria-Oos het hier interessante syfers aangehaal en interessante gegewens verstrek oor die moontlikheid dat iemand sy einde kan vind as gevolg van kernkragbesoedeling, ens. Hy het egter die betrokke syfers indien &#x2019;n windpomp op die installasie sou val, weggelaat. Soos hy dit in elk geval self gestel het, is dit hipotetiese besoedeling. Ek dank hom vir die inligting wat hy verstrek het en ek dank hom vir sy bydrae. Ek het geen aanmerkings om te maak op &#x2019;n man wat weet waarvan hy praat nie. Ek dank hom vir sy bydrae en wil vir hom s&#x00EA; dat ek sy meerdere kennis in hierdie opsig erken.</p>

<p>Mnr. die Voorsitter, dit is vir my &#x2019;n voorreg om al die agb. lede wat bygedra het, hartlik te bedank.</p>

<p>I also wish to thank the hon. members opposite for the very positive and, may I say, enjoyable discussion.</p>

<p>Teenoor u, mnr. die Voorsitter, en almal wat deelgeneem het, wil ek my hartlike dank betuig.</p>
