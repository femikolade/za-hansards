                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr T S YENGENI: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes the recent remarks attributed to Mr Peter Marais, the
         Democratic Alliance's mayoral candidate in the Western Cape, by
         his colleague Freda Adams, former New NP MEC, who was so disgusted
         by his behaviour that she resigned from the Democratic Alliance;


   (2)      recognises that these alleged remarks were racist, sexist and
         offensive; and


     3) calls on the party that claims to be the party for all - despite
        the top thirty places on its list for the Cape Town Council not
        including one single African - to discipline Mr Marais and to
        apologise to the women of South Africa.


[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP and the Democratic
Alliance ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Mike Ellis. We have agreed that
you are moving a motion ...

Mr M J ELLIS: I shall move on behalf of the DP:


   That the House -
   (1)      notes -


         (a)     that the ANC Government insists that the high price of
              Aids drugs is the single biggest barrier to giving South
              Africans access to these drugs; and


         (b)     the Government has so far failed to respond to an offer
              made by five pharmaceutical companies and the United Nations
              in May this year to negotiate large discounts on
              antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV infection to unborn babies
              and rape survirors;


     (2)    expresses its appreciation to the DP for arranging to negotiate
         with these companies to buy discounted drugs which will be
         available to Aids-infected patients in Democratic Alliance-
         controlled provinces and local authorities; and


     (3)    calls on the ANC Government to follow the DA's example and do
         everything in its power to give all South Africans access to life-
         saving drugs.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes


         (a)     the commitments made by this Parliament to shun any form
              of discrimination on the basis of race and religion;


         (b)     the inflammatory nature of religious conflicts;


         (c)     the potential for the Middle East conflict to have
              repercussions in South Africa;


         (d)     the example of great leaders such as Nelson Mandela and
              Chris Hani who advocated nonviolence, negotiated solutions and
              mutual compromise as a means towards coexistence


         (e)     the importance of educating children towards nonviolence ;
              and


         (f)     the danger of oversimplifying the Middle East conflict
              into populist rhetoric; and


   (2)      calls on leaders who have close ties with Mr Arafat to encourage
         him to -


         (a)     discourage violence among Palestinian youth;


         (b)     destroy educational material and programmes inciting and
              training youth and children to kill their Jewish neighbours;
              and


         (c)     embrace negotiation, compromise and nonviolence as the
              only solutions to Palestinian self-determination and Israel's
              survival;


   (3)      calls on all who make pronouncements on that to diligently
         research the facts relating to the conflict.

Ms N D NGCENGWANE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes -


         (a)     the continuing military aggression by the Israeli
              government against unarmed Palestinians, which left 150
              Palestinians dead; and


         (b)     the continuing deafening silence of the leader of the DP
              towards the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people
              and the use of excessive force by Israel against the people of
              Palestine;


   (2)      reaffirms its abhorrence of the extent of violence used by the
         Israeli army, which includes the use of tanks in denying the
         Palestinian people their resolve to self-determination;


   (3)      associates itself with the world opinion, as articulated at the
         United Nations, that the situation in Palestine is a threat to
         international peace and security; and
   (4)      declares our unqualified support to the Palestinian people in
         their quest for freedom, self-determination and justice.
[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the New NP:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes that, notwithstanding Deputy President Zuma's efforts to
         convince the House that there has been a reduction in crime -


         (a)     according to the Institute for Security Studies, crime has
              in fact increased by 5% during the first five months of this
              year;


         (b)     violent crime increased by 8% compared to the same period
              last year; and


        (c)      crime is now higher than in any comparable period since
              1994; and
   (2)      urges the Minister of Safety and Security to lift the moratorium
         on crime statistics, because the co-operation of an informed
         public is a prerequisite for fighting crime effectively.

Mr M E MABETA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


   That the House -


   (1)      expresses its concern that, despite a new political dispensation
         based on the true principles of democracy that allows for free
         political activities, political intimidation and assassinations
         continue unabated as demonstrated by the killing of several UDM
         leaders such as Sifiso Nkabinde in KwaZulu-Natal and others in the
         Western Cape;


   (2)      is deeply disturbed by the poor prosecution of the accused in
         the murders of members of the party, namely Mr Milton Mbewana and
         Nomhle Gexu;


   (3)      commends Judge Dennis Davis for his comments when sentencing
         Fikile Mandela, to the effect that those who conspired and
         orchestrated the murders were not brought to book;


   (4)      rejects the remarks of the ANC about Judge Dennis Davis in this
         respect;


   (5)      is further displeased by the fact that two weeks after the
         murder of Victor Mbulelo Sam, chairperson of the UDM branch in
         Crossroads, no arrests have been made ....

[Time expired.]

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes


         (a)     with grave concern the pressure put by the media and the
              DP on the Presidency to disclose the nature of Mr Parks
              Mankahlana's long illness and the cause of his death; and


         (b)     that the ANC encourages people to publicly disclose their
              HIV/Aids status and expresses its desire to destigmatise
              HIV/Aids;


   (2)      believes that -


         (a)     the disclosure of the nature of Comrade Parks Mankahlana's
              illness is a prerogative of his immediate family; and


         (b)     people have a right to privacy which must be upheld and
              respected; and


   (3)      calls on the media and the DP to desist from this irresponsible
         conduct and respect the wishes of the Mankahlana family.

[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes -


         (a)     with concern that the Greater Nelspruit Rape Intervention
              Project was evicted from two Mpumalanga hospitals for helping
              rape survivors get anti-Aids drugs, and that about 75% of the
              victims seen by the project are survivors of gang rape and 54%
              are under the age of 16; and


         (b)     that although Grip has reached a settlement with state
              attorneys to return to the hospitals, they have had to agree
              to not provide rape survivors with the funding for AZT and 3TC
              at state hospitals or ask doctors working there to write out
              prescriptions;


   (2)      is appalled that the Government has also demanded that they stop
         raising funds for the drugs and that they stop advising the public
         that they can take medication to reduce the risk of Aids; and


   (3)      calls on the Government to -


         (a)     stop preventing disadvantaged people from accessing what
              others can buy; and


         (b)     explain their motive in actively preventing rape victims,
              mothers and babies from accessing available drugs which reduce
              their chance of contracting HIV/Aids.

Mr M A MANGENA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of Azapo:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes -


         (a)     the ever-escalating price of crude oil and, therefore, of
              all petroleum products;


         (b)     that the steepest rise is in the price of paraffin, which
              is used by the poorest in our society for lighting and
              cooking; and


         (c)     the fact that the Government has previously been asked to
              consider subsidising the price of paraffin in order to cushion
              the poor against these abnormal escalations;


   (2)      observes that the Ministry of Minerals and Energy has announced
         its intention to investigate ways of intervening in respect of the
         price of paraffin; and


   (3)      therefore acknowledges the noble intentions on the part of the
         Ministry of Minerals and Energy and wishes them well in their
         endeavours.

Ms S K MNUMZANA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes -
         (a)     the meeting organised by the leader of the DP, Mr Tony
              Leon, with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate for cheaper
              drugs for treatment of opportunistic diseases for people
              living with HIV/Aids; and


         (b)     that the DP, backed by major pharmaceutical companies,
              opposed the then Medicines and Related Substances Control
              Amendment Bill which would make it easier for our people to
              access cheaper drugs;


   (2)      believes that Mr Tony Leon is trying to hijack initiatives by
         the ANC-led Government to make cheaper drugs accessible to our
         people and is scoring political points at the expense of the
         people suffering from HIV/Aids; and


   (3)      calls on Mr Tony Leon and the DP to be part of the Government's
         partnership against Aids and to participate in the HIV/Aids
         awareness campaign.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr A J BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes that -


         (a)     farmers, as a group, have become the biggest victims of
              murder in South Africa, according to figures released by Agri-
              SA;


         (b)     on average, 274 farmers per 100 000 of the population are
              murdered each year, exceeding murders of members of the Police
              Service; and


         (c)     between January and September this year, about 600 farm
              attacks have occurred, resulting in the deaths of 100 people;


   (2)      acknowledges that without viable commercial farming, South
         Africa will become dependent on imported food, making food much
         more expensive for everyone; and


   (3)      calls on the Government to take greater steps to protect people
         living in rural areas and to refrain from making any statements
         which encourage attacks on farmers and farmworkers.

Prince N E ZULU: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


   That the House -


   (1)      condemns, on behalf of peace-loving citizens, the killing of an
         IFP candidate for the local government elections in Gauteng;


   (2)      is of the opinion that the police should be given high-tech
         apparatus to find the killers of Comrade Justice Radebe with a
         focus on wiping out crime in our country;


   (3)      notes that the Independent Electoral Commission takes a serious
         view of whether such a killing augurs well for a free and fair
         election in that province; and
   (4)      calls on the perpetrators of crime to save the coming local
         elections and save South Africa from being a scapegoat for
         international criminal demagogy.

Mr L M KGWELE: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes that the Department of Education reports that nearly 300
         South African high schools from all socioeconomic backgrounds have
         made great strides in improving their matric pass rate over the
         past three years;


   (2)      congratulates the ANC Minister of Education and the Department
         of Education on the excellent guidance that they provide to the
         provincial education authorities to implement the necessary
         intervention to reach the goal of providing quality education to
         all our people; and


   (3)      wishes all matriculation candidates the very best while they
         write their final examination.
[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


   That the House -


   (1)      notes that -


         (a)     poverty in South Africa is a direct result of rampant
              unemployment;


         (b)     the ANC promises in its poster campaign to address poverty
              in South Africa;


         (c)     the ANC has failed in its 1994 election promise of "Jobs
              for all"; and [Interjections.]


         (d)     the ANC's campaign of "Speeding up change" is only
              speeding up change for a select few that are cronies of the
              ANC leadership;
   (2)      urges the ANC Government to recognise that its promise to
         address poverty cannot be realised without first addressing the
         high levels of crime, creating an investor-friendly climate and
         restructuring its rigid labour laws; and


   (3)      calls on the ANC to take note that all South Africans will react
         to the clarion call of the Democratic Alliance which is prepared
         to put all the people of South Africa first.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The first item on the Order Paper is
a statement by the hon the Minister of Finance on the Medium-Term Budget
Policy Statement. By agreement, the decision on the Minister's statement
will follow later.

                  MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT 2000

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, today we lay before this
House the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement 2000. This statement is in
many respect a symbol of our maturing democracy and we are deeply
appreciative of the time that Parliament will devote to debating it
intensively this year.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement serves three functions. Firstly, it
advises Parliament on what has changed in the economic outlook since the
Budget was tabled in February this year. Secondly, it shares with the House
the developments in public policy that will shape the Budget to be tabled
on 21 February next year. Thirdly, and most importantly, it invites
Parliament and the nations to reflect on our priorities, performance and
plans and to share with us in addressing the challenges we face in shaping
the future of our country.

What then has changed in the economy? Firstly, I will address international
developments. The past three years have been difficult for the global
economy, and although the volatility that characterised the 1998 financial
crisis has abated, there are still many challenges. Global growth, which
may reach 4% this year, has contributed to our healthy export performance.
However, rising oil prices, declining commodity prices - with the notable
exception of platinum perceptions of instability in the region and a
general decline in capital flows to emerging markets have continued to
constrain growth in South Africa

Amongst the most important risks to the global economy in the coming
months, are the large economic and financial imbalances between the three
major currency areas, that is the US dollar, the euro and the yen. Global
growth has largely been sustained by the continued expansion of the US
economy. However, the current account deficit of the US balance of payments
is now uncomfortably large. Moreover, further corrections in asset prices
and uncertainty about the future of US interest rates remain a source of
volatility in the mature economies, with important knok-on effects for
emerging and developing countries.

It is also worth noting that several fast-growing economies have large
current account deficits, and many of the countries that were affected by
the 1998 financial crises, especially those in Asia, are now facing large
fiscal deficits. The recent increases in oil prices, if sustained, will
hamper global growth with oil-importing countries, particularly the
poorest, being the most affected.

Let me turn briefly to the impact of global trends on monetary and balance
of payments trends in our own economy. Monetary policy has entered a new
era. The Monetary Policy Committee and broader consultation forums have
brought greater transparency to the policy process and we have agreed, as
Parliament, on the inflation target.

Although the recent increases in oil prices and the impact of floods and
food prices have increased the trends in prices this year, underlying
demand and cost pressures in the economy remain muted. We are confident
that the target for consumer price inflation, excluding mortgage costs of
between 3% and 6% in 2002, will be met.

Interest rates, this year, have remained relatively stable and prospects
for a further easing of interest rates as inflation declines remain good.
The balance of payments performance this year reflects the underlying
strength in the economy. Exports have responded positively to international
opportunities and the depreciation of the rand. Exports increased by nearly
9% this year in volume, and we expect a further 7% growth a year between
2001 and 2003. The gold price has been a disappointment, but we have
benefited from the extraordinary surge in the price of platinum group
metals. Imports have grown moderately and despite the rise in the price of
oil, we expect that the current account deficit will be a modest 0,4% of
GDP for the year.

As growth gathers momentum, we anticipate that the current account deficit
will rise, averaging about 1,3% a year for the next three years. In 1999,
South Africa received a total of $4,1 billion in capital inflows. This was
$1 billion more than in 1998. However, this trend has been reversed in the
first half of this year with the capital account recording a nett outflow
of R1 billion, which is mainly a consequence of sales of bonds by
nonresidents. We should remember that most developing countries are subject
to the unpredictability of these portfolio flows which happen, these days,
at the speed of an electronic impulse.

The overarching objective is to ensure sustainable development here in
South Africa so that we can create employment opportunities for our people
and fiercely combat the poverty that still stamps its mark of shame on our
nation. Creating the conditions for human and economic development is not
an easy process. It requires time, patience and, often, it requires
difficult decisions and consolidation.

Over the past five years, we have decisively addressed several structural
barriers to growth, protectionist trade policies, exchange controls, an
unsustainable fiscal position and the inequitable distribution of public
services. We have strengthened revenue performance, restrained Government
consumption expenditure and reduced the budget deficit. We can now build on
these achievements.

Today we announce a bold programme of targeted public expenditure that is
focused on developing our people and building infrastructure.

The economy has been subject to a number of shocks in the first part of
this year including floods, high oil prices, a depressed gold price and
perceptions of regional instability. These have adversely affected economic
growth. Our revised estimate of growth for the fiscal year is 2,6%.

Our sound foundations, improvements in our already strong export
performance and accelerating investment spending will underpin an annual
growth rate of around 3,5% over the period of the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework.

The restructuring of Transnet, Telkom, Eskom and Denel, amongst others,
will benefit all South Africans over the next three years, thus bringing in
foreign investment and contributing to lower prices and better
infrastructure services. It will also lead to an injection of private
sector capital, technology and expertise into our economy.

Similar cost and efficiency gains should derive from the public-private
partnerships that aim to bring the disciplines of private sector risk
management and the long-term contractual commitments to various areas of
public service delivery.

The restructuring of state-owned assets is but one of a number of deep
structural changes that have taken place in the economy. Much of our future
success will depend on the regulatory changes and support structures that
will facilitate and free up economic activity.

I talked about the platform for growth that this Government has
established. Because we have not spent beyond our means, because we have
improved the way we collect and spend revenue, and aided by our
privatisation receipts, we have brought the budget deficit under control.
This year, it is projected at 2,6% and it will fall to 2,1% of GDP in 2003-
04.

By reducing the deficit, we have reduced a share of revenue we spend on
servicing debt, thus freeing up resources for public expenditure. For the
first time in over 20 years, debt service costs as a percentage of GDP are
declining. Debt service costs are projected to fall from 5,5% of GDP last
year to 4,5% in 2003-04, a downward revision and an improvement of the
Budget estimates of February this year.

Government dissaving has fallen from 5,9% of GDP in 1994 to 2,6% last year.
As Government increasingly shifts spending towards capital expenditure,
Government dissaving is projected to decline to zero by the year 2002.

Lower debt and real interest rates are now helping to insulate the economy
from external shocks. By reducing interest rates and containing inflation,
we make it easier for businesses and firms to invest in the economy and
create jobs.

This strong fiscal position, our enhanced capacity to collect revenue and
the revised projections for economic growth contribute to upward
adjustments to our revenue estimates for the MTEF period.

The preliminary outcome for revenue collected last year is R198,2 billion.
This year we anticipate collecting R212,2 billion, projected to grow to
R271 billion by 2003-04.

By broadening the revenue base and improving tax collection, we have been
able to lower tax rates, which will lower the costs of investment and job
creation, and release household spending power. The 2001 budget will again
include substantial income tax relief.

And this brings us to our bottom line: The amount we are able to spend on
goods and services, on developing the infrastructure, in creating jobs, in
protecting our citizens and, most important, in alleviating poverty has
increased.

We can now project an increase in expenditure of R7,8 billion in 2001-02
and R13,2 billion in 2002-03 over the baseline estimates published in the
2000 Budget, and an additional R18,3 billion in the new year of the MTEF
over and above the baseline budgeted for by the departments. Including
provisions for contingencies, expenditure on public services will grow by
3,7% a year in real terms over the next three years.

In embarking on this bold extension of public expenditure, we will target
investment in our people and development of our physical infrastructure.

Capital spending and related infrastructure rehabilitation maintenance is
projected to increase from R24,1 billion in the present fiscal year to R32
billion by the year 2003-04 - R8 billion more and a growth rate of nearly
18% a year. Allocation for rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure
stands at nearly R1 billion this year. There will be further amounts for
flood-damaged provinces over the next two years, contributing not only to
repairs and maintenance, but also to job creation and stimulation of
economic activity in some of our poorest provinces.

Spending on physical infrastructure will also be targeted at our transport
and communications networks, railways rolling stock, our hospitals,
schools, clinics and other public buildings. It will address the problem of
underspending and slower-than-anticipated delivery in a number of areas in
which Government has previously allocated funds.

We also hope that some of this expenditure can be targeted towards building
our capacity in the knowledge economy by ensuring that computers and the
web are more accessible, particularly, to our school children. At the same
time measures will be taken to ensure improvements in the quality of our
infrastructure investment - much of which takes place at the provincial and
local government level - and to address institutional inefficiencies.

Social services continue to account for over half of national and
provincial non-interest spending, or over R106 billion is spent on
education health and welfare services this year. In addition, our social
security funds account for about R8 billion a year in transfers to the
unemployed and victims of road accidents or workplace injuries. South
Africa's social service expenditure has increased strongly in recent years
and has been redirected towards poorer provinces and towards meeting the
needs of the poor first.

Spending on social services will increase by R21 billion over the next
three years or by 6,3% per year in education, 6,7% in health and 7,8% in
welfare services. In addition to these increases, schools and health
services will benefit from the planned increases in infrastructure
spending. Now the challenge becomes one of improving efficiency and
quality.

Bearing in mind that our youth is our future, we have provided for
continued investment into early childhood development initiatives. We
realise that, especially for children from poorer households, early
preschool education can make the difference between success and failure in
the more senior grades. We need an efficient system, a system that delivers
returns. Our best returns are in educated, self-confident young people who
graduate from our schools. We believe that the earlier we start with the
process of education the better.

We also have to square up to the tragedy we are all facing. The effects on
our economy, our lives and on our social fabric with the HIV/Aids epidemic.
We realise that HIV/Aids will present and immense challenge to the social
services sectors in coming years and we have to gear ourselves to face that
challenge. The sharp increase in the provincial equitable share should
better enable provinces to ensure that the health and welfare budgets have
the resources to deal with increasing pressures of HIV and Aids. Government
is also introducing a special allocation to support more integrated Aids
prevention strategies during this fiscal year. This will rise from R75
million this year to R300 in 2003-04.

Co-operative governance is an essential part of our constitutional
democracy. Provinces and local government are at the frontline of the
delivery of social services such as welfare, education, health, poverty
alleviation programmes and in providing the basis of decent living such as
street lights refuse collection, water and electricity.

Over the period of the MEF we will be increasing transfers to provinces by
over 7% a year and to local government by over 15% a year. This should
allow provinces to budget adequately and deal with the pressures that they
will face, particularly in health and education sectors. They will now be
able to budget better for textbooks, teacher training, school building and
medical services. Education will also benefit from the R250 million
allocation, over the next three years, for early childhood development.

Last year we introduced the provincial infrastructure grant. In the year
after next we will increase it by R500 million and by an estimated R1,2
billion and R2,3 billion over the last two years of the MEF. This is an
addition to allocation for flood reconstruction and the building of
Pretoria academic hospital. This represents substantial investments in
developing provincial and local services.

The real challenge, however, will be in how provinces and municipalities
spend these funds. By making public our medium term plans now, we are able
to ensure that programmes can be designed, developed and implemented as the
funds become available. The implementation challenge begins with Cabinet
and the national Government and extends to provincial treasuries
departments and spending agencies, and the new municipalities will have
primary responsibility for basic household services.

In conclusion, we have introduced a wide range of reforms across the budget
process, such as the inter-governmental financial system and the tax
system, thus enhancing our ability to meet the needs of our people. The
success of these reforms is clearly reflected in the reduced share of
revenue that now goes to debt service. It is reflected in the turn-around
of the financial position of provinces from a deficit of R5, 5 billion in
1997/1998 to a R3 billion surplus in 1999/2000. It is reflected in the
increase of 3,7% a year in real spending on public services that we are
able to plan for the next three years.

The challenges facing us are still immense. We laid claim to our democracy
and our country at exactly the time that the winds of globalisation
buffeted developing countries most harshly. But the global climate cannot
distract us from the historic responsibility that rests on our shoulders.
We need rather to grasp the opportunities that globalisation opens to us.
We will continue to pursue an economic strategy and fiscal policies aimed
at overcoming poverty and inequally through sustainable growth and
effective engagement with the global economy.

Our responsibility is to invest in our people by spending on infrastructure
and on education, by facilitating the development of skills so that we can
take part in the increasingly knowledge-oriented economy of the world by
investing in justice and security, and by responding effectively to the
social challenges before us. I would like to thank my colleagues in Cabinet
and, in particular, the Ministers Committee on the Budget for their
support. May I conclude by inviting Parliament and fellow South Africans to
join us in debating priorities and programmes proposed in the 2000 Medium-
Term Budget Policy Statement. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! May I remind hon members that the
NTBPS workshop will take place tomorrow between 9:30 and 12:30 and will be
conducted by both the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Minister of
Finance. The House will be divided into two. The first cluster will be in
the National Assembly and the second cluster in E249 ... [Interjections.] I
am sorry, the Old Assembly Chamber.

Hon members, this is the first of its kind and this is quite an important
workshop. This is to inform members of Parliament how the Budget of the
country is formulated. We therefore request members to participate in this
workshop, ask questions and understand how the entire Budget of this
country works. The workshop will focus on two main issues. The first is the
micro economic focus and, secondly, it will also focus on the priority
expenditures of the Government which is very crucial for all of us as
members to understand, to enable us to engage effectively with the Budget
of this country. All members are therefore requested not to ignore that
workshop but to attend the workshop.

                        RATING OF SOUTH AFRICA BY WHO

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, hon members, the World Heath
Organisation released its World Heath Report 2000, which focused on health
systems performance, earlier this year. I then invited the WHO to come to
South Africa to present the findings of the assessment to MECs, heads of
provincial departments of health, the private sector and other stakeholders
whom I had also invited to the meeting. A WHO representative, Dr
Christopher Marais, formally presented the findings. This meeting was
preceded by technical discussions between the WHO and our departmental
staff, where the focus of the discussions was the technical aspects of the
evaluation methodology to allow us better insight into how the rating was
arrived at and to understand better what is considered important by the WHO
in the delivery of health care.

The performance of health systems has traditionally been evaluated through
measures such as the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate.

However, these are disease-outcome measures that do not adequately assess
the performance of the systems that deliver health services. The World
Health Organisation has, therefore, developed a new framework and
appropriate measuring tools to assess the efficiency of health systems in
achieving health outcomes. Using the newly developed measure of health
systems' performance, the WHO has assessed the performance of its 191
member states.

The new health systems performance tool is based on a number of key
components which give a composite assessment of equity, efficiency and
quality in a health system. The assessment is based on five main
indicators, which are: improving the health status of the South African
population; reducing inequalities in health status; ensuring that the
health system is responsive to realistic expectations that the public have
of it; reducing the inequalities in responsiveness of the health system
across different groups in the population, and achieving fairness in
amounts that people spend on health.

On the basis of this assessment, overall, South Africa rated 175 out of 191
countries. It was quite clear, even as admitted by the WHO, that there were
defects in the assessment, as this was the first time that it was being
done in this way.

In the case of South Africa, for instance, because of the gaps in our data,
in many instances, proxies were used. This clearly introduced significant
inaccuracies. However, the WHO has pledged to improve the quality of the
tools used in the methodology for assessment.

Another important point is that there was no consultation with the
countries being assessed, and because of that, the WHO lost out on some
important information which could have enhanced the quality of the
evaluation.

The major contributors to South Africa's low ranking were found to be the
following: the apartheid backlog; inefficiencies in health resource
distribution between the private and public health sector and projections
on the impact of HIV/Aids.

The inefficiencies in expenditure between the public and private health
sector is a result of our reality in South Africa, and of course, the
legacy of apartheid, where the private health sector spends close to 80% of
the nation's health resources on only 20% of the total population of South
Africa. There are serious inequalities in the way in which these resources
are distributed between the public and private health sectors.

The current backlogs were also caused by apartheid planning, which
neglected the planning of providing of adequate health care services for
the majority of South Africans.

A striking feature of the report is its emphasis on the issues which
Government has been addressing through various policy initiatives. We have
addressed the importance of universal coverage through our policy of free
health care at primary health facilities, and by embracing social
solidarity by pooling resources for social security in health care. The WHO
makes a point of risk pooling in social health insurance to guarantee that
even the poorest segments of the population are within the health safety
net. Our new Medical Schemes Act of 1998 addresses this and the
inequalities in the access to health as well as grossly inequitable
expenditures on health care by individuals.
It is particularly important for us that this report is being released now,
when we face such strong opposition to our policies which even major
international organisations such as the WHO confirmed are the right
direction to take. Government has demonstrated its commitment to these
policies, and as an example, a task team has been established by Cabinet to
look at comprehensive social security, a component of which is risk
pooling, much emphasised by the WHO report.

Another area of the health system that was pointed out by the report was
the failure by governments to take up their stewardship role adequately.

It is a function of government to oversee, lead and provide guidance for
the overall health system through appropriate policy, regulation and
collation of relevant information. It is critical that an environment
exists and government is given the space to perform this function.

This is something that we are happy has been raised, since there are those
amongst us who tend to regard every intervention by Government to be an
infringement on the rights of those who decide to trade in the health
arena. Clearly, Government has an important role to play in ensuring that
resources are used effectively across the private/public devide, and that
policies are pursued that promote the overall coverage of many.

Given the above scenario, our major challenge is going to be the
achievement of a smooth interface between the public and the private
sector. This we have already included in our ten-point plan, a strategic
framework of the department's direction in this current term of government.

Though the overall rating of the country was poor, there were areas where
the health system performed very well. Of note is the fact that the system
was found to be quite responsive to the needs of the people - a factor that
indicates a major success in the implementation of the Batho Pele
principles and the Patients' Rights Charter. The Health Minmec takes note
of this report and sees it in a positive light as yet another piece of work
that helps to strengthen our hand in pursuing the direction we have taken.
In this regard we wish it to be noted that we believe that the new
methodology proposed by the World Health Organisation for assessment of
health systems offers hope for a better and more comprehensive assessment
of health systems. Consequently we have decided to be one of the 20
countries in which the instrument will be further tested.

I would like to take this opportunity to inform this House that we will be
convening a health summit early next year to review progress in the
implementation of our health policies. This summit will provide a suitable
platform for this WHO report to be debated by all stakeholders. This will
ensure that we benchmark our progress against that of other countries,
particularly on the design, process performance and responsiveness of our
health system, in addition to the already used outcome measures such as
infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate.

A lot of ground has been covered since 1994. We have not only ensured
universal access to primary health care services, but this Government has
also achieved strides in improving access to water and sanitation,
education, and others, because these are all key determinants of health,
and their combined impact on improving the health status cannot be ignored.
Therefore, we maintain that our national health system has improved the
lives of our people, especially if one considers the overall effect of
improvements in health, as well as the combined effects of other sectoral
inputs.

Our own evaluation has pointed to the importance and urgency of
streamlining our public/private interface, both to maximize on the total
country's resources, as well as to perform more effectively our function as
Government, to be responsible for the strategy and direction of health care
delivery. The World Health Organisation's recommendations accord with our
own policy interventions, not only in the area of risk pooling as a
mechanism for optimal health coverage, but in other areas as well.

In conclusion, I must emphasise that the WHO report confirms that we are on
the right track with regard to our health sector reforms. We will focus,
firstly, on building solidarity so that people are not discriminated from
accessing health care services because of their economic status in
particular; secondly, bridging the gap between the public and private
sector, especially in the distribution of health care resources, and
thirdly, strengthening the stewardship role of government.

I wish to thank all the public and private health care workers for
committing themselves - everyday of their lives - to providing better
health services, amid many challenges, in order to provide a better life
for all our people.

I am challenging all the political parties in this House to work together
with us to realise this better life for all our people and to stop
pretending that there are quick-fix solutions to the problems of providing
affordable health care, especially in the fight against HIV/Aids.
[Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairperson, the hon the Minister has used a lot of words
this afternoon to hide a pretty dismal record of the state of our health
care services. She has tried to use a number of old excuses for the fact
that she and her department are failing to come to grips with the health
care needs of South Africans.

Six and a half years of ANC Government has done nothing to improve the
health care needs of South Africans. In fact, the situation has
deteriorated. [Interjections.] The hon Minister has been given lots of time
to get her act together. She blames opposition parties and she blames
previous government, but she takes no blame upon her own shoulders. This is
why we will never ever get the health care services right in this country,
because the Minister refuses to admit that her Government and party and
their policies are wrong, and will simply do nothing to improve health care
services in this country. [Interjections.]

The Minister talks about more summits but let me say to her that more
summits will not help. Hard work and clear policies will start to make a
difference to the lives of South Africans. And we have to accept that,
despite the Minister's words this afternoon, South Africa's ranking in the
World Health Organisation Report 2000 shows, once again, just how badly off
South Africans are in comparison with other people living in other
countries in this world.

We have a pretty poor health environment and, at the same time, we
certainly do have access to affordable, high quality health care. The WHO
report is based on the assumption that the differences in the performance
of health systems across the world are not just about money. Some countries
perform well with very little money. Some do badly with a relatively large
amount of money.

Unfortunately, South Africa fits very clearly into the categories of those
that perform badly, despite being relatively well funded. In terms of
health care expenditure per capita, South Africa fits into the top third of
the 191 countries which were measured. But we are very close to the bottom
- No. 175 - in the measurement of how this money is used. And we are also
close to the bottom - No 151 - in terms of how fairly health care benefits
are distributed amongst the population. [Interjections.]

The hon the Minister will start to blame the private sector, the DP, the
New NP and the DA. I know that she will do that, but she will know as well
as I do, that that is only part of the story. There are very serious
problems with her Government's own policies with regard to the distribution
of health care in South Africa, and that is where the rot really starts.

But we hardly need reports from the WHO to tell us how poorly our health
care system has been managed. The evidence is all around us. Over 4 million
South Africans are infected with HIV/Aids and hospitals cannot cope with
the flood of people needing care, but the Government is still trying to
pretend that there is no national crisis. Here they go again! Why do they
not listen for a change, because it would really help them.
[Interjections.]

The Government is still trying to pretend that there is no national crisis
and refusing to devise and implement alternative care options. Drugs are
available to prevent the transmission of HIV/Aids to unborn children and
rape survivors, but the Government is letting politics stand in the way and
will not allow them to be used.

The Leader of the Opposition went to Europe last week, and his trip has
revealed exactly what the position is with regard to HIV/Aids drugs.
[Interjections.] Price reduction offers have been made to our national
Government - and the ANC can say what they like, but they know it is true.
It is clear to this House and to the country at large that this House has
been misled in terms of what offers have been placed on the table and
rejected by the Government, which has then had the audicity to turn round,
as the hon Abe Nkomo has done recently, and said that no offer has been
made. We know that an offer to provide the ARV combination - Combivir - for
two US dollars per day has been in the public domain for the past six
months, and that there have been other good offers relating to Nevirapine.

What the political agenda of the Government is in rejecting these offers is
not clear. It makes no sense. [Interjections.] That hon member should come
and make a better speech if he thinks he can do so. He knows darned well
that he cannot, because he does not even know what he is talking about.
What the political agenda of the Government is in rejecting these offers is
not clear. But the fact that it is having a disastrous result is obvious
and will probably lead to us falling even further down the WHO rating as
our system becomes overburdened with HIV/Aids victims.

At the same time, in KwaZulu-Natal 31 people have died over the past few
months from a cholera outbreak ...

There have been more than 4 000 cases reported so far.

An HON MEMBER: Blame the ANC for that.

Mr M J ELLIS: I do. The hon member is quite right. He should not worry. I
do blame the ANC for that. There is no sign that the governments, either
provincial or national, have been able to contain it, and the ANC is in
charge. [Interjections.] If the community concerned had had access to clean
water, there is no doubt that this outbreak would never have happened.

We all know that clean water is the basis on which any health care system
is built, a fact that this Government would appear to have missed.
[Interjections.] In addition to this, if the community had had access to
good clinics, with sufficient staff and the right medicines, the deaths
could have, and should have, been avoided. In a country like South Africa,
so rich in technology, it is inconceivable that we have a cholera outbreak
of this magnitude.

However, it is not just in the poor rural areas that this happens. We have
in an area less than one kilometre from the new stock exchange in Sandton,
an area known as Mushroom Farm, sewerage bubbling up out of the ground, out
of the water. [Interjections.] No doubt this will be the next area where we
will have cholera outbreaks in South Africa. [Interjections.] If these are
the circumstances prevailing in one of the most well-developed areas of the
most well-developed province, what hope is there for the rest of the
country? [Interjections.]

Let me say in my final few seconds that our health care service in this
country are deteriorating fast. The Minister of Health can say what she
likes. The trouble is whatever she tries to do seems to be a total and
utter disaster. There is no doubt - I sincerely trust that the people of
South Africa will do something about it in this election - that the people
of South Africa will start to show their faith in a new party known as the
Democratic Alliance. [Time expired.] [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Hon Chairman, we have to admit that we inherited an
abysmal health service, and we also have to admit that the Department of
Health and its teams must get 11 out of 10 for effort and for their will to
bring equal care to all. There are pockets of exellence for which people
show gratitude, but nurses are leaving the country in droves, there are
short hours during which clinics can serve the people and long queues, and
people often arrive and get a Panado and a pat on the back.

Let us admit that we have a problem. It may not be getting worse, but it
certainly is not getting better, and it may be just the same. Why is it? It
is because we have a policy that is trying to control all the health
services in the country and build a national health service in which
Government assumes the wisdom to be able to tell who should do what where.
The result is a huge beaurocracy which has no incentive for efficiency and
which is absorbing money like a sponge.

What should we do? We should obligate the state to care for rural people
and for those in informal settlements; to fund emergency care, up to a
limit, in all hospitals, whether they be public or private; to lay down
minimum standards for public and private hospitals; and to establish health
ombudspersons and independent monitoring bodies to ensure that they adhere
to those minimum standards.

If our aim is to bridge the gap between public and private services, we
will only do that if we put them into a competitive relationship.
Government hospitals should offer better accomodation to fee-paying
patients, and private hospitals should be contracted on a competitive basis
to offer treatment to state-funded patients. The state, as the largest
shareholder, will get good prices and will bring the costs of services
down. This will mean improved efficiency, better services and lower costs.

All our health Acts are aimed at control and equality, rather than at
better care, at laying down norms and standards which we cannot police, and
at shifting people and money into the public sector. [Interjections.] We do
not need the World Health Organisation. We see the results. For example,
the cost of medical schemes is spiralling, and fewer people can join them,
which is the opposite of the intention that the Government had when the
legislation was passed. The burden that our legislation is placing on the
schemes is making them more expensive and exclusive.

It is time to change our policies, and to help our enthusiastic Government
and health teams so that we can increase the morale of our nurses and
doctors in all our public hospitals.

Mr S NAIDOO: Chairman, hon members, the World Health Organisation, which
leads the world alliance for health for all, was founded 52 years ago.

The World Health Organisation considers the status of health control of all
countries and issues directives and precautionary measures for the global
upkeep of health standards in countries and regions. It disseminates
pertinent and relevant information in order to reinforce and underpin major
health complaints to needful countries, especially the underdeveloped.

The World Health Organisation, in providing logistical and material
assistance, also provides statistical information by allowing access to
their data bank. The provision of professional personnel is a most welcome
role.

At present, we have 77 deaths caused by cholera, and the perpetual threats
and animal diseases do not portray a strong infrastructure. We should
review our health structures to ensure that our basic fundamental
requisites are maintained, at least to ensure our standards are elevated to
an acceptable international level.

We need to spend more money in this arena and on more substantial
structures to be established in the primary and secondary health sectors.
We need to be alert, at all times, and give priority to the protection of
our people.

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, the Minister says that Government policy is not
discriminating against accessing health care services. [Interjections.]
An organisation committed to serving the disadvantaged in Mpumalanga,
helping them to acquire crisis counselling after rape and getting
medication that reduces the risk of HIV/Aids, is chased from the hospitals
in that province and accused of undermining the health policy of this
Government, enticed back only to avoid the Constitutional Court, because
they would be depriving indigent people of their rights. However, they
still are, because these same people are still being bullied into not
supplying these drugs. They are not even allowed to tell the people that
such drugs are available.

A number of 175 out of 191 does not sound positive to me. We all know that
the problem of Aids, TB, cholera, malaria, etc, is increasing daily.
Defending the integrity of our frontiers, ensuring clean water that is not
contaminated ... [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the dismal rating by the World Health
Organisation, although not expected, should really be a wake-up call to the
whole country.

Of course we know that we have inherited a legacy from the past. We also
know that we have poverty and that water is a problem in this country. I
want to emphasise that until we can get the question of water right, we can
never be a healthy nation.

Of course we know that we need a firm administration of our health
services. Of course we know about the Aids debacle, but I think that what
is important is that, as a nation, this wake-up call says ``let us stand
together''. This is one issue about which we should not be politicising.

Health is a common patrimony for all of us. And what is more, it is a
matter of survival. Unless we get our health services right, nobody is
going to escape. We are all going to swim or sink together.

I therefore welcome the call for a health summit and I hope it will really
be a health summit that can get us on the way to better health services.
[Applause.]

Dr A S NKOMO: Mr Chairperson, I want to thank the Minister of Health
because she has received the report of the World Health Organisation, and
it is yet one of the many reminders that we are now back in the
international community. [Applause.]
Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

Dr A S NKOMO: The World Health Report - for those who have not read it,
because responses indicate that it has not been read - was released in June
and was prepared by a team at the World Health Organisation under the
conceptual framework developed by Christopher Murray and Julio Frenk in the
World Health Organisation Global Programme on Evidence for Health Policy.
They used new analytical methods and indicators to process the data that
member countries submit to the World Health Organisation.

It is perhaps surprising that the methodology was not piloted first, and
the member countries consulted on both the process and the results of the
analysis before the report was circulated globally. We accept that report,
but we must make these remarks. Participatory methods are an established
facet of public health research, and one would have expected more
consultation with policy-makers throughout the research process.

The 11 working groups that compiled the report covered such areas as basic
demography, cause of death, burden of disease,  disability-adjusted life
expectancy, health inequalities,  responsiveness of the system to the needs
of the people,  fairness of financial contribution, health systems
preferences,  national health accounts and profiles, performance analysis
and basic economic data.

Unfortunately, in this snapshot of the health systems of member states,
that is the World Health Report, the health and development situation that
countries such as South Africa faced at liberation, six years ago in our
case, and the extraordinary progress that has been made, often in the teeth
of ferocious opposition from vested groups whom I shall not name, are all
totally lost in that methodology. And unfortunately the complexities and
erudite analyses are completely buried by the headline figure of level of
attainment which all the newspapers gleefully quote.

Unfortunately, I have to say that this is a vicious kick in the teeth for
those at grass-roots level and above who have fought tirelessly and
selflessly to bring equitable health care to the people. The beneficiaries
of the programmes, however, are only too aware of where they come from, how
far they have got and where they have got.

I live in Pretoria. Only 25km from the Union Buildings there is a place
called Makaunyana, beyond Winterveld, the people there never saw a doctor
all their lives. Often they were lucky to see a nurse. There was a clinic
there which had been started by the Roman Catholic Church, which was always
in danger of being closed. For the first time, there is a clinic there, a
primary health care clinic. The people there know this. [Applause.]

Health education is given and there are opportunities to make healthy
choices. For instance, the chance to take control of their own bodies has
been given to women. Now these are the yardsticks which are used to test
and to measure this country's performance.

There is also the protection for children from pernicious and deceitful
advertising that glamourises a lethal habit such as smoking cigarettes, and
freedom from being poisoned by other people's smoke. Access to doctors is
now a reality in rural areas, through community service schemes. There is
rational prescribing through the essential drug list, which is there in
every clinic and community centre and which I saw even on the outskirts of
Durban recently. Some members do not even go to such places.
[Interjections.]

We have also seen the disappearance, increasingly, of the pathetic pictures
of children dying of diarrhoeal diseases.

Now these are the incidents that are being used to test this country. That
information was not always available to the World Health Organisation
because there was no sufficient consultation. They used country
representatives, rather than the statistics at the Department of Health and
what the people have experienced at grass-root level.

What I am saying is that there is much that we have achieved which,
unfortunately, has not been captured in the report of the World Health
Organisation. But inspite of that we received this health report, because
we back in the international community and can interact and be judged like
other countries. [Interjections.] But, before I sit down, I want to say
that they must release the results of the reduction in prices, which is
claimed to have happened. They must tell us when this happened, because the
Minister was at the meeting on the 28 September. And even at that meeting
in Geneva there was no reduction of prices.  They should not live in
fairyland and should come back to mother earth. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Debate concluded.

                           TOURISM AMENDMENT BILL

                (Election of Members of Mediation Committee)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, could you take your
seats please and stop talking. Hon Tony Leon, we are on a different item
and we also expect your participation in this.

On 13 October 2000 the House considered the Tourism Amendment Bill as
amended by the National Council of Provinces, by adopting the Report of the
Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The House refused
to pass the Bill as amended by the NCOP, that is Bill [B 50D-99]. The Bill,
as passed by the National Assembly and the amending Bill passed by the
NCOP, were therefore referred to the Mediation Committee on 13 October
2000.

In terms of section 78 of the Constitution, read with the National Assembly
Rules 225 and 226, nine members of the National Assembly must be elected by
the House to serve on the Mediation Committee. According to the formula
contained in the Rules, six members must be from the ANC and the remaining
three from the DP, IFP and the New NP respectively. The members must be
nominated by their respective parties. Parties may also nominate alternate
members for election.

Nominations were made as follows:

   On the nomination of Mr J H Momberg (on behalf of the Chief Whip of the
   Majority Party), the following members of the African National Congress
   were elected: Mr T M Goniwe; Mr M U Kalako; Mr M T Masutha; Ms S B Nqodi;
   Mr R K September; Ms M Verwoerd.

   On the nomination of Mr D H M Gibson, Ms J A Semple and Mr M L da Camara
   (alternate) of the Democratic Party were elected.

   On the nomination of Mr E J Lucas, Mrs L R Mbuyazi of the Inkatha Freedom
   Party was elected.

   On the nomination of Mr D M Bakker, Mrs M E Olckers and Mr J W le Roux
   (alternate) of the New National Party were elected.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

Dr F N GINWALA: Chairperson and hon members ...

An HON MEMBER: Order! [Laughter.]

Dr F N GINWALA: Chairperson, we might remind the House that members have to
wait before they call me to order! [Laughter.]

It was the lure of exploiting the wealth of our continent under white
hegemony that inspired Cecil Rhodes to dream of a Cape to Cairo link. More
than half a century later, it led to the notion that was promoted by P W
Botha of a constellation of African states in Southern Africa.

For the African people, the cause of African unity has been a noble and
liberating one - reflected in the Pan African Congress at the turn of the
century and shortly thereafter, by Pixley ka Seme calling for the unity of
the African people to prevent further conquest and dispossession and later,
by the founders of the ANC calling for an inclusive society in a united,
nonracial South Africa.

This liberating concept has been dominant on the continent and was
expressed at the All African People's Congress called by Nkwame Nkrumah,
and the formation of the Organisation of African Unity with a commitment to
liberate the entire continent from colonialism.

No people have more reason to appreciate the value of African unity than we
South Africans. The end of apartheid and the establishment of this
democratic Parliament came about through the support given to our struggle
by African countries, including the pressure exerted by a united Africa on
those who continued to support the apartheid regime for so long.

As the frontiers of colonial rule receded, the focus of the Organisation of
African Unity shifted from liberation to development. The declaration on
the political and economic situation in Africa and the African Charter for
Popular Participation in Development and Transformation were adopted in
1990, and a range of instruments in the years thereafter.

Three months ago, African heads of states agreed to establish an African
union with a Pan-African Parliament. Today, globalisation propels Africa
towards greater economic and political unity. For developed countries,
globalisation offers promise. For debt-ridden and poverty-stricken
economies, globalisation can be a threat to survival.

While every other region of the world has made progress over the last two
decades, the income per head in Africa as a whole is lower than what it was
in 1980. Faced with a trading system which insists on transnational capital
having carte blanche, African countries are increasingly recognising that
they will have to stand together if they are to defend or advance their own
interests.

As individual nation-states with artificial borders, they are too easily
picked-off or played against each other by the corporations and global
accountants in a postcolonial version of divide-and-rule.

Both the threat and the example of the European Union have given the idea
of an African Union new impetus. By the year 2050, Africa will have a
population of one billion people, a demographic giant. An African bloc that
brings together the mineral wealth and offshore oil fields of sub-Saharan
Africa and the oil producers in the Maghreb and in Nigeria would, indeed,
be a global force to be heeded.

In all the development in the last few decades, the voices of the people of
Africa, articulated through their elected representatives in parliament,
have been absent until now. Since the Pan-African Parliament was first
mooted, parliaments of the SADC region have resolutely maintained that
parliamentarians must be involved in its creation, and our voice is finally
being heeded.

I wish to express our appreciation to our Minister of Foreign Affairs for
her consistent support that the voice of parliaments must enter this
debate.

The OAU has convened a meeting of African parliamentarians next week to
finalise and submit to the Council of Ministers a protocol establishing a
Pan-African Parliament.

The task is not simply a technical one of drafting rules and procedures.
The principles have been spelt out in the report before us. But we also
need to consider carefully the nature of the institution we want to create,
taking account of political reality and laying sound foundations so that,
one day, this institution can grow into a parliament of all the people of
Africa, in the truest sense of the word. Much more will be needed to be
done, however, before that can be realised.

Africa has witnessed a number of attempts at union between countries,
motivated by idealism, but frequently hastily conceived and ill-prepared,
often built on the shifting sounds of political rhetoric, and blown asunder
by the harsh winds of political reality. Creating a continental union and
its institutions is a far greater challenge, but the need was never more
greater. The development and strengthening of African unity needs to go
hand in hand with the building of institutions.

In doing so, we will have to recognise and take account of the racial,
ethnic, religious, political, linguistic and cultural diversity of our
continent, the differing colonial experiences and the levels of political
and economic development. It will not be enough to simply acknowledge this.
More importantly, we have to respect this diversity.

Apartheid projected this country as a part of Europe, rather than a African
country. This has left its imprint, as is visible in much of the public
discourse. We need to educate, redefine and correct our own perceptions as
Africans and, if I may presume to say, to be less arrogant as we look at
the rest of the continent, for we have much to learn.

South Africans are justly proud of our Constitution and our democracy, but
we have no universal or perfect answer. After all, we have a long way to go
before this institution is fully representative of our population. For a
start, we need more representatives from the rural areas, trade unions and
business, and more young people and, at least, 80 to 90 more women. In many
other ways, we have yet to expand the democratic content of this
institution.

Our democracy is based on the Westminister system, and this is not
necessarily the best. After a degree of hesitation, the no- party system of
Uganda has been accepted by the Commonwealth as providing a democratic
parliament. Elsewhere, we might find other models.
What will be important for the Pan-African Parliament is not to be
prescriptive, but to build it on universal principles which, we accept, can
be applied differently in various countries.

The most important role of the Pan-African parliament in the immediate
future must be to provide a forum for free and open debate on a range of
issues, including the African condition and possible solutions, the relief
of poverty and the management of globalisation.

The parliament can serve to develop a common understanding of Africa and
our common future and, thereby, help to strengthen economic ties and
relations. Our dialogue can inform and create a culture of human rights and
peace and educate people on the resolution of difference and conflict
through discussion and negotiation rather than violence and war. We can
contribute to the creation of stability and the prevention of war.

Importantly, such a forum would strengthen and spread democracy,
reinforcing the will of African leaders to remove from their midst those
who come to power through military coups, or abuse and manipulate power for
personal gain. The Pan-African Parliament could protect the rights and
freedoms of the African people and raise a collective voice to gaurd,
develop and defend democracy and its institutions. There is much that we
can do.

Today this House must, I submit, express its support for the establishment
of the Pan-African Parliament, and commit itself to our full co-operation
and participation in it. [Applause.]

Mr C NQAKULA: Mr Chairperson and hon members, the ANC is committed to the
ideal of the African Renaissance. Millions of other Africans support this.
Consequently, we see the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament as an
additional building block towards the fulfilment of the vision of the
African century.

As South Africans we should welcome the new emergence of a structure that
will provide us with a new platform to advance the cause for democratic
engagement between Africa's peoples. The fight to establish peace,
stability and sustainable development on the African continent will need a
co-ordinated approach. All of us will need to work together to attain the
objectives of the African Renaissance.

Since 1994 South Africa has argued for the transformation of some of the
key structures internationally, that impact on the lives of people, like
the UN and its various organs and the OAU. The decision to phase out the
OAU and establish the African union is a response to the need for better
unity and political cohesion to address the new challenges facing the
continent. We must prepare ourselves well as South Africans to respond
appropriately, understanding our role in bringing in the new arrangements.

The ANC believes that the Pan-African Parliament is both an opportunity and
a challenge to fully integrate ourselves into the political and economic
development of the continent. The Pan-African Parliament will provide us
with the crucial platform to discuss our relations with the rest of the
continent. There is a lot that we will learn from Africa, parts of which
have been independent for several decades compared to our six years of
freedom. The oft-repeated view that we are the only light in an otherwise
dark continent is erroneous. I repeat: There is a lot that we will learn
from Africa.
Africa will also learn a lot from us, given our negotiated settlement and
the experience we gained in uniting former oppressors and freedom fighters
to draw a new constitution to establish democracy in South Africa. However,
we are not only a repository for democracy in Africa. Like elsewhere in the
continent, we were colonised. The colonisers raped our land and our raw
materials. Our way of life was destroyed and we were oppressed as slaves or
as voiceless people with no rights in the land of their birth.

The independence of a continent, which was brought about in many instances
by years of intense liberation wars could not address all the evils of
colonialism despite the new freedom it secured. Fortunately for posterity,
evidence is being uncovered in many historical sites in some parts of
Africa to prove how advanced some of our communities were on the continent.


However, we should not blame all our weaknesses on colonisation. There is
much that has been done by Africans themselves that has further pushed the
continent into an abyss of greed and corruption, where the elite design
better lives for themselves through easy access to national resources and
allow a slide in the standards of living for the poor.

Indeed, Africa should blame herself for the conflicts resulting in the many
wars on the continent. Greedy and corrupt leaders perpetuate these
conflicts to remain in power and continue to loot the national resources.

Of course, the avarice of some of Africa's leaders is not the only factor
that has caused Africa's economic problems. Many countries inherited
economies that were in decline following years of systematic mismanagement
by the colonial authorities. The two decades leading up to the advent of
democracy in 1994 in South Africa were characterised by an economy whose
growth remained at negative levels compared to the population growth. This
led, among other things, to increasing unemployment.

In 1994 between a quarter and a third of people fit for work were
unemployed. There were also major sections of all social sectors that the
economy could not support. Consequently, poor people were getting poorer.
Africa has also been a victim of the structural adjustment programmes of
the IMF and the World Bank. Their loans have not helped the continent out
of rampant poverty, deprivation and underdevelopment. Africa in fact is
tottering under the heavy burden of a debt it owes to the developed world.

Many countries on the continent cannot service that debt. Neo-colonialism
has taken over where colonialism left off and poverty continues unabated.
All manner of diseases continue to ravage the African population. Africa
needs to unite, therefore, under the aegis of the structures for democracy
that the continent has and intends to establish, such as the Pan-African
Parliament, to further the struggle to change for the better her
contribution to and benefit from the economy of the world. As part of a
programme of united action, Africa needs to struggle to free herself from
the role she played in the past as a preserve for colonialism.

The Pan-African Parliament will create space for discussion and the
formulation of possible strategies to address the conflicts that have
gripped the continent in an orgy of bloodletting in countries such as
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo, just to mention a couple. It
should be borne in mind, though, that the parliament would be consultative
and will not have legislative powers. Of course, it will not replace
efforts at other levels to correct some of the weaknesses from which the
African continent suffers. For instance, it will not attempt to take over
the peace negotiations conducted by such luminaries as our former President
Nelson Mandela and Botswana Sir Ketumile Masire.

The African parliamentarians who represent their nations at the Pan-African
Parliament should use that structure to share their experiences in building
democracy. They should help each other to build, on the African continent,
democratic political dispensations that would be people-centred. They
should share the benefits of Africa's knowledge systems that were built
over many years in the fields of art, culture and technology. They should
discuss ways and means to help our people to overcome some of the
chauvinism that still creates conditions for xenophobia, tribalism and
racism. In a nutshell, they should discuss and plan how to create a
continent that would be free of conflict, ignorance, disease, starvation,
homelessness, joblessness and corruption. [Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND: Chairperson, Africa desperately needs vigorous economic
growth, inherent to the bedrock principles of democracy, and an environment
of expanding opportunity for all. To the extent that the Pan-African
Parliament can, and we generally hope will, help to achieve this end, the
DP and the DA supports the establishment of such a parliament. To this end
we particularly endorse comments and amendments made by the Department of
Foreign Affairs in their revised draft of the annotated version of the Pan-
African Parliament protocol. Their suggested additions to the preamble that
focus on the promotion of democratic priniciples and the protection of
human rights would surely add value not only to the protocol document, but
to the concept of a Pan-African Parliament itself.

Some people, I am quite sure, will take issue on the question of democracy.
They will ask: How do you define a democracy? Surely there are different
variations of democracy. Democracy is subjective. Frankly, that kind of
commentator is at best naive, and at worst, politically manipulative and
mischievous.

Universal adult suffrage, regular free and fair elections, respect for
human rights and the separation of powers in a free society are the
absolute basic minimums for any democracy. A Pan-African Parliament must
demand this as a precondition for membership. Anything less would be to the
detriment of our continent.

Now is not the time, and a new Pan-African Parliament is not the place to
rally around tyrants in a misguided show of African solidarity against the
world.

Muammar Gaddafi has been at the forefront of the charge to establish a Pan-
African Parliament. But Libya, under Gaddafi, is a perfect example of a
state that should be banned from membership of a Pan-African parliament.
[Interjections.] Omran al-Fitouri and 23 others accused of taking part in
opposition activities were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1991,
following a trial that failed to meet international standards of free and
fair trial. Sound familiar? [Interjections.]

Amnesty International, in its 1998 report entitled ``Libya: Gross Human
Rights Violations Amid Secrecy and Isolation'', condemns Libyan law, which
authorises collective punishment for communities deemed to have helped
opposition activists. This includes cutting off of water and electricity to
so-called ``guilty'' villages, depriving so-called ``guilty'' villages of
subsidised food, petrol and public services, and transferring development
projects to other parts of the country.

If we allow the inclusion of a 30-year-old tyranny into a Pan-African
Parliament, let alone allow it to be the driving force behind it, it will
be nothing less than expensive sham. [Interjections.]

The slow, stable, fragmented cold war system that dominated this world
since 1945 has been replaced by a new, very greased, interconnected system
- we have spoken about it today - called ``globalisation.''

The main thrust behind globalisation is the free market and healthy
competition. As Thomas Friedman in his book ``The Lexus and the Olive
Tree,'' eloquently puts it:


  The symbol of the cold war was a wall which divided everybody. The symbol
  of globalisation is the Worldwide Web which unites everyone.

The cold war was about Einstein's equation, which is e=mc2. Globalisation
is about Moore's law which states that the computing power of silicon chips
will double every 18 to 24 months. The cold war was about ``how big is your
missile?'' Globalisation is about ``how fast is your modem?''

Africa must embrace the free market and competition, and declare proudly
and loudly that Africa is open for business. Africa is a world-class choice
for direct foreign investment. Clem Sunter, in his book and presentation
entitled, Never mind the millennium. What about the next 24 hours?, said ``
... as opposed to the kind of `rolling mass action' we see so much of, what
Africa need is rolling individual action.

Entrepreneurs working in SMMEs - energetic, risk-taking opportunists - are
the future. They will build up the South African and the African economies
from the bottom up, and make us the kind of global competitors we know we
can be.

India is a country that faces the same social problems that many African
countries face. India has become the back office of the world. Swissair has
moved its entire accounting division from Switzerland to India where there
are low costs for IT professionals, and it makes good business sense. In
today's digital world, Swissair can have its financial department in Bern
or Mumbai as easily as it can have it in Bloemfontein and Bamako.
[Interjections.]
Africa will never ... [Interjections] ... reach its potential without this
sort of economic growth and development. For a Pan-African parliament to be
relevant and useful, it must embrace the realities of globalisation. It
must become an engine room and a motivator for real economic development.

Article 4 of the treaty that established the African Economic Community is
a good place for a new Pan-African Parliament to begin, in terms of
economic growth.

A Pan-African Parliament must promote an economic growth and development in
order to increase economic self-reliance and an indigenous and self-
sustained development. It must also promote the liberalisation of trade and
actively motivate nation states to empower and encourage entrepreneurs. If
it is going to be a talkshop, it must be the kind of talkshop and talk that
Africa needs.

A Pan-African Parliament must also not allow us, for even one second, to
deflect attention from important issues here in our country and in our
region. The founding treaty of SADC mentions:


  ... the need to involve the peoples of the region centrally in the
  process of development and integration, particularly through the
  guarantees of democratic rights, observance of human rights and the rule
  of law.

The question that must be asked is: Have the countries that comprise SADC,
either individually or collectively, done enough to ensure that this
democratic commitment, which is central to regional development and
integration, becomes a reality?

Despite our problems, a zone of relatively progressive democratic and
economic governance has emerged in the triangle of South Africa, Botswana
and Mozambique. The danger within SADC lies in the quadrangle of the
authoritarian and militaristic regimes that are constituted by Angola, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zimbabwe.

SADC is riddled with as much potential as there are problems. We also have
serious issues facing us right here in South Africa. Massive unemployment,
rampant HIV/Aids and spiraling crime are our biggest and most important
challenges. As parliamentarians, we must focus on the elimination of these
serious problems.

A Pan-African Parliament can, potentially, if properly constituted and
correctly focused, help each individual African nation-state to develop and
grow. It can also help to inject vitality and sanity into SADC. It can do
all these things if it embraces economic growth and real democracy.
[Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, hon members, the leaders of the African
continent have long recognised that co-operation and integration among
African countries in the economic, social and cultural fields were
indispensable to the accelerated transformation and sustained development
of the African continent. This commitment was enunciated in the charter
that established the Organisation for African Unity in 1963, and was
further expanded in the OAU Summits of 1973 and 1976 and the Monrovia
Declaration of 1979.

Further impetus was added in 1980, when the OAU Extraordinary Summit
adopted the Lagos Plan of Action. In this plan, African leaders stated
their individual and collective commitment to promoting the economic
integration of Africa as a continent. African leaders also committed
themselves to establishing national, regional and sub-regional institutions
that would become the main vehicles to achieve the ultimate goal of a
dynamic and interdependent African economy, thus paving the way for the
eventual establishment of the African Economic Community.

The commitments of the Lagos Plan of Action found concrete expression in
Abuja, Nigeria, in June 1991 when the OAU Heads of State and Government
signed the treaty that established the African economic Community. The
African Economic Community Treaty has been in operation since May 1994 when
the required number of instruments of ratification for its coming into
force were deposited with the Secretary-General of the Organisation for
African Unity and African Economic Community.

Articles 6 and 88 of the Abuja Treaty determine that the African Economic
Community will be established in six stages of variable duration over a
transition period not exceeding 34 years. The establishment of the Pan-
African Parliament, as one of the components of the African Economic
Community, falls in Stage 6 of this process.

An ad hoc committee of this House was established to consider a draft
protocol to the Abuja treaty, whereby the Pan-African Parliament would be
established. Its report on the draft portfolio is before us today. The IFP
supports the consensus report of the ad hoc committee, which contains nine
points relating to the principles of the protocol. I do not wish to repeat
all nine points here, but would like to comment on a few of the more
important ones.

Firstly, the Pan-African Parliament should be a deliberative body without
any law-making powers. It should be obvious that giving a supranational
body legislative powers would possibly infringe on the sovereignty of
member states and the legislative authority of their parliaments. It is
therefore clear that the Pan-African Parliament should not have law-making
powers, but this brings with it the danger that the Pan-African Parliament
might become little more than a talk shop, using scarce resources. I am not
suggesting that consultation and debate is worthless, but great care should
be taken to avoid a hollow, useless institution that would be more
ceremonial than anything else.

Secondly, the Pan-African Parliament should be composed of eight members
from each member state, appointed by each national parliament from its
ranks on the basis of a broad representivity with a minimum of three women
members. A number of comments are relevant in this case.

First, appointment to the Pan-African Parliament from national parliaments
should be the guiding principle. But what will happen in the case of member
states that do not have national parliaments or any form of elective
representation? Will they be excluded from the Pan-African Parliament, or
will another vehicle have to be found in their case? The protocol aimed at
establishing the Pan-African Parliament is silent on these practical
difficulties.

Second, the minimum of three women per delegation is supported, but there
is a danger that this could infringe on the cultural tradition of some
member states. The question is whether all member states would be able to
comply with this requirement and, if not, whether they would or could be
forced to comply.

Thirdly, some general objectives of the Pan-African Parliament should be
inserted in the draft protocol. The IFP agrees with the statement, but it
is our contention that more clarity could have been provided on the nature
of the general objectives that need to be included in the protocol. At the
very least, the objectives should be in line with the fundamental
objectives of the treaty that established the African Economic Community.

Fourthly, direct elections of members of the Pan-African Parliament would
not be appropriate. We fully agree with the statement. Continental
elections for the Pan-African Parliament are unrealistic as is the idea
that uniform electoral laws would be created within a reasonable time
period, when representatives of governments and parliaments are not common
to all the member states.

The IFP supports the report of the ad hoc committee on the Pan-African
Parliament that is being considered in this House today. It is our fervent
hope that the Pan-African Parliament will be able to play a significant
role in the integration of the African continent. There is no doubt that
this integration will assist Africans to assist themselves through economic
development, social co-operation and sharing a common political vision for
our continent. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Madam Speaker, the New NP and the DP, and the DA that is
currently giving the ANC a hard time in the municipal elections ...
[Interjections] ... support the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament
which will be a deliberative body without law-making powers. We also
support the report of the ad hoc committee. There is, indeed, a need for
African parliamentarians to develop common positions on the huge challenges
facing the continent. If Africa were committed to the promotion of
democracy, as it should be, then article 3 of the draft protocol to the
treaty establishing the Pan-African Parliament should be amended in order
to ensure that all delegations also include members of opposition parties.
The voice of the opposition in Africa, frequently wrongly branded as
enemies of the state, has been disregarded too long, and this is only to
the detriment of the continent.

A parliament without an opposition is in any case a contradition in terms.
What is really a contradiction in terms is the fact that the Pan-African
Parliament is actually the brainchild of a dictator par excellence, and my
colleague in the DP referred to that in an excellent speech. Col Muammar
Gaddafi of Libya is actually the father of this African Parliament in its
present form.
The Abuja Treaty originally provided for the establishment of a Pan-African
Parliament during the sixth stage of a process scheduled to last 34 years.
The African Parliament, in terms of the Abuja Treaty, was only supposed to
be established once regional economic communities, a customs union at
continental level, an African common market, a Pan-African market and
monetary union, an African central bank, and a single African currency were
firmly established.

Then suddenly last year, at Sirte in Libya, the African heads of state,
apparently inspired by Col Gaddafi, decided to replace the Organisation of
African Unity with the African Union, and simultaneously to fast-track the
establishment of the Pan-African Parliament, now provided for not in terms
of the Abuja Treaty, but in terms of article 17 of the constitutive act of
the African Union which takes precedence over the Abuja Treaty.

This is simply mind-boggling. The man who recently said, ``Africa needs
food and medicine, it does not need lessons on democracy,'' has now become
the founding father of the Pan-African Parliament.

The Sirte declaration leaves no one in the dark in this regard and I quote:


  In our deliberations, we have been inspired by the important proposals
  submitted by Col Gaddafi, leader of the great Al Fatah Libyan revolution.

However, if the Pan-African Parliament wants to lay claim to any
credibility, despite its dubious origin, adherence to democratic principles
should be a prerequisite for membership, and Mr Clelland referred to that.

Dictatorships, ironically such as Libya and quasi-democracies, should not
be allowed to join the Pan-African Parliament. President Mbeki set the tone
when he suggested that rulers who came to power through the barrel of a gun
should be barred from all OAU activities. Current members of the OAU and
the African Union should not be allowed to automatically become members of
the Pan-African Parliament.

The Pan-African Parliament should actually have stricter criteria for
membership than the Organisation of African Unity, or the envisaged African
Union, otherwise it will ridicule the very concept of democracy. The
argument, also raised during the discussions in the committee, that
democratic principles cannot be a prerequisite for membership because there
are different definitions of democracy, does not hold water.
[Interjections.]

Democratic principles, as is the case with human rights, are universal and
constitute the following: governing by consent of the people, respect for
the rule of law, and upholdment of human rights. Adherence to these
principles could and should, therefore, serve as a prerequisite for
membership of the Pan-African Parliament. Second-class democracies are no
longer acceptable for Africa.

The hon speaker referred to the fact that the no-party parliament of Uganda
is, in fact, a democracy. I think a no-party parliament is actually also a
contradiction in terms. [Interjections.] The de facto replacement of the
Abuja Treaty by the Constitutive Act of the African Union, although it is
supposed to be a step forward is, in my mind, a step backwards.

It is actually a revival of Nkruma's political kingdom to the detriment of
the economic kingdom without which the African renaissance will never
materialise. If one analyses the objectives of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union and the Abuja Treaty - hon members should please go and
analyse these objectives - one will see that it is a shift away from the
economic goals embodied in the Abuja Treaty to mainly political objectives
contained in the Constitutive Act.

Natuurlik hang daar ook groot vraagtekens oor die inwerkingstelling van die
Abuja-verdrag. Dit staan egter soos 'n paal bo water dat sterk
streeksekonomieë, gekenmerk deur vryhandelsgebiede, Afrika se enigste
behoud is in 'n mededingende wêreldekonomie waar globalisering hoogty vier.

 
Eweneens staan dit soos 'n paal bo water dat 'n Pan-Afrika-parlement, as
eindproduk van 'n geïntegreerde-ekonomiese gemeenskap in Afrika, soos
voorsien deur die Abuja-verdrag, 'n veel gewigtiger instelling sou wees as
die politieke praathuis wat nou op grond van 'n diktator se inisiatief tot
stand gebring word.

Desondanks steun die Nuwe NP, die DP, en die Demokratiese Alliansie, wat
loshande die munisipale verkiesing in die Wes-Kaap gaan wen, die stigting
van 'n Pan-Afrika-parlement. [Applous.] (Translations of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Of course, there is great uncertainty about the implementation of the
Abuja Treaty. However, it is an incontrovertible fact that strong regional
economies, characterized by free trade areas, will be Africa’s only hope of
salvation in a competitive world economy in which globalisation reigns
supreme.

Similarly, it is an incontrovertible fact that a Pan-African Parliament as
the ultimate outcome of an integrated economic community in Africa, as
envisaged in the Abuja Treaty, would be a much more important institution
than the political talkshop which is now being established on the
initiative of a dictator.

Nevertheless, the New NP, the DP and the Democratic Alliance, which is
going to win the municipal election in the Western Cape hands down, support
the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament. [Applause.]]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Madam Speaker, the initiative taken by the Speaker of the
South African Parliament in calling this debate, derives from a very rich
commitment and determination of the people on our continent to establish a
Pan-African socio political forum as the basis for the exchange of ideas
and strategies in die development of Africa as a continent.

Underlying this commitment are serious resolutions such as the 1990
declaration adopted in Addis Ababa, the 1991 treaty establishing the
African Economic Community, the agenda for action endorsed in June 1995 in
Addis Ababa, the Algiers Declaration which affirms the commitments which
were signed in 1999 and, finally, the Sert Declaration at the Socialist
People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya signed in September 1999, which called for
the speedy establishment of the institutions provided for in the Abuja
Treaty and which includes the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament
by the year 2000.

We must, as a people, be proud of the role that hon Madam Speaker has
played in the involvement of South Africa in these honourable continental
undertakings. Our country has correctly demonstrated its commitment to the
spirit and vision of continentalism in addressing common African problems.
It is this spirit of solidarity that will strengthen our efforts, variously
and collectively, to interact with the international community in a manner
that protects and promotes true African interests.

That these common objectives are seen to be most likely achieveable through
a parliamentary process is evidence of Africa's commitment to democracy. It
is clear from the abovementioned declarations and treaties that the idea of
a Pan-African Parliament is not a passing thought or a simple gimmick.
Neither is it a party-political tool to be used for narrow, parochial
games.

Rather, it is firmly based on the conviction that the establishment of a
Pan-African Parliament will ensure, effectively, the full participation of
the African peoples in the economic development and the integration of the
continent. This is all the more of crucial importance given the ugly face
of globalisation and the monopolisation of agenda-setting therein by the
rich countries from the north. Every effort must be made to strengthen the
Pan-African parliamentary system once it is established.

It is evident from the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Pan-African
Parliament of the National Assembly of the South African Parliament that we
attach a high value to inclusivity. The committee's proposal that an equal
number of delegates from every member state be appointed to this Pan-
African Parliament is commendable because it promotes the principles of
inclusivity and egalite. Inclusivity is a useful vehicle for the cross-
pollination of ideas and practices.

Contrary to the position held by others, such as the DP and the NP, old or
new, the UDM foresees no problem in countries such as Libya and Angola
being party to this institution. In fact, indeed, we believe that they are
an integral part of the creation of a Pan-African Parliament. We must get
rid of this exclusivity which is so characteristic of what held back this
country for so many decades. All true Africans accept this reasoning.

Democracy is powerful enough to influence those who do not practice it. How
does one change people's thinking if one does not speak with them? Speakers
touched on the vital need for South Africa to avoid, at all costs, being
arrogant in the role we have to play. The phasing out of the OAU and its
replacement by an African union is a giant step for Africa, and this
transition must be carefully nurtured.
While South Africa has, indeed, a contribution to make, it must never
presume that it has a monopoly on solutions. There is a lot to learn from
our continental neighbours, if the continent is to become the global force
that it deserves to be. The UDM lends its full support to the report of the
Ad Hoc Committee on Pan-African Parliament. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Ministers and members, the object of the Pan-
African Parliament is to ensure that the peoples of Africa are fully
involved in the economic development and integration of the continent. This
is, indeed, a noble ideal.

In September 1999, at the fourth extraordinary summit of the OAU/AEC in
Sirte, Libya, heads of state and government adopted the Sirte Declaration,
wherein African leaders decided to establish an African union by the year
2001. A year later, however, we read in The Economist, dated 13 October,
about increased violence against black people in Libya, the same country.
This is stark, crude racism which must be condemned in the same manner we
have condemned racism in South Africa.

It was reported that hundreds of thousands of black immigrants were herded
into trucks and buses, driven to a town south of Tripoli and dumped into
the desert. The article explained how the president of Ghana flew to
Tripoli and brought back home 250 Ghanaian workers.

Colonel Gaddafi is a strong supporter of a Pan-African Parliament. He heads
Africa's richest state in terms of income per person. But Libyans, feeding
their families on monthly salaries of only $150, see their money squandered
on foreign adventures, the latest of which is Colonel Gaddafi's Pan-African
policy.

Africa has a social and moral obligation to get its house in order, but
this cannot start unless we govern our own countries according to
principles of human dignity, shared responsibility, co-operative relations
and democratic values.

Can we obtain these objectives through the establishment of a Pan-African
Parliament? The ACDP thinks: not so! A Pan-African Parliament in the hands
of a dictator could be a disaster. The ACDP is, therefore, not in support
of the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament. It is our firm resolution
that the objectives of the Pan-African parliament could have been
established within the broader framework of the OAU. [Time expired.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairperson, if one studies the state of the world
politically after the Cold War, Africa is not important any more, and is
being marginalised by the big political powers. If one studies the world
economically after the Cold War, Africa is not a priority, and is being
marginalised by the big economic forces in the world.
What do I deduce from these two lessons? Firstly, I deduce that Africa must
solve its own problems and look after itself and, secondly, that in
establishing a Pan-African Parliament or any other structure Africa may not
fail again.

Teen hierdie agtergrond steun die VF die verslag van die ad hoc-komitee vir
'n pan-Afrika-parlement, maar ons móét waarsku dat om 'n suksesvolle,
stabiele pan-Afrika-parlement in werking te stel, daar heelwat voorwaardes
is wat ek nie almal kan behandel nie. Die een is dat 'n mens eers
suksesvolle en stabiele state moet hê, want die state is die boustene van
so 'n parlement. Sekerlik is Angola nie so 'n stabiele staat nie. Sekerlik
is die Demokratiese Republiek van Kongo nie so 'n stabiele staat nie, en so
kan ek 'n klomp ander noem.

Kom ons leer by die wêreld en gaan kyk hoe hulle geslaag het waar daar
sukses was hiermee. Die Europese Unie, wat op 'n ekonomiese grondslag gebou
is en daarna die Europese Parlement tot gevolg gehad het, is 'n goeie
voorbeeld waaruit 'n mens wel kan lesse leer. Wat is hulle resep? Terwyl
Europa ekonomies al sterker saamgewerk het en ekonomies een geword het, het
daar in die afgelope vyf jaar 14 nuwe state in Europa ontstaan.

Terselfdertyd word politieke mag in lande soos België en Spanje al hoe meer
gedesentraliseer na provinsies, taalstreke en outonome gebiede om politieke
stabiliteit te verseker. Agb lede kan gerus John Naisbitt se nuutste boek,
Global Paradox, gaan lees, waarin hy hierdie eienaardigheid bespreek. Hy sê
op bladsy 11:


  All over the world people are agreeing to trade more freely with each
  other, and all over the world people are asserting their political
  independence, their distinctiveness.

Ons stem saam met die verslag soos dit hier staan, en spesifiek met
paragraaf 2(1) wat sê dat dit net 'n beraadslagende liggaam moet wees. Om
egter stabiliteit te kry in state, en dit geld ook vir Suid-Afrika, moet
politieke mag ook gedesentraliseer word en na onder afgewentel word. Daarna
kan 'n mens ekonomies saamwerk. Dit is die resep tans in die wêreld, en ons
moenie daarvan wegskram nie. Ek vra agb lede weer eens om Global Paradox
van John Naisbitt te gaan lees, waarin hy die kwessie bespreek.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Against this background the FF supports the report of the ad hoc committee
on a Pan-African Parliament, but we must warn that to put a successful,
stable Pan-African Parliament into operation there are quite a number of
conditions, all of which I cannot deal with. The one is that one must first
have successful and stable states, because the states are the building
blocks of such a parliament. Certainly the Democratic Republic of Congo is
not such a stable state, and so I can mention quite a few more.

Let us learn from the world and go and look at how they succeeded where
they had success with this. The European Union, which is based on an
economic foundation and which led to the establishment of the European
Parliament, is a good example from which one can learn some lessons. What
is their recipe? While Europe has co-operated more vigorously and become
one economically, 14 new states have arisen in Europe during the past five
years.

At the same time, in countries such as Belgium and Spain political power is
becoming more decentralised to the provinces, language regions and
autonomous areas to ensure political stability. Hon members should read
John Naisbitt’s latest book, Global Paradox, in which he discusses this
curiosity. He says on page 11:

   All over the world people are agreeing to trade more freely with each
   other, and all over the world people are asserting their political
   independence, their distinctiveness.

We agree with the report as it stands, and specifically with paragraph
2(1), which says that it must be a consultative body only. However, to
achieve stability in states, and this goes for South Africa too, political
power must be decentralisd and devolved downwards. Afterwards one can co-
operate economically. This is the recipe that is at present being followed
in the world, and we should not shy away from it. I want to ask hon members
once again to read Global Paradox by John Naisbitt in which he discussed
the issue.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, the peoples of Africa are becoming aware
that they have a common destiny. As the cherry of the mother continent they
seek a common identity. A treaty establishing the African Economic
Community was signed in Abuja, Nigeria, in 1991 and sought, amongst other
things, to establish the Pan-African Parliament. This is a noble step that
has to be hailed by all who are interested in the welfare of Africa.

In setting up a Pan-African Parliament, the UCDP proposes that the
representation by member states should take into account population density
of each member state. Countries less densely populated should have fewer
members. Membership to the Pan-African Parliament should take cognisance of
all political parties in the parliaments of the member states, to avoid the
monopoly of representation by ruling parties.

We support the proposal that members of the PAP should be members of
parliament in their countries. However, the poser would be that parliaments
are elected at different times and the likelihood is that non of the
members of PAP may complete their proposed tenure of five years. Members of
the Pan-African Parliament should be allowed to vote in their personal and
independent capacity, as this allows more freedom. A common approach has to
be sought in order to ensure that membership of the Pan-African Parliament
is in keeping with fundamental rights in which no one is disadvantaged on
grounds of gender, religion or otherwise.

Among the envisaged functions and powers, one that has to be put into
practise is that which deals with the harmonisation and co-ordination of
the laws of member states. The UCDP is therefore strongly against the
proposal that the budget of the Pan-African Parliament should be approved
by heads of state and government. Our position is that people should be
given responsibility with accountability. Parliamentarians in the continent
should be on the level of being able to account for their deeds.

The rotation of parliament will assist in opening the window through which
member states can learn what is going on in other countries. We fully
support the view that the status quo should remain in so far as the medium
of communication in the Pan-African Parliament is concerned. The UCDP
support the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Pan-African Parliament.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker and hon members, I wish to remind all of us
that the vision and quest for a Pan-African Parliament was conceived
alongside, if not within, the very movement of Pan-Africanism, which is
Africa seeking to unite and rediscover herself. From the epoch of Marcus
Garvey through to the era of Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah and others up to this
day, the yearning for a united Africa still lingers on, though bedevilled
by  Africa's tinpot republics and torn asunder by conflict, internal and
civil strife, poverty, corruption and general decline.

The existing sad state of affairs clouded Amilcar Cabral's plea when he
said:


  I am a simple African who wishes only to pay his debt to his own people
  and to live to the full of his epoch. May we all pay our debts to our
  people and live fully our own time.
I would also like to quote Oginga Odinga:
  Nkrumah talked of the problems of emancipating other African colonies, of
  the inspiration of Pan Africanism and his conviction of a Pan African
  government.

Oginga Odinga reflects on the above in his book, Not Yet Uhuru.

Our quest and search for a Pan-African government should not turn a blind
eye to Africa's problems such as the lack of a well-rooted and sustainable
democracy, deep-seated ethnic prejudices, despotism, poverty, including the
uphill struggle for economic development, health and social welfare relief.

What is our view of the performance of the Organisation of African Unity
over the past two or three decades? Has this institution served any
meaningful and effective role? Does the body need fundamental overhauling
or should we put it away forever in our African museum? The immediate
question seems to be whether or not the envisaged Pan-African parliament
will subsume the OAU or whether it will be established side by side with
the OAU.

Paul Niger, in his poem ``Je n'aime pas l'Afrique'' made the assertion that
Africa is going to speak because it is her time and turn to make demands.
The sentiments expressed are quite legitimate but the hard reality is not
as compatible. The myriad of problems besetting the continent have made
African unity a very, very slow process and an elusive one, too.

It may be Africa's time, and the African century, but that is no indication
that it is timeous and prudent to have an African parliament now before its
sovereign component parts have put their countries on a proper footing
regarding democratisation, social and economic upliftment including self-
reliance. In this day and age, a club of hard-working and self-sufficient
participants is better than a league of beggars passing the bowl around.

It is imperative that we approach the project with great circumspection
without rushing headlong into self-defeating conclusions about this very
selfsame envisaged project. The general ideas of unity and co-operation are
virtuous and very welcome, but these can only be realised if each of the
participating sovereign countries stabilised and democratised themselves
and became economically geared to achieve prosperity and self-sustenance.

The guidelines as spelt out by the Ad Hoc Committee on Pan-African
Parliament should, in our view, not precede indepth discussion on the state
of affairs prevailing in each of the prospective participating countries or
role-players. The concerns raised in this contribution, including the
proposed ad hoc committee guidelines, need further critique and fine-
tuning.

The DP and its alliance partners are quite willing and prepared to
participate in further exploring this project to achieve implementable
outcomes that will enhance democracy, economic growth, self-reliance and
development, including stability and prosperity in this continent.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria,
a great Pan-Africanist, said:


  Africa will one day have a parliament of African states, a Pan-African
  court of justice, a Pan-African High Command and common market.

The formation of a Pan-African Parliament is not a new thing. It did not
begin with Colonel Muammar Gadaffi. Pan-Africanists all over the world have
worked hard for many years for the realisation of the Pan-African vision.
The colonel merely reminded of it when those who in their poverty of
originality and perfidious mutilation of history tried to destroy the Pan-
African vision.

Africa must be reconstructed to her former beauty. The struggle to restore
Africa to her destroyed glory must not be an imitation of the European
Renaissance which facilitated the darkness of the transatlantic slave trade
and colonialism, ravaged Africa's riches and brainwashed Africa's people
psychologically.

As part of the unconquerable Pan-African movement, the PAC of Azania
endorses the principle of establishing a Pan-African Parliament. An Africa
built on the firm foundation of Pan-Africanism will have the technological
capacity to process all her raw materials in Africa and export them as
finished products. This will enable Africans to control their economies,
banish poverty from the shores of Africa and withstand the onslaught of
globalisation, which is the partnership of the rich and the poor in which
western nations are riders and Africa is their horse.
A divided Africa will be swallowed by this plutocracy. Without Pan-African
unity as expounded by visionaries such as Nkrumah, Sobukwe, Modibo Keita
and Sekou Toure, Africa's liberation will remain a myth.

Mr M A MANGENA: Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the draft protocol
relating to the establishment of the Pan-African parliament, as it stands,
raises some serious constitutional,  legal, political and practical
problems for this country and others on the continent.

A natural and instinctive tendency would be to hold our own constitutional
and legal regime supreme, and push away at anything that seeks to alter or
contaminate that regime. In the defence of our Constitution and laws, we
would demand that the protocol and the Pan-African Parliament itself be
shaped in such a way that they comply with our Constitution and the laws
emanating from it.

Our continent, fragmented as it is into small states, for the most part
with small populations settled with very low levels of infrastrucural,
economic and social development, cannot be a meaningful player in the world
political and economic affairs. Therefore, the establishment of the Pan-
African Parliament as an important element of the economic integration of
Africa is a crucial and epoch-making development for our continent.

If approached with commitment and dedication by most member countries, the
Pan-African Parliament could contribute a lot towards the upliftment and
improvement of the lives of the people on our continent. We should
therefore be prepared, where appropriate, to subjugate some aspects of our
Constitution and laws to the African Union and the Pan-African Parliament,
in order to advance continental unity.

For now, Azapo believes it is appropriate that the Pan-African Parliament
should have only deliberative functions, and that its members be elected by
the national parliaments of member countries. But we should be prepared to
give it more and more powers and functions as time goes on. It must not be
a rushed job. It must be a step-by-step process. [Applause.]

Mr D A HANEKOM: Madam Speaker and hon members, I am sure we have all seen
stickers saying ``I love Soweto'', ``I love Cape Town'', ``I love
cricket'', and so forth. The 21 members of the Ad Hoc Committee on Pan-
African Parliament all have T-shirts which say ``I love Africa''. Of
course, we do. We live on this continent. We love this continent. We are
proud of the achievements of the African people, the beauty of the
continent and its cultural richness.
In the evolutionary chain, the first mammals who could be called human
beings were born on this continent. The Sterkfontein area in our own
country is rightfully called the cradle of humankind.

But we are also painfully aware of the widespread underdevelopment,
poverty, illiteracy, disease and hunger on our own continent.

We are aware of the growing gap between the rich and the poor. In Dr Pallo
Jordan's words, during the debate on ``Making the 21st Century an African
Century'' said:


  The challenge facing our continent is to pursue rapid economic growth and
  development while keeping faith with democratic norms and principles.

Indeed, hon members these are our challenges. Our continent was plundered
and brutally exploited by centuries of colonial rule. The legacy remains
with us. This is not something distant and academic. The majority of our
own citizens were subjected to a special kind of colonialism which ended
just six years ago. The last act of dispossessing African people of their
land occured as recently as 1984 when the Magopa community were removed
from their own land by the NP government. Happily, they returned to their
land in 1994 under the ANC government. However, the legacy still remains
with us.

We cannot blame everything on colonialism and I should not quote Pallo too
selectively. He goes on to say:


  Taming and reining in the rapacious indegenous elites that have plundered
  and continue to plunder the wealth of our continent is equally important.
  Stability and peace are pre-conditions for the regeneration of the
  African continent.

The Pan-African Parliament will be an organ of the African union. As our
Speaker said, the parliamentary voice has been absent, until now. The
decisions of the heads of states of Africa to establish a Pan-African
Parliament creates a new avenue for parliamentarians to make a positive
contribution towards the growth and development of the African continent,
towards the achievement of peace and stability, and towards acceptance of
democratic norms and principles.

Members of this Parliament under the leadership of our Speaker and the
Chairperson of the NCOP will participate in a meeting of African
parliamentarians which will be held in Pretoria next week, where the
protocol to establish the Pan-African Parliament will be finalised. The
deliberations of the ad hoc committee and the guidelines contained in the
table report will assist the South African delegation in their
participation in this meeting and in our attempts to enhance and strengthen
the protocol.

Important contributions and proposed amendments to the draft protocol
include the proposal that at least three women should be included among the
eight members from each member state. If this is accepted, it would send a
powerful signal to the whole world, and it would be a strong assertion and
recognition of the role of women in our continent. [Applause.]

We discussed the seat of this Parliament. Some members suggested Cape Town,
and some felt it should be Kimberley. But the consensus view was that the
assembly of heads of states of the African Union should determine the seat
of the Parliament. So, bad news for those from Kimberley, but there is
still a little bit of hope left. [Interjections.] ...

Mr J H MOMBERG: It should be Pofadder.

AN HON MEMBER: Welkom.

Mr D A HANEKOM: As the last minute elected chairperson of this ad hoc
committee, I would like to thank all committee members for their valuable
contributions to the deliberations of this committee. We were assisted by
the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Chairperson of the NCOP all of whom
understood the context and the issues pertinent to the establishment of the
Pan-African Parliament a lot better than the chair did.

The Minister was ever available to share her thoughts and views with us.
Her departmental officials as well as the law advisors of Parliament and
the Department of Justice put a lot of thought and hard work into the
comments and suggestions with which they provided us and they were useful.
But, ultimately, it is the work of the committee that will enable the South
African parliamentary delegation to go to the Pretoria meeting well
prepared.

In conclusion, I would like to quote another member of Parliament, the hon
Rev Zondi, also in the debate ``Making the 21st Century the African
Century''. He said:


  We welcome this debate as a small but important step in the long journey
  we have to traverse towards the realisation of our highly cherished goal
  of enabling Africa to take her rightful and dignified place among the
  continents of the world. The time has come for the continent of Africa,
  indeed the time has come for us in Africa, to begin to define that
  journey which we will all have to take towards making Africa a dignified
  place under the sun.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members, I thank the
committee and its chair for inviting me to participate in this debate.
Thanks to the technology I was able to participate in some of the
discussions through video conferencing even if I was not here physically.

I would just like to make a few comments regarding this Pan-African
Parliament and maybe make a few clarifications on what some of the speakers
have said. The movement for continental unity indeed began when those
eminent and distinguished Africans gathered in the epoch-making Pan-African
Congress in London in 1900. It did not start in Sert. Of course, the
leaders of our continent, including Léopold Sanghor, Ben Bella, Sékou
Touré, Kwame Nkrumah, Prixley Lka Seme, Langalibalele Dube, Oliver Tambo,
Nelson Mandela and a lot of our remarkable leaders, have all participated
in the pursuit for the noble objective articulated at that conference.

The seeds which were planted at the London Conference had germinated when
the African people refused to tolerate another day of the extension of
their misery, and removed power from the self-serving elite that remained
in the service of colonial masters. Central to all these struggles remained
the determination of the people of Africa for unity, solidarity and the
integration of the continent. Therefore, I would like to agree with members
that the Pan-African Parliament, in my view, is a necessary step, but I
think we should situate it in the formation of the African Union itself.
The African Union follows the formation of the Organisation of African
Unity, which was formed in 1963 and which has served us well up to now.

One of the speakers asked whether the OAU had done anything meaningful or
whether it should be disregarded because it had no meaningful role. We
should recall that the Organisation of African Unity over the years was
seized with the decolonialisation of the continent, and until South Africa
was decolonised and dealt with its colonialism of a special type, the OAU
could not spend a lot of energy on the development challenges of the
continent. It spent a lot of its energies discussing the liberation of the
African continent, stability, peace and security on the continent, and it
was only in 1991 when the Abuja Treaty was adopted that some meaningful
discussions took place around issues of economic development and the
challenge of development in Africa.

It was therefore an important step that, while we think the OAU has indeed
served us well in terms of the liberation of the African continent, our
leaders began to participate, not only on matters of security, peace and
political issues, but on economic issues as well. This is why the African
Union has been formed.  If one looks at it, it combines both what the OAU
was doing and what the Abuja Treaty is supposed to do. Of course, the Abuja
Treaty spells out a long process that would end up with an African
parliament not of this nature, but an African parliament of elected
continental parliamentarians, which is still a long way to come. This is an
interim step which will eventually lead to a properly elected parliament
that might have legislative powers.

So the reason for the formation of the African Union was the realisation
that Africa has to grapple with the developmental challenges of the 21st
century, and that the OAU, as it stands, is not able to deal with that
challenge properly. So it was important that a new organisation that would
be able to deal with that challenge properly be formed. Hence the formation
of the African Union.

Of course, the African Union has a number of bodies and the Pan-African
Parliament will be part of the bodies that would fit into the African
Union. Eventually, there would be a court and a monetary fund as well. So,
it is in that context that we should look at this Pan-African Parliament.
On the question asked by the hon Seremane whether the Pan-African
Parliament will coexist with the OAU it obviously shows that he has not
read the document, because if he had done so, he would not have asked that
question. The Pan-African Parliament would coexist with the African Union,
because once the African Union comes into being, the OAU will disappear.
So, if the hon member went and read the document, that will become very
apparent and clear. [Interjections.]

I would like to say that, as we debate this Pan-African Parliament, it is
very important that we do not behave like born-again democrats. We should
behave like proper democrats, because proper democrats would put their
points and debate it to try and convince other people to their point of
view. They will not try and lecture or dictate to other people.
[Interjections.] It is going to be very important that, even though we are
young in our experience of democracy, we must not show it. We must behave
like experienced democrats. [Interjections.]

Madam Speaker was very correct when she said that as we look at the Pan-
African Parliament, democracy, of course, is the foundation not only of the
Pan-African Parliament but also of the African Union itself. It is
important to stress what Madam Speaker said - that there is no ``one fits
all'' model of democracy.

Of course, democracy means people must have a say, there must be an
accountable government, and a responsible government which is elected at
regular intervals, but we cannot dictate the exact model, because the model
must take into account the realities that exist in each country. Each
country has its own faultlines and the democracy there has to make sure
that it addresses those instead of opening them up. Therefore, it cannot be
a case of ``one fits all.''

South African democracy is very good for South Africa, but may not
necessarily be good for the next country. In the same way, as we elected,
for instance, not to have constituencies because, for our purposes, that
did not work for us, in other countries, that may work for them. So, it is
very important that we bear that in mind.

In terms of economic development, yes, the leaders of the continent have
realised that it is important for them to participate and focus not only on
peace, security and stability, but also to look at economic development,
the fight against preventable diseases, ignorance, the fight against the
digital gap, and the fight against poverty. This is why we have the
formation of the African Union.
However, having said that, I think it is also important to look at what the
IFP member said. He asked some questions such as whether this will be a
useless talk shop that will be of ceremonial value and add no value to the
lives of people in the continent.

I think, indeed, that it would be up to the parliamentarians to ensure that
the Pan-African Parliament, even though it does not have legislative
powers, does add value because there are a lot of common issues which we
can discuss as a continent, and as parliamentarians from the continent.
There are lots of issues around which we would need to build consensus
which would assist both in African unity and in the understanding among our
peoples because, indeed, a lot of South Africans do not understand the
continent in which they live. They do not understand the people in the
continent and vice versa. It is important for parliamentarians to also
participate in feeding information, suggestions and recommendations to what
the OAU Heads of State are dealing with.

So, in my view, it would be in the hands of parliamentarians to make this a
meaningful parliament for the continent and a meaningful precursor for a
proper Pan-African Parliament which is envisaged in the Abuja Treaty.

I am not quite sure whether the hon member from the ACDP was saying that he
rejects this Pan-African Parliament idea, or what exactly he was saying. It
is not for the first time that I sometimes get confused by what he says
generally. [Laughter.] I would like to thank him if he does support the
idea of Pan-African Parliament because it is the right thing to do.
However, if he is opposed to it then we will pray for him, and he will
change his mind. [Laughter.] I just want to wish him well, and hope that
how he puts his ideas and how he convinces the rest of the continent we
will know after the 7th and 8th, because whatever comes out of that meeting
will reflect whether he was able to debate and convince other people or
not. If he is able to do that, then we will see a version of the Pan-
African Parliament that he is proposing, and if he is defeated we will soon
know. But I am sure that with all the powerful parliamentarians here he
will get a lot of his ideas across.

My only concern is that I heard the hon member saying that he thinks that
the Pan-African Parliament should have three women parliamentarians out of
a delegation of eight. Why should it not be four women parliamentarians out
of a delegation of eight? Why should it not be seven women parliamentarians
out of a delegation of eight? Why should it not be eight women
parliamentarians out of a delegation of eight? No, no, that would not be
right. Four women parliamentarians out of a delegation of eight should be
the minimum.

An HON MEMBER: Who is going to pay?

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I am quite sure that each country is going
to pay for its own parliamentarians in the same way that each country in
the OAU pays for its own delegation, and I think that is only fair.

I wish hon members luck. [Applause.]

         African Parliament, limited its discussions to issues of
         principle, and agreed on the following guidelines:


         (1)     The Pan-African Parliament should be a deliberative body,
              without any law-making powers.

         (2)     The Pan-African Parliament should be composed of eight
              members from each Member State, appointed by each national
              Parliament from its ranks, on the basis of broad
              representivity, with a minimum of three women members.

              views of their respective Parliaments.

         (4)     The term of each Pan-African parliamentarian should run
              with his or her term in the national Parliament concerned.


         (5)     Some general objectives of the Pan-African Parliament
              should be inserted in the draft Protocol.

         (6)     The seat of the Pan-African Parliament should be

              Vice-Presidents should be specifically stated in the Protocol.

         (9)     The Protocol should be reviewed at intervals of not less
              than five years.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and
     Technology on Indigenous Knowledge Systems, dated 19 September 2000:


     The Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology,
     having held public hearings on Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS),
     reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         1. The Committee held public hearings on a Bill on the protection
              and promotion of IKS (the Bill) from May to July 2000. The
              Bill, which emanated from the IKS Programme in 1998, under the
              Committee, is a private members' legislative proposal on the
              protection and promotion of IKS.

         2. Since 1998 the Committee has received many comments on the
              Bill, indicating that it was unsuitable for introduction in
              Parliament in its present form. Further research and review
              was necessary to address some of the concerns raised by the
              commentators. The purpose of the public hearings then was to
              obtain comments, submissions and recommendations from various
              stakeholders on contentious issues raised in respect of the
              Bill.

         3. This Report contains findings and recommendations, to be
              considered by the Committee for further consideration and
              comment. The findings and recommendations are based on
              comments and submissions received in response to the questions
              posed at the hearings. Paragraph B provides a summary of the
              Bill and the main concerns raised thereon. Paragraph C
              discusses the questions asked and paragraph D the answers
              thereto. Paragraph E deals with a proposed legislative
              framework for the protection of IKS, emergent issues arising
              from the hearings, and a conclusion.


     B.     Summary of Bill


         1. The Bill defines IKS as "productions consisting of
              characteristic elements of the traditional artistic heritage
              developed and maintained by a community in the country or by
              individuals reflecting the traditional artistic expectations
              of such a community" (clause 1(xv)).

         2. The Bill seeks to protect indigenous knowledge against "illicit
              use and exploitation" and other "prejudicial acts" (clause
              3(1)).

         3. Indigenous knowledge has been protected through the extension
              and application of the Intellectual Property Amendment Act,
              1997. Section 1(xiii) defines "Intellectual Property Right" as
              referring to Trade Marks, Copyright and Merchandise Marks. In
              order to give effect to this provision, the Minister of Trade
              and Industry is required, after the promulgation of the Bill
              into law, to review and amend all intellectual property laws
              to include indigenous knowledge.

         4. The Bill makes provision for the establishment of the following
              bodies:


              (1) A Regulatory Authority.

              (2) Collective Community Administration Agencies.

              (3) A Directorate of IKS.


         5. The Regulatory Authority is a national juristic body entrusted
              with the following functions:


              (1) Providing strategic policy direction on IKS, and the
                  implementation thereof.

              (2) Creating and promoting public awareness campaigns and mass
                  participation on IKS.
              (3) Implementation of the law on IKS and promotion of the IKS
                  programme.

              (4) Advising and co-ordinating all IKS activities, including
                  the activities of the Registrar of Patents, Designs,
                  Trade Marks and Copyright.

              (5) Conducting and co-ordinating research on the protection
                  and promotion of IKS.

              (6) Developing a directory of inventors.

              (7) Establishing a tariff of the fees payable for the use of
                  IKS technologies.


         6. The Bill makes provision for the creation of Centres of
              Excellence, whose main function is to act as Collective
              Community Administration Agencies. The Centres of Excellence -


              (1) are meant to defend the economic rights of community
                  members and mandators (clause 22(1));
              (2) require State authorisation to exercise all its
                  activities;

              (3) facilitate the process of licensing, collection and
                  distribution of fees payable for use of indigenous
                  knowledge entrusted to them; and

              (4) are accountable to traditional leaders, community members
                  and mandators.


         7. The Bill also makes provision for the creation of a Directorate
              of Indigenous Knowledge, which is to be headed by a Registrar.
              Its main functions are to -


              (1) ensure compliance with the Bill and the regulations issued
                  thereunder;

              (2) maintain registry of IKS, supervise, deposit and inspect
                  all indigenous knowledge held by the Directorate; and

              (3) manage the information centres and publish periodic
                  bulletins on IKS.


         8. Ownership disputes relating to indigenous knowledge are
              determined in accordance with traditional communities' own
              customs, laws and practices. The Bill lists a category of
              persons who may hold indigenous knowledge in custodianship:


              (1) The whole community.

              (2) A particular clan or family.

              (3) An association or society.

              (4) Specially taught or initiated individuals.


         9. Chapter III provides for the referral of disputes at the
              election of the regulatory authority to conciliation and
              subsequently to arbitration.

         10.     Clause 25 sets out the instances where the use of
              indigenous knowledge must be subject to authorisation:


              (1) Publication.

              (2) Reproduction.

              (3) Broadcasting.

              (4) Transmission in a diffusion service outside a lawful TV
                  broadcast and by a non-original broadcaster.

              (5) Adaptation for profitable purposes and outside its
                  traditional or customary context.


         11.     Failure to comply with the above is punishable on the
              first conviction with a fine equal to three times the value of
              the gain derived from use of the indigenous knowledge or to
              imprisonment not exceeding 20 years or to both such fine and
              imprisonment. A magistrate has the power to impose an
              additional penalty, which may exceed the jurisdiction of the
              Magistrate's Court. Any object made or receipts accruing to
              any person in contravention of the Bill are subject to seizure
              by an inspector appointed by the Authority.

         12.     Summary of main comments on Bill: Definition of IKS


              (1) The definition of IKS is set out in clause 1(xv). IKS is
                  defined as "social capital in the form of living skills
                  consisting of productions containing characteristic
                  elements of the traditional artistic heritage developed
                  and maintained by a community of South Africa or
                  individuals therein reflecting the traditional artistic
                  expectations of such a community, in particular". This
                  definition is partly derived from the definition of
                  "expression of folklore contained in section two of the
                  Model Provisions for the National Laws on the Protection
                  of Expressions of Folklore against Illicit Exploitation
                  and Other Prejudicial Actions (the Model Provisions)".
                  Section 2 of the Model Provisions defines "expressions of
                  folklore" as "productions consisting of characteristic
                  elements of the traditional artistic heritage developed
                  and maintained by a community or by individuals
                  reflecting the traditional artistic expectation of such a
                  community, in particular".

              (2) The commentary on the Model Provisions states that the
                  definition on artistic heritage is a particular domain
                  within the more extensive realm of cultural heritage.
                  Further, it states that the model provisions are intended
                  to center around the protection of traditional artistic
                  heritage rather than to extend to other forms of cultural
                  heritage.

              (3) Clause 1(xv)(e) and (f) seem to indicate that the
                  intention is not only to protect traditional artistic
                  heritage but also the following:


                  (a)  Manners and customs relating to food.

                  (b)  Clothing and housing.

                  (c)  Traditional medicine.

                  (d)  Fermentation techniques and technology.


              (4) Elsewhere the Bill provides that disagreement regarding
                  the protection of the environment is to be arbitrated in
                  terms of the Arbitration Act (clause 18(1)).

              (5) The comment raised, therefore, is that by defining IKS
                  using the Model Provisions definition may cause
                  uncertainty, given the narrowness of this definition and
                  the use of the phrase "in particular" in clause 1(xv)(e)
                  and (f) of the Bill, which may be interpreted to mean
                  that the list which follows after that phrase is a closed
                  list. Therefore, any aspect of IKS which has been
                  excluded from such a list is beyond the scope of the
                  Bill.

              (6) As a general comment, some Indigenous Communities in
                  Australia have taken exception to the use of the term
                  "folklore" to describe indigenous knowledge. The feeling
                  is that the term is too narrowly defined and implies an
                  inferiority of the cultural and intellectual property of
                  the indigenous peoples to the dominant culture. In using
                  the term "folklore" to describe IKS, the tendency has
                  been to reduce IKS to arts and crafts rather than a way
                  of life encompassing all aspects of cultural heritage,
                  including the indigenous knowledge of plants and animals
                  in medical treatment and as food.

              (7) Further, Mrs Erica Irene Daes, UN Special Rapporteur, on
                  her study on the protection of the cultural and
                  intellectual property of indigenous people, suggested
                  that any attempt "to try and subdivide the heritage of
                  indigenous people into separate legal categories such as
                  "cultural", "artistic" or intellectual elements such as
                  songs, stories, science or sacred sites would be
                  artificial". She believes that all elements of heritage
                  should be managed and protected as a single interrelated
                  and integrated whole. She furthermore states that
                  "heritage includes all expressions of the relationship
                  between the people, their land and other living beings
                  and spirits which share the land, and is the basis for
                  maintaining social, economic and diplomatic relationships
                  through sharing with other peoples. All of the aspects of
                  heritage are interrelated from the traditional territory
                  of the people concerned. What tangible and intangible
                  items constitute the heritage of a particular indigenous
                  people must be decided by the people themselves".


         13.     Exclusion of biodiversity from ambit of Bill


              (1) Commentators have raised concerns on the exclusion of
                  indigenous knowledge about biodiversity from the ambit of
                  the Bill. The exclusion of biodiversity could have been
                  an oversight, given the fact that the Bill in defining
                  indigenous knowledge includes "the production of
                  traditional medicine from herbs and other sources"
                  (clause 1(xv)(ee). Elsewhere, the Bill obliges the
                  Regulatory Authority to protect communities by requiring
                  researchers and scholarly institutions to obtain consent
                  prior to engaging in study of previously undescribed
                  species or cultivated varieties of plants, animals or
                  microbes or naturally occurring pharmaceuticals (clause
                  44).

              (2) Commentators believe that the Bill has not considered the
                  debates and contradictions that have arisen from the
                  Convention on Biological Diversity, to which South Africa
                  is a party. Briefly, the debate in the Convention forum
                  has two extreme positions. The first position advocates
                  the extension of intellectual property rights to
                  indigenous knowledge. The proponents of this position
                  argue that -


                  (a)  protecting indigenous knowledge through intellectual
                       property rights would promote technological
                       innovation and would facilitate the development and
                       dissemination of that knowledge in the modern
                       economic space; and

                  (b)  knowledge could generate incentives for indigenous
                       people to conserve the environment and manage
                       biodiversity.


              (3) The second position advocates the retention of the status
                  quo, where such knowledge is treated as a public good.
                  The proponents of this position argue that -


                  (a)  the extension of intellectual property rights to
                       indigenous knowledge would destroy the social basis
                       for generating and managing such knowledge; and

                  (b)  intellectual property extension to indigenous
                       knowledge would lead to the privatisation of such
                       knowledge, which may deny future generations and
                       industry access to such knowledge.


              (4) The Convention has been seen by developing countries as
                  "opening up opportunities for benefits to be derived from
                  their natural resources and providing a supportive
                  framework for protecting indigenous knowledge".

              (5) The primary objectives of the Convention are to ensure -


                  (a)  the equitable sharing of benefits derived from the
                       use of genetic resources with the parties providing
                       them;

                  (b)  that prior informed consent of indigenous people is
                       obtained before granting access to their knowledge
                       and natural resources;
                  (c)  that indigenous people receive recognition and
                       acknowledgement for their contribution to universal
                       knowledge and welfare;

                  (d)  that indigenous people develop their own economic
                       uses of their indigenous knowledge and associated
                       biological resources, which are consistent with
                       traditions of sustainable use; and

                  (e)  that the knowledge, innovations and practices of
                       indigenous people are respected and preserved through
                       the necessary legislation.


              (6) The Committee established from previous conferences and
                  meetings on IKS that there are five broad categories of
                  IKS, which should inform its definition. These broad five
                  categories, which have not been completely reflected in
                  the Bill's definition, are the following:


                  (a)  Technology.

                  (b)  Social issues and IKS.

                  (c)  Biodiversity.

                  (d)  Social institutions.

                  (e)  Liberatory processes.


              (7) Terminology employed in Bill


                  (a)  The Bill uses the terms "indigenous knowledge",
                       "traditional knowledge" and "cultural property"
                       interchangeably. The usage of these terms is often
                       subject to confusion, as there has been no unanimous
                       effort to develop a universally accepted definition
                       of IKS, traditional knowledge, indigenous people and
                       traditional people. Some commentators have asserted
                       that the diversity of the phrase "indigenous people"
                       renders problematic an all-embracing definition and
                       that attempts to develop an all-embracing definition
                       are a diversion of energies. However, we would
                       endorse the view expressed by Dr John Mugabe, (in his
                       "Intellectual Property Protection and Traditional
                       Knowledge" paper, delivered at a Conference on the
                       Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
                       and the Convention of Biological Diversity, Kenya,
                       February, 1999, p 98), that "whilst one may run into
                       conceptual difficulties in any attempt to define
                       indigenous knowledge and traditional knowledge, the
                       use of the two concepts as synonymous must be
                       eschewed".

                  (b)  The International Labour Organization (ILO) defines
                       indigenous people as "People who have descended from
                       populations who inhabited a country or geographical
                       region thereof at the time of conquest, or
                       colonization or establishment of state boundaries and
                       who irrespective of their legal status retain some or
                       all of their own social economic cultural and
                       political institutions".


              (8) Definition has four vital factors


                  (a)  Priority in time with respect to occupation of a
                       territory.

                  (b)  Voluntary perpetuation of cultural distinctiveness.

                  (c)  Self-identification and self-recognition by other
                       groups.

                  (d)  An experience of subjugation, marginalisation,
                       dispossession, exclusion or discrimination,
                       irrespective of whether or not these conditions
                       persist (Dr Erica-Martin Daes, "Rights of Indigenous
                       People", paper presented at Pacific Workshop on the
                       UN Draft declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
                       Peoples, Suva, Fiji, September 1996).


              (9) At this stage, we can therefore state that indigenous
                  knowledge is that continuous knowledge regarding all
                  aspects of indigenous cultural knowledge that is
                  acquired, nurtured, evolved and transmitted from
                  generation to generation by indigenous people, whether
                  collectively or as individuals, and which sustains the
                  lives of and regulates the relationships of indigenous
                  people amongst themselves and with the environment in
                  which they live.


         14.     Traditional people


              (1) Members of a distinct culture, who hold an unwritten body
                  of long-standing customs, beliefs, rituals and practices
                  handed down from previous generations.

              (2) No claim of prior territorial occupancy to the current
                  habitat - they could be recent immigrants.

              (3) Indigenous people are traditional, but traditional people
                  are not necessarily indigenous ("Intellectual Property
                  Protection and Traditional Knowledge" paper, delivered at
                  a Conference on the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual
                  Property Rights and the Convention of Biological
                  Diversity, Kenya, February 1999, p 98).


         15.     Acts against which IKS would be protected


              (1) This aspect is dealt with by clauses 1(xvi), 3(1), 20 and
                  25.

              (2) Clause 3(1) states that "indigenous knowledge shall be
                  protected against illicit use and exploitation and other
                  prejudicial actions as defined in this Act". It is not
                  entirely clear what would constitute "illicit use and
                  exploitation" or "prejudicial action". Clause 1(xvi)
                  defines illicit use as "any utilization in violation of
                  the provisions (unless it is within the scope of the
                  exceptions mentioned would be illicit exploitation).
                  Similarly, non-compliance with the provisions and
                  commissions of the acts described would constitute other
                  prejudicial actions, which are illicit, even if they
                  occur in connection with an authorized utilization that
                  does not require authorization". Most commentators have
                  suggested that this definition requires further
                  clarification. The notions of "illicit exploitations" and
                  "prejudicial actions" have been derived from section 1 of
                  the Model Provisions. In terms of the commentary to the
                  model provisions, any utilisation of folklore for gainful
                  intent outside its traditional or customary context and
                  without authorisation from a competent authority or the
                  community itself constitutes illicit exploitation. This
                  means, amongst other things, that use, even with gainful
                  intent within the traditional or customary context, would
                  not be subject to authorisation. Conversely, use by
                  members of the community where the indigenous knowledge
                  has been developed and maintained, would require
                  authorisation if it were made outside that context and
                  with gainful intent.

              (3) One can thus deduce that what was intended in the Bill is
                  that any use of indigenous knowledge in violation of
                  clause 25 would constitute illicit exploitation.
                  Similarly, the violation of clause 20 and the commission
                  of an offence in terms of clause 37 would constitute
                  prejudicial actions.

              (4) Clause 37 only makes the violation of clause 20 an
                  offence. It does not seem that the violation of clause 25
                  would constitute an offence. It would seem that this
                  might not have been the intention of the legislature.


         16.     Beneficiaries of protection
              (1) Clause 24 identifies beneficiaries of IKS as -


                  (a)  a whole community;

                  (b)  a particular family or clan;

                  (c)  an association or society; and

                  (d)  individuals who have been specially taught or
                       initiated to be its custodians.


              (2) This clause further provides that the owners of indigenous
                  knowledge will be determined in accordance with the
                  communities' own customary law practices. By implication,
                  the Bill proposes that ownership disputes should be
                  determined in accordance with the communities' own
                  customary law and practices.

              (3) Clause 22 makes provision for the establishment of
                  Collective Administration Organisations through Centres
                  of Excellence. The latter, although not defined as such,
                  are the nine historically black universities. Generally,
                  Collective Administration Organisations are normally
                  established in terms of copyright laws of a country. In
                  as much as these are well established in European
                  countries, the South African Copyright Act has no
                  equivalent provision for their establishment. The main
                  function of such an organisation is to license the use of
                  copyright works for an agreed fee and to collect and
                  distribute the fees to composers and authors.

              (4) Under a Collective Administration System, owners of
                  indigenous works would authorise such an organisation to
                  administer its works by, inter alia -


                  (a)  processing applications for use of indigenous works;

                  (b)  granting authorisation for certain kinds of use of
                       indigenous works;

                  (c)  monitoring the use of such works;

                  (d)  negotiating on behalf of indigenous owners with
                       prospective users the terms of use and licensing of
                       such works;

                  (e)  licensing against appropriate fees and conditions;
                       and

                  (f)  collecting such fees and distributing them to the
                       indigenous owners.


              (5) The provision for Centres of Excellence is a very positive
                  element, as they would develop a distinct profile
                  ensuring a continued regard and respect for Indigenous
                  works. It would be advisable to further clarify the
                  following:


                  (a)  What constitutes such a Centre?

                  (b)  The precise functions of these Centres. Generally,
                       Collecting Organisations operate under stringent
                       conditions, which include the holding of monies
                       collected in trust for owners and access to records
                       by owners. They are required to keep proper
                       independently audited records. The only functions
                       mentioned are -


                       (i)   that they will defend economic rights of the
                             community;

                       (ii)  that they will grant non-exclusive licenses for
                             use of works;

                       (iii) that they will negotiate general tariffs and
                             distribute fees to members; and

                       (iv)  how they will be funded.


              (6) Generally, Collective Administration Organisations often
                  require many resources. Infrastructure would include
                  specialised legal, accounting and information technology
                  expertise. In addition, there are substantial costs
                  associated with data collection and research.


         17.     Manner in which intellectual property rights have been
              extended to IKS


              (1) Intellectual property is the expression used to describe
                  the rights afforded by law in respect of -


                  (a)  patents for inventions;

                  (b)  copyright for creation of new knowledge and
                       expression;

                  (c)  registered designs for new shapes or appearance of
                       an article;

                  (d)  trade marks and geographical indications for
                       distinctive goods or services;

                  (e)  plant breeders' rights for propagation of new plant
                       varieties;

                  (f)  unlawful competition for prevention of gaining an
                       advantage over a competitor in an unfair or unlawful
                       manner; and

                  (g)  trade secrets.


              (2) Intellectual property, therefore, covers all forms of
                  proprietary rights whereby a person or company can
                  prevent third parties from conduct which would give them
                  an unfair advantage.

              (3) Clause 1(xiii) defines intellectual property rights only
                  with reference to the -


                  (a)  Trade Marks Act, 1993;

                  (b)  Copyright Act, 1978; and
                  (c)  Merchandise Act, 1941,


                  and not with reference to other forms of intellectual
                  property rights (IPR) specifically referred to in
                  paragraph 15(2) above.


              (4) The exclusion of the other forms of IPRs means that
                  indigenous knowledge in the medicinal, agricultural and
                  technological fields might not be protected. The
                  definition of IPRs has been derived from section 1(1)(xi)
                  of the Counterfeit Goods Act, 1997. The latter does not
                  protect other registered forms of IPRs, such as patents
                  or designs, nor does it protects unfair competition
                  rights. Some commentators have indicated that the
                  reference to trade marks, copyright and merchandise marks
                  means that the Bill only covers "artistic" indigenous
                  knowledge. This might not have been the intention, given
                  the fact that the definition of indigenous knowledge
                  covers other aspects of IKS, such as -


                  (a)  manners and customs relating to food;

                  (b)  clothing and housing;

                  (c)  traditional medicine; and

                  (d)  fermentation techniques and technology,


                  and the fact that clause 3(2) provides that "this Act
                  shall apply to every intellectual property right
                  incorporated under the Intellectual Property Laws Act,
                  save as otherwise provided herein, to every intellectual
                  property right".


         18.     The clauses dealing with IPRs have received great
              attention from commentators. Most have indicated that because
              South Africa is a party to international instruments
              regulating IPRs, her intellectual property (IP) laws must
              reflect international minimum norms contained in such
              instruments. Indigenous knowledge, therefore, cannot be
              protected in terms of the existing IP laws unless the latter
              are amended to provide for its protection. Other commentators
              have gone so far as to indicate that if indigenous knowledge
              is protected by marrying it in any way at all with existing
              IPRs, this would have international negative repercussions for
              South Africa's international trade, and hence the economy.
              These commentators argue that the Bill in its present form
              violates the provisions of the World Trade Organization's
              (WTO) agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual
              Property (TRIPS). The following provision is quoted in
              particular: The equality of treatment principle set out in
              article 3 of TRIPS, which provides that "each member shall
              accord to the nationals of other members treatment no less
              favourable than it accords its own nationals". This means that
              people within the RSA have to be treated in IPRs in the same
              manner as people outside the RSA who are applying for such
              rights or who have rights in the RSA to be protected.


              (1) The question of extending IPRs to indigenous knowledge is
                  a complex one and often fraught with controversy. The
                  international community has recognised the need to devise
                  new regimes or expand existing ones to accommodate IKS.
                  However, no coherent and inclusive international efforts
                  are made to address these concerns. Some commentators
                  believe that the existing IPR systems are inadequate to
                  protect IKS because -


                  (a)  IPRs are oriented around the concept of private
                       ownership and individual invention, whereas IKS
                       emphasise collective creation and ownership of
                       knowledge; and

                  (b)  IPRs violate indigenous cultural principles by
                       encouraging the commodification of such knowledge.


                  These commentators advocate the enactment of sui generis
                  regimes for the protection of IKS.


              (2) Other commentators argue that the above concerns show a
                  lack of understanding of the specifics of IP law and the
                  specifics of concrete uses of indigenous knowledge.
                  Whilst many indigenous cultures develop and transmit
                  knowledge from generation to generation within a communal
                  system, individuals in indigenous communities can
                  distinguish themselves as informal creators or inventors
                  separate from the community (Prof Gupta, 1992). These
                  commentators argue that geographical indications, trade
                  marks and trade secrets can be used to protect indigenous
                  knowledge. Studies have shown that indigenous people have
                  used, and continue to use, trade secrets to protect their
                  knowledge. Geographical indications and trade marks are
                  intended not to reward innovation, but goodwill and
                  reputation created or built up by a group of producers
                  for many years. Geographical indications can create
                  economical rewards for producers who use indigenous
                  methods in the region where the product is produced.

              (3) From the above it seems that "the present IP system
                  presents both opportunities and obstacles for protecting
                  indigenous knowledge. The relationship between measures
                  to protect indigenous knowledge and the IP system
                  requires further consideration....., the co-existence
                  between the IP system and the protection of indigenous
                  knowledge is a profound and complex question" (WIPO).


         19.     Retroactivity


              (1) Clause 43 provides for some form of retroactivity. It
                  provides that "any utilization (of indigenous knowledge)
                  which became subject to the law (IKS) but were commenced
                  without authorization before the date of commencement of
                  this Act should within six months after that date and
                  subject to the rules of the Regulatory Authority relating
                  to the issue of the authorization, apply for such
                  authorization".

              (2) Commentators have questioned whether this provision is
                  legal, given the fact that some indigenous knowledge-
                  based innovation and creation are protected in terms of
                  the existing IP legislation. They have argued that the
                  effect of this provision is intended to invalidate prior
                  registered patents based on indigenous knowledge and
                  genetic resources. The other concerns are:


                  (a)  How far back would the retroactivity apply.

                  (b)  Who will perform the identification process of
                       utilisation, which would in terms of the IKS law
                       require authorisation, and how long would such a
                       process take place.


              (3) WIPO has suggested that the effect of this provision on
                  existing IP rights in respect of indigenous knowledge-
                  based innovations and creation requires further
                  consideration.


         20.     Implementing structures


              As previously mentioned, the Bill makes provision for the
              establishment of a Regulatory Authority and a Directorate.
              Most commentators felt that the functions of these two bodies
              could be combined to avoid unnecessarily increasing the number
              of people to administer the act. Other commentators remarked
              that "far from recognizing indigenous community rights, the
              state seems to be eager to get full control over their
              knowledge, information and natural resources" (Grace Noguiera,
              Brazilian lawyer). This brings into question the level of
              involvement of holders of indigenous knowledge in the
              implementation of the Bill. However, commentators acknowledge
              that the identification of holders of indigenous knowledge is
              a difficult task.
         21.     Various other comments relating to the format of the Bill
              were raised, but we believe the above comments represent the
              essence of the main comments. In the light of the comments
              raised, the Committee called for public hearings in all nine
              provinces. In preparation for these hearings, questions were
              prepared and circulated. The purpose of these was to assist
              the Committee to address the concerns/comments raised and to
              obtain the views of indigenous people/practitioners on how to
              deal with the contentious issues.

              (2) If so, how should this fact-finding mission be
                  constituted, and what other issues should it cover?


     D.     Answers


         1. Understanding of IKS


              (1) IKS was seen as a way of life which has social
                  consciousness implications and has sustained indigenous
                  people from generation to generation.

              (2) Participants considered and debated the efficacy of the
                  five broad categories of IKS. The general feeling was
                  that IKS is very broad and covers all aspects of the
                  lives of indigenous people, including interaction amongst
                  themselves and with the environment in which they live.
                  Others felt that a further category of economic issues
                  could be introduced but for purposes of drafting a
                  definition of IKS, these five categories were sufficient.

              (3) The participants were also of the view that the definition
                  of IKS was too narrow and couched in folklore terms. The
                  definition must be amended to reflect all aspects of
                  cultural heritage, including the indigenous knowledge of
                  plants and animals as food and in medical treatment.


         2. Language


              In all nine provinces, participants were of the view that
              language is an important manifestation of indigenous
              knowledge. It conveys cultural heritage and philosophical
              tenets of indigenous people (for example, the saying that
              "umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu" conveys the philosophy of "ubuntu",
              which other countries are now researching for implementation
              in organisational design). Through this saying, children were
              taught the importance of being part of a collective/team and
              of sacrificing personal needs in the interest of the common
              good of the collective. This in turn fostered respect for
              other people in the collective and assisted in conflict
              management resolution within the collective. Participants
              raised the concern that indigenous languages are often
              researched by non-indigenous people, who then produce books
              and sell them to indigenous people. In most instances, these
              books incorrectly reflect indigenous languages. Traditional
              leaders in the Northern Cape were of the view that the Khoisan
              languages are inextricably linked to the land and the people.


         3. Cultural heritage/social issues


              Indigenous knowledge includes culture, spiritual knowledge,
              histories, oral tradition, teaching and learning systems,
              indigenous ceremonies, literary, performing and artistic
              works, which includes music, dance, songs and praise poetry.


         4. Institutions


              Participants regarded indigenous institutions, such as
              initiation ceremonies, traditional leadership, traditional
              healing, lobola and lekgotla, important in any definition of
              IKS.


         5. Indigenous technologies


              (1) Food management and preservation systems.

              (2) Seeds preservation and management systems.

              (3) Indigenous farming and agricultural techniques. The
                  general feeling was that an effort must be made at
                  government level to support indigenous farmers in this
                  regard, especially in view of the controversy which has
                  arisen with respect to genetically modified food.

              (4) Indigenous mining techniques.


         6. Biodiversity


              (1) Knowledge of and sustainable use of flora and fauna as
                  food and for medical treatment.

              (2) General ecological knowledge.

              (3) Indigenous human genetic material, including DNA and
                  tissues.


         7. Liberatory processes


              (1) This category was debated at length, and the general
                  feeling was that further research should be conducted
                  thereon. It was acknowledged that conflict resolution
                  methods adopted in institutions such as "lekgotla"
                  represent indigenous wisdom. The talks at Codesa on the
                  freedom of this country were structured on the principles
                  of "lekgotla". The basic premise of "lekgotla" is that
                  parties to a dispute must seek to obtain co-operation and
                  consensus on the end result. This is in stark contrast
                  with the western adversarial system applied in our
                  courts, which is characterised by antagonism and conflict
                  between parties. It was noted that the invitation
                  extended to Mr Cyril Ramaphosa to mediate in the Ireland
                  dispute was recognition of the strength of "lekgotla"
                  principles in conflict resolution and management.

              (2) The concept of "ubuntu" was also discussed at length. It
                  was recommended that further research be done thereon,
                  particularly in view of the fact that institutions such
                  as Harvard had begun to conduct research in this regard.


         8. Suggested definition of indigenous knowledge


              (1) The following is a suggested draft definition of
                  indigenous knowledge, based on the findings and
                  consultations at the hearings:


                  Indigenous knowledge is that continuous living knowledge
                  that is acquired, nurtured, evolved and transmitted from
                  generation to generation by indigenous people, whether
                  collectively or as individuals, as part of expressing all
                  aspects of their indigenous cultural heritage and
                  concerning without limitation:


                  (a)  Indigenous cultural identity - spiritual knowledge,
                       histories, oral tradition, teaching and learning
                       systems, indigenous ceremonies, literary, performing
                       and artistic works, which includes music, dance,
                       songs and praise poetry.

                  (b)  Indigenous institutions - initiation ceremonies,
                       traditional leadership, traditional healing and
                       "lekgotla".

                  (c)  Indigenous technologies - food management and
                       preservation systems, etc.

                  (d)  Biodiversity - knowledge of and sustainable use of
                       flora and fauna as food and for medical treatment,
                       etc.

                  (e)  Indigenous conflict resolution and management
                       systems - "lekgotla", which regulates the
                       relationships of indigenous peoples amongst
                       themselves and with the environment in which they
                       live.


         9. Definition of indigenous people
              It was suggested that the Bill should contain a definition of
              indigenous people. The current draft does not have this
              definition.


         10.     Protection, preservation and promotion


              Should Parliament pass legislation for the protection,
              preservation and promotion of IKS?


              (1) This was asked in view of the two extreme positions on
                  protection of IKS within the Convenrtion forum, referred
                  to in paragraph B.12(4) above.

              (2) Participants acknowledged that the purpose of IPR is to
                  turn knowledge into a marketable commodity. This means
                  that knowledge must be separated and isolated into
                  identifiable pieces, which can be protected by law. IKS,
                  on the other hand, is integrative, holistic and
                  synergistic. However, the reality of the situation is
                  that indigenous knowledge is being misappropriated
                  without reward or recognition of its holders. Overall, a
                  significant aspect of the global economy is based on the
                  appropriation and use of indigenous knowledge to the
                  extent that trade in medicinal plants from developing
                  countries runs into billions of rands. The participants
                  felt that, in view of these developments, indigenous
                  knowledge must be protected and just compensation for the
                  use of such knowledge must be guaranteed.

              (3) Participants felt that the constitutional guarantees
                  extended to customary law should likewise be extended to
                  IKS.


         11.     How should legislation deal with secrecy and sacredness
              aspect of IKS?


              (1) The participants felt that secret and sacred matter must
                  be dealt with in accordance with the customary rules of
                  indigenous people. A concern was raised, however, about
                  the unauthorised use and reproduction of secret and
                  sacred material for commercial purposes. This has led to
                  the disclosure of secret and sacred material to parties
                  who are not entitled to know or view such material. It is
                  now common course to watch male initiation ceremonies on
                  television. The fact that this institution was
                  experiencing problems and challenges, did not justify the
                  violation of its secrecy and sacredness. These challenges
                  and problems must be solved within an indigenous context.

              (2) Other participants felt that, with the exception of
                  traditional healing and spiritual matters, indigenous
                  people should evaluate whether it would still be
                  necessary to retain secrecy and sacredness after
                  legislation on IKS has been passed. These participants
                  argued that the reason why indigenous people originally
                  introduced secrecy and sacredness, was to protect
                  indigenous knowledge from misappropriation and scrutiny
                  by missionaries. They further argued that if secret and
                  sacred material is maintained as such in perpetuity, it
                  might deprive indigenous communities from evaluating the
                  efficacy and relevance of such material. The only
                  requirement is that indigenous people must do the
                  evaluation themselves in accordance with customary
                  practices within an indigenous context.

              (3) The participants also felt that secret and sacred material
                  of traditional healers or material relating to spiritual
                  matters must be maintained as such and in accordance with
                  the customary practices of indigenous people. The only
                  requirement is that the retention of secrecy and
                  sacredness for traditional healing must be coupled with
                  responsibility and accountability.


         12.     What are our concerns on IKS and how do we want these
              concerns addressed in legislation on IKS?


              The participants raised the following concerns:


              (1) The legal status of IKS. The feeling was that the process
                  of enacting legislation for the protection and promotion
                  of IKS must be expedited.

              (2) Unauthorised use of secret and sacred material.

              (3) Unauthorised use of indigenous knowledge without benefit
                  sharing or recognition of holders/creators of that
                  knowledge.

              (4) The patenting by pharmaceuticals of plants which have been
                  identified by indigenous people as having healing
                  properties. Pharmaceuticals thereafter isolate the active
                  ingredient of the plants and patent inventions on those
                  plants even though their healing properties have been
                  known to indigenous people for years.

              (5) The retention by universities and museums of art, stone
                  implements and carvings without prior informed consent.

              (6) Misinformation in research. A lot of research has been
                  conducted on indigenous people, their languages and
                  institutions. Indigenous people have not been consulted
                  on how the material is to be represented and
                  disseminated.

              (7) Exclusion of indigenous knowledge from schools' and
                  universities' curricula.

              (8) A lack of cohesive organisation, representing the
                  interests of indigenous people and the difficulty of
                  accessing indigenous people.

              (9) No educational campaign or awareness programmes on IKS.

              (10)The above concerns must be addressed by -


                  (a)  finalising legislation on IKS;

                  (b)  legislation protecting the rights of ownership and
                       control of indigenous knowledge by indigenous people;
                       and

                  (c)  legislation making provision for a structure through
                       which indigenous people can organise themselves and
                       form local and international networks.


         13.     What rights of indigenous people do we want most protected
              in IKS legislation?


              The participants listed the following rights:


              (1) The right of ownership and control of indigenous
                  knowledge.

              (2) The right to benefit commercially from the authorised
                  exploitation of indigenous knowledge.

              (3) The right to ensure that any means of protecting IKS is
                  premised on the principle of self-determination, which
                  includes the right of indigenous people to maintain and
                  develop their own culture and knowledge systems and forms
                  of social organisation.

              (4) The right to authorise or refuse to authorise the
                  commercial use of IKS in accordance with indigenous
                  customary law.

              (5) The right to maintain the secrecy and sacredness of IKS.

              (6) The right to prevent distortions and mutilations of IKS.

              (7) The right to legal assistance and support on IKS contracts
                  and any unauthorised use of indigenous knowledge.


         14.     How should IPRs be extended to IKS?


              (1) Participants acknowledged that this topic was complex, and
                  required further debate and investigation, given the fact
                  that there was absence of consensus on whether and how to
                  extend IP protection to IKS. The debate at international
                  level has shown that the extension of IP protection to
                  IKS is complex and controversial. Some participants felt
                  the manner in which the Bill had extended IPR to
                  indigenous knowledge might be in contravention of the
                  provisions of TRIPS. It was suggested that this aspect
                  should be investigated further.

              (2) The question here is whether legal protection of IKS can
                  be achieved within the existing IP system or whether sui
                  generis regimes should be enacted to offer legal
                  protection to IKS. Most participants were of the view
                  that although the existing IP system does not offer
                  protection to most of the indigenous-based innovations
                  and technologies, certain aspects of IP can be used to
                  protect IKS:


                  (a)  Certification and Collective Marks.

                  (b)  Trade Secrets.

                  (c)  Geographical indications.
         15.     Participants felt that the debate on IP protection of
              indigenous knowledge has tended to focus on the restrictive
              nature of patents' and plant breeders' rights, which have the
              following requirement for inventions to be patentable:


              (1) It must be new.

              (2) It must involve an inventive step.

              (3) It must be capable of industrial and agricultural
                  application.


         16.     Participants stated that indigenous people have used and
              continue to use trade secrets to protect indigenous knowledge.
              The advantage of trade secrets is that they can be used to
              protect subject matter which is unpatentable or because the
              holder thereof does not wish to disclose publicly for fear
              that a business competitor will use the information to the
              holder's disadvantage. Once the information is publicly
              disclosed, the holder can no longer claim the information
              secret. Certain aspects of indigenous knowledge relating to
              traditional healing and medicinal knowledge can be protected
              through trade secrets. The Bill should provide for the
              protection of indigenous knowledge through trade secrets.


              (1) Geographical indications and collective marks were seen as
                  useful tools for indigenous people seeking to obtain
                  economic benefits from their indigenous knowledge or
                  prevent its objectionable commercial use by third
                  parties. Geographical indications are defined under TRIPS
                  as indications which identify goods as originating in the
                  territory of a (WTO) member or region or locality in that
                  territory where a given quality, reputation or
                  characteristic is attributable to its geographic origin.

              (2) In South Africa, geographical indications, certification
                  and collective marks are governed by sections 42 and 43,
                  respectively, of the Trade Marks Act. A certification
                  mark is defined as a mark capable of distinguishing in
                  the course of trade, goods or services certified by any
                  person in respect of quality, kind, quantity, intended
                  purpose, value, geographical origin or other
                  characteristics of the goods or services, as the case may
                  be, from goods not so certified. A collective trade mark
                  is a mark capable of distinguishing in the course of
                  trade goods or services of persons who are members of any
                  association from goods or services of persons who are not
                  members thereof. The main difference between collective
                  and certification marks is that the former can only be
                  used by the association which owns the mark, while the
                  latter may be used by anybody who complies with the
                  defined standards as to quality, value, etc. An important
                  requirement is that the person or entity applying for the
                  certification mark is competent to certify the goods or
                  services concerned. With reference to IKS, indigenous
                  associations or persons could certify products as being
                  of a particular quality, mode or character and emanating
                  from a certain region.

              (3) Geographical indications and collective and certification
                  marks have the following advantages for indigenous
                  knowledge:


                  (a)  They are based on collective traditions and a
                       collective decision-making process, a producer being
                       qualified to use a geographical indication according
                       to her location and methods of production. It is
                       irrelevant whether the producer is an individual,
                       family member, in partnership or in association. For
                       example, Ndebele beads manufacturers and
                       craftspersons could register a collective association
                       and distinguish themselves in the market place.

                  (b)  They confer monopoly rights over the use of certain
                       information, but simply limit the class of people who
                       can use a certain symbol.

                  (c)  They protect and reward traditions while allowing
                       evolution.

                  (d)  They emphasise the relationships between human
                       cultures and their local land and environment.

                  (e)  They are not freely transferable from one owner to
                       another.

                  (f)  They can be maintained in perpetuity (CIEL
                       discussion paper for Convention workshop, November
                       1997).


         17.     A submission was made to the effect that the Registrar of
              Patents, Designs and Trade Marks should investigate the
              possibility of creating a register of well-known marks of IKS.
              A mark is well known in the Republic if it is known to a
              substantial number of persons interested in the goods or
              services to which the mark relates (e.g. McDonald's). The
              effect of this register would grant the right to indigenous
              persons to exclude others from using these marks.

         18.     Finally, it was suggested that it is important to
              establish mechanisms to ensure that, once the IKS legislation
              has been enacted, inventions based on IKS and genetic
              resources are not filed and protected in terms of IP laws
              without authorisation from the holders thereof.

         19.     Traditional leaders and IKS


              How should we organise ourselves as indigenous people to take
              control and ownership of IKS and to maximise benefit-sharing
              on the use of IKS?

              Participants supported the establishment of the Regulatory
              Authority. This Regulatory Authority must be a national body
              tasked with the determination and implementation of strategic
              policy on IKS. The participation and election of indigenous
              people in the Regulatory Authority was seen as essential. The
              participants were of the view that the establishment of a
              Directorate of IKS in the Bill would constitute duplication.
              The Regulatory Authority could do the work of the Directorate.
              At provincial level, it was recommended that trusts (nine)
              should be established to represent the interests of indigenous
              people. Trustees of the trust would be appointed on the
              recommendation and approval of indigenous people at local
              level. There would be no formal legal structure at local level
              other than indigenous people being encouraged to form local
              committees, which would interact with local universities and
              other institutions. The following structure was proposed and
              approved:


                    NATIONAL BODY
                    REGULATORY AUTHORITY
                    PROVINCIAL STRUCTURE
                    TRUSTS (NINE TRUSTS)
                    TRADITIONAL LEADERS
                    LOCAL COMMUNITIES/COMMITTEES
                    THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT
                    UNIVERSITIES/COLLEGES OF EDUCATION
                    IKS & SOCIAL ISSUES
                    IKS & SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS
                    BIODIVERSITY
                    TECHNOLOGY
                    LIBERATORY
                    PROCESSES


         20.     A representative from the National Heritage Body in the
              Eastern Cape suggested that national heritage as an existing
              structure could be used for the IKS structure at provincial
              level.

         21.     Should a register of IKS be created, if so, by whom, and
              how must it be designed?


              (1) The participants welcomed the directory of inventors
                  envisaged in the Bill. The concern at this stage was that
                  it would be dangerous for holders of indigenous knowledge
                  to disclose their knowledge without safety mechanisms
                  being put in place. It was still necessary to control
                  access to knowledge.

              (2) It was recommended that an interim measure would be to
                  register all holders of IKS, including their speciality
                  area, without disclosing the details of knowledge. The
                  interim register would simply provide contact details of
                  indigenous knowledge holders. The disclosure of knowledge
                  would only be done on enactment of legislation on IKS and
                  subject to the condition that -


                  (a)  the register should not stifle the development of
                       IKS;

                  (b)  inclusion of knowledge in the register should be
                       voluntary; and

                  (c)  new material and secret and sacred knowledge would
                       require further protection.


         22.     How should ownership disputes on IKS be settled?


              (1) The participants saw the issue here as how to identify
                  rightful owners of IKS and how to deal with competing
                  claims of ownership and how to deal with IKS that is
                  similar across boundaries and populations.

              (2) The participants supported the dispute resolution
                  mechanisms set out in the Bill:


                  (a)  Through customary law and practice.

                  (b)  Conciliation and arbitration.

                  (c)  The importance of having an informal dispute
                       resolution system was stressed, as it would then be
                       accessible to indigenous people. The Bill does not
                       provide for a court of competent jurisdiction on IKS
                       matters. It was also felt that courts should be used
                       as a last resort.

                  (d)  With reference to IKS that cuts across boundaries,
                       it was felt that ownership rights of all concerned
                       must be respected, subject to joint benefit-sharing.
                       Collecting agencies would assist in this regard.


         23.     Traditional leaders and IKS


              (1) Do we believe traditional leaders have a role to play in
                  IKS? If so, what is the nature and extent of this role?


                  (a)  The feeling was that traditional leaders have an
                       important role to play in IKS, as they are an
                       important source of IKS - they are custodians of IKS.
                       Traditional leaders should play an important part in
                       the administration structures of IKS.

                  (b)  Traditional leaders from Mpumalanga proposed that,
                       if given resources, they could initiate projects of
                       an indigenous nature, such as -


                       (i)   cultivation, manufacturing and distribution of
                             sorghum beer;

                       (ii)  indigenous fermentation and manufacturing of
                             mageu;

                       (iii) catching of and processing of Mopani worms.


              (2) What should be the nature of the relationship between
                  traditional leadership, indigenous communities and
                  Parliament?


                  (a)  Traditional leaders could act as a link between
                       indigenous communities and Parliament. However, it
                       was stressed that the political neutrality of
                       traditional leaders is important in this regard. Some
                       traditional leaders have entered politics, with the
                       result that it might be difficult to represent
                       indigenous people of different political
                       affiliations.

                  (b)  It was recommended that the Committee have further
                       discussions with the House of Traditional Leaders on
                       the exact role of traditional leaders in IKS.


              (3) Traditional healers and IKS


                  Do we believe that traditional healers have a moral duty
                  to explain the difference between traditional doctors and
                  traditional witchcraft?


                  (a)  The practitioners could not reach consensus on
                       terminology to be used in describing traditional
                       healers. Some felt that the latter term inadequately
                       reflected them as doctors in the traditional context.
                       Others felt that the term "traditional healers" was
                       sufficiently broad to encapsulate all aspects of
                       traditional healing, including -


                       (i)   prophets/diviners;

                       (ii)  herbalists;

                       (iii) traditional healers; and

                       (iv)  sangomas.


         24.     They also felt that the use of the term "traditional
              doctor" could confuse members of the public into believing
              that they were in some way linked to "witchdoctors".


              (1) Other practitioners felt that the appropriate term to be
                  used in describing their office should be "traditional
                  health care practitioners".

              (2) Traditional healing was recognised as permeating all
                  aspects of indigenous life. Traditional healers play a
                  very important role in health care, counselling,
                  spiritual healing and African traditional religion. The
                  term "witchdoctor" was coined by the previous
                  legislature, which did not appreciate the nature of the
                  social role played by traditional healers. The
                  Suppression of Witchcraft Act regulates matters connected
                  with witchcraft. This Act insufficiently distinguishes
                  between witchdoctors, witch finders and traditional
                  healers. In fact, the Act does not define the terms
                  "witchdoctors" and "witch finders". This Act also makes
                  the consultation of a witchdoctor (traditional healer) to
                  establish that a third party is a witch, an offence.
                  Practitioners raised the concern that this provision does
                  not appreciate the holistic nature of their practice.
                  Often, their patients consult them for health reasons,
                  and during the consultation and diagnosis, it transpires
                  that there is involvement of evil forces. It is then
                  their duty to protect their patient in this regard. The
                  manner applied for protection purposes then distinguishes
                  witches from healers. Witches intentionally harm and kill
                  people or cause harm or death to people. Healers heal by
                  protecting people from harm and death through the spirit
                  and ancestors.

              (3) It was agreed that the concept of witchcraft must be
                  debated and clarified further, as historically it has
                  been defined and understood in western terms. Traditional
                  leaders in particular stressed the importance of
                  protecting, preserving and promoting the institution of
                  traditional healing.


         25.     Should traditional doctors be obliged to explain
              diagnostic findings to their clients and society when the need
              arises?


              Practitioners were concerned that western doctors are never
              required to explain their diagnostic findings in respect of
              their patients to society. Would they be required, for
              example, to disclose diagnostic findings in respect of
              sexually transmitted diseases? The disclosure would certainly
              violate healer-and-patient confidentiality and trust. The only
              duty is and will always be to their patients. The only
              exception would be in the case of unexplained death. In this
              instance, the disclosure would be made to members of the
              immediate family. A submission from traditional leaders was
              that the healer should only divulge such diagnosis under oath
              in a tribal court. Society should only be given the general
              knowledge of the kind of illness which can be cured by health
              care practitioners, without labelling anyone as a patient.
              Patients should not be forced to give evidence against health
              care practitioners unless they so elect.


         26.     Should medicine dispensing methods be evaluated, if so, by
              whom and how?


              (1) Practitioners agreed that there was a need for the
                  formation of a national structure for all health care
                  practitioners. The function of this structure, inter
                  alia, would be -


                  (a)  to register all health care practitioners, including
                       their contact details and area of specialisation;

                  (b)  to formulate policy and strategic direction on all
                       issues affecting health care practitioners;

                  (c)  to establish standards for admission, conduct and
                       practice;

                  (d)  to ensure that practitioners have access to legal
                       advice;

                  (e)  to establish linkages with other bodies, in
                       particular the Registrar of Patents, Designs and
                       Trade Marks, so as to have access to and monitor the
                       registration of patents based on indigenous knowledge
                       or genetic material.


              (2) The practitioners and traditional healers emphasised the
                  importance of ensuring that this national structure is
                  driven and managed by the indigenous health care
                  practitioners themselves and not by western doctors or
                  researchers.


         27.     Establishing fact-finding mission on IKS


              Do you believe that the government should constitute a fact-
              finding mission on IKS, whose function would, inter alia, be
              to -


              (1) investigate work done by all role-players on IKS to date;

              (2) investigate the appropriate structure for use by
                  practitioners on IKS to eliminate their marginalisation;

              (3) evaluate IKS priorities, legislation, policy development,
                  international linkages and implications; and

              (4) make the necessary recommendations on IKS issues?


              If so, how should this fact-finding mission be constituted and
              what other issues should it cover?


         28.     Traditional leaders submitted that the establishment of
              the fact-finding mission was a key issue, for the following
              reasons:


              (1) A multiplicity of parties are involved in IKS work without
                  the necessary co-ordination.

              (2) It is impossible to establish the identity of and the
                  nature of IKS work being done by the various parties.

              (3) There was therefore a real risk of losing valuable IKS
                  work, given the current method of operation.

              (4) It would be difficult to formulate or establish a register
                  without knowledge or access of IKS work.

              (5) It would make recommendations and clarify some issues
                  which were not dealt with sufficiently or at all during
                  the public hearings, in particular the issue of resources
                  to be allocated to IKS.


         29.     Other participants felt the establishment of this fact-
              finding mission would create awareness on IKS and greater
              involvement of practitioners and indigenous people. A concern
              had been raised during the hearings on the difficulty of
              ensuring greater involvement of indigenous people in IKS. The
              fact-finding mission would make recommendations on -


              (1) education and awareness strategies that need to be
                  developed to encourage debate on IKS;

              (2) short-term protection strategies, which can be implemented
                  without the need for the enactment of the IKS
                  legislation;

              (3) the format of a pre-legislation body, which would be
                  responsible for co-ordinating IKS-related work;

              (4) the formation of national and international networks for
                  indigenous people, which would share knowledge and
                  experience;

              (5) innovation and sustainability of current research
                  methodologies in IKS, and the development of code of
                  ethics in consultation with indigenous people for
                  researchers and third parties on IKS research;

              (6) the nature of Collective Administrative Agencies and the
                  structure to which such agencies must be attached;

              (7) creating conditions for the establishment of an atmosphere
                  of trust; and

              (8) finalisation and passing of IKS legislation.


         30.     The fact-finding mission should also make recommendations
              on long-term strategies:


              (1) Inclusion of IKS in school curricula.

              (2) Access to indigenous land of Khoisan traditional leaders
                  who have been dispossessed without the provision of
                  alternative land on which they would continue to practice
                  indigenous cultural heritage.

              (3) Promotion of IKS after legislation.


         31.     There was no agreement on the nature of the fact-finding
              mission. Some participants felt that it could be in the nature
              of a commission headed by a judge who had expert knowledge on
              indigenous law. Others felt that the commission must be
              chaired jointly by a judge and an indigenous intellectual,
              whilst another group felt that a commission could be based on
              existing local government structures, with the proviso that
              indigenous people should play a key role there.


     E.     Conclusion


         1. The purpose of the public hearings was to -


              (1) assess whether the Bill adequately addresses the needs and
                  concerns of indigenous people, and if not, to establish
                  the extent and nature of needs and concerns which require
                  further consideration; and

              (2) have further consultation and debate on such issues, and
                  from such discourse attempt to develop a basic framework
                  for the improvement of protection, recognition and
                  promotion of indigenous knowledge.


         2. The basic principles emanating from the discourse at these
              hearings can be summarised as follows:
              (1) The Bill requires revision and amendment to construct a
                  broader definition of IKS. Indigenous health care
                  practitioners regarded the indigenous knowledge of plants
                  and animals as an important manifestation of their
                  indigenous knowledge, which is exploited without
                  recognition and benefit-sharing. Most health care
                  practitioners are at loss as to how to protect their
                  knowledge and organise themselves to prevent further
                  exploitation.

              (2) The categories of cultural heritage ("ubuntu") and
                  liberatory processes ("lekgotla/inkundla") require
                  further consideration and debate so that they can be
                  properly articulated in legislation. In the present
                  period of violence and break-down of family values, these
                  categories could play an essential role. We have seen
                  that indigenous methods of conflict resolution and
                  management have been regarded as relevant and useful
                  elsewhere.

              (3) The legislative framework for the protection of IKS has to
                  be revisited. What has come out of these hearings, is
                  that the current legislative framework needs further
                  consideration. It has been suggested that the following
                  must be used to protect IKS:


                  (a)  Geographical indications.

                  (b)  Certifications and Collective Marks.

                  (c)  Trade secrets.


                  In fact, a recommendation was made to institutionalise
                  trade secrets for the protection of other manifestations
                  of IKS. Participants argued that trade secrets have been,
                  and continue to be, used by indigenous people to protect
                  their knowledge.


              (4) The concern raised by other commentators that (unless SA
                  IP laws are amended to provide for the protection of IKS)
                  the manner in which IPR has been extended to IKS,
                  violates international agreements such as TRIPS and the
                  Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial
                  Property), requires further consideration. Other
                  commentators argue that certain aspects of IPR which are
                  group-oriented (geographical indications; Certifications
                  and Collective Marks) could be used to protect IKS
                  without violating any international agreements.

              (5) WIPO has indicated that the issues of IPR and the
                  protection of IKS are complex. They have indicated that
                  they would be prepared, if so requested, to comment
                  further in this regard. The Registrar of Patents, Designs
                  and Trade Marks, Mr Netshitenzhe, has also indicated that
                  he would be happy to assist in this regard. He has been
                  working closely with the OAU on the Model Law for the
                  protection of indigenous knowledge in the African Region.

              (6) The question of establishing appropriate structures for
                  the administration and promotion of IKS was extensively
                  debated. Practitioners feel alienated and helpless
                  because of the lack of representative structures on IKS.
                  The importance of establishing the following structures
                  was stressed:


                  (a)  The Regulatory Authority.

                  (b)  Provincial Trusts.

                  (c)  Interim co-ordinating structure.


              (7) The nature of the involvement of traditional leaders
                  requires further consideration. Traditional leaders saw
                  their role in IKS as of an administrative nature. Further
                  discussions with the House of Traditional Leaders should
                  be held to clarify the role of traditional leaders.

              (8) An integrative, innovative and indigenous context-based
                  approach, which would respect the intellect and autonomy
                  of indigenous intellectuals and practitioners and foster
                  mechanisms through the proposed structure, was seen as
                  the most important objective of this exercise.
