                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of
the Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with anguish the unfortunate tragedy which took place in
       Michigan in the USA where a six-year-old gunned down another six-year-
       old in the classroom;
  (2) further notes that similar tragedies are not confined to the USA but
       are a disturbing growing worldwide phenomenon and that South Africa,
       as part of the global community, is not immune to such incidents
       where children get involved in acts of murder;


  (3) calls on all parents and leaders to rededicate themselves to their
       God-given roles, to guide our children towards responsible adulthood;


  (4) calls on South African parents and leaders, in particular, to ensure
       that they execute their leadership duties in such a way that our
       children grow up to become human, patriotic and responsible adults
       who are respectful of human rights; and


  (5) conveys its sympathy to the family, relatives and schoolmates of this
       innocent victim.

Mnr J L THERON: Mnr die Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting van die Raad
sal ek voorstel:


  Dat die Raad daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) aangesien die Demokratiese Party die oorgrote meerderheid van
       Afrikaanssprekende kiesers verteenwoordig, die DP dit noodsaaklik
       geag het dat die Afrikaanse saak ook in die Nasionale Raad van
       Provinsies paslike verteenwoordiging sal geniet; en


  (2) me Embré Gouws aangewys is as die segspersoon vir Afrikaans in die
       Nasionale Raad van Provinsies vir die Demokratiese Party.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Mr Chairperson, at the next sitting of the House I will
move:


  That the House takes cognisance of the fact that -


  (1) since the Democratic Party represents the overwhelming majority of
       the Afrikaans-speaking members of the electorate, the DP has deemed
       it essential that the cause of Afrikaans should also enjoy suitable
       representation in the National Council of Provinces; and


  (2) Ms Embré Gouws has been designated as the Democratic Party
       spokesperson for Afrikaans in the National Council of Provinces.]

Me E C GOUWS: Mnr die Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting van die Raad sal
ek voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die vorige President se standpunt dat
       Afrikaanssprekendes geregtig is op 'n universiteit wat Afrikaans as
       voertaal het; en


  (2) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om -


       (a)  dié beginsel te bevestig; en


       (b)  'n proses van oorlegpleging te begin om so 'n universiteit aan
           te wys en so te verseker dat die vorige President se visie ten
           opsigte van tersiêre onderrig volvoer word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Mr Chairperson, at the next sitting of the House I will move
-


  That the House -


  (1) takes cognisance of the former President's standpoint that Afrikaans-
       speaking people are entitled to a university having Afrikaans as a
       medium of instruction; and


  (2) appeals to the Government to -


       (a)  confirm this principle; and


       (b)  begin a process of consultation with a view to identifying such
           a university and thus ensuring that the former president's
           vision in respect of tertiary education is fulfilled.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem -


  (1) van voorstelle wat in die lug hang ten opsigte van 'n borsbeeld of
       iets soortgelyks van die vorige President van Suid-Afrika,
       oudpresident Nelson Mandela, op of in die eiendom van die nasionale
       Parlement;


  (2) dat daar ook voorstelle is van soortgelyke afbeeldings van al drie
       die staatsleiers wat betrokke was by die oorgang na 'n demokratiese
       Suid-Afrika;


  (3) dat daar voorgestel gaan word dat dié gedagtes formeel geformuleer
       moet word en aan die Komitee oor Huishoudelike Reëlings voorgelê word
       vir verdere bespreking sodat uitvoering gegee kan word aan dié
       prysenswaardige idees; en


  (4) dat die Nuwe NP vantevore al voorgestel het dat daar  afbeeldings van
       ons staatsleiers in die Parlement aangebring moet word en selfs
       aangebied het om dit tydelik beskikbaar te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting I shall move:
  That the House notes -


  (1) proposals that are up in the air with regard to a bust, or something
       similar, of the former President of South Africa, former President
       Nelson Mandela, on the property of the national Parliament;


  (2) that there are also proposals regarding similar portrayals of all
       three public leaders who were involved in the transition to a
       democratic South Africa;


  (3) that it will be proposed that these ideas be formally formulated and
       submitted to the Committee on Internal Arrangements for further
       discussion so that these commendable ideas can be implemented; and


  (4) that the New NP has previously proposed that portrayals of our public
       leaders should appear in Parliament, and has even offered to make
       these available temporarily.]

      FLOOD DISASTER IN NORTHERN PROVINCE, EASTERN CAPE, MPUMALANGA AND
                                 MOZAMBIQUE
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the enormous and dedicated commitment of the South African
           National Defence Force in terms of human resources and amenities
           in the rescue operations conducted in the Northern Province, the
           Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and Mozambique;


       (b)  the commitment of the Government to make available finances and
           other resources to our people and neighbours; and


       (c)  the support from countries such as the United States of America,
           Britain and Botswana and from Europe and other countries;


  (2) commends the Minister of Defence and members of the SANDF for their
       sustained support in rescuing and alleviating the plight of people;


  (3) recognises the efforts of the Government and supports its responses;


  (4) encourages donor countries to effectively increase their support,
       given the magnitude of the devastation to life and limb; and


  (5) assures the people within our borders and our neighbours that we are
       also shattered by and concerned at the disaster that has affected
       them.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   USE IN WESTERN CAPE OF FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT FROM NORTHERN HEMISPHERE
                                  COUNTRIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) cognisant of the fact that seasonal fires ravage parts of the
       northern hemisphere areas that endure long hot and dry summers, such
       as Mediterranean climatic regions, and given that we in the Western
       Cape have to endure similar problems in our summer, requests the
       Minister of Foreign Affairs to consider the following:


       (a)  North America and Europe have specialist dedicated fire-fighting
           aircraft that are on standby in their summer fire season and
           that are ``moth-balled'' in their winter when the rains and snow
           come; and


       (b)  being in the southern hemisphere our fire hazards occur in our
           summer, which is their winter;


  (2) therefore requests the Minister of Foreign Affairs to investigate the
       possibility of requesting friendly nations to store their seasonally
       required aircraft and/or equipment in the Western Cape in their off-
       season, to be available to us to deal with fires;
  (3) is of the opinion that -


       (a)  the Minister could request co-operation on the basis of a shared
           world responsibility of the Fynbos biome at the Cape;


       (b)  we could hire the equipment and/or aircraft at reasonable
           tariffs in their off-season;


       (c)  we could allow northern hemisphere nations free storage and
           maintenance here in their winter, using the equipment only if
           and when required, perhaps at some predetermined tariff; and


       (d)  this could be a cost-effective way of dealing with the ongoing
           problem of mountain and bush fires at the Cape, without
           expending capital and that this could help northern hemisphere
           nations to get the maximum benefit out of their equipment; and


  (4) calls upon the Minister of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with
       the concerned provinces, the Western Cape government, the Department
       of Water Affairs and Forestry and the Department of Environmental
       Affairs and Tourism, with a view to possible further action.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Is there any
objection to the motion? There is an objection to the motion by Ms Botha of
the DP, and it will therefore become a notice of motion.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I find that very extraordinary, because the hon
member's colleague, who is a Whip, approved the motion at the Whips'
meeting.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That was done
outside this Chamber. We do not entertain matters which happened outside
this Chamber.

  STATEMENT BY WESTERN CAPE MEC FOR EDUCATION AND FAILURE OF DP TO EMBRACE
                                NONRACIALISM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B N DLULANE: Mr Chairman, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes with concern the recent report in a newspaper where the MEC for
       education in the Western Cape, Mrs Helen Zille, is reported to have
       said that the referral of a pupil to Harold Cressy High School, which
       was perceived by the pupil's parent to be a predominantly Muslim
       school, is ludicrous;


  (2) further notes that the statement by the MEC, Mrs Zille -


       (a)  is a clear indication of her stance and that of her party on the
           issue of the integration in schools;


       (b)  is a clear reflection of the DP's refusal to deal with racism
           and sectarianism - reluctance stems from its desire to replace
           the New NP as the champions of racist and sectarian politics in
           South Africa;


       (c)  shows that the DP is the apologist of apartheid as was also
           shown by its leader, the hon Mr Tony Leon, where he criticised
           the President for raising the issue of racism in his
           presidential speech; and


       (d)  reflects the unwillingness on the part of the DP to embrace
           values of nonracialism and nonsectarianism enshrined in the
           Constitution; and


  (3) supports the call of the ANC in the Western Cape for the MEC of
       education to resign.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Is there any
objection to the motion?

Mr J L THERON: Ja, ons maak ten sterkste beswaar, Voorsitter. [Yes, we
object in the strongest possible terms, Chairman.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! In the light
of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion without
notice will now become a notice of motion.

 CONGRATULATIONS TO CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP ON ELECTION AS CHANCELLOR OF THE
                               CAPE TECHNIKON

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE NCOP: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its heartfelt congratulations to the Chairperson of the
       National Council of Provinces, Ms Naledi Pandor, who has been elected
       as the second Chancellor of the Cape Technikon with effect from 14
       April 2000;


  (2) notes that Ms Pandor will be the first black woman to fill this
       position and will succeed Mr Pieter Swart, who has served as
       Chancellor since December 1995;


  (3) further notes that Ms Pandor has served on the Council of the Cape
       Technikon since 1996 and was elected to Parliament in 1994, after
       which she became a Whip and then Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority
       Party in the National Assembly; and


  (4) is confident that the Cape Technikon will benefit from the skills,
       experience, leadership and the capacity Ms Pandor will bring with
       her.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    SAPS STAFF SHORTAGES IN WESTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mev J WITBOOI: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met kommer daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die SAPD in die Wes-Kaap 'n personeeltekort van 40% het;


       (b)  40% van die SAPD-voertuie in die provinsie se vervangingsdatums
           reeds verby is; en


       (c)  21 polisiekantore elke dag om 16:00 moet sluit weens 'n tekort
           aan personeel;


  (2) 'n beroep op die Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit doen om die
       provinsie se nood te verlig; en


  (3) gemeenskappolisiebeamptes bedank vir hulle bydrae om polisiëring in
       die Wes-Kaap moontlik te maak.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Mr Chairperson, I move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern that -


       (a)  the SAPS in the Western Cape has a staff shortage of 40%;


       (b)  the replacement date of 40% of SAPS's vehicles in the province
           has already expired; and


       (c)  21 police stations have to close at 16:00 every day owing to a
           shortage of staff;


  (2) appeals to the Minister for Safety and Security to bring relief in
       respect of the need of the province; and


  (3) thanks community police officers for their contribution to making
       policing in the Western Cape possible.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     RECONCILIATION AMONG SOUTH AFRICANS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Mr Chairperson, I move:


  That the Council -
  (1) states categorically that nothing could be further from the truth
       than the recent negative reporting on racism and emotional sentiments
       expressed in diverse quarters on the subject, and also on the fact
       that some prophets of doom label so-called racism as the main
       impediment to reconciliation in South Africa;


  (2) believes that it is patently dishonest to deny that all over South
       Africa, in almost every walk of life, be it the workplace, the
       shopping malls, arenas of recreation, residential townships ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member, is
that a motion without notice, or is it a speech? [Interjections.] Please
continue.

Mr N M RAJU:


       ... and even in schools and educational institutions, there is an
       awakening and consciousness of new-found respect for each other among
       the silent majority of South Africans of all races;


  (3) is convinced that whatever sediments of racism remain in the bosom of
       individuals, it is not enough to sabotage the new and vibrant
       emergence of interracial understanding, goodwill and fellowship that
       become more and more conspicuous by the day; and


  (4) believes that right-thinking South Africans can only welcome and
       marvel at this new emergence of kindred spirits, while others seem to
       indulge in a debilitating exercise in hysterics.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Mr Chairperson, may I enquire whether the
hon member has been mandated by his party? The last time he expressed
similar sentiments he was instructed to withdraw the motion. I would like
to know before I consider whether to object to or support the motion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Let us leave
that for a while, hon member. Do you have an objection?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: No, I do not have an objection, Mr
Chairperson, I have a question.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): No, I am looking for
an objection.

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, I wish to second the motion. [Laughter.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! The next
member is the hon Versveld.

Ms E C GOUWS: No, you are confused, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I am not
confused. I have a list, and the hon Gouws is on the list. She is, however,
not the next one on the list. She can continue. I just wanted to show that
I am not confused.

Mr M J BHENGU: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it parliamentary for
the hon member to refer to the Chair as confused?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Well, I have
accepted it. I am not confused.

Me E C GOUWS: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die wyse waarop die Minister van Finansies in sy
       Begrotingstoespraak erkenning gegee het aan vyf van die land se
       amptelike tale, naamlik Engels, Afrikaans, Sotho, Zoeloe en Xhosa;


  (2) die Minister bedank;


  (3) die beginsel van die erkenning van veeltaligheid in Suid-Afrika
       opnuut bevestig.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Mr Chairperson, I move -
  That the House -


  (1) notes the manner in which the Minister of Finance in his Budget
       speech gave recognition to five of the country's official languages,
       namely English, Afrikaans, Sesotho, isiZulu and isiXhosa;


  (2) thanks the Minister; and


  (3) confirms once more the principle of the recognition of
       multilingualism in South Africa.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              PROPOSED CODE OF ETHICS FOR MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) again takes note of section 2 of the Executive Members' Ethics Act,
       1998, Act 82 of 1998, in terms of which the President must, after
       consultation with Parliament and by proclamation in the Gazette,
       publish a Code of Ethics prescribing standards and rules aimed at
       promoting open, democratic and accountable government and with which
       Cabinet members, Deputy Ministers and MECs must comply in performing
       their official responsibilities;


  (2) further notes that a draft Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament
       has been tabled at the Joint Committee on Ethics and Members'
       Interests for discussion and comment by political parties and
       members;


  (3) in the light of the aforesaid, requests the Chief Whip of the Council
       to establish from the President's Office when the Code of Ethics
       envisaged in the aforesaid section 2 of Act 82 of 1998, will be
       submitted to Parliament for consultation and what progress has to
       date been made in the drafting of such Code of Ethics; and


  (4) requests the Chief Whip of the Council to report back to the Council
       at its next sitting.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Is there any
objection to the motion?

Mr M BHABHA: Yes, we object.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! In view of the
objection, the motion will not be proceeded with. The motion without notice
will now become a notice of motion.

 CONDOLENCES TO FLOOD VICTIMS AND THANKS AND CONGRATULATIONS TO SA AIR FORCE
                                   MEMBERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Chair, on behalf of the New NP, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) extends its sincerest and heartfelt condolences to the families and
       friends of so many people who have perished and are at this moment
       still perishing, and our sympathies to those who have lost up to
       their very last and their most precious possessions as a result of
       the devastating floods experienced in especially Mpumalanga and the
       Northern Province, and by our neighbours in Mozambique and Zimbabwe;


  (2) thanks the men and women of the SA Air Force who have selflessly
       exposed themselves ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! There is a
point of order.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Mr Chairperson, I support wholeheartedly the
sentiments expressed by my hon colleague, but, truly, a motion
incorporating all these sentiments has been put to the Council by Mr
Sulliman and was adopted. Therefore this is in fact a repeated motion. I
object on that basis.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,
how does that motion differ from the motion tabled by the hon Sulliman?

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, it differs slightly in the wording, but there
was a special last part which I would like to read.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Can I find out
whether you want to amend Mr Sulliman's motion? Are you suggesting an
amendment to the motion which has been adopted?

Dr E A CONROY: Can I add an amendment then, Chairperson? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Can you read that
motion, and then we will compare it and give a ruling.

Dr E A CONROY: Thank you, Chairperson. I continue:


       ... to mortal danger in their quest to save human lives, even that of
       baby Rositha, who in the very first hours of her life has become a
       living symbol of the Air Force's motto, Per aspera ad astra, which,
       roughly translated means ``Through wind and storm to the stars''.


  (3) expresses that it is truly proud of our angels of mercy and grateful
       that we have the capacity, the will and, yes, the compassion, to
       extend a hand and open our hearts to our less fortunate compatriots
       and neighbours who had to submit to the forces of nature.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Thank you. We
will reserve the question and give a ruling before the end of the sitting.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, in the light of the enormity of
the disaster and the good sentiments expressed, I withdraw my objection.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! The Chief Whip
of the Council has withdrawn his objection. Does any other member wish to
object to the motion?

  ENVISAGED ALTERATIONS TO SOUTH AFRICA HOUSE AND PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad die Minister van Openbare Werke asook die Minister van Kuns,
  Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie versoek om -


  (1) die beoogde veranderings aan Suid-Afrika-huis in Londen openbaar te

       en behoorlik toegeruste instelling onder beroepskundige toesig aan
       die publiek ten toon te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council requests the Minister of Public Works as well as the
  Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology to -


  (1) publicise the envisaged alterations to South Africa House in London,
       leaving sufficient time for comment by the public and the South
       African Parliament; and


  (2) put on display to the public, under professional expert supervision,
       any cultural treasures that have been earmarked for removal in a safe
       and properly equipped institution.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         LAUNCH OF NATIONAL LOTTERY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today is the first day in which the National Lottery is

  (2) further notes that many South Africans are hopeful to gain some
       winnings from the first draw of the lottery which will take place on
       8 March 2000;


  (3) congratulates Uthingo on having successfully launched the lottery;

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it
parliamentary to give commercials to the House? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Is there any
objection to the motion?

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                    (The late Mr Caleb Humalebe Motshabi)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the draft resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with deep regret the passing away of Mr Caleb "Commandant"
       Humalebe Motshabi, a member of the Select Committee on Security and
       Constitutional Affairs, who passed away on 31 January 2000 after a
       short period of illness;


  (2) further notes that Mr Caleb Motshabi was a dedicated, disciplined and
       committed person in struggles against apartheid and in the
       transformation of our country and that his passing away has really
       touched members of this Council - he will be missed for his humour,
       his goodwill and his quiet and sometimes robust authority; and


  (3) conveys its sincere condolences to his family.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Well, in the
light of the fact that the deceased was a member of this august House and
that we are meeting for the first time since his demise, may I accordingly
request this honourable House to rise and observe a moment of silence.

          PROMOTION OF MULTILINGUALISM IN A DEMOCRATIC SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit is vir my aangenaam om hierdie
debat in te lei ... [Mr Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to introduce this
debate ...]

... and I want to start off by being bilingual.

The South African decision to adopt 11 official languages and so officially
support a multilingual language policy represents a landmark in the history
of language policies around the world, Marielle Martinez, an international
language expert, said. She further said:


  It reflects a new approach to language diversity and an unprecedented
  awareness of the importance of language issues in general and linguistic
  human rights in particular. This is the first time language rights are
  seen as a founding principle in the process of establishing a state. Very
  few countries even mention language in their constitutions. It breaks
  away from the European model of the monolingual nation state.


  The language policy has an important role to play in the process of
  democratisation and empowerment.

I want to add to this that it has an important role to play in nation-
building.

Wanneer ons praat van die bevordering van veeltaligheid in ons nuwe
demokrasie, en ons het 'n probleemgedrewe benadering, beteken dit eintlik
maar net die bevordering van eentaligheid.

Die oneweredige magsverhoudings tussen sprekers van verskillende tale word
voortdurend hierdeur beklemtoon en dit versterk dan net hierdie feit. Die
gevare van so 'n eentalige benadering is onder andere die vernietiging van
die oog waarmee baie mense na die wêreld kyk; die vernietiging van mense se
selfbeeld en trots; die forsering van mense om deel te neem aan die
maatskaplike, politieke en ekonomiese lewe van Suid-Afrika in 'n taal wat
nie hul eie is nie; intellektuele verarming wat lei tot hoë vlakke van
ongeletterdheid, soos wat ons ken in Suid-Afrika, en 'n gebrek aan
innoverende en kreatiewe idees en deelnames. Dit kan Suid-Afrika nie
bekostig nie, maar dit is die pad wat ons bewustelik of onbewustelik loop
deur die alleengebruik van Engels in die sogenaamde belangrike plekke vir
belangrike sake.

In sy werk In Giglioti tref D Ferguson 'n onderskeid tussen ``high
functions'' en ``low functions of language use in society''. ``High
language functions'' word geassosieer met die gebruik van taal in die
sogenaamde ``high places'', byvoorbeeld in wetgewing, die regering, in die
openbare administrasie, opvoeding en regspleging, en ook in handel,
nywerheid, kultuursake, ensovoorts. Daar is gevind dat tale slegs ontwikkel
wanneer dit gebruik word in hierdie omstandighede. Ek is terloops bly om te
sien die Minister is terug.

In ons nuwe demokrasie word die gebruik van inheemse tale eerder afgeskaal
en afgeskeep op hierdie vlak en daar is internasionale voorbeelde wat
duidelik uitwys wat die gevolge vir die benadeelde tale is. Byvoorbeeld,
die Ierse taal, wat saam met Engels op papier 'n amptelike taal is, maar
selde indien ooit in hierdie sogenaamde ``high places'' gebruik word, is
nou selfs besig om aansien te verloor in die ``lower functions'', in die
sogenaamde huisgebruik.

Daar is dus 'n duidelike korrelasie tussen 'n taal se status en sy gebruik.
Dit is volgens die Grondwet die Staat se plig om stappe te doen wat die
inheemse tale van Suid-Afrika se status sal verhoog deur hulle te gebruik
in die belangrike plekke, en dit begin hier waar ons vandag staan.

As ons nie die inheemse tale van Suid-Afrika in die hoofstroomaktiwiteite
van ons lewe gaan begin gebruik nie, sal ons in die skaduwee van Europese
en ander noordelike lande bly lewe. Ontwikkeling, vooruitgang en ekonomiese
bemagtiging, wetenskap en tegnologie sal die monopolie bly en wees van 'n
klein groepie bevoorregtes van die samelewing, in samewerking met
buitelandse entrepreneurs, by wyse van die voormalige koloniale taal.

Daar sal geen innovering, kreatiwiteit en voortuitgang vir die gewone
mense, die ongeletterdes, die armes, die meerderheid van hierdie land wees
nie, as daar voortgegaan word met die praktyk van eentaligheid.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When we talk about the promotion of multilingualism in our new democracy,
and we follow a problem-driven approach, this in fact only implies the
promotion of monolingualism.

The unequal relations relating to power between speakers of different
languages are continuously being emphasised by this and it only serves to
strengthen this point. The dangers of such a monolingual approach is, inter
alia, the destruction of the eye with which many people view the world; the
destruction of the self-image and pride of people; forcing people to
participate in the socio-political and -economic life of South Africa in a
language that is not their own; intellectual impoverishment leading to high
levels of illiteracy, as we are familiar with in South Africa, and a lack
of innovative and creative ideas and participation. This South Africa
cannot afford, but it is the course that we have consciously or
subconsciously taken by using English only in the so-called important
places for important affairs.

In his work In Giglioti D Ferguson distinguishes between ``high functions''
and ``low functions of language use in society''. ``High language
functions'' are associated with the use of language in the so-called ``high
places'', for example in legislation, in government, in public
administration, education and administration of justice, as well as in
trade, industry, cultural affairs, etc. It has been found that languages
only develop when they are used in these circumstances. By the way, I am
glad to see that the Minister is back.

Instead, in our new democracy, the use of indigenous languages is being
scaled down and neglected at this level and there are international
examples that clearly elucidate the consequences that detrimentally
affected languages suffer, for example, the Irish language, which, on
paper, is an official language along with English, but which is seldom, if
ever, used in these so-called ``high places'', and is now even losing
esteem in the ``lower functions'', so-called domestic use.

There is therefore a clear correlation between the status of a language and
its usage. According to the Constitution it is the duty of the state to
take steps that would promote the status of the indigenous languages of
South Africa by using them in the important places, and this starts here
where we are standing today.

If we do not start using the indigenous languages of South Africa in the
mainstream activities of our lives, we will continue to live in the shadow
of European and other northern countries. Development, progress and
economic empowerment, science and technology will remain and be the
monopolies of a small group of privileged people in society, in co-
operation with foreign entrepreneurs, by means of the erstwhile colonial
language.

There will be no innovation, creativity and progress for the ordinary
people, the illiterate, the poor, the majority of this country, if the
practice of monolinguality continues.]
Dr Nonhla ... Nou het ek moeilikheid met die uitspraak van hierdie
veeltalige naam! [Dr Nonhla ... Now I am having difficulties with the
pronunciation of this multilingual name!]

Dr Nonhlanhla Mkhulisi of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology - and the Minister can help me with the pronunciation - stated
that the Constitution achieved equality of the 11 official languages, but
in reality only the legal status has changed. The survival of democracy in
South Africa is dependent on recognising, amongst others, that language
diversity is not a problem, but a challenge.

Die onus is op ons, die Parlement, die Regering, die leiers, om die proses
van veeltaligheid, soos vervat in ons Grondwet, 'n werklikheid te maak tot
voordeel van almal in Suid-Afrika. Hierdie beginsel geld ook vir die res
van Afrika se inheemse tale. Ons verskeidenheid is 'n hulpbron tot
nasiebou, vooruitgang, bemagtiging en ontwikkeling. Ons verskeidenheid is
'n hulpbron tot 'n werklike Afrika-renaissance. Ons is besorg oor en bestee
miljarde rande aan fisiese kommunikasiehulpmiddels soos paaie, telefone,
sellulêre fone, e-pos en brûe, maar nêrens sien ons 'n direkte begroting
vir die uitrol van intellektuele kommunikasiehulpmiddels en -projekte soos
taal nie.

Die tyd het opgeraak. Daar is 'n opwellende debat daar buite, en hier binne
is óns besig om skade aan te rig deur toe te kyk hoe eentaligheid in Suid-
Afrika die oorhand kry.

Ek sluit af. Laat ons nie na mekaar kyk en lag nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The onus is on us, Parliament, the Government, the leaders, to change the
process of multilingualism, as contained in our Constitution, into a
reality for the benefit of everyone in South Africa. This principle also
applies to the indigenous languages in the rest of Africa. Our diversity is
a resource for nation-building, progress, empowerment and development. Our
diversity is a resource for a true African renaissance. We are concerned
about and spend billions of rands on physical communication aids such as
roads, telephones, cellular telephones, e-mail and bridges, but nowhere do
we see a direct budget for making available intellectual communication
resources and projects such as language.

The time has run out. There is a growing debate out there, and in here we
are doing damage by looking on at the way that monolingualism is gaining
the upper hand in South Africa.

I conclude. Let us not look at one another and laugh.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, allow me to wish the Minister of Arts and
Culture well in the work that the Department is grappling with. Language is
language because it is built by words. Words can be used as instruments of
hurting or even killing, and words can also be used to heal and build a
better future for the people of this country.]

Laat my toe om die volgende te sê. Tydens die donker jare van gedwonge
verskuiwing in Suid-Afrika het 'n jong Duitser 'n gesprek gevoer met een
van die jong manne in Driefontein in die huidige Mpumalanga. Die jong
inwoner van Driefontein het aan die Duitser gesê: ``Ja, my baas.'' Die
Duitser sê toe: ``Moenie my baas noem nie! Hoor jy?'' Toe sê die jong man
onskuldig:``Ja, my baas.'' Selfs vandag in hierdie demokratiese beskawing
is daar Afrikaners wat baas genoem wil word. Dit is primitief. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Allow me to say the following. During the days of forced removal in South
Africa a young German had a conversation with one of the young men in
Driefontein in the current Mpumalanga. The young resident of Driefontein
said to the German: ``Yes, baas [boss]''. The German then said: ``Do not
call me ``baas'' [boss]! Do you hear me?'' The young man then innocently
said: ``Yes, baas [boss]''. Even today in this democratic society there are
Afrikaners who want to be called ``baas''. This is primitive.]

South Africa represents an exciting context in which to observe changes in
language behaviour. Language played a central role in the sociopolitical
history of this country. It has been an important factor in the development
of nationalism, in building the apartheid state and in the struggle against
it. Amongst the whites, language has maintained the distinction between the
people of British and Dutch descent.

Under British colonial rule, particularly after the Anglo-Boer War, there
was an attempt to suppress Afrikaner nationalism through curtailing the use
of the Afrikaans language. Later, when the NP came to power and established
the apartheid regime, Afrikaans was promoted and established as the second
official language of the country.

Language was also the catalyst for the upsurge of resistance to apartheid
in the 1970s. In an attempt to extend the dominance of the Afrikaans
language, the apartheid government decreed that Afrikaans, rather than
English, should become the medium of instruction in black schools. The
students reacted strongly against the apartheid regime and this continued
on numerous fronts for the next one and a half decades. That is why
language was central to black people's assertion of their identity and
rights. The struggle did not centre around demands related to their own
languages.

Today we have had to undertake a voyage of discovery into our antecedents
and our past as South Africans. It is generally accepted that the best way
for language development to occur is for the language to be used.
Obviously, every South African language has been used, some more widely
than others. Most unfortunately, some have been discouraged from use and
are in great danger of extinction whilst others have in effect become
extinct.

For a language to survive, it must be used for a wide range of functions
otherwise it begins to wither and die. Thus, were we to allow higher status
functions to be limited to English and Afrikaans only, the languages of the
aboriginal nations would eventually begin to wither and die. We have seen
this happen to many of the Khoi and San languages, and their extinction is
a loss not only to the communities which used them, but also to the nation.
It is a national disaster.

When a language dies, very often, a whole body of knowledge dies with it. A
rediscovery of ourselves is a task at hand to encourage the use of official
languages and all the other languages used in South Africa in a wider range
of contexts and for an increasing range of purposes.

[It is a bad thing to know the languages of other race groups? There are
people who do not want to learn other languages, yet they want others to
learn their own languages! To know the languages of other people is both an
honour and it is enriching.]

It is surprising to note that the first-language speakers of the two
official languages English and Afrikaans comprise only one quarter of the
population of the country. It is generally recognised that our linguistic
diversity is intimately linked to ethnicity. In many respects, the attempts
to force a link between linguistic and ethnic entities in the past was the
result of 19th century colonialism.

It is therefore a fact that linguistic autonomy of the nine African
languages was engineered in terms Western sociopolitical criteria, which
resulted in artificial language boundaries. This fact, in turn, gave rise
to the use of language and ethnicity as instruments to justify the
apartheid principle of divide and rule. In terms of the new Constitution of
the Republic of South Africa, the Government, and thus the Department of
Education, recognises that our cultural diversity is a valuable national
asset. Hence it is tasked, amongst other things, to promote
multilingualism, the development of the official languages and respect for
all languages used in the country - including the South African sign
language and the languages referred to in the South African Constitution.

The second point is that the inherited language in education policy in
South Africa has been fraught with tension, contradiction and
sensitivities, and is underpinned by racial and linguistic discrimination.
A number of these discriminatory policies have affected either ... [Time

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Die agb lid me E C
Gouws is die volgende spreker, en ek hoop ek is nie hierdie keer weer
deurmekaar nie! [Gelag.] [The hon member Ms E C Gouws is the next speaker,
and I hope that I am not confused again this time! [Laughter.]]

Ms E C GOUWS: Mr Chairperson, I am the confused one, because according to
the list I am to speak in English, but I am going to speak in Afrikaans.
Could you please ask the hon members to tune their earphones, please.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): U is welkom! [Gelag.]
[You are welcome! [Laughter.]]

Me E C GOUWS: Ons Handves van Regte plaas 'n besondere premie op taal,
kultuur en godsdiens. Ingevolge artikel 30 het elkeen die reg om die taal
van sy eie keuse te gebruik en om aan die kulturele lewe van sy eie keuse
deel te neem. Ingsgelyks beskerm artikel 31 die reg van taal-, kultuur- en
godsdiensgemeenskappe om hulle eie organisasie te bedryf. Teen hierdie
agtergrond moet ook dan die artikel wat met die amptelike tale handel,
verstaan word.

In die grondliggende bepalings van die Grondwet, in artikel 6, word 11
amptelike tale ingestel. Hoewel die gelykheid van status en aansien deur
die Grondwet gewaarborg word, is dit duidelik uit die bewoording van
subartikels (3) en (4) dat daar nie noodwendig gelykheid ten opsigte van
die gebruik van die tale gewaarborg word nie. Dié subartikels bepaal
naamlik dat die taalgebruike en -voorkeure van die bevolking op nasionale,
provinsiale en munisipale vlak in ag geneem moet word wanneer die gebruik
van die tale gereël word.

Die DP beklemtoon die reg van elkeen om te alle tye sy eie taal te gebruik.
Dit is 'n basiese reg. Wat die gebruik van amptelike tale en rekordhouding
deur die Staat betref, moet op die verskillende regeringsvlakke 'n
praktiese evaluering plaasvind en moet die algemene gebruik van tale in die
jurisdiksionele gebied van die regeringsvlakke in ag geneem word.

Die amptelike tale op munisipale vlakke sal aldus in die meeste gevalle op
drie te staan kom, behalwe in hoogs geïndustrialiseerde gebiede, waar dit
waarskynlik meer sal wees. Die DP glo dat dit in ooreenstemming sal wees
met die letter en gees van die Grondwet om in gevalle van twyfel eerder in
die guns van veeltaligheid te beslis - liewer meer as minder.

Afgesien van die staatsamptelike gebruik van taal, kom die heel
belangrikste aanwending van 'n taal onses insiens voor op die gebied van
die onderwys. Die DP spreek hom op opvoedkundige gronde sterk uit ten
gunste van moedertaalonderwys vir minstens die eerste sewe tot agt
skooljare. Gesien die plek wat taal in die breë kulturele lewe speel, is
die DP sterk ten gunste daarvan dat alle burgers toegang moet hê tot skole
met 'n voertaal van hulle eie keuse.

Die DP glo ook dat Suid-Afrika se belange gedien sal word as studente 'n
keuse sal hê om 'n universiteit of kollege by te woon wat die taal, kultuur
en etos van hulle keuse adem. In hierdie verband het die vorige president
hom in die openbaar uitgespreek ten gunste van ten minste een Afrikaanse
universiteit. Mnr Tony Leon, ons leier, het reeds in die openbaar 'n beroep
op President Mbeki gedoen om nou so 'n aanwysing te doen. Ek herhaal
hierdie oproep.

Die DP verset hom teen die gedagte dat daar meer en meer voorkeur aan een
taal gegee word. Veeltaligheid met 'n vrye keuse wat aan die taalgebruiker
gegee word, is 'n grondbeginsel van die DP. Vir hierdie keuse sal ons ons
beywer en hieroor sal ons weer en weer, en wéér, standpunt inneem.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Our Bill of Rights places a particular premium on language,
culture and religion. In terms of section 30 everyone has the right to use
the language of their choice and to participate in the cultural life of
their choice. Similarly section 31 protects the right of linguistic,
cultural and religious communities to maintain their own organisation. The
section which deals with the official languages must also be understood
against this background.

In the founding provisions of the Constitution, in section 6, 11 official
languages are recognised. Although equality of status and prestige is
guaranteed by the Constitution, it is clear from the wording of subsections
(3) and (4) that equality in respect of the usage of languages is not
necessarily guaranteed. These subsections provide that the language usage
and preferences of the population must be taken into account at national,
provincial and municipal level when the usage of the languages is arranged.
The DP emphasises the right of everyone to use their own language at all
times. This is a basic right. As regards the usage of official languages
and record-keeping by the state, a practical evaluation must take place in
the different tiers of government and the general usage of languages in the
jurisdictional sphere of the tiers of government must be taken into
account.

The official languages at municipal level will therefore in most cases
amount to three, except in highly industrialised areas, where it will
probably be more. The DP believes that it will be in accordance with the
letter and spirit of the Constitution in cases of doubt rather to rule in
favour of multilingualism - rather too many than too few.

Apart from the official usage of language, the most important usage of a
language is, in our opinion, in the sphere of education. With regard to
education the DP is very strongly in favour of mother-tongue education for
at least the first seven to eight school years. Considering the place which
language plays in general cultural life, the DP is strongly in favour of
all citizens having access to schools with a medium of instruction of their
choice.

The DP also believes that South Africa's interests will be served if
students will be able to choose to attend a university or college which
embodies the language, culture and ethos of their choice. In this
connection the previous president publicly expressed himself to be in
favour of there being at least one Afrikaans university. Mr Tony Leon, our
leader, has already publicly appealed to President Mbeki to make such a
designation now. I am now repeating this appeal.

The DP is opposed to the idea that more and more preference be given to one
language. Multilingualism with a free choice being given to the language
user, is a fundamental principle of the DP. We will strive to promote this
choice and we will continue to adopt this standpoint.]

I thank you. Enkosi. Ngiyabonga. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Sihlalo, ngicabanga ukuthi nxa sikhuluma ngalolu daba
kuyinkinga ukuthi sizofikaphi nalo ngoba sengathi udaba olunzima.
[Chairperson, I think that when we discuss this issue we will have a
problem with to what extent we are going to deal with it since it is a
serious topic.]
But if I may quote what Chinua Achebe said in 1964, he said:


  Is it right that a man should abandon his mother tongue for someone
  else's? It looks like a dreadful betrayal and produces a guilty feeling.
  But for me, there is no other choice. I have been given a language and I
  intend to use it.

He had no choice but to use it, simply because he was given a language by
force, of course.

The issue of language in this Parliament has been there for some time, and
it looks as if it will continue for some time, because it is very clear
that there is a section of us here who are worried that there is no
equality in the use of languages in Parliament. Administratively this was
addressed, and we thought that it was not practicable to use all languages.

However, what is interesting is that Afrikaans and English are the
languages that have been used in Parliament, and the languages of the
majority of our people have not been used. Now the complaint comes from the
other side of the line. That is the most interesting thing, because
actually the two languages, English and Afrikaans, are colonial languages
that had no intention other than to subjugate the African languages. That
is what puzzles me, and is my fundamental argument. For instance, English
occupies an unassailable position in our lives right now - in our culture
and our politics. [Interjections.]

During our schooling days any achievements in spoken or written English was
highly rewarded and acknowledged with prizes, prestige and applause.
English became the measure of intelligence and ability in all branches of
learning. It became the main determinant of our progress up the ladder of
formal education. Even today, if a nigger speaks good English or ``mooi''
[fine] Afrikaans, he or she is rated as an intelligent person and is even
able to get a job.

Those are the symptoms and signs of the mental damage caused by the
colonial demon. [Laughter.] Therefore, promotion of multilingualism should
start from the realisation that our African indigenous languages were
intentionally and purposely suppressed, and in this day and age of the
African renaissance, African languages should actually be given priority.
However, as one can see, we have not ranted and raved about the fact that
they are not given the first priority.

We all know what the causes of the 1976 Soweto riots were. It was none
other than Afrikaans which was imposed and forced down the throats of our
people. Apartheid forced Afrikaans down the throats of the majority of our
people. The Constitution, of course, allows 11 languages to be used as
official languages, which include Afrikaans and English.

Language has a dual character: it is both a means of communication and a
carrier of culture. For instance, if one takes English one finds that it is
spoken in Britain, Sweden and Denmark. However, for the Swedish and Danish
people English is only a means of communication, and is not a carrier of
culture. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

[Mr D M KGWARE: Mr Chairperson, hon members who are here this afternoon, we
are here to discuss a very difficult issue, an issue which deals with
empowering the various languages of the people of South Africa.

Let us not forget what happened in Soweto in 1976, when our children were
forced to have Afrikaans as their medium of instruction. This is an
important consideration which should be borne in mind when we deal with
this issue. We should never forget all the problems that were caused by our
languages, more especially Afrikaans and English.]

There were only two choices - English and Afrikaans. Ninety per cent of us
whose home language was any of the nine official languages, ie isiZulu,
isiXhosa, Sesotho etc, had no chance whatsoever of being taught in our
mother tongue. I am referring particularly to the situation that led to the
1976 riots. The situation was very bad.

The language which our mothers taught us as soon as we were weaned from the
breast was simply ignored. The language we first used to express our joys
and sorrows was ignored. The language we found solace in after a long day
of struggle to understand what we were being taught in school was ignored.
We were taught in Afrikaans without any regard or consideration for whether
we could speak or understand the language. Sometimes we sat there without
actually knowing what was happening.

Today South Africa has come a very long way from the dark days of
apartheid. When we drafted our Constitution, we took special care to
protect the unique diversity of our languages, religion and culture. We
knew how painful it was to have the most powerful form of any human
communication - language - snatched away from us and all but crushed in a
crude attempt by the apartheid government to suppress our spirit.

We in the ANC could never be that cruel to our people, regardless of what
language they speak. That is why we have written in our Constitution that
South Africa has 11 official languages.

Mathata a re kopanang nao ke gore re tshwanetse go ruta bana ba rona kwa

tshwanela. (Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[The problem we have encountered is that our children are taught in other
languages, which makes it difficult for them to understand their lessons.
On the question of facilities in the nearby schools, we find that our
children are sent back home from those schools because it is felt that they
are not good enough to attend them.]

It has been very difficult to send one's child to the so-called Model C
schools, even when they are nearby. One simply could not do that, because
that particular school would not be able to give tuition in Sesotho,
isiZulu or isiXhosa. One had to take one's child to a school 30 km away
instead of to a school in the neighbourhood.

We cannot afford, nor should we tolerate, a situation in which our children
are turned away simply because they do not speak the language. The last
thing we need in South Africa is lingualism. We were taught this painful
lesson in our fledgling democracy by the Vryburg situation and all the
other Vryburgs, especially in the remote rural areas of our country where
racism is still alive and well despite being outlawed.

However, we also cannot ignore the fact that we are no longer subject to
sanctions which effectively isolated us from the rest of the world. We are
part of the global village, something which our Minister of Trade and
Industry, Alec Erwin, can painfully attest to, given the unnecessary
complications encountered in the European Union negotiations.

As part of their continued education and training, our children need to
interact with the international community. What kind of preparations are we
making for that? For that purpose, we need to hold on to a language that
can be internationally recognised and understood. No matter how much we
want to rail against the injustice of promoting a coloniser's language, the
bitter irony is that for legal reports and all other intents and purposes,
we have to teach all of our children in English for now.

At the same time, whilst we - constitutionally, morally and in every way it
matters - acknowledge that we are a multilingual country, we need to manage
that diversity. We do not want to develop elitism in any of our languages,
and I believe that the answer may lie with the provinces and our local
government structures.

We should accept that each province has its own peculiar language grouping,
for example the Northern Cape has English, Afrikaans, Setswana and
isiXhosa, just as each of the nine other provinces have their own unique
combination of languages. Given this linguistic differentiation, provinces
should try to promote the idea that every school within a province be
responsible for ensuring that those languages are accommodated.

We should task MECs for education, together with local government
authorities, to investigate and report to the NCOP on this matter. We must
be clear that we are not seeking linguistic disempowerment or promoting
English for all schools, nor are we relegating any of the other languages
spoken in the provinces to second rate languages or marginalising them in
any way.

What we want for our children is not stigmatised multilingualism. May I for
a moment be allowed to make a biblical reference on the basis of which God
punished the wicked of the Tower of Babel by dividing them through
multilingualism. [Time expired.]

Ms S N NTLABATI: Chairperson, the key challenge facing our new democracy is
the need to rebuild the nation, which was severely fragmented by apartheid.
The debate on multilingualism and ethnic identities must be understood
within this context.

The new South Africa has given rise to the following: Firstly, the impetus
for the evolution of a broad nonracial identity. Secondly, the emergence of
ethnic and racial identities in new forms.

How do we reconcile this impetus? While an ethnic group comprises people
who share a sense of belonging together on the basis of cultural criteria
such as language, religion and customs, a racial group comprises people who
share certain physical characteristics such as skin colour. Ethnic groups
often flow from an in-group feeling of togetherness and usually define
their own boundaries.

However, it must be borne in mind that the terms ``ethnic group'' and
``race'' are often used interchangeably, and sometimes conflated with
nation, whereas nation refers to a group of people who share a common
territory, economy, political sovereignty and a sense of belonging to one
another. Hence nations can be multiracial and multi-ethnic. Nations can be
multilingual in the modern world, and they usually are.

An important consideration with regard to the promotion of national unity
is not that people should speak any one particular language, but that they
should be able to communicate. Multilingualism and national unity are
congruent - they are not contradictory. Therefore, ethnicity, as such, is
not inherently conflictual or irreconcilable with national identity. It is
the way ethnicity has been politicised - in particular the way it has been
used to secure economic and political goals - that is divisive and
undermines nation-building.

A nation has to be significantly forged on the basis of the existing
identities that pervade the country. A South African nation would have to
build on the positive and harmonious aspects of the ethnic identities of
people. The challenge, in fact, before our new democracy is to provide this
space for people to express multiple identities in a way that fosters the
evolution of a South African national identity.

As Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, as he then was, said in his famous speech,
``I am an African'':


  African renaissance rejoice in the diversity of our people and creates
  the space for all of us, voluntarily, to define ourselves as one people,
  the rainbow nation.

The notion of the rainbow nation paves the way for deepening nonracialism
in a multicultural environment.

Given the present phase in the nation-building process, considerable room
has been given for the expression of diversity. The new Constitution
provides for a commission for the promotion and protection of the rights of
cultural, religious and linguistic communities, and so does the Bill of
Rights.

The expression of this diversity must, however, ultimately serve to foster
national unity. For example, the language policy of the new South Africa
must ultimately provide for the use of and respect for all languages in a
way that simultaneously allows for the emergence of one or two main
languages that will facilitate that national unity. And those languages
will pave the way for us to enter into the global markets.

South Africa, in its approach to languages within the context of identities
and nation-building, is consistent with international norms as espoused by
the United Nations, which declared 1993 the Year of Indigenous People and
in 1995 launched the Decade of Indigenous People.

The reality of the global economy is that one's languages will be used more
frequently than others. It is something all countries will have to
confront. From South Africa to France, we will have to make sure that the
vibrancy of our languages is retained, although we use a common language.

We need to shape and guide our entry into the global community, so that our
participation does not occur at the expense of the growth of other
languages. An important precondition for economic growth and development is
the establishment of a stable and cohesive country. A fragmented country
cannot produce an economically growing country. Nation-building, based on a
multiple identity, is an important contributor to growth, just as a stable
currency and low levels of inflation would be.

Ngiyabonga. [I thank you.] Ndisaphila. [I am well.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairman, hon colleagues, ngiyanibingelela. [I greet you.] The
peoples of South Africa depict a rich kaleidoscope of diverse cultures and,
therefore, what we have in our country today is a multilingual Republic. As
the Constitution enshrines 11 official languages, it follows that the
vernacular or mother tongue of every cultural group or minority is assured
and respected.

Freedom of choice of language - like the other freedoms, ie religion,
speech and choice of residence - is the kernel of empowerment of especially
those South Africans who have been denied, through legislation or by a
misguided ideology, the free and unfettered use of their mother tongue.

To cultivate an interest in one's language and to ensure that the language
flourishes in all its splendour, is to guarantee the freedom of the
individual in every other respect. The education of our children demand
that communication is paramount in leading them from the known to the
unknown.

Mother-tongue instruction is indispensible when the child takes the first
tentative steps towards schooling. Let me ask you a rhetorical question, Mr
Chairman. What do you remember vividly: a story written in cold print or a
story you were told when you were seated on the lap of your grandmother or
grandfather, related to you in your beautiful mother tongue, replete with
imagery and figurative language?

Therefore, any attempt to stifle or undernourish the growth and flourishing
of any group's mother tongue is tantamount to a denial of one's freedom. It
would be an attempt to impugn the dignity of that group and, thereby,
diffuse the spirit of the Constitution.

No one cultural group must ever be slighted or made to feel inferior as was
the norm during the apartheid years. Incidentally, apartheid took away the
beauty and vibrancy of a language such as Afrikaans, which, because it was
a language of the regime, became tainted as being the language of the
oppressor.

We must not allow the language to languish in the backwaters of history.
Let our Afrikaner brethren - our fellow South Africans - refurbish their
language and restore it to its intrinsic worth. And so too I plead for
other indigenous languages, the languages of communities that speak
isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho, Setswana, etc, to do the same! Members have
heard this afternoonÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L SUKA: Chairperson, I would like to extend the membership card of the
ANC to some members of the opposition parties so that they can join the
ANC. I will do so very soon. [Laughter.] My speech on the matter that is
being discussed today is very brief.

Matters of social equity and justice are central to any policies on
multilingualism. Multilingualism involves the promotion of consciousness of
both language and cultural awareness amongst communities. The exercise is
empowering for the individual, and it is also politically liberating for
various social groups in this country.

So I will focus briefly on the role of PanSALB. The PanSALB Act, Act 59 of
1995, states that PanSALB has, amongst its other roles, a mandate to
promote multilingualism. The question that comes to my mind is: Has PanSALB
been able to encourage that kind of mandate? The answer to me is quite
clear - it has not achieved its objective of promoting multilingualism in
South Africa. There are various reasons for this. Amongst the challenges
the PanSALB board faces is the question of representivity. The composition
of the board, which is supposed to promote multilingualism, does not
represent all South Africa languages referred to in Section 3(1) of the
Constitution. The overrepresentation of other languages distorts the image
of multilingualism and the constitutional obligation of promoting their
equal use and enjoyment.

The fact that some official languages are not represented on the Board
poses a serious challenge in matters of social equity and justice. Does
that mean that there are no language experts in those languages that are
supposed to be brought on board? The board is also composed mostly of
academics from various academic institutions, and few members, if any, from
other language institutions such as schools, NGOs and the media.

Ngaba oku kuthetha ukuba azikho iingcali zeelwimi zethu kwiidyunivesithi
esinazo ezinjengeUnitra, i-Fort Hare, iDyunivesithi yaseMntla, i-Unibo,
nakumaziko osasazo? Kutheni singaziboni nje zikwibhodi eyongameleyo?

Ngaba iidyunivesithi ezimelweyo kule bhodi, eyase-Stellenbosch, eyase-Free
State neDyunivesithi i-Wits zinezona ncutshe na kwiilwimi zethu eMzantsi
Afrika? [Uwele-wele.] Ngaba ezi zinabantu abamnyama zijongelwe phantsi
nakule minyaka sithi sikhululekile? Ngaba oku kunika umfanekiso wokuba ezi
zifundiswa zona azikho kumgangatho othile onokwenza iinguqu kwiilwimi zethu
zeli phakade? [Uwele-wele.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Does this mean that there are no experts in our languages at our
universities such as Unita, Fort Hare, the University of the North, Unibo
and the broadcasting centres? Why do we not see them in the board that
oversees.

Do those universities which are represented on the board, the University of
Stellenbosch, University of the Free State and Wits University, have the
best experts even with regard to our languages in South Africa?
[Interjections.] Is it that those which are manned by black people are
being looked down upon even in these years of freedom? Does this give the
impression that these learned people are not of a certain quality that can
bring about change in the languages of this world? [Interjections.]]

Now I come to the visibility of the board.

Ayaziwa i-PanSalb, nkqu nalapha phakathi kwethu. Bambalwa abantu abaziyo
ukuba u-PanSalb ngokupheleleyo umele ntoni na. Ukuba ngaba bendinokuthi
ngoku masibhale ngokupheleleyo u-PanSalb, abantu abaninzi bangafumana
igungcu kwishumi. [Kwahlekwa.]

Ndithe le Pansalb ayaziwa ngabemi boMzantsi Afrika abaninzi. Yaziwa
ngabantu abafundileyo nabafunda amaphepha esilungu kuphela. Inxibelelana
kuphela noluntu olukwazi ukufunda la maphepha esilungu sithetha ngawo.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[PanSALB is not known, even amongst ourselves. Few people know what the
full name of the acronym PanSALB stands for. If I can say let us write out
the full name of PanSALB, many people would get less than ten. [Laughter.]

I said this PanSALB is not known by many people among South Africans. It is
only known to educated and those who read white people's newspapers. It
only communicates with people who can read these white people's newspapers
we refer to.]

They advertise their projects on language development in English and
Afrikaans newspapers whose readers are intellectuals.

Abantu bethu abakwisininzi kweli loMzantsi Afrika abaveli. [Our people who
are in the majority in South Africa do not appear anywhere.]

I have never heard any announcement on radio stations of projects promoting
the languages and multilingualism in South Africa. I have never seen any
fliers or brochures in African languages being used to inform the ordinary
man in the street.

Nditsho ndicinge ke kumaphandle anjengeKwaZulu-Natal neMpuma Koloni. [I
immediately think about the rural areas like those in KwaZulu-Natal and the
Eastern Cape.]

We always hear about launches at universities, such as literature
development at Unisa, on the grapevine. Communities do not receive any
feedback. The question is: For whose benefit are these projects? What is
their target group or class of society? I think that teachers, the media,
students and the public need to know about these projects in order to make
their inputs where necessary.

Le nto ke ndiyithetha kuba ndisazi ukuba kweliya lam iphondo inqabile
inkqubela-phambili kwiilwimi nakuMzantsi Afrika uphela kodwa zikhona zona
izigqeba (structures) kumaphondo alapha eMzantsi Afrika. [I am saying this
because I know that in my province and in the rest of South Africa progress
in languages is scarce, but there are structures in the provinces of South
Africa.]

Structures such as the provincial language committee have been established
in some provinces, such as the Eastern Cape. This is very much appreciated,
but these committees are almost not functional - I do not want to use a
strong word - and invisible to their communities. One of the reasons could
be that they are not close to the people on the ground. The emphasis is on
intellectuals. For example, no announcement about the committee, that is
the PLC, was made on radio stations such as uMhlobo Wenene. It was
published only in the Daily Dispatch, a local English newspaper in the
province. Was that enough to promote multilingualism? Certainly not at all.

For instance, up until now, provinces such as the Eastern Cape have no
language policy. Fortunately, it has also been mentioned here that this is
in the process stages at national level. I also understand that the reason
is that there is no national language policy which is being processed. So
it is a challenge. Ever since 1994 - and it is now six years down the line
- we have needed to accelerate change at this level.

On the question of the development of the previously marginalised
languages, up until now no specific language development projects have been
announced. The issue of the development of African languages has never been
a priority. The development of languages should have been a point of
departure before the establishment of the PLCs. African languages still
have their old status, after the old language bodies were abolished, whilst
other languages have never stopped developing, even today. That relates
also to the budget. Where one wants to develop this multilingualism at the
higher institutions, the budget always goes to those that are advantaged.
Our disadvantaged universities are nowhere to be found. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Mgcinisihlalo, lishonile nine bekunene. [Chairperson,
good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.]

In his speech on 13 August 1998, our President, Thabo Mbeki, then Deputy
President, spoke not for the first time, of the concept of an African
renaissance. He spoke of a need for Africa to move away from the conflict
of arms, wars, dictators, corruption and self-destruction, and become the
midwife of the African renaissance.

He saw the African renaissance as ``our rebirth as a continent'' and
defined it further by likening it to -


  ... our own rediscovery of our soul, captured and made permanently
  available in the great works of creativity represented by the pyramids
  and sphinxes of Egypt, the stone buildings of Axum and the ruins of
  Carthage and Zimbabwe, the rock paintings of the San, the Benin bronzes
  and the African masks, the carvings of the Makonde and the stone
  sculptures of the Shona.

His challenge to all of us was to -


  ... call for Africa's renewal, for a ... rebellion ... against the
  tyrants and the dictators ... who seek to corrupt our societies and steal
  the wealth that belongs to the people.

I believe we can have no African renaissance without the promotion of
African languages. We are not talking about paying lip service to reform by
putting ``black faces in white places'', but the implementation of a
viable, democratic language policy. If we fail to adopt short-term, medium-
term or even long-term plans to develop and enhance the status of our
indigenous languages in South Africa, we risk having the dominant political
group of apartheid South Africa playing the gatekeeper to privilege,
political power and economic prosperity.

In South Africa we have witnessed what the elevation of English and
Afrikaans as the official languages of government at all levels has done to
promote exclusionism. We have seen a language policy, driven by political
and ideological motives, cater primarily to the interests of white
supremacy and effectively ignore the needs of speakers of African and other
languages. If we fail to actively promote our African languages, we risk
maintaining a vicious cycle of the poor majority becoming poorer and being
even more marginalised, and the rich few becoming even richer. The
promotion of African languages is no small task, but we have never turned
away from a challenge before, especially when the stakes are as high as
they are now.

We have to conduct extensive research to demonstrate African languages as a
viable resource to promote our Africanness, our rich culture, our diversity
and our traditions. We must be proud of our African heritage.

Perhaps we have something to learn from African-Americans. There are some
indications that, at least in some quarters of American society, there is a
quest to return to their roots. Some African-Americans have interpreted
these roots to mean a return to Africa. Through a pilgrimage to Africa, the
celebration of Kwanza and other African ceremonies, and the wearing of
traditional African clothing and hairstyles, they demonstrate their close
association with Africa.

As a continent we need to recognise the potential that African languages
have as power tools in the rejuvenation of Africa. That potential is
unleashed in such settings as mediums for tuition in tertiary and primary
education institutions, business transactions, tourism and everyday
activities that add to the productivity of our continent. Unless we use our
indigenous languages in all aspects of our daily lives, they will not
become independent of the shackles of European influence.

After the 1994 election, we as a country were thrust into a new
international paradigm. These international norms and standards quickly
revealed both their pros and cons. The word ``globalisation'' and the
concept of a global village became entrenched in our society and its
ramifications did not hit us all at once. It was only a good few years into
our new democracy that we realised that we also needed to protect our
Africanness from the effects of globalisation.

We have learned, as a nation, that globalisation can only be truly
meaningful if all participants benefit equally, without any form of
exploitation taking place. We have learned also, that we need to sustain
the development of our African literature and culture. And we have learned
that our natural resources, such as minerals, agriculture and tourism
should benefit Africans first.

South Africa's - and indeed, all other African states' - rich language
heritage must be preserved at all costs. We need to recognise who we are
and where we want to be as a nation, as a continent.

Sinye-ke setibonelo tekubukelwa phansi kwetilimi tendzabuko yase-Afrika,
nguloku lokwenteka elulwimini lwesiSwati. Khona lapha ngekhatsi
kweNingizimu Afrika siSwati sitsatfwa njengelulwimi loluseluncane,
lolusakhasa. Kantsi sive semaSwati naso sive sendzabuko njenganobe ngusiphi
lesinye sive kuleti teluhlobo lwebeNguni. (Translation of Swati paragraph
follows.)

[One example of the undermining of indigenous African languages is the case
of the Swati language. Within South Africa siSwati is considered to be a
young language, yet the Swazi nation is as indigenous as any of the Nguni
ethnic groups.]

The African renaissance in the context of language should be seen as a
rebirth, redefinition, reawakening, re-evaluation and reaffirmation of our
linguistic heritage.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, hon members of this hon House,
multilingualism is a dynamic process which empowers the speakers of
different languages to convey messages in a language or languages of their
own choice. It also displays some measure of sensitivity for the need of
different communities to express themselves in their own indigenous
languages.

Prior to the homelands systems, the Dutch and English regimes had promoted
monolingualism in South Africa. The result was that the indigenous
languages lacked recognition and development. However, according to the
book People of South Africa: Population census 1996, more people speak
indigenous languages now than was ever reported in previous census
statistics.

In terms of section 6(5) of the Constitution, a Pan South African Language
Board has to promote and create conditions for the development of official
languages. The current budget reflects an increase in funding for the
National Language Services for the purposes of translating, interpreting,
editing, language planning and national terminology. Language is the most
important tool for the development of both individuals and communities in
offering them education, which would enable them to change their conditions
of life.

Language is a medium of transmission for political, commercial and
professional communication. The development of a whole country politically
and economically depends on communicative efficiency, which is based on
language.

(Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[Any nationality is proud of its language and culture. Whenever a person
wants to communicate his or her deepest thoughts to God, he or she does so
in his or her own mother tongue. Therefore, we in the UCDP support the
South African Constitution where it gives each nationality the freedom to
use its own language. We believe that no language should be used to
suppress other languages, as used to happen in the past. [Applause.]]

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, we must take it upon ourself to ensure that
never again as a nation do we create conditions that will render people
subject to humiliation because of the language they speak.

Nation-building is one of the central themes in contemporary African
society. Therefore we have to respond to our set of linguistic
circumstances and our cultural diversity in a responsible and constructive
manner. The present reality is neither preordained nor immutable, nor is it
immune from the forces of change that can be unleashed through a democratic
language revolution.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[The challenges that are faced by the policy of nation-building are, inter
alia, to enhance participation by the entire nation in matters that relate
to the development of this country's economy; to ensure that every citizen
is able to participate meaningfully in the development of all official
languages and to have the necessary access to education.

When we study the history of our country, we are shocked to note the havoc
caused by the enforced policy of bilingualism through which the majority of
the people were systematically excluded from having access to a meaningful
standard of living. Therefore, we should not use the language diversity as
an instrument to divide the nation.]

Instead, Deputy Chair, ours should be seen as a position of strength rather
than a position of weakness. Our goal is to maximise multilingual
communication competence ...

... go tswetsapele mekgwa ya go bopa le go aga dipolelo tsa naga ye, go
nyaka mekgwa ye mekaone ya go bopa poledisano ka maleme a, gape le go phela
mmogo bjaloka setšhaba se tee, moo maleme ka moka a hwetšago tlhompho le
maemo a maleba.  (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)
[... to promote and create conditions for the development of all official
languages, to seek meaningful methodologies of promoting multilingual
communication and to co-exist as one nation, in which all official
languages enjoy parity of esteem and respect for their status.]

Therefore, language policy and its implementation should not only
articulate language rights as a fundamental human right, but should also
focus on language as a functional resource, a vehicle for nation-building
and a functional and communicative element. It should not only be regarded
as a symbolic element in the lives of human beings and should not be used
as an instrument to divide our nation.

Daarom is dit van die uiterste belang - en dit is die verantwoordelikheid
van elke lid van die Suid-Afrikaanse volk - om 'n poging aan te wend, en om
aan te dring op die ontwikkeling van beter toestande vir nie net een nie
maar al die tale van die land, om sodoende te verseker dat daar samewerking
en 'n voorspoedige samelewing in Suid-Afrika sal wees. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Therefore it is of the utmost importance - and it is the responsibility of
every member of the South African nation - to endeavour to achieve, and
insist on the development of improved conditions for not just one, but all
the languages in the country, in order to ensure that there will be co-
operation and a prosperous society in South Africa. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I have always thought I have
beautiful features, but the member has just referred to me as ``Deputy
Chair'', who is a man. [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I am not going to comment on your
features. They are beautiful. [Laughter.]

Ons het vandag hier die ``magic'' beleef van die diversiteit van taal in
Suid-Afrika. Ek bedank ons tolkdiens vir die rol wat hulle gespeel het.

Ek het vandag by my kollegas die versugting gehoor dat daar 'n behoefte is
aan die erkenning van al die inheemse tale van Suid-Afrika, ook in die
praktyk. As ons praat van die bevordering van veeltaligheid, kan ons Engels
maar los. Engels is sterk genoeg en kyk wêreldwyd na homself. Ons soek
egter inligting in al ons inheemse tale, wanneer ons praat en vorms invul
vir grondhervorming, hospitalisering, ens. As ons dit bereik, sal ons
werklike deursigtigheid en bemagtiging hê. Die bepalings in ons Grondwet
moet nou 'n werklikheid word en nie net papierbeloftes bly nie.

Agb lede hoor die ongeduld en die vergelykings wat getref word met die
opstande van 1976. Gedurende die afgelope ses jaar het ons nog nie 'n
skakeltaal ontwikkel in Suid-Afrika nie. Vandag het vir ons bevestig dat
dit nie net een taal kan wees nie. Ek verskil van die agb lid mnr Suka - en
ek sê nie vir hom ``suka'' nie, ek verskil net van hom - oor sy insig wat
hy het rondom PanSAT. Ek wil PanSAT bedank vir die goeie werk wat hulle
reeds doen. So ook die taalkomitees wat in plek is en die ander rolspelers.

In die lig van die antwoorde vroeër deur die twee agb Ministers oor taal,
en van hierdie debat vandag en met die Grondwet in my een hand en die Reëls
van die NRVP in my ander hand is ek daarvan oortuig dat die tyd ryp is dat
ons in hierdie Huis 'n wesenlike bydrae moet lewer; dat ons iets op die
tafel moet sit. Ons moet ophou om partypolitieke punte te wil aanteken, om
suutjies te praat, te protesteer, en te verwyt, om net petisies te
onderteken en ongelukkig toe te kyk hoe die proses om veeltaligheid te
bevorder stadig of glad nie ontvou nie.

Ons het te doen met 'n staatkundige saak, wat staatkundig opgelos moet word
en daarom kondig ek nou amptelik aan as hulp dat ek môre volgens reël 178
van die Reëls van die NRVP 'n memorandum oor 'n privaatlidvoorstel vir 'n
Suid-Afrikaanse Talewet aan die Voorsitter van die Raad gaan voorlê.
Hierdie proses moet dan deursigtig en vinnig gehanteer word. Ons moet almal
gesien word as deel van hierdie proses om deur die ontwikkeling van hierdie
voorstel in 'n wetsontwerp 'n bydrae te lewer tot die werklike bevordering
van veeltaligheid in Suid-Afrika. As ek praat van ons almal, praat ek van
die ANC tot AZAPO, van Van Niekerk tot by Lubidla, van Vilakazi tot Lever,
van Pietersburg tot in die Kaap. [Tyd verstreke.][Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today we experienced the magic of the diversity of language in South
Africa here. I wish to thank our interpreting service for the role that
they played.

Today I heard from my colleagues the appeal that there is a need for the
recognition of all the indigenous languages of South Africa, also in
practice. When we talk about the promotion of multilingualism, we can
exclude English. English is strong enough and looks after itself worldwide.
However, we require information in all our indigenous languages, when we
speak and complete forms for land reform, hospitalisation, etc. When we
achieve that we will truly have transparency and empowerment. The
provisions in our Constitution must now become a reality and not remain
mere paper promises.

Hon members have heard the impatience and the comparisons that have been
drawn with the uprisings of 1976. During the past six years we have not yet
developed a lingua franca in South Africa. Today confirmed for us that it
cannot be one language only. I differ with the hon member Mr Suka - and I
am not telling him to ``suka'' [go away], I am merely differing with him -
regarding the insight he has about PanSALB. I want to thank PanSALB for the
good work they have already done. The same applies to the language
committees which are in place, as well as the other role-players.

In the light of the responses earlier by the two hon Ministers about
language, and of this debate today, and with the Constitution in one hand
and the Rules of the NCOP in the other, I am convinced that the time is
right for us in this House to make a decisive contribution; that we must
put something on the table. We must stop wanting to score party-political
points, talking softly, protesting and blaming, and merely signing
petitions and unfortunately having to stand by and see how the process to
promote multilingualism evolves slowly or not at all.

We are dealing with a political issue, which must be resolved politically
and in support of this I therefore now officially announce that tomorrow,
in terms of Rule 178 of the Rules of the NCOP, I am going to submit to the
Chairperson of the Council a memorandum on a private member's motion for a
South African languages Act. This process must then be dealt with
transparently and swiftly. We must all be viewed as part of this process,
by way of the development of this motion into a Bill, to make a
contribution to the real promotion of multilingualism in South Africa. When
I speak about all of us, I am talking about the ANC to AZAPO, from Van
Niekerk to Lubidla, from Vilakazi to Lever, from Pietersburg to the Cape.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]]

(Translation of Gujarati paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Deputy Chairperson, brothers and sisters, thank you very
much. Today I am going to speak in Gujarati. It is my mother tongue.

In South Africa there are 11 official languages. These 11 languages are
entrenched in our Constitution. Therefore, the state has a responsibility
to promote these languages spoken by the people of South Africa. Some say
there are about 25 additional languages, while others say that there may be
as many as 100 additional languages spoken by the people. The problem is
that it is not known how many other languages are spoken in South Africa.

Chairperson, today we must resolve to ask our Parliament to conduct
research into exactly how many languages are spoken in this country.

Today we also remember with great pride Mahatma Gandhi, who came here over
a century ago. He established an organisation for the Indian community.
Many hon members here have heard of the Indian Congress. This organisation
was one of the forerunners in the community in promoting Indian languages
and culture. It was also an ally of the ANC in the struggle to eliminate
apartheid in South Africa.

When Gandhi and people like my grandfather arrived in South Africa, they
brought indigenous Indian culture with them. They brought language, and
with it their communities' customs, culture and mannerisms.

People like myself were born in this country and adopted the culture,
customs and traditions of our forefathers. Alongside, we also adopted South
African culture, customs and traditions.

We bear a responsibility to pass this assimilation of culture, language and
traditions to our coming generations. We must teach them about diversity
and how to adopt other cultures. They must learn to adopt the good and
reject the bad in each culture. In this way we, as diverse communities, can
work towards building a united nation.]

Madam Chair, I decided to speak in Gujarati today because that is my mother
tongue. [Applause.] When I speak to my mom and dad at home, this is the
only language they speak. They refuse to speak to me in any other language.
I thought I should take the opportunity of speaking in that language.

But, following on that, I also want to just mention that the Vienna
Declaration and programme of action as adopted by the World Conference on
Human Rights on 23 June 1993 has this to say in its Article 2:


  All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right
  they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their
  economic, social and cultural development.

To the members who participated in this debate, I need to say that the
article goes on to say that -


  ... this shall not be construed as authorising or encouraging any action
  which would dismember or impair totally or in part the territorial
  integrity or the political unity of sovereign and independent states
  conducting themselves in compliance with the principles of equal rights
  and self-determination of the people.

I think it is very important that we take note of articles such as these
that have come through, because we are really not reinventing the wheel.
There are many other countries that have very diverse cultures and
extensive language usages. But many of those nations have found a way in
which they work together in order to develop a common universal culture and
identity as a nation. Everything we have heard in speeches today indicates
that. If the hon the Minister listened carefully to the speeches, there is
a tremendous amount of goodwill about adopting and assimilating cultures,
taking on each other's approaches and value systems, and learning from each
other's religions and backgrounds.

I think this is very encouraging. It says a lot about where we as a nation
would be going to in the next 100 years, which we call the African
renaissance. It has been very encouraging. I think that is the key
objective of this. There is no one key policy or approach that we can take.
We have to develop an organic approach through various processes that are
already under way - such as the PanSALB, the section 185 Commission and so
forth - to look for ways and means in which we can find this common
identity, and to find language usages that will allow us to, at the same
time, participate economically and in other manners in the global world
without undermining our own integrity as a nation. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I would
like to say: Sanibonani, molweni, dumelang, avusheni, goeie middag and good
afternoon. I have been highly impressed with the spirit in the NCOP. But it
should be so, because hon members bring to the national Parliament the
political will and the legislative role of the provinces.

It is with members that we should work to ensure that the provinces hasten
the process of multilingualism. They have the power to do so: it is a
concurrent legislative power. They should proceed, particularly in the
languages of learning and teaching. I believe that they do not need to wait
for national policies. Once they have selected the languages to be used
which are most popular in the provinces, they can proceed to teach history,
environmental studies and biblical studies in the indigenous languages
pertaining to that province.

Quite clearly, there are areas which are difficult. Areas such as
mathematics, science and technology will obviously need new terminologies
for most of the indigenous languages, because these languages do not cater
for those subjects. This is what we are busy with in the department:
creating terminologies that will enable mothers and fathers to talk to
their children in scientific and medical terms easily. The child does not
have to wait until he or she goes to secondary school, but will have been
able to conceptualise mathematics, science and technology in his or her
vernacular or indigenous languages.

A lot of work is being done at national level. The Pan South African
Language Board is doing an extremely good job, and I am glad that Mr Van
Niekerk has acknowledged this.

The gist of the proposed language policy and plan is the promotion of
multilingualism, and the development of the previously marginalised
languages - the African languages, the San and Khoi languages, and sign
language - and also to support the constitutional notion of parity of
esteem and an equitable use of languages.

It is being considered that we may have to resort to the rotation of
official languages - possibly six languages on a rotational basis - for
national purposes. The provinces will obviously select those languages -
usually three or four languages - that are popular in a province, but we,
at national level, have to cater for the whole spectrum of diversity, and
we will have to find practical ways to do so.

As far as the scope of the policy is concerned, we believe that the
language policy we are proposing will serve as a guideline for all
Government structures - national, provincial and local - and also for
bodies supported by Government, and, indirectly, the private sector as
well.

Provincial language policy should inform policy decisions taken by local
government. Our strategic goals of policy are to facilitate individual
empowerment and national development by promoting the equitable use of the
official languages, and thus ensuring that all South Africans have the
freedom to exercise their language rights by using the official languages
of their choice in a range of contexts.

We also believe that adequate budgeting must be provided, and we have tried
to do so for this year. We believe that there are special focus areas for
national Government - the Public Service - because effective language
policy is essential for good governance.

Working languages for all Government structures for oral and written
communication, both internal and external, in the Public Service should be
determined, and we are considering this at the moment. As I have said, we
are also considering how external written communication in Government
structures should be determined by the principle of functional
multilingualism or the rotation of languages.

As far as the implementation strategies in the Public Service are
concerned, we are considering and working on a language code of conduct
which will stipulate how public servants are to communicate and interact
with the public. The mere basic greetings at the telephone exchange must
include all the national languages because it is easy, and not a matter of
detail. However, that immediately means that there is full recognition of
the 11 official languages.

Language units in Government departments are being established to deal with
specific language issues of each department - language audits and surveys
to enable Government structures to make informed decisions relating to
language policy and practice, language awareness campaigns to raise
awareness on the role of language in society and to elevate the status of
the previously marginalised languages, and a telephone interpreting service
for South Africa to facilitate access to services and programmes.
As far as the administration of justice and the language of the courts are
concerned, accused persons must be tried in the language of their choice.
The language of record should be the language of the court proceedings.
This obviously has to be flexible, depending on the nature of the court of
jurisdiction. Quite clearly, the Supreme Court will have to include English
as a language of record for international communication.

Court interpreting by professional interpreters, accredited by a regulatory
body, is being established as a course recognised by the South African
Qualifications Authority. As I have referred to education, I think they
have the best opportunities to immediately start initiating equal language
use in terms of providing for the indigenous languages in every province.

This work is ongoing. As soon as we have published and gazetted this, it
will be open to public comment. It will be a long process, quite clearly,
because the issues are emotional and very complex, and we need technology.

We have proposed that in every province there should be a language
development centre, preferably associated with a university, in the area
where there is maximal usage of that particular language. We are also going
to co-operate with universities to establish language museums and language
laboratories, so that there will be high-quality training in language, and
also to establish collections and bibliographies of all the literature in a
particular indigenous language.

This is ongoing work and we need co-operation with hon members. I have been
very impressed by this debate, because the NCOP is serious about this very
fundamental issue. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, we have adopted a practice
here, which is quite unprecedented but which has worked very well, in that
after a subject for discussion which is important to the nation, we
generally try to reach consensus on certain issues. I have in my possession
a draft resolution which I would like to propose to this House for
adoption. With your permission, may I read the resolution, Chairperson?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: You may.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you, Chairperson. I move:


  That the Council -


  (1) recognises that South Africa is a multilingual and multicultural
       nation;


  (2) commits itself to achieving unity through its diversity;


  (3) resolves -


       (a)  that language shall not be used as an instrument of domination,
           as occurred in the past, but as a vehicle for nation-building
           and unity;


       (b)  to endeavour to promote multilingualism through our provincial
           legislatures and local government structures;


       (c)  to convey the contents of this resolution to all relevant
           Ministries such as the Ministers of Education, of Arts, Culture,
           Science and Technology and of Provincial and Local Government;
           and


       (d)  that in the spirit of the Constitution, special regard be had to
           promoting, advancing and protecting multilingualism in our
           institutions wherever reasonably practicable;


  (4) recognises language as an important instrument of development of the
       individual and as a means of freeing the potential of the individual;
       and


  (5) recognises that language, like culture, is not static and evolves,
       and the approach to language policy shall respond to the ever-
       changing circumstances of our people and the demands of economic and
       social empowerment and development of our people.

Chairperson, we have circulated this resolution to the provinces and the
representatives of other political parties. I have not had any adverse
response to it.

I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Minister for enlightening
us on the policy development surrounding this very important issue.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, can I add to what the hon the Chief Whip
of the Council has said, in the spirit of the debate?

Ons het kennis geneem van die resolusie. Ons stem heeltemal daarmee saam en
in die gees van die debat het ons die konsepbesluit in Afrikaans en in
isiXhosa vertaal; dit is beskikbaar. Ek wil dit graag saam met die
konsepbesluit van die Hoofsweep van die Meerderheidsparty in die Raad ter
Tafel lê, en ook die Minister bedank. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[We have taken note of the resolution. We fully agree with it and in the
spirit of the debate we have translated the draft resolution into Afrikaans
and into isiXhosa; it is available. I would like to table this together
with the draft resolution of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party in the
Council and also thank the Minister.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, for information, to whom was this circulated?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, it was circulated to the
provincial Whips as well as the party-political representatives. This was
done this morning. It also emanated as a result of discussions that had
arisen at a previous meeting around this particular issue. But if members
have any difficulties or any different views, they should please put these
on the table. That is no problem.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, we do not have a problem with the motion at all.
We support it entirely, both in Afrikaans and the translation, but we would
have liked to have seen it before we have to agree to this. However, having
said that, we would like to support it very much.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC
            ENTERPRISES - ELIMINATION OF CHILD LABOUR CONVENTION

(Translation of Swati paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, good
afternoon, members of the National Council of Provinces. [Interjections.] I
thought I should speak a bit of siSwati today because of what members were
saying before this debate regarding the importance of speaking in our
indigenous or home languages. I thought I should also say something so that
members know that although I am married to a Xhosa - my husband is from the
Eastern Cape - my mother is a Swazi and my father is from KwaZulu-Natal.]

Chairperson, hon members, I just thought I needed to greet everyone in my
mother tongue, my father tongue and my husband's mother's language in order
to truly reflect the diverse languages that I speak, and I believe I am
truly South African.

I must say that the debate we are having this afternoon really inspired me,
because in a sense it also impacts on the work we are trying to do, namely
the reconstruction of our society.

I think from the discussions it was very clear that indeed our history has
robbed us of so much of who we are, not only in terms of language, but also
in terms of the dispossession of land that the African majority of this
country suffered over many years.

The year 1994 gave us an opportunity to relook at all these matters and see
how we can reconstruct a South Africa that all of us would feel proud of in
many years to come, where the next generation, particularly those who are
our children and who will be our great grandchildren, can look back and
say, ``Indeed, it was a worthwhile struggle for all of us.''

The Land Affairs General Amendment Bill is one of those pieces of
legislation which seek to further strengthen seven principal Acts that have
been passed in the past four years. One may ask why it is necessary to make
these amendments. I think the past five years have taught lessons on where
some of our pieces of legislation have had weaknesses and where they may
not have gone far, but, at the same time, they also give us an opportunity
to further strengthen our land reform programme through our legislation.

Therefore, this Bill, while it is technical in nature, in my view, and the
views of members of this House, will go a long way in enabling us to fast-
track our land delivery programme to those who were previously
disenfranchised.

I must say to the chairperson and members of the committee that the way in
which we have worked with this committee, and with that of the National
Assembly, has given us an opportunity to have insight into some of those
things that probably, as an executive and also as departments, we may not
have paid attention to. I am sure that their relooking at the legislation
has helped to improve our initial work.

I must also indicate that some of the clauses that we seek to amend are
those clauses that, while they were necessary and technical in nature,
revealed an oversight on our part in which we assumed that some of the
consultations may have gone on with all the stakeholders. Indeed, it was
not so.

However, we raised the matter in the National Assembly before we raised it
in the committee, and we reached an understanding that while there may not
be harm in proceeding with the Bill, we would allow those stakeholders to
influence the NCOP where further changes are necessary.

Our view, I must say, in proposing some of those amendments, particularly
those that refer to the extension of security of tenure, was a result of
the practical experiences that we faced when evictions took place. In most
instances, those who were evicted lacked alternative accommodation.
Therefore it should not be seen as advantaging the farmworkers and
disadvantaging the farmers.
I think we are trying to strike a balance by saying that where the need
arises, and evictions may be necessary, it becomes prudent to ensure that
those who are evicted do have alternative accommodation. True to our
Constitution, every man and woman in South Africa does have a right to
accommodation. I think, as Government, it is one of those things that we
have to ensure at all times. While we may not dictate to the courts, we
hope that as they apply this clause when adjudicating, they will take into
consideration the time factor, so that on both sides no one is
disadvantaged by any ruling that is made.

I must therefore say that after the National Assembly debate, my department
interacted further with those stakeholders that we did not interact with
around this clause. Therefore I am pleased to indicate that we were true to
our objective, that is we will continue to ensure that all relevant
stakeholders have been made part of the process of change, in whatever way
possible.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the chairperson of the select
committee of the NCOP, Rev Moatshe, as well as the members of the
committee. The way in which they have worked with us, in ensuring that we
can actually pass this Bill as smoothly as possible, is appreciated. I
therefore present the Bill for adoption by the NCOP. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Minister, we once more congratulate the
Minister on steering the ship throughout to enable our people to access
land from their position of hopelessness. This piece of legislation has far-
reaching implications for all South Africans, especially those who have
been dispossessed of their land. This Bill also covers seven different
Acts, and has been carefully constructed in this fashion to cover the
loopholes that inadvertently hampered the implementation process.

We believe that this Bill will allow the Minister and the Department of
Land Affairs to continue with the good work that they have done to bring
about land restitution to all those who suffered the confiscation of their
land and rights of tenure during the dark days of oppression.

The changes are essentially technical in nature, as the Minister has
already said. Clause 1 amends section 10 of the Deeds Registries Act of
1937. It is recommended that this clause ensure that there are improved
regulations in place to recover the arrears of defaulters, including the
suspension of services to these same defaulters. This amendment
demonstrates that the department is serious about the recovery of debt.

The second clause will effect changes to section 39 of the KwaZulu-Natal
Land Affairs Act of 1992. Here, the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government was
acting in good faith by exercising certain powers and responsibilities.
However, the jury responsibilities were, in fact, delegated in terms of
section 2 of the Land Administration Act of 1995.

This amendment seeks to validate the good faith powers exercised by the
KwaZulu-Natal provincial government. The amendment of section 22 of the
Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994 will now extend the jurisdiction on
who determines the occupier from an exclusive Land Claims Court
jurisdiction to the other courts.

This single amendment immediately releases the burden from the already
overworked Land Claims Court and shares the responsibility of restitution
amongst other courts. Clause 5 allows for the continuity of the Land Claims
Court by giving the judges fixed terms of office. Section 16 of the Land
Reform (Labour Tenants) Act of 1996 needed to have the cut-off date for
applications for land awards extended from March 2000 to 31 March 2001.

The department believes, and the committee concurs, that the full year
extension will allow sufficient time for those people who would otherwise
have lost all their rights to claim ownership of land. Hopefully, there
will be a media campaign that will follow this Bill so that all of our
people, even those in the remote rural areas, can be reached. At the same
time, section 33 of the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act tightens the power
of the court to act swiftly against those illegal occupants who are not
labour tenants.

Section 40 of the above-mentioned Act gives exemption from law governing
subdivision of land to those people with settlement agreements certified by
the director-general of the department and land awarded by court order.
This is a victory for those people whose property was threatened with being
sold off in bits and pieces to unscrupulous developers.

Clause 10 holds special significance. We believe that the Minister and the
department want to go the extra mile with this clause to ensure that there
is full, independent and comprehensive investigation, which includes the
provision of alternative accommodation, before evictions take place. The
independent investigation suggested in this clause will serve as a
recommendation to the court. The further amendment brought by the NCOP
includes that an official from the department or state should be part of
the investigation. Clause 11 seeks to extend the cut-off date for the
automatic review of eviction orders by the Land Claims Court to a date that
will be published in the Gazette.

All in all, this Bill is quite comprehensive. It certainly seeks to make
the lives of our people, who have been robbed of their land, easier. They
now have sufficient time to claim rightful ownership. This Bill also seeks
to get rid of those opportunists who do not hesitate to take advantage of
the law to further their own self-interests. I wish to congratulate the
Minister and the department on this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Madam Chair, the hon the Minister is correct that, largely,
this Bill is of a technical nature and I will concentrate mainly on one
aspect of it.
In the history of our nation, there were many injustices. One of the most
damaging of these injustices was the manner in which the right to have
access to land was controlled and restricted. Far too many of our fellow
citizens still live with the consequences of this injustice. Consequently,
I am sure that all reasonable and right-thinking people would support
practical and sustainable measures to deal with the consequences of this
injustice.

In preparing my speech, I had occasion to consult the speech of my
colleague the hon E K Moorcroft who, when the original Bill was debated in
the Senate in 1996, stated (Hansard, Senate, 1996, col 126):


  I should like to begin by confirming that the DP is fully supportive of
  the overall objectives of the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Bill, which
  are to protect the labour tenants against summary or unjust evictions,
  and to protect the rights of labour tenants particularly in terms of the
  ownership of land.

That was the DP's view then and it remains the DP's view today.

The hon Moorcroft then went on to state:


  This Bill, in short, seeks to do the right thing in the wrong way in what
  can only be described as a singularly undemocratic and nontransparent
  way.

Unfortunately, history seems to repeat itself. When the present Bill was
debated in the NA, my colleague the hon Mr Andries Botha pointed out that
there had not been consultation with one of the key role-players, namely
Agri SA, on certain aspects of the present Bill. Thankfully, the problem
was corrected when the Bill came before the select committee, and I am
grateful to the hon the Minister for acknowledging the oversight and for
her efforts to correct this. Similarly, I am grateful to the department for
the actions that they took in ensuring that the oversight was corrected
before this Bill was debated in this House.

Members will no doubt agree that, generally, more is achieved by
consultation and a genuine attempt to cater for the fears and expectations
of all concerned than can be attained by a prescriptive and exclusionary
approach. The reasons for this are obvious and there is no need for me to
spell them out.
Four years ago, the DP pointed out that the principal Act was an attempt to
do the right thing in the wrong way. Those of us who regularly travel
through small rural towns and villages, and see the exponential growth of
informal settlements on the fringes of these towns and villages, believe
that the hon Mr Moorcroft was correct in his assessment. The fact that we
are here today tinkering with and amending the principal Act is in and of
itself an admission that the principal Act is not having the desired
effect.

Is it not perhaps time to go back to the drawing board and start a process
designed to bring all the role-players together in an attempt to try and
negotiate some form of social contract in which everybody has a stake and a
vested interest in ensuring and seeing that it succeeds? Surely, this sort
of approach will keep agriculture labour intensive and halt or reverse the
trend of investing in capital and machinery to reduce dependence on labour.
This is especially important if one considers the stage of development that
we are at, where jobs are vitally important to economic growth and
stability.

The sceptics amongst us will say that some form of social contract between
labourers and landowners is not possible. They will argue that there is far
too much distrust to allow this to happen. I concede that there is distrust
between the protagonists in this debate, but I wish to say two things to
the sceptics amongst us. Firstly, a representative of the department and a
representative of Agri SA have found common ground on this Bill.

Secondly, we only have to look at how we transformed our politics and our
society in recent history, to realise that there is a pool of goodwill
amongst all communities that has allowed us to get this far. I am not
saying that everything is perfect or that we can now be complacent. What I
am saying is that we have much to be grateful for and we need to
acknowledge, foster and promote this pool of goodwill that exists in all
our communities. In this instance we need to promote relationships of trust
between farm labourers and landowners.

Despite the fact that we feel that there might be a better way to achieve
the objectives of the principal Act, the DP will support this Bill as
amended by the select committee. [Applause.]
Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mevrou die Voorsitter, ek weet dat dit ook gebruik in
hierdie Huis is dat as ons tyd toegedeel is, ons nie alles hoef te gebruik
nie. Ek gaan dus verseker nié my tyd vir die bespreking van die wysigings
van hierdie wette ten volle benut nie, want daar is regtig nie veel om oor
te debatteer nie. Ek wil egter die agb Minister groet, want sedert ons
vorige ontmoeting het haar status in meer as een opsig drasties verander.
Ek groet haar egter bloot met verwysing na haar status as Minister vir
Landbou en Grondsake.

Die Nuwe NP het nog altyd gesê ons is ten gunste van grondhervorming in
Suid-Afrika. Ons sit egter in Suid-Afrika met die probleem dat grondregte
'n emosionele kwessie ook is, nie net 'n materiële kwessie nie. In dié
opsig is daar verwagtinge geskep by baie gemeenskappe ten opsigte van
grondhervorming.

Ons moet vandag eerlik met mekaar wees: daar is aan 'n klomp van die
verwagtinge voldoen, maar daar is 'n klomp projekte en beloftes wat té
stadig tot wasdom kom. Daar is sekere van die grondhervormings wat nie
geslaag het soos dit bedoel is nie. Daar is party van hulle wat heeltemal
misluk het, maar die grootste bekommernis wat ons het, is dat daar sekere
gemeenskappe is wat nou byna ses jaar lank in afwagting leef.

As ek net uit 'n Noord-Kaapse perspektief praat, is daar gemeenskappe soos
Lohatlha, Schmidtsdrif en Bucklands. Ek weet daar is prosesse aan die gang,
en dit is besig om spoedig te verander, maar dan is daar 'n klein
gemeenskappie van 54 boere daar bo in die Kalahari, daar by Mier se wêreld,
wat nou al 'n aantal jare lank probeer om eiendomsreg te kry van die grond
waarop hulle al geslagte lank boer.

Daar is nou 'n hofsaak aan die gang tussen die agb Minister se departement,
die inwoners van Mier en die boere. Dit is 'n onhoudbare situasie. Dit
behoort nie so te wees nie. Ná ses jaar is ek daarvan oortuig dat die
partypolitieke impak wat 'n rol gespeel het by daardie gemeenskap nou baie
afgekoel het. Daarom het ek ook na ons LUR, mnr Thabo Makweya, toe gegaan,
en die saak met hom bespreek. Hy het onderneem om met die Minister 'n
afspraak te maak sodat ons drie met haar daaroor kan praat.

Ek noem dit in die konteks van hierdie wysigings wat die Minister aan die
betrokke wette aanbring. Ons glo dat dit 'n sinvolle bydrae kan lewer om
die totale proses van grondhervorming te versnel.

Ek wil die departement bedank vir die wyse waarop hulle ons gekose komitee
nou die dag behandel en ingelig het, en veral vir die reaksie van die
Minister en haar departement op die voorwaarde van aanvaarding van my
party, naamlik dat die een klousule eers gewysig sal word in oorleg met die
grootste rolspeler in die georganiseerde landbou.

Ek wil die agb Minister daarvoor en ook vir haar gesindheid bedank, en ons
wens haar sterkte toe met hierdie moeilike, verantwoordelike taak wat sy
het ten opsigte van al die mense wat by landbou betrokke is, en al die
mense wat die drome, die versugtinge en die emosionele uitreiking het om
deel daarvan te word. Mag die Minister ook in hierdie tyd van rampe krag en
wysheid kry om te help met uitkoms daar waar dit nodig is.

Ons steun hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp. [Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, I know it is also customary in this House
that if we have been allocated time, we do not have to use all that time.
Therefore I am definitely not going to use all the time allocated to me for
the amendment of these Acts, because there is really not much to debate.
However, I would like to greet the hon the Minister, because since our
previous meeting her status has changed drastically in more than one
respect. However, I am only greeting her with reference to her status as
the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs.

The New NP has always said that we are in favour of land reform in South
Africa. However, we have the problem in South Africa that land rights are
also an emotional issue, and not only a material issue. In this regard
expectations have been created in many communities with regard to land
reform.

We have to be honest with one another today: Many of these expectations
have been met, but there are many projects and promises which are
materialising too slowly. Some of the land reforms have not succeeded as
they were meant to. Some of them have failed completely, but our greatest
concern is that certain communities have been waiting in suspense for
almost six years now.

Speaking from the perspective of the Northern Cape alone, I must mention
communities like Lohatlha, Schmidtsdrif and Bucklands. I know that
processes are under way, and things are changing rapidly, but then there is
a small community consisting of 54 farmers, way up in the Kalahari, in the
vicinity of Mier, who have been trying for a number of years now to acquire
property rights to the land on which they have been farming for
generations.

At present there is a court case in progress between the hon the Minister's
department, the inhabitants of Mier and the farmers. This is an untenable
situation. It should not be like this. I am convinced that, six years down
the line, the party-political fervour which played a role in that community
has cooled down a lot. This is also the reason why I went to our MEC, Mr
Thabo Makweya, and discussed the matter with him. He undertook to make an
appointment with the Minister to enable the three of us to discuss this
matter with her.

I am mentioning this in the context of these amendments that the Minister
is effecting to the relevant Acts. We believe that this can make a
meaningful contribution to expedite the whole process of land reform.
I want to thank the department for the way they treated and briefed our
select committee the other day, and especially for the reaction of the
Minister and her department to my party's precondition for accepting the
Bill, namely that one of the clauses would first be amended in consultation
with the main role-player in organised agriculture.

I want to thank the hon the Minister for that, as well as for her attitude,
and we wish her everything of the best in her difficult, responsible task
in respect of all the people involved in agriculture, and all the people
who dream, aspire and yearn to become part of agriculture. May the Minister
also, in this time of natural disasters, have the strength and the wisdom
to render assistance where it is needed.

We support this amending Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, the department has made a recommendation to
amend certain sections of the Acts that deal with land matters in general.
I think this is a step in the right direction. Amendments were necessary
since the implementation of some of the Acts impacted negatively upon the
people. An example of this is section 2(3) of the Provision of Land and
Assistance Act of 1993, according to which the Minister can designate land
for settlement purposes, while at the same time imposing conditions
regarding the use of the land, one of which usually is that the land must
be held by a legal entity for the benefit of the beneficiaries.

This created unnecessary limitations and prescriptions, which at the end of
the day undermined fundamental human rights. Inhabitants of settlement land
may therefore be prohibited from practising commercial farming in case this
condition is narrow or not expressly permitted.

Farming activities form the main part of the economic activities in our
provinces, particularly in the Northern Province. For this reason,
compounds have been erected in most farms. It is in these compounds where
farm labourers reside as labour tenants rather than as mere occupiers.

We welcome the amendment effected in section 13 of the Land Reform (Labour
Tenants) Act of 1996. Prior to this amendment, rural people, including, of
course, farm labourers, who were regarded as labour tenants, had to utilise
the services of the Land Claims Court, an office which had to attend to
plus-minus 5 000 claims in the Northern Province.

The services of the Land Claims Court have been characterised by several
constraints, eg lack of understanding and inability to complete claim forms
due to illiteracy problems amongst the rural people, hence the emergence of
voluntary services such as iNkunzi in the Northern Province, which is
currently rendering voluntary services in order to assist the people who
are making claims.

Issues such as centralisation of the servicing points, the Land Claims
Court or the Office of the Commissioner for Land Claims, which is only
found in Pretoria, the shortage of adequate complementary staff in the
commissioner's office and travelling costs that accrue in respect of
inspections in loco and interviews are some of the problems we were faced
with.

The granting to magistrates' courts of jurisdiction to hear cases under the
Extension of Security of Tenure Act of 1997 is a step in the right
direction and also rural-friendly for the following reasons.
The magistrates' courts are normally more accessible to the rural people
than the Land Claims Court and commissioner's office. Decentralisation and
sharing with magistrates' courts of the workload formerly entrusted to the
Land Claims Court will really minimise the job and make it easier. Costs
will be reduced since distances to the site inspections in loco or disputed
land will be shorter. Follow-ups by applicants will be easy and affordable
in terms of the costs. The nearer one is to a problem, the better
understanding one will have. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister for Agriculture and Land
Affairs and hon members, it is a pleasure to be involved in this debate,
which is going to bring understanding to many previously disadvantaged
people who suffered a lot during the reign of apartheid in this country.

The IFP supports this Bill and also gives credit to all those who have been
involved in the formulation process of the land amendment Bill of 2000.

Previously disadvantaged citizens will now enjoy the privilege of having
land rights, unlike in the apartheid period, when people were simply
evicted unscrupulously and without any compensation. Very often they were
put into places where even essential infrastructure was lacking. The
saddest and most brutal part was when people were removed from their places
of employment to strange areas without jobs or safe water to drink, and
lacking in health and education facilities.

People were just dumped and expected to see for themselves how they would
survive. It was indeed a horrible state of affairs. This Bill seeks to
correct all these terrible wrongs. This is indeed wonderful.

This Bill seeks to amend seven different Acts which are administered by the
Department of Land Affairs. Clause 1 will amend section 10 of the Deeds
Registries Act of 1937 by permitting a relevant body to make regulations
which will better monitor the recovery of debts owed by service consumers.
This includes suspension of services to defaulters. All the clauses in this
Bill are aimed at promoting the well-being of South African citizens in
order to prevent the abuse of services by consumers and, more importantly,
to prevent the exploitation of consumers by those in power.

[The Bill that is on the Table today will bring about justice and also
protect the rights of the community with regard to the distribution of land
and its administration in our country.
The time for experiencing hardship is over, especially for us, the black
people, as we were moved to and fro in places where we were previously well
off.

The worst of all was that they were moved from their own places and just
dumped wherever the apartheid government had decided. Another one of the
worst scenarios was that they were removed from the places they were born
and bred, and as a result their property was damaged, to such a degree that
they had to leave some of it behind. The places to which they were moved
were mostly deserts, and they were not provided with basic human
necessities for health, like clean water, schools, clinics, roads and many
other public necessities. During these removals they usually suffered from
diseases and their dwelling places were not in a good condition. There was,
for instance, the lack of proper removal of sewage and other things. I
cannot forget the mess that occurred in Lime Hill.

This Bill provides land rights to a person who occupies land and abolishes
the unnecessary removals. People themselves will feel that they have
rights. That alone will liberate the soul. It will prevent the exploitation
of people by those who are in high positions. It will ensure that people
pay for their necessities. If the necessities are not paid for, usually the
right to those necessities is restricted or stopped temporarily. Of course
things become difficult indeed.

This Bill will restore a black person's status as he is the one who was
undermined more than people of other races in South Africa.

Section 5 allows people who were evicted from their land to send
applications for the restoration of their land to them if they so desire.
There are courts which have been set up to deal specifically with the
issue. [Applause.]]

Ms B THOMSON: Comrade Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the
problems of KwaZulu-Natal are largely rural. Land is, as such, one of the
most basic needs of the people of our province.

Since April 1994 this Government has implemented a fundamental land reform
programme in order to redress the inequalities caused by apartheid in land
distribution. Our Government's land reform programme is underpinned by two
equally fundamental concepts, ie redistribution and restitution. Our land
redistribution initiatives include the allocation of vacant Government land
to our people and the strengthening of the property rights of communities
and individuals already occupying land through the Extension Of Security Of
Tenure Act and the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act.

In order to redress the suffering caused by forced removals the Government
enacted the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Individuals and communities who
were dispossessed of their land  rights in terms of racially discriminatory
laws, now have a right to claim restitution against the state by submitting
claims to the Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights.

To date, the commission has processed and concluded many restitution
claims, some of which resulted in the restoration of land to people who
were forcibly removed from their land, while others have been compensated
for the loss of their land rights.

It is impossible to appreciate the challenges facing the land reform
programme without appreciating the profound nature of discrimination that
resulted from the policy of apartheid. The Native Land Act of 1912
prohibited blacks from owning land outside the so-called native reserves
which made up 7% of the country's area. Inside these reserves, an
artificial form of traditional tenure with maximum holding sizes and
restrictions on land transactions was imposed.

Since then, large numbers of black farmers who had legitimately owned land
outside these reserves were dispossessed of their farms, and were forced
into homelands or Bantustans where tenure restrictions, high population
density and the lack of capital and market access made black commercial
agriculture virtually impossible.

The combined effects of all these policies left the new Government with the
unenviable task of reversing a situation in which the average amount of
land per person was 1,3 hectares for blacks compared to 1 570 hectares for
whites.

No process is flawless, least of all a process of fundamental land reform.
In attempting to overcome the legacy of the extremely unequal distribution
of land, we may have overlooked some problems. The Bill that is currently
being debated before this Council is geared towards eradicating some of
these problems. It is an attempt to address some of the shortcomings that
have been identified in existing land reform legislation.

The Bill broadens the jurisdiction of courts to decide on who can be
classified as an occupier, making it easier for people to qualify for
landownership in terms of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act.

The Bill also extends the period within which labour tenants may apply to
acquire land they have used, because many labour tenants may not know about
their rights. This amendment will make it possible for more labour tenants
to acquire land.

It furthermore ensures continuity in the land reform process by allowing
the Minister of Justice to appoint judges of other courts to act as judges
of the Land Claims Court at the expiry of the term of office of the current
judges of the Land Claims Court and subjects the decision of magistrates'
courts relating to the eviction of farm workers to automatic review by the
Land Claims Court.

I have no doubt that the amendments effected to the various pieces of land
reform legislation in terms of this Bill will speed up the process of
eliminating the unequal distribution of land in our country. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon members, I
would like to thank hon members for their participation in this debate.

Most importantly, I think all of us who participated in this debate moved
away from dealing with the more technical issues. I think what hon members
raised were more fundamental issues of policy as well as those of an
administrative nature.

In my view, I think it is one of the issues that we, maybe, will have to
continuously engage with at committee level so that we can further examine
these issues and our understanding of how we can work together in support
of this noble objective that we have set for ourselves.

On the issue raised by Mr Lever, particularly on whether we did not,
through the Bill, do the right thing but in the wrong way, I do appreciate
what he says, but at the same time I think it does need further debate,
particularly if he talks about the social contract.

Are we all having the same attitude and willingness to move beyond our
positions of being an owner or a worker? I think the fundamental issue is
about resolving the tenure question. It may be easier for me, if I am a
landowner, to be able to set parameters of how we would want to negotiate,
but what happens to the landless who are the farmworkers in that
environment? And, where then does the state come in? I think those are the
issues that we need to resolve, because the issues on labour tenancy and
the issue about Esta, which we were trying to resolve regarding these two
Acts, is the vulnerability of those people who stay on farms as workers or
who happen to find themselves on a farm one morning when that was
designated to a Mr Van Wyk or a Mr Botha.

I think the issue is, in the process of redress and reconstruction, how we
deal with those matters with an understanding of our own history as a
country. It requires sensitivity and honesty. It is not going to be an easy
matter because the social contract, for me, would actually have to resolve
the matter of the security of tenure of the landless. How does one deal
with it?

At the same time, we will have to acknowledge the fact of those who are
current owners, some of whom are current owners not in a manner which is
actually transparent. I think we have to face facts and our history without
shame and ask: How then do we all move forward? I do agree that that is the
fundamental debate we need to have.

All of us understood that the Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act, and Esta in
particular, was one of the ways of dealing with the problem in the interim.
As a department we have actually re-examined, and continue to re-examine,
those laws and say how far they go in dealing with the issues that we want
to address.

Hon members will remember that last year during the debate after the
President's opening address in the Assembly, the issue which arose as part
of the programme of the department, and which arose particularly from the
Minister of Housing, was the need for the establishment of the agri-
villages.

They did not come by chance. It was also a way in which we could delink
farmworkers from being dependent, both for labour and accommodation on
farms. But we have not been able to come to some agreement with some of the
members of organised agriculture, because they felt that this would
populate their farming areas and create settlements where they were not
necessary. But I think the question is: How does one create a balance in
ensuring the security of tenure of those people who are discarded as labour
at the age at which they cannot find employment or bonds which they can
access in the banks?

I am saying that this is, in my view, a policy matter, and I would be ready
to debate those matters with members of the select committee so that all of
us could address this matter with the consciousness, as well as the
commitment, of seeking to change our past situation for the better.

Secondly, one of the issues that was raised, particularly by hon member Van
Niekerk, is an issue of an administrative nature. We might have put a very
good objective in terms of the restitution process, but I think the delays
in the way in which those processes have been made have left many
communities uncertain. I have accepted that that has been one of our
realities, but we accept the fact that this was a new programme for all of
us. We need to set up institutions such as the courts and administrative
mechanisms, but the other matters which we are reviewing and which are
going to be contentious - and I think members of this House will have to
deal with them - are in connection with historical valuations. In terms of
our own Constitution, it makes provision for just compensation as well as
ensuring that we take into consideration those who have lost their land as
well as those who were current owners so that they can be justly
compensated.

The compensation at this stage is not given to one party or the other. It
is actually a compensation of both parties, because, as the state, as we
settle the communities, we have to pay and purchase from the current
landowner, and in most instances, the purchase is at market value. I think
this highlights the reality for this Government and the members of
Parliament, which is: Will we be able to manage that cost? At the same
time, the issue of evaluation of communities such as Lohatla, in respect of
the point which the member raised, and many other instances presents
certain problems. Who still has a record of the land value of Lohatla
before it was made a battle school? In most instances, such information is
not in the state archives.

This situation is worse in the rural areas. In the Northern Province, for
instance, in the Madimbo corridor, where people were moved and the army was
put there as a buffer between Zimbabwe and South Africa, nobody can say
what was the historical value of that land at the time. Therefore, one has
to come to some kind of determination which takes a lot of time, and we
have agreed that those processes have to be reviewed. But it means we would
have to reach a balance which will not unnecessarily create other
controversies whereby people may say, ``The so-called `just' compensation
has robbed me of what I have invested in the development of the land.'' I
think it is those tricky questions of policy that we have to appreciate,
but also have to debate as we move forward.

Clearly, the issue of land rights, as the member says, is a very emotive
issue. I have always said that it is, again, an emotive issue on both
sides. If one looks at the current situation in Mpumalanga, we have heard
that organised agriculture in Mpumalanga are seeking to pool their
resources so that they can fight the land claims in court as a unified
force. I think that, in itself, represents the fear and uncertainty in that
part of the community. But sometimes the way in which it is expressed
undermines the appreciation of the other group's problems since they
actually lost their land as a result of the Land Act of 1913 and other
legislation that was put in place.

I think the issue is about, given the route that we have chosen as a
country, how we become committed to what we have set out for ourselves. For
me, it is about reconciliation and looking forward and saying that we all
have a responsibility in ensuring that we deal with our past in a manner
that does not hurt parties on both sides. The hurt will be there, but it is
about how one minimises the hurt so that it is not enormous.

I think the other issue that has been raised by an hon member deals with
the issue of how land reform can be an instrument of resuscitating
agricultural development, particularly among those communities that were
previously dispossessed. It is a matter that we have acknowledged and about
which we have said we will do everything in our power. If one looks at some
of the former homeland areas, certain people were given land to farm
through the SADT land and development aid, but they remained only occupiers
or they had the right to occupy without any ownership. Some of them had
leases which ran for 10 years and after 10 years they were promised an
option to buy, but that never happened. That is a situation we are dealing
with so that we can create certainty.

However, in some of those schemes, in particular, one still has to deal
with the issues of compensation in terms of those communities who were
moved away when such schemes were put in place. The Taung scheme is one
such scheme, where some members of the community who were removed feel they
would want just compensation in the way in which the matter of the farmers
is resolved on this scheme. I am just raising the point for hon members so
that we all have an appreciation of some of the difficulties that we have
to resolve in the process, and how far this Bill will, in some way, help us
to resolve some of those matters. But, obviously, certain issues will
remain for a broader policy discussion amongst ourselves so that when we
take particular steps, it is with the understanding that everybody concurs
on the question of the direction in which we are going. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I rise to clarify a matter that
was raised earlier by Ms Botha. In terms of the resolution that I tabled, I
indicated that it had been circulated to all political parties. It was
suggested by Ms Botha that they did not receive it. I have in my possession
a copy of a fax confirmation sent to Mrs Versveld. My secretary who, in my
opinion, has competently served all political parties has also indicated to
me that she brought this to the attention of Mr Lever, who indicated that
he had only received the speakers' list and that it was not necessary for
her to refax the other documents.

Now I say this in the light of the fact that when we had met as a
multiparty forum, we had specifically raised the issue of the debate and
said that we would prepare a resolution which we could adopt unanimously.
To suggest that they have been omitted somehow, seems to create the
impression that for some unknown reason the DP is being marginalised, and I
thought it important that I place this fact on record. Chairperson, whilst
I am speaking could you ask the kind lady to take her seat because I think
it is unprofessional. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order!
[Interjections.] ... I will give you time. Order! Hon member, I will give
you a chance. If you would sit down, I will give you a chance. You do not
have to rush.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: I would like, for the benefit of the House,
to read the contents of the fax cover, which says the following:


  Please find enclosed the following:


   1. Draft resolution to be made at the end of the discussion on the
       Promotion of Multilingualism in a Democratic South Africa. Please
       advise our offices whether you are in agreement herewith.


   2. Copy of speakers' list for this afternoon's plenary session.


This was sent this morning at 10:33. The number of pages is five and it was
addressed to Mrs Versveld and all other political representatives of the
different political parties. So I am saying that the suggestion that was
made at plenary, namely that they had received no notification, seemed
somewhat extraordinary to me. In any event, if they are in special
difficulties, the political representative of the DP could rise.

I also want to raise the fact that one of the difficulties seems to be that
on one occasion one would find Mrs Versveld appearing at a meeting, and on
another occasion one would have Mr Lever. The attendance by members of the
DP is never consistent and this does not augur well for the spirit of co-
operation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I would not
like to open a debate on a purely administrative matter, because this House
cannot give a ruling on the matter. However, because the Chief Whip has
spoken, I think it would be unfair not to allow Mrs Versveld to say
something. I do not know what it is that you wish to say.

Mrs A M VERSVELD: Chairperson, up to now I wanted to ask at what time that
fax was sent. [Interjections.] Up to now - up to 13:00 this afternoon -
there was nothing in my pigeonhole, and I stand by that. It is a pity that
other things have been brought up here that should have been discussed in
the multiparty Whips' meeting. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Thank you, hon
member. That is why I say that I do not want to engage this House in purely
administrative matters. That should be discussed at the level of the Whips.

  CHIROPRACTORS, HOMEOPATHS AND ALLIED HEALTH SERVICE PROFESSIONS AMENDMENT
                                    BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I am advised
that there will be a short statement by the hon member L Jacobus.

Ms L JACOBUS: Deputy Chairperson, I am being harassed by my colleagues on
that side of the House. Because the amendment before us today is largely of
a technical nature, we have agreed as a select committee that we will not
be having a debate on the matter, but I will table a report on behalf of
the committee and also make a few comments so that members understand what
it is that they are voting on.

Having said that, I will proceed. In February 1996 the Chiropractors,
Homeopaths and Allied Health Service Professions Interim Council was
established to replace the old council by the then Minister of Health,
Nkosazana Zuma. The main objective of this interim council was to make
recommendations to the Minister of Health on the constitution of the new
permanent council still to be established.

The interim council was established for a period of 36 months, and this
period expired in February 1999 before the permanent council could be
established. However, the department accepted responsibility for the delay
in extending the term of office of the interim council. The reason given
for the omission was that the department was drafting a general amendment
to the principal Act on the basis of recommendations received by the health
portfolio committee on the structure of the proposed permanent council.

This process, we were told, took longer to finalise than initially
envisaged. We have had lengthy discussions. We have held two joint meetings
with the portfolio committee at which we interrogated the department
thoroughly on the matter and were satisfied by the responses that we got.

The Bill, when passed, will apply retrospectively as of February 1999. We
consulted the state law adviser, who is of the opinion that the
retrospective application is not unconstitutional since the proposed
amendments do not violate any individual's or group of individuals'
constitutional rights. The Bill consists of three clauses, with the
following provisions. Clause 1 amends the timeframe within which the
council has to discharge its mandate from 36 months to 60 months, clause 2
seeks to amend the term of office of the interim council accordingly, and
clause 3 provides for the retrospectivity of the extension of the term of
office of this interim council.

If I may, I will now briefly proceed to read the committee's report for
adoption, hopefully by the House.


  The Select Committee on Social Services, having considered the subject of
  the Chiropractors, Homeopaths and Allied Health Service Professions
  Amendment Bill [B2-2000] (National Council of Provinces - sec 76)
  referred to it and classified by the JTM as a section 76 Bill, reports
  the Bill without amendment.

I must say in the select committee all provinces supported the amendments
as well. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                   MOTIONS

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Before I
adjourn this House, I want to dispose of a small matter regarding motions
which was raised this morning. I had the opportunity to study the two
motions which were tabled by Mr Sulliman and Dr Conroy and I am satisfied
that the two motions are exactly the same and express the same sentiments,

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Chairperson:


     The following correspondence has been received from the President
     regarding communication between his Office and the the World
     Association of Newspapers concerning the South African Human Rights
     Commission's hearing on racism in the media:


     (1)    His Excellency Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki
         President
         Office of the President, Private Bag X1000
         Union Buildings, Government Avenue
         0001 Pretoria
         South Africa


         21 February 2000


         Your Excellency,
         We are writing on behalf of the World Association of Newspapers
         and the World Editors Forum, which represent more than 17,000
         publications in 93 countries, to express our serious concern that
         at least six editors and an unknown number of other journalists
         have been subpoenaed by the South African Human Rights Commission
         (SAHRC) to appear at its hearings into "racism in the media" early
         next month.


         The editors of the Sunday Times, The Mail and Guardian, Die
         Burger, Cape Times, Cape Argus, the magazine You and
         representatives of 24 other news organisations have been ordered
         to appear at Braamfontein counsel chambers in Johannesburg in
         order to "testify on (their) product's policies and guidelines on
         the reporting of and commenting on national and international
         events which impact on racism response", under threat of a fine or
         jail sentence of six months if they refuse.


         WAN has from the outset opposed the Commission's initiative (see
         copy, attached, of our January 1999 letter to President Mandela);
         we now find many of our worst fears and objections to this process
         reinforced.


         The SAHRC's Interim Report (November 1999) contains numerous
         alarming examples of the arbitrary interpretation of what might or
         might not constitute racism. Indeed, the researcher who compiled
         the report rightly conceded in her preface: "Drawing legal
         conclusions would be well beyond the scope of the research brief
         and my own professional competence. The analysis is clearly highly
         selective".


         We maintain that the question of racism should be confronted
         within the framework of any existing legal provisions which apply
         to all citizens of society, and that specific measures applicable
         only to the media are an infringement of press freedom. We believe
         that a Commission of Inquiry into the media with the powers of
         "search, seizure and arrest" is a wholly inappropriate body to
         deal with such issues and a very real threat to freedom of
         expression and editorial independence.


         We respectfully call on you to urgently reconsider the mandate and
         powers given to this Government-sponsored, though "independent"
         inquiry, and to have the subpoenas addressed to editors and other
         media representatives withdrawn before any further damage is
         caused to South Africa's image in the international community.


         I look forward to receiving your comments on these cases.


         Yours sincerely,




         (Signed)      (Signed)

     (2)    24 February 2000


         The President
         World Association of Newspapers
         25, rue d'Astorg
         75008 Paris
         FRANCE


         Dear Mr Braun


         We acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 21 February 2000
         addressed to the President.


         We will bring the letter to the attention of the President.


         In the meantime, I thought it appropriate that I correct some
         misconceptions you might have about the status of the Human Rights
         Commission.


         The Human Rights Commission is an institution created by our
         Constitution as one of the bodies supporting democracy. The
         Commission is independent of Government and is accountable only to
         Parliament.


         The Government, therefore, has no control over the actions of the
         Commission. Our Constitution states quite clearly that "No person
         or organ of State may interfere with the functioning of these
         institutions".


         Members of the Government have themselves, on past occasions,
         appeared before the Human Rights Commission under subpoena.


         We recognise the Constitutional right of the Commission to
         exercise its powers without interference from any person. Hence
         the Government has accepted the powers of the Commission to
         subpoena members of the Government.


         The Government did not "sponsor" the inquiry into racism in the
         media as suggested in your letter. You may have been informed that
         the Human Rights Commission will be hosting a conference on racism
         later this year, hence your confusion. The conference is not
         related to the inquiry by the Commission, which inquiry was
         initiated long before the decision on the conference was taken.


         Not being a party to the proceedings, we do not understand the
         legal and constitutional basis upon which the objection to the
         subpoenas is based.


         We also do not understand in what manner is the inquiry a threat
         to the constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression.


         Yours sincerely


         (Signed)
         MOJANKU GUMBI
         LEGAL ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT




     (3)    February 26, 2000


         Dear Mr Braun and Ms de Aquino,


         Presumably, you have received the February 24 response of my Legal
         Advisor, Advocate Gumbi, to your letter dated February 21.


         I agree fully with the observations contained in her letter.


         You are well aware of the catastrophe imposed on our people by
         over three hundred years of racism, starting with the virtually
         genocidal annihilation of the Khoi and San people whom the
         European settlers found at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th
         Century.


         Consequently, the post-World War II apartheid system in our
         country was but a brutal refinement and further entrenchment of
         the racial and racist oppression and exploitation of the black
         majority by the descendants of these and later European settlers
         during the previous three centuries.


         As you will understand, the elimination of racism in our country
         is central to the enhancement and protection of the human rights
         of the overwhelming majority of our people.


         It is obvious that the legacy of the scourge of racism, which has,
         over the centuries, claimed countless black lives and resulted in
         massive human degradation, which continues to this day, could not
         have been wiped out in the short period since we achieved our
         freedom in 1994.


         A South African Human Rights Commission would therefore be in
         grave default if it did not concern itself with a human rights
         matter as critically important to our people as racism.


         For this reason, as indicated by Advocate Gumbi, our Human Rights
         Commission (HRC) will be hosting a National Conference against
         Racism later this year.


         Again as she reported, we will be happy to host the UN World
         Conference on Racism next year.


         Many of our independent Constitutional Commissions, including the
         HRC, investigate various matters on the basis of complaints lodged
         with them by members of the public.


         To the best of my knowledge, the HRC instituted its investigation
         of racism in the media as a result of complaints lodged by such
         members of the South African public. You can verify this for
         yourselves.


         I therefore find it strange and disturbing that you describe the
         HRC inquiry as --"Government-sponsored".


         This is particularly so given that we assumed that the positions
         you hold guaranteed that you would represent the best in
         journalism, including respect for the truth and aversion to
         propaganda.


         In this context, I must make the point that our Government has not
         and will not make any determination with regard to the merits or
         demerits of the HRC inquiry into racism in the media.


         Like the majority of South Africans, we await the outcome of this
         inquiry.


         As Advocate Gumbi indicated, ours is a constitutional democracy.


         It is therefore a matter of serious concern to me that the World
         Association of Newspapers and the World Editors Forum suggest that
         our Government should violate the Constitution.


         You urge that we should commit a serious illegal act by destroying
         the constitutionally guaranteed independence of the HRC.


         This we will not do, in the interest of democracy in our country,
         respect for the Constitution and the entrenchment of the rule of
         law.


         We ourselves negotiated and approved the Constitution to which we
         refer and are therefore committed to the objectives it spells out
         in black and white.


         Among other things, this Constitution, which is supported by all
         South Africans, directs that we should transform ours into a non-
         racial society.
         It also guarantees the freedom of expression and editorial
         independence to which you refer.


         As a Government, we are committed to both of these constitutional
         objectives and will not consciously or deliberately seek to
         undermine or compromise them.


         You propose that any possible racism in the media `should be
         confronted within the framework of any existing legal provisions
         which apply to all citizens of society'.


         Undoubtedly, if our country's law enforcement agencies felt that
         anybody, including the media, was acting in violation of the law
         with regard to the issue of racism, they would take the kind of
         action you propose.


         The HRC is not one of these law enforcement agencies and can only
         act in a manner that is consistent with its constitutional and
         legal possibilities and mandate.


         In the event that the HRC acts outside of this mandate, any
         aggrieved person has the possibility of recourse to our ordinary
         courts as well as the Constitutional Court.


         If the South African editors, to whom you refer, feel that their
         freedom of expression and editorial independence are threatened by
         the HRC hearings, they are free to resort to these courts in
         defence of what are constitutionally protected rights.


         Your appeal to us to intervene in this matter is both dangerous
         and misplaced.


         It is precisely the kind of initiative you propose we should take
         that would damage the image of our Government and country in the
         eyes of both of our own people and the international community.


         I trust that you too will agree with me that there can be nothing
         honourable in undermining the struggle against racism and
         compromising our respect for the Constitution and the law.


         If you disagree with what both Advocate Gumbi and I have said, you
         are free to petition both our Human Rights Commission and our
         courts.


         I would like to assure you that, like yourselves, we too are
         committed to the defence of freedom of expression and editorial
         independence.


         If you care to study the history of the media in South Africa,
         especially during the apartheid years, you will see how the regime
         of racism worked systematically to destroy the media and the media
         workers committed to the liberation of our people.


         Accordingly, our own very painful history teaches us that freedom
         of expression is fundamental to our own liberty.


         This also means that we are happy to encourage everybody else to
         be vigilant against any regression on this issue on the part of
         any Government in our country, including our own.


         We say all this because we waged a hard and protracted struggle to
         achieve the ojectives of freedom of expression and press freedom,
         during which many lives were lost and many people suffered in
         prison and in exile.


         The freedom we have achieved gives us the possibility further to
         protect and advance these freedoms.


         It was for this reason that we sought that they should be
         constitutionally guaranteed and not subjected to the vagaries of
         parliamentary democracy, however democratically elected these
         parliaments, and the attendant executive authorities, might be.


         Like Advocate Gumbi, perhaps because we are not party to the HRC
         proceedings, I do not understand in what manner the inquiry into
         racism in the media constitutes a threat to the constitutionally
         protected right to freedom of expression.


         Yours sincerely,




         (Signed)
         THABO MBEKI

                           THURSDAY, 2 MARCH 2000

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:
     (1)    The following Bill was introduced in the National Assembly on 2
         March 2000 and referred to the Joint Tagging Mechanism (JTM) for
         classification in terms of Joint Rule 160:


         (i)     Competition Amendment Bill [B 10 - 2000] (National
              Assembly - sec 75) - (Portfolio Committee on Trade and
              Industry - National Assembly) [Explanatory summary of Bill and
              prior notice of its introduction published in Government
              Gazette No 20903 of 17 February 2000.]


     (2)    The Minister of Communications on 2 March 2000 submitted a draft
         of the South African Communications Regulatory Authority Bill,
         2000, and the memorandum explaining the objects of the proposed
         legislation, to the Speaker and the Chairperson in terms of Joint
         Rule 159. The draft has been referred by the Speaker and the
         Chairperson to the Portfolio Committee on Communications and the
         Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises, respectively,
         in accordance with Joint Rule 159(2).

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Finance on the South African
     Airways Unallocatable Debt Bill [B 1 - 2000] (National Assembly - sec
     75), dated 1 March 2000:


         The Select Committee on Finance, having considered the subject of
         the South African Airways Unallocatable Debt Bill [B 1 - 2000]
         (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and classified by the
         JTM as a section 75 Bill, reports that it has agreed to the Bill.


         The Committee approved the Bill on the understanding that it is
         implicit from the provisions of Clause 2 that the money that the
         Minister of Finance is being authorised to borrow, will not be
         paid into the National Revenue Fund and that, therefore, the Bill
         is not a Money Bill.


         In view of the peremptory provisions of section 213(1) of the
         Constitution, the Committee recommends that in future a Bill that
         seeks to provide that money received by the National Government
         not be paid into the National Revenue Fund, should contain a
         specific provision to that effect.
