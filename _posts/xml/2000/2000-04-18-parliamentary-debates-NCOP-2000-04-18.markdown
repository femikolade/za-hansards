                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr J L THERON: Mev die Voorsitter, by die volgende sitting van die Raad
sal ek voorstel:


  Dat die Raad die Minister van Buitelandse Sake versoek om -


  (1) 'n verklaring uit te reik om Suid-Afrikaners in Zimbabwe gerus te
       stel;


  (2) planne aan te kondig om aan te toon dat Suid-Afrikaners huis toe
       gebring sal word indien die anargiesituasie in Zimbabwe eskaleer; en


  (3) aan te toon watter stappe die Regering doen om die situasie in
       Zimbabwe, wat uurliks versleg, te beredder.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Madam Chairperson, at the next sitting of the Council I
shall move:


  That the Council requests the Minister of Foreign Affairs to -


  (1) issue a statement to reassure South Africans in Zimbabwe;


  (2) announce plans to indicate that South Africans will be brought home
       if the anarchic situation in Zimbabwe escalates; and


  (3) indicate what steps the Government is taking to deal with the
       situation in Zimbabwe, which is deteriorating by the hour.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mev die Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) die President van Suid-Afrika inlig oor die ophoping van restitusie-
       eise wat nie afgehandel word nie en die gepaardgaande onsekerheid wat
       daardeur geskep word;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP dit as onbillik beskou teenoor
       die eisers en die huidige privaateienaars van die grond;
  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat die onafgehandelde eise 'n ekonomiese demper
       plaas op die landbou, wat uitbreiding en werkskepping aan bande lê;
       en


  (4) erken dat die onvervulde verwagtinge wat ten opsigte van
       grondherverdeling geskep is, frustrasie in die hand werk en die
       gevaar skep dat dit ook soos in Zimbabwe handuit kan ruk en die reg
       op privaateiendom kan aantas.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chairperson, I give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) informs the President of South Africa about the mass of restitution
       claims that are not being finalised and the accompanying uncertainty
       this is creating;


  (2) notes that the New NP regards this as unfair towards the claimants
       and the current private landowners;


  (3) notes that the unfinalised claims are putting an economic damper on
       agriculture, which is restricting development and job creation; and


  (4) admits that the unfulfilled expectations which have been created in
       respect of land restitution are promoting frustration and creating
       the danger of getting out of control, just as in Zimbabwe, and could
       affect the right to private property.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I wish to give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses grave concern at the high number of South Africans who work
       to live and to support their families and who lose their lives
       unnecessarily through merciless taxi-related killings;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  the ambush of a taxi in Kranskop last week left all occupants
           dead;
       (b)  the sporadic eruptions are manifested in various areas almost in
           all provinces; and


       (c)  the recent taxi war in the Western Cape between taxi operators
           and the Golden Arrow Bus Service is not an exception; and


  (3) requests the Minister of Transport to institute extra control
       measures to prevent the escalation of violence in the taxi industry.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting
of the Council I will move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the admission by the Minister for Safety and Security that the
           SA Police Service is experiencing shortages at provincial and
           national level of trained personnel, equipment, vehicles and
           other logistical support, which hamper them in their task to
           prevent and combat crime in all nine provinces in South Africa;


       (b)  that the total number of the shortages in trained personnel
           spread across all provinces is 7 000;


       (c)  that the total number of the shortages in vehicles spread across
           all provinces is 7 860;


       (d)  that the total amount of the budget needed to address the
           shortages of personnel, vehicles, computer networks and general
           equipment is R928 million;


       (e)  that the Government only intends to increase the number of
           personnel in the SAPS over the next four to five years by
           increasing the number of personnel by 7 000, most of whom will
           be entry-level personnel, and that the shortages in vehicles and
           other equipment will only be addressed over the next three to
           four years; and


       (f)  that in the light of the present totally unacceptable high
           levels of crime in our country, the said situation and the
           Government's intentions only to address the said shortages over
           periods of three to five and three to four years are not
           acceptable to this Council; and


  (2) resolves that the safety and security of all our citizens, and
       therefore the fight against crime, should be regarded as the
       Government's most fundamental duty and highest priority and that the
       Government should make the R928 million required to address the said
       shortages available to the SAPS immediately.

       op te los;

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Madam Chair, I move:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Premier and the government of the Western Cape on
       the Golden Arrow and Golden Star awards which they received;
  (2) notes that the Golden Arrow award to the Premier, Mr Morkel, was made
       by a panel of 42 economists, investment analysts and business leaders
       because his province's achievements showed the greatest increase;


  (3) also notes that the aforementioned panel named the Western Cape as
       the province which has done the most to solve problems of

       many families who lost loved ones through road accidents;

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates two great non-American golfers, Vijay Singh of Fiji and
       Ernie Els of South Africa, on coming first and second in the
       prestigious US Masters Golf Tournament which was held at the famous

  (2) acknowledges that to beat the world's best golfers and especially the
       much-vaunted Americans in their own backyard is no mean achievement;
       and


  (3) notes with gratification that the victor in this great tournament was
       a golfer of colour from the seemingly unknown island of Fiji, which
       is a source of great inspiration to all disadvantaged golfers all
       over the world.


  What a victory! Not only for Vijay Singh but a great triumph for the
  sport itself - golf is indeed the ultimate winner. We celebrate!

  (1) notes that the institution of traditional leadership was never
       accorded pride of place in the systems of apartheid governance;


  (2) also notes the recent launching of a draft discussion document
       towards a White Paper on Traditional Leadership and Institutions;

  (4) wishes to congratulate the Minister for Provincial and Local

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die geweldige verliese wat gister op die
       Johannesburgse Effektebeurs gely is ná die dramatiese val in die
       pryse van veral inligtingstegnologie-aandele en in reaksie op

       technology shares in particular, and in response to similar
       happenings, especially in the USA;

       result of this; and

       and power of recovery of the South African economy, which enables it
       to process and overcome setbacks of this nature.]

Motion, as amended, agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the

                      OPERATION OF INSIDER TRADING ACT

       (e)  these funds have been used to cover the costs of the

 APPOINTMENT OF BONGANI KHUMALO TO HEAD THE GOVERNMENT'S HIV/AIDS AND RURAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C S BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

       head the Government's HIV/Aids and rural development strategies;


  (2) further notes that these important issues have been embroiled in, and

       with both issues has had a multiplying effect, daily exacerbating the
       impact of both;


  (3) acknowledges that with this move, the President's office has
       appointed a person as administrator and manager with a proven track
       record in the field of practical delivery; and

       AMENDMENT OF RESOLUTION ADOPTING REPORT ON OPEN DEMOCRACY BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the draft resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:
  That, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly, the resolution
  of the Council of 27 January 2000 adopting the Report of the Ad hoc Joint
  Committee on Open Democracy Bill on the Open Democracy Bill  [B 67 - 98]
  (Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports, p 15) be amended as
  follows:


  That -


  (1) the Report be adopted, except that -


       (a)  with reference to paragraph 7 of the Report, the Department of
           Justice and Constitutional Development report back to Parliament
           (rather than to ``the Committee'') on the feasibility of
           establishing an enforcement mechanism like the Information
           Commissioner; and


       (b)  with reference to paragraph 9 of the Report, the Council notes
           that the task of redrafting the chapter on whistle blower
           protection, which was omitted from the bill presented to the
           Houses by the ad hoc joint committee, has been assigned by the
           National Assembly to the National Assembly Portfolio Committee
           on Justice and Constitutional Development, the Committee to
           present the redrafted chapter as a separate bill; and


  (2) the Ad hoc Joint Committee on Open Democracy Bill is accordingly
       dissolved.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PRECEDENCE TO ORDER OF THE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I would like to move without
notice that item no 3 on the Order Paper, that is, the Independent
Communications Authority of South Africa Bill, be given precedence and that
it be dealt with immediately after the first item. The reason is that
Minister Kader Asmal is going to introduce item no 3, and I have made this
particular request for his convenience.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of Policy)

Vote No 8: Education:

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members and delegates, this is
my first report to the NCOP on my stewardship of the Department of
Education.

On the Order Paper it is written that this is a review of my policy. I
will, of course, be looking at the relationship between the central
department and the provinces. The details of the policy will be found in
our annual report published a few weeks ago.

However, I wish to begin by acknowledging with great pleasure the
appointment of the Chairperson, Ms Naledi Pandor, to the high honour of
Chancellorship of the Cape Technikon. I would also like to acknowledge the
passion and dedication she has brought to the role of chairperson of the
Tertiary Education Fund of SA, which administers the national student
financial aid scheme.

It has been the custom for this debate to focus on the condition of the
provincial education systems, even though Vote 8 is the budgetary
appropriation for the national Education department. In fact, almost all of
it represents transfer payments to the higher education system, which is an
exclusive competence of the national level of government. However, I invite
members of the House to raise higher education issues when the appropriate
occasion arises.

When I introduced the education debate in the National Assembly on 14 March
2000, I remarked that Vote 8 contains no funds to support provincial
education systems, other than conditional grants to assist provincial
education departments to carry forward innovative work in capacity-building
and quality improvement. In fact, the massive appropriations for provincial
education - up to R43 billion - are made by provincial legislatures out of
the funds voted to them in the block grants to provinces.

I noted the disjunction between the political responsibility of the
Minister of Education for the state of education throughout the country,
and the fact that the Minister does not control, or even influence,
provincial allocations of resources for education. I then observed that I
am closing this gap, not with a constitutional amendment, but with a
vigorous interpretation of the constitutional doctrine of co-operative
government, which seemed to have raised some alarm after my speech in the
National Assembly.

It is an unquestionable fact of our national life that the Minister of
Education carries the political burden of responsibility for the welfare of
the entire national system of education. It is an indisputable consequence
of our constitutional arrangements that the Minister of Education controls
no provincial education budgets and disposes of no executive power with
respect to provincial education. In brief, I have no lawful authority to
order any provincial officer to do anything whatsoever.

The President and his Cabinet carry executive responsibility for every
matter of national interest. The provincial governments are required to
execute national legislation, policy and frameworks that advance the
national interest. The national Government is obliged to assist each
provincial government.

Therefore, to apply a vigorous interpretation of co-operative government
means that I undertake: firstly, to assist my provincial colleagues in
whatever way my department and I can devise; secondly, to monitor the
performance of provincial education departments in fulfilling their
constitutional duties, carrying out national policy and achieving agreed
performance targets; thirdly, to call my provincial colleagues to account;
and fourthly, to exert every ounce of political authority I possess in
order to extend educational opportunity to all our people and to improve
the quality of learning throughout our system.

The Council of Education Ministers - in keeping with the lofty role of
education, we do not have MECs when they meet together -with an almost
entirely new cast of members, has had the cobwebs shaken out of it, and is
now functioning as an invaluable, lively, interactive forum for political
debate, mutual support, mutual correction and executive decision-making.

MECs for education and I have made numerous highly visible visits to
schools to monitor performance on the first day of term, to expose cases of
notorious abuse and neglect, and to praise and encourage educators and
learners who are succeeding even under conditions of serious adversity.

We are collectively determined to ensure that the management and staff of
every school, college and learning centre in the country are held to the
highest standards of professional delivery. The organised teaching
profession and the South African Council for Educators are indispensable
allies in these endeavours. A Bill to provide for the establishment of the
council and to formalise its work will come before Parliament during the
current session, and will be introduced first in the NCOP.

My provincial colleagues are collaborating in an important monitoring
exercise. With their help, in November last year, I delivered my first
report to the President on provincial education and, at the President's
invitation, I made a presentation on this matter to the premiers. I hope
hon members and delegates will have seen the executive summary in my
department's 1999 annual report.

This month I delivered my second report on provincial education to the
President, and yesterday I placed a copy of this voluminous report on the
performance of provinces in the parliamentary library. This is a
comprehensive document covering no less than seven themes, which are: the
timely opening of schools in January this year; the implementation of
Curriculum 2005 in Grades 3 and 7 this year; preparations for the year 2000
senior certificate examinations and their publication on a single date
throughout South Africa; progress with the procurement of learning support
materials for the 2001 school year; planning for the implementation of the
national Tirisano programmes; provincial budget processes and the
implementation of national funding policy; the implementation of provincial
responsibilities under the SA Schools Act of 1996; and, finally, the early
filling of senior posts, and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings.

So, having laid a solid foundation with the first two reports, I intend
that subsequent reports should focus on fewer themes and be much more
sharply evaluative of performance in the provinces. Mere facts, however
voluminous, do not tell the story we need to hear, and of course, the real
story of education, apart from higher education, happens in the provinces.

I have tried to convey to hon members that there is a serious engagement
under way to help build the sinews of an effective provincial system of
education. This effort is collaborative. It is driven by the political
leadership and it depends on co-operative work between the professionals of
the national and provincial departments of education. It is also
supplemented, I may say, by the professional resources of a large number of
academic and nongovernmental organisations and agencies whose work is
financed both on budget and by the continued welcome support of our
international and local funding partners. I should say that without the
assistance of these agencies and NGOs, much of our work would not be
carried out.

Since July last year, when I published my Call to Action, I have insisted
that we cannot do everything at once. It is essential to prioritise and,
within priorities, to set targets. My main priorities have been translated
into an action programme for the period January 2000 to December 2004 under
the watchword Tirisano - working together. This phrase perfectly captures
both the spirit of co-operative government and the need for the
mobilisation of all the creative forces in society in support of our
education project. Deputy President Jacob Zuma launched our Tirisano
implementation plan - which is available, again, in the library - in
January this year, and the details were published in our 1999 annual
report. Each province has since then drawn up a plan for Tirisano that
reflects its particular needs and style of operation.

Provincial action on education priorities is being undertaken within a
budgetary context, but is still exceptionally difficult. The total outlay
on provincial education from the national equitable share has reached R43
billion in this financial year, close to 40% of total provincial budgets.
However, on perusing the actual allocation by the provinces, only R42
billion was actually allocated to education. So R1 billion out of the
equitable share made by the national exchequer was transferred to other
uses.

Provincial budget management has been a major project of the national and
provincial departments of education, in collaboration with their
counterparts in Finance. The painful process of correcting the extremely
high, largely unbudgeted increases in education spending in 1996-97 is
still an important factor in the budget process of most provinces. The
dramatic increase in the baseline of education expenditure in that year was
not sustainable because, in fact, there was a 24% increase for education in
that year. Consequently, there has been a real annual decline in total
education expenditure from 1996-97 to 1999-2000, although I should say that
the total allocation for education still constitutes 21% of the national
Budget.

Personnel costs represent by far the largest proportion of education
spending, and the cost of educators, as distinct from public servants, is
by far the largest factor in personnel spending. Thanks to the agreements
reached in June 1998, between the Minister of Education and the three
national teachers' unions, the management of the educator cost has been
brought under strict control.

The key factors in this process have been a nationally agreed system of
norms to guide the allocation of teachers to schools and a sophisticated
process of rationalisation and redeployment that has been undertaken
through collaboration between the national and provincial departments and
the teachers' unions.

In most provinces, particularly in the largest, poorest and most rural
provinces, personnel spending continues to crowd out nonpersonnel spending
to an unacceptable degree. These provinces inherited inefficient school
systems with very high failure rates and large numbers of repeaters, major
backlogs of school buildings and services; especially, I regret to say,
water and sanitation; but also electricity and telephones, and inadequate
teaching and learning resources, lack of libraries and equipment. This is
our enormous legacy. Provincial education departments whose governments
were placed under section-100 conditions by the Minister of Finance have
had to accept close central control by provincial treasuries and to
contribute towards the elimination of provincial overdrafts.

Under such conditions, it must again be acknowledged that the education
budgets of the poorest and most rural provinces are not yet educationally
credible. The phrase was introduced by the 1998 MTEF Education Sector
Review Team. What it means is that, even under optimal management
conditions, the budgeted allocations to most provincial education
departments are wholly inadequate to provide for the essential education
services for which they are responsible.

I want to make two comments on this situation. Firstly, the efforts to
improve the quality of education spending must continue. This is essential
to ensure that waste and inefficiency are reduced and funds are directed
properly to where the needs are greatest. This involves capacity building
and improving management systems in provincial departments through the
professional partnership, including technical support, between the national
and provincial education departments on the one hand, and the Education and
Finance departments on the other. A large part of the conditional grant of
R272 million this year will continue to support this joint work, or the
building up of capacity together with the invaluable support of external
agencies.

Secondly, I am all too aware that our Constitution places an unmistakable
duty upon the state and upon this Government to protect and fulfil the
right of everyone to basic education, including adult basic education. The
language of the Constitution is unambiguous. This right is not qualified by
considerations of progressive availability of resources or other reasonable
impediments.

I am attempting to address this matter on a number of fronts. Firstly, the
Department of Education is engaged in consultation with the Department of
Finance and the Financial and Fiscal Commission to explore what changes
could be effected to the weightings of variables in the revenue-sharing
formula. The objective is to achieve a more equitable division of revenue
for the poorest provinces with the most serious inherited needs.

Secondly, my department has produced a persuasive video that was shown to
the Cabinet a few months ago, together with a presentation on the appalling
state of school buildings and services in the poorest rural areas of our
country. As a result, my department has Cabinet authority to establish, as
a matter of urgency, a technical capacity for physical planning.

This will enable the department to work more effectively with the
appropriate state departments, parastatal agencies and the provinces to
improve our national data base and geographic information system on school
facilities, to draw up a national plan and priority programme for school
buildings and services, and to establish relevant and cost-effective norms
and standards.

Thirdly, White Papers on Early Childhood Development and on Special Needs
Education are at an advanced stage of preparation. These long-awaited
policy documents - too long awaited, I must say - will be presented for
Cabinet consideration within the next few weeks.

Fourthly, the National Literacy Agency is finishing the design stage. When
established, this vital new national institution will spearhead the
national campaign for literacy and numeracy. The campaign will be the major
vehicle for delivering access to the first stage of basic education for
millions of illiterate South Africans whose fundamental right to learning
has, up to now, been denied them.

Literacy and numeracy are the first steps towards a complete basic
education as envisaged by our Constitution. The Adult General Education and
Training Bill has been published for comment and will be considered this
year by Parliament. I should also add that in the past month I have
published a Bill to provide for quality assurance in general and further
education and training, including the establishment of a quality assurance
council, as well as Bills to provide amendments to various other pieces of
education legislation, including the Higher Education Act.

I want to refer to changes that are occurring in the provision of teacher
education. Over the past six years the future of teacher colleges, which
are still under provincial control, has been subjected to a protracted
process of investigation and planning. In 1994 we inherited approximately
150 institutions providing teacher education to about 200 000 students, of
whom about 80 000 were enrolled in colleges of education.

Many teacher colleges have been established by homeland and so-called
independent states without consideration, of course, of need or quality.
Many more were no more than vocational high schools by another name. The
per student cost in these teacher colleges well exceeded the per student
cost in universities. This situation was impossible. In 1996 the Council of
Education Ministers decided to embark on a programme of rationalisation as
a precursor to the incorporation of the remaining viable colleges into
higher education.

By this year the number of teacher colleges had been reduced to 50 with
20 000 students, out of a total of 82 public institutions offering teacher
education to 115 000 students. Of these, about 20 000 are enrolled in
preservice programmes and 95 000 in in-service programmes.

Once the provincial rationalisation process is completed, 25 earmarked
contact colleges of education will have about 15 000 students, and two
distance education colleges will enrol another 5 000, measured as full-time
equivalents.

In the course of the planning process it became clear that no public
college of education can survive as an independent institution within the
higher education sector. Therefore all surviving colleges will be
incorporated into universities and technikons respectively. I have already
announced the first wave of incorporations of colleges of education into
universities and technikons. I intend to announce the second wave of
incorporations as soon as agreements with the parties are complete.

In the last quarter of the year we will have a national conference on
teacher education. The Department of Education will present a vision for
teacher education in the radically changed circumstances in which we find
ourselves. I intend that this conference be the launch pad for a major
revision in popular attitudes towards teaching as a profession, an occasion
that will introduce the country to a new and compelling vision for teacher
education and teacher development.

In the Tirisano programme we have nominated HIV/Aids as our number one
priority. We are acutely aware of our responsibility to ensure that our
sector does everything in its capacity to contribute to the reduction of
HIV infections through timely and appropriate education. We have already
delivered nearly 1,2 million booklets to schools in South Africa in pursuit
of this.

We have three projects. The first is to improve awareness, information and
advocacy. The second is to ensure that life skills and HIV/Aids education
are integrated into the curriculum at all levels of the system. The third
is to develop planning models for understanding the impact of HIV/Aids on
the education and training system.

We are working very closely with the Departments of Health, Welfare and
Finance to ensure that the Government's special allocation for an
integrated HIV/Aids strategy is effectively used. A large proportion of
this year's allocation of R75 million will be channelled into support for
the education campaign in and out of schools.

The integrated strategy against HIV/Aids is so important for the future of
our nation that this Council might consider conducting a special debate on
the topic, particularly on its impact on young people and on teachers. I
hope that the Chairperson and the Whips will agree to this.

Let me end by saying that there is now a new climate of opinion about
education. There is now national mobilisation in support of education at
every level, and I want, very much, for the Council to be part of that
national mobilisation. I thank you very much. Siyabonga. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister of Education, hon members,
ladies and gentlemen, the challenges brought about by the communications
and technological revolution place a responsibility on all developing
countries to transform their education systems and to align themselves so
that they can respond to the challenges of the new century.

It is a fact that most modern nations with successful economies have
invested heavily in the education and training of their people. It is no
coincidence, therefore, that these are also the nations that are setting
the pace with the latest communications and technological innovations.

Unfortunately, that was not the case in South Africa prior to our first
democratic election. Education under the apartheid regime was not geared
towards the development of the full human potential of South Africans. On
the contrary, the vast majority of educational resources were used to
develop the human potential of a small privileged minority while the
education of the majority of our people was designed to condemn them to
employment as low-paid manual labourers and also to retain the levels of
poverty.

This unequal distribution of educational resources resulted in, firstly,
the average amount spent on white people being 147% higher than the amount
spent on African pupils, white students receiving almost twice as many
university degrees as African students in 1993 and white students being
awarded 73% of technikon diplomas against the 14% of African students in
1993.

The tragic end result of this inequity is reflected in the 1996 census
report, which was released in 1998. More than four million South Africans
over the age of 20 are illiterate. Just more than 3,5 million people have
had some primary school education, and slightly more than 1,7 million have
completed their primary school education. Fewer than 3,5 million people
have acquired senior certificates and close to 1,3 million have acquired
higher education. Such was the legacy which had to be addressed by our new
Government when it assumed power in 1994.

I want to make use of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of
Education and his department on the visionary Tirisano implementation
programme which was drawn up to address the legacy of apartheid education.
Their plan encapsulates the nine priorities identified by the Minister
which constitute the basic building blocks for the development of a fully
functioning education and training system that will drive us into the 21st
century. It is an innovative plan through which we hope to overcome the
obstacles of massive inequality, lack of access to facilities, low morale
of teachers and failure in governance or management of our schools and the
other educational institutions as well as the poor quality of learning in
much of the system.

Much of the groundwork for the successful implementation of this plan has
already been done. So far, eight of the nine provinces have indicated that
they have drafted their education plan using the Tirisano implementation
plan released by the hon the Minister of Education.

Provincial education departments have made assessments of their human
resources to determine whether they have sufficient capacity to implement
the work that has to be accomplished in pursuit of the implementation of
Tirisano. Four of the provinces have already indicated that they have
sufficient human resources within their existing personnel composition to
proceed with the implementation plan.

It is absolutely essential that all provinces have the necessary human
resource capacity to implement Tirisano. Two of the programmes which form
part of the Tirisano implementation plan relate to the reduction of
illiteracy and the creation of a vibrant further education and training
system which would equip youth and others to meet the social and economic
needs of the new century.

The eradication of illiteracy is very important, because of the direct link
between illiteracy and poverty. This came out in a report by the Human
Sciences Research Council which indicated that households with poorly
educated heads of household had a far higher incidence of poverty than
those with better educated heads of household. The eradication of
illiteracy is therefore an important weapon in our fight to stem the tide
of poverty.

In the same vein, we must also ensure that our institutions of higher
learning produce South Africans who not only have relevant skills and
knowledge which will enable us to keep pace with technology and innovation,
but actually set the pace with their new and innovative ideas.

All of us who are interested in the wellbeing of our education system have
a responsibility to assist with the successful implementation of this Bill.
[Applause.]

Ms T M JOEMAT-PETTERSSON (Northern Cape): Madam Chairperson, hon Minister,
hon members, although the Minister does not directly control or influence
the provincial education budgets, he has indeed cajoled us, through his
Tirisano campaign, to share his vision and mission for the total
transformation of education in the Northern Cape.

Our province has aligned its own strategic objectives with Tirisano
priorities and programmes, and our strategic objectives, infused in
financial planning, are captured in all delivery plans and budgets. We have
been called to action to accelerate change and to speed up delivery. The
Northern Cape province is indeed ready to respond to this call.
Furthermore, we are committed to meeting the challenge to achieve total
literacy by the year 2000. To some, this may seem an inflated target, but
we believe it to be possible.

We are committed to clamping down on dysfunctional schools and
undisciplined teachers and learners in our province. I would furthermore
like to appeal to all our schools and SGBs to use whatever means are at
their disposal to improve the discipline in their schools and to deal with
learners who persist in compromising their own futures.

Discipline must be understood in a wider societal context which includes
the classroom, the school and the community. A holistic view on discipline
involves a shared vision and mission according to which goals are set by
teachers, parents and learners. Let me join the Minisiter in saluting those
educators, parents and learners who, under trying, difficult circumstances,
continue to do their best. We share in the vision of an African
renaissance, and we shall make our contributions, albeit in a small and
incremental fashion.

The introduction of the Nama, Khoi and San languages into the Northern Cape
education curriculum will continue, and our curriculum unit has set aside
funds for this purpose. Similarly, we will fund a conscious and deliberate
programme to improve and expand the teaching of African and indigenous
languages in all schools in our province, including the former Model C
schools.

We have targeted rural and farm schools for preferential delivery. We will
consciously divert more resources to rural schools to develop capacity and
quality amongst educators and school governing bodies. To effect equity and
redress, approximately 350 educators have been redeployed this year in our
province.

The provisioning of nonteaching staff at schools has also been equalised so
that the inequalities that existed in this area are being phased out.
Whereas expenditure on salaries represented 92% of our budget in the 1999-
2000 financial year, we now intend spending 86% of our budget on salaries.
This will go a long way in accelerating service delivery in schools.

The implementation of the norms and standards for funding of public schools
will revolutionise school governance by delegating powers to public
schools. This will improve quality in public schools and establish
disciplined and purposeful school environments. About 290 school governing
bodies will be awarded various functions which include infrastructure
maintenance, purchasing of learner-support material and paying for services
which will allow them greater autonomy. This instrument is aimed at,
amongst other objectives, favouring the needs of the poorest of the poor
schools in our province. The schools in the poorest quintile are farm rural
schools and previously disadvantaged schools.

We have started a drive to provide schools with computers and Internet
access. Even the remotest schools can become part of the global village and
broaden the horizons of the learners. The establishment of an e-network for
schools will allow for greater co-operation and sharing amongst schools.

With regard to our school management teams, since 1994 we have experienced
a high attrition rate mainly due to the VSPs, which resulted in many
experienced educators and principals exiting the system. We have initiated
a drive to re-establish school management teams. Induction of principals is
taking place at all regional levels.

The procurement of learner-support material has been effective. I am proud
to report that all our learner-support material for outcomes-based
education had been delivered on time this year.

In conclusion, education can and must help to curb the spreading of
HIV/Aids. In conjunction with the Department of Health, we have programmes
in place to train educators in every school with a special focus on life-
skills education. Let us all devote our time and resources to educating our
people about this deadly disease. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, hon Minister of Education, Prof Kader Asmal,
special delegates from the provinces, hon permanent delegates of the NCOP,
recently the hon the Minister of Education was the unenvied recipient of a
dunce cap for the perceived inadequacies and shortcomings of education in
South African schools. However, the DP does not gloat over any
embarrassment that the hon the Minister may have suffered. On the contrary,
we felt that it was unfair and totally inappropriate that the one Minister
in the Cabinet of President Thabo Mbeki who evinces such an industrial mien
and who is the very epitome of commitment and application should have been
awarded a dunce cap by the unschooled group of scholars.

However, to put things into perspective, one can understand the
frustrations experienced by the schoolchildren. The education landscape in
the country is indeed a bleak and sombre one, interrupted only by ant-hill
mounds of undisciplined teachers and intransigent scholars and craters of
shortages of resources such as textbooks, libraries and laboratories, even
recreational facilities. I feel as Matthew Arnold did when he wrote Dover
Beach


  ... the world, which seems
  To lie before us like a land of dreams,
  So various, so beautiful, so new,
  Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
  Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain ...

No, the poet was not describing the South Africa of today, but he could
well have been.

Let me hasten to say that the DP acknowledges the merits of the hon the
Minister's five-year implementation plan that has just been released.

We are impressed with the Minister's priorities in establishing school
effectiveness and educator professionalism. Only a school system that
functions effectively and efficiently could restore public confidence in
the system. There must be a return to quality and standards, aspects which
have disintegrated considerably in recent years.
The hon the Minister would do well to pause and reflect on the damage being
done to our schools and the whole culture of wholesome learning and
teaching by certain elements within the pool of educators and the school
populace. From every village in the furthest corner of our beloved country,
mothers and fathers are crying out for unfettered access to decent
education for their children.

Great sacrifices are being made by poor parents to ensure that their
children will not have to tread the same terrain as them, impoverished and
humiliated as they were by the accoutrements of poverty. The doors must
open to an open-opportunity society, unhindered by the veritable bouncers
that slam the doors of learning with utter disdain. The practitioners of
such a culture of disdain, disrespect and dishonesty are none other than
those educators who show an unprofessional attitude and conduct towards
their professional mandate.

The SA Democratic Teachers' Union must boldly but shamefacedly come to the
front of the country's classroom and apologise for its role in
overestimating its own importance and underestimating the intelligence of
the public. It must acknowledge, publicly, that within its inner bosom,
there are some misguided educators who are not only undisciplined but show
scant regard for professional ethics.

The DP therefore welcomes the development of the SA Council for Educators
as a professional body for educators, to ensure teaching standards and
ethics. The DP hopes that poor matric results have reached their nadir. We
are optimistic that a serious attempt to rein in the miscreants in the
teaching profession will go a long way towards raising the pass rate of not
only matriculants, but all other grades as well.

The conduct of educators must evince a more disciplined commitment to their
professional duties, and learners, too, must pay more serious attention to
their classwork. Only when such a tone is set in our schools, can we really
produce more acceptable percentages in the pass rate of matriculants and
other grades.

Another arena of concern for the DP is the question of governance and
management of our schools. The idea of invoking the South African Schools
Act and establishing school governing bodies is yet another welcome feature
of the Minister's five-year implementation plan. Unfortunately, the
functioning of these bodies, at present, leaves much to be desired. The
absence of clear rules of conduct and of clarity on the eligibility of who
should serve on the SGBs, tenure of service, reflection of school
population demographics, etc, has had adverse consequences in educator
appointments, promotions, granting of tuckshop permits and the like.

There is increasing evidence of principals colluding with chairpersons of
SGBs in the appointment and promotion of educators. Age-old considerations
of suitability, professional qualifications, seniority, etc, have been
thrown to the wind. We request that the Minister consider giving serious
attention to the subject of SGBs and establish the appropriate criteria for
their smooth functioning.

I conclude with the hopeful words of Percy Bysshe Shelley in Ode to the
West Wind:


  O Wind,
  If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?

[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I am glad to note that members are seeking to
impress the Minister with their reading interests. [Laughter.]

Mr L SUKA: Madam Chair, hon Minister and hon members, may I be bold and
open with this House today by making an assertion that all honest and keen
observers of the performance of both national and provincial spheres of
government in South Africa will not fail to notice the tremendous vision,
collaboration and positive progress made from 1994 to date.

Notwithstanding the twin apartheid legacy of mass poverty and
underdevelopment on the one hand, and a dysfunctional state machinery
characterised by corruption, inefficiency, gross maladministration and poor
financial management on the other hand, the Eastern Cape is perhaps the
best illustration of these positive changes taking place in the new
democratic South Africa.

We are the first to admit that the road we have travelled so far has been
rough and tough. We are also aware that many more challenges and hardships
lie ahead, but the resilience of our people, born of more than three
centuries of struggle and their determination to forge ahead, buttressed
our vision. Financial discipline and focused programmes will see us
through.

Once more, this policy budget we present today is further testimony of our
commitment to advancing the socioeconomic transformation agenda that was
overwhelmingly endorsed in the 1999 elections by the people of South Africa
and, in particular, the people of the Eastern Cape.

Regarding the 2000-01 budget, I must say that we commend the Minister for
having changed the situation in that province. The Department of Education
has emerged from a testing period as far as its finances are concerned.
Insufficient budgetary resources have resulted in less than adequate
allocation for education in schools. The effects of this situation have
been manifest to all stakeholders in education. However, I want to proclaim
to this House today that we have turned the corner and can now look forward
to less desperate times ahead.

In this financial year the Department of Education will have a significant
amount of funds available for nonpersonnel expenditure for the first time
in three years. The size of the nonpersonnel budget is important, because
it provides funding for essential teaching and learning materials and for
the running costs of schools and other educational institutions.

Our allocation for nonpersonnel expenditure has improved dramatically to
the tune of R653,3 million. During each of the previous two years the
available nonpersonnel budget sank to between R200 million and R250 million
owing to the suspension of funds for debt repayment. In 2000-01 the
department will be able to devote its entire nonpersonnel budget to service
delivery, resulting in increased availability of funds for schools.

The education department of the Eastern Cape has achieved control over
expenditure, turning around overexpenditure of R991,2 million in 1997-98 to
projected expenditure within the budget for the 1999-2000 financial year.

The success we have achieved in budget management, of course, comes at a
cost to service delivery in this sector, if we remember last year. I do,
however, believe that if we are able to address the remaining problems with
regard to expenditure control, we will be able to provide for a rising flow
in service in the years to come.

Significant progress has also been made in the payment of debt, which has
been the principal factor in reducing the nonpersonnel budget of the
department for the past two years.

At the end of 1997-98 the department reached a peak of R1,1 billion which
had been reduced to R518 million by the start of the 1999-2000 financial
year. Despite the additional burden imposed by rank and notch promotions
during 1999-2000, a further sum of R223 million was directed to debt
repayment. The department will therefore face an outstanding debt of R295
million, which brings the end of debt repayment within sight because of the
improved budget which we have received.

We must also say that, despite the improvement in the budget, we are still
faced with a few challenges in our province which I would like to mention.
The first one is the question of infrastructure in schools. The situation
is very serious in respect of this area. Many schools have virtually no
classrooms due to the backlogs of the past as well as the devastating
tornados in the rural areas. Members may recall the Transkei tornados. Huge
sums of money are needed to address this backlog.

According to the audit review, the last time that a school was built or
infrastructure was delivered in that area of Transkei was in 1982. Only one
school was built since then. We have achieved remarkable improvement in
that regard after the election of the democratic Government led by the ANC
in 1994. In other words, those schools need to be rebuilt because some of
them were built with mud.

With regard to the financial situation, although there was a substantial
increment in our budget to which I have alluded, which is an attempt by the
provincial treasurer to address some of the operational needs of the
Department of Education, the base of needs is increasing annually. Areas
that have to be looked at seriously, especially in our province, and which
are always reported on in the press, include nonpayment of electricity by
schools, especially those schools that are disadvantaged, and transport for
rural children. More than a million children have to walk long distances to
school. As members will understand, our province has a rural nature. As a
result one will find pupils walking a single journey of more than three
kilometres to school. We would like a lot of assistance in respect of this
issue.

Another area is the roads. This is a cry in the province. For instance, 45
000 km of our province's road network is gravel road and only 7 000 km is
tarred road. When there are rains, schools in our province become
inaccessible, especially in the Transkei. I do not know what happened to
the budgets of the previous governments. When we bring these issues on
board, it seems as if the ANC Government is ineffective, and yet we forget
the legacy that we have inherited from the past. [Interjections.]

We need to increase the base for critical subjects by appointing, if
possible, more science teachers, that is to say mathematics, biology and
accounting educators, so as to shift and advance the outcomes-based
education in that direction.

I will not allude to the question of textbooks because we still have a few
schools which have not yet received textbooks. I remember that in our REC
meeting, very recently, there was a cry that textbooks had not yet arrived
at particular schools.

I also want to say that teachers' morale has risen dramatically and I
understand that Sadtu is having a three-day NGC to advance transformation
in education. So the statement that was made by the DP member here, and the
many questions raised, are invalid. I will not take that lying down. It is
a pity that he referred to Sadtu, because across the country some teachers
are ill-disciplined, not Sadtu teachers per se.

With regard to the management of schools, the province is instilling strict
disciplinary measures in all schools that seem to be wayward.

Although there are schools in which discipline has broken down, there are
very few of them. In this province especially, we have adopted a no-
nonsense approach. When schools opened very recently some of our members
did see the hon member Majodina visiting one of the schools. That is our
line of action. During our constituency week we will be physically visiting
those schools that are not doing us a favour.

On the question of Tirisano, it is very clear. I will not repeat or mince
my words. The issue for us is to follow Tirisano to the letter. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs J NDIMANDE (Northern Province): Chairperson and the House, thank you
very much for affording me this opportunity to share with members the
Northern Province's perspective on identified aspects pertaining to
education. The Northern Province department of education has a guideline
amount of R5 992 037 000 allocated within eight programmes. This amount is
ringfenced for education financial management from the national Department
of Education.

The unringfenced guideline amount of the 2000-2001 budget for the
provincial department of education represents a percentage growth rate of
1,13% from the unringfenced 1999-2000 budget. It is worth mentioning that
our budget consumes 43,86% of the total provincial budget. It is through
this budget that our department hopes to fast-track the development of
human resources in this province.
The salvation of our province from the abyss of ignorance, poverty and
lawlessness depends largely on the intervention strategies which the
Department of Education will put in place.

Regarding school management, the success of any institution depends on the
effectiveness of its management structure. It is precisely for that reason
that our provincial department of education takes school management
development very seriously. Of the 4 500 schools in the province, 474
schools are led by acting principals. There are 875 vacant deputy
principalship posts and 2 489 vacant head of department posts.

We have already advertised all the 474 principal posts and we hope to fill
them by 30 June 2000. Our next priority is that of the heads of department,
if the curricular imperatives of our schools are to be realised. To this
end, we are planning to fill the head of department posts in a staggered
fashion, so as to operate within the limitations of our budget. The next
category of posts to be filled will be that of deputy principals.

We are also engaged in the training of our principals in the fields of
whole school development, financial management and labour relations. We are
convinced that this kind of training will improve the management capacity
of our principals and thereby enhance the performance of our schools. Show
me a good school, and I will show you a good principal.

In terms of the availability of textbooks, the provision of adequate
learning support material remains one of the worrisome issues within the
department of education, not only in the Northern Province, but
countrywide. While we remain steadfastly committed to providing each and
every learner with all basic learning tools such as textbooks, stationery
and classroom accommodation, budgetary constraints remain the most critical
factor.

In the 1999-2000 financial year we were able to prioritise the supply of
textbooks for Grades 1, 2, 3, 7, and 12. For Grades 1, 2 and 12 this was
mostly in the form of top-ups, whereas for Grades 3 and 7 we purchased a
full complement of OBE learning materials.

Only R54 million has been budgeted for textbooks in the 2000-01 financial
year.

It must also be noted that next year we will be phasing in Grade 4 and 8.
We hope that the national department will be able to bail us out in this
respect. We are, however, putting systems in place to increase the textbook
recovery rate at the end of each academic year. Our department throws its
entire weight behind the Cosas-initiated campaign dubbed ``Operation
Mazibuye''.

Effective school governing bodies and parental involvement in school
affairs is undoubtedly a precondition for effective teaching and learning.
Experience has shown that effective school governance, coupled with active
parental participation in school matters, brings about stability in schools
and also enhances the general performance of our schools. To this end, our
provincial department of education has set aside some funds for the
elections and for the capacity-building programme for school governing
bodies, or SGBs. The participation of NGOs and private donors in the area
of capacity-building for SGBs is also helping a great deal in addressing
our budgetary constraints. We remain grateful for this kind of financial
assistance.

Regarding Tirisano, the department's budget is geared towards the
realisation of the five Tirisano programmes. We are, however, unable to
implement all the programmes owing to budgetary constraints. We have
already developed business plans around the Tirisano programmes so that we
can access the policy reserve funds or discretionary funds to implement the
same. Our core structures and programmes have been infused into the school
effectiveness programme to ensure that our schools become effective sites
of educational change.

We hope to complete the rationalisation and redeployment process, appoint
principals in all 474 of our schools that are still run by acting
principals, and establish the second democratic governing bodies in all
schools by the end of June 2000. We have already sent work programmes for
all subjects to our schools. Members will appreciate that our province has,
since 1998, made trial examinations a permanent feature of the department.

These work programmes will go a long way towards ensuring that all our
Grade 12 teachers have completed three quarters of the various syllabi by
June 2000, when our Grade 12 learners will be sitting for the trial
examinations. Our Grade 12 learners are also engaged in Saturday classes in
the programme called Learner Performance Improvement Strategy. We will also
subject all of them in winter to enrichment classes. All of these
intervention strategies are meant to enhance the performance of our schools
and improve matric results, in particular.

Regarding rural school development when the new democracy dawned in 1994
the whole country had a classroom backlog of 60 000. The Northern Province
alone accounted for 35 000 of this national backlog. Up to today we have
been able to build 16 000 classrooms. This means that we still have a
backlog of 19 000 classrooms. In this financial year we have allocated R21
million towards the construction of 188 classrooms in 47 identified
schools. The majority of these schools are in the rural areas where our
children are receiving their tuition under trees.

For us to be able to address the infrastructure provisioning backlog in
this province, we will need R6,5 billion in order to have adequate
classrooms, administrative blocks, libraries, laboratories, school halls
and playgrounds. At this budgetary rate of R21 million per annum, we will
need in excess of 150 years to address this backlog. We therefore once more
appeal to the national Government to bail us out so that our children can
develop on the same level as children from the other provinces. We
obviously cannot wait 150 years for backlogs to be eradicated.

The Northern Province department of education places much emphasis on the
retraining of teachers. In addition to other programmes conducted at our
rationalised colleges of education, we have established an instant
component called the Centre for Continuous Professional Development.
Curriculum advisers are stationed at those centres at which educators are
retrained in the field of OBE maths, science, technology, English, and
management sciences such as business economics, economics and accounting.
Funds permitting, we would also like to see these centres operating at
their maximum potential to include all disciplines offered in our schools.
In conclusion, the horrors created by the past inequitable distribution of
resources still haunt us to this day. For the Northern Province, this
legacy finds conspicuous expression in the provision of education. We
remain hopeful that the imminent visit by the Portfolio Committee on
Education will go a long way in exposing the harsh realities of the
situation in our schools. The sooner we address these backlogs, the better
for the future of our children, the province and the country as a whole.
[Applause.]

Mrs G N M PANDOR: Mr Chairperson, the commitment of the Government to
education investment is further confirmed by this year's allocation to
education at all levels. I think the Minister would agree that Government's
commitment to educational progress remains unwavering, as he indicated in
his introductory comments.

Participants in the debate on this Vote have added provincial detail to the
various initiatives outlined by the Minister, and have pointed to the
significant range of challenges that continue to face South Africa. In my
view the Minister, his department and Ministry have to be congratulated for
returning sanity to education. It seems that, at last, we may have a
dedicated teaching force staffing our schools and offering quality
education to our learners. We may have learners who, for the first time in
many decades, seem keen to take on the responsibility for learning.

Congratulations are also due to the Minister for his resolve to demystify
Curriculum 2005. Clearly, curriculum change is vitally necessary, but its
success depends on teachers knowing how to effectively implement it. The
learning areas and objectives of Curriculum 2005 make a great deal of
sense, but there is a need to ensure adequate teacher development
programmes in all these learning areas so that teachers can cope. Beyond
this training for the new curriculum, departments of education, both at the
provincial and at the national levels, also have to begin to closely
examine the possibility of including the wide range of subjects that remain
closed to the majority of South African learners.

Music, art, drama and foreign languages are subjects that have been denied
to black children. This means that, for many of them, there is little
chance of their contributing to the African renaissance. These children can
only converse with other South African children. They cannot speak to
children in Angola, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi
and Côte d'Ivoire. Such a situation cannot go unchanged, particularly given
the important role that South Africa is going to play in Africa.

An added and major area of challenge is one that, surprisingly, enjoys very
little discussion in the NCOP and, it seems, in provincial legislatures.
This is the higher education sector. The silence is probably due to this
area being an exclusive national competence, but given the fact of
institutions being in provinces and the vital role that they contribute to
our development, there is much that provinces could say about universities,
technikons and colleges.

The Minister's recent actions in this sector are welcome initiatives. It
seems we will begin to see active implementation of critical aspects of the
Higher Education Act of 1997. The Minister's recent engagement with senior
managers in this sector is also to be applauded.

The role that various vice chancellors have played in the decline of
tertiary institutions is most worrisome, as is the negative role of
councils that do not exercise the statutory teeth they have to ensure
efficiency and responsiveness in the sector.

At times, when one reads the submissions from some institutions, one gets
the feeling that they do not appreciate the critical importance of ensuring
that we have a thriving and accountable higher education sector, a sector
that will offer quality programmes and quality graduates to South Africa.
One often reads the whining tone of some of these submissions, a tone that
implies that it is self-evident, for example, that historically
disadvantaged institutions, or HDIs, are deserving. This is a tone and
belief that I think has to be vigorously challenged.

Having said that, however, it must be acknowledged that HDIs did make a
significant contribution to black access to higher education in the tough
days under apartheid. The agenda before them and ourselves today is to
convert that contribution into a new and worthwhile form of delivery to
South Africa. This is necessary because, unfortunately, a negative spirit
and ethos entered several of our HDIs in the early days of our democracy.
It is an ethos that suggests that change and transformation are not
challenges, but are characteristics one is endowed with if one is
disadvantaged. I think we need to get rid of this attitude.

The Minister has correctly sought to challenge this ``I am evidently
deserving'' attitude which is displayed by some of these HDIs. This is to
be applauded. However, it must be stressed that we do need to look
seriously at how we develop and reconstruct HDIs so that they do make an
increasingly positive contribution to our human resource needs. I am firmly
of the view that programme-based higher education planning will help us to
erase the belief that higher education is an urban-based activity and that
rural-based institutions cannot succeed in the sector. I trust that the
reports of the various task teams that have been created and established by
the Minister will set higher education on a new development path, and will
offer some of our HDIs the opportunity to play a meaningful role in
research and teaching at the post-secondary level of education.

Finally, I would like to turn to the worrying instances of sexual
harassment in our schools. This is a subject we have not raised up to this
point, and I have noted with concern that there is, in fact, a significant
incidence of sexual harassment of girls in our schools.

I must also indicate that I have a feeling that at times we do not react
fast enough, nor do we seem to have disciplinary measures that ensure that
teachers who harass pupils will be dealt with speedily and effectively, and
that school principals who utilise their positions to harass female
teachers will be dealt with speedily and effectively. I think it is a fact
that children go to school in order to take advantage of an opportunity to
advance themselves and to fully enhance their potential. They do not go
there in order to be harassed by adults who are in loco parentis to them.

I believe that we need to ask the Minister, in his discussions with the
MECs at provincial level, to urge action in this area, because the reports
of all these instances are unwelcome reports and they evidence actions by
teachers which should not exist in our schools.

I would like to thank the committee for having allowed me to participate in
this debate, and I am truly excited at the new developments in education
that we see emerging in South Africa today. [Applause.]

Mev J WITBOOI: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister en agb lede, die onderwys,
die voetstuk waarop die vooruitgang van enige nasie gebou word, kom vandag
in hierdie Huis aan die beurt. Die onderwysbegroting is met 2% verminder,
en as ons begin somme maak, mag ons tot die gevolgtrekking kom dat tot
11 000 onderwysers dalk uit hulle posisies sal moet padgee. My somme mag
verkeerd wees; ek was nie 'n wiskundige op skool nie. Dit is 11 000
onderwysers wat dalk broodnodig is om 'n nasie te help bou.

Die onderwysbegroting is dié begroting van elke land, want dit is die
begroting wat die daarstelling van geleenthede moet bied om 'n rooskleurige
toekoms op alle vlakke te bewerkstellig. Die Minister het 'n wonderlike
plan, naamlik Tirisano, en ons almal is oortuig dat as sy begroting sou
toelaat wat hy in die vooruitsig gestel het om ongeletterdheid by
volwassenes en jongmense binne vyf jaar uit te wis, die lewenstandaarde van
miljoene mense kan verbeter, en die Nuwe NP steun hom heelhartig hierin.
Ek staan vandag hier voor die agb Minister om hom te vra hoe ons Suid-
Afrika op 'n wenpad wil plaas as die Regering besig is om die pre-primêre
skole dood te wurg. Sielkundiges beweer dat wat 'n mens in sy eerste ses
lewensjare leer, nooit vergeet word nie. As dit so is, en ek is ook nie 'n
sielkundige nie, vra ek my die vraag af of die pre-primêre fase nie juis
die grondslag moet bied sodat ons in die hoëronderwysfase die wiskundiges
en ekonome van hierdie land kan oplewer nie.

As ons ons verbind tot die leuse, ``'n Gelyke kans vir alle leerders,''
moet ons juis begin waar dit saak maak, naamlik onderwys in die pre-primêre
fase in Suid-Afrika. Baie jare van vandag af moet die leerders wat nou in
daardie fase sit as belastingbetalers tot die staatskas bydra. Hulle moet
dit kan bekostig om aan 'n goeie mediese fonds te behoort. Hulle moet
trotse Suid-Afrikaners wees wat deel uitmaak van een van die ekonomiese
reuse in die wêreld. Gaan ons hulle dit misgun deur toe te laat dat hulle
sonder onderwysers sit as van die poste vakant geword het?

Die Nuwe NP kan hom ook nie versoen met die gedagte dat slegs R2 per dag
tot 'n maksimum van R10 per klas aan pre-primêre skole toegedeel word nie.
Die Raad op Hoër Onderwys het skokkende feite rakende kwynende
studentegetalle aan hoëronderwysinstellings bekend gemaak. Dit is
kommerwekkend dat vooruitskattings van getalle by die
hoëronderwysinstellings nie gerealiseer het nie en dat daar volgens die
verslae aan die Gekose Komitee oor Onderwys voorgelê 'n beduidende afname
in getalle is by hoëronderwysinstellings in voorheen benadeelde streke.

Daar is vele vrae op hierdie gebied wat beantwoord moet word. Dit is vrae
soos: wat het van ons land se studente geword? Watter finansiële impak gaan
hierdie tendens, sou dit voortduur, op hierdie instellings hê? Gegrond op
die feit dat een van die Minister se nege prioriteite is dat die
opvoedkundige instellings die sentrum van die gemeenskap moet wees, wil ons
glo dat die Minister onverwyld aan hierdie negatiewe aspek aandag sal gee.

Die onderwys is nie gespaar van korrupsie nie. Baie gevalle doen hulle voor
waar voornemende toetreders tot die arbeidsmark asook ander leerders vals
sertifikate te koop kan kry, soms by mense wat hulself opvoeders noem.

Die Nuwe NP voel dat praktyke van dié aard nie tuishoort in ``Onderwys Suid-
Afrika'' nie. Die Nuwe NP waardeer die feit dat die agb Minister van
Onderwys en die Departement Gesondheid hulle aan die inwerkingstelling van
Vigs-programme sal toewy.

Kennis oor die nagevolge van hierdie monster-epidemie is die minste wat ons
aan ons leerders kan oordra, en hoe vroeër met sodanige programme begin
word, hoe beter vir ons land se ekonomie op die lang termyn.

Ek sluit af deur te sê, net die beste is goed genoeg vir ons kinders. Mag
hierdie Begroting die vermoë hê om die beste vir hulle te gee. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, education,
the foundation upon which the prosperity of any nation is built, will be
discussed in this House today. The education budget has been decreased by
2%, and once we start making calculations, we may come to the conclusion
that up to 11 000 teachers may have to vacate their posts. My calculations
may be incorrect; as a student I did not excel at maths. That means 11 000
teachers who may be essential in helping to build a nation.

The education budget is the most important budget of every country, because
it is the budget that must make opportunities available to ensure a bright
future at all levels. The Minister has a wonderful plan, namely Tirisano,
and we are all convinced that if his budget were to allow what he has
envisaged, namely to eradicate illiteracy among adults and young people
within five years, this could improve the standard of living of millions of
people, and the New NP supports him wholeheartedly in this.

Today I stand here before the hon the Minister to ask him how we can place
South Africa on the road to victory, if the Government is killing pre-
primary schools. Psychologists allege that what one learns in the first six
years of one's life, one never forgets. If that is so, and I am also not a
psychologist, I ask myself whether the pre-primary phase should not in fact
form the foundation, so that in the higher education phase we can produce
the mathematicians and economists of this country.

If we commit ourselves to the slogan ``an equal chance for all learners,''
we should really start where it matters, namely education in the pre-
primary phase in South Africa. Many years from now the learners who are now
in that phase will have to contribute to the treasury as taxpayers. They
must be able to afford to belong to good medical schemes. They must be
proud South Africans who form part of one of the economic giants of the
world. Are we going to begrudge them that by allowing them to be left
without teachers if some of the posts become vacant?

The New NP can also not reconcile itself with the idea that only R2 per day
up to a maximum of R10 per class is allocated to pre-primary schools.

The Council on Higher Education has made public shocking facts with regard
to declining student numbers at higher education institutions. It is
alarming that projected numbers at higher education institutions have not
become a reality and according to the reports which have been submitted to
the Select Committee on Education, there is a significant decrease in
numbers at higher education institutions in previously disadvantaged areas.

In this domain there are many questions which must be answered. Questions
such as: what has become of the students of our country? What financial
implications will this tendency have for these institutions, if it were to
continue? Given the fact that one of the Minister's nine priorities is that
educational institutions must be the centre of the community, we want to
believe that the Minister will pay attention to this negative aspect
without delay.

Education is not free of corruption. There are many instances where
potential entrants to the labour market, as well as other learners, can buy
forged certificates, sometimes from people who call themselves educators.

The New NP is of the opinion that such practices do not belong in
``Education South Africa''. The New NP appreciates the fact that the hon
the Minister of Education and the Department of Health will dedicate
themselves to the implementation of Aids-programmes.

Knowledge about the impact of this monster epidemic is the least we can
convey to our learners, and the earlier we start with such programmes, the
better it will be for the economy of our country in the long term.

I want to end by saying that only the best is good enough for our children.
May this Budget have the capacity to give them the best. [Applause.]]

Mr P G QOKWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, delegates and members, I
remember the time when I first met the hon the Minister. I told him that I
did not envy him the job that he was going to do. His response was that I
must have been a schoolmaster. Later, in the course of time, I again met
the hon the Minister and told him that I now envied him because I could see
the strides he was making.

This debate should provide a critique on the extent the resources allocated
are matching the policy priorities and advice on whether we have created
incentives for efficiency and equity in education service delivery. This
should be seen in the spirit of the hon the Minister's Tirisano project to
salvage parts of our education system from their dysfunctionality, to
redress the inequalities, rekindle the educator morale, confront failure of
governance and management, and address the poor quality of learning in the
light of his nine priorities.

This review, further, is informed by the keen support given his renewed
vigour by the various MECs, amongst them that of the Eastern Cape, with a
12-point plan. I recall there are also other MECs from other provinces who
had plans of their own. However, the success of these plans will depend
largely on an adequate supply of skilled school managers and educators. It
is a fact that rural and township schools in many instances were found
unready to implement the new school funding norms, as they did not know how
to manage an institution. Some did not even have a bank account at all.
This is an indication of the imbalances we still have to redress.

We probably have to go beyond consultation and plans on the educator
appraisal system to implement a rigorous performance management system at
all levels with constructive reviews given at intervals, backed by personal
development programmes as part of the performance contract.

This further indicates the need to go beyond the formulae we use at present
for funding the provinces in order to cater for the needs occasioned by the
disparities in the historical development of these provinces. Thanks to the
hon the Minister's endeavours to commit Government to bringing about
redemption in this regard. There is a need, therefore, for the conditional
grants to include amounts to support capacity-building and eliminate
classroom backlogs.

The report of the last provincial study tour in the Eastern Cape placed the
funding requirement at about R600 million per annum over five years to
address classroom backlogs only, and R92 million to rebuild and renovate
the rural schools damaged by natural disasters. The problem of children who
travel from the banks of the Xolobe for three hours on a one-way journey to
the banks of the Nqancule, crossing a number of rivers like the Mbulu and
Mbulukhweza, through Luthuli and Nconcolorha of Tsomo, indicates the state
of permanent disaster in which the province of the Eastern Cape finds
itself.

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Thetha mkhaya. [Tell them, homeboy.]

Mr P G QOKWENI: It creates a disaster, not only when there are floods, it
adds to the state of perpetual disaster.

Higher education institutions have had to increase access and participation
in line with the policies of the Government and in keeping with the call
for massification. This happens in the face of declining contributions by
Government, placing especially the historically disadvantaged institutions
in situations of greater disadvantage. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E SEGALO (Free State): Mr Chairperson, the state of education in our
province is no different from that of the rest of the country. We continue
to be confronted with more or less the same challenges that are found in
all parts of our country, particularly where education is concerned.

These challenges sometimes appear to be insurmountable, but with the will
and determination of our people, they are equally being handled and
managed. We cannot fold our arms and sing songs of despair. That will not
get our country anywhere. We have to turn the system around with the few
resources at our disposal in order to ensure that all our people are on
board, that we deal urgently and purposefully with education
transformation, and that we redress the past imbalances and use education
as a mechanism to build a society free of fear and anger, a society that
shares the same value system and believes in the notion of equality,
nonracialism and integration.

The Free State education department has been engaged in a series of
consultations and interactions with various stakeholders. This has been
largely aimed at, firstly, ensuring that public quality education and
training is assured; secondly, that we take along all relevant stakeholders
in education; and, lastly, that we mobilise all sectors of communities in
the reconstruction of our education system.

From January 2000, when the schools reopened, the department has been
engaged in a process of visiting our 12 districts, the purpose being to
engage with our officials at operational level and to chart a way forward
collectively. Subsequent to that, all schools that had a pass rate of less
than 40% in the Grade 12 examinations were called to account for their
performance. These schools were divided into two categories. The first
category was made up of all those schools which had achieved a pass rate of
between zero and 20%. The second group comprised those which had achieved a
pass rate above 20% but less than 40%. Consultations focused on addressing
shortcomings and weaknesses of the past, and provision of required
management support and assistance by the department.

The process is going to be carried through until the end of the academic
year. However, matric results cannot be viewed as the only barometer for
educational excellence. We believe that these results are but a
manifestation of the 12 years of schooling from Grade R to Grade 12. The
focus is therefore on all the grades, in particular Grade 9, where
continued common examinations are going to be introduced. Secondary schools
have school development plans with clear targets and benchmarks. School
management teams, along with the entire staff complement, are responsible
for its implementation.

Disciplinary measures are being taken against both educators and officials
who are not productive and who thus contribute towards the collapse of the
system.

More than 90% of our schools have been allocated learning support material
and textbooks. Delays have been caused by printers, in particular, of
textbooks. The PTSAs have been duly replaced by school governing bodies in
terms of the South African Schools Act. Most schools have these
democratically recognised structures. However, they are not fully
functional, especially in historically disadvantaged areas. In some
instances, they are manipulated by school management teams. Some of them
were not elected properly and were thus appointments by school management
teams.

With regard to historically advantaged schools, there are some who still
linger in the traditions of the past by failing to implement and align
themselves with the new educational changes. They do not follow the South
African Schools Act, but rather use the old apartheid government
structures, such as parent associations-structures which inhibit
participation of both learners and educators. The department has declared
such undemocratic structures illegitimate and illegal.

Elections for new school governing bodies will be conducted in May for all
the schools. Training is being provided for school management developers
and other officials who will serve as electoral officers. The participation
of communities in matters of education has greatly improved. A programme
has been developed with the provincial legislature, through the standing
committee on education, for members of the legislature to adopt schools and
to assist in monitoring and lending support. Local government is also
getting involved through the adoption of schools by councillors.
Business and the private sector have been positively mobilised through
provincial initiatives such as the Free State's education awards. This
sector contributed greatly towards the enhancement of quality public
education by giving various sponsorships. This has made the partnership
between Government and the private sector a reality.

Mobilisation of communities continues to be the hallmark of our programme
of educational transformation and reconstruction. It is at the centre of
this programme because, clearly, without visible participation of
communities we will fail to achieve our noble intentions. The nine
priorities of Tirisano are being attended to by the department and other
role-players. Tirisano is being implemented side by side with the culture
of learning and the teaching campaign.

Particular attention is given to infrastructural deficiencies that exist,
with a view to addressing them. Our budget for the next three years is
geared towards eliminating backlogs in our system, reducing the number of
platooning schools, and ensuring that every classroom has an educator.

An HIV/Aids programme focusing on life-skills education and the workplace
was recently launched. Training and development of the school as a whole
institution continues to receive attention. More emphasis is placed on
making our schools work, which is characterised by ensuring that learners
learn, educators teach and managers manage. We are paying special attention
to adult basic education and training, and we are in the process of
developing clear targets in order to break the back of illiteracy.

The budget for this sector has been increased twofold. The state of
education has improved dramatically in the province, and, with the
necessary sustained support, reflects positive developments. There are
certain schools that still practise subtle racism and discrimination, for
instance, through their admission policies. However, integration is moving
at a normal pace in the majority of our schools, especially at Model C
schools.

Every learner has the right to register at an institution of his or her
choice, provided he or she meets the necessary requirements as per the
precepts of the South African Schools Act. The Human Rights Commission will
be running a workshop for master trainers on antiracism and on developing
good practices.

We intend to develop it further in the province in an attempt to combat
racism. A provincial programme called Tswelopele has been running for more
than three years. Its scope of work is around rural schools development. It
is intended to provide required support to farm schools. Focus is given to
both material and human resource development. To date, it has mobilised
resources from the private sector for the building of classrooms, the
organising of sports activities and learner and teacher support materials,
focusing on reading and writing skills. The programme was the winner for
two years of the Premier's Award.

In the Free State - this is very important - the majority of our schools
are farm schools. Discussions are continuing with individual farm owners
and the Free State Agricultural Union to enter into contracts for schools
on private land. Thus far our statistics reveal that we have 1 601 public
schools on private property. Of this number, we have signed 357 contracts,
and we are following up on 1 121 agreements. We have 123 farm owners who
are not willing to enter into any agreement with the department.
Once more we want to extend our gratitude to the Free State Agricultural
Union for their support. The situation is being managed. However, it might
get out of control if the majority of farm owners refuse to enter into
agreements that would ensure that farm-school-going children enjoy their
constitutional right to free and compulsory education.

Retraining of educators is a very critical component of our work. With
these huge challenges confronting us, it is important to note that we have
no option but to retrain and reorientate our educators because they
constitute the bedrock of our success. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister of Education, special
delegates from the provinces and the honourable House, the Education
Department's mission is to provide quality education which is accessible,
cost-effective and affordable to all relevant stakeholders.

For the current financial year, the department is focusing on delivery in
accordance with the principles of Tirisano and on the nine priority plans
outlined by the Minister of Education in his five-year plan for the 21st
century. In an attempt to provide educational services in the North West
province, its education budget has been increased from R3,27 billion in
1999-2000 to R3,51 billion for the 2000-2001 financial year. The province's
equitable share of the national Department of Education's budget is 8%.

The performance of Grade 12 students has not been impressive in the past
few years and has continued to decline every year. The pass rate dropped
from 69,6% in 1996 to 52,1% in 1999. Whatever the reasons are for this
decline, political parties in the province are not blameless in this state
of affairs, because very often they have mobilised learners and educators
for their own party-political ends. In other instances, educators have left
their schools unattended in order to participate in marches organised by
nonprofessional organisations. However, we have noted with appreciation the
stringent steps that have been taken by the Government to apply the
principle of no work no pay.

This principle will, to a large measure, curb disorder and loitering. The
UCDP is in full support of this principle. HIV/Aids has been declared by
the Department of Education as a first priority, and the provincial
government has allocated some R1 793 million towards awareness-training and
other support programmes.

This epidemic has assumed serious proportions in many urban and rural
areas. Many youngsters are dying from this epidemic, whilst others who have

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister of Education and hon
members, the task of transforming our formerly divided system of education
has never been an easy task. The previous and the present Ministers of
Education have both performed well in bringing the various racially divided
systems of education together. In fact, this country has never had a system
of education before. Various pieces of legislation aimed at transforming
the education system have been passed. We in KwaZulu-Natal have supported
some of these pieces of legislation - sometimes with some reservations,
because, in transforming the old system, we have always believed that every
cloud has a silver lining.

However, the IFP feels that there is a gap between legislation formulation
and implementation. There are reasons for this. Firstly, provinces must
implement national mandates, but the lack of capacity has militated against
the provinces implementing national mandates. Secondly, another factor
which negates the implementation capacity of provinces is funding. Thirdly,
90% of provincial budgets is taken up by personnel expenditure and, as a
result, very meagre funds are available for capital projects, like giving
security in the learning-teaching environment.

Fourthly, we have heard about teachers being killed on education premises,
either by schoolchildren or by teachers killing other teachers, public
members coming to school premises and murdering teachers or children, or
schools being vandalised and a lot more disheartening events happening in
these structures. With adequate funds and sound policies, this could be
prevented. Fifthly, failure to transform education to indigenous languages
is a thorn in the flesh to our children, who are faced with two foreign
languages to master, especially in the schools which were formerly for
whites only.

Our children need their languages. They are still faced with a barrier in
learning, which needs to be broken as fast as possible. Sixthly, there is a
lack of discipline in schools, under the guise of observing human rights.
Children sometimes abuse this privilege and the culture of learning becomes
affected. A laissez-faire attitude, or do-as-you-please, has never done
anybody any good.

Imfundo yanamuhla ngabe yinhle kabi ukuba zikhona izinsiza zokufunda
nokufundisa. Kukhona izikole, ikakhulu emakhaya, ezihlupheka ngendlela
engakhulumeki. Izikole zasemakhaya azinazo izincwadi zokufunda. Abazali
abaningi abasebenzi futhi ayikho imisebenzi.

Izingane zihamba amabanga amade ziya esikoleni mhlawumbe ingane ingakaze
ikuthi mbibi ukudla. Ukudla ebezikade zikuthola akusekho. Akukho noma nje i-
soup kitchen, noma isinkwa nobisi. Azikwazi izingane ukufunda zilambile.
(Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The present education would have been better if there was no shortage of
study aids and teaching aids. There are schools, especially in the rural
areas, that are experiencing terrible hardship. There are no books in the
rural schools. Many parents are unemployed and there are no jobs in the
rural areas.

Children walk long distances to get to their schools. Sometimes they do
this without food in their stomachs. The food supply that has been
assisting children at schools has been stopped. Now they do not even get
soup, chicken, milk or bread. Children cannot learn while they are hungry.]

One cannot learn on an empty stomach. One cannot absorb anything.

Izinsiza-kufunda azikho, kodwa konke lokhu nokunye kukhomba khona
ukungabikho kwemali eyanele eyabelwa ezemfundo. Kusadingeka ucwaningo
olunzulu lapha ezikoleni. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[There are no study aids at schools. This shows that the school budget was
not sufficient. Serious research on the subject of schools needs to be
undertaken.]

We need some research to be done into our education process to identify
needs - what they need in this sphere so that appropriate solutions can be
found. Then we will be able to resolve our problems.

Enye into eke yaba nenkinga ngukususwa kothisha ezikoleni beyiswa ngapha
nangapha, i-redeployment. Okunye futhi okusikhathazayo manje yisifo
seNgculazi. Ezinye izingane zishiywe ngabazali kwathi ezinye zafa
ngumashayabhuqe. Ezinye ziguliswa ngukungatholi ukudla okunomsoco kanti
ezinye kube ludlame emakhaya, nokunye nokunye. Sebeshilo abakhulumile lapha
ukuthi kunodlame. Olunye udlame lusuka ngobaba nomama noma lusuke
emphakathini noma mhlawumbe kube yilolu locansi.

Abanye abantwana bafunda kahle baphumelele kahle bese behlushwa ngukuthi
abanayo imali yokuqhubeka. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The redeployment of teachers has intensified problems at schools. Another
problem that bothers us is the issue of Aids. Some children are orphans
because of Aids, while others have died of it. There are children who are
ill because they do not eat healthy food. Others are victimised by violence
in their families and many other things. Some speakers have said that there
is violence in some families. Parents at home can cause violence. The
community also causes violence. It can be sexually-related violence.

Some children do well at school. They pass with flying colours. However,
the snag is that they do not have money to enable them to study at tertiary
institutions.]

They are successful but have no means to attend tertiary education
institutions.

I would like to say to the hon the Minister that lending assistance to
children who have done well at school and have passed well in their final
matric examinations would be highly appreciated by parents, and would also
be an incentive to children themselves. It would ultimately motivate other
children to work hard so as to qualify for these incentives. [Applause.]

Mr A J WILLIAMS (Western Cape): Chair, I would like to congratulate the
Minister and echo what some members said, that indeed the hon the Minister
is bringing sanity back to education. In this regard I would like to
congratulate the hon the Minister on his announcements earlier this year
about the retrenchment of teachers as well as Curriculum 2005.

Daar is egter een aangeleentheid waaroor ek met die Minister verskil, en
dit is die toelatingsouderdom van leerders in skole. Ek is van mening dat
hierdie stap hoofsaaklik gedoen is om begrotingsredes, om binne die
begroting te bly en beslis nie om opvoedkundige redes nie.

Ek wil 'n beroep op die agb Minister doen om ernstig aandag te skenk aan
hierdie saak en die hersiening daarvan te oorweeg ter wille van die baie
begaafde leerders in ons land - begaafde leerders van Khayelitsha tot in
Bishopscourt, en van Beaufort Wes tot in ons plakkerskampe - om hulle die
geleentheid te gee om betyds met skoolbywoning te begin. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[However, there is one matter on which I differ with the hon the Minister,
and that is the learners' age of entrance to schools. I am of the opinion
that this step was mainly taken for budgetary reasons, in order to keep
within the budget, and definitely not for educational reasons.

I want to appeal to the hon the Minister to pay earnest attention to this
matter and to consider a review thereof for the sake of the many talented
learners in our country - talented learners from Khayelitsha to
Bishopscourt, and from Beaufort West to our squatter camps - to grant them
the opportunity to start attending school in good time.]

The Western Cape stays committed to delivering quality education to all the
learners in our province. The Western Cape education department has
therefore identified six critical success factors that we have to get right
in order to deliver quality education. These six factors, which were
endorsed, not only by the provincial cabinet, but also by the national
Minister of Education, constitute our implementation framework for
Tirisano.

These success factors, which also provide the guidelines for our budget,
are the following: Firstly, to establish good time management or time-on-
task across our system and particularly in all our schools. This means
ensuring that all our pupils get approximately 200 full days of teaching
and learning time each year. This is generally below the norm in countries
characterised by excellent educational performance, but well above what
many of our schools are currently achieving.

Our second objective is to introduce benchmarking to ensure quality
throughout our education system. This is necessary to define our current
situation, identify the obstacles to quality and measure progress towards
overcoming these obstacles. Our third priority is to focus on core areas of
the curriculum, namely of the sciences, including maths, science and
information and communication technologies, languages, lifeskills with
particular emphasis on HIV/Aids, and the full development of the further
education and training band.

Our fourth priority is to work towards our schools becoming safe
environments for learning and teaching. Fifthly, we want to focus on
appropriate infrastructural development and, sixthly, we wish to establish
effective school-based management, bringing more authority and
accountability for performance to the place where effective learning and
teaching have to take place. Because we are committed to transforming the
educational opportunities of the poor, we strive to achieve these basic
conditions in all our schools.

To help these factors, it is important that school governance must be of a
very high standard. The South African Schools Act empowers governing bodies
to perform certain functions and gives them a wide range of
responsibilities. Sometimes there is conflict between governance and
management. The former, that is governance, is a function of the governing
body. The latter, that is management, is the responsibility of the
principal and his or her management team. This conflict is not unexpected
as a new system evolves. It may even be healthy as we struggle to demarcate
the separate functions of governance and management. The principal is a key
figure as he or she forms part of both functions as a member of the
governing body and as a professional leader of the school.

The route that the country has chosen to take by way of the South African
Schools Act is one of democratic governance which has placed responsibility
squarely on the shoulders of the legally constituted governing body. The
effect that this has had is that it removes certain nonstatutory bodies
from decision-making within the school. It would seem inappropriate at this
particular point, when governing bodies are about to complete their first
ever three-year term of office, to consider giving any other structures a
say within the governance of a school. What we need to consider, as we
approach the election of new governing bodies nationwide within the next
few months, is to build the capacity of these statutory structures.

We need to take concrete steps to enhance the capacity of governing bodies
to perform the functions allocated to them by the South African Schools Act
with confidence. We also need an advocacy campaign to raise the level of
awareness of school governance amongst parents, learners and the wider
community so that they can become aware of the importance of the
transformation process, and to assist them in understanding the
democratisation of the education system.

The governing body of a school is made up of parents, who must be in the
majority, educators, nonteaching staff and, in the case of secondary or
high schools, learners. It is high time that there was only one name for
all these schools: secondary schools, high schools, primary schools ....

Ons kry laerskole en primêre skole, en hoërskole en sekondêre skole, en dit
moet reggestel word regdeur ons land ter wille van uniformiteit. [We have
junnior schools and primary schools, and high schools and secondary
schools, and this should be rectified throughout the country for the sake
of uniformity.]

Therefore these governing bodies are widely representative of the school
community. The broader community needs to be educated about the role and
functions of governing bodies and needs to understand that the law places
certain responsibilities within the competence of the governing bodies.
Examples have come to the fore of other structures attempting to influence
or even manipulate the decisions of governing bodies. What needs to be
understood is that the governing bodies cannot and should not be
manipulated. They should rather be empowered to take decisions that are
clearly within their terms of reference.

At the same time as educating the broader community as to the rights and
powers of governing bodies, we need to stress to governing bodies the
importance of the decisions they take. The system of co-operative
governance requires all parties to understand where responsibilities are
allocated.

I want to conclude by saying that the best contribution we can make to
effective school governance is as follows. We have to inform parents of the
importance of electing suitable persons to governing bodies and, of
training the newly elected members effectively to fulfil their tasks. By
doing so, we can assist in establishing a stable climate within which
effective teaching and learning can take place.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, at any given
time, the effectiveness of an education system is not judged only on its
theoretical programmes, but also on how it accommodates and elevates the
status of the vulnerable and the disadvantaged. It must do so in such a way
that it is innovative enough to ensure a correlation between the
expectations of industry and society and the output of the educational
institutions.

The objectives of adult basic education and training or outcomes-education
programmes could be meaningless to our people unless these programmes can,
for example, enhance the productivity of the emerging sugar cane farmer in
the Nkomazi region and, indeed, unless we can prove to the retrenched
welder from Breyten that the closure of the Ermelo mines does not
necessarily entail the end of his productive life. It is also incumbent on
us to demonstrate to our communities that the RDP is not only about
development of urban areas, but has rural development as its priority.

The department of education in Mpumalanga hopes to reach the ideal
situation by the year 2008, when every learner will enjoy attending a
properly built school with infrastructure, equipment and relevant staff.
With the advent of the newly demarcated municipal and district council,
this noble idea could be realised sooner than the year 2008. Before 1994,
the absence of communication and common strategy between education,
industry and civil society led to the anomaly in the training of educators
and the erratic curricula. The democratic Government has taken several
initiatives to remedy this legacy.

Since our province of Mpumalanga has no university, the
university/technikon education task team has reached an agreement with some
universities and technikons to roll out more satellite programmes of their
faculties to the province. All the existing teacher-training colleges have
agreed that this year will be the final year for all teacher training. By
2001, these colleges, together with the two agricultural colleges, will be
transformed into institutions of further education and training.

If I were to speak about my province, I would need at least a whole day.
But since I have only been given a few minutes, I will only highlight a few
issues.

I found that we have almost the same number of learners in our public and
private school systems as the Western Cape. While it is never a good idea
to compare a rural province to an urban province because of the unique
challenges faced by the disparate circumstances, I nonetheless thought it
important, at least at a superficial level, to draw a comparison.

The statistics show that in 1999 we had about 930 000 learners in our
schools, while the Western Cape had about 963 000 for the same period. Our
learner-teacher ratio was 35:1, while the Western Cape had a 31:5 ratio.
The money allocated to our province was about R14 million and to Western
Cape it was about R15 million. About 91% of this money in our province was
spent on personnel costs.

If we look at the final comparison, that of matric enrolment versus matric
results, we see a huge disparity between these two provinces. Of the 38 236
learners who wrote matric, 19 766, which is about 51%, failed in
Mpumalanga. While in the Western Cape, of the 37 199 matriculants who wrote
matric, 7 896, that is 21%, failed. We achieved only a 48% pass rate, which
is unsatisfactory when one looks at the R2 billion we invested in our
matriculants.

It is remarkable, however, to note that all stakeholders agreed that the
last examination in Mpumalanga was well managed. To make such a crude
comparison and then find a province either lacking or not lacking in
expertise is not to reduce the problem to its simplest form. Clearly, the
two provinces have some crucial things in common, and they are the teacher-
learner ratios and money allocations. They have also had disparate
outcomes. But I think that we in Mpumalanga can learn that we have to
manage our school system better, even given the unique challenges facing
our very rural province.

We, just like every other province, have promised our parents and learners
the best schooling in the world through transformative legislation and our
very progressive Constitution. Now, all our energies should be focused on
delivering on those promises. Our President's message on service delivery
was very clear. With that in mind, I believe that one of the first things
that we should do is acknowledge that we must produce better matric
results.

As a province we have to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate the
role all three spheres of government can play in service delivery. We have
to engage in large-scale collaborative efforts to improve our schools, not
only in quantity, but in quality, both physically and academically. At the
end of the day, I would like to say to the hon the Minister,
intergovernmental collaboration will be the key to our success.

We cannot hope to produce good matric results if we do not create a
disciplined learning environment. We must ensure that our schools have four
walls, and a roof that does not leak or cave in on our children. Here, the
local government, school governing bodies, parents and the communities at
large can play a vital role. Local governments or district councils and the
provincial legislatures need to meet to ensure that schools in their
municipal areas, and the province as a whole, are fit for occupation by
schoolchildren who spend half their lives on school premises. Rural
provinces, such as mine, find that this basic need is very often not met.

During our recent visit to the Eastern Cape we noticed a very dedicated
principal and teacher who, together with his pupils, swam across a river
every day to get to his school. Situations like these, while they
illustrate dedication and commitment from those involved, are unacceptable
and inexcusable. No South African learner or teacher should have to put up
with such primitive conditions.

We in Mpumalanga, while not having to go to the extreme of swimming across
a river to get to our schools, nonetheless find that learners have to
travel countless kilometres through rugged terrain to get to school. They
have to get up early, and they arrive at school hungry. They then have to
begin their school day. We believe it is within our power to prevent this
kind of situation from continuing, and we want to urge all sectors in our
province to get together to pool our collective resources to improve the
infrastructure in and around our schools.

We need to look at our teachers. In the past week or two we learnt of a
teacher who sold false report cards to students. This is not the kind of
teacher or learner we want in our schools. This conduct is particularly
reprehensible from teachers as they are placed in a position of trust.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of Education, hon members,
regarding the need for capacity-building in rural areas, rural people have
long been the worst educated, least organised, and therefore least able to
demand assistance through formal or informal structures. Yet their ability
to take charge of local government and to contribute to decision-making is
critical to the effectiveness of rural local government.

It is the state's obligation to create access to resources through capacity-
building support. We need to address the problems facing our rural children
who are thirsty for education and have no way to meet this need. There is a
need for state assistance to increase the capacity of district and rural
councils, and for those structures to employ people skilled in facilitation
and mediation to promote organisational skills in rural areas.
It is very disturbing and humiliating that owing to the lack of capacity-
building and infrastructure in rural areas, some learners have to swim
across a river to access their fundamental rights of a basic education for
all. Most rural schools are poorly resourced with equipment, books, and
access to infrastructures which provide electricity and running water.
Learners usually walk long distances to schools. By the time they arrive at
school they are tired, in body and mind. They walk long distances to
schools in which the classroom situation is not conducive to learning. The
teacher-pupil ratio cannot be accepted. Hence, drop-out and repetition
rates are high, and a large number of children do not attend school at all.

Given the prevailing poverty, it is hardly surprising to find most schools
in a wreck, under a tree or shady place and, consequently, offering
education of inferior quality. Education in such places can only take place
when the climatic conditions are suitable for it to occur. On the other
hand, farm schools are built by farmers and subsidised by the Government,
but only cater for the learners of farmworkers.

The lack of resources and infrastructure in some areas is owing to the lack
of adherence to the principles of co-operative governance and
intergovernmental relations. Our Constitution provides that all spheres of
government and all organs of state must exercise their powers and perform
their functions in a manner that does not encroach on the geographical,
functional or institutional integrity of the government in another sphere,
and that they must co-operate with one another in mutual trust and good
faith by fostering good relations.

It is important that the state finance basic education fairly in rural
areas and achieve equity in urban areas. Access to schooling must be
improved to meet the constitutional obligation to provide basic education
for all. There is a need to understand, where possible, and address the
barriers that prevent some learners from going to school owing to distance
and lack of transport, which I referred to earlier on, and hunger. How can
one expect a hungry learner to solve x in mathematics? How can one expect a
hungry learner to balance an equation in a mathematics class? Regarding
disability, how can we expect learners with a disability to be accommodated
in institutions that are unfriendly to them?
Finally, allow me to touch on the safety of educators and learners in our
schools. My colleagues have already referred to this issue. There were two
major conferences on the safety of educators and learners. Four resolutions
were arrived at: One, securing our schools as pockets of safety - in such a
situation we will not have a drunk educator, nor are we going to have a
learner who is armed; two, counselling teams to help those within the
school who are affected by crime or who are perpetrators or victims of
crime; three, environmental design - proper fencing and lighting has to be
installed at schools, as has been done in some parts of the Western Cape.
The fourth resolution is community participation. Those living close to
schools should become guardians of schools. Thus, to achieve equity it may
be necessary to pursue policies that treat different groups of people in
different ways. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, the focus of my input will be on the matter that
was touched on by almost all the speakers, namely the scourge of HIV/Aids
in our institutions of learning.

``Our children are our future.'' This is a quotation that countless world
leaders, academics and community leaders bandy about. What does this mean?
This is the question I want to pose to this House.

My own response to this question would be that our children need to be
nurtured, protected, fed and groomed to take their place in society as
responsible future leaders, educators and parents. It is unfortunate that
we cannot protect our children from the HIV/Aids pandemic sweeping through
our country at an alarming rate. HIV/Aids is real and it affects all facets
of our lives. It is indiscriminate and knows no boundaries, and leaves
everyone vulnerable, especially our children.

We find countless numbers of young people, especially those at schools and
tertiary institutions, being infected with HIV on a daily basis. A number
of surveys show that young South Africans are at great risk of contracting
the disease.

Recently, a random survey at the University of Durban-Westville showed that
50% of those tested were HIV-positive. Let us say that the average age of
these learners was 20. By the time they reach the age of 30, their immune
systems will have weakened substantially. Opportunistic diseases will have
manifested themselves and death will be an almost certainty in five years
from then.

What does this say about the future of our professional skills base 15 to
20 years from now? The picture gets even more horrifying if one looks at
the number of teenage pregnancies in schools throughout the country. This
means that we not only have very sexually active young individuals, but we
also have very young individuals having unprotected sex; and we all know
the implications of having unprotected sex.

Some of these young people will not even reach our tertiary institutions
because they will have died of Aids. A document titled: Acknowledgements
for the 1998 Human Development Report highlights that women as young as 13
years of age are attending antenatal clinics and have been found to be HIV-
positive. This same report also indicates that women in the 15- to 25-year-
old age group show the largest increase in the HIV prevalence between 1994,
when it was 8,9%, and 1996, when it was 17,5%. This was four years ago.

HIV/Aids in schools brings with it unique challenges and we as the ANC have
never shied away from a challenge. We have to approach the problem
systematically, and already our President has set the example by arming
himself with knowledge about the disease. He has spared no personal effort
to ensure that, as a leader of this Government, he gathers as much
information about HIV/Aids as possible.

To this end, he has constituted a national co-ordinating body, the South
African National Aids Council, that will advise Government and bring
together all the research already done on HIV/Aids as part of our universal
effort to find a cure for this dreaded disease.

It will be very irresponsible of us as parents and educators, if, because
of our very conservative upbringing, we do not educate our children about
HIV/Aids and its implications. Their mothers, fathers, other relatives and
even their peer group are dying of this disease every day. Without the
knowledge of what the disease is about and how to prevent exposure to it,
they are doomed to repeat the fatal mistakes of their family and friends.

I am raising all of this so that the hon the Minister and MECs present here
should rise to this challenge and prioritise HIV/Aids education programmes,
and accompanying these programmes should be the necessary human, financial
and other resources. I am happy to hear that R75 million has been set aside
for these programmes and campaigns in schools and other educational
institutions.

The National Department of Education, represented by Minister Asmal on the
Sanac, has presented to the council a document called ``Guidelines for
Educators on HIV/Aids'', as part of the Tirisano campaign which many
previous speakers have alluded to. This document focuses, amongst others,
on the facts about HIV/Aids, the prevention of HIV, sexuality education in
schools and building an enabling environment and a culture of
nondiscrimination towards teachers and learners with HIV/Aids.

Allow me to take this opportunity to thank the hon the Minister and his
department for taking this initiative into our institutions of learning.
The Gauteng Institute for Curriculum Development, under the auspices of the
Gauteng department of education, has developed an integrated approach on
HIV/Aids education in an effort to reduce the spread of the disease in
South Africa. This is an integrated learning programme on life skills with
particular emphasis on sex and sexuality.

One hopes that these kinds of initiatives are duplicated throughout the
rest of the country, and that it will assist in engendering a culture of
responsible sexual behaviour amongst our young learners. I also want to
commend all those other provinces who have introduced similar programmes
into their curricula.

Provincial Aids councils, to be headed by our premiers, are in the process
of being established. The hon the Minister must ensure that the departments
of education play a key role in these councils. If we want to curb the
spread of HIV amongst our youth and young learners, we need to, at a local
level, define a more active role for our school governing bodies and bodies
that govern the running of tertiary institutions.

In conclusion, our future is under attack by a very vicious enemy. HIV/Aids
impacts negatively on the economy of our country and our skills base, and
threatens the very existence of humankind.
There is no better place to educate and generate awareness than in our
homes, schools, technikons and universities and to spread the message of
safer sex and responsible sexual behaviour to our youth, in whom we should
be investing for our future. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, provincial
governments make their own decisions about allocations by the department.

On average, the provincial allocations to education take up 41,5% of
provincial budgets for the year 2000-2001, compared to an average of 40%
last year. Education in the North West consumes about 38,8% of the
provincial budget. This allocation demonstrates the importance accorded to
the education and training of the South African youth.

If we are to fully exploit the abundant raw material with which our land is
blessed, furthermore, if we are to participate fully as citizens of the
world, we need skills that are comparable with the best in the world. There
is an old Ndebele saying that large pumpkins grow in the fields of those
who have no pots in which to cook them. [Interjections.] We must ensure
that we have the pots in which to cook that which nature bestowed on us.
Our allocation of the budget must demonstrate our commitment to the
development of human resources in general, and to the education and
training of learners specifically.

The split between personnel and nonpersonnel expenditure remains
unacceptably high at 91,4% and 8,6%. It goes without saying that the
education budget remains an essentially maintenance-directed budget. We are
proud to declare that, for the second year running, the department has
managed to balance its books.

Given the above imperatives, this budget will be geared towards the
implementation of policy and enhancing service delivery in the context of
Batho Pele. To this end the department is sufficiently stabilised and well
positioned to support schools. The department has, over the past two years,
registered commendable progress with regard to addressing the problem of
transport. A good number of our professional support staff are now able to
render the necessary support to schools. We remain confident that this
development will translate into tangible benefits for our learners.

This year, the budget will focus on the following areas of policy and
delivery in accordance with Tirisano, which means ``working together'',
that is, working together to build a South African education and training
system for the 21st century. We have developed a five-year plan to
implement our call to action, as set out last July. This plan organises the
hon the Minister's nine priorities into five action programmes: Firstly,
HIV/Aids; secondly, school effectiveness and teacher professionalism;
thirdly, literacy; fourthly, further education and training, and higher
education in the case of the national department and fifthly,
organisational effectiveness of the provincial department and the national
department.

Our declared priorities for the financial year 2000-01 take their mandate
and direction from the progressive political leadership of this country,
which has identified education and training as a top priority for meeting
the broader development and transformation challenges confronting our
country. As a province and, in particular, as a department of education, we
must accelerate the implementation of programmes and policies in a manner
that will impact directly on the lives of ordinary people.

In the coming years we will focus on improving access to affordable,
quality education and training for the most vulnerable and marginalised
sections of our communities. Our education system will be judged by our
ability to prepare our people for a full and active citizenship and
nationhood, to accommodate and accelerate our diversity and rich heritage,
to develop and support innovation in the learning and teaching process to
utilise technology and to enhance teaching and learning.

In conclusion, the communities must take ownership of schools. We must
systematically reduce and ultimately eliminate the conditions of physical
degradation of our schools. Vandalism continues to erode our efforts to
provide decent and adequate infrastructure. Thus, funds which could be
utilised to develop actual education have to be redirected towards endless
repairs and renovations. The professional quality of our teachers must be
constantly improved and upgraded. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, I welcome the contributions of the
provinces, all of which provided provincial-specific perspectives to the
challenges identified in my own overview. Can I therefore say at the
beginning that education touches all of us in a way that very few areas of
life impinge on our consciousness.

Regrettably, the greatest success of apartheid was not only Bantu
education, but in fact the way in which education was treated as an
ideological weapon of subjugation and the encouragement of inferiority.

I have learnt a great deal in nine months. I have been an educationist all
my life. I have been writing about education and apartheid all my life.
However, until I saw the reality of the effects of apartheid education, I
did not realise the enormous success of apartheid.

Let me begin with the first respondent, Comrade Kgware, who talked about
the inequalities in education. I say this because I have now identified six
or seven points or principles from this debate. It was a very rich debate.
I do not want to compare this to the National Assembly, but it has been a
very rich debate. I am open to discussing individual items with hon
members. I have taken detailed notes on each participant's comments. In the
20 minutes that I have, I cannot answer every one of those points raised,
but I will interact with hon members regarding points raised here.

We begin with the question of inequalities. Mr Kgware mentioned pervasive
inequalities. In 1994, we found enormous inequalities existing between
province and province. Teacher deployment was necessitated to bring equity
into the system, with the agreement of the unions and of nearly all the
provinces, except one, where legal action was taken. This will now be
completed.

However, deployment still continues. About 40 000 teachers retire, die or
do something else every year. There will be a permanent process of
redeployment, except that now it will not be on the closed list, it will be
on the open list. We want to attract younger teachers with a commitment to
teaching.

The inequality is still there. We have reduced the inequality between
province and province by 60%, using budgetary means. However, within a
province, there are enormous inequalities, and the norms and standards for
funding were used - in some provinces this was done unwillingly - to
actually transfer resources to the schools deprived of infrastructure or
teaching materials so that we bring better equality within it.

Of course, it is very important to note that the inequality was buttressed
and increased by the enormity of the floods and the tornadoes that hit us.
In nearly five or six provinces, there were floods or tornadoes that have,
in fact, worsened the position. The terrible trouble is, as we found with
the tornado in Cape Town, that it is the poorest of the poor who suffer
from the effect of floods and tornadoes, not middle-class people or people
like us, and the inequality follows as a result of this.

So the first point to remember is that the challenge of inequality is still
something we must meet, and we must do so in the same way that we have
addressed inequality in other areas.

The second point is that we have to be self-critical. This is particularly
related to Mr Raju's comment. He was a student of mine many years ago.
[Laughter.] It is one of the perversities of history that I have to address
myself to a former student of mine. [Laughter.] Therefore I will not adopt
a pedagogic tone here. I think to be self-critical of the changes occurring
within a province is not to subvert your party's position, or to destroy
the gains that we have made, because it is not only doom and gloom.

There are enormous changes that have taken place in the last five years,
and with Tirisano, it has permeated nearly every area of life in South
Africa. In the Gauteng province, where I must have addressed at least 8 000
people at three different meetings, there is an infusion of enthusiasm and
involvement.

However, we must remember this infusion of involvement does not touch every
part of our society, because we should remember that the inequalities
resulted because of historical investment. Therefore one finds that some of
the state schools in South Africa are the best schools in the world, not
because there is greater genius in the architecture or the development, but
because the necessary investment took place in those schools. Those schools
must now be brought into the loop, as I will try to show.

So, to be self-critical, whether it is in fact to look at the review of
outcomes-based education, is a matter of strength for us, because we are
giving absolute priority to education. To be self-critical means that we
have to now review the technical colleges, because the technical colleges
provide that intermediate education which nobody has mentioned here.

There are more than 150 technical colleges, largely run on an
underresourced basis. Their assumptions are out of date with our needs
today. Their demographic representation does not reflect our democratic
needs, and therefore we are spending R120 million, with the assistance of
business trusts, in looking at the whole structure of technical colleges.

I will reduce them to larger technical colleges, about 50 to 60 in the
whole country, integrate them and bring them in line with the needs of the
technological revolution and the globalised world. So there are very
exciting things happening which we should be aware of as public
representatives. Self-criticism is vital and self-criticism, in fact,
involves a real look at what is happening on the ground. The third point I
want to make is that the composition of our schools is changing not only in
the urban areas, but in some of the rural areas. The reaction from the
previous groups, whether they be Indian, coloured or white, is often a
negative one when the composition of schools is changing. This is a
remarkable challenge that we face. However, we have a more open, accessible
school system.

We are overcoming the real violence of the Group Areas Act, where one went
to school in the same area, one went to the hospital in the same area, one
went to clinics in the same area. Often one got jobs in the same area.
These were all racially demarcated. Now we are formally integrating our
schools. But do we know what is happening in the schools where the
composition has changed? That is why I asked Prof Wilmot James, the Dean of
Humanities at the University of Cape Town, to look at the value system in
our schools and, particularly, at sensitivity about language and language
teaching and how mother-tongue instruction can be used to exclude people
who are entitled to attend those schools.

In the same way, the Council of Ministers will look at the catchment area
for schools because often the catchment area is used to exclude people from
the facilities that are found in schools. The change in nature of our
schools is something to celebrate for us. It really gives rise to real
challenges that we face and, I think, public representatives should be
aware of the need for active involvement to educate our own people - I do
not mean people of one's own race and one's own culture and language, but
people one represents - about the need for the diversity of culture, the
diversity of language and the diversity of religion. That is why I am
looking at the whole question of religion in schools, because religion
plays such an important part in the ethical, moral development of our
people. However, it must never be used to exclude people, to make young
people feel like outsiders in the school. Again, I say, these are the kind
of things we are doing to establish norms and standards.

Now, of course, I come to the fourth point, and that is the question of
resources and the provisioning of schools. We must be quite clear about
this. The central Government cannot provide more money for the school-
building programmes, because that is the function of the province. We can
look for more money. The central Government cannot provide more food for
children, because children should never go to school on empty stomachs. The
school-feeding scheme provides food. If it is not working in the province,
then it is a fault and the fault must be identified. Somehow between
corruption and incompetence the food is not being supplied. There is this
provision.

However, we must also recognise that money is not the total answer to
everything - for performance and improvement. How does one explain the
matriculation examination results in the northern district of the Northern
Province that are much worse than that of the southern school districts of
the Northern Province? How does one explain that at one school in Soweto
there was an improvement of 29% in the matric results and at another school
a deterioration of 14%, and they are one kilometre away from each other?
They have the same kinds of facilities, same kinds of deprivation, but one
school had an enormous increase in performance.

So I do not think we must use money as a kind of God from the top - a deus
ex machina - to answer every problem. I ask hon members, therefore, to look
at two things: one is the commitment of all of us. If there is going to be
a mobilisation in education, there is a challenge for public
representatives also. This is a commitment for all of us, not to use these
debates to express doom and gloom, to whinge or to be like Oliver Twist, by
saying ``Please sir, can we have some more.'' [Laughter.] That is very
important, the ``Please sir, can we have some more'' approach.

As our President said when he spoke in Thohoyandou on 8 January, there are
enormous demands on the fiscus. It is not only the macroeconomic policy
that is responsible, although the macroeconomic policy is very important in
order to protect our economy. There are enormous demands on the fiscus. For
example, there are still ten million people without any water, and 30% of
our schools are without water. Therefore, I shall work with Minister
Kasrils to ensure that we have a proper programme of co-ordination.

It is 50% of our schools which do not have proper sanitation and, of
course, half of our population does not have any sanitation, so there are
enormous demands on the fiscus. Schoolchildren have to have roads to walk
to school. In the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape many of the roads have
been washed away, or they are not there. Now, how do we then reconcile
these enormously conflicting demands? We cannot pit Minister against
Minister. That is not the way we can work.

We have to reconcile the conflicting demands by political means, by
ensuring that we get value for money and by ensuring that we remove any
tincture of racialism or ethnic mobilisation, when we take unpopular and
difficult decisions, as we have to take unpopular and difficult decisions.
Of course, what is very important is capacity building, because capacity
building requires provinces to build up capacity, and we are going to spend
R247 million on this in the provinces. We also have to build up capacity in
the national department. We must be one of the few national departments in
the world that did not have a physical planner for schools.

This is a direct result of apartheid because the national Department of
Education under apartheid had effectively no function other than a policing
function. Now, I have to end because the Chairperson is looking at his
watch, but I will use ten minutes of my time. I must say, therefore, that
the debates also involve a whole range of issues, for example the budget.

It is not true, Mrs Witbooi, that the budget has been cut by 2%. In fact,
the budget has kept pace with inflation. What has happened is that the
provincial allocations, decided by the provincial MEC for Finance, may have
been cut. In the Western Cape it has been cut by 0,05% - I think it is -
and that is the decision of the province. In the Eastern Cape it has gone
up by 4% in real terms. So, it is not true, as has been said by the
representative from the UDM, that it is a disaster zone.

There are very interesting demands taking place there, because I have met
the Premier and the MEC in the Eastern Cape and they have made a firm
decision to deal with education as the absolute priority, but the backlogs
are really enormous. So these are the kinds of issues that we will return
to, and I hope that Mr Raju and his party will be part of that
extraordinary effort that is being made, rather than stand outside and
quote antiquated romantic poets, because I can quote you a more up-to-date
one like Bertolt Brecht. [Laughter.]

Bertolt Brecht says: ``When the difficulty of the mountains is over, the
real battle for the plains begins.'' We have overcome the difficulty of the
mountains by our resistance against this crime against humanity. The real
battle has started and the battle is now being engaged. I would prefer,
like the New NP, the UDM, the ACDP and the others, that we should be part
of that large-scale battle for the plains that is taking place. I mean that
very seriously, because we should not say that we must return to quality
and standards. It is not correct that there were ever quality and standards
in my time in an all-Indian school. It is not true that there were quality
and standards in coloured and African education.

We now want to bring the principle of equity to raise the standards, and it
is very important that the presidential initiative report that came out in
1999 is our initiative to look at what is wrong with the schools. The
report says, quite clearly, that we must not emphasise only what was wrong
in the black schools, what was wrong in the coloured and Indian schools. We
must also look at what was happening prior to 1994 in white schools.

I have learned a great deal, as Minister, as to what has been happening in
the former Model C schools in the past eight or nine years. There is a
formality and a formalism; there is an approach to teaching which is
totally outdated.

That is why the former Model C schools have embraced outcomes-based
education. They see it as the most participatory, the most forward-looking
and the most child- or student-centred form of education, and they have the
resources and the training. We must move away from that old-fashioned
magisterial, pedagogic way of teaching that is associated with them.

Secondly, the value system in many of the former Model C schools is worthy
of investigation as to whether there is real integration taking place and
drawing on the culture, the language, and the traditions of all our people
rather than the imposing of one particular value system, which is what
Model C schools have been used to doing.

I say to Mr Raju that one can be curious and learn a great deal and I hope
his party will be part of that great extraordinary learning process, rather
than do as they did with the famous schools legislation - take it to the
Constitutional Court on rather casuistic legalistic grounds. So I appeal to
him, therefore, and say: ``Let us look at what is the quality. Let us look
at what the standards are. Let us look - and I end on this, although I will
engage with all the members who made points - at the role of examinations
in our school system. Now nobody has said: ``My political reputation
depends on whether examination results improve in December this year.'' I
do not care a hoot about my political reputation. To the hon Raju I say:
This is not a beauty contest. [Laughter.] Dunce caps are not in education.

I will engage in the assessment by those NGOs, because it was largely an
inaccurate assessment. But I do say: Let us look at the matriculation
system. We have a highly competitive education system which emphasises the
matriculation examination. But the matriculation examination is not the be-
all and end-all of assessing performance and quality in education. It
accounts for about 15% of the students who go to higher education. For the
other 85% the matriculation examination has little meaning. That is why we
are developing further education and training, moving towards technical
high schools, as I hope I will share with hon members when the legislation
has been proposed.

The matriculation examination is used as the real index of improvement.
There has only been the common matriculation examination in South Africa
for the past three or four years now. All the results we were talking about
before 1996 must be looked at in the context of apartheid. I remember when
I came back in 1990 that in the House of Delegates a member of this House,
whose name I will not mention, said that the results for Indians were too
low and the distinctions attained by Indians were too few and they must be
increased by 10%. Hey presto, they were increased by 10% so that the fraud
of apartheid was also reflected in the fraudulent results that came out.

Now we can say with unimpeachable integrity that our matriculation
examinations are being conducted on a fair and open basis, but we are going
to improve them and we are going to set common papers for some subjects
because the provinces have asked for that. But we must get away from the
examination result being the be-all of everything because, what it tests is
memory work. Memory work - and hon members know this, as middle-class
parents - is done on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings through special
coaching. The memory work is reflected in the universities and technikons.
Whether one is studying to be an engineer or a doctor, one studies by
memory work.

Other countries have moved away from this. Other countries, such as
Ireland, where I lived for 30 years, moved to outcomes-based education and
they found this extraordinary flowering of young people's talents, the
removal of psychological problems and the removal of pimples. You know, 18-
year-olds get pimples because of examination neurosis. I mean that
seriously. We must move away from that highly competitive situation in
which everything is governed by the matriculation examination to a
situation of lifelong learning, to enhancing the capacity of young people.
We can do it. What we want is greater creativity, a little bit more
experimentation. Oddly enough, this is taking place as Comrade Jacobus has
shown in her province.

Can I end therefore by emphasising my firm commitment to public education.
Education is a public good. We have not looked at universities and
technikons. We are going to reformulate and reform the higher education
system by the end of this year because we must. There is a pathology that
is taking place. I have not referred to, for example, the need to change
our disciplinary rules. We will come to this House with legislation in
respect of educators. It will be changed, because at present it is
virtually impossible to take disciplinary action against teachers. We will
speed it up. We will allow for suspension without pay and we will have open
but quick disciplinary proceedings.

Therefore, I say this in the context that there are enormous changes taking
place. I want members to be part of that, for the simple reason that if we
want education for all, if we want white and black, all of us, to reflect
our real capacity, which has never been drawn out before, in terms of
equality, nonsexism, the extraordinary Constitution we have which enshrines
those values - and the most important value is contained in section 1 of
the Constitution, the right to dignity for all our people - then the
educational system must, by bringing in the services and providing
everything that we need, enhance and develop the right to dignity for all
our people [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! May I ask the
indulgence of hon members. Can we spend just ten minutes to deal with Order
No 3 where the hon Minister is also involved, with the understanding that
the hon the Minister and the single speaker we have on this debate will not
take us beyond 10 minutes.

          INDEPENDENT COMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITY OF SOUTH AFRICA BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, thank you for this indulgence. I
act on behalf of the Minister of Communications, who is a lucky person -
she is overseas at present.

I shall be very brief. I take this opportunity to introduce the Independent
Communications Authority of South Africa Bill in this House. This is a Bill
to provide for the establishment of the Independent Communications
Authority, as it provides for the dissolution of the Independent
Broadcasting Authority and the South African Telecommunications Authority,
which were part of the settlement of 1994. This Bill transfers powers,
functions and obligations of the former two authorities, and in that vein
amends and repeals the provisions of the IBA Act, the Telecommunications
Act and the Broadcasting Act of 1999.

I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, to congratulate the
many industry experts, the staff and councillors of the regulatory bodies
for the businesslike manner they have displayed in contributing to the
discussion on this Bill so far. It is quite clear that the convergence of
broadcasting, telecommunications and the information technology industries
is urging all of us to draw the inevitable conclusion that we should
harmonise our regulatory structures, policies, regulations and approaches.
This is what the Bill does, in brief.

In supporting this Bill, members are contributing building blocks towards
the construction of a knowledge-based society that is globally competitive.
They are contributing to the emergence of a communications sector that will
support competitive South African firms with the attendant benefits of
employment, skills development and economic growth.

In conclusion, let me say that this is a Bill that establishes a new
regulatory framework to foster and develop South African networks and
content that reflects the South African experience and cultures. I should
say that this Bill enjoys the support of the entire communications sector,
therefore it deserves members' wholehearted support. [Applause.]

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I prepared a speech of seven pages. I will
try to do without some. I will try to improvise.

The new body to be established will be called the Independent
Communications Authority of South Africa. It is important for us to
understand the constitutionality of this body. Although media services fall
within the provisions of section 4 of the Constitution, they are also
subjected to the provision of section 192 of the Constitution. This implies
that any authority that is established to regulate broadcasting should do
so in a manner that resonates with the objectives of section 192. Section
192 states without equivocation that such a body should regulate in the
public interest, and should ensure fairness and diversity of views which
broadly represent the South African society.

We also say that this body should function independently and impartially.
It is therefore important to unpack the contextual connotation of the
qualificatory ``independent'' attached to the name of this body. Embedded
in this qualification are factors that include but do not exhaust, inter
alia, provisions that govern appointment, tenure and removal from
employment as well as those concerning institutional independence. In this
instance our views converge with those of the Constitutional Court. If the
independence of this authority is not guaranteed by statutes we develop,
then corrupt and unscrupulous politicians, in collaboration with corrupt
businesspeople, will capture and control this body.

When we talk about this industry of telecommunications and broadcasting we
are really talking big money. We are talking of billions of rands that are
raised daily by the industry. This in consequence implies that the
authority must at all times engender and epitomise the fundamental essence
of scrupulous corporate governance. For example, last year Telkom
contributed approximately R22,7 billion to our economy, with a staff
complement of approximately 61 000 people. Vodacom contributed R9 billion
to the economy, with a staff complement of 2 500 people. The SABC
contributed R2,4 billion to the economy, with a staff complement of 3 217
people. I do not have figures from M-Net, e-TV, Bop TV and the host of
radio stations that are found in the country. However, it is important to
note that this industry is one of the major players in our labour market
and that whoever is appointed to regulate this industry must be expected to
uphold certain standards of demeanour.

Let me skip the following section. Section 5 of the Bill stipulates that
councillors of the authority will be appointed by the President, on
recommendation of the National Assembly. Members have severally raised a
concern regarding the provision of this stipulation, since Parliament
consists of two Houses, the NA and the NCOP. Members of the committee have
however indicated that they support the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that
they have concerns about the clause in question. It is hoped that the
matter will be revisited in the not-so-distant future. Let me skip the
following sections. Obviously, members will understand why I am skipping
them; we are running out of time.

With reference to the question of the independence of this body, I would
like to wrap up my speech with a dry joke, told by an ordinary member of
our society regarding the behaviour of politicians. The joke goes as
follows. A man was walking alongside a cemetery, when suddenly he saw
inscribed on a tombstone the words: ``Herein lies an honest man and one of
the greatest politicians the country has had in so many centuries.'' After
reading these words, that man was petrified with shock. He read the words
again just to ensure that he was not at fault and exclaimed allowed:
``Phew! These people are insensitive and crazy. How can they bury in one
grave two men who would never have spoken to each other whilst they were
still alive. Their spirits will never rest in peace and God will never
forgive those who buried them in one grave.'' [Laughter.]

This joke is not a product of my imagination. It summarises the way in
which ordinary mortals, informed by prejudice, view politicians as a group
of people whose behaviour cannot be associated with probity. Whether these
words are factual or not is not for me to decide, but that is how ordinary
people view politicians. We are saying this body should be independent of
people with such behaviour.

I humbly request that the Council adopt this Bill as the majority party has
already supported it. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.
Business suspended at 13:21 and resumed at 14:32.

                   NATIONAL LAND TRANSPORT TRANSITION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! I wish to take
this opportunity to welcome the hon the Minister of Transport to the House
and to call upon him to address this House.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon delegates, the
National Land Transport Transition Bill is a significant milestone on the
road to the fundamental transformation of transport in our country. Its
basic principles emanate from the White Paper on National Transport Policy,
which was adopted by Cabinet in 1996, after 18 months of intensive
consultation. Since the adoption of the White Paper, my department, in
partnership with our colleagues in provincial and local government, has
worked tirelessly in close consultation with stakeholders to bring this
legislation before this House.

As is the case with all transformation processes which are challenged with
fundamentally changing the nature of society, this process has been long,
difficult and characterised by intense negotiations about the trade-offs
inherent to such processes. It was inevitable that the vested interests of
the past systems would resist these changes.

However, I am extremely happy that I am able to stand before this House
today and say that by keeping our eye on the fundamental issue of first
meeting the basic transport needs of our people, the entire transport
fraternity - users, customers, operators and Government - is united behind
this Bill.

As I said, this Bill will bring about the fundamental transformation of
land transport in our country. It does so because the distorted and
perverse legacy we have inherited from the past was failing not only to
address the basic needs for transport, but also to energise and integrate
our economy and our social fabric. By passing this legislation, this
Council will be laying the foundation stone of a new, integrated and needs-
based approach to the planning, administration and management of land
transport in our country.

In laying this foundation, the Bill deals mainly with transitional matters
and the first building blocks of the new system we are in the process of
creating. The full national transport policy cannot be implemented
immediately owing to the need to dovetail it with the proposed new local
government legislation. For this reason, the Bill is transitional and will
be replaced by final legislation within the next few years. In so doing, it
sets the scene for the long-term restructuring of land transport systems.

This Bill is based on five pillars, namely appropriate institutional
structures; planning; regulated competition and the restructuring of the
modes of transport; sustainable funding; and law enforcement. Those are the
five pillars.

By providing for the formalisation and regulation of the minibus-taxi
industry, the Bill will be an invaluable tool to provide order and harmony
in that industry. In so doing, it provides the framework for this important
sector to take its rightful place at the heart of our transport system.
It is not insignificant that an industry which is the largest black
empowerment sector in the economy and emerged out of great adversity, and
which today conveys 60% or more of our daily passengers, will, through this
Bill, be truly recognised, for the first time, for its role in our economy.

The significance is also that through this legislation we codify the
regulatory environment within which the restructuring of the industry will
occur. Important initiatives, such as the taxi recapitalisation project,
will now have a clear and unambiguous environment within which to locate. I
hasten to add, however, that this Bill, as such, does not deal with the
recapitalisation project. That is a parallel process.

As I have said, it is important to stress that this legislation and the
taxi recapitalisation initiatives are separate and parallel initiatives
which coincide once only in the legislation. This means that the existing
vehicles with the existing permits may be used until at least 1 October
2006, and that at a date not earlier than 1 October 2004, the new vehicle
sizes will be required for all new operating licences.
It is recognised that these vehicle sizes might not be appropriate in all
situations. It is therefore provided for in this legislation that I as
Minister, in consultation with my provincial colleagues, can provide for
exceptions in rural areas or for tourists and courtesy services. Apart from
this provision, this legislation is entirely about the transformation of
transport in our country and not specifically about the taxi
recapitalisation initiative.

I want to draw members' attention specifically to the fact that during the
consultative process, the term ``permission'' was changed to ''operating
licence'' owing to confusion in the taxi industry, which was under the
impression that a ``permission'' only related to a limited period of five
years. I would like to stress that conversions of permits to operating
licences, that is to say converting existing permits to operating licences,
will be on the same terms and conditions as the original permits in so far
as the timeframes of such permits are concerned.

In order to provide a bridging mechanism for small businesses or for
persons disadvantaged by unfair discrimination, or to restructure
parastatal and municipal transport operators, provision has been made for
me as Minister of Transport, in consultation with my provincial colleagues
and the relevant transport authority, to grant exceptions from tendering
for subsidised service contracts and enter into negotiated contracts.

Except for planning and concessioning, commuter rail is not included in
this Bill. This is because on the issue of industry structure, Government
is locked into a number of processes which we should not pre-empt. Hon
members will be aware that this is a sector dominated by a single
infrastructure provider and a single operator, both of which are state-
owned enterprises. I am referring, of course, to commuter rail.

Accordingly, in terms of the national framework agreement, Government is
committed to a process of piloting concessioning. A commuter rail
institutional reform study is also currently on the go, and as soon as it
is finalised, detailed legislation in that regard will be published. It is
also envisaged that legislation establishing a rail safety regulator will
be tabled before the House later this year.

The Bill before the House is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 deals
with introductory matters. Chapter 2 deals with matters of national
concern. This chapter focuses on matters contemplated in section 146(2) of
the Constitution as setting national norms and standards and applying a
national land transport policy, and will take precedence over provincial
laws dealing with similar matters. Chapter 2 will therefore apply in all
provinces, and cannot be amended or repealed by provincial legislation.

Chapter 3 deals with matters of provincial concern, and this chapter or
sections thereof will apply in each province unless that province has its
own legislation to replace it or a part of it. This chapter was drafted to
act as stopgap legislation until such times as provinces have their own
legislation which is fully complementary to chapter 2.

Chapter 4 deals with general matters such as law enforcement and will apply
uniformly in the provinces.

The passing of this Bill is crucial as it will enable proper planning by
local authorities and the establishment of appropriate institutional bodies
such as transport authorities to which the total public transport function
may be devolved. It will promote order and harmony in the public transport
industry, and it will ensure greater involvement of commuters and
communities in the various processes to be conducted.

I am acutely aware of the concerns of my provincial and local government
colleagues in transport regarding funding of transport and, specifically,
of land transport. Funding is always a big issue. In order to address this,
we have provided for conditional granting between national, provincial and
local government or transport authorities. I am sure that hon members are
all aware that the bus contracting function has been assigned to provinces
and, with a view to further assigning it to transport authorities,
provision has been made that the provinces must transfer a portion of the
bus subsidy funds allocated to them through the Division of Revenue Act for
the bus function to transport authorities.

Another important issue addressed in this legislation is that of transport
law enforcement. This is a very important matter. MECs will be empowered to
designate officials as road transport inspectors to monitor compliance with
this Act, and provision is made for increased powers regarding the
impoundment of vehicles operating illegally. It is also envisaged that the
Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act of 1998 and the
Road Traffic Management Corporation Act of 1999 will eventually be made
applicable to offences identified in this Bill.

Lastly, this Bill will ensure uniformity between provinces by setting
minimum norms and standards for public transport as required by the
Constitution.

Before I conclude, it would be appropriate for us to pause for a moment to
remember and salute the many millions of our people who, over the decades
of colonial and apartheid rule, took up the struggle on transport issues.
We remember the bus boycotts of the 1940s and 1950s in Alexandra township,
for example, and many other parts of our land under the slogan ``Asinamali,
sifuna imali'' [We have no money, we want money].

We recall the boycott of buses in the then Ciskei in the 1980s which led to
the death of scores of our people at the hands of Sebe's thugs. We recall
the actions of the many commuters and transport workers as part of our
resistance and struggle against apartheid. We remember these events and
struggles not just because they were part of our struggle for freedom, but
to remind us that our task today is to build a transport system which is
about meeting needs and not about using transport as an instrument of
monopolisation or artificial social engineering.

This Bill must be dedicated to those who suffered and died in the struggle
for affordable transport and against a system which sought to use transport
as an instrument of oppression and exploitation.

I would like to conclude by thanking you, Mr Chairperson, and other members
of the NCOP for what I know will be a lively debate and constant support on
this Bill. I would like to thank the select committee, and particularly its
chair, Pemmy Majodina, the MECs for transport throughout our country, Colto
and the officials from my department who have done such an excellent job in
making it possible for us to have the Bill before the House today.
[Applause.]

Mr S E ASIYA (Northern Cape): Mr Chairperson, it is an honour and a
privilege for me to address this hon House. Before I start my address, I
would like to congratulate the national Department of Transport. When we
call them to the provinces, they come immediately. They have conducted two
workshops for us, the last one having been held yesterday. We said to them
that we would continue to call on them, because the Northern Cape is a vast
region. We have only covered one section of the Northern Cape. We want to
cover every corner of the Northern Cape. I appeal to them to come when we
call them.

The Bill basically seeks to provide for the reconstruction and
transformation of the national land transport system of the Republic in the
short term to provide for incidental matters. The capacity of the 18- to 35-
seater vehicles is too great for the needs of the Northern Cape. We know
the Northern Cape is a big province. There are towns with fewer than 1 000
people where we have people operating taxis. If we have these new kinds of
taxis, they are going to impede the development of the people. We are
saying that we support the Bill as the Northern Cape, but that the points I
have mentioned have to be taken into cognisance.

The Bill seeks to recapitalise the taxi industry by introducing diesel-
driven 18-to 35-seater buses in replacement of 18-seater minibuses. The
recapitalisation programme will transform the R15 billion market to a R20
billion industry. This obviously will initially transform every phase of
this unruly industry. It is also a notorious fact that reckless driving and
the dilapidated state of taxis are the major causes of accidents involving
approximately 70 000 people and resulting in 2 289 deaths every year.

Thus this Bill provides an effective law enforcement mechanism to formalise
and regulate the recapitalisation of the taxi industry. We therefore submit
that, with appropriate pieces of legislation such as this Bill, the taxi
industry can continue to contribute to true black economic empowerment. We
should bear in mind that this industry has had a positive impact on
development which will lead to the upliftment of South African citizens.

It is also noteworthy that this Bill will not only recapitalise the
industry, but also make taxis safer and break the stranglehold of taxi
mafias on the industry. I remember that at one of the public hearings, one
person stood up and said that she had a minibus but did not have a permit
to operate it. She was renting a permit from somebody else at R500 per
month, and that person was now going to say: ``Let us register the minibus
under my name.'' This Bill is going to address those kinds of things. That
is why we totally support the Bill.

Should this Bill pass into law, a project will be initiated to replace 126
000 aging, dangerous minibus taxis with purpose-built 18-seater and 35-
seater vehicles. This will qualify owners for a subsidy of approximately
R40 000 to pay as a deposit on the new vehicles.

The other points I want to raise emerged in public hearings, such as that
the Bill should treat different situations differently. In the Northern
Cape, the Bill is going to create problems because the Northern Cape is not
very busy. Taxi operators were complaining about the fact that some people
are going to be allocated a certain route which is busier while others are
going to be allocated a less busy route. This is going to create a problem.

The other problem that they also raised concerns the issue of the 180 days'
grace they had to get permits. They said that because they were struggling
to make ends meet, the grace period was too short and we are therefore
proposing that this be increased to at least a maximum period of 360 days.

In my conclusion I would like to say that we know for a fact that, when
laws are passed at national level, they also have financial implications at
provincial level. We request that, when the Bill is passed, it be
accompanied by a funded mandate and not an unfunded mandate because the
latter impedes the social development of the people. As we know, the
Northern Cape receives the smallest portion of the cake since we get only
2% of the national Budget. So an unfunded mandate is going to impact
negatively on us.

Without further ado, I would also like to apologise for changing the order
of the speakers' list for this House. It was because of the nature of the
problems we face in the province I come from.

I have to catch a plane now. That is why I am rushing and why I rushed the
Whips earlier on. [Applause.]

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Mhlali-ngaphambili ... [Chairperson ...]

 ... we always prepare ourselves to address the House through Madam
Chairperson, but now that she is not in the Chair we have to change it to
Deputy Chairperson.

Deputy Chairperson, hon members, hon Minister of Transport, today we are
debating a Bill which we see as a giant step forward in creating a better
life for the masses in our country, with special reference to the have-nots
and the working class in this country. It is with a deep sense of pride and
confidence that the ANC Government has proven, again, that it is able and
willing to deliver the mandate conferred upon it by the electorate.

Notably, this Bill is a culmination of intensive processes that have
unfolded over the past five years. Intensive consultations have been
conducted with stakeholders, namely commuters, bus operators, bus companies
and the taxi industry, through the useful means of public hearings.

The same Bill seeks to restructure the entire public transport system to
ensure integration of different modes of transport into the system. It also
ensures that a small bus operator from Ntabankulu or Sterkspruit, or a taxi
operator from Soweto, can benefit from this Bill.
The era of protectionist policies whereby the apartheid regime protected
the bus and rail industries by means of heavy subsidies to enable them to
outcompete the taxi industry has come to its last moments today. This Bill
is levelling the playing fields in the transport sector to allow equitable
access to the market.

We have received mass support from communities on this Bill because it
builds mutual understanding between commuters and operators on the issue of
a stable transport system where respect for human rights is the name of the
game.

Furthermore, this Bill introduces the concept of transport authorities who
will effectively be the drivers of the implementation of transport policy
at local level. The role of these bodies is of critical significance as it
places emphasis on transport as the nodal point in local government
development.

This Bill also introduces less-than-9-seater, 18-seater, 35-seater and even
46-seater vehicles. This should accommodate the Northern Cape's demands.
This means that the introduction of the purpose-built vehicles takes into
account critical safety issues.
Echoing the words of the President, allow me to send a strong word of
caution to all those who think that they will intimidate this House into
making wrong decisions in order to achieve their covert political agendas.

The monopoly of routes will come to an end, with special reference to the
taxi violence or bus-taxi violence in Guguletu and Khayelitsha, where
Golden Arrow bus drivers were killed. Thus we needed this Bill to be
implemented yesterday.

This Bill will also deal with no-go areas where one has certain individuals
monopolising the routes. This Bill promotes and protects the interests of
both passengers and operators. It will ensure that Arrive Alive is not just
a slogan, but a reality.

It also ensures a comfortable mode of transport for those people living
with disabilities, something which did not happen in the past.

It would be irresponsible of me, as the chairperson of this committee, if I
did not wish all South Africans safe driving during this coming long
weekend and for them to ``arrive alive.'' We always say that we must lead
by example. That is why I am patriotic enough not to use all of the 10
minutes allocated to me. [Applause.]

Chief M L MOKOENA: Mr Chairperson, there was a time in this country when
the transport industry was in chaos. There was no proper control over this
industry. The question I am asking myself is why the previous government
applied a we-do-not-care or a wait-and-see attitude, and why this kind of
behaviour was perpetrated. I do not want to conclude that it was because
they did not have plans or a vision. God help me not to conclude that it
was because, in most cases, only a particular section of our population was
involved in these conflicts.

I hope and believe that it is not true that some government agencies were
fomenting these conflicts. This Government, by the people, for the people,
of the people, deemed it fit and proper to come up with this piece of
legislation. This legislation is the product of an exhaustive consultative
process involving the provinces, local governments and some parastatals,
organised labour and the bus and taxi industries, and began as early as in
1995.

This Bill outlines the manner in which national transport policies, norms
and standards will apply to provinces. It requires the national department
to draw up an annual strategic framework and for the provinces to formulate
provincial frameworks. It also lays down the general principles for
planning that will have to be considered by all involved in the planning of
transport services. Who can think that these noble ideas will come to
fruition by other means than through this democratic Government?

In the past, Government's dominant role has been that of a regulator of
bureaucratic details and a transport operator, but it has been weak in
policy and strategic planning. Of course, what could one expect from them?
We want to reverse this legacy. The Government will now focus on policy and
strategic formulation, which is its prime role. The Government will reduce
its direct involvement in operations and in the provision of infrastructure
and services to allow for more competitive environments.

Government will emphasise strategic planning and bring together key players
in regulatory codes to ensure unbiased regulation of safety and quality in
general, to control market access for transport operators where it is
necessary and to prohibit excessive tariffs in the case of monopolies. Hon
members should please not ask me why this was not done for all these years,
because they know the answer.

Today we are introducing much improved conditions which await South
Africa's estimated 126 000 minibus taxi drivers under the Government's
transformation and recapitalisation project, which is nearing completion.
This will change our minibus taxis into a more user-friendly form of
transport for all sectors of our society, including people with
disabilities. We have to do this, because we are all aware that this
industry transports more than 65% of our commuters daily.

For the first time in the history of this country, transport authorities
will be established near people's homes. The planning and transport
authorities in metropolitan and local municipalities will take over the
transport planning function as soon as possible. This means that most of
the functions currently being carried out by the provincial LRTBs will,
over time, be taken over by planning authorities.

The Bill makes provision for transport authorities and agreements for the
formulation of transport areas. Secondly, this Bill provides for
registration of taxi associations, their members and nonmembers. To qualify
for full registration, taxi associations will have to have been in
existence for a minimum period prescribed by the MEC.

Each member of this association will have to hold a valid permit or
permission which will now be changed to operating licenses. Members of
these associations will have to have converted their permits to permissions
or operating licences. The association will have to subscribe to a
prescribed code of conduct.

My province associates itself with this Bill. What pleases my province most
is the fact that there will, in a way, be some funding from the national
department and even from MECs.

In a very short space of time, the hon the Minister has deemed it fit and
proper to overhaul the transport industry for better use. No one would ever
have thought to come up with this kind of legislation except this
democratic Government. No one would ever have thought of changing the face
of the transport industry in this country except this ANC-led Government.

No one cared about the many losses of lives in the taxi industry except the
ANC Government. No one deserves these accolades from me, except the one and
only, the hon the Minister of Transport and his department. [Applause.]
[Interjections.] The most important thing a father can do for his children
is to love their mother.

My province supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Meneer die Voorsitter, eerstens wil ek graag die Departement
van Vervoer bedank vir die bekwame wyse waarop die amptenare van die
departement die inligtingsessies ten opsigte van hierdie lywige stuk
wetgewing in die gekose komitee en in die portefeuljekomitees in die
provinsies aangebied het.

Dié wetsontwerp is 'n stuk wetgewing wat verreikende gevolge vir die totale
padvervoerbedryf van die land inhou en gevolglik is dit belangrik. Hierdie
wetsontwerp het die fundamentele transformasie en integrasie van die
padvervoerwette van ons land ten doel en is só opgestel om dit teweeg te
bring. Met hierdie doelstelling het die Nuwe NP geen probleem nie. Indien
die regulering van die padvervoerstelsel, en by name die taxibedryf, daarin
kan slaag om orde te skep uit die chaos wat tans in sekere gebiede in die
bedryf heers, kan dit alleen tot voordeel van ons land en sy mense wees.

Die taxibedryf het oor die jare ontwikkel in 'n geweldige groot bedryf en
lewer vandag 'n baie belangrike en onmisbare diens aan die gemeenskap van
ons land. Die taxibedryf vervoer daagliks sowat 65% van alle pendelaars en
is verantwoordelik daarvoor dat 'n groot deel van die bevolking ekonomies
aktief bly.

Ongelukkig is dit ook waar dat die gemiddelde ouderdom van die sowat
130 000 voertuie wat in die taxibedryf in gebruik is, reeds meer as 10 jaar
is. Dit is ongelukkig ook waar dat die padongelukke waarby taxi's betrokke
is jaarliks vir sowat 15% van alle padsterftes verantwoordelik is. Daarom
is dit nie net in die belang van die gemeenskap nie, maar ook in die belang
van die bedryf se voortbestaan dat hy georden en gemoniteer word.

Hoewel die Nuwe NP die wetsontwerp in beginsel steun, is daar tog volgens
ons mening ernstige tekortkominge in die wetsontwerp wat in die toekoms
aangespreek sal moet word voordat hierdie tussentydse wet as 'n volwaardige
wet geïmplementeer word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairman, firstly I would like to thank the Department of
Transport for the competent manner in which the officials of the department
presented the informatory sessions in respect of this bulky piece of
legislation in the select committee and in the portfolio committees in the
provinces.

This Bill is a piece of legislation that holds far-reaching consequences
for the road transport industry of the country and as a result it is
important. This Bill has as objective the fundamental transformation and
integration of the road transport laws in our country and has been compiled
to achieve this. With this objective the New NP has no problem. If
regulating of the road transport system, that is the taxi industry, can
succeed in creating order out of the chaos that reigns in certain areas of
the industry at present, it could only be to the advantage of our country
and its people.

The taxi industry has through the years developed into an immense industry
and today renders a very important and indispensable service to the
community of our country. The taxi industry transports about 65% of all our
commuters daily and is responsible for a major part of the population
remaining economically active.

Unfortunately it is also true that the average age of the approximately 130
000 vehicles that are in use in the taxi industry already exceeds 10 years.
It is also true, unfortunately, that the road accidents in which taxis are
involved are responsible for about 15% of all road deaths annually. That is
why it is not only in the interest of the community, but also in the
interest of the industry's survival that it should be organised and
monitored.

Although the New NP supports the Bill in principle, there are nevertheless
in our view serious shortcomings in the Bill that should have to be
addressed in the future before this interim Act is implemented as a full-
fledged Act.]

This Bill does not fully address the issue of funding. To say the least, it
is very vague about it. Part 6 of the Bill provides for the interim funding
arrangements and it merely regulates the financial affairs of the transport
authorities. Clause 15 states that the Minister may make money available to
provinces, transport authorities or municipalities. Clause 16 states that
the MECs may provide funds to land transport with money received from the
Minister or appropriated by the relevant provincial legislatures for that
purpose. Clause 17 states that municipalities may provide funds for road
transport.

It was indeed encouraging to hear from the Minister today that conditional
grants to the provinces will be considered.

Daar is egter geen fondsbestuurliggame in plek in die provinsies vir
hierdie doel nie, en hierdie wetsontwerp maak ook nie voorsiening daarvoor
nie. Volgens ons mening is dit 'n leemte in hierdie wetsontwerp dat daar
geen spesifieke aanduiding is wat die bron van inkomste is, en hoe die
fondse bestuur en aangewend moet word nie.

Ek wil vandag die agb Minister versoek om toe te sien dat die nodige
tegniese kundigheid op provinsiale vlak geskep en ontwikkel sal word vir
hierdie doel. Dit sal hoegenaamd geen doel dien as hierdie wetsontwerp, wat
reeds 'n baie lang pad kom en met groot moeite opgestel en geskryf is,
vandag goedgekeur word, en later as wet geïmplimenteer word, maar dit nie
gepaard gaan met die oorplasing van die nodige fondse na die provinsies
nie.

Al die bepalings in die wetsontwerp, rakende onder andere die definisies
van die verskillende voertuie wat vir die taxibedryf goedgekeur word om te
gebruik, asook die bepalings rakende die uitreik van permitte in die
toekoms, wat onder andere bepaal dat permitte uitgereik sal word aan 'n
spesifieke persoon vir 'n spesifieke voertuig op 'n spesifieke roete, sal
tevergeefs wees indien dit nie gepaard gaan met die gelyktydige
implementering van die herkapitaliseringsprojek nie.

Daar word in die wetsontwerp ook nie voorsiening gemaak vir die befondsing
ten opsigte van wetstoepassing nie. Die wetsontwerp maak wel in Deel 18
voorsiening vir die aanstelling van verkeersinspekteurs, en omskryf die
magte en pligte van die inspekteurs, sowel as die oortredings, boetes en
strawwe wat deur die wetstoepassers gemoniteer en toegepas moet word. As
daar egter nie meer verkeersbeamptes aangestel, en spesifiek vir hierdie
doel opgelei word nie, en wetstoepassing nie baie streng toegepas gaan word
nie, sal dit alleen maar 'n futiele oefening wees. Al die goeie bedoelings
van hierdie wetsontwerp en die harde werk sal dan tevergeefs en 'n
vermorsing van die belastingbetalers se geld wees.

Ek glo dat as daar aandag gegee word aan die genoemde tekortkominge in die
wetsontwerp, en as hierdie wetgewing geïntegreerd met die
herkapitaliseringsprojek plaasvind, kan sukses wel behaal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are no fund management bodies in place for this purpose in the
provinces, however, and this Bill does not provide for them either. In our
view it is a shortcoming in this Bill that there is no specific indication
of the source of the income, and how the funds should be managed and
applied.

I want to request the hon the Minister today to see to it that the required
technical expertise is created and developed for this purpose at the
provincial level. It will serve no purpose whatsoever if this Bill, which
has already come a long way and has been compiled and drafted with great
difficulty, is approved today, and later enacted, without the concomitant
transfer of the required funds to the provinces.

All the provisions in the Bill, those concerning, inter alia, the
definitions of the various vehicles approved for use by the taxi industry,
as well as the provisions concerning the issuing of permits in the future,
which, inter alia, provide that permits will be issued to a specific person
for a specific vehicle on a specific route, will be in vain if this is not
accompanied by the simultaneous implementation of the recapitalisation
project.

Provision has not been made in the Bill for funding in respect of law
enforcement. The Bill provides in Part 18 for the appointment of traffic
inspectors, and defines the powers and duties of the inspectors, as well as
the offences, fines and penalties that must be monitored and applied by the
law enforcement officers. However, if additional traffic officers are not
going to be appointed, and specifically trained for this purpose, and law
enforcement is not going to be very strict, it will be a futile exercise.
All the good intentions of this Bill and the hard work will then have been
in vain and a waste of taxpayers' money.

I believe that if attention is devoted to the aforementioned shortcomings
in the Bill, and if this legislation takes place integrated with the
recapitalisation project, success can be achieved.]

I want to conclude with the following quote from a paper presented at the
Saboa Conference 2000 by Mr Harald Harvey:


  The birth of a new integrated public transport industry is imminent, but
  only if all of the role-players seize the opportunity.

[Applause.]

Councillor K SURTY (Salga): Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and distinguished
members of the NCOP, Salga embraces this opportunity to speak on the
occasion of the debate on this important piece of legislation, the National
Land Transport Transition Bill.

The National Land Transport Transition Bill represents the transition, or
rather evolution, from a fragmented, divisive and unco-ordinated system of
transportation to a regulated, co-ordinated and co-operative system of land
transportation.

The Bill correctly reflects the importance of local government, ensuring
its role in the cohesive and integrated development of transportation. It
does so by providing for the participation of municipalities in the
declaration of transport areas and in the formation of transport
authorities, the sole aim being to improve service delivery in the local
sphere of government by grouping transport functions in a single, well-
managed and focused institutional structure. More significantly, it
provides an opportunity and challenge to the three spheres of government to
give effect to the principle of co-operative governance as entrenched in
Chapter 3 of our Constitution.

It is against this background that it is significant that the debate on
this Bill takes place in this forum, which is the central institution of co-
operative governance. The participation of the three spheres of government
to debate this important Bill reflects appropriately the convergence of a
uniform and national objective, which is at the heart of co-operative
governance.

Hon members may ask: What contribution has Salga made in the context of
this legislation, and what contribution will Salga make in the process of
the concrete implementation of the objectives of the Bill? In respect of
the first aspect we are heartened and also humbled by the accommodation of
our views articulated in the select committee meetings. This gave rise to
several amendments which were supported by the provinces and which, in our
opinion, have enhanced the quality and the value of the Bill.

When the process of drafting this Bill began, it was clear that it would be
a protracted engagement, nevertheless to be delivered in the end. The
process was consultative and transparent, and really allowed for full
participation of all role-players. The efforts of all stakeholders should
be commended, for they have ensured the success of this project of
establishing a law which is aimed at ushering in an interim system of land
transportation in our country.

As Salga, we take pride in the fact that we have enriched the final product
with our inputs. I am sure there is no doubt in the minds of all who are
seated here today, let alone millions of our people, that the viability of
our economy is firmly perched on an effective land transport system. For
that purpose this legislation occupies a special place in the legislative
arena.

A notable part of the legislation is the regulation and control of the taxi
industry, which, I believe, South Africa has been awaiting in anticipation.
We do not have to reflect too far into the past to remember ugly scenes of
rampant taxi violence, which caused considerable harm to the industry and
enormous loss of innocent lives. As recently as Saturday, we saw the
killing of a bus driver in the dispute over routes between taxis and buses
in Nyanga.

Much of the violence has its roots in the deregulation of the industry in
the early 1980s, and was fuelled by the lack of effective enforcement of a
strategic approach to the granting of permits. This legislation undertakes
to regulate such a situation into permanent oblivion.

Transport authorities will play an important role in implementing the
transformation of land transport in the local sphere. This means making
sure that government's institutional and regulatory actions mesh together
the needs and demands of transport users. This will in turn deliver a
rational and responsive transport system, which will enhance South Africa's
economic competitiveness and create opportunities for all its people. Of
significance is the difference this will make to those who have been most
disadvantaged in our country.

However, this praise does not come without some concerns, concerns which we
have raised in the committee meetings of the past two weeks. Our contention
is that the funding to municipalities to ensure successful implementation
of this law at local government level should be clearly spelt out in the
proposed legislation. If this is not achieved, the spectre of unfunded
mandates may not be successfully expunged from our minds. Local government
cannot be set up to fail by the devolution of functions which are not
accompanied by the necessary funding.
This Bill has set in motion the long-term restructuring of land transport
in our country. We are satisfied that the consultative process has been
extensive and inclusive. As organised local government, we support the Bill
and we commit ourselves alongside other spheres of government to ensuring
its successful implementation.

In addition, Salga can also assist substantially and substantively in
developing uniform norms and standards throughout the country. We look
forward to participating very vigorously in shaping the final legislation,
which will replace this Bill in three years' time.

I wish to take the liberty, at this point, of deviating from my speech and
making reference to the coming few days, the Easter weekend. The history of
this period leaves us holding our breath at the expected death toll on our
national roads. It is precisely for that season that I join the Minister in
calling all South Africans to be responsible road users. As a country, we
cannot afford any more deaths on the roads and we say enough is enough and
no more.

Ensuring the success of the Arrive Alive campaign is a national duty of all
South Africans. I take this opportunity to wish everyone in this House, and
our society at large, a happy and safe Easter period. Let us make our
country a winner. Arrive alive!

In conclusion, we wish to thank the Minister and his department for having
carried out such a difficult task with so much perseverance and optimal
public participation. We also thank the select committee for inviting us to
participate in the committee and the NCOP for acknowledging and recognising
the role of local government in Parliament. [Applause.]

Mnu M MALAKOANA (KwaZulu-Natal): Sihlalo, mhlonishwa Ngqongqoshe neNdlu
ehloniphekile, inkosi ihlala njalo iqikekele ukuthi abantu bayo bahlezi
kahle nangemfudumalo. Masibalule ukuthi lo mThethosivivinywa uyabonakala
ukuthi uyabanakekela abantu baseNingizimu Afrika.

Kade nokho sasifuna ukuphuma ngokugcwele phansi kwenqubomgomo yobandlululo.
Asibonge kumhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe wezokuThutha. Mangiqale ngokudumisa
ngiphakamise umusa kaSomandla ngokuthi ekugcineni izimpilo zabantu
sezizocabangeleka ngokomThethosivivinywa osubekiwe. Phela kuzokhumbuleka
ukuthi ubandlululo lwadlala kangakanani ngathi. Sizwile nokho ukuthi lokhu
kusengumshisa-nyongo nje, isingeniso, isendlalelo senyama, isazofakwa
emathanjeni njengalokhu kwadalulwa ukuthi okuningi okungaba yizikhalazo
noma yizincomo kusazofakwa ohlakeni olulandelayo.

Kuza amaphasika nje kwabaningi kuxhuxhuzela izisu, akwaziwa ukuthi bangaki
abazosishiya kulo mhlaba. Ilungu lePhalamende elihloniphekile umama
uVilakazi like laphakamisa ngendaba yaseKranskop, kwaZulu-Natal, lapho
kubhujiswe khona izimpilo zabantu abangenacala, kwadutshulwa itekisi,
kwabhujiswa abantu abangaphezu kwabayisikhombisa. Ukuba mhlawumbe umthetho
olawula ezokuthutha esikhuluma ngawo namhlanje wase ususebenza, ngabe lezi
zimpilo azizange zilahleke; ngoba uma kulandelwa kahle kungatholakala
ukuthi mhlawumbe ukhona umbango othize owawukhona lapho, mhlawumbe
uphathelene nemizila, le mizila esizokwazi ukuthi ilawuleke njengamanje.

Izinto lapha eNingizimu Afrika, ikakhulukazi kwezokuthutha, bezihamba
lukeke okwenkalankala noma okwelanga ligudla ebusika, ngoba bekuphalala
igazi abashayeli beshayela ngokunganaki ngenxa yokungaqeqeshwa mayelana
nokuziphatha nangempatho yabantu ngokujwayelekile. Nokho masithokoze ukuthi
izimpilo zabantu sezizocabangeleka futhi ngoba umThetho-sivivinywa usho
njalo kanti siyakubona nokuzimisela komhlonishwa uNgqongqoshe.

Futhi okuhle okubaluliwe ngukuthi amandla ngeke aqhoqhobalwe endaweni noma
esizindeni esisodwa, kepha azokwendlalwa asiwe nasezifundazweni.
Bazokhumbula abaningi, ikakhulukazi ozakwethu esivela nabo kwaZulu-Natali,
ukuthi kwake kwaba yindaba le sibona sengathi amandla athathwa ayovalelwa
laphaya kuHulumeni omkhulu phezulu. Nokho sathola ukuthi nathi sinamandla
siyizifundazwe.

Imboni yezokuthutha kudingekile ukuthi ihlale inakekelwe ukuze ikwazi ukuba
yimboni esimeme nenganikela emnothweni waseNingizimu Afrika; njengoba
kuyimboni abampisholo abaziqalela yona. Lokho kungumlando owaziwayo
nongephikiswe ukuthi eNingizimu Afrika njengoba silapha nje sikhuluma
namhlanje, kungenxa yokuzinikela kwabantu bakithi abampisholo ekutheni le
mboni mayisimame. Yimboni le edinga ukuphathiswa okweqanda ngoba inalo
ithuba lokuhlumisa umnotho wakuleli zwe kwesinye isikhathi esike siwubone
untengantenga.

Siyethemba ukuthi kuyothi uma sekuqedelwa uhlaka lwe-recapitalisation,
kufakwe nalokhu esasikubalula njengesifundazwe. Kuzokhumbuleka ukuthi
sasinovalo lokuthi sengathi udaba lwezitimela luwudaba olungazange
lubhekeleleke kakhulu. Nokho siyathokoza ukuzwa ukuthi luyadingidwa lolu
daba ezingeni eliphezulu. Ukubeka umgomo wokuthi akube wuhlobo oluthize

[Mr M MALAKOANA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister and hon House, a
king is charged with the responsibility for the welfare and comfort of his
subjects. Let me make the observation that this Bill shows such caring for
the people of South Africa.

For a long time we have sought total emancipation from the apartheid
policy. Let us express our gratitude to the Minister of Transport. I would
like to start off by praising God for his mercy that people's lives are
going to be considered, in terms of the Bill that has been put forward. We
will all remember how much we were exploited by the apartheid system.

However, we are aware that this is only an introduction, a skeleton, and
that more flesh is still going to be added, as it has been revealed that
any complaints or recommendations will be included in the next draft.

With Easter approaching, most people start panicking, for no one knows how
many people are going to lose their lives. The hon member Mrs Vilakazi has
raised the issue of Kranskop in KwaZulu-Natal where innocent lives were
lost - a taxi shot at, and more than seven people killed. If the Bill
controlling transport affairs that we are discussing today had been in
place at that time, those lives would not have been lost; because if one
can manage to get full information on this incident, one may find out that
there was perhaps some rivalry involved, possibly about routes, which
routes it will from now on be possible to control.

In the past the situation has been very abnormal in South Africa. Many
lives were lost due to reckless driving caused by drivers' lack of training
in performing their jobs as well as in customer relations generally.
However, let us rejoice that people's lives are going to be given priority
once more because the Bill demands that, and also because we are aware of
the Minister's determination.

Another advantage of this Bill that has been mentioned is the
decentralisation of powers to the provinces, instead of concentrating them
in one area or region. Most people, especially my colleagues from KwaZulu-
Natal, will remember that this was once a big issue when we felt that all
powers were being centralised at the national Government level. However, we
later realised our powers as provinces.

The transport industry needs to be nurtured so that it remains stable and
able to contribute to the South African economy, since it is an industry
which black people initiated themselves. Today as we sit here and discuss
issues, we know the popular and unchallenged history that this industry
owes its resilience to the relentless efforts of our black people. This
industry needs to be handled with care because it does have the potential
to boost the economy of this country, which seems to be unstable sometimes.

We hope that when the recapitalisation framework is being finalised, the
concern that we raised as a province will be taken on board. The members
will remember that we were concerned that the position of trains was not
provided for adequately. At least we are now glad to hear that this matter
is being discussed at a higher level. Specifying that a certain type of
vehicle should be designed as a diesel vehicle can also have dangerous
results on people's lives.

Some of us will remember that there was a time when it was specified that
certain vehicles would use diesel. We studied that. We are happy to learn
from the Government, from the highest authorities of the Department of
Transport, that the suggestions made are going to be considered. In
addition to that, and taking into consideration that the provinces have
acquired more powers, we say: The Government has indeed taken a positive
step.

To the Minister, we express our joy. People's lives will now be protected.
[Applause.]]

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, on behalf of the Eastern Cape
province, I wish to submit our input to the process of formulation of this
legislation and finally the adoption of this Bill by this important
national institution.

To the Minister as well as members of the NCOP, in particular the
chairperson of the Select Committee on Transport, the province of the
Eastern Cape wishes to submit its appreciation of the roles he played
during the formulation of this policy. We have consulted a number of
stakeholders in the province, and we secured the mandate of many
stakeholders in as far as the content of this Bill is concerned.

The province supports the National Land Transport Transitional Bill and we
further believe that this piece of legislation will provide Government and
the Department of Transport with a platform on which to manage national
matters as well as provincial interests in a well organised manner. The
establishment of transport authorities and formulation of policies in a co-
ordinated manner does come out very clearly in this policy. The intention
of the Minister, particularly on the issue of support for the provinces so
that development is driven in the same direction in this country, is
welcomed.

The Bill stipulates general principles for transport planning and this is
appreciated precisely because Eastern Cape constitutes the poorest province
in this country and is the second largest province in terms of population.
Recently, we have experienced a number of deaths on our roads due to unco-
ordinated policy development and the absence of well-planned public
transport. We believe that this Bill is going to rectify all these
shortcomings.

We also know very well that this is not going to be an easy process
because, in the main, this is an outcome of the impact of apartheid policy.
As all members know very well, the Eastern Cape was constituted from two
homelands which were well established with different policies. We believe
that this Bill is going to rectify that shortcoming.

Further, the timing of this Bill, especially as we approach the Easter
weekend, should minimise the death rates on our roads. The Eastern Cape has
had a reasonable number of deaths occurring on roads in the past, and we
believe that the discussion today should influence the general public so
that, for the first time, we can save lives on the roads in this country.

The Minister's intervention on the policy of public transport, especially
the formalisation of the taxi industry, is most welcomed. We believe that
the taxi industry constitutes one of the backbones of black economic
empowerment in this country, and we therefore wish to call upon those who
are involved in this industry to utilise this important sector to achieve
that objective.

We further believe that we cannot achieve that objective without the
participation of the broader society. With this legislation the Minister
intends to drive the process of public transport, so that we can utilise
our resources in the best possible manner in this country.

We hope all role-players will take part in the implementation of this
legislation, because it is not enough for the NCOP to discuss the contents
of the legislation. However, I think these deliberations must inform those
who will be practically participating in the transport industry in this
country, so that together we can achieve these objectives. As we proceed
towards the Easter weekend, the Eastern Cape believes that the present
plans of the Department of Transport, both nationally and provincially,
about which we have read in the newspapers, provide a platform for us to
save the lives of our people.

Therefore, we want to congratulate the Department of Transport, and
particularly the Minister, for the intervention he has made in the recent
past. We believe everybody must be part of the process, the transport
industry particularly. Reorganising what was formerly established in this
country is not going to be an easy task. Apartheid was well
institutionalised in this country. The taxi industry at some point was
organised to resist black economic empowerment, but I think this piece of
legislation does provide a proper platform for us to change that
perception. Therefore, we want, as a province, to call upon role-players to
participate in realising these intentions and also to be part of the growth
in this country.

With these few words I wish to submit, on behalf of the province, our
acceptance of this Bill. Again, we want congratulate the role played by the
NCOP and the able leadership of its chairperson in the select committee.
The Eastern Cape participated fully in the content and formulation of this
policy. We further want to say to the Department of Transport, particularly
its staff members, their legal advisers who came to our province on
different occasions, that we appreciate that. With these few words we
submit that we accept the Bill and we support it. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, I have not yet recognised
you and you are already standing up. Now it is your time. [Laughter.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Minister, special delegates from the
provinces and hon colleagues in the NCOP, at the outset the DP wishes to
state categorically that it will support any and every effort of the state
to ensure the passage of any legislation that will facilitate the entry
into the economy of the country of those South Africans who were previously
prevented from doing so by the ideological miscreants in the old NP.

The DP acknowledges that the National Land Transport Transition Bill is
such a welcome piece of legislation, and the party, though having some
concerns, expresses its support for this Bill in the second House.

Before I outline the concerns of my party, may I express some thoughts on
the positive aspects of the Bill. The DP recognises the need to regulate
the transport industry. The commuting public is crying out for a safer and
more efficient service. As mentioned by the Minister and others, the taxi
industry was the vanguard in the empowerment of small-scale entrepreneurs,
and this industry now needs a reappraisal and reorganisation. Unchecked,
the industry has degenerated into a Frankenstein's monster that has been
let loose upon an unsuspecting public. Thus far taxi violence has taken a
monstrous toll in our communities. When, oh, when will sanity prevail in
this industry?
Only the other day, right here in Cape Town, in Khayelitsha, this monster
raised its ugly head. Colleague Miss Majodina alluded to this tragic event
a moment ago. It would seem that the noble philosophy of live and let live
seems foreign to those engaged in the taxi business. The DP joins with all
law-abiding citizens in the country in calling for a halt to the wanton
killings in this industry.

The party supports the envisaged legislation and recognises the need to
create an environment for healthy competition and, most importantly, the
need for the creation of acceptable standards by which public transport
bodies will operate. This Bill is intended to regulate the industry by
encouraging economic activity, creating an attractive investment
environment and ensuring that those who were previously excluded from
participating in this industry, will do so increasingly in an organised
fashion.

What are the party's concerns, if the Bill is passed? Firstly, the entire
control of the transport industry, and especially the taxi industry, will
now fall squarely under the control of the national Ministry of Transport.
The provincial MECs are thus effectively emasculated. Like eunuchs, they
will merely have to implement the provisions of the Bill. The present dual
competence for transport, that is the national and the provincial, becomes
effectively compromised.

Secondly, the role-players in the industry, the very taxi owners and
operators, are effectively being marginalised because the management,
policing and regulation of the industry are now out of their hands.

Thirdly, another major flaw in the Bill concerns the capacity and
appointment criteria of the taxi associations. If only municipal
councillors are eligible for membership, are we not acquiescing in a
situation where politicians are taking effective control of the taxi
industry, when we consider, for instance, the issue of tenders, the
granting of permission to operate, the allocation of routes, the
determining of the number of operators per route, the granting of subsidies
where applicable and so on. The Bill presumes that local government
politicians will administer and manage the taxi industry without fear and
favour.

Fourthly, the issue of the loss of jobs cannot be underestimated. Such
major changes in the whole complexion of the land transport industry must
surely have an adverse effect on job losses.

Fifthly, a disturbing feature of the proposed legislation is the impact of
diesel engines on the environment. Badly maintained or unserviced vehicles
could only exacerbate the pollution problems that the public will have to
suffer.

Sixthly, why is such a conspicuous bias shown in favour of road transport?
The good old rail trains and trucks are being totally ignored and consigned
to the scrapheap of history, like the horse and carriage of the halcyon
days of yore. Surely more holistic public transport legislation, without
such imbalances, could be proposed.

These are the concerns of the DP, but good South Africans as we in the DP
are, we support the proposed legislation. In conclusion, the DP wishes all
a happy Easter and ultra-safe driving. Drive alive and arrive alive! [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, Minister of Transport, Comrade Dullah Omar -
it looks as if he is not here - and hon members, I am definitely not going
to be diverted by Mr Raju's uninformed and unresearched speech, because I
do not have enough time to do that. I think the Minister will be able to
deal with some of those concerns, although I do not know where they come
from.

The Bill before us is monumental in that it adds yet another pillar to
support our fundamental principles of transformation and restructuring.
That is the fundamental pillar of the ANC and the ANC-led Government. This
it seeks to achieve, for the first time in the history of our public
transport, by providing a safe, reliable, effective and fully integrated
transport operation and infrastructure, which will best meet the needs of
passenger customers at improved levels of service and costs, and in a
fashion which supports Government strategies for economic and social
development, whilst being environmentally safe and economically
sustainable.

May I also mention that although the issue of operating licences for the
undertaking of public transport has been set out exhaustively in this Bill,
I think that it is in the best interests of the Council that I confine
myself to the stipulated restrictions and exclusions, and the transfer of
the existing permissions or permits.
The Bill provides that each MEC must establish a single operating licences
board for the province, with members who are impartial and have no
financial interest in the public transport industry. The old adage of the
rules of natural justice which says that no one can be a judge in their own
case will not only be adhered to, but also be manifestly and undoubtedly
practised. Such operating licences boards will be responsible for dealing
with applications for the granting, renewal, amendment or transfer of
operating licences.

A province will be able to make laws providing for the functions of the
board to be transferred to similar bodies to be established by transport
authorities, in respect of applications related to transport within their
transport areas. However, this will only be done if the MEC is satisfied
that the particular transport authority is competent to do so and is
performimg its functions satisfactorily.

The board will be able to establish satellite offices in regions of the
province for the convenience of the public. The satellite offices will
assist the public in making applications for operating licences, receive
applications and issue permits and distinguishing marks to be placed on
vehicles.

This Bill will ensure that no one will be entitled to a new operating
licence as of right. Every applicant will be granted or refused an
operating licence in terms of transport plans, subject to the
recommendations of the planning authorities.

Only one operating licence will be issued per vehicle. Persons directly
involved in evaluating applications related to licences, preparing
licensing strategies, processing applications for registration or
undertaking law enforcement related to public transport, may not hold
operating licences. Operating licences may not be hired out to other
persons as has been happening.

A significant change from the status quo is that operators conveying
learners and students will require permission, except for once-off tours,
where the educational institution owns the vehicle or it has been set aside
for the use of that institution.

The functions of an operating licences board are to receive, consider and
decide on or otherwise dispose of applications for the granting of
operating licences for interprovincial transport involving the province for
which the oparating licences board has been established, or an operating
licence of another province in which passengers are picked up or set down.

An operating licences board, on application made to it by the holder of any
permit at any time before the day on which the permit lapses in terms of
this Bill, may convert the permit to an operating licence in terms of this
Bill and relevant provincial laws, if it would have had jurisdiction if the
applicant had applied for an operating licence involving the same kind of
transport.

After 1 October 2004, no new operating licence may be granted for vehicles
other than the new approved ones, whether as a new operating licence or by
way of renewal, amendment or transfer of an existing operating licence or
permit.

The MEC, by notice in the provincial Gazette, will determine a date by
which all permits must have been converted for the purposes of this Bill.
The MEC will be able to defer that date in consultation with the Minister.
Any permit not so converted within that time will lapse. Holders of permits
will not be able to convert them to operating licences unless the permit is
active in the sense that the services authorised by the permit have been
provided for uninterruptedly for a period of at least 180 days before
application is made for conversion.

I agree with the chairperson of the committee and other speakers that over
the past few years we have experienced taxi violence and conflicts in which
a number of our people, particularly Africans, were affected. This was so
owing to our weak system of regulation or no regulation at all by the
previous government.

Secondly, the conditions and age of the current taxis leave much to be
desired. Amongst other things, these taxis were not built for passenger
transport. They were simply family cars.

As the Minister has said, this Bill seeks to formalise and regulate the
minibus-taxi industry and also promote order and harmony. It will not allow
a situation like the one in Khayelitsha and Guguletu. It will fundamentally
transform the industry over the next five years. By the year 2006, only
specified vehicles as encapsulated in clause 31(1) of this Bill, will be
allowed to operate as public transport, unless the Minister, obviously in
consultation with MECs, directs otherwise by notice in the Gazette.
[Applause.]

Mr G MADODA (North West): Chairperson, I hope I am audible.

Hon Minister and delegates, for far too long our country has cried out for
a comprehensive overhaul of our public transport system. We have seen
bloody and drawn-out internal strife within the system. Road carnage which
is a result of often preventable accidents, both in the bus and taxi
industries, has reached painfully high proportions.

Apart from failing to provide user-friendliness and safety, our public
transport system has contributed very little to the critical efforts for
national integration and planning and development, and for peace and
stability in our nation.

This Bill will bring about long-awaited change to all these problems. It
will protect the user, increase effectiveness and efficiency, and bring
about stability and harmony. We believe that the devolution of functions to
municipal areas, through the establishment of transport authorities, will
bring about improved administration and management of the public transport
system.

More than 70% of the North West province is rural. Roads in these areas are
extremely bad, not only because of the recent floods, but also because of
what we inherited. Public transport to these areas is virtually
inaccessible, and where it is accessible, it remains very difficult for
both transport users and transport operators. We believe that transport
authorities will be better placed to tackle problems such as these. With
improved vertical and horizontal co-ordination, these problems will not
escape us.

This Bill is fairly comprehensive. What to me appears to be more important
is how prepared provinces and the relevant authorities will be to implement
its provisions. While the important areas of the formulation of
regulations, the funding of transport authorities and training, especially
of managers and transport authorities, as well as related concerns, have
been addressed through this Bill, we need to make sure that we move into
the implementation mode of this Bill with enough capacity, given the ever-
emerging problems, especially in the taxi and bus industry.

This means that we need to move along with everyone involved. We need to
continue to sustain the consensus that has already been built on this
massive change. We need to start to work on co-ordination as early as at
this point in time. We also need to ensure that we have enough enforcement
capacity when we implement this Bill. We are happy that the timeframes that
have been placed on the implementation of this Bill afford enough time to
everyone to plan and prepare in good time.

In conclusion, the North West congratulates the Minister and his staff on
this important piece of legislation. It is indeed a tribute to all those
who continue to fall victim to the chaotic transport system that we have
inherited. It is for this reason that we say that this new system must not
fail; it must succeed.

We support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members of this House,
I thank you.
First and foremost, I would like to register the UDM's acceptance of this
Bill on the grounds that its intended purpose is to restore order and
ensure peace within the transport industry.

However, I would like to share with the Minister a few observations I have
made on this Bill. Firstly, part 6 provides that the Minister may make
funds available to the provinces for the purpose of carrying out land
transport activities. The Bill further provides that the national Ministry
may also make funds available directly to the transport authorities for
land transport activities. Parallel to these two provisions, the provinces
will also be empowered to make money received available to the transport
authorities for the same purpose.

I detect here an element of double standards that might arise and lead to
repercussions in the process. One would therefore argue that only one
source of channelling funds should be effected, preferably through the
MECs' offices, especially given that one of the MECs' functions is to
monitor the implementation of the provincial land transport policy and
conduct investigations into matters arising from the implementation. Being
the policy formulator, the establisher and the funder of transport
authorities, the provincial legislatures should be accorded complete
empowerment and capacity, and not be reduced to the status of homeland
legislatures.

One is aware of the concurrent functions of both the national and
provincial legislatures with regard to public transport in terms of part A
of Schedule 4 of the Constitution. This provision need not unnecessarily
hold the status and image of the MECs to ransom.

One other observation I made is that the smallest portion of the national
Budget is expended on transfer payments, that is, payment for transport
agencies, airways, railways, and so on. This leaves me doubting that the
national department will be in a position to adequately finance the
activities of land transport.

Another observation I made is about a great breakthrough which some of the
people have referred to - that of permission offices, in other words the
offices that are going to be set up in various regions. I think one has to
highly commend the Minister for this particular step, because we are
definitely going to realise our objective of job creation then. Job
creation is going to take place.

I would like, lastly, to urge the Minister and his department to proceed
with this venture. The sooner we get the taxi industry saga stabilised, the
better it will be for the whole of South Africa. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: I hope the Minister feels encouraged by the consensus that
has been building up in this House since his introductory speech.

It has been a long road for the Minister to get to this stage of the Bill,
and it has been a hard journey. It promises to continue to be tough as we
go forward. If we encourage - I am sure that is what we intend to do - the
Minister, it is because it is in everybody's best interests that he should
succeed. The excellent speeches by my colleagues would also encourage the
Minister and give him some ideas. I know that there is a degree of
flexibility as one goes forward, and that the Minister is listening to
people like ourselves who come from the provinces and are closer to the
ground.

The Bill seeks to restructure the laws that regulate transport in our
country with particular reference to passenger transport and, of course,
follows on White Papers and task forces and a variety of studies. It seeks
to achieve harmony in the taxi industry and provides for the Government's
controversial plan for the recapitalisation of the taxi industry.

The whole problem is anything but easy. I wish I could stand up and give
the Minister an alternative. I cannot, I have to say. However, I have some
reservations that I will raise which the Minister can weigh to see if they
have merit.

The Bill, with 131 headings and 18 chapters, which is 72 pages long, is a
fine piece of work. It is a product, as the Minister said, of 18 months of
work. One cannot accuse it of having been rushed or of being half-baked. It
has been available for comment in various forms since 1996 and the
provinces, the metropolitan municipalities and other stakeholders have been
consulted.

I have to say that I am a little concerned when I read in the Financial
Mail that some of the important organisations such as Sataco and the
National Taxi Alliance are still not on board. I do not know whether it is
for political reasons, whether it is a negotiating stance on their part or
whether they are really opposed to what the Minister is trying to do. It is
not clear. We would like to hear from the Minister how he is getting on
with this matter and how Deputy President Zuma is getting on, if the
Minister is aware of it, with those two important organisations.

The Minister has been lucky, if I may say so, in that his predecessor, who
did some of the work, was a good Minister. He was a man who was respected
in this House and we respect this Minister as well as his good intentions.

There is much positive in this Bill, but we have some reservations. It is
not that we are trying to be smart or show that we know better in voicing
these reservations. We have to ask ourselves, since this is an ambitious
move, whether it is not overambitious and whether it is not
overcomprehensive. Are we not biting off more than we can chew? Do we have
the administrative capacity to implement such a profound change? Should we
perhaps not consider doing what the Minister is planning on doing, but only
in one city or province?
I was chairman of the world's leading air pollution control company which
operates internationally and we ran many trials, for example, on ways for
trucks to reduce pollution. The programme would first be run in Miami or
London or some other city and then rolled out if it was successful.

I do not know how much leeway this legislation gives one to do that. If it
can be done, it is something worth considering to see if we cannot, on an
experimental basis, take a town or region that is co-operative and wants to
do something and then try and experiment by introducing it there. After
this, it can be rolled out through the rest of the country if it is
possible.

The industry, as some of my colleagues have said, is, of course, one of the
great entrepreneurial business success stories of black South Africans and
of black empowerment. And nothing we say, when we want to regulate or
improve this industry, takes away from that high achievement, because it
shows that people can pick themselves up by their own bootstraps and can
provide an efficient service with a lot of flair and a lot of enthusiasm,
and so on. The industry has also had enormous successes, and we do not
want, in what we do, to stifle that. We do not want to stifle the
entrepreneurship, we do not want to stifle the flair, and we do not want to
stifle those attributes that have made this industry the great and
successful industry that it has become, with the huge public service it
renders to this country, cost-effectively at the moment.

When we look at law enforcement, of course a lot of fingers are pointed at
the taxi industry and I am sure some of the assertions are true. However,
it is also true to say - and the Minister should know this better than
anybody - that lawlessness is not something that is confined to the taxi
industry. What happens in the industry is simply a manifestation of
lawlessness generally, and we should not be deflected or calumniate the
industry for being a source of lawlessness.

We have to ask ourselves: If we have failed and have been unwilling or
unable to really implement the current regulations in terms of driver
competency, safety standards on vehicles, such as they are, registration
standards, etc, what guarantee have we got that we will be able to
implement this far more ambitious programme in the future?

It remains for us to say that we wish the Minister every success. We hope
he gets on well with Sataco and the national taxi authority. We are, I have
to say, very concerned about these vehicles that the Minister proposes to
introduce. We are happy that there should be specifications in terms of
passenger numbers, etc. I am not a transport economist and I am sure the
Minister is well advised on that. However, as far as the vehicle itself is
concerned, we think it would be better to lay down specifications and
standards, rather than to designate a particular manufacturer, so that we
can, as far as is humanly possible, maintain competition between the
manufacturers which, in the end, upholds and improves standards and drives
down costs. Therefore, would it be possible for the Minister to follow a
specifications and standards approach, rather than to nominate a particular
vehicle manufacturer? This is something we think, in principle, would be
better, if it is at all possible.

Finally, I have considerable experience in the air pollution field. I know
that diesel engines are probably the way these buses are going to go,
because that is the most cost-effective way to go. I know that particulates
coming out of these exhaust pipes are carcinogenic. I know of the concern
worldwide. I know that all over the world people are grappling with this. I
know that enormous strides have been made. We have a golden opportunity to
take this big fleet and maintain the highest possible air pollution
standards by installing mechanisms in the traps behind the vehicle engines
to ensure that in one fell swoop we take a big bite out of the air
pollution health hazard which threatens the health of this nation.

With those few words, we wish the Minister well. We hope he feels
encouraged, and we look forward to seeing this whole picture evolve.
[Applause.]

Ms L F SHABALALA (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members
and special delegates, in 1994 the democratic Government came to power
which led to the new, democratic, legalised political arrangement and,
therefore, to justice prevailing for the first time in our country. The
previous government had a justice department in the country which had no
justice, amounting to a violation of human rights.

The democratic Government can best serve its purpose by democratising
society to ensure that people govern by being involved in the organs of
civil society. Legalisation brought about a new order for our society,
which went through a tense exercise. Through the legalisation process the
taxi industry became close partners with the Government. Hence the concept
of recapitalisation.

Professionalising the taxi industry was critical, as in the case of KwaZulu-
Natal where the industry is run on a survival-of-the-fittest style.

Kuyinhlamba ukuthi abantu baleli bhizinisi sesababiza ngezinkabi. Kwezinye
izimboni sithi kunezimenenja. [It is an insult to call the people who do
this kind of business oxen; whereas we call their counterparts in other
types of business managers.]

We look forward to a moment in our history when we refer to taxi owners as
managers or directors.

The Government, through this Bill, should be congratulated because its
priority is the commuter, who, in most cases, is the victim of any
shortcomings in the transport industry. However, being the custodians of
democracy, we seek to transform every sector. It is a reality that
restructuring will always come with job losses, for which mechanisms are
clearly defined in this Bill.

Therefore, we wish to congratulate the Minister. As KwaZulu-Natal we
support this Bill.

On a closing note, I wish to congratulate the Minister of Transport on
having launched the road safety campaign on the same day that we did in
KwaZulu-Natal, that is, yesterday. This event was characterised by the
presence of different sectors of the community, which demonstrated the
extent to which our society is being democratised.

The MEC for transport in KwaZulu-Natal and the department are bracing
themselves, of course, with zero tolerance, for the volume of traffic over
the Easter holidays, as holiday-makers from all the provinces will be
coming to KwaZulu-Natal.

I think the Minister has a lot of challenges facing him in the department.
It is correct to say he has tried to right the imbalances of the past
through restructuring. However, the Minister will always find people who
will say to him: ``We are correcting you,'' and one just wonders who is
correcting things in this department. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members and delegates, the
process of rural transport planning in the Mpumalanga province will
undoubtedly be a challenging task for all of us. Land development
objectives and integrated development planning have all along been confined
to the urban areas. Many businesspeople and the average citizen did not pay
much attention to these crucial planning exercises. At times they were
viewed as tedious jobs assigned only to the municipal officials, the
councillors and a few structures of the community.

In rural Mpumalanga, the district council will have to execute the task of
establishing transport authorities where there are no municipalities, no
infrastructure development and almost no roads at all. Obviously, research
and extensive consultation will preoccupy the initial planning stage since
no accurate road records exist with regard to the size of the population in
most areas. They will find, for example, that where there are no access
roads, commuters are often stranded and have to walk long distances in
search of transport.
Where roads exist, there is usually an oversupply of transport competing
fiercely for an ever-shrinking market.

The rural areas of Mpumalanga require peculiar transport planning to cater
for the largely agriculture-based commuting pattern with its ever-changing
routes and working hours. These patterns change from season to season and
from sector to sector. For example, the commuters to vegetable
smallholdings, those working in orchards, plantations and mealie fields,
have their own peculiar patterns of commuting, which differ remarkably. In
addition, the transport authorities will have to contend with the economic
decline of the agricultural sector in general.

The objectives of the National Land Transport Transition Bill make economic
sense to us in Mpumalanga. On implementation it will enable companies,
amongst others, to release their investments from transport commitments
into wider job-creating opportunities. For example, the mining companies
and Eskom in Mpumalanga's Highveld areas will no longer have their capital
committed to the running costs of buses and trucks, but will have the
opportunity to specialise in their core activities, namely mining and power
supply respectively.
The same could be true for the tourism industry in the province. Let us
allow the Kruger National Park and other tourist attractions in the
province to specialise in tourism and have less and less to do with the
transport of tourists. [Applause.]

Mr A MARAIS: Chairperson, I have a lot of friends, I must say. [Laughter.]

From the onset I would like to report that all stakeholders from the Free
State are positively in support of the changes enshrined in this
legislation. We also agree that the scope of this Bill is ubiquitous, as
the hon the Minister has said.

The previous government firstly overregulated then deregulated the
industry, with potentially devastating consequences for the economic
viability and sustainability of the industry, flooding it with permits.
What in fact happened, was that the old order generally criminalised black
participation in the economy in so far as it conflicted with the
imperatives of racial capitalism. Any activity that could not be controlled
by whites, was criminal. Thousands of laws were passed to this end.
With regard to the taxi industry, the former government moved from arrest
and harassment to deregulation, that is, from criminalisation to
deregulation, or rather lawlessness. This has prompted us in the Free
State, noting our close proximity to Lesotho, the mining industry and its
attendant passenger requirements, compelling conditions in Botshabelo,
Thaba Nchu and Qwaqwa, and the unacceptable high fatality rates on our
roads, to sought ways that would counter the democratisation of
criminality, lawlessness and endemic violence. Since the mid-eighties, we
have played a leading role in endeavours to modernise the industry.
Strategies such as, for instance, the taxi co-operatives, have their
origins in the Free State.

The Free State Interim Passenger Transport Act, Act 16 of 1998, was among
the first in the country, although its constitutionality was heavily
questioned at the time. Due to this early start, the formalisation and
regulation processes are at a very advanced stage in the province.

At present there are 74 registered associations. The number of registered
operators and vehicles amount to 6 310 and 7 947 respectively. Estimated
illegal operators and vehicles vary from 2 036 and 2 600 respectively. At
present we are processing approximately 2 000 special legalisation
applications.

We have thus far established one provincial taxi office and four satellite
or regional offices and are investigating further rationalisation to
dovetail with the redemarcation process. Negotiations pertaining to the
provincial co-operatives are advancing well, maybe not as fast as we would
prefer it to, but they are well on course. A remarkable record indeed, I
submit.

Invaluable experience gained over the past few years have indeed been very
instructive. A progressive, modernised passenger transport industry
requires high-tech communication systems to enhance its operations. From a
provincial perspective, we therefore propose that special emphasis be
placed on the following: That the registration administration systems be
replaced by more advanced software to enable the offices of especially the
registrars to perform their functions more effectively and efficiently;
that these systems be network based to widen the network area in order to
link the registrars' offices and taxi associations and, where they are
established, transport authorities; that access to the Internet be
enhanced; and, implicit in the former, that access to vast comparative and
pertinent literature on transport and inexpensive means of communication be
enhanced with respect to reduced fares, telephone, travelling and postal
costs to the former-mentioned offices.

We are asking the hon the Minister to intervene to ensure that this type of
development is mimicked throughout. The passenger transport industry is a
business, and the development of a management information system for the
industry will go a long way towards professionalising activities and
conduct. Information technology is one way of dovetailing the practices of
the industry with the rest of the economy. In order to do this, accurate
records of transactions, income, expenditure, etc, are needed.

On training and capacity-building, we are of the view that although various
efforts have been made to provide this, either nationally or provincially,
the fact that it was not monitored or evaluated created a problem. Funds
were pumped into unstructured and unco-ordinated training. There is a need
to move away from eclectic training towards a more customised training
programme. In accordance with the NTTT recommendations, we are soliciting
partnerships with the private sector and taxi industry in the training and
capacity-building initiatives of minibus operators and drivers. There are
indications of the willingness and positive attitude of the private sector
thus far.

We are further of the view that modernisation and other ongoing changes
will have a major impact on the industry and the department. It then
becomes imperative to put especially the offices of the registrars in a
better position to meet the challenges.

I shall now deal with some of the provisions of the Bill. Section 125 of
the Bill, by implication, suggests that commuters should become more
responsible pertaining to the recording of the names of drivers, operators
and the vehicles in which they commute. It is our contention that this type
of information must form part of a national public education strategy. We
are appealing to the hon the Minister to elaborate on this.

Overall, the Bill is not emphatic enough with regard to citizens or
commuter responsibility.

The prevention or overcoming of the overloading problem cannot solely be
the responsibility of drivers or operators. Commuters should be accountable
for impropriety as well. This must be considered and the Minister is asked
to indicate whether there is a national strategy that is being contemplated
in this regard.

The section further provides that authorised officers may order the driver
or person in charge of the vehicle to surrender the operating licence or
permit, or other distinguishing marks. Elderly persons are the most
vulnerable and are always exploited. The Bill is absolutely silent on the
humane aspects, such as in the event that a vehicle is impounded and the
vulnerable are prejudiced. We need to understand what remedial mechanisms
the Minister is considering through, perhaps, national legislation in
instances like these.

We further contend that the Minister moved with speed, with the concurrence
of the MECs and TLCs, regarding designated loading or off-loading areas and
also regarding the regulations providing for national sanctions, both for
the taxis and commuters.

The prescripts of the African renaissance enjoin us to transform our
society, in both a tangible and an intangible sense, towards the attainment
of the ideal ethos. We support the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, let me begin by saying that as a person who
went to seek the provincial mandate on this, I must say that, contrary to
what Mr Durr has said, the province supports the Bill with no amendments
and with no concerns. That is not a provincial mandate. It should be known
that what he said is personal. [Interjections.] Let me come back to what we
are here for. I had to correct that, because it could have been
misunderstood. [Interjections.]

Perhaps it is because I was once a teacher that if I want to drive a point
home, I have to narrate a story. I hope my time will not expire before my
story is done. I want to tell hon members a very sad story. Perhaps some
members will be able to relate to it.

Prevented by apartheid laws from taking his family with him to the city, a
certain man took advantage of the transport subsidies the then government
provided as incentives for upholding urban apartheid. He commuted daily
between Dennilton, in the former KwaNdebele, and Verwoerdburg, which is now
known as Centurion. This afforded him an opportunity to at least be part of
his children's upbringing. He was able to commute every morning and
evening. He had saved some money, and he paid R104 instead of R408.

The then government announced the withdrawal of the subsidy scheme. This
was a heavy blow to this man. He could not survive without cutting down on
his daily commuting to and from Dennilton. He had also invested so much in
his home in Dennilton, and he could not afford to lose his investment.

What he did was that he joined the growing army of shack dwellers on the
outskirts of Mamelodi. [Interjections.] His wife had to join him in search
of income opportunities because of the expense of running two households.

Namalunga ayayazi-ke indoda eyigoduka ukuthi iba nemizi emibili.
[Ubuwelewele.] [Members of Parliament know that a migrant man always has
two homes. [Interjections.]]

She soon found piece jobs, washing and ironing clothes for the middle-class
residents of Mamelodi Gardens. Back at home things were not right, because
...

... akukho bazali futhi abantwana bayazenzela. Akukho muntu okhulisa labo
bantwana. Njengabazali, siyazi ukuthi kusho ukuthini ukushiya abantwana
abangamantombazane bebodwa ekhaya. [... with no parents, children do as
they like. There is no one to bring the children up. As parents we know
what it is like to leave female children alone at home.]

I am saying this so that we have a better picture of why transport is a
necessity. It exists to support a fundamental need of society, which is to
give people access to opportunities for work, leisure and other social
activities.

Transport is also necessary for sustained economic growth and the
maintenance of our country's international competitiveness. Jobs, economic
growth and international competitiveness depend on a smooth and dependable
modern transport system. This is exactly what this Bill seeks to achieve.
It establishes a clear vision for transport in line with national
objectives and provides all role-players in the system with a view of the
priorities to be acted upon. Furthermore, it devolves as much of the
implementation agenda as possible to lower spheres of government, including
the proposed metropolitan areas.

One has to look at this Bill in the context of the benefits which will
arise as a result of its implementation. Metropolitan governments enable
more integrated planning. This is very important, given the fragmented and
piecemeal manner in which the apartheid government implemented its
socioeconomic policies. There was, for example, no connection between its
land use and transport policies.

Apartheid transport policies were not aimed at providing people with access
to job opportunities, social services, educational opportunities and social
integration. Townships were planned and built far from white residential
areas and central business districts where the bulk of job opportunities,
educational opportunities and social services were situated, in many
instances with few or no roads.

This fragmented approach between land use and transport planning had severe
socioeconomic implications for township residents. According to a report by
the Department of Transport's Moving South Africa initiative, the average
public transport trip in South Africa is 20 km, compared with 9 kilometres
in developing Asian countries. The result is that South African commuters
spend almost 40% more time travelling than their Asian counterparts.
Consequently they have to pay more for transport and have less time to
spend with their families and children. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, Part 9 of
the National Land Transport Transition Bill deals with the safety standards
of transporting people every day, which is now a national issue.

For many people the taxi industry was once seen as a major breakthrough by
black entrepreneurs into South Africa's informal economy. However, during
the past few years, South Africa has witnessed numerous incidents of taxi
violence in which many innocent victims have died. Some taxi drivers do not
have valid licences, they overload their vehicles, they do not use safety
belts, some of their vehicles run with smooth tyres, and the worst is that
some of them ignore road signs.

In Gauteng only, we have more than 40 000 vehicles operating as taxis,
according to figures supplied by our MEC for transport in the province.
What were once celebrated as a beacon of hope for black economic
empowerment have become, in the words of our President, ``coffins on
wheels''.

I think all drivers who continue to be involved in road accidents should
have their drivers' licences confiscated and not be allowed to drive again
for a long time.

Although there may be many reasons for continuing taxi conflict, some of it
relates to disputes arising from operators failing to stick to their
allocated routes, fighting over loading zones and ranking space, and
failure to curb violent elements within the taxi industry itself. To my
mind, however, the main reason should be sought in the deregulation of the
taxi industry as part of the apartheid government's policy of distancing
the government from the black empowerment enterprises. The continuing
violence suggests that it is time for our democratic Government to undo the
apartheid government's policies of economic deregulation and political
instability, which led to the taxi violence in the first place.

In March this year, the mother of our Deputy Speaker in the province was
hit by a stray bullet while two taxi drivers were shooting at each other.
She was going to town but she ended up in hospital with a bullet wound that
nearly took her life.

The problem in the industry does not only concern taxi violence. The aim of
the National Land Transport Transition Bill is to adopt a holistic approach
to solving the problems associated with the taxi industry. It seeks to
restructure the taxi industry in such a way that all the illegal practices,
such as those I have mentioned above which are associated with the taxi
industry, can be removed.

The problem relating to taxi industry has been a concern for the province
of Gauteng for a number of years. The provincial government has continually
motivated strongly for the regulation of the taxi industry because the
absence of laws were frustrating the fight against the taxi violence. On 6
April our MEC had to suspend the Faraday Taxi Association from operating
for seven days because of lawlessness. The MEC made it clear to members of
the association that the Government will not be intimidated. In the words
of the MEC for Gauteng, Mr Mosonkuthu:


  The suspension of the permit is not intended to harm anyone but is for
  the good of the association and the people.

Since 1995, we have been involved in ongoing discussions with all the
relevant stakeholders in the taxi industry to find solutions to the taxi
problem in the province, which culminated in the establishment of the
Gauteng Taxi Initiative. The Faraday Taxi Association members behaved so
well that the MEC had to lift their suspension. It is for this reason that
we welcome this Bill. It will definitely contribute towards stability in
the taxi industry. We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, special delegates
present, this Bill is long overdue and in its current state is incomplete
but nonetheless goes a long way to redress a very dire situation.
Week after week South Africa has watched and listened to horror stories
about the minibus taxi industry. Virtually every newspaper, TV news
bulletin and magazine carries a story of taxi violence or violation of
traffic rules. People are being shot as they stand in queues. Taxi drivers
perform driving gymnastics in their greed for more fares, often forcing
others off the road. There are drive-by shootings from rival associations.
Many vehices are in such a state of disrepair that they are literally held
together by masking tape. The list is endless.

Ordinary people who want to go about their daily business are caught in the
crossfire of groups of taxi drivers who believe it is their right to
brutally eliminate competition, regardless of the loss of human life.
Already in KwaZulu-Natal, the MEC, Sbu Ndebele, had to take drastic actions
in the Empangeni-Eskhawini taxi conflict to prevent loss of human life when
rival associations were engaged in turf wars and 11 people were massacred
on 4 November 1999. This Government is a responsible one and will not allow
this kind of anarchy to continue unchecked.

This Government does not seek to scrap the taxi industry through this
legislation, nor does it seek to take away jobs from predominantly black
drivers and owners. What this Bill is doing is transforming an industry
from a chaotic, uncaring and dangerous one without uniform regulations,
norms and standards to one that is regulated and has an infrastructure.

This Bill seeks to transform the industry, not for the sake of
transformation or because we want to ensure that taxes are paid - although
we believe that everyone has a responsibility to pay tax because everyone
actually benefits from increasing the tax base - but because every life is
important to us. We want to eradicate the criminal elements who threaten
our citizens through their unruly behaviour.

We have always welcomed the fact that the people on the ground took the
initiative to start businesses to deliver a vital service where there had
been none. The taxi industry brought a necessary service to approximately
60% of our citizens who were out of reach of Metrorail and the public bus
route. We commend the taxi industry for that service. We also welcome the
fact that many black businesses got off the ground and had an opportunity
to flourish against all odds.
What this Bill seeks to do is not to stifle the initiatives of the taxi
industry but to reduce the negativity which surrounds the industry. This
Bill ensures that all provinces have the same infrastructure and support
base. It also makes sure that the same permits are issued, following the
same rules and regulations. It makes the industry accountable, both to the
people which it serves and the Government.

We believe that intergovernmental co-operation is the cornerstone of this
Bill. All nine provinces and all local authorities will have to work
closely together to ensure that there are proper transport authorities in
place to co-ordinate such functions, preparations of transport plans,
policies and financial planning. Part of these plans should ensure that,
firstly, uniform registration of taxis occurs, norms and standards are the
same across the provincial boundaries, licensing and permits are
standardised, corruption is eradicated, there is better law enforcement,
commuters have safe vehicles, workers have fair conditions of service, and
so on.

This Bill forges new paths for public transport. It reassures the public
that their lives are in safe hands in the taxi industry. It also ensures
that an industry which had previously been allowed to run rampant is now
being organised in an orderly fashion.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, in the little time I have
available, I will respond to some of the queries which have been raised,
questions which have been asked and points which have been made. I am aware
of the fact that I will not be able to deal with all issues raised. I will
be looking at our Hansard, and will try to respond to those queries which I
have not been able to deal with during the course of this debate.

Firstly, I would like to thank all members for their participation and
their support for the Bill. I think that all members have contributed in a
way which is constructive and helpful. A number of suggestions drew my
attention to concerns, and I want to give the House the assurance that all
concerns will be addressed.

The hon Asiya from the Northern Cape raised a number of important points.
Very briefly, I just want to say that the use of 35-seater vehicles is not
compulsory. It is the demand that will determine the kind of vehicles that
will be used. In other words, we are moving towards a situation where there
is a balancing or an attempt to achieve a balance between need and demand
which will determine the kind of vehicles used. So, if a 35-seater is too
big, then clearly one will resort to using a smaller vehicle. When demand
changes and one can use a 35-seater vehicle, it will be for the operator to
decide whether to use such a vehicle.

I would like to make the point that the Bill also provides for exemptions,
and I think that that exemption has come about as a result of the
intervention of the committee of this House. The select committee was
concerned about rural areas in particular and other needs. So there is a
provision for exemption and that also provides rural areas in particular
with an avenue through which their needs can be appropriately addressed.
Many delegates and members commented on the recapitalisation process. Of
course, recapitalisation is not dealt with in this Bill, although some of
the provisions of the Bill do impact upon recapitalisation.

The same hon member expressed a concern about the conversion of the permits
to operating licences which will be route-based. Here also, I want to make
the point that there is no instant change. There will be consultation with
associations. The idea is that there will be transport planning taking
place. There is provision for transport planning authorities, and it is in
terms of those planning authorities that the needs of an area will be
determined and the routes determined. Those are matters which can be dealt
with at a provincial and at a local level, and the Bill before the House
allows that.

The hon member expressed concern about the period of 180 days which has
been fixed for an operator to whom an operating licence has been issued to
actually operationalise his licence, and he suggested that that period was
too short. Now, the big problem we are trying to deal with there is that a
large number of copied permits are floating around today which are being
traded. There is a lot of abuse when one allows a licence or permit to be
issued and it is not used. Now, we want to eliminate that abuse. The second
problem with that type of abuse is that when that licence is not
operationalised, another person can come along and apply for a licence on
the basis of actual need. A second licence is then issued and, in due
course, when all those licences are operationalised, one finds that there
are far too many licences and operators, and one has the same kinds of
problems which exist in the industry at present, which leads to tension,
violence and conflict between taxi operators.

Therefore we have considered this aspect very seriously. All the MECs
agreed that we should keep the period to 180 days. Whilst I note the
concern which has been expressed, we believe that 180 days is a very
reasonable period. It gives a person six months to make use of an operating
licence which has been issued to him.

The hon member also raised the question of funded mandates and unfunded
mandates. That is a very big issue. Firstly, I want to say that, as a
matter of policy from our side as the Department of Transport and Ministry
of Transport, we will never place a responsibility upon provincial or local
governments without ensuring that adequate funding exists for that purpose.
That is a matter of policy. Secondly, in the Bill itself, the issue of
funding is dealt with. Our provisions are not going to deal with them.
Thirdly, I want to make the point that we did include other provisions with
regard to finance in the Bill, and we sought to make provision for
provincial and local authorities to raise finance themselves through levies
and to be able to impose a kind of taxation which will enable them to deal
with their needs.

However, we ran into opposition from the Department of Finance, which has a
policy in that regard. It does not want to see a multiplicity of taxes
being imposed upon citizens of our country, so we were compelled to remove
those provisions from the Bill. I am sympathetic to the concerns which have
been raised and, at present, we are interacting with the Department of
Finance. We have a structure which is called a four-by-four. It has four
representatives from the Department of Finance, and four representatives
each from the national, provincial and local departments of transport. We
meet together in this four-by-four. It is not a vehicle. [Laughter.] In
that structure, we are actually discussing the financing aspects. In other
words, we will have to come back to the financing aspects again, but we
will be dealing with them in the meantime.

The hon Majodina raised some very important issues and I feel that I must
comment on one or at least two of them: firstly, the killing which took
place in Nyanga. I issued a statement yesterday in which I condemned the
killing. I condemned the use of violence, no matter where it comes from. I
condemned the intimidation, no matter where it comes from. I also pointed
out that Golden Arrow is not only authorised to ply in that particular
area, but, in terms of a contract, it has to render that service and it is
entitled to operate in that area. So, whilst I sympathise with the concerns
of taxi operators, both Cata and Codeta, and I believe that their issues
need to be addressed, they cannot be addressed through the use of violence
and intimidation.

Therefore we have also appealed to law enforcement authorities to ensure
that law and order is maintained. My hope is that the person or persons
responsible for the killing will be arrested and be brought to court. For
our part, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the right of
commuters to use the mode of transport of their choice will be protected.
The point I want to make in that regard is that one of the objectives of
our policy, of which this Bill is a reflection and a result, is that
commuters should have a right to use the mode of transport of their choice.
Obviously, we want to see rationalisation of transport taking place. We
want to see our rail transport, bus transport and taxi transport develop.
There must be a balance. We would like to see more and more people leave
their motorcars at home and use public transport, particularly rail. But we
need to make those forms of transport attractive for our people. We cannot
compel them through legislation to do that.

Therefore our vision is that we will be moving towards a situation where
our public transport becomes efficient, attractive and safe for our people.
We will not allow any kind of violence, and we want to eliminate the
violence which is there. I think the hon member raised a very, very
important point in this regard.

With regard to the road safety issue which the hon member and a number of
other members have raised, the Arrive Alive campaign is very important. It
draws attention to a number of specific and concrete things that we are
asking people to do over the holiday period. These are: Do not speed; do
not overload; do not drink and drive; wear your seat belts; ensure driver
and vehicle fitness - a very important element - and promote pedestrian
safety. Those are the six road safety commandments which we have indicated,
and I thought I should take the opportunity to stress their importance
since a number of hon members have raised the matter.

However, there is an additional point which I want to make. The Arrive
Alive campaign, important as it is, has limited objectives. It is not a
substitute for a national road safety programme for our country. Our
country has never had a national road safety programme. In our department
we are currently developing a discussion document which will lead to the
adoption of a national road safety programme in our country. I will not go
into any details now as the discussion document will be made available, and
I have no doubt that this House would want to debate the document.

I envisage that that document will be debated in the country so much that
ultimately we will have a product which will be very different from the
discussion document itself. However, for the first time we will have a
national road safety programme for which all South Africans will be
working.

One of the important elements of our road safety programme is a more
focused road safety education programme and a more focused law-enforcement
programme. With regard to education, I have already met with the Minister
of Education and our two departments have worked together, and we have
developed curricula for schools which are being implemented in tandem with
Curriculum 2005. These are going to unfold as the curriculum unfolds in our
schools, so much so that one is going to see many more of these elements
coming through. I think the hon member raised very, very important points.

The hon Nel raised a number of points and concerns. I just want to point
out in that regard that we are dealing with a number of processes at the
same time. This Bill is one element of a total transformation process of
road transport. It is but one element, and there are a number of other
elements. The recapitalisation process must therefore be seen as part of
that total transformation process.

Training is a very important issue to which the hon member referred. There
is some provision in the Bill for that. Also, within the taxi
recapitalisation process, which is not before the House today, provision is
made for training, not only of drivers, but also of taxi operators, in
order to develop their management capacity, financial management and other
forms of administration. Therefore training is going to form a very
important part of that process.

Hon councillor Surty raised some very important points. I just want to tell
her and the House that we consider the participation of local government to
be absolutely important. I consider it to be so important that immediately
after the first Ministers' committee, Mincom, meeting, ie a meeting of the
Minister and the MECs, I will arrange for an invitation to be sent to Salga
so that it is represented at our Mincom meetings, thereby getting local
government directly represented on our Mincom meetings through the
participation of Salga. I want to thank Salga for its participation and the
constructive contribution it has made.

I just want to make a very few brief comments on the input made by the hon
Raju of the DP. Unfortunately, whilst he has indicated that he welcomes the
Bill, he has made a number of remarks which are really inappropriate with
regard to this Bill. For example, he says that one of his concerns about
the Bill is diesel. Now, the word ``diesel'' does not appear in the Bill at
all. [Laughter.] That has nothing to do with this Bill but relates to the
recapitalisation process. So that is a little reckless.

He also says that there is a bias in favour of road transport. I do not
know why he is saying this, because there is no bias expressed in the Bill.
He did refer to the horse and carriage. Perhaps his party should go back to
the horse and carriage mode of transport. [Laughter.] However, I welcome
his positive remarks with regard to the Bill.

There is no overcentralisation, which is what the hon Raju was trying to
say. There is no centralisation. In fact, decentralisation is taking place.
The establishment of transport authorities at local level makes it possible
for local communities throughout our country to participate. He also made
the point that we are taking control away from taxi operators.

I take it my time is about to expire, and I must therefore conclude.

What the hon Raju is asking for is the retention of the current situation.
He is saying that we are taking control away from taxi operators, and he is
quite right - we are not allowing the industry to regulate itself. Because
we have had this form of deregulation for so many years with dire
consequences for our country, we think it is the duty of Government -
national, provincial and local - to regulate. However, we want to work in
partnership with the taxi industry, so that there is effective regulation
in the interests of commuters, the industry itself and the country as a
whole.

This notion, that when one asks politicians to take responsibility one is
doing something bad, is something I do not accept. Transport authorities
will be served by local politicians. They must accept responsibility - that
is what is happening here. Responsibility is placed upon their shoulders,
but they will have to work within the framework of the law.

Hon Chair, I can see you are getting extremely restless because my time has
expired.

There are a number of other matters which have been raised, and I will
respond to the House at another time. Perhaps we will have another occasion
to address them when we discuss recapitalisation in order to deal with the
many other matters which have been raised.

Finally, I want to thank hon Durr for the points which he has made. The
problem with the issue that we are dealing with is that once this Bill
becomes law, it will be applicable throughout the country. In fact, many of
these functions, such as the issuing of permits, already do occur in the
provinces. Many of the local authorities already perform various functions.
Therefore one cannot introduce them in a piecemeal way.

What we are doing - and I think the hon member is quite right in this
regard - is that we will be introducing the adjudication of traffic
offences law on an area-by-area basis, because that law lends itself to
that kind of pilot implementation, if I may put it that way. This means
learning from what we are doing and then improving our performance at other
levels. I think there are aspects of our programme which can be implemented
on an area-by-area basis, and then they can be extended to the rest of the
country.

However, one cannot do that with this particular Bill. The member is quite
right when he says this is an ambitious programme, but I believe it is not
overambitious. I think it is implementable, and we are unanimous as
national and provincial government and Salga that we can do it. I believe
that if we work together this will be a success, and that it will be one of
the country's success stories of this decade. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Before moving on, I

                    FIRE BRIGADE SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairperson, we support the Fire Brigade Services
Amendment Bill. In expressing our support, we would like to just briefly
raise a problem that the new board, as it is to be constituted, will have
to deal with.

The problem is that the SA Insurance Association and the fire protection
associations of South Africa have done an extensive survey recently which
shows that, in the past few years since 1993, the value of claims paid by
insurance companies for fires has quadrupled.

We see that the problem - this is a problem the board will have to deal
with - has been the response from fire brigades. When fire calls came in,
56% of fire stations did not have enough staff on duty and 44% did not
respond in the time set down in the code of practice approved by the SABS.
The consequence of that is that not only have claims quadrupled, but
premiums have also almost quadrupled. We see in the report of the fire
protection association that fire stations were understaffed and that these
people were demoralised.

There is an urgent necessity for us to take hold of this situation. I do
not want to be a scaremonger, but I want to say to the House that I would
like to have an assurance from the Minister concerned that if a multistorey
building in a South African city were to catch fire during peak period, the
local fire brigade would be able to cope and protect the lives of the
citizens. That is the bottom line. There are serious doubts about whether
that is the situation in our country.

With those remarks, we in the Western Cape would like to support the Bill.

Prince B Z ZULU: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I rise on behalf of the ANC
to express unconditional support of the changes brought about by this Bill.

First of all, the current composition of the national Fire Brigade Board is
not representative in terms of the new local government dispensation. Apart
from this, most of the members who represented government departments and
other institutions have either passed away or retired, and new appointees
have no knowledge of the function of the board. Although most of the
provisions of the Fire Brigade Services Act, Act 99 of 1987, were assigned
to the provinces by Proclamation No 153 of 31 October 1994, most of the
sections of the Act provide that approval be granted after consultation
with the board. Due to the fact that there are now nine provinces, this
implies that the board will have to convene more frequently to discuss some
of the urgent matters identified by the provinces and that provinces should
be properly represented on the board.

Clause 2 of the Bill seeks to amend section 2 of the Act by providing for a
newly constituted board which is reflective of the interests of local
government and the provinces. In giving recognition to gender equality, it
is deemed appropriate to include injunctions that the board must comprise
both women and men. The board shall, under subsection 2, be constituted as
follows: one person designated by the Minister, who shall be the
chairperson; one person designated by each of the premiers; two persons
designated by the SA Local Government Association; one person designated by
the Minister of Finance; and not more than three persons designated by the
Minister, one of whom represents organised business and one of whom
represents organised labour. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                         COMPETITION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance with section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:08.
