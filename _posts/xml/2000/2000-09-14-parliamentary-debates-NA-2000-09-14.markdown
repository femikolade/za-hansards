                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms N G W BOTHA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, despite the outcries of Patricia de Lille and Pagad that
       Ministers Maduna and Tshwete are accusing Pagad of the urban terror
       attacks without having any proof, media reports have substantiated
       the statements of the Ministers as the police have in their
       possession a report by an ex-Pagad member confessing to the
       involvement of Pagad in the urban terror attacks;


  (2) calls upon the hon Patricia de Lille to put the interests of the
       safety and security of the entire populace and the community of Cape
       Town first and desist from appeasing mischievous sectoral interests;
       and


  (3) commends the police for their commitment to end the spate of
       bombings.

[Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Independent Electoral Commission will open its 15 020
       voting stations on the weekend of 16 and 17 September 2000 to
       register voters for the municipal elections;


  (2) encourages all eligible voters to use this opportunity to check their
       details, if they have already registered, and if they have not yet
       registered, to do so on these days so that they will have the
       opportunity to vote for the party that will put all the people first
       ...
  [Interjections.]


  (3) calls on all South Africans to stand up and be counted by making
       their voices heard in the upcoming municipal elections, and, in so
       doing, prove that the recent acts of terrorism will not force any law-
       abiding South African citizens to suppress their voices.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the United Nations General Assembly has declared 16 September as
           the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer;
           and


       (b)  South Africa, as one of the signatories of the Montreal
           Protocol, is required to uphold the principles of the
           Convention; and


  (2) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  monitor the production, supply and use of ozone-depleting
           substances;


       (b)  provide Parliament and the country with annual reports of the
           success being achieved as a result of the measures being
           implemented by the signatories; and


       (c)  provide Parliament with a list of those countries defying the
           provisions of the Montreal Protocol.

day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

  (1) notes that Zithulele Combi, the first black dealer to be awarded an
       exchange licence by the South African Reserve Bank, has been named
       South Africa's best entrepreneur for the year 2000;


  (2) believes that our democratic dispensation has given opportunities for
       black entrepreneurs to display their skills and talent and reach
       their goals; and


  (3) congratulates Mr Zithulele Combi on his achievements.

[Applause.]

Mnr F BEUKMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -
  (1) met ernstige kommer kennis neem van die ontwrigting van 'n
       Demokratiese Alliansie-vergadering op Maandag, 11 September 2000, in
       die Macassar-woongebied, Helderberg, deur 'n groepie ontwrigters, van
       wie sommige T-hemde van die ANC aangehad het;


  (2) met kommer waarneem dat dié optrede grens aan die gedrag van die ANC
       se ideologiese bondgenoot, ZANU-PF, voor en tydens die algemene
       verkiesing in Zimbabwe ...

[Tussenwerpsels.]


  (3) 'n beroep doen op president Thabo Mbeki om toe te sien dat alle
       strukture en ondersteuners van die ANC die reg van vrye politieke
       optrede en die reg van politieke partye om vergaderings sonder
       ontwrigting te hou, respekteer;


  (4) enige pogings tot die ontwrigting en benadeling van individue en
       politieke partye se reg tot deelname aan die politieke proses en
       verkiesings ten sterkste veroordeel; en


  (5) versoek dat alle politieke partye wat aan die komende munisipale
       verkiesing gaan deelneem hulle tot die nakoming van artikels 16, 17,
       18 en 19 van die Grondwet verbind, en aktief hulle ondersteuners
       daartoe inbind.

[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with serious concern the disruption of a Democratic Alliance
       meeting on Monday, 11 September 2000, in the Macassar residential
       area, Helderberg, by a group of disruptors, some of whom were wearing
       ANC T-shirts;


  (2) notes with concern that this conduct borders on the behaviour of the
       ANC's ideological ally, ZANU-PF, before and during the general
       election in Zimbabwe ...
[Interjections.]


  (3) appeals to President Thabo Mbeki to ensure that all structures and
       supporters of the ANC respect the right of free political action and
       the right of political parties to hold meetings without disruptions;


  (4) condemns in the strongest possible terms the disruption and prejudice
       of the right of individuals and political parties to participate in
       the political process and elections; and


  (5) requests that all political parties that are going to be taking part
       in the coming municipal elections commit themselves to complying with
       sections 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Constitution, and actively hold
       their supporters to that.

[Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Chief N Z MTIRARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) after numerous appeals by the UDM urging the Government, and, in
       particular, the Municipal Demarcation Board, to consult traditional
       leaders on the determination of electoral boundaries in their areas
       of jurisdiction, the Chairman of the Board, Mr Sutcliffe, has
       eventually relented and consulted the House of Traditional Leaders in
       Bisho on the matter;


  (2) this consultation is of no consequence any longer, having come too
       late when the demarcations have already been done; and


  (3) the recalcitrance on the part of the Government and its designated
       structures, the Municipal Demarcation Board, reflects their
       reluctance to be transparent and sensitive to public sentiment.

Ms M VERWOERD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that Martina Reuter, a foreign graduate student, was forced to
       move out of shared accommodation after being told that her black
       friends were not welcome in the house;


  (2) believes that such incidents of racism cause deep offence to the
       majority of South Africans and deepen the historical divides that so
       many of us have fought so long to breach;


  (3) urges the Human Rights Commission to investigate this matter with the
       utmost urgency; and


  (4) assures Ms Reuter that -


       (a)  this House is committed to her right to freedom of association;
           and


       (b)  that such prejudices are not those of the majority of South
           Africans.

[Applause.]
Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with horror the actions of the four young men who viciously
       killed two innocent young people and attempted to kill a third just
       to steal their car;


  (2) notes that these killers were found guilty and sentenced to 35 years
       in prison, making them eligible for parole after 25 years;


  (3) acknowledges that it costs about R80,00 per day to keep one person in
       jail, and that R80,00 per day for four people for 25 years with only
       10% inflation amounts to over R11 million; and


  (4) calls on the Government to stop punishing law-abiding taxpayers and
       fulfil its biblical mandate to punish murders correctly by
       reinstating the death penalty.

[Interjections.]
The SPEAKER: Order!

Genl C L VILJOEN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem dat -


       (a)  24 September 2000 Erfenisdag is en dat hierdie dag die afgelope
           vier jaar gebruik is om 'n konferensie oor die regte en belange
           van kultuur-, taal- en godsdiensgemeenskappe in Suid-Afrika te
           hou; en


       (b)  die bepalings van artikel 185 van die Grondwet, wat moet uitloop
           op 'n Kommissie vir die regte van gemeenskappe in Suid-Afrika,
           ook telkens by hierdie konferensies 'n hoë prioriteit geniet
           het;


  (2) sy ernstige kommer uitspreek oor die feit dat daar vanjaar nie alleen
       geen sodanige konferensie gehou word nie, maar dat die voorgeskrewe
       wetgewing hieroor weer eens vir later jare uitgestel word;


  (3) in die lig van die ANC-regering se gebrek aan erns oor hierdie saak
       die Regering derhalwe versoek om aan die saak die prioriteit te
       verleen wat dit verdien; en


  (4) erken dat nasionale taalwetgewing 'n dringende behoefte is met 'n
       baie hoë prioriteit om uitvoering te gee aan artikel 6 van die
       Handves van Regte.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Gen C L VILJOEN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  24 September 2000 is Heritage Day and that for the past four
           years this day has been used to hold a conference on the rights
           and interests of cultural, linguistic and religious communities
           in South Africa; and


       (b)  the provisions of section 185 of the Constitution, which should
           result in a commission for the rights of communities in South
           Africa, have time and again received high priority at these
           conferences;


  (2) expresses its serious concern not only at the fact that such a
       conference will not be held this year, but that the prescribed
       legislation in this regard is once again being postponed for later
       years;


  (3) in view of the ANC Government's lack of seriousness regarding this
       issue, therefore requests the Government to grant the issue the
       priority it deserves; and


  (4) concedes that national legislation pertaining to languages is a
       pressing need with a very high priority in order to implement section
       6 of the Bill of Rights.]

Ms H M MPAKA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Black Economic Empowerment Commission yesterday
       outlined a comprehensive set of proposals for a national strategy on
       black economic empowerment to three parliamentary committees;


  (2) congratulates the Black Economic Empowerment Commission on having
       produced an impressive report; and


  (3) expresses the hope that the Government and Parliament will further
       engage the commission with the aim of refining and improving its
       proposals to accelerate empowerment.
[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the recently released annual report of the South African
       Reserve Bank shows a meagre growth rate of 1% in the first quarter of
       2000 and 1,5% in the second quarter;


  (2) expresses its concern that this low rate falls far short of the
       projected growth rates announced by the Minister of Finance in his
       Budget Speech, and that the economy will have to stage a remarkable
       turnaround in the 3rd and 4th quarters if we are to reach the targets
       laid down by the Minister;


  (3) further notes that this feeble performance contrasts starkly with
       growth rates this year in other emerging markets and a projected
       world growth rate of over 4%; and


  (4) calls on the Government to take all the necessary steps to attract
       foreign direct investment as a priority, and to ensure an economic
       turnaround in South Africa to ensure that we link ourselves to the
       dynamic cycle of growth in the world economy and in the other
       emerging markets generally.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear! [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  it is common cause that the magistrate's courts of our land are
           underresourced, overburdened and generally unable to mete out
           rapid justice; and


       (b)  the executive director of the Association of Law Societies of
           South Africa has offered the services of some of its 13 000
           members, free of charge, to the state to help out as relief
           magistrates, relief prosecutors and so on;


  (2) is perturbed that the Ministry and the Department of Justice have not
       seized this generous offer with alacrity and gratitude; and


  (3) calls on the Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development to
       meet urgently with the executive director, Mr Van Vuuren, to take the
       matter further and to achieve the modalities that are necessary to
       bring instant relief to the justice system.

Miss M N BUTHELEZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Job Creation Trust Fund has collected R62 million for
       the purpose of creating jobs, which will soon start providing
       employment;


  (2) recalls that all ANC members of Parliament alone, out of all the
       parties, contributed to this fund;


  (3) commends Cosatu, Nactu and Fedusa, their organisers and members -
       many from the lowest end of the salary scale - for organising and
       contributing to this initiative; and


  (4) calls on other civil institutions to follow the lead of the trade
       unions in contributing positively to resolving the challenges that
       face our economic transformation and development.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) welcomes the apology by Radio 702 talk show host, John Robbie, for
       his rudeness towards the Minister of Health;


  (2) acknowledges a growing rift within the ANC regarding the cause of
       Aids, and welcomes a document written by leaders of the ANC's
       national health committee which has called on the President and the
       Minister of Health to publicly acknowledge that HIV is the cause of
       Aids;
  (3) further welcomes the admission by Dr Essop Pahad that President
       Mbeki's standpoint on the cause of Aids should have been communicated
       and handled in a much more effective manner; and


  (4) challenges the Minister of Health, in the light of this, to take up
       John Robbie's offer to be interviewed by him once again and, this
       time, clearly identify her standpoint on the cause of Aids to the
       people of South Africa, who deserve a truthful and unambiguous
       answer.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


   (1)      welcomes the latest Corruption Index released yesterday by
        Transparency International as a valuable tool for measuring the
        fight against corruption on an annual basis;
   (2)      calls on the South African Government to develop a similar index
        for our country specifically, as a necessity in the fight against
        corruption;


   (3)      notes that South Africa still ranks 34th out of 90 countries;


   (4)      acknowledges that we have not succeeded in improving our record
        in the past year; and


   (5)      commits itself, once more, to the fight against corruption
        without fear or favour, as the watchdog of society over Government.

Mr M R BALOYI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


   (1)      notes the decision by the South African Rugby Football Union to
        impose massive fines on both the Lions and the Blue Bulls for
        overstepping the quota regulations in Currie Cup matches during the
        past month;


   (2)      further notes that the Blue Bulls wing, Rayno Hendricks, denied
        being injured in the game against Border in East London when he was
        replaced by a white player; and


   (3)      welcomes Sarfu's disciplinary steps and hopes that this will
        eradicate racist attitudes and practices in rugby.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SA PARLIAMENTARY OBSERVER MISSION TO ZIMBABWE

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker and hon members, Dr
Manie Schoeman, who is on the gallery, was one of the members of the
delegation sent by this Parliament to Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]
[Applause.] On 17 May 2000, this House resolved to send an observer mission
to Zimbabwe to observe the general elections of that country and to report
to Parliament.

In carrying out this important mandate, the mission observed the elections
and did not make any interventions into the electoral processes, nor
interfere with the internal political dynamics and debates in Zimbabwe. In
pursuing this mandate, the mission was open-minded, took a balanced
approach and did not reach any conclusions until it had met all the
relevant role-players.

What was also important about this delegation was that it was composed of
various political parties representing diverse constituencies. Yet it acted
as a united delegation representing Parliament and the people of South
Africa. The resolve to co-operate and discuss political differences amongst
ourselves and reach consensus enabled this delegation to present to this
House today a consensus report that reflects what we saw, what we were told
and what we experienced.

The recent elections in Zimbabwe were a product of a unique historical
evolution and should, thus, be understood within this historical context.
Zimbabwe, formerly known as Rhodesia, was a British colony from the late
1800s to 1965. From 1965 to 1980 it was under the regime of Ian Smith. The
people of Zimbabwe, under the leadership of Zapu and Zanu, waged heroic
struggles against British colonialism and the regime of Ian Smith.
[Interjections.]

The people of Zimbabwe were liberated from colonial rule following the
Lancaster House agreement and voted for a new democratic government in
1980. It is a matter of record that there has been more than one general
election in Zimbabwe after the 1980 independence. It is also a matter of
record that in the early 1980s, there was a violent and bloody conflict in
Matebeleland. Yet the June elections and the pre-election violence have
stirred a lot of controversy in Zimbabwe, in the region and on the
continent. It seems that the rejection of the proposed new constitution, in
the referendum, was one of the most important aspects that formed the
political context within which the elections were held.

The parliamentary delegation left home soil on 7 June 2000 to observe the
period leading up to the general elections and the two days of elections.
During our stay in Zimbabwe we received briefings from a wide range of
political parties, media organisations, organisations from civil society
and the SA High Commission. These briefings enabled the commission to
develop an overall picture of the Zimbabwean situation.

The South African parliamentary delegation met and co-operated with
observer missions from the region, from our continent and from the wider
international community. Although we co-operated with these missions, we
carried out our tasks independently and objectively, and we present to this
House a report which was not influenced by any mission except ourselves.

The delegation further divided itself into six teams and visited some of
the key provinces. Their mandate was to meet with the political parties,
government departments, police, provincial registrars responsible for
elections, and civil society to get briefings on the situation at local
level. The mission had to observe the progress of the campaign, especially
with regard to the prevalence of violence and intimidation. The mission
visited the following provinces, namely Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West,
Masvingo, Manicaland, Midlands and Matebeleland.

In the provinces we observed the logistic preparations for voting and the
counting of ballot papers. We also familiarised ourselves with the location
of counting stations. In our interaction with the role-players and
stakeholders in the provinces, a number of complaints were raised with us.
Many opposition parties were complaining about the manner in which
constituencies were demarcated and alleged that the demarcation commission
had displayed a bias towards rural constituencies which were perceived to
be Zanu-PF strongholds. There was a problem with regard to the manner in
which soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo were to cast their
votes.

The mission further received reports from the election supervisory
commission and opposition parties that this commission had been stripped of
real power and capacity to fulfil its constitutional obligations. Reference
was made to the fact that the Registrar General had taken over the function
of accrediting domestic monitors. Other complaints included the role of the
public broadcaster, the Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation, and the
Zimbabwean police, which were alleged to have been biased against
opposition parties. A major problem raised was the violence and
intimidation, particularly in the rural areas, in the period leading up to
the elections.

The mission received many reports of violence and intimidation, both during
briefings in Harare and during briefings on its visits to the provinces.
Some of this violence appeared to be systematic, planned and aimed at
intimidating supporters of other parties and creating no-go areas. In other
instances the violence appeared to be more a spontaneous result of the
heightened political tension in the country. There were numerous
allegations of intimidation in rural areas against farm workers in the form
of the so-called ``re-education sessions''. Many parties and organisations
reported that the violence and intimidation emanated mainly from the ranks
of Zanu-PF. The mission observed that no single party, however, seemed to
have the monopoly on the use of violence.

Despite these problems, the elections were characterised by peace and calm
and by a large turn-out on the two days of general elections. Voting was
conducted efficiently and the counting process was characterised by a
meticulous and transparent process of reconciling votes cast and ballot
papers used. These were carefully scrutinised by polling agents, observers
and monitors. The voting and counting processes on 24, 25 and 26 June 2000
proceeded very peacefully. All the contesting parties indicated that they
would accept the outcome of the general elections.

The mission is of the opinion that despite incidents of violence and
intimidation in the run-up to the elections, the results of parliamentary
elections in Zimbabwe reflected the will of the people of that country.
Having gone to Zimbabwe, the delegation has gained experience in the
monitoring of elections. We learned lessons which were good and which could
be adopted for our own conditions. There were also lessons which were bad
and which we should avoid at all costs.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the South African parliamentary
delegation. This delegation truly upheld the best traditions of our
Parliament. It represented Parliament and carried and its responsibilities
to the best of its ability. I firmly believe that the presence of this and
many other delegations in Zimbabwe contributed to the lowering of tensions
and intimidation during the two days of the general elections in that
country. This delegation deserves a round of applause for a mission
accomplished. [Applause.] I think this mission deserves a round of applause
from the opposition benches, too. [Applause.]

A word of thanks to the South African High Commission in Zimbabwe for co-
ordinating our programme and for ensuring that we met all the important
role-players and stakeholders in Zimbabwe. Our mission would have been
impossible without their unqualified support.

Lastly, a word of thanks to the people of Zimbabwe for the manner in which
they conducted themselves during the two-day elections. We hope that the
people of Zimbabwe will use the post-election period to deepen their
democratic processes and solve their problems amicably in the interest of
all Zimbabweans. [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, the collective sigh of relief from
within Zimbabwe and the neighbouring states that the election did not end
in total chaos and bloodshed cannot erase the impressions of a tyrant who
abused democratic rules for self-serving objectives. A well-known
journalist, Thami Mazwai, said:

  Mugabe's hands are dripping with the blood of political opponents and
  other Zimbabweans who have been murdered.

President Mugabe realised, in the months leading up to the elections, that
nondelivery was likely to be the focus of the campaign. His reaction was to
play the race card in order to divert attention away from his own failures.
This ploy was only partially successful, and the Movement for Democratic
Change managed to mount a truly multiracial campaign in response.

With the benefit of hindsight, there are a number of lessons that can be
learnt from the Zimbabwean elections. I am not in the habit of quoting my
colleague Jeremy Cronin, but he stated that the comparison between South
Africa and Zimbabwe is irresistible. His analysis was that it is a case of
... ``a ruling party with heroic liberation credentials. But it has
alienated the urban masses, intellectuals, workers and professionals.''
Zimbabwe has shown that, if political parties of this kind have to account
for their record of nondelivery, the race card becomes very attractive.

Zimbabwe was a test close to home of our Government's commitment to the
vision of an African renaissance. The ANC Government, in order to protect
old friends, sacrificed its own integrity with regard to our commitment to
the African renaissance, as well as what is right and what is wrong. Kaizer
Nyatzumba argued:


  Turning a blind eye to violations of human rights, because those
  violations happen to be perpetrated by one's friends, is hardly a noble
  quality.

As was the case with the Aids conference, it required our former President,
Mr Mandela, to be the nation's and the ANC's conscience when he said that
the public itself must bring down these tyrants. Silent diplomacy was the
wrong approach, because it sent out the message that our commitment to the
African renaissance will always be subject to the political friendships of
the party in government. Policies of quiet diplomacy have their place in
politics, but the limit of quiet diplomacy is the point at which innocent
lives are sacrificed. That test was failed.

The arrogance of power was clearly illustrated by the statement of Zanu-PF
vice-president, Simon Muzenda, as quoted in the state-owned daily, the
Herald:


  Even if we put a baboon in Chivu, if you are Zanu-PF, you vote for that
  baboon. Whoever we put, you vote for him. When President Mugabe is not
  there, I run the country. If I sign your death warrant, you will hang.

Although it can be said theoretically that the result on the election day
reflects the will of the people, that will was distorted by pre-election
intimidation and manipulation. The International Republican Institute said
that, of the 90 elections the institute had observed in 40 countries since
1984 ``Zimbabwe's is the worst we have ever seen''.
Our participants in the parliamentary delegation - with the exception of
one - reported back that the mission was well-led by the ANC Chief Whip, Mr
Yengeni, and that his conduct and the handling of the mission was beyond
reproach. There was one exception, and that was the visit to President
Mugabe to which non-ANC members of the mission and of Parliament were not
invited. The fact that this meeting took place in addition to the official
ANC delegation's presence in Harare was inappropriate. It conveyed the
impression that he spoke on behalf of all political parties represented in
the mission, and that the meeting was in his capacity as leader of the
mission, which was not the case.

This Parliament needs a formal and binding protocol which is more
comprehensive than a code of conduct to guide the behaviour of future
participants in such missions, especially where they are the leaders of
delegations, and are supposed to act on behalf of everyone, and not on
behalf of partisan interests.

In conclusion, Zimbabwe can either be a preview of what may happen in South
Africa over the next few years, or it can be a warning - Mr Cronin has
argued that case very convincingly. In South Africa over the next few years
... [Interjections.] Well, there are about a third of the MPs on this side
who agree with this viewpoint, and who agree with Mr Cronin. This may
happen in South Africa over the next few years, or it can be a warning
signal alerting us to the danger of the arrogance of power.

Zimbabwe must also serve as a reminder of how dangerous the racialising of
politics in societies such as ours is. But, above all, Zimbabwe is a
reminder that race cards are not trump cards. It can only divert attention
away from nondelivery for so long before the Government is called to
account for its failures. [Applause.]

Ms N N MAPISA-NQAKULA: Madam Speaker, hon members, on 23 June 2000
thousands of people across the length and breath of Zimbabwe went to the
polls to vote in an election which the prophets of doom had predicted would
either not happen or would not be free and fair.

I want to present to the House our own experience of that election,
especially with regard to the question of violence. Comments by experts and
others in the run-up to the election were so negative that it would not
have been out of place to have expected to be confronted by scenes of a
country on the verge of collapse. So negative was the assessment of that
situation that it conjured up in one's mind scenes of mad people carrying
guns and other weapons of war, running amok in the streets of the country's
major cities and the countryside.

But the truth was that people were clearly not under siege. They went about
conducting their normal daily business freely, without any signs of fear or
intimidation. That, at least, was the picture we saw on our arrival in
Zimbabwe. However, when we started to interface with the representatives of
various NGOs, churches, trade unions, political parties and members of that
country's academia, a different picture, which was disturbing, emerged. We
received reports of many instances of violent attacks on potential voters.
This, we were told, had started immediately after the referendum on
Zimbabwe's new constitution in which the ruling PF party was defeated.
Veterans of the liberation struggle, who had initiated farm invasions,
apparently escalated that programme and, in the process, introduced
violence that also affected farmworkers.

The farmworkers, we were told, were forced to attend what was referred to
as re-education classes right through the night. It would seem that they
were subjected to propaganda lessons on the history of Zimbabwe, the
liberation struggle and the need to support the ruling party in the coming
elections. It was also reported that supporters of the opposition were
attacked by supporters of the ruling party, and their property destroyed.
It was alleged that government displayed complacency in dealing with the
matter and in some respects even colluded with the attackers.

It would seem that, following media reports on the situation and
international condemnation, the attacks decreased. More pressure was
applied on the perpetrators of the violence by the arrival of the
international observers, which further reduced the levels of violence. Our
delegation decided that one of the first things we had to do, given the
reports of violence we were getting, was to meet with the war veterans, as
they called themselves, who were reportedly spearheading the violence. The
purpose was to verify the allegations and to make it clear to them that we
were going to visit all areas of interest to us, including the farms.

During our meeting with them it emerged that the war veterans to a certain
extent had been involved in acts of intimidation and violence against the
farmworkers. Reports that the government was not doing anything about the
violence were not entirely true. There was a daily television programme on
the national broadcaster which was used by the police to give detailed
reports of acts of violence in different parts of the country. This
programme gave details of the number of attacks, perpetrators arrested,
their political affiliation and other details. It was interesting to note
that the perpetrators in the main were supporters of both the Movement for
Democratic Change and Zanu-PF.

On the eve of the election there were major political rallies of the two
main contending parties where further violence was reported. It was
striking to note that there was a very strong police presence at Zanu-PF
rallies, but at MDC rallies, in particular the one held in Harare, a small
police contingent was deployed. This, of course, allowed people to commit
acts of violence inside the stadium and in full view of the international
media without any fear of police intervention. Indeed, the police never
acted against the perpetrators.

On both the voting and counting days Zimbabwe remained calm and peaceful.
No incidents of violence were reported. This was our experience in
Zimbabwe. But this violence came from both sides in a cycle of attacks and
counterattacks.

Those South Africans who so often hide behind amnesia when the ugly face of
our past pops up should remember the period in South Africa leading up to
our own 1994 elections in this country. Surely, we cannot have forgotten
that part of our history so soon. Witnesses have appeared before the TRC to
recount their own participation in acts of violence in the run-up to our
1994 democratic elections and even leading up to the local government
elections.

Those from South Africa who have been calling for all manner of punitive
actions against Zimbabwe never called for similar actions against South
Africa, not even when it became clear that there was a third force with
connections to the apartheid regime which was sponsoring violence in our
country. In fact, one of the most brutal incidents of violence was the
assassination of that gallant fighter, Comrade Chris Hani, which forced the
racist regime to give South Africa a date for our first democratic
election.

Members will remember the massacre of the people of Boipatong. Nobody
demanded long before the elections in South Africa that our polls should be
declared nul and void because of the violence. Indeed our elections have
been declared free and fair since 1994.

When Zimbabweans went to the polls in that country's democratic election,
there were many instances of violent political attacks against potential
voters, but the elections happened and they were declared free and fair,
allowing the population of that country to elect a democratic government of
their own choice after many years of brutal colonialism. Nobody was
prevented from casting his or her vote. Those who wanted to participate in
the election did so and, importantly, voted for the party of their choice.

The people of Zimbabwe have spoken. As responsible members of the
international community, let us support our Government, led by the
President, in their efforts to assist Zimbabweans on their road to
political and economic recovery. [Applause.]

Mnu M A MZIZI: Somlomo nePhalamende elihloniphekile, mangithathe leli thuba
ngibonge kuwe Somlomo nePhalamende elihloniphekile ngokuthi nasinika ithuba
lokuyokwethamela udaba nokhetho lwaseZimbabwe.

Ngibonga kumfowethu oyilungu likaKhongolose, uTony Yengeni, owayehola lelo
thimba lamanxusa. Walihola ngobuhlakani nangobuqotho. Ngibonga nakozakwethu
esasihambisana nabo siya khona laphaya eZimbabwe nakuba sengidabuka nje
ngokuthi ngibabonga nje ozakwethu omunye wabo, owayeyilungu ngale kwi-New
NP, sengiyezwa makhathaleni useqembukile. [Uhleko.] Kodwa-ke kukhona
engikusolayo ngalokhu kuqembuka kwakhe ngoba ngike ngezwa nasemsakazweni
ekuseni nje kukhulunywa ngendaba yokuthi abehluleli empini ka-De Lange,
ayebhekene kuyo no-Manie Schoeman, behluleka ukwehlulela ukuthi ngubani
owehluliwe. [Uhleko.] Ngiyamsola naye uSoswebhu omKhulu ngoba phela
umfowethu lo, u-Manie, wayehamba naye eseqenjini lakhe. [Ihlombe.]
Ngamahlaya nje lawo. Engihlose ukukusho lapha, uma ngibonga kanjena,
ngukuthi sasiye kokwethamela udaba lwaseZimbabwe. Nanku-ke umbiko futhi
engethemba ukuthi bonke abantu bazowufunda uma bengaba nakho ukuthi
bawufunde. Okumqoka nakhu: Ngokwenkolo, kuye kuthiwe uma sebekhulumile
ofakazi ababili noma abathathu, basuke bekhuluma iqiniso. Kodwa
kwezombusazwe angikholwa ukuthi kuyasebenza lokho.
ILUNGU ELIHLONIPHEKILE: Cha, akusebenzi.

Mnu M A MZIZI: Akusebenzi. Mangikusho lokhu ukuthi umbiko esinawo lapha
ngumbiko ohlanganisiwe waba ngumbonomunye. Kodwa ngithanda ukuphawula-ke
kulokho engakubona ngamehlo enyama ngoba phela kukhona okunye
esingakufakanga lapha embikweni. Umbiko esinawo wawunemigomo esasinikezwe
yona yokuthi siyokwethamela laphaya, hhayi ukuthi siyoqapha. Sasingayile
koqapha.

Kwenzeka-ke izimo eziningi laphayana. Amalungu ayakhumbula ukuthi
kwakhulunywa kabanzi ngeZimbabwe singakafiki khona, kodwa-ke ubuhlakani
esabenza kwaba ngukubonana namaqembu angaphakathi ezweni asinikeza imibiko
eminingi. Engingathandi-ke ukuthi kulahleke lapho ngukuthi kwaba khona
abanye abantu impela abalethwa phambi kwethu okuthiwa bahlukunyezwa
ngalokhu nalokhuya.

Kokunye ukuhlukunyezwa kwabo, ngiyakhumbula sikhuluma nomame abasitshela
ukuthi izikole ezazilinganiselwa e-150 zavalwa. Kwabaleka othishela
kubonakala impela ukuthi impi yabe seyingenile, isisemnyango. Kuyezwakala
ukuthi amakhosikazi abo adlwengulwa, edlwengulwa phela yizo izigagayi lezo
zempi. Lobo bufakazi asizange sibe nalo iqiniso eliphelele ngabo, ngoba
phela umuntu ngeke akhuluma ngento ayizwe ngomunye umuntu. Kuye kufanele
into enjalo iqiniseke enkantolo. Ngababuza ukuthi ngabe amacala ayefakiwe
yini enkantolo na. Baphendula bathi umuntu wayengalifaka kubani icala
enkantolo ngoba amaphoyisa ayetsheliwe ukuthi zonke izinto eziphathelene
nombusazwe nombangazwe azingabikwa futhi ngeke zemukeleka. Akukho nokuthi
senzani lapho ngoba sabuka nje. Akukho cala esalizwa lokudlwengula nanoma
elani.

Ake ngingene kulolu daba lwezigagayi zempi. Empeleni, sabe sesihlangana
nazo izigagayi zempi. Kwakukhona umfo kaHundzvi engezwa kuthiwa nguyena
owayezihola phambili, eyikhala eliphambili. UHundzvi wakubeka ngembaba.
Sathi sisaqala ukubonana nje naye, esacela ukusibiza ngama-comrades,
ngathi: Cha, mfowethu, mina ungangibizi nge-comrade ngoba ngiyazi ukuthi
ama-comrades angenzani empilweni yami. [Uhleko.] Wavele wabhavuluka wathi:
UyiNkatha wena! Ngathi mina: Ehhe, usho khona impela. Kwangethusa-ke ngoba
wathi esuka wabe esethi: Uyabona wena, Nkatha, yini ningezanga eminyakeni
emine eyedlule lapha eZimbabwe? Ngathi kuye: Uyabona, ukuba wawusicele
eminyakeni engama-20 eyadlula, sasiyokuza, kodwa-ke sasingeke sigxambukele
ezindabeni zaseZimbabwe singamenyiwe.

Kwaqhutshekwa nenkulumo kwathi uma sesibuza ukuthi uma ngabe sesiya
ezindaweni zasemapulazini ngabe kukhona yini okwakuzophazamisa, njengoba
babethi singazihlanganisi nezindaba zamapulazi. Sasingayanga ukuyokhuluma
indaba yamapulazi laphaya, sasiyokwethamela inqubo yokhetho. Kwabonakala
ukuthi kwakubaphatha kabi ngempela lokho. Kwaze kwathi uma esebhekisa
ngakimi lo mfowethu onguzakwethu, uMpontshane - angazi-ke noma ngabe
wayenza ihlaya yini, - wathi: Uyabona, uma niya laphaya emapulazini,
niyohlangabezana nembibizane engaphezu kwalokho enanikwenza kuKhongolose
nibagwaza ngemikhonto. Ngathi kuye: Hhayi-bo, kahle. Uyaphaphalaza-ke manje
wena, awusakhulumi khona. Asizelanga lokho lapha. [Uhleko.]

Le ndaba yokufundiswa kabusha, yayingukuhlukumeza okungaphezulu
emphefumulweni nasenyameni yomuntu. Mina, uqobo lwami, ngikwazi kahle
lokho. Ngake ngathathwa kwathiwa mangiye kotoyitoyiza enkundleni
yezemidlalo ngoba kwakuthiwa mangiphume emkhandlwini. Ngangiphoqelekile
impela ukuthi amadolo lawa ngiwalinganise nesilevu. [Uhleko.]
Ngangigijinyiswa yizingane zingigcwalisa inkundla leyo. Ngahlukumezeka
ngoba kwakuyinto engangingayithandi. Baqeda lapho baya emzini wami bafika
bahlabelela ngendlela yokuthi kwakungadilika umthangala wendlu, bethi
mangingene emzabalazweni.

Mayelana nalokho kufundiswa kabusha, linye ipulazi esaya kulo. Uma sifika
kulelo pulazi kwathiwa, cha, lapho-ke abantu babehlabelela ubusuku bonke.
Kwakungukuhlukumezeka okungaphezulu lokho.

Akukhona okubi kuphela okwaba khona eZimbabwe. Kukhona okuhle esakucosha
lapho nengithanda ukuthi iNingizimu Afrika ikwamukele ngoba kuyinselele.
Amabhokisi abo okufaka amaphepha amavoti awafani nalawa ethu amancanyana.
Baphatha ubhazabhaza webhokisi lamavoti okuthi uma kuphonswa kulo
kungalokho kushintshwa. Nalabo ababeqaphe amabhokisi babeqapha ibhokisi
elilodwa, balale phezu kwalo bebeke izandla kulo. [Uhleko.] Awethu-ke
ayalahleka lapha ngoba maningi.

Ngale kwalokho, ubuchwepheshe babo bokwenza umsebenzi wokhetho babukhombisa
ukuba phezulu kakhulu kwezinga. Ngakuthanda lokho. Ngakuthanda nokukhankasa
kwabo. Lapha eZimbabwe, njengoba i-Zanu PF umgomo wayo wokukhankasa wawuthi
``Land is the economy,  economy is the land'', ngabona ukuthi i-Zanu PF
yalanda into eyayisezinhliziyweni zabantu. Yakhetha yona. Izigagayi
yazisebenzisa kulokho-ke ngoba zazihlala esangweni ziqaphile, ziqaphe
ukuthi kungabikho muntu weqembu eliphikisayo ozoya kokhankasa amapulazini.

Ngakho-ke kithina Ningizimu Afrika ngabe siyayibona yini ukuthi injani
indaba yomhlaba? Uma abantu bengaze bafike ekuthukutheleni, izoba yinkinga
nakithi njengoba iyinkinga eZimbabwe. Sasingayanga ngalokho. Asingenanga
kulolo daba ngoba sasesaba ukuthi uma umuntu ekhuluma ngezwe bazothi:
Emuva!  Njengoba nikhomba thina ngeminwe nje, le emithathu ekhomba nina
nithini ngayo? Ngakho-ke kuyinselele kithina nakuHulumeni wethu ukuthi
masikwazi ukulusheshisa nathi udaba lungaze lube yimbibizane, lube yinkinga
kithi sonke. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI: Madam Speaker and hon members, I would like to take this
opportunity to thank you, Madam Speaker, and the honourable House for
giving us a chance to observe the elections in Zimbabwe.

I would like to thank the hon Tony Yengeni, who is a member of the ANC and
who also led the team of representatives. He led it with intelligence and
honesty. I would also like to thank my colleagues who were members of the
team, especially the former member of the New NP who, I have recently been
told, has left his party. [Laughter.] I think there is something fishy
about his defection because I heard over the radio this morning that the
judges in the fight between De Lange and Mannie Schoeman failed to make a
ruling as to who the loser was. [Laughter.] I also blame the Chief Whip
because he was walking with the hon Schoeman as he was representing his
party. [Applause.]

Those are just jokes. What I want to say as I thankfully talk like this is
that we went to observe the situation in Zimbabwe. Here is another report
which I think people will need if they have a chance to read it. The
important thing is that, in a religious context, if two or three witnesses
have spoken, what they have told is taken as the truth. However, in
politics I am not sure if that is the case.

An HON MEMBER: No, it does not apply.

Mr M A MZIZI: It does not apply. I must say that the report that we have
here is the report that has been agreed to by all. However, I would like to
point out what I see because there are things that we did not include in
the report. The report that we had contained instructions concerning the
places in which we would observe the elections. We were not there as
monitors.

Many different things happened. Members will remember that a lot of talks
were given about Zimbabwe before we went there. The wise thing we did was
that we met with political parties in Zimbabwe and they gave us different
reports. What I want to mention is that there were people who were brought
to us. We were told they had been victimised in different ways.

According to the women we talked to, the victimisation they suffered
included the closure of about 150 schools. Teachers ran away since it was
thought that war was imminent. It was reported that women were raped by war
veterans. We did not get enough evidence to support those claims because
one cannot rely solely on what one has heard. Such claims should be proved
in a court of law. I asked them whether the cases had been reported to the
police. They asked to whom they could have reported the cases because the
police had been told not to record any politically related cases. They said
they did not do anything, they just watched the situation. There were no
cases of rape that we heard of.

Let me focus on the issue of war veterans. In fact we did meet with the war
veterans. There was Mr Hundzvi who, I was told, was the leader of the war
veterans. When he asked permission to call us comrades I said to him:
``Please, brother, do not call me comrade, because I know what comrades did
to me.'' [Laughter.] He exploded and said: ``You are an IFP member!'' I
said: ``Yes, you are absolutely correct.'' It surprised me because then he
said: ``Look, you in the IFP, why did you not come to Zimbabwe four years
ago?'' I said to him: ``Look, if you had asked us 20 years ago, we would
have come. However, we would not have interfered in the affairs of Zimbabwe
uninvited.''

A long discussion went on. When we asked whether it would be a problem if
we went to farms they said we should not get involved with the farm issues.
We did not go there to discuss farm issues. We were there to observe the
elections. It was clear that they were not comfortable with that. By that
time my colleague, the hon Mpontshane, pointed out to me that if we went to
the farms, we would encounter difficulties that would be more serious than
what we did to the ANC when we stabbed them with assegais. I do not know
whether he was joking. I said to him: ``No, stop. You are out of order now.
We are not here to discuss that.'' [Laughter.]

The issue of re-educating people involved terrible victimisation affecting
body and soul. I myself know that very well. I was once taken to a stadium
where I was told to toyi toyi as a means of forcing me to leave the IFP. I
was forced to fold my knees so much that they touch my chin. [Laughter.]
Children forced me to run all over the stadium. I was traumatised because I
was doing something I did not like. From there they went to my house and
sang loudly so that the stone wall supporting my house could fall. They
were forcing me to join their struggle.

Concerning the re-education of people, there was only one farm that we
visited. When we got there, we heard that people had been forced to sing
the whole night. That was a terrible abuse.

There was nothing bad that we found in Zimbabwe. There were good things we
found there which I want South Africa to take as a challenge. Their ballot
papers were not like ours, especially the little ones. They had a big box
and when they threw papers in it there was no need to change the boxes.
Even election monitors were monitoring only one box. They slept next to it
and laid their hands on it. [Laughter.] Our ballot papers get lost because
there are too many.

Besides that, their technology regarding the elections proved to be at a
higher level. I liked that. I liked the way they conducted their election
campaigns. As the policy of the Zanu-PF in Zimbabwe says: ``Land is the
economy, economy is the land''. I noticed that the Zanu-PF was campaigning
for something that was near to the heart of many people. It chose to
concentrate on it. It used war veterans as police since they were sitting
at the gate policing. They were there to ensure that no political
opposition was going to campaign on the farms.
The question is, here in South Africa, do we see how serious the land issue
is? If people reach a stage where they get angry, the land issue will be as
big a problem as it is in Zimbabwe today. That was not the reason why we
went there. We did not touch the land issue because we were afraid that if
we talked about land they would say: Go back! As you point a finger at us,
what about the three fingers that are pointing at you?'' Therefore, this is
a challenge to us and to our Government that we should quickly resolve this
issue before it becomes a problem to all of us. [Applause.]]

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I am sorry to bother
you. It was really impossible to listen to the previous speaker as there is
a problem with these systems. The problem is that one not only hears the
interpretation but also the speaker himself on the same channel, which
really makes it impossible to follow the debate. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! I have previously alerted the Table that ever since the
switches have been in operation matters have become very difficult. It may
improve the microphones, but it does not work for the hearing devices, and
I understand that this problem is being addressed. I am afraid that until
the problem is resolved, we will have to do the best we can. I would like
to suggest to those controlling the sound at the moment that, when there is
interpreting to which a large number of members are listening, they tone
down the sound from the microphones at the podium. I hope that improves
matters.
Mr G B D McINTOSH: Madam Speaker, I think that you will have appreciated,
from colleagues Mzizi and Yengeni's speeches, that when Dr Hundzvi told us
that we would not be welcome to visit the farms, both Mr Yengeni and Mr
Mzizi did not like that idea at all and were quite determined to visit
them.

I would like, on behalf of myself and my party, to thank you and this
Parliament for mandating us to go to Zimbabwe. This Parliament has great
authority and status when it expresses itself as a Parliament rather than
as members of a party represented in Parliament. We can indeed be proud of
our Parliament, particularly when we put South Africa's interests first for
that Parliament. I believe that we did that in a responsible way, and Mr
Yengeni was our leader.

Our presence in Zimbabwe was significant, unique and important. The
significance was because of our democratic and nonracial Parliament.
Ordinary Zimbabweans admire and respect our democracy and economic
prosperity. We were unique because no other observer group consisted only
of members of Parliament. We were important because Zimbabwe is umbilically
linked to South Africa. The Matebele and the whites migrated into that
country, and still play a key role.

South Africa and Zimbabwe are powerfully linked in economic terms. We trade
with them. They owe us hundreds of millions of rands. We can buy vegetables
from Zimbabwe at Woolworths in Cape Town. It is estimated that as many as
one million Zimbabweans work in South Africa. Many have studies and still
are studying at our institutions. It is a small country with only 11
million people and 98% of them are black Africans. Its national budget is
similar in size to that of the City of Johannesburg. They recognise that we
are a very powerful nation when compared to themselves.

The second thing which I learnt was that voters who read, talk and are
educated do not vote for racist agendas. Zimbabweans, and particularly the
``born-frees,'' are well-educated. They have never had Bantu education. The
people value law and order, efficiency and progress.

President Mugabe's campaign was openly racist in chanting ``Pasi amaBunu''
[``Down with the boers''] and tribal in talking of indigenisation, which is
a codeword for promoting the interests of the Shona clans. President Mugabe
spoke at two Mass or Star rallies at which I was present and, on both
occasions, he was four hours late. His utterances were anti-white, anti-
British and he promoted the lawless and violent invasion of commercial
farms to intimidate workers and farmers.

Today, in Business Day, Dr Edison Zvobgo, one of his former Ministers, a
Zanu-PF member and a member of Parliament, summed it up when he said that
the land invasions had tainted what was a glorious revolution, reducing it
to some agrarian racist enterprise. Voters, whether black or white, do not
keep their brains nor their money in their skins. The voters of Zimbabwe
wanted delivery and economic development. They are no different from voters
around the world. That is a lesson we should all learn for South African
politics. [Interjections.]

Allied to this was the commitment of the people of Zimbabwe to vote. I
think the real message is that free and fair in Africa is complicated - my
colleague, Mrs Mapisa-Nqakula, I think over-simplified the issue ...
[Interjections.] The point is that we need to recognise the fact that the
people of Zimbabwe have struck a blow for democracy in Southern Africa.
From nowhere, a party that had existed for nine months was able to mobilise
50% of the voters to support it.

Mr Mugabe's activities have done severe damage to South Africa and our
region. He has been like a child playing with matches, with all our
futures. Almost single-handedly, he is making a joke of the African
renaissance. Our President should tell him that. In the late 1950s the
President, at least the then Prime Minister of South Africa, had to tell Mr
Ian Smith that he had to settle and organise himself. It is time we did the
same to President Mugabe.

I believe that this delegation has served the cause of democracy well, and
I hope that members will read this report when it comes out. I am
disappointed that they do not have it on their desks already. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I will draw your attention to the fact that the
report has been published in the parliamentary papers, and I hope members
have actually read it before the debate.

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, hon members, I would like to start off by
thanking the hon Yengeni for his report and the hon Mapisa-Nqakula for her
remarks. These are important to our party, for two reasons. The first
reason is that the hon Yengeni recognises the important negative role
played by tensions and violence in Zimbabwe in the elections. The hon
Mapisa-Nqakula's remarks about the unequal distribution of police at voting
stations is also very important. These two remarks, I think, will go a long
way towards helping Southern African countries to plan an effective
mechanism for organising free and fair elections.

I would like to say to the hon Mr McIntosh that the significance of this
particular group in observing those elections was not because of the white
farmers and the land invasions. It was not because of his particular
party's interest in those elections. It was important for South Africans
historically, because we were paying tribute to the very important role
that the frontline states in Africa and the people of Zimbabwe played in
the brutal passage of our own quest for independence in this country.
[Applause.] I do not expect him to fully understand and appreciate that. We
have a long way to go.

I would also like to state that the UDM warned that in the run-up to the
elections, intimidation was to be considered as a possible major problem,
that elections would have to be free and fair, and that elections would
have to be accepted by all. We know that before the elections took place,
international observers asserted that intimidation was very high.
Subjective and partisan statements made by some observers from South Africa
on the situation in Zimbabwe were unhelpful and only served to exacerbate
the situation.

The situation in Zimbabwe is instructive in our country, because here, too,
the pre-election atmosphere was charged with high levels of political
intolerance and intimidation, often without exception, resulting in the
killing of political opponents. Of course, the political intolerance
preceding the elections in Zimbabwe differed from the South African
scenario, because in Zimbabwe we had overt official backing, sanction and
orchestration of violence, whereas in South Africa we had an insidious
covert phenomenon which, nevertheless, left one with no doubt that
political parties which had come to be known as common denominators in the
political violence in this country, were implicate.

We cannot be smug, therefore, about our own electoral experience while
pontificating about the Zimbabwean scenario. It is a historical fact that
African political systems are at their weakest or collapse during the phase
of changes in the regime, owing to government reluctance or inability to
manage this crucial phase.

The Zimbabwean government has been recognised. Their Parliament is sitting.
We accept and respect that in the hope that the Zanu-PF party will honour
and respect the findings of the courts on the by-elections in those areas
where elections were challenged. We further urge the Zimbabwean government
to adhere to the UN plan for the reversal of the socioeconomic decay and
deterioration in that country.

We also urge the UK government to bear partial responsibility for the
deterioration of political relations in Zimbabwe, in so far as they have
reneged on their Lancaster House commitments. Our own Government will do
well to demonstrate its seriousness about positive assistance to Zimbabwe
by ensuring that political intolerance and intimidation are addressed in
our own country. [Time expired.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, hon members, I would like to thank this
House and the DP for the opportunity to serve the cause of democracy by
representing the South African Parliament in observing the Zimbabwean
elections. It was, indeed, an honour and a privilege. The DA congratulates
the people of Zimbabwe on their determination to vote and on demonstrating
their commitment to democratic values.

What has just happened north of the Limpopo is a clear signal to
governments that think that because they have liberated their countries,
they have a trademark over them. It is time they woke up and smelt the
coffee. The people of Africa are no longer prepared to be ruled by tyrants.
Multiparty democracy is in Africa to stay. No matter how poor people may
be, they know what they want and how they would like to be governed.

South Africa and the world have a duty to assist the brave people of
Zimbabwe to rescue their economy from politicians who would like to destroy
the country just to stay in power. We should respect the views of
Zimbabwe's elected opposition and oppose economic sanctions against
Zimbabwe. Our policy must be: firstly, economic engagement with the people
and, secondly, strong political sanctions against the ruling party. We must
be on the side of the poor, of enterprise and of economic good sense.

It does not make sense to displace some 3 million farmworkers and their
dependants, paralyse commercial agriculture and risk famine in a land of
plenty, by seizing two-thirds of white-owned farms. President Mugabe says
he will settle 500 000 landless people on the farms. Even if he succeeds,
which is unlikely given Zanu-PF's track record on land reform, this is less
than a quarter of the number of farmworkers who will lose their jobs and
homes. South Africa must oppose this plan.

Mr Mboweni complained to Parliament recently that as far as foreign
investors were concerned, the Limpopo was a river between two provinces of
South Africa. The real problem is that the South African Government has not
done enough to correct this impression. When Zimbabwe's land invasions and
the persecution of the opposition began in February, South Africa was like
a neighbour who saw the house next door on fire. We had two options: to
ignore the blaze and risk damage to our own land - hundreds of refugee
farmers and farmworkers have already crossed our borders looking for asylum
and work - or to help put out the fire. Unfortunately, President Mbeki
opted for a third course of action. He sat down and had tea with the
arsonist until the South African Government firmed up its stance on land
grabbing. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E I EBRAHIM: Madam Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, political democracy in
the form of a multiparty parliamentary system is a concept that many
countries in the developing world are grappling with. At the end of the
day, the true test of parliamentary democracy is its ability to create a
better life for the people of that particular country.

Our President made the following observation:


  ... none of us seek to impose any supposedly standard models of democracy
  on any country, but want to see systems of government in which the people
  are empowered to determine their destiny and to resolve any disputes
  among themselves by peaceful political means.

In Africa we have a vision and a mission of an African renaissance, where
we want to overcome the devastating past and ensure that Africa becomes a
continent of democracy and peace, growth and development, and prosperity
and the restoration of the dignity of all Africans. We shall have to rely a
great deal on the principles of collective self-reliance, and the
achievement of our goals depends critically on the collective interest of
the developing countries being effectively addressed. What is critical here
is the alleviation of poverty, the cancellation of foreign debt, the flow
of foreign direct investment, fair trade and transfer of technology.

Any parliamentary election on our continent or, for that matter, in the
countries of the South, must be viewed against the background of broader
issues confronting the developing world and the impact of globalisation on
developing countries. In a terrain where powerful global forces have the
power to destabilise and destroy entire countries and economies, the
successful holding and maintaining, for decades, of a democratic multiparty
parliamentary system is an achievement to take note of.

Our region has set an example in the holding of democratic elections. We
held a democratic election in our own country last year, and although
sometimes marred by tension, it was nevertheless a successful election.
Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia have had successful elections too, then
followed Zimbabwe and now Mauritius. Although there is still war in Angola
and the DRC, we can state with confidence that in the SADC region,
multiparty parliamentary democracy is, indeed, alive.

Our presence in Zimbabwe was due to our commitment to encouraging,
supporting and observing the workings of democratic institutions in our
region. The Zimbabwean election was highly contested. Not since
independence has there been such fierce contestation in a general election.
We also found that the white community, for the first time since
independence, exercised their democratic right to campaign and canvass, and
eventually turned out in large numbers to vote.

It is accepted that democracy must serve the interests of many and not a
few. International observing and monitoring of elections should be an
important component of any democratic election, as long as those doing the
monitoring do not have a hidden agenda of their own.

The alternative to regular parliamentary elections is a military
dictatorship or a one-party state. The OAU has already taken an important
and significant step in denying membership of the community of African
nations to military dictators. A one-party dictatorship does not serve the
interests of the people and violates the fundamental principles, of the
Freedom Charter which states that ``the people shall govern''. It is this
principle that has inspired Africans, and in the last decade we have
witnessed 25 countries holding multi-party elections so that the people can
decide on the government of their choice.

We have witnessed democracy in Nigeria, and recently President Diouf of
Senegal gracefully handed over power to his successor in an election. We
see shining examples of democratic elections on the African continent, even
though The Economist likes to contend that Africa is a hopeless continent
incapable of allowing its people to freely choose their governments. The
Zimbabwean election must be counted amongst those that expose the lie of
this Afro-pessimism. The African renaissance, I would say, is still alive.

Mr Van Schalkwyk, in some respects, is probably right in his confusion.
Zimbabwe teaches us that if the white minority refuses to share the wealth
accumulated through gross exploitation of the majority of the people, yes,
we could have a Zimbabwe-type of situation in South Africa. This is
something which the hon member should not tell us, but address to his
constituency, namely the captains of industry, the mining houses and the
rural landlords. [Interjections.]

At a meeting in Maputo the other day a German told us that his visit to
Africa taught him two important things. He said that there are two
important things that are close to the African, and which have been a
traumatic experience to them. One is the question of slavery, and the other
is the question of land. Africans have been made slaves and their land has
been confiscated by the colonial invaders.

Currently the world is crying for compensation for the Jewish people,
because they suffered during the Holocaust. It is correct that 50 years
after World War II they should get compensation. There is still a clamour
that they should be compensated. Nobody speaks of compensating the African
people for the atrocities they suffered during the period of slavery and
during the land invasion of Africa. If the issue of compensation is raised,
then, of course, the whole cry of racism is brought to the fore.
[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank God and this House for
the opportunity to participate in this initiative which clearly contributed
positively to a more peaceful election in Zimbabwe. Many people said our
presence inspired a confidence which dispelled fear and intimidation. We
were received with friendliness and encountered an overwhelming sense of
anticipation, excitement and determination to see change in Zimbabwe.

I remember how welcome we all felt when greeting the Zimbabwean people with
a wave and got an enthusiastic response, until I realised that our greeting
was received as an open hand, and MDC supporters were thrilled. I did not,
of course, mention it to my ANC colleagues, but I noticed a couple of days
later that they had stopped waving. For me it would, of course, have been
very rude and unfriendly to stop waving!

I was very impressed with Tony Yengeni's leadership of the delegation. I
congratulate you, Sir, on a difficult job well done. I believe every member
of the delegation should be commended for the diligent and serious manner
in which they applied themselves to their task. Everyone left South Africa
determined to be impartial and unbiased. This, however, was more difficult
than most would like to admit. I was particularly impressed as ANC
colleagues unexpectedly found themselves on the defensive every time Zanu-
PF, the ruling party, was criticised. In spite of this, I know of no member
of the delegation who shrank from confronting the facts, even when it was
dangerous or difficult to do so. [Interjections.] Balancing what we heard
with what we actually saw was no easy task as, in spite of concerns and
fears, Zimbabweans seemed determined to exercise their democratic right to
vote the way that they had intended.

It is, however, my personal opinion that farmworkers and the rural people,
especially those old enough to remember the days of liberation warfare and
the massacre by Zanu-PF of huge numbers of Matebele, were thoroughly
intimidated. I believe many of them voted Zanu-PF fearing reprisals against
them personally and their communities collectively. These threats were made
by Zanu-PF leaders and Mugabe himself. The land issue, although it was
clearly being used as an election ploy and a means of intimidating
farmworkers and rural people, was and still is an important concern.

However, most ordinary people were not even able to think about land, as
their concerns focused on Mugabe, whom they blamed for their hardships and
lack at every level. Women, in particular, expressed their contempt for
Mugabe and his wife, saying they could not be bought with a bag of sugar,
and that they refused to be treated like puppets and to be used and abused.
Women also complained of Zanu-PF using rape and the threat of rape to
intimidate them. From all accounts, it was clear that Zanu-PF-were
responsible for the violence and intimidation tactics, but the report reads
that the mission observed that ``there was no monopoly on violence''.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Ms C DUDLEY: However, there were reasons for this. I signed the report with
no reservations and believe it is a true reflection of what the delegation
observed.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, in die wêreld het Suid-Afrika se
politieke leiers nog 'n groot mate van geloofwaardigheid. Dit kan nie van
baie Afrikaleiers gesê word nie. Dit maak hierdie verslag en sy
gevolgtrekkings baie belangrik. Hierdie verslag lyk feitelik en objektief
ten opsigte van die sake wat wel daarin bespreek word. Opmerklik is tog die
sake waarna glad nie verwys word nie, en wat sonder twyfel ook 'n groot
invloed op die verkiesing en sy uitslag in Zimbabwe gehad het.

Ek verwys hier spesifiek na die besetting van blanke boere se grond en die
intimidasie en anti-wit rassisme wat daarmee gepaard gegaan het. Ons as VF
se probleem met die verslag lê in die slotparagraaf, waar daar staan:


  ... the result of the parliamentary elections ... broadly reflects the
  will of the Zimbabwean people.

Die VF verskil hiervan. Die uitslag verteenwoordig nié die wil of die wense
van die kiesers nie. Op sy beste kon die verslag gesê het ``die
gemanipuleerde wil van die kiesers'', want die regerende party het dit nie
op stemdag nie, maar tydens die aanloop tot die verkiesing deurlopend
gemanipuleer, en dit maak so 'n gevolgtrekking misleidend, wat ons betref.
Ek sal vir agb lede 'n paar voorbeelde gee.

'n Gesonde demokrasie veronderstel dat kiesers ingelig word en alle kante
van 'n saak hoor voor hulle hul keuse maak. President Mugabe se party het
ZIM$62 miljoen uit die staatskas gekry vir hulle verkiesingsveldtog. Die
hoofopposisie, die MDC, het geen fondse uit daardie oord gekry nie en moes
hul eie fondse werf. Dit is nie 'n billike verkiesing nie. Televisie in
Zimbabwe is 'n monopolie van die Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation.
Opposisiepartye het geen geleentheid op televisie gekry om hulle saak te
stel nie. Dit maak 'n normale demokrasie onmoontlik, want mense is nie
ingelig nie.

In 'n normale demokrasie is 50% stemme genoeg om 'n verkiesing te wen, maar
nie in Zimbabwe nie. Uit die 150 parlementêre setels kies president Mugabe
30 parlementslede wat hy ná die verkiesing aanwys. Die opposisie moes dus
63% van die stemme gekry het om die verkiesing te kon wen. Daarvolgens sou
die ANC in 1994 met hulle 62%-meerderheid nie kon geregeer het nie.

Van die 5,1 miljoen geregistreerde kiesers het 1,2 miljoen vir Zanu-PF
gestem. Dit beteken Zanu-PF het 24% van die stemme gekry, maar hulle het
tans ongeveer 62% van die setels. Teen hierdie agtergrond maak die VF
beswaar teen die sin in die verslag wat lui:


   ... the result ... reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.

Suid-Afrika se internasionale geloofwaardigheid is só belangrik, ons kan
nie bekostig dat ons ter wille van goeie verhoudings of ter wille van
politieke korrektheid ons geloofwaardigheid permanent daarmee heen laat
gaan nie, en ek dink die verslag kon deurgegaan het bloot as 'n feitelike
weergawe van wat daar gebeur het in plaas daarvan dat ons lyk asof ons met
hierdie gevolgtrekking Zimbabwe wil ter wille wees. Ons weet Mugabe se
posisie is tydelik. Hy sal nie meer lank daar wees nie, en daarná moet ons
met die werklikhede saamleef. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, South Africa's political leaders still
have a great deal of credibility in the world. This cannot be said of many
African leaders. That makes this report and its conclusions very important.
This report appears factual and objective in regard to the issues which are
discussed in it. What is noteworthy are the issues which are not referred
to at all, and which undoubtedly also had a big impact on the election and
its result in Zimbabwe.
Here I am referring specifically to the occupation of white farmers' land
and the intimidation and anti-white racism which went along with it. The
problem we as the FF have with the report is contained in the concluding
paragraph, in which it is stated:


  ... the result of the parliamentary elections ... broadly reflects the
  will of the Zimbabwean people.

The FF differs with this. The result does not represent the will or the
wishes of the voters. At best the report could have said ``the manipulated
will of the voters'', because the ruling party did not manipulate it on
polling day, but consistently during the run-up to the election, and, as
far as we are concerned, this makes such a conclusion misleading. I will
give hon members a few examples.

A sound democracy presupposes that voters are informed and hear all sides
of a matter before making their choice. President Mugabe's party received
ZIM$62 million from the treasury for their election campaign. The main
opposition, the MDC, received no funding from that source and had to raise
their own money. That is not a fair election. Television in Zimbabwe is a
monopoly of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation. Opposition parties
received no opportunity to state their case on television. This makes a
normal democracy impossible, because people are not informed.

In a normal democracy 50% of the votes are sufficient to win an election,
but not in Zimbabwe. Of the 150 parliamentary seats, President Mugabe
chooses 30 member of parliament whom he appoints after the election. The
opposition would therefore have had to obtain 63% of the votes to be able
to win the election. In these terms the ANC would not have been able to
govern with their 62% majority in 1994.

Of the 5,1 million registered voters 1,2 million voted for Zanu-PF. This
means that Zanu-PF got 24% of the votes, but they currently have
approximately 62% of the seats. Against this background the FF objects to
the sentence in the report which reads:


  ... the result ... reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.

South Africa's international credibility is so important that we cannot
afford to lose our credibility permanently for the sake of good relations
or for the sake of political correctness, and I think that the report could
have gone through merely as a factual version of what happened instead of
us looking as though we want to oblige Zimbabwe with this conclusion. We
know that Mugabe's position is temporary. He is not going to be there much
longer and after that we will have to live with the realities.]

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, I just want to reiterate the thanks to
Parliament, my party and those members that attended the observer mission
for a job well done.

The Zimbabwean elections have come and gone and the results are well known
to the members of the House. Our report notes that violence and
intimidation did in fact occur prior to the election, and Zimbabwean
opposition parties and their candidates, in certain areas, were unable to
canvass freely. This was confirmed by about 22 of the 27 stakeholder groups
and many other private and personal contacts that we made while in
Zimbabwe. Most of it was systematic and targeted, and clearly had the
support of the Zanu-PF government. At the end of the day, under very
adverse conditions of fear, threats and violence, democracy ruled. After 20
years, the Zimbabwean electorate, where possible, voted with their heads as
opposed to their hearts in bringing an end to 20 years of one-party rule.

Without the rule of law democracy cannot flourish; without a free press and
media uncontrolled by government influences, the electorate cannot be well
informed of their choices; without multiparty democracy within the various
spheres of government, the government cannot be held to account; without
clear legislation and policies properly mandated by the electorate, chaos
such as that experienced by the expropriation of land and associated land
invasions will also be an occurrence here in South Africa; and unless our
police force is impartial, our public will have no faith in bringing our
criminals to book.

Much of Zimbabwe's economy is vested in the agricultural and tourism
industries, and the lack of rule of law there has contributed primarily to
Zimbabwe's present economic mess. This has spilt over into our country and
the region in general. We must never allow the rule of law to be undermined
in South Africa. One of the best briefings which we received was from the
Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers' Union. They conveyed their appreciation of our
President's quiet diplomacy approach to President Mugabe, in particular to
the politically motivated land invasions that were taking place before and
during the elections. In retrospect one wonders how effective this approach
has been, particularly in regard to the impact it had on Zimbabwe's economy
and the violence and killings that were associated with it.

Nearly 40% of Zimbabwe's export earnings are derived from agriculture and
in addition agriculture contributes some 18% of the GDP. About 76% of the
total population of the country is entirely dependent on agriculture, yet
President Mugabe has senselessly attempted to damage this sector of the
economy. Our country has been intimately affected by the bad governance of
Zimbabwe and yet for lesser reasons our Government chose to intervene in
Lesotho. One wonders why. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, comrades and colleagues, the people of Zimbabwe
have expressed their will in the June 2000 parliamentary elections. Through
their votes they have re-emphasised the fact that Zimbabwe will never be a
colony again. Indeed the people have spoken. They have spoken loudly and
clearly against discrimination, poverty, landlessness, hunger and disease.
It is regrettable that their pre-election campaign was characterised by
violence. We cannot deny the fact that even our own country's elections
have been characterised by these unfortunate incidents.

The experience of Zimbawe and our own experience should be a lesson to the
rest of Africa that incident-free elections are an integral part of a
democratic society. The Zimbabwean elections were run under the auspices of
four structures. The first was the delimitation commission which was headed
by a judge of the supreme court and was responsible for dividing the
country into constituencies. The second was the registrar general who
carries out all registration responsibilities in that country including
voter registration, compilation of the voters' roll and also providing the
delimitation commission with the necessary information to delimit
constituencies. He is also responsible for vote counting, the appointment
of presiding officers and staff and the announcement of results. It is
important to note that the registrar general has provincial counterparts
who handle such responsibilities at provincial level.

Thirdly, there was the election directorate, which is constituted by senior
representatives of relevant government departments and is responsible for
all logistical arrangements for elections. Fourthly there was the electoral
supervisory commission, which oversees the processes of registration,
campaigning, voting and counting of votes. This body also has the authority
to pronounce itself on the status of elections.

On the basis of briefings we received from both the registrar general and
the provincial registrars, and based on our own observations, it was clear,
even before the elections, that the above structures had done thorough
preparations for voting and vote counting. However, we received complaints
regarding various aspects of election preparation. For example, there were
allegations that the names of a number of dead people were still on the
voters' roll.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, could you please lower your voices,
so that the hon member's speech can be heard.

Ms M C LOBE: The registrar-general confirmed this possibility, but was
confident that no one could vote on behalf of a dead person due to tight
procedures during voting, which included the use of a voter's card and
indelible ink. There were also allegations that the ballot boxes had
removable bottoms, and that that would lead to fraud. The mission took it
upon itself to follow up this matter and the allegation was proved to be
unfounded.

As a result of the fact that a significant number of people did not appear
on the voters' roll, a supplementary voters' roll was introduced to
accommodate such individuals. This supplementary voters' roll was not
easily accessible to all candidates because it became available at a very
late date, but it assisted a lot of Zimbabweans to exercise their right to
participate in the fifth parliamentary elections in June.

Although the pre-election period was characterised by tensions, a lack of
political tolerance and violence, especially on some commercial farms and
in rural areas, the voting and counting process took place in a peaceful
and calm atmosphere. It is very clear that the presence of observers
contributed to this calm and peaceful atmosphere. The presence of a minimum
of three police officers in each polling station also contributed to the
peaceful conduct of the elections.

The prophets of doom predicted a very low voter turn-out as a result of
violence, and that election days would be characterised by incidents of
violence. Much to their surprise, more than 2,5 million votes were cast out
of 5,1 million registered voters. About 50% of registered voters cast their
votes, which makes the process not only credible but also legitimate.

The mission was impressed by the high voter turn-out, and the discipline
and commitment of voters, despite the long queues. The mission was also
impressed by the high levels of efficiency and professionalism on the part
of electoral officers. In the interest of transparency and security, the
ballot boxes were guarded overnight by the police and polling agents. These
polling agents were provided with transport to accompany boxes to the
counting stations.

Although the process of counting took very long, it was also extensive.
This process was characterised by a meticulous and transparent process of
reconciling votes cast with ballot papers issued. Any possibility of
election fraud was ruled out by this extensive process. Despite all the
reports from some institutions and the media, it was very clear that the
election process in Zimbabwe was efficiently run and had an equally
efficient and committed electoral staff.

As a country, we need to learn from this experience in order to improve our
own electoral system. It is against this background that the ANC is
convinced that the people of Zimbabwe have expressed their will. Indeed,
Zimbabwe will never be a colony again. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, Africa continues to suffer
destruction in its political processes because African cultures have been
broken down by imperialists' and colonialists' conquests. The result is
that the western type of political systems are then imposed upon them, and
some leaders remain caught in the rut.

The climate prior to the elections in Zimbabwe was heated up owing to the
land issue. There were sporadic acts of violence and intimidation. Certain
areas were declared ``no-go'' areas. In the run-up to the elections,
tempers cooled off, and the Movement for Democratic Change brought to light
political and racial contradictions in Zimbabwe. Two independent
institutions, Amnesty International and the Helen Suzman Foundation, made
these discoveries. A climate of terror did not create an environment which
was conducive to free and fair elections. Violence and intimidation were
most serious in rural areas, and the Zimbabwean print media and the
Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation disregarded participants outside Zanu-PF.
They concentrated only on the ruling party.

However, at the end of the day, 82% of the voters believed that the ballot
was secret. The MDC won 57 seats against the 62 seats won by Mugabe's Zanu-
PF. This is despite all the state machinery in the form of the army which
was assaulting supporters of opposition parties and the funding which was
at Mugabe's disposal. It is, therefore, not illogical to say that had the
elections really been free and fair, and had public funding been equally
accessible to all parties, the MDC would have taken home the bacon.

The Zimbabwean election is a lesson to be learned by those in power. It is
not the bullet but the ballot that places a party in power. Arrogance and
intimidation do not help the cause of any party. Though the terrain was
uneven and the going was tough, the Zimbabweans did well under those
circumstances. The bottom line is that the findings of our parliamentary
delegation regarding the fairness and the free nature of the elections in
Zimbabwe are, by and large, corroborated by Amnesty International and the
Helen Suzman Foundation. Under the circumstances, we would say: ``Well
done, colleagues.''

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC appreciates the debate on the report
on Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe and its president, Robert Mugabe, have been the
subject of newspaper headlines, editorials, and television and radio
comments. Some of these comments have been negative about Zimbabwe and its
recent elections which were won by Zanu-PF.

The PAC leadership met a delegation of Zanu-PF members in Johannesburg
before the elections. A PAC delegation travelled to Zimbabwe during the
elections to express solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe regarding their
land dispossession by colonial invaders led by Cecil Rhodes. The invaders
called that country ``Rhodesia''. They evicted Africans from the fertile
land by force through the use of arms, and no one then spoke of the rule of
law and human rights. Consequently, 0,03% of the settler population owns 12
million hectares of land, that is, 73% of arable land in Zimbabwe.

All that Mugabe and his colleagues demanded was that at least 50% of this
land be returned to 12 million landless Africans wallowing in the quagmire
of poverty, landlessness and unemployment. Justice-loving people believe
that whatever mistakes Zimbabwe's president made on this question of
finally redistributing African land to African people, he is 100% right. As
a Kenyan observer put it, ``Mugabe's only fault is that he took too long to
do it, but now that he is doing it, people who believe in fairness and
justice must support him.'' Rather than prove anything against Mugabe, the
West's accusations only prove how little it thinks of Africans' rights to
own anything or have meaningful independence. Could one even imagine a
situation in which 4 000 Zimbabweans would be allowed to own 12 million
hectares of land in Britain or France, or be entitled to recover land they
stole from the British or French?

In this country our forefathers, in the wars of national resistance against
colonial aggression, fought to retain the land of their ancestors. They
realised the importance of this basic national asset. Wars of liberation,
through Apla and other forces, were also primarily about land. Today this
important asset has been compromised for flag independence and confused
with national anthems. Unfortunately, although the Native Land Act of 1913
has been replaced with section 25(7) of the South African Constitution, it
guarantees the properties of the haves, which have been acquired. Their
economic oppression and their evictions from a small piece of land are a
time-bomb. [Time expired.]

Mr M MPEHLE: Madam Speaker, before I start delivering my speech according
to my notes, I would like to take off from the point that was made by the
hon Mzizi, who drew our attention to the possible problems that could arise
in our case with regard to the question of land.

I want to take the opportunity to assure and re-assure our farmers in this
country that, for as long as they abide by the laws of this Government and
for as long as they do not continue to paint our people's bodies with black
paint, they are safe in this country. The laws that we have made guarantee
them that, provided that they operate within the framework that has been
set up by this Parliament and this Government.

A number of previous speakers raised the question of land in Zimbabwe. That
is the topic I would like to deal with, and I plead with all the hon
members of Parliament here to take and put the land question in Zimbabwe in
its proper perspective. I have not heard anyone here doing that job. So, my
job will be to provide a framework upon which we can have a fruitful
discussion in so far as the land situation in Zimbabwe is concerned. But,
to do this, I must definitely give some historical background on what
happened to the land of the Zimbabweans when they were invaded by the
agencies of British colonialism, and what happened in Lancaster House where
there was a meeting and negotiations for the resolution of the armed
struggle in that country.

I should also warn and inform hon members that when colonisers invade
foreign lands, they grab, they kill, they burn, they rape, and they loot.
They herd together the subjects in the most uninhabitable areas in the
conquered countries. They behave in the same way, be it in the Americas,
Asia or Africa. They never consider the long-term consequences of their
ungodly actions. They finally bequeath to succeeding generations complex
and painful problems whose solutions demand, at times, very painful
surgical operations.

Before we become judges - if that is what we must be - on the question of
the land problem in that country, or whatever we want to call it, let us
know and understand fully what happened to the land question yesterday -
that is, in the past, before the Zimbabwean people gained their political
rights. What happened around this land question in Zimbabwe yesterday
enables us to understand what is happening today in so far as the white
farms in that country are concerned; and that, in itself, gives us the
basis on which we can plan and analyse what is going to happen tomorrow.
The purpose of my speech is to provide a framework within which we can have
this discussion.

The land problem in Zimbabwe began in 1889 when Cecil John Rhodes annexed
that country. The annexation was in the interest of the British South
Africa Company and British colonialism, wherein Cecil John Rhodes signed
immediately what is known as the Rudd Concession with the king of the
Ndebele, King Lobengula. The signing of that concession, which was a trick
by Rhodes, gave away that country to the British South Africa Company.

Of course, the signing of spurious treaties was fundamental to the British
policy of colonialism. Immediately after the signing of the Rudd
Concession, Rhodes organised hundreds of white settlers and armed bandits.
These white settlers, together with these armed bandits, entered Zimbabwe
and set up their operational centre and base in what is today called
Harare.

When they realised that they had been cheated by Rhodes through the
infamous Rudd Concession, the Ndebele under the leadership of their king,
Lobengula, went to war against the forces of the British South African
Company in 1893. The Ndebele were, of course, ruthlessly crushed. The
defeat of Lobengula's forces virtually gave the British South Africa
Company control over Matabeleland. Encouraged by its escapades, the forces
of the British South Africa Company moved into the lands which were under
the control and jurisdiction of the Shona-speaking people.

In defence of their land, the Ndebele-speaking and Shona-speaking people
combined their fighting forces, but they were defeated in 1897. This marked
a new chapter for the people of that country in the struggle in defence of
their land, and at the same time, it was the opening of a new chapter.
Britain had become the colonial overlord of Zimbabwe. Through a series of
pieces of legislations, Britain acquired control over the economy of
Zimbabwe, wherein funds from various activities in that country were
repatriated to the British Treasury in London.

In line with the British colonial policy in South Africa in particular, the
so-called native reserves were created in Zimbabwe. Those of us who have
lived - and continue to live - in those areas which were designated native
reserves will tell all hon members about these areas. They will tell about
the condemned lives of those who were regarded as God's stepchildren by the
rulers of our country; and this continued up to the dawn of the new
political dispensation in 1994.

By the beginning of the First World War, Zimbabwe had a white settler
community which made up 3% of the total population, and which controlled
75% of all the economically productive land. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, may I start by congratulating the mission on a
report that reflects thorough and systematic work and is quite user-
friendly.

Mr J H MOMBERG: Mooi, Cassie! [Well done, Cassie!]

Mr C AUCAMP: Unfortunately, that is where it ends, Oom Jannie! [Laughter.]

The crux of the report is the conclusion that the results of the election
broadly reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people.

Die vraag is of die vlag die lading dek. [The question is whether the flag
protects the cargo.]

In other words, is the conclusion at the end justified in the light of the
facts reflected in the report? I beg to differ.

Op stemdag het dinge blykbaar heel goed verloop, maar wat van die
voorafgaande proses? In die verslag word die volgende genoem: [Apparently
matters ran smoothly on polling day, but what about the preceding process?
In the report the following is mentioned:]
  ... Zanu-PF ... received some Z$ 65 million per annum from the State. All
  the other parties ... had to fundraise from other sources.

Surely, the playing field was not level at all. Secondly, the Zimbabwe
Broadcasting Corporation, which, as the report says, has a monopoly over
the electronic media, gave inordinate coverage to Zanu-PF. This is not a
true democratic process. To what extent was ``the will of the Zimbabwean
people'', as the report says, rather the will of the ``ZABC'' inflicted on
the people?

Die verslag maak melding van klagtes oor kiesafdelingafbakenings, oor
kieserslyste en oor 'n laat aanvullende kieserslys, maar gee nie 'n
uitspraak daaroor nie. Oor die klagte ten opsigte van stembusse waarvan die
bodems dalk vals was, sê hulle dit is ongegrond. Moet ons aanneem dat die
ander klagtes wel gegrond was? Dit wat betref die gebeure in die tydperk
van 20 dae wat ons afvaardiging daar was, maar wat van die maande vooraf?

Wat van die intimidasie, van die verontagsaming van die beginsels van 'n
regstaat? Demokrasie, veiligheid en stabiliteit is oorboord gegooi toe
gewelddadig van regeringskant op vreedsame optoggangers losgebrand is. Wat
van die totale verontagsaming van 'n bevel van die hooggeregshof en die
skending van die reg op vryheid van uitdrukking van sy burgers en die
eensydige steun van die Zimbabwiese polisiemag aan wetverbrekers?

Kom ek gebruik 'n beeld. Die verkiesingswedloop het kop aan kop geëindig.
Zanu-PF en die MDC is amper gelyk oor die wenstreep en almal sê wat 'n
pragtige wedloop. Ons afvaardiging kom daar aan nadat vier van die vyf
rondtes al verby is. Hulle kyk en hulle sê nee, die manne hardloop mooi,
hier kom 'n ding.

Intussen vergeet hulle dat die wegspring totaal ongelyk was, dat die MDC
vasgehou is deur onwettige inmenging en blokkering, dat Zanu-PF die eerste
paar rondtes op alle onwettige maniere kortpad geneem het en deur
ontoelaatbare metodes die opponente van die baan af geskouer het. Ons moet
daarteen waak dat die kop aan kop uitslag ons oë sluit vir die
onreëlmatighede.

Verder moet ek sê dat die optrede nie die toets van regverdigheid slaag
nie. Sekere dele van die inhoud van die verslag onderstreep dit, en die
hele ondemokratiese aanloop die afgelope maand sê dit ook. My dank aan die
afvaardiging vir goeie werk, maar die AEB kan hom nie met die bevinding van
hierdie verslag vereenselwig nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The report mentions complaints about constituency demarcations, about
voters' rolls and about a late supplementary voters' roll, but does not
make any pronouncements in this regard. As regards complaints in respect of
ballot boxes which possibly had false bottoms, they say that these were
unfounded. Must we accept that the other complaints were justified? This in
regard to the events taking place during the period of 20 days that our
delegation was there, but what about the months prior to that?

What about the intimidation, the disregard for the principles of a
constitutional state? Democracy, safety and stability were thrown overboard
when peaceful protesters bore the brunt of violent behaviour on the part of
the government. What about the total disregard for an order of the supreme
court and the violation of the right to freedom of expression of its
citizens and the one-sided support given by the Zimbabwean police force to
law-breakers?
Let me use a metaphor. The election race ends neck and neck. Zanu-PF and
the MDC almost cross the finish line at the same time and everyone says
what a wonderful race it was. Our delegation arrives there after four of
the five laps have already been run. They look and say that the men are
running well, this is going to be quite something.

In the meantime they forget that the start was completely uneven, that the
MDC was held back by unlawful interference and obstruction, and that Zanu-
PF took short cuts in the first few laps in every possible unlawful way and
shouldered their opponents from the track using impermissible methods. We
have to guard against the even result making us blind to the
irregularities.

Furthermore, I have to say that the behaviour does not stand the test of
fairness. Certain parts of the content of the report highlight this, and
the whole undemocratic run-up over the past month also indicates this. My
thanks go to the delegation for the good work they have done, but the AEB
cannot associate itself with the findings of this report.]

The election did not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people, and I think
we must act accordingly.

Mr M A MANGENA: Madam Speaker, by all accounts the mission sent by this
Parliament to observe the Zimbabwean national elections behaved
professionally. It respected the Zimbabwean people and their electoral
process. It was efficient and competent in the execution of its mandate.
Murmurs of bias on the part of the mission towards Zanu-PF proved to have
no basis. We congratulate the members of that mission for a job well done.

The more profound congratulations go to the people of Zimbabwe for
successfully concluding their elections under very trying conditions. Those
elections aroused intense passions worldwide. They took place under
circumstances where the traditional and entrenched economic interests of
some powerful people and their allies seemed under threat. It seemed
Zimbabweans were no longer behaving like well-schooled and conditioned
subjects of colonialism and neocolonialism. They have embarked on a path
that challenged conventional rules of property ownership and generally
expected reverence of the powerful countries of the North by all of us in
the South.

The ruling party in that country was under attack from the international
community and its media, and there was no doubt that a different electoral
outcome than what we have at the moment was desired by many. It was
therefore very good and even crucial that neighbours of Zimbabwe such as
ourselves and other SADC countries, regardless of our views on their
programmes, sent observers there to cushion them against pressures of the
powerful Western countries. The more balanced atmosphere, to which we
contributed by our presence, allowed them to exercise their rights and
their sovereignty with less tension and pressure.

As African countries and societies, we should work hard to remove
conditions that prompt others to come and monitor and observe our
elections. Every time one or other African country holds elections, it is
as if they are children writing examinations, therefore requiring
invigilators. Of course we are, at the end of it all, given some ratings
which determine whether we get aid or good treatment from the richer
countries of the world. This demeaning situation can only be changed by us
and we should do it. [Applause.]

Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, I, like many members of the South African
parliamentary observer mission, would like to express my gratitude to the
House for having been given the opportunity to participate in observing the
recent parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe, and to make a contribution in
the process of consolidating and strengthening democracy on our continent.
The sense of gratitude is all the greater because, as the observer
mission's report states, we were very conscious of the importance of our
mission, because Zimbabwe is South Africa's neighbour and our nations share
deep historical, political and cultural ties.

During the course of our mission the depth of these ties was clear at all
times. It is clear that our nations are inextricably linked and our
destinies intertwined. For this reason, whilst our mission was to observe,
we could never do so merely as passive, unattached and disinterested
outsiders looking on, safe in the knowledge that once our bags were packed,
we would not be affected by what we had been observing. We were conscious
that South Africa and Zimbabwe shared a history of struggle against
colonialism and racial oppression, that the graves of the fallen heroes of
the Wanghe campaign lie in Zimbabwe, that many Zimbabweans still bear the
scars of the destabilisation campaign that was waged because of the
Zimbabwean people's support for our liberation struggle.

We were conscious that Zimbabwe is South Africa's biggest trading partner
on the African continent and the eighth biggest trading partner in the
world. In 1998 South Africa imported R1 billion from Zimbabwe, much of it
raw materials and agricultural produce, and exported R5 billion to
Zimbabwe, mostly manufactured products. Over and above these formal trade
links, there is vibrant and growing undeclared, mainly informal, trade
between South Africa and Zimbabwe. Whilst it is difficult to quantify this
trade, the fact that in 1996, 194 000 visas were issued by the South
African Consulate in Harare serves as some indication of its extent.

We were very conscious of the fact that, notwithstanding the differences of
approach and emphasis on certain issues, South Africa and Zimbabwe share
the vision of a better Southern African region and a better continent, and
we are co-operating in multilateral institutions such as SADC, the OAU and
the UN to realise this shared vision. For these reasons we were aware of
the damage and setbacks that South Africa would suffer should Zimbabwe fail
and, accordingly, of the need to carry out our mission in the most
disciplined and responsible manner.

Therefore, the remarks made by the hon Mr Van Schalkwyk are saddening. He
made three very contestable statements: Firstly, that the South African
Government was turning a blind eye to human rights violations. I think that
is a repugnant statement, coming from the leader of a party that conducted
a destabilisation campaign from which the Southern African region is only
now starting to recover. Since 1994 the South African Government has
embarked on probably the strongest campaign to bring peace, stability and
democracy not only in Southern Africa, but on the continent as a whole.

Secondly, he alleged that the approach of silent diplomacy was wrong. There
are many Zimbabweans who would differ with Mr Van Schalkwyk, including
members of the Commercial Farmers' Union who, when meeting with the
delegation, thanked us and requested us to convey their sense of gratitude
for the approach that our President had been following.

The third issue that Mr Van Schalkwyk raised was the visit to President
Mugabe. We were surprised that he raised this issue because this matter had
been discussed in our delegation and all members of the delegation had
accepted the explanation given for that visit. The fact of the matter is
that the work of the parliamentary observer mission had officially been
concluded by the time that visit took place. Therefore, that visit had
nothing to do with the mission. It is not contained in our report, and we
do not know why Mr Van Schalkwyk raised the issue.

Lastly, the mission provided many of us with the opportunity to observe a
nation that, in 20 years of independence, has succeeded in making huge
improvements in the lives of its people. Zimbabwe has established an
education system in which primary school attendance rose from 820 000 to 2
264 000 and secondary school attendance rose from 60 000 to 600 000 from
1979 to 1987. We observed that even in the remotest rural areas, there was
access to schools and veterinary clinics, all within walking distance.

It is clear that our nations have much to learn from each other and much to
gain from co-operating. We hope that the parliamentary elections in
Zimbabwe have further strengthened and consolidated democracy on our
continent, and that South Africa and Zimbabwe will continue co-operating to
improve the lives of our people and the people of Africa. On behalf of the
ANC, I move that the House adopt the report of the South African
parliamentary observer mission. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Before coming to the adoption of the report, I
would like to express the appreciation of the Speaker and myself, not only
to this Parliament for having sent this observer mission, but also to the
delegation that went to Zimbabwe and the manner in which they discharged
the mission that they had been given by this Parliament. Hopefully, they
have set a precedent that is quite worthy of building on and in fact
improving on in future. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Report adopted (Freedom Front and Afrikaner Eenheidsbeweging dissenting).

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker and hon members, after tabling the
adjustments estimate of last year, circumstances necessitated that certain
amounts be provided that were not included in the adjustments estimate.
These amounts have been authorised in terms of section 71 of the Exchequer
Act of 1975. Subsection 2 also determines that steps be taken not later
than during the next ensuing session of Parliament for the appropriation of
any amounts which had been utilised in terms of subsection 1. Madam
Speaker, I move.

Bill together with introductory speech and papers tabled, referred to the
Portfolio Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

                   COUNCIL FOR MEDICAL SCHEMES LEVIES BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, the Medical Schemes Act of 1998
establishes a Council for Medical Schemes to perform all the regulatory
oversight functions required for the implementation of the Act. The Council
for Medical Schemes Levies Bill, in turn, establishes a levy financing
framework for the Council for Medical Schemes. This is a very long speech
which I have just made, therefore, I move.

Bill, together with introductory speech, referred to the Portfolio
Committee on Health for consideration and report in accordance with earlier
resolution.

                                FINANCE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, the Finance Bill is essentially the
requirement in law to confirm here a series of decisions that have been
taken by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts so that expenditures
that were deemed to have been unauthorised can now be regularised and
properly accounted for. I move the Finance Bill of 2000.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, the objective of the Finance Bill reads as
follows:

  To charge the National Revenue Fund with certain unauthorised expenditure
  and to authorise other expenditure; to regulate the closure of certain
  obsolete revenue accounts; and to provide for matters connected
  therewith.

The expenses outlined in this Bill stretch over the financial periods of
1991 to 1997 as indicated in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of the Bill, and amount to
a total of approximately R4,3 billion. Clause 1 amounts to approximately
R133,8 million or 3,12% of the total amount. The unauthorised expenditure
has to be paid over to the National Revenue Fund. These funds will have to
be refunded to the relevant departments as a direct charge against the
National Revenue Fund. Clause 2 amounts to approximately R15,1 million or
0,4% of the total amount. This unauthorised expenditure has not been paid
over and need therefore not be refunded. With regard to clause 3, the bulk
of expenses as outlined in Schedule 3 to this Bill relate to the
expenditure of the former TBVC states and the self-governing territories,
and this covers 96,5% of the total amount, which is approximately R4,1
billion.

Frequently, we hear in this House that we must stop blaming apartheid, but
the bulk of these expenses are from the former TBVC states and self-
governing territories which were the creation of the previous apartheid
government, whose members have now renamed themselves the Democratic
Alliance. So, the words of the song After changes we're more or less the
same by Bob Dylan should fit the DA. [Interjections.]

Mrs M P COETZEE-KASPER: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I observe that
the television sets are off. What if a fire breaks out all of a sudden?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The screens are clear. It seems that is
something that concerns the technical team. Can the technical staff just
find out what is going on, or whether the sound system is affecting the
screens, because if the sound system is on and we are recording, we can go
ahead without the TV screens. [Interjections.]

Mrs R R JOEMAT: I am still speaking about the unauthorised expenses of the
former TBVC states and the self-governing territories. The provincial
public accounts committees in the provinces were tasked with investigating
the circumstances in which the expenditure had occurred. They have made
recommendations regarding the possible authorisation of these expenses. The
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, in order to enable the provinces to
clear the relevant book entries, therefore recommended that the
unauthorised expenditure, as listed, be submitted for authorisation by
Parliament.

The committee further recommended, as stipulated in the Bill, that any
legal entitlement regarding the potential recovery of any losses to the
state, owing to the unauthorised expenditure in question, must remain. We
must emphasise that unauthorised expenses cannot be justified. We must
ensure that unauthorised expenses are brought down to a nonexistent level
in Government. The new Public Finance Management Act will be a deterrent to
any accounting officer who is negligent or ignores proper procedures. In
terms of the said Act the accounting officer must exercise all reasonable
care by implementing effective, efficient and transparent processes of
financial and risk management to prevent and detect unauthorised,
irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenses.

The accounting officer will have to have the power to act against any
person responsible for unauthorised or wasteful expenses. The Pubic Finance
Management Act echoes the Public Service regulations by assigning greater
responsibility and allowing greater powers to accounting officers, and
provides the means by which any accounting officer will be held
accountable. The effective management of finance in the public sector is
pivotal to good governance in order to improve the quality and efficiency
of service delivery. When the Public Finance Management Act was signed into
law it indicated that the ANC-led Government had taken a significant step
towards modernising financial management in the public sector. Therefore,
the ANC supports this Bill before us. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Finance Bill before us today
deals with the past in a number of ways, as the schedules show. Not only
does the Bill seek to authorise certain categories of unauthorised
expenditure and finally unwind a legacy of geographic Balkanisation, but it
also serves as a poignant reminder of the vagaries of an inadequate system
of financial management which we must symbolically bury today with the
passage of this Bill.

The Bill before us seeks to wrap up the writing off of R4,1 billion in
unauthorised expenditure, which was recommended to be dealt with in this
manner by resolutions of Parliament's Standing Committee on Public
Accounts. While the DP supports this Bill, it is with an element of concern
at the impression which could be created by Parliament passing a law
authorising that unauthorised expenditure be defrayed from the National
Revenue Fund. We sincerely hope that this potential message will be drowned
out loudly and clearly by the rigorous implementation of the Public Finance
Management Act to ensure that our civil service becomes a lean and mean,
value-for-money-based machine over which the Auditor-General can preside
with far more stringent tools at his disposal, instead of having to issue
qualifying statements with many of the departments' accounts.

South Africa's democratically elected Parliament has chosen to address the
effects of inadequate public finance management through the passage of the
Public Finance Management Act which came into force in April this year. In
the aftermath of yesterday's Standing Committee on Public Accounts hearing
on the Public Finance Management Act, it is no understatement to say that
we are eagerly awaiting Cabinet's final green light, and targeted guidance
by the Department of Finance and other role-players, for the Public Finance
Management implementation plan to make its presence and its effects felt
throughout the South African civil service so that we avoid instances such
as the unauthorised expenditure we have in the Bill before us today.

While the Finance Bill seeks to authorise this expenditure, it does not do
so in a blanket fashion to the exclusion of efforts to recoup the spent
funds. Clause 5 of the Bill makes specific provision for actions of
recovery of the money to continue, and states clearly that the Finance Bill
may not be construed as affecting any action to recover unauthorised
expenditure. Thus the Bill makes express provision to ensure that any legal
entitlement regarding the potential recovery of any losses to the state,
owing to the unauthorised expenditure in question, must remain. As this
residual right is expressly maintained in clause 5, the Finance Bill should
be favourably considered.

We must move away from the emphasis which South Africa's public finance
legislation placed on authorised and unauthorised expenditure in the
previous Exchequer Act to a responsible and responsive public finance
management approach under the provisions of our new legislation. This would
be consistent with the axiom that managers should manage and that directors-
general as accounting officers, should have the responsibility and ability
to make assessments on whether or not the South African taxpayers, who are
the end users of Government services in a context in which poverty
alleviation is a poignant imperative, are indeed getting the maximum amount
of bang for their taxpaying buck. If they fail to make this assessment they
will clearly be accountable. It is in this context of unauthorised
expenditure that the Public Finance Management Act should have drawn far
clearer lines of political accountability for Ministers, vis-à-vis their
directors-general. This will be one of the challenges that remain.

Clearly, a more focused approach to poverty alleviation dictates that we
need to move to a system in which we sufficiently cost inputs and outputs
and guard against squandering and irresponsible expenditure, with not only
the rigour of the accountant, but also with the socially aware conscience
of a true public representative that expects topnotch performance from the
bureaucracy. At the same time, however, such a move dictates that we must
draw far clearer lines of accountability for Ministers in the Public
Finance Management Act and in the financial chain of accountability. It is
hoped that this will indeed be the case as the Director-General of Finance
has already assured Standing Committee on Public Accounts that Ministers
have been amongst the most ardent attenders of workshops on the Public
Finance Management Act.

It is worth reminding Parliament that the latest annual report by the
Auditor-General yet again raises concerns about the weaknesses in state
accounts. These weaknesses will not be taken away by the passage of a law
such as the Public Finance Management Act, and many challenges remain if we
are not to repeat many of the mistakes of the past which we seek to address
in today's Finance Bill. We need to be honest and upfront about the
challenges that lie ahead if we are to realise the inherent value in the
new Public Finance Management Act.

The clear and present challenge is the head-hunting of sufficient skills,
both by Government departments and the Office of the Auditor-General, to
ensure that we have the skills pool to effectively implement the Act. At
the same time, the training of public finance managers at all three levels
of Government will be a mammoth task and a sufficient and reliable source
of trainers will have to be found to undertake this task. It is to be
welcomed that Institute for Public Finance and Auditing, IPFA, and the
Public Service Commission are already working on a project to ensure the
necessary accreditation.

When the country's Auditor-General warns us and slates the Public Service
as a stagnant and bureaucratic employer, incapable of attracting enough top-
skilled staff even if it could offer competitive salaries, we need to take
serious stock of the problems in a rigorous and uncompromising manner. The
ethos change in the civil service, which the Auditor-General has referred
to, is a non-negotiable prerequisite to seeing a real turnaround in the
state of Government finances and a reduction in the number of departments
that receive qualified audit reports from the Auditor-General's office.

Only a carrot and stick approach will move us away from the irresponsible
approach to public finance management which speaks so clearly in Schedule 1
to the Bill before us today. While we have seen a dramatic drop in the
level of unauthorised expenditure, down from R763 million to R156 million,
the battle for sound financial management is far from won. We have the
Public Finance Management Act as the carrot, which could act as a catalyst
for the ethos change that we require in the civil service, but this will
not be sufficient. We also need the stick, the stick that will be a
deterrent to civil servants maximising their own self-interest and using
the public purse to that end, as opposed to maximising the interests of the
poor.

In his foreword to the Public Finance Management Act, the Minister cites
its ambitious aims to modernise public sector financial management, and I
quote:


  The key objectives of the Act may be summarised as being to modernise the
  system of financial management, enable public sector managers to manage,
  but at the same time be more accountable, ensure the timely provision of
  quality information, and eliminate waste and corruption in the use of
  public assets.

Few would argue that the Finance Bill before us today contains at least
elements of waste and corruption. Be it pre-1994 or post-1994, the
principle of unacceptability stands unquestioned. It is with this
acknowledgement in mind that the President has also, on numerous occasions,
warned civil servants who maximise their own self-interest. The missing and
admittedly short-term ingredient in South Africa is a strong and clear anti-
corruption Act which could dovetail quite strongly with the new Public
Finance Management Act and ensure that we eliminate not only wasteful
expenditure, but also a corrupt siphoning off of revenue intended for
service delivery and the poor. With these provisos and future indicators of
the ethos change that we need and the challenges remaining for the Public
Finance Management Act, the DP supports the Finance Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, further to what has already been said, in
particular about the coming of the new Public Finance Management Act, the
PFMA, we note that we will be changing the whole way we see unauthorised
expenditure in future, and we, indeed, will be changing the whole way in
which it is processed.

Up to now we have had to rely on this very heavy compliance approach and it
has been very necessary. This, of course, means compliance with vast rules
which govern the spending practices of Government. In fact, this is an
expenditure control system that has been the only tool Government has had
thus far, as it has sought to protect public funds from poor or dishonest
use. As the new Act shifts us from an intense control environment to more
of a performance environment, the rules will greatly reduce. I think the
most obvious effect will be to significantly reduce the instances of
unauthorised expenditure which otherwise arise because of technical reasons
and where the state has in fact suffered no loss, these being those which
are currently classified as unauthorised because, for example, they do not
comply with some nonessential tender board regulation.

If we look at the Bill before us, particularly Schedule 1, there is
actually a very small amount of actual loss to the state, most of it being
there for technical reasons. If we further  consider the total amount which
constitutes  unauthorised expenditure in the current year or immediate past
years, then this is usually less than 0,5% of the full Government spending.
Therefore there is no need for panic, even though there is still need for
some concern. But all this does mean that in future we can expect a far
thinner finance Bill when the new Act comes into being.

I think, contemplating the detail of the lists in the Bill before us, one
will of course notice the odd incident which does demand our special
attention, where an official's actions are simply inexcusable. These
actions need to be fully considered and responded to in order to send out
the right message and to discourage repetition. Hopefully the Joint
Standing Committee on Public Accounts, when investigating and processing
these instances, and making its recommendations to Parliament, will achieve
just that.

I would like to say a word or two about Schedule 3. Other speakers have
also referred to this, the approximately R4 billion of the TBVC countries.
Of course, this arrear is from a particularly difficult time in our
history, and I think one is always going to be left with something of a
question regarding the ease with which this R4 billion has been discounted
and written off. We have 303 instances out of 305 which have been included
in this list, and one always asks the question whether there was perhaps
more that we could have done. However, at the time we had to be satisfied
with the efforts from the provincial level that the records were simply in
a state of disarray and I think they went a long way towards convincing us
that there was very little chance of fully investigating those amounts and
recovering them. However, as I say, it is an opportunity to close the door
on another part of that history which we would like to put behind us, and
for that reason we will certainly support this Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker ...

Mr J H MOMBERG: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: May I just find out -
because of the fact that Mr Lee is sitting with the New NP - whether a
special ruling has been made for crossing the floor between the two
opposition parties?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That is not a point of order. [Interjections.]
Please proceed, hon member.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, the amount of R4,1 billion referred to in
Schedule 3 of the Bill represents the last direct monetary remains of the
apartheid regime in respect of the former homelands and probably reflects
only a fraction of the financial cost of a political ideology that caused
so much human suffering and pain. It closes the book on money spent on the
former homelands and reminds us never to repeat the same mistakes. The R4,1
billion being authorised in this regard equals the R4 billion of unspent
money and funds reported by the Auditor-General during the 1998-99
financial year, representing nearly 5% of that year's total budget. In the
same way that we are critical of money wasted on a political ideology, we
are also critical of wasted opportunities when budgeted funds are not
spent.

We trust that the new Public Finance Management Act will have the effect to
reduce the amount of money over or underspent. This puts a huge
responsibility on the national Treasury, the Auditor-General, Government
departments and this House. The UDM supports the Bill.

Mr L M GREEN: Deputy Speaker, hon members, the clearing of the accounts of
the former TBVC states and self-governing territories has been an
outstanding matter for a very long time. The legislation before the House
today finally deals with this outstanding matter and, when passed today,
will authorise the expenditure of R4,14 billion by the former TBVC states.

Our acceptance of this Bill today will enable the new provincial structures
to clear the relevant book entries. This Bill also gives effect to
resolutions by the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts that R133,8
million of unauthorised Government expenditure, dating back to the early
1990s, be authorised by Parliament. The Bill will further authorise R15,2
million in unauthorised expenditure that had not been transferred to the
Central Revenue Fund. For these reasons, the ACDP therefore supports the
passing of this Bill.

Mr B NAIR: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and members,
the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts had, over the years,
grappled with the problems of unauthorised expenditure, non-adherence by
departments to Treasury instructions, and the tender board rules, of proper
financial management and internal controls, amongst other things. Some
accounting officers have consistently failed to carry out these strictures,
or recommendations that we had made. The latest Auditor-General's report on
national Government deals extensively with the problems of financial
management. The issue that confronts us is how to contain financial
mismanagement.

Now, thankfully - and this has already been mentioned by the previous
speakers - we have the Public Finance Management Act which came into
operation in April, and is in the process of being implemented. High-
powered and well-motivated human resources and equally well-equipped
technology are required for the successful engineering of the Public
Finance Management Act. The Treasury, like Sars, must of necessity be well
equipped, well motivated, efficient and business-oriented. The cost
involved will be high and it will not be surprising if the Treasury demands
greater resources for its enterprise.

Only yesterday the public accounts and finance portfolio committees were
briefed by the Treasury on plans to implement the Public Finance Management
Act. Emphasis is being placed on training of staff, recruitment of
expertise and upgrading of technology so that effective financial
management of revenue and expenditure, and of assets and liabilities, can
be attained. This will mean proper internal audits and controls, monitoring
and reporting, performance budgeting and accountability. Capacity-building
will be intervowen and constitute an ongoing programme. In time, accounting
will change from cash to an accrual system to ensure effective
accountability.

In the past few years, many changes have been made in the management of
public finance. The reorganisation of the South African Revenue Services
and the resultant efficient revenue collection, have brought more money
into the coffers of the state. Now, the reorganisation of the Departments
of Finance and of State Expenditure into a single entity will ensure
effective oversight over departments. Correspondingly, there will be
greater delegation of powers to departments, which will, in turn, have to
ensure proper delivery and accountability to the Treasury.

Given the will of the heads of Government to implement the Public Finance
Management Act, and backed up by sufficient resources, in a few years we
may witness the more efficient financial management of Government.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to thank all of
the members who have participated in the debate for their support for this
Bill. I think a word that one would like to convey is that essentially the
spirit of the Public Finance Management Act is properly captured in the
issues that have been raised here by members. These are the very problems
that we are trying to deal with so that in future South Africa does not
experience the sort of things that we find ourselves having to address in
the Finance Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
                            BANKS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, the Bill that we are debating
today essentially seeks to simplify and improve certain provisions of the
Banks Act, which, in the process of administering the principal Act and
through consultations with foreign supervisory authorities and
international standard-setting bodies such as the Basle Committee on
Banking Supervision, were found to be advisable.

It improves the principal Act - makes it accord more with international
banking standards and best practice as set out in the Basle Core Principles
for Effective Banking Supervision. These core principles are intended to
serve as a basic reference for supervisory and other authorities in all
countries and internationally. Accordingly, the amendments contained in the
Bill are proposed in order to ensure that the South African legal
framework, in terms of which banking institutions and banking groups are
regulated and supervised, remains relevant and current, and in line with
the latest national and international developments and standards.

After a lengthy process of consideration, the Standing Committee for the
Revision of the Banks Act appointed by the Minister of Finance has approved
the envisaged amendments described in the Bill. The committee consists of,
among others, representatives of the banks, the Banking Council, credit
unions, stokvels and the Postbank.

In summary, the amendments that we are effecting through this Bill are to
insert certain new definitions; to provide for the designation by the
Reserve Bank of more than one Deputy Registrar of Banks - this is really
because of growing responsibilities; to provide for the confidential
treatment of the due diligence report drawn up in consequence of conducting
a due diligence audit on the financial condition of a bank; to substitute a
process of review for the existing process of appeal against decisions of
the Registrar of Banks; to empower the Registrar to authorise a banking
institution to use or refer to itself by a name other than the one under
which it is registered; further to consolidate principles of good corporate
governance with regard to the membership of the audit committee of a bank;
to abolish the judicial management of a bank that is in financial
difficulties and instead thereof to render the process of curatorship of
such a bank more comprehensive; to increase the minimum capital and
unimpaired reserve funds required to be maintained by a bank from R50
million to R250 million; and to provide for addition capital and reserve
funds to be maintained by banks in respect of their trading in financial
instruments.

We also provide for the maintenance of an aggregate minimum capital and
reserve funds in respect of a banking group; allow banks greater
flexibility in the utilisation of their liquid assets; introduce further
safeguards in respect of large exposures constituting credit risks to
banking institutions; and, finally, we seek to create and prescribe
penalties for certain further offences.

With these few words, I would like to open this debate on the Banks
Amendment Bill.

Prof B TUROK: Deputy Chairperson, much as we welcome your accession to the
throne, I was hoping that the Deputy Speaker would be here because I have a
point to make which she would have appreciated very much. In the course of
our discussion of this Bill in the Portfolio Committee on Finance, we came
across a formulation that something must happen ``at his own expense''. The
committee said no, we must put ``his or her'', and the law adviser said no,
because the principal Act talks about ``his'' therefore the amending
legislation cannot talk about ``his or her''. And it seems to me that this
is a matter that the House should be aware of, that we are stuck in a
groove of old legislation which is male dominant and cast in the language
of the past. I think some of the hon members here must take it up in the
right place.

This Bill is a rather important one because of the context. The object is
to create greater certainty in institutions which are based on risk. We
often talk about banks as ordinary businesses, forgetting that a bank is
fundamentally a risk institution. They risk capital because they gear money
that one puts into the bank and use that to invest in various places and
this is done in an atmosphere of risk.

Last week I attended a conference in New York of some 2 000 delegates who
were concerned about the state of the world and a great deal of discussion
took place about the financial institutions and the financial regulation of
those institutions worldwide. The conference was held in parallel to the
United Nations Millennium Conference and it was attended by many heads of
state and various leaders of the UN who participated in both meetings. What
came out very strongly was a recognition that current economic uncertainty
internationally is based on a crisis in the banking system.

This Bill of ours is meant to ensure that our own banking system is not
only prudent and well regulated, but that it behaves in accordance with
those requirements that are now recognised internationally. This is
particularly important because of the recent crisis in East Asia, where
there was a contagion effect in the whole economy because the banks had
been lending too much.

Our committee was also cognisant of the fact that in the United States one
of the largest banks, the LTCM, almost went bust because the gearing was
too high. That bank had a certain quantity of money. They lent far more, on
a very high gearing ratio, and therefore created a danger not only to that
bank, but to the whole of the financial system in the United States and
internationally.

One of the issues reflected in this Bill is the complexity of banking
worldwide. We have local banks, we have foreign banks, we have
conglomerates and we have branches. The definitions draw attention to three
different kinds of banking institutions. Firstly, there is a banking group
which is a part of a financial structure which is not involved in banking.
But they are linked and therefore the prudential activities of the banking
branch can have a serious effect on the other parts. Furthermore, this can
affect the financial system irrespective of the domicile of that branch.

We therefore have conglomerates, which are worldwide, in which in one part
there is risk and in another part there is not so much risk, but the one
can infect the other. Then we have a branch of a bank, which is a foreign
institution, which is not a public company, but nevertheless does banking
in South Africa. Thirdly, we have a South African bank which conducts
banking outside South Africa. So we have a huge complexity of relationships
between financial institutions, hence the need for prudential
consideration.

One of the safeguards that were brought in is that tertiary capital is
required in the case of those banks which trade in financial instruments,
because now we have a system worldwide which has instruments called
derivatives, which are very volatile and create enormous hazard in the
financial sectors all over the world. Therefore we want additional
prudential requirements for those institutions.

I should say that the committee was also a bit concerned about a clause in
the original draft which said that people who are summoned by a board of
review are compelled to attend, and the committee felt that, in order to
have a safeguard, that person should have legal representation. However the
Department of Finance insisted that it should be at the individual expense
of the person summoned and that the Department of Finance or the Government
should not have to foot the bill. It is in that clause that the word
``his'' was inserted and we could not get the word ``her'' in, because, in
the cause of gender equity, some will want ``her'' to pay as well. I hope
the female members of the House will forgive that comment.

Finally, there is the question of the R250 million. Many members of our
committee felt that this was too high for a new bank, ie that it would be
prohibitive for a new black bank, for example. We discussed this at length
and the explanation that was given us was that ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired.

Prof B TUROK: Midsentence! Thank you, Chair. [Applause].

Dr G G WOODS: Mr Chairperson, this Bill reinforces and updates the key
premises of the Banks Act and does so as a necessary response to recent
developments in the banking industry. Among these developments are rapid
changes in the banking industry with the formation of new financial-type
collectives. Together with this has been the development of new
marketplaces and the growing use of particular financial instruments. I
think when such developments take place in an industry in which huge
consumer interests are at stake, there is an obligation to revisit the
relevant law and to evaluate its existing appropriateness and potential
effectiveness.

However, firstly, just let us briefly remind ourselves of the key
objectives of the Banks Act against which these amendments should be
considered. Essentially the Act provides a framework of supervision for the
banking aspects of financial services and issues the prudential rules it
expects banks to follow. The prudential rules in significant part relate to
the capital and the liquidity adequacy of banks, or to the capital ratio as
we refer to it. Clause 12 of the Bill, which relates to section 70 of the
Act, seeks to adjust this adequacy level, as mentioned by the hon Ben
Turok, from R50 million to R250 million. I think this is where we expect to
have some problems, or an outcry from the industry, because it is the most
substantial amendment within the Bill. However, pleasingly, the banking
industry, via the Banking Council, saw fit to support that, as they did the
new definition of tertiary capital.

The other noteworthy amendments are those concerning the new treatment of
separate entities which, in fact, constitute a banking group, particulars
of which are adequately described in the Bill. I think the conducting of
more confidential, diligent audits, as mentioned by the Deputy Minister,
the changing of the appeal process to a review process, and the Bill's
additional protections in respect of large credit exposure risks and
foreign banking connections all contribute to the Act's regulatory
objectives, which go towards ensuring a high level of efficiency in the
provision of financial services, and do so in a way which adds further
stability to the entire financial system. I think, in view of these
positive amendments, we support the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, before I call Mr
Rabie, some members are causing me to focus rather sharply on them. I will
not identify who they are, but I hope they do not become the subject of my
total attention.

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairman, hon Deputy Minister, hon members, the Banks
Amendment Bill contains a number of internationally accepted amendments
dealing with issues that relate to the Basle  Committee on Banking
Supervision, and the New NP supports this Bill.

As some of the other speakers have already mentioned, the Expressions
``bank'', ``branch of a bank'' and ``banking group'' are defined. Clause
1(b) stipulates the process of review to be followed if a decision has been
taken by the Registrar of Banks, and some of the relevant banks are not
satisfied with it. Clause 1(c) is also significant as it refers to liquid
assets. The consideration of the credit risk that long-term securities
entail is stressed in this context. Another feature of the Bill is the
repositioning of the definition of primary share capital, which means
capital obtained through the issue of ordinary shares, nonredeemable and
noncumulative preference shares, or prescribed categories of preferred
securities.

Clause 1(f), again, repositions the definition of secondary capital, also
obtained through the issue of cumulative preference shares, ordinary
shares, prescribed categories of debt instruments, and it also defines
unimpaired reserves, which relate to funds obtained from actual earnings,
prescribed percentages, including percentages of the amounts of any surplus
resulting from a revaluation of assets. ``Tertiary capital'' is defined as
``accrued current-period uncapitalised net profits derived from trading
activities''.

Clause 2 provides for more than one Deputy Registrar of Banks, allowing a
maximum of four. It allows for more specialising and it may result in a
flatter report structure. I think this is also a significant improvement in
this particular Bill. Clause 3 provides for the conducting of a due
diligence audit of the financial conditions of a bank in the interests of
the bank under audit, and it is also in the interests of the depositors and
possible future transferees.

At present the banking sector operates in a global economic financial
environment. It is of the utmost importance that the South African banking
sector be allowed to implement clause 5 of the proposed Banks Amendment
Bill to allow the Registrar of Banks to authorise the use of a name other
than the one under which the banking institution is registered, but by
which the institution is generally known and conducts its business.

Clause 8 consolidates the position in respect of the members of a bank's
audit committee. The chairperson of the board of directors may not serve as
a member of the bank's audit committee and this is also in line with
international best practice. Clause 12 amends section 70 of the principal
Act which sets out the minimum capital reserves, as referred to by Prof
Turok. The reserve fund requirements with which banks must comply increases
from R50 million to R250 million. Bearing in mind that other types of
banks, mutual or co-operative banks, can be started with as little as R10
million, it is also considered to be in the interests of the general
public. Clause 15 is significant, because it further safeguards the
interests of banks in respect of large exposures constituting credit risks
to banks, and extends these safeguards to single controlling companies,
local branches of foreign banks and foreign branches of local banks.

Die Suid-Afrikaanse banksektor en finansiële markte het ondanks 'n hoë mate
van turbulensie op die internasionale markte die dekade van die
neëntigerjare baie goed deurstaan. In hierdie verband moet ons beslis
verwys na die banksektor wat 'n leidende rol gespeel het om die Suid-
Afrikaanse finansiële sektor 'n integrale deel van die internasionale
markte te maak, en ek dink die hele ekonomiese groei kan slegs geskied
indien ons hierdie kosbare kleinood van ons bewaar en verder uitbou.

'n Beroep word op alle rolspelers gedoen, insluitende die Regering, om die
banksektor uit te bou. Banke werk met openbare geld en daar is risiko
daaraan verbonde. Die leen van geld is gegrond op 'n baie hoë morele
verantwoordelikheid. Banke het morele verpligtinge ten opsigte van
aandeelhouers rakende dividende, maar dit is ook gebiedend noodsaaklik dat
die banke hul aandeel in die bemagtiging van die agtergeblewe sektor uitbou
sodat hierdie persone en rykdom- en welvaartverspreiding 'n breër
aansluitingsbasis kan vind. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In spite of a high degree of turbulence on international markets, the
South African banking sector and financial markets have weathered the
decade of the nineties very well. In this regard we definitely have to
refer to the banking sector which played a leading role to make the South
African financial sector an integral part of international markets, and I
think that overall economic growth can only occur if we preserve and
further develop this valuable asset.

We appeal to all key players, including the Government, to develop the
banking sector. Banks work with public money and there are risks involved.
The lending of money is based on a very high moral responsibility. Banks
have moral obligations towards shareholders as regards dividends, but it is
also imperative that banks develop their share in the empowering of the
disadvantaged sector, so that these people and the distribution of wealth
and prosperity may find a more general point of connection.]
I studied an article which was published in Business Day on 8 September
2000, page 2, where South Africa's microeconomic environment is analysed by
a well-known professor attached to the Harvard Business School, by the name
of Michael Potter. He says that South Africa has an outstanding asset in
the macroeconomic front and he refers to the banking sector. He also says
that our particular banking sector is extremely sophisticated, and that it
allows us to compete internationally. In fact, he refers to our competitive
edge. He ranks South Africa 13th in this regard.

However, we should not be complacent because some of the other sectors are
anything but sophisticated. For example, our police protection is ranked
third from the bottom. Only three other countries - Mexico, Venezuela and
Ecuador - are regarded as higher risk than ours. I think this is a serious
constraint, and we should really give our undivided attention to that. The
positive news, however, is that South Africa is ranked 25th out of 58
countries in the macroeconomic area, but only 33rd in areas such as
economic growth.

The banking sector is an integral and indispensable component for future
South African growth. Potter says that South Africa and Turkey exhibit an
unusual combination of ``sophistication in a developing economy. We will
have to continue to cope with the unusual political changes which may
inhibit or improve our competitive economic competitiveness.

Ons kan baie praat oor die banksektor. Laat ons hom nie die swartskaap maak
nie. Laat ons hom as een van die kroonjuwele van ons ekonomiese sektor
beskou en hom verder uitbou. [Applous.] [We can say a lot about the banking
sector. Let us not make it the black sheep. Let us view it as one of the
crown jewels of our economic sector and develop it further. [Applause.]]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Chairperson, we welcome the long-overdue amendments to
this Bill. Both the introduction of a new definition of a banking group and
the high amount of the minimum capital requirement now bring South Africa
in line with the generally accepted international banking norms generally
referred to as the Basle principles. This makes it possible for the Office
for Banks to conduct supervision of financial conglomerates of which one or
more banks are members.
I notice that the Deputy Minister of Finance is in the House. Therefore,
allow me to make an observation about the role of our formal banks and
economic transformation. It is clear that there is a lack of progress and,
seemingly, no sense of urgency in this regard. We therefore appeal to the
Minister of Finance to alter the existing Government levy on all banking
transactions to a low ad valorem rate of 0,05%. We estimate that this
should generate an additional revenue of at least R10 billion per annum,
which could be used effectively to enhance black economic empowerment, and
thereby accelerate economic transformation in our country. The UDM supports
the Banks Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Mr Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members, the Banks
Amendment Bill raises the aggregate minimum amount of capital and the
reserve funds to be maintained from the R50 million which was laid down six
years ago - that is a long time in monetary terms - to R250 million. We
believe that this increase will not be harmful to small banks. I think that
that was the argument during the debate in the portfolio committee. This
increase has been necessitated by the growth in inflation, the expansion of
the banks' activities and the need to enable local banks to remain
competitive in a globalised market.
The Bill also provides for additional capital to be kept by banks that
participate in financial instruments trade. It introduces a new provision
that requires the separate entities that constitute a banking group also to
maintain an aggregate of minimum capital and reserve funds. Another
amendment will allow banks the flexibility to use their liquid assets for
purposes of intraday accommodation at the Reserve Bank discount window. We
also welcome the fact that a process of peer review will replace the
current process of appealing against the decisions of the Registrar of
Banks.

These amendments are necessary, and they are needed. Therefore, the ACDP
has no difficulty in supporting the Bill.

Mr M S BOOI: Mr Chairperson, after long deliberations by the portfolio
committee and looking into the principal Act preceding this one, the ANC
has agreed on this Bill and is supporting it.

However, there were a few issues that were raised by the Bank Adjudicator
which were quite important. The first point was the consideration of
transparency - and how transparent appointments were going to be. To us,
those were quite relevant and important issues which we applied our minds
to. We said that we would have to continuously encourage and make sure that
the Minister ensures that transparency does take place.

The second point was the issue of legal representation of those who are
going to be called by the Registrar during tough times when they face
liquidation. So, it would be very important that they have some legal
representation. Without legal representation they might feel they are being
interrogated, because of the wording used in the Bill. We thought that it
would be quite sensible and reasonable for us to encourage them and allow
in the legislation for them to have some legal representation.

I do not think that the issue of R250 million, as reflected, has to be
viewed as something impacting on small industries or small, medium and
micro enterprises, but it should rather be viewed as something that will
assist us to assist the banking community to build some viability and more
confidence. It is very important, within the South African and world
context, as well as in the politics of globalisation, that we ensure that
we have entry that is quite sound and acceptable within the norms of
business in the banking community.

So the R250 million, from our point of view, is quite acceptable and we
think that it will not impair the small banking community or the small,
medium and micro enterprises from having a chance of getting in. Comrade
Ben Turok has already indicated that, although the principal Act was
adopted only in 1995, it has had a huge impact on the issue of gender
sensitivity, which we have raised. We also hope that there will be quite a
lot of improvement in how they look at that particular issue.

Relating to one of the last issues that was raised, clause 70A really
defines what banks have to do as different groupings, that is, what do they
have to do when they are aligned as a bank with different groups, how do
they address that type of relationship, and how do we see the impact when
the Registrar looks into this. Does the Registrar have to ensure that they
are included, or are the people that are included in the banking community
being treated in isolation?

We have always been saying that these issues are quite important in the
banking community, and that whenever there is a bank that is involved with
that particular community, the issue of risk which goes with banking is one
that we always have to ensure we can counter. We should not just ensure
that the risk is taken away by just being moralistic, or by just saying
that the issues will not impact on the economy of the country. Therefore,
we are saying that the banking community, in relation to that banking
group, will always have to ensure that it takes responsibility in relation
to the banking group, and that it does do so. So, what I am saying is that
we support the Bill, and we go along with it. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairman, again, one would like to thank
all the members who have participated in the debate. Clearly, we are not
being controversial today because I think all the parties are supporting
the Bill that we have placed before this House.

Regarding an issue that was raised by the hon Koornhof, I am not quite sure
that I fully understood the proposal that he was tabling. However, I think
the issue that he seeks to address is an issue which is occupying our minds
currently. If one were to go even by the approach that has been taken by
the Black Economic Empowerment Commission in the report that they outlined
to Parliament yesterday, I think that there is an important message that is
coming out of that, that we do need a more comprehensive approach but also
an approach that seeks to bring in various players in trying to deal with
this particular problem.

I think that the issue of investment for growth is an important one because
it makes that point, which is: let us come together and focus on the
question of growth and come to some agreement as to what to do. We will
have an opportunity once the final report has been tabled to have more
focused and more comprehensive discussions around the question of black
empowerment. But, clearly, it remains a critical challenge that faces South
Africa.

With those few words I would like to thank all those members who have
participated. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The Bill will be referred to the NCOP
for concurrence. Hon members, because of your kind co-operation, I am once
again delighted to be able to conclude the business of this day early. The
House is adjourned.

The House adjourned at 17:03.

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson:


     (1)    The Minister of Sport and Recreation on 4 September 2000
         submitted a draft of the South African Sports Commission Amendment
         Bill, 2000, as well as the memorandum explaining the objects of
         the proposed legislation, to the Speaker and the Chairperson in

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on SMME
     sector, dated 31 August 2000:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, having held public
     hearings on the promotion of the SMME (small, medium and micro
     enterprise) sector and the role of banks, reports as follows:

     The Committee and the Select Committee on Economic Affairs of the
     National Council of Provinces held the public hearings on 14 and 21
     June 2000. The immediate background to the hearings was a workshop on
     SMME promotion, organised by the NCOP, where it was reiterated that
     access to finance was a critical issue and new initiatives were called
     for in relation to banks.

     The objective of the hearings was to examine the extent of the
     involvement of banks in SMME finance and problems encountered in this
     regard, as well as proposals to increase access to finance by SMMEs.
     The hearings attracted a good deal of public attention. Many
     individuals wrote to the Committee with specific complaints, and many
     significant stakeholders gave oral evidence. The hearings were intended
     to contribute to a positive way forward and to highlight the work still
     to be done.


     A.     Banking Council and Associated Banks (Absa, Nedcor, Standard
         Bank)


         The Council began by highlighting a number of steps they had taken
         since the Committee's 1999 hearings on bank charges and micro-
         finance. These included the introduction of a new Code of Banking
         Conduct, appointment of an Adjudicator independent of the Council,
         the establishment of a community-based financial institution,
         Sizanani, and the recent discussions with Khula around the
         provision of venture capital.

         The Council pointed to a structural tension between their
         involvement in economic transformation and the maintenance of a
         "sound financial sector". It acknowledges that there is a need for
         economic restructuring, including the drawing of historically
         disadvantaged people into the formal economy, income
         redistribution and addressing problems created by low levels of
         capital accumulation and entrepreneurial skills.

         This needed to be balanced against the need to maintain a sound
         financial sector in line with international best practice.
         According to the Council, the unfolding international environment
         is creating new competitive pressures, thereby placing certain
         constraints on the banking industry in South Africa. These include
         pressures to eliminate cross-subsidisation and to scale down less
         profitable activities.

         The Council presented a profile of the SMME sector in relation to
         the cost and size of loans. It argued that the unit costs of
         making loans to micro-enterprises were too high for banks, which
         could also not provide the support needed for entrepreneurs with
         limited managerial skills. They said banks could only become
         involved in financing very small businesses through specialised
         institutions such as Sizanani. The banks are, however, currently
         very much involved in servicing the small and medium enterprise
         sector and could expect to continue to be involved in this segment
         of the market.

         Absa, Nedcor and Standard Bank provided a profile of their
         individual institutions, mission statements, total loan book and
         some indication of their involvement in the SME sector. It was
         apparent that the three institutions were using different
         criteria, and from the information presented it was difficult, if
         not impossible, to determine what percentage of the loan book was
         going to black entrepreneurs. Indeed, some of the banks themselves
         acknowledged that they had no real basis for measuring which of
         their clients were previously disadvantaged individuals.

         The Council proposed the establishment of community-based
         financial institutions to service the micro and very small
         sectors, which it said the banks could not finance. The Council
         also proposed the strengthening of the NGO and retail finance
         intermediary sectors that are currently involved in this function.
         The Council also proposed the strengthening of the Sizanani
         project. No clear answers were provided to repeated questions
         about banks' engagement in "red-lining" practices.


     B.     Business Association, Investment Group, Financial Consultancy


         1. South Cape Investment Network


              The presenter referred to the constraints imposed upon smaller
              enterprises by banks. The Network proposed that black-owned
              and -controlled small businesses face more challenges than
              those owned by their white counterparts. A case study was
              presented of a bank manager who refused to open a cheque
              account for an empowerment group.

              It was reported that black entrepreneurs continue to face
              hostility from white bank managers, who are unsympathetic to
              the experience and plight of black-owned small enterprises.
              The Network, in collaboration with other stakeholders in the
              Southern Cape, has taken up the issue of racism in the
              financial sector to the Human Rights Commission. Some of the
              issues raised included staff and management attitudes, red-
              lining and a general disregard for the South African context.


         2. Western Cape Black Business and Professionals Alliance


              The Alliance comprises several institutions operating
              throughout the country, and consists of accountants, building
              contractors, lawyers and the Black Management Forum. According
              to them, a key challenge is the changing of an existing
              mindset in the banking industry that sees black business as
              representing a high risk. Banks are doing very little to
              provide start-up capital, guarantees and bridging finance for
              small black business.

              The Alliance focused its submission on the construction
              industry. Three areas were addressed: Provision of bank
              guarantees, access to bridging finance and bank credit ratings
              of construction companies. Black contractors are currently
              receiving construction tenders through government procurement
              processes, but are unable to source funds from the relevant
              financial institutions. The Alliance reported that their
              members are then forced to either forfeit the contract or
              enter into a joint venture with a white company. According to
              the Alliance, this trend does not contribute to economic
              empowerment.

              Similarly, access to bridging finance, credit ratings and
              financing of commercial property in black areas are barriers
              to emerging small entrepreneurs. A construction tender
              requires bridging finance and a credit rating from a financial
              institution. Banks have given several negative ratings to
              members of the Alliance. They said that these problems are not
              confined to micro and very small enterprises. They said that
              small and medium established black-owned businesses (not just
              start-ups) were encountering such problems.


         3. EYETHU Butchery


              The presenter, the owner of several properties and businesses
              employing more than 40 people, is an established entrepreneur
              with a proven track record. She has been a customer of
              Standard Bank for the past 19 years. She characterises her
              relationship with the bank as a "hands off" relationship that
              has not contributed to her success or business growth. It was
              reported that the local bank manager does not have a "passion"
              or commitment to the development of SMMEs.

              Bureaucratic requirements, imposed by the bank, have slowed
              down the growth of her business. Several of her (white)
              competitors have developed more co-operative relationships
              with the bank manager and are receiving preferential terms
              from the bank. Access to working capital is often restricted
              due to stringent collateral requirements. It was reported that
              when collateral is provided, banks are still hesitant to
              provide access to finance. This impacts negatively on the cash-
              flow and stock levels of the business, which in turn
              influences the growth of the business.


         4. Citizens Finance, Financial and Business Consulting


              The presenter highlighted the important role of banks in
              contributing towards the economic growth of the South African
              economy. Previous government policies were not supportive of
              SMME development, especially black-owned SMMEs. It is
              estimated that black entrepreneurs received less than 2% of
              the total bank credit under the previous government. It was
              argued that the policy of banks has not changed in respect of
              SMME finance.

              Banks look more favourably to financing empowerment deals that
              involve mergers and acquisitions. Banks view SMMEs as a high
              risk, but poor performance of SMMEs is due to underdeveloped
              entrepreneurial skill, which in turn requires access to
              finance. There is no history of an understanding between banks
              and black communities. The government has begun addressing
              several of these challenges through the SMME strategy. The
              effectiveness of the strategy needs to be evaluated.

              Banks, in turn, have also introduced several measures,
              including the Community Bank, that was recently closed down.
              Banks have also established the SMME desks and the Sizanani
              project. It was suggested that the government had
              overestimated the role of banks in advancing the SMME sector.
              In general, government policies have been correct, but the
              implementation has been more difficult than envisaged. As part
              of a way forward, the presenter proposed that SMME policies be
              targeted and focused. The existing economic structure needs to
              be changed. This is a long-term objective.

              Banks must find new and creative ways of providing access to
              finance. The SMME sector must be made less risky. More
              training must be provided. The government must increase
              funding to SMME programmes and actively support business
              associations. It was suggested that consultation between banks
              and the government needs to be strengthened to provide
              targeted financial services. The presenter concluded by
              proposing an improved communication between banks and the
              government so as to establish a dynamic relationship.


         5. Diakonia Council of Churches (DCC)


              The objective of the DCC is to contribute to peace,
              development and a better quality of life for the people of the
              greater Durban. Individual congregations have expressed
              concern over the increasing unemployment and poverty in the
              region. The DCC is a result of a response to the local
              situation. A project of the DCC includes life skills and
              technical and small business training. In the past four years,
               over 1 500 people have been trained in a range of skills such
              as sewing, electrical installation, carpentry, construction
              and motor mechanics. The presenter highlighted that the idea
              of skills training is to generate "job creators" rather than
              job seekers.

              Several case studies were provided, which emphasised the
              importance of access to finance in creating a culture of
              entrepreneurship, facilitating employment and providing income
              to large numbers of vulnerable people. Several barriers to
              micro enterprise development were identified: Banks exclude
              micro entrepreneurs on the basis that a minimum amount must be
              maintained in a bank account; banks open accounts for people
              with permanent jobs only; and banks levy excessive
              administrative costs and conditions. The micro and very small
              enterprise sector is an important income generator for a vast
              number of people.

              The DCC proposed a change in the banking "mindset" on risk and
              economic growth. It also proposed the removal of collateral
              requirements for certain loans in the micro and very small
              enterprise sector, no minimum amount for loans, that interest
              be charged at market rates and that loans not be linked to
              savings. The DCC also called for improved sensitivity of bank
              staff in local branches.


         6. National African Federation Chamber of Commerce (Nafcoc)
               
              The submission focused on the failure to accord organisations
              like Nafcoc a more prominent role in the SMME programme, the
              demographic make-up of staff in the Department of Trade and
              Industry responsible for the SMME programme, and the slow pace
              of land reform, as constraints faced by black entrepreneurs.
              Nothing specific was said about banks and access to finance by
              SMMEs.


     C.     SA Reserve Bank: Bank Supervision Department (BSD)


         The presentation highlighted the importance of banking and the
         significance of a sound, credible financial environment for
         economic growth. The Banks Act of 1990 provided for "prudential
         regulation and risk management" of financial institutions. This
         Act, reflecting a number of concerns of the time, focused on the
         regulation of deposit-taking institutions and prohibited non-
         registered entities from accepting deposits. The BSD's main
         function is to protect depositors and maintain sound credit
         standards. The presenter stressed the importance of a sound
         credible financial system, and called for circumspection when
         addressing structural challenges.

         It was reported that over the years a number of initiatives had
         been taken to address constraints experienced by "unbanked
         people". These included the passage of the Mutual Banks Act, the
         promotion of community banking, stokvels, savings co-operatives,
         village financial service co-operatives, the launch of the
         Mortgage Indemnity Scheme and consultations with stakeholders
         about alternative strategies to informal financing and micro-
         lending.
         There have also been moves to establish an effective regulatory
         environment for the micro-lending industry through the Micro-
         Finance Regulatory Council. It is possible that this Council will
         facilitate the accepting of deposits by micro-finance
         institutions. It was reported that FinaSol and the Financial
         Services Association have been appointed as regulatory bodies for
         the village financial service co-operatives. All of these
         initiatives have more or less operated on the basis of exemption
         from the Banks Act.

         The presenters expressed the view that what was needed in the
         medium to long term was to facilitate the emergence of new
         institutions that might be more effective than banks in financing
         SMMEs. They argued strongly that the government should not force
         banks to lend to SMMEs, the so-called stick method. They felt that
         greater success might be achieved by increasing competition in the
         market. This might be achieved by encouraging the emergence of a
         securities market as an instrument for accessing finance. Various
         co-operative ventures could also be encouraged. The success of
         this strategy will largely depend on the availability of financial
         information.

         It was reported that the Reserve Bank, due to improper practices
         encountered by various institutions in the past, had expanded the
         definition of a deposit-taker. This placed certain restrictions on
         the emergence of what may be more appropriate financial
         institutions. What was required, was a streamlining and refocusing
         of legislation, including the Banks Act, the Companies Act, the
         draft Collective Investments Schemes Bill and the draft
         Investments Services Bill, to overcome current legislative
         restrictions that make it impossible to access the securities
         market for SMME finance. Redefining deposit-takers in conjunction
         with the fine-tuning of the above legislation was called for as
         part of a strategy to promote competition between financial
         instruments. The presenters also supported greater compulsory
         disclosure by financial institutions of their involvement in
         community-based activities, including provision of finance to
         SMMEs.


     D.     Government


         1. Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Chief Directorate:
              Business Regulation and Consumer Services, and Khula
              Enterprise Finance


              The DTI highlighted the importance of the SMME sector as a
              means of poverty alleviation, a vehicle for black economic
              empowerment, in increasing competition and promoting job
              creation. The many barriers to SMME development were re-
              emphasised.

              The National Enterprise Survey, commissioned by The Presidency
              with the support of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, had
              reported that black-owned firms found it more difficult to
              access finance than their white counterparts. The same survey
              found that while access to finance was not a major problem for
              South African companies in general, it was for black-owned
              SMMEs. These problems were particularly acute for recently
              established enterprises, i.e. those that are three years and
              younger.
              The survey highlighted the following problems experienced by
              SMMEs in accessing finance: A lack of collateral and equity
              finance, effectiveness of affirmative procurement, perception
              of risk, failure rate of start-ups, management support
              systems, high costs of operating SMMEs, and the adequacy of
              credit guarantees. The survey also found that there were
              relationship problems between bank managers and black
              entrepreneurs, regulatory inconsistencies, problems with high
              interest rates, the Usury Act, the Credit Agreement Act, a
              lack of second-tier institutions and tax incentives.

              Structural and institutional challenges require sustainable
              interventions at several levels. As with other stakeholders,
              banks have a crucial role to play in the formation of capital
              in the economy. The DTI recognised the global constraints
              experienced by banks in South Africa, and argued for an
              approach which balanced the need for sound banking practice
              against the imperative to extend services to people excluded
              from financial services. The growth of the micro-lending
              sector had exposed the slow responsiveness of South African
              banks in entering profitable markets.

              The government will continue to encourage banks to improve
              access to finance for disadvantaged communities and also to
              promote alternative financial institutions. It was noted that
              it was becoming increasingly difficult to measure the extent
              of credit extension to SMMEs due to definitional
              inconsistencies, but studies have agreed that overall bank
              credit extension was low. Another key challenge facing the
              government was to work to improve banking practices in
              relation to black entrepreneurs. It was noted that SMMEs
              complained of continued discrimination and blacklisting.

              The presenter highlighted that banks were crucial to any SMME
              strategy as a result of their outreach, capital base, product
              and expertise. Lack of competition in the banking sector
              remained a fundamental problem. The DTI supported the
              promotion of the micro-lending and credit union sectors as
              alternative instruments, as well as the easing of regulations
              to allow smaller banks to establish themselves. It was
              reported that the DTI, in consultation with other departments,
              was looking into the implementation of a disclosure
              requirement mechanism. The presenter cautioned against simply
              importing a US-based Community Reinvestment Act, given the
              different structural model of US banking. There was, however,
              support for compulsory disclosure of the type contained within
              this type of legislation as a step towards financial reform.
              The low level of bank utilisation of the Khula Guarantee
              Scheme was also highlighted as a concern, and the DTI is at
              present monitoring the unfolding scenario in this regard. The
              participation of a range of stakeholders in developing a
              strategy to address the many challenges facing the SMME sector
              in accessing finance was supported.


     D.     Conclusion and recommendations
         Improving access to finance for black-owned SMMEs is agreed by
         virtually everyone to be a major priority of economic policy.

         The hearings identified a number of "structural" and
         "relationship" challenges that will have to be addressed in making
         this priority policy objective a reality.

         Structural issues include transforming the present financial
         architecture to make it more appropriate to current priorities.
         This was argued particularly in the submission of the SARB. A
         number of scams in the 1980s led to the introduction of strict
         controls over deposit-taking institutions, which, while still
         warranted in many respects, tended to limit the emergence of other
         financial institutions. Alternative institutions today are still
         largely operating on the basis of exemptions from the Banks Act or
         Usury Act, rather than according to their own purpose-built
         regulatory framework. The Committee agrees with the SARB that
         there is an urgent need for a systematic and inclusive review of
         the broad legislative and regulatory framework of financial
         institutions with a view to devising strategies to encourage the
         emergence of a range of institutions that might serve this segment
         of the market.

         At this time, the Committee is of the view that the banks need to
         play a more active role than they have to date. The banks
         themselves agreed that provision of finance to small and medium
         businesses was very much an activity they needed to engage in, and
         that by co-operating in specialist divisions like Sizanani, they
         could serve the "very small" sector as well. The only real debate,
         even according to the banks themselves, was over whether, and how,
         they could be involved in serving the micro sector.


         The Banking Council suggested that the costs of finance, as well
         as being linked to the size of an enterprise, was also a function
         of the degree of access to collateral and the level of managerial
         skill. The Committee proposes the exploration of creative
         partnerships to address such constraints, to deal with the
         perception of risk and co-operate in the promotion of alternative
         financial institutions. Organisations like the Industrial
         Development Corporation are already playing a crucial role in the
         provision of finance, and need to be more actively drawn into the
         strategy.

         Mentoring is generally agreed to be a major challenge, both to
         transfer skills and as a mechanism for reducing risk. Focused and
         targeted training linked to loan applications is clearly required.
         Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency has already launched several
         mentoring programmes. Banks need to be engaged, both on ways they
         can contribute to improving the efficiency of such programmes and
         on how they can be validated in the process of loan applications.

         The system of payment of government contracts also needs review,
         particularly as it impacts on SMMEs. The Committee is aware that
         the Public Finance Management Act should lead to ending the
         practice of long delays in payment for work completed. However,
         the question of finance for the period between the award of a
         tender and completion of a contract needs attention. Black
         business people complain that banks are currently not providing
         bridging finance for SMMEs that have been awarded tenders. Being
         awarded a tender, coupled with a proven ability to perform,
         should, in the Committee's view, be regarded as a form of
         collateral by banks. Relevant procurement authorities and banks
         should explore this issue.

         In addition to structural issues, there are clearly also a number
         of relationship problems. There are too many black-owned small
         businesses who complain that attitudes to banks are less than
         positive and who feel that relationships are "at arms length", for
         this dimension to be ignored. Entrepreneurs complain of an
         alienating and unsympathetic environment, and there is a clear
         perception that black businesses are viewed less favourably than
         white.

         The Committee draws attention to the fact that banks could face
         litigation under equality law if they engage in discriminatory
         practices, including "red-lining", which many say continue to be
         prevalent. Equality law also obliges banks and other institutions
         to establish proactive measures to combat the effects of
         discrimination, particularly in relation to race, gender and
         disability. The Banking Council, in its submission, also drew
         attention to equality law and, in fact, invited aggrieved parties
         to use this remedy to deal with any discriminatory bank practices.
         Beyond this, the Committees believes that banks need to urgently
         review what the SARB called the "politeness factor", and develop a
         more positive attitude towards SMMEs. Steps need to be taken to
         ensure that decisions taken by top management in this regard are
         translated into meaningful change at the level of local managers
         and officials.

         Furthermore, in the Committee's view, there is an urgent need for
         a uniform system of disclosure that will allow the performance of
         particular institutions in providing SMME finance and other
         national priority activities to be measured and compared to the
         performance of other institutions. The Committee is of the view
         that this will require legislative and regulatory intervention.
         There was, in fact, virtual unanimity amongst presenters that
         uniform disclosure requirements allowing for such measurement were
         necessary. While the US Community Reinvestment Act was developed
         in a specific context, different in significant respects from our
         own, a broader discussion of the type of legislation that is
         appropriate to specific South African conditions needs to be
         encouraged.

         The Committee noted that only one national black business
         organisation representing SMME interests participated in the
         hearings. Members of the Committee expressed disappointment that
         the Nafcoc presentation offered little insight on the issues under
         review, which the National Enterprise Survey identified as major
         constraints. Black business needs an organised leadership to
         champion their cause and lobby and negotiate in a more favourable
         climate. The Committee hopes that organised business in general,
         and black organised business in particular, will in future be more
         proactive in presenting proposals to deal with the many
         constraints that black small entrepreneurs face.

         The Committee would like to thank all those who participated in
         the hearings and endorsed the continued engagement between the
         government, organised business, black business and banks.
