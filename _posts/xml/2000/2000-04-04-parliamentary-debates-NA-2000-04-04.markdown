                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms F HAJAIG: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) noting with concern the developments in Zimbabwe;


  (2) reaffirming our close relationship with our neighbouring state;


  (3) respecting the sovereign integrity of the Zimbabwean nation; and


  (4) noting that the wellbeing of our countries is dependent on
       peace,prosperity and democracy within each others' borders,


calls on the government and people of Zimbabwe to respect the rule of law,
the independence of the judiciary and the constitutional framework of that
country and to seek creative, democratic and just means to solve the crisis
that the country faces.

[Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House, noting that -


  (1) the violent suppression by Zanu-PF supporters and police of lawful
       protest against land invasions is a further violation of the rule of
       law in Zimbabwe;


  (2) President Mugabe is implicated in this outrage by his condonation of
       violence against anyone who resists land invasions; and


  (3) this breach of the rule of law in Zimbabwe violates article 4 of the
       SADC Founding Treaty of 1992,


  calls on the Government and the people of South Africa to speak out
  against the escalating violation of human rights and democracy in
  Zimbabwe, and further calls on President Mbeki to communicate with
  President Mugabe as a matter of urgency -


       (a)  condemning the land invasions;


       (b)  emphasising that President Mugabe's failure to uphold the rule
           of law in Zimbabwe not only violates a basis for SADC co-
           operation, but seriously undermines the prospect of an African
           renaissance; and


       (c)  urging a commitment to genuine free and fair elections, and
           offering South African assistance to monitor them.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I shall move:


  That, whereas pride of place is given to the independence, integrity and
  viability of the system of justice in every respected and cherished
  democracy and our judiciary is a cornerstone of our own democracy, the
  House -


  (1) learns with sadness that informed commentators are pointing out many
       shortcomings within the justice system which, because they have not
       been quickly and adequately addressed, are impacting negatively on
       the workings of the justice system; and


  (2) calls on the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development to
       take the bull by the horns and to deal with grievances and
       shortcomings so that our courts function at an optimal level and all
       personnel feel that the system is working adequately and efficiently.

Mrs M M MALUMISE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House, noting that the international drug manufacturer Pfizer
  has offered to provide one of its products, Diflucan, which currently
  costs more than R60 a dose, free of charge in South Africa to Aids
  patients for the control of fungal infections -


  (1) commends Pfizer for its progressive approach; and


  (2) calls on other drug companies that manufacture drugs for the
       treatment  of patients with HIV/Aids to follow the example of Pfizer.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes that a media debate is taking place concerning the President's
       contact with so-called Aids dissidents;


  (2) accepts the right of the President and the Minister of Health to have
       discussions and contact with whomever they please; and


  (3) in view of the negative speculation and the possible effect it might
       have on the World Aids Congress in Durban scheduled for later this
       year,      calls on the President and the Minister of Health to
       inform the House unambiguously of the future role that the so-called
       Aids dissidents will or will not play in the Government's anti-Aids
       initiative in the future.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of
the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the reported statements by Cosatu's secretary-general over the
       weekend that South Africa's jobless masses are getting edgy about the
       pace of efforts by business and Government to create new jobs and
       save existing ones;


  (2) expresses agreement with Mr Vavi's assertion that ``the unemployment
       situation in the country has reached catastrophic levels'';


  (3) nonetheless condemns the reported determination of Cosatu to proceed
       with a national strike in May;


  (4) reiterates the conviction that a national strike during the current
       unemployment crisis can only impact negatively on the livelihoods of
       workers by bringing a part of the economy to a standstill for a whole
       day and further alienating investors, not to mention a further ill-
       afforded drop in productivity; and


  (5) calls on Government urgently to develop a strategy to address the
       unemployment crisis in South Africa, in which the UDM's proposals for
       job creation should be considered.
Mr D S MAIMANE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that a Pietersburg garage owner may face a charge of assault
       after allegedly forcing a worker to eat dog faeces;


  (2) deplores this alleged inhumane treatment and abuse of power;


  (3) calls on the Northern Province police to pursue the matter with the
       full force of the law; and


  (4) offers its support to the victim.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of
the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that South Africa's income distribution is now the most unequal
       in the world;


  (2) notes that South Africa's Gini coefficient, now measuring 0,69, is
       higher than that of Brazil, which formerly topped world charts;


  (3) also notes that the gap between the rich and the poor has widened
       among      poor households, who have experienced a decline of 20% in
       their      incomes and their standard of living;


  (4) acknowledges that there is no doubt that the current economic-
       oriented policy is anti-poor and is creating massive unemployment;
       and


  (5) notes that the PAC reiterates that this country's social, economic
       and political problems can never be solved by moving wealth from the
       poor to the rich.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die AEB sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -
  (1) met sorg kennis neem van die jongste vergrype van die Mugabe-bewind
       in Zimbabwe, naamlik die totale verontagsaming van 'n bevel van die
       Hooggeregshof, die skending van die reg op uitdrukking van sy burgers
       en die eensydige steun van die Zimbabwiese polisiemag aan
       wetsverbrekers;


  (2) meen dat hierdie optrede die totale subkontinent in diskrediet bring;


  (3) erken dat die gebeure in Zimbabwe 'n direk negatiewe invloed op Suid-
       Afrika het, waarvan die jongste daling van die rand 'n sprekende
       bewys is;


  (4) glo dat daar na Suid-Afrika as die toonaangewende land in die SAOG-
       groep opgesien word om duidelik standpunt in te neem en leiding te
       gee in di√© verband;


  (5) meen dat die onwilligheid van die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering om bloot
       'n woord van kritiek teen mnr Mugabe uit te spreek, ons eie land
       ernstig skade berokken; en


  (6) meen dat die optrede van mnr Mugabe en die reaksie van die Suid-
       Afrikaanse Regering die bona fides van die strewe na 'n Afrika-
       renaissance ernstig in diskrediet bring.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the AEB:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with concern the latest infringements of the Mugabe regime in
       Zimbabwe, namely the total disregard of a Supreme Court order, the
       violation of the right of expression of its citizens and the
       unilateral support of the Zimbabwean police force for law-breakers;


  (2) is of the opinion that this action brings the entire subcontinent
       into disrepute;


  (3) recognises that the events in Zimbabwe have a direct, negative effect
       on   South Africa, of which the latest drop in the value of the rand
       is conclusive proof;


  (4) believes that South Africa is looked up to as the leading country in
       the  SADC group to adopt a clear position and show leadership in this
       regard;


  (5) is of the opinion that the unwillingness of the South African
       Government merely to express a word of criticism about Mr Mugabe is
       doing our  own county serious harm; and


  (6) is of the opinion that the actions of Mr Mugabe and the reaction of
       the South African Government are bringing the bona fides of the
       pursuit of an African renaissance into serious disrepute.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) noting the threatened boycott of the 13th International Aids
       Conference to be held in Durban this year by internationally renowned
       scientists working in the field of Aids research;


  (2) recognising that this boycott is the result of the Government's
       continued support for discredited Aids sceptics, which has manifested
       itself, inter alia,in the inclusion of Aids sceptics on an Aids task
       team and the extension     of invitations to Aids sceptics to attend
       the conference; and


  (3) acknowledging that the DP has repeatedly warned the Government of the
       possibility of international isolation if it persists with this
       approach,


  calls on the Government to -


       (a)  accept the internationally accepted medical findings that HIV
           causes Aids; and


       (b)  do everything in its power to fight the HIV/Aids pandemic in
           South Africa.

[Applause.]

Dr K RAJOO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) mourns the passing away of 13 innocent students in a Chatsworth
       nightclub;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  nightclubs where liquor is freely purveyed should not admit
           young students;


       (b)  nightclubs should be strictly regulated and under-age people
           should not be allowed to enter;


       (c)  severe punishment should be meted out to the culprits who were
           responsible for throwing a teargas canister into the overcrowded
           nightclub, resulting in a deadly aftermath; and


       (d)  the horrendous and senseless deaths of young schoolchildren must
           never be repeated; and


  (3) calls on all authorities - the police, education, licensing, fire and
       health departments - closely to monitor any place which allows large
       numbers of people in order to check for under-age people, drugs and
       weapons of any sort.

Mr R P ZONDO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the report that the rate of prosecutions for motor vehicle
       hijackings in Gauteng has increased from 5% to 45%;


  (2) believes that this is an indication of our Government's commitment to
       and success in fighting crime and its new emphasis on prosecution-
       based investigation;


  (3) commends the Police Service, the Office of the National Director of
       Public Prosecutions, the special investigative units and the
       Ministers of the peace and security cluster for their dedication and
       commitment; and


  (4) looks forward to an ongoing increase in the success rate in curbing
       criminality in our country.

[Applause.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met ontsteltenis kennis neem van die jongste twee gevalle van
       plaasmoorde in Mpumalanga en KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) sy innige meegevoel teenoor die familie en naasbestaandes betuig;


  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat plaasmoorde steeds onrusbarend toeneem, in
       teenstelling met 'n andersins dalende moordsyfer; en


  (4) daarvan kennis neem dat dit onwaarskynlik is dat roof die enigste of
       hoofmotief is, veral in die lig van plaasmoordtendense oor 'n tydperk
       heen; en


  (5) die President van Suid-Afrika versoek om 'n kommissie van ondersoek
       in te stel na plaasmoorde en geweld op plase.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the most recent two instances of farm murders in
       Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) expresses its heartfelt condolences to the family and next of kin;


  (3) notes that farm murders are still alarmingly on the increase, in
       contrast with an otherwise declining murder rate;
  (4) notes that theft is unlikely to be the only or the main motive,
       especially in the light of farm murder trends over a period of time;
       and


  (5) requests the President of South Africa to appoint a commission of
       inquiry into farm murders and violence on farms.]

Mr S NAIDOO: Madam Speaker, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) condemns the call by Deputy President Jacob Zuma on the ICFTU to
       lower prices of anti-Aids drugs;


  (2) recognises that the lowering of prices in order for drugs to be
       affordable, especially for poor people, is a commendable idea;


  (3) nonetheless notes that it remains Government's responsibility to
       assist in the fight against Aids and not to question the prices of
       drugs or the link between HIV and Aids; and
  (4) commends the offer of free treatment by Pfizer to help the poor.

Mr T M GONIWE: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the DP has embarked on what Business Day describes as ``a
       McCarthyist effort to paint a false picture of the post-apartheid
       state'' by accusing anyone ever associated with the ANC who gains a
       prominent position of being advanced through cronyism or nepotism;


  (2) recognises that most people dedicated to the downfall of apartheid
       and the transformation of the state were members and supporters of
       the ANC;


  (3) concludes that if all people who support the ANC were precluded from
       public positions, as the DP would like, this would be a new form of
       job reservation, excluding those excluded under apartheid; and
  (4) calls on the DP to desist from its meaningless publicity-seeking that
       fools only the foolish and contributes nothing to the transformation
       of our country.

[Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Speaker, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the President's legal adviser Mojanku Gumbi was involved
       in putting pressure on the chairperson of the SA Telecommunications
       Regulatory Authority, Nape Maepa, to recuse herself from the
       licensing process of Satra;


  (2) further notes that this intervention has created the impression that
       the Presidency has acted improperly and has therefore cast doubts on
       the health of South Africa's investment and regulatory environment;
       and


  (3) calls on the Government to set up a judicial commission of inquiry
       into the role of the executive in the licensing process in order to
       signal a commitment to good governance on the part of the executive
       and improving South Africa's image amongst South Africa's investors.

[Applause.]

                             (Draft Resolution)

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock and sadness the loss of the thirteen school children
       in Chatsworth, KwaZulu-Natal, who died while enjoying themselves at
       the dance club Throb on 24 March 2000;
  (2) notes that this deliberate act of evil to sabotage the club with
       poisonous gas resulted in the loss of thirteen young, vibrant future
       leaders of South Africa;


  (3) extends its sympathy and condolences to the bereaved family and
       wishes the injured a speedy recovery;


  (4) calls on the Government to introduce strict legislation to either
       monitor or close down clubs operating in residential areas and to
       disallow children of a certain age group who are vulnerable to
       alcohol and drug abuse, entrance to clubs; and


  (5) calls for intensive investigation to be executed so that the deserved
       punishment would be meted out to the perpetrators.

Agreed to.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON LABOUR - BUDGET VOTE 19

Order taken without debate.
Report adopted.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 19 - Labour:

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Madam Speaker, today I speak under inspiration. I
am inspired not by those who arrogantly see themselves as the sole
repository of solutions to the challenges our country faces today. My
inspiration hails not from those who naively seek to offer simplistic, ill-
conceived and spurious theorems on how our country can raise levels of
investment, promote economic growth, create more jobs and eradicate
poverty. I draw my inspiration today from an indigenous African
philosopher, an aboriginal African prophet of unrivalled intellectual
capacity, who was quoted here by the Minister of Finance the other day. I
refer to a begotten son of the African continent, Ben Okri, who, on the eve
of the millennium, wrote as follows:


  Let's be wonderfully awake
  For what we are going to create,
  To make happen,
  In this mass co-scripting
  Of the future.

What a challenge. As we South Africans co-script our future, we are called
on to be ``wonderfully awake''. I interpret this to mean that we all have a
profound responsibility to know the direct and indirect, intended and
unintended, positive and negative consequences of our actions, not so that
we are incapacitated by indecision, but so that we can script a truly
wonderful future. Nowhere is this more challenging than in the labour
market, in the marketplace where people's labour is bought and sold. This
marketplace is, in so many ways, so unlike the one in which apples, tables
or cars, or similar inanimate objects - things - are exchanged.

In the labour market people agree to work for others in exchange for wages.
Such agreements are usually tempered by a limitation on a number of hours
to be worked or the output to be achieved - that is the conditions of
employment - because labour, unlike other things, is sold by ordinary
mortals of flesh and blood who therefore need to sleep, eat and recreate.

Some would have us believe that so sacred is this marketplace that it
should operate unfettered by ground rules. ``Let those that enter such
agreements settle the terms between themselves,'' they say. But few
subscribe to so radical a notion, hopefully no one in this House today,
because many of us are awake to the fact that not everyone enters into such
agreements freely and voluntarily.

Perhaps the clearest example of such people is children. Our Bill of Rights
enshrines the rights of children, amongst which is the right of every child
to be protected from exploitative labour practices. In other words, we have
all agreed that children are not free to sell their labour, and the laws
that prevent them from doing so are appropriate. The same would also most
likely apply to the worker rights contained in the Bill of Rights and those
conventions which are listed in the declaration of fundamental worker
rights passed by the International Labour Organisation.

The majority would probably also agree that laws should be passed to
protect people from agreeing to do work that is so dangerous that it
directly threatens their lives. If Mr Mokoena, Mr Mohamali, Mr Mkhabela had
known of a flaw in the plan to build the Njaka Bridge, would they have
signed on in July 1998 for a day's casual labour? We will never know
because they are dead as a result of the collapse of the bridge, together
with 11 others. The majority of us agree that a pursuit of profits cannot
be allowed to endanger human life. Indeed, it is subhuman to behave in this
way. So we have collectively agreed that such agreements cannot be freely
entered into. We are awake to this.

However, beyond the protection of children and the protection of the lives
of workers, once we enter the arena of improving the quality of life of all
citizens - a phrase contained in the preamble to the Constitution - there
are distinct differences of view. For example, the Basic Conditions of
Employment Act seeks to set a floor of rights, a minimum below which freely
entered into employment agreements cannot go.

The Act seeks to protect those who are notionally free, but in practice are
too vulnerable to protect themselves. These workers, such as domestic
workers and agricultural workers, are too dispersed, too trapped by the
daily grind of survival, and too vulnerable in the hands of many
unscrupulous and abusive madams and masters who deny them time to rest, to
worship or to attend to their family responsibilities.

It is our responsibility as Government to ensure that the employment
contracts of those susceptible to exploitation are in harmony with the
injunctions of our Constitution. The logic of this proposition is
challenged by those seeking to lower their wage bill. Driven by greed and
an insatiable appetite for profits, our detractors argue that desperate,
hungry people should be free to work below this floor of basic employment
conditions. They present economic models on wage elasticity, which claim to
prove that if wages and conditions fell to their lowest possible level
there would be more jobs. They pontificate that any job, however bad, is
better than no job at all.

Let us not romanticise this argument. It means quite literally that more
people should be free to work themselves to exhaustion and sickness, or
even death, for another's profit. So cunning are our detractors that they
have established reactionary formations whose ulterior motive is to deceive
the unemployed to support economic arguments that advance the interests of
the greedy minority.
Those who demand that we should lower labour standards argue that
employment opportunities will increase if workers are exposed to harsh and
inhuman employment conditions. Research shows that there is no necessary
link between legislating protection for workers and increasing
unemployment. Put differently, there is no empirical basis to suggest that
the lowering of labour standards results in a sustainable increase in job
creation. We therefore do not believe that either more or less regulation
will solve the crisis of unemployment.

But just as we must not romanticise this argument, so, too, must we be
vigilant of glib complacency. Of course, our critics allege that we are not
sufficiently awake to the consequences for those without work. I accept
that this is, and must remain, an issue of red alert for all of us.

Adrian du Plessis from Business South Africa was reported in The Star of 13
March 2000 to have said that ours is ``a labour market vision based on
employment in the formal sector, with rising wages offset by improvements
in productivity and the development of a broad skills base''. He went on to
say that such a vision has produced ``some unintended consequences''.
``Primary among these is that rising formal sector wages and improved
efficiencies have aggravated labour substitution, particularly of the
unskilled and less skilled persons at the margin of the labour market.''
He, however, came to the conclusion that ``a low wage labour market model
with a lower skills mix just was not on the cards'' given ``our particular
history and the special constellation of forces in our society''.

Adrian du Plessis is correct. This Government has decided that instead of
expanding the range of less free agreements in the labour market, it will
rather stimulate the growth of more and better jobs. This should not be
interpreted to mean that lower skilled and more labour-intensive sectors
are excluded. Quite the reverse. They are clearly to be encouraged if they
bring jobs. But rather the argument is that in all sectors - be they more
labour intensive or more capital intensive - there should be an upward
productivity pull, not a downward poverty collapse, because rising
productivity will ultimately result in increased investment and wealth
creation.

Where then are the new jobs to come from? I believe that they are to come
in three broadly defined segments of the labour market - formal sector
growth, small business growth and supporting development sector
initiatives. In respect of formal sector growth, as our President noted in
his state of the nation address:


  ... we have never been better positioned than we are today to achieve the
  progress we have to attain with regard to this important challenge. Many
  major indicators point to the excellent work that has been done to place
  our country on a strong growth path.

Growth rates of between 3,5% and 6,5% are predicted for the next two years.
But, left to itself, the formal sector could grow without absorbing the
majority of the unemployed in our country, so-called ``jobless growth'' or
``job-few growth'', or the benefits could take too long to reach the
unemployed. Complementary strategies are needed to stimulate productive
economic activity amongst the unemployed. Stimulation of small and micro
enterprises is the second key element of such a strategy, and the provision
of Government-funded or Government-enabled infrastructure and local
economic development initiatives is the third. Public-private partnerships
are emerging as an important means of leveraging private sector investment
into these programmes, as is the restructuring of state assets. Government,
as the largest employer in the land, can also influence economic behaviour
through its procurement policies.

These three elements of an overall employment strategy are mutually
reinforcing. Indeed, at the heart of Government's Reconstruction and
Development Programme from the start has been the idea that positive
synergies can be found between all three elements. In all of these it is
clear that labour market policies have a vital contribution to make to the
success of the overall orchestra of macroeconomic, fiscal, monetary,
industrial and development policies, if rising employment is to be the
outcome of this co-scripting of the future.

What then are the contributions to be made from the side of the labour
market to economic growth, stability and employment creation in the formal,
informal and development sectors? For the purposes of this address, I shall
cluster the contributions of my department into four themes and address the
contributions of each to employment stability and growth. The themes are
basic protection, the management of opposing interests, insurance in the
event of loss of employment and, finally, employment productivity and
equity promotion.

The first theme is basic protection. In the year ahead we shall continue to
roll out the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. In addition to the
sectoral determination for small business which modifies conditions of
employment in certain areas, such as overtime payment and hours of work,
further determinations will be published which will seek to achieve a
balance between accommodating the needs, primarily of small employers, and
protecting the rights of workers.

These determinations shall be in sectors which include significant numbers
of small employers, including domestic and farmworkers, and those in
retail, hospitality and clothing. We are also seeking to develop statutory
minimum levels of remuneration and conditions of employment for people in
job creation projects and people engaged in learnerships in the hospitality
industry, which is the new form of learning to promote access to the labour
market for the young.

This year we also see ourselves finalising a comprehensive programme of
action against the elimination of child labour, in line with the ILO
convention on eradicating the worst forms of child labour, which this
Parliament ratified recently. Also related to the imperative of basic
protection, I wish to bring Parliament's attention to the policy
developments in the area of occupational health and safety. Cabinet has
resolved to promote a more integrated approach to health and safety across
the labour market and across Government departments responsible for this,
namely the Departments of Labour, Minerals and Energy and Health, in order
to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Task teams have been established
to develop proposals and plans in order to give this decision force and
effect.

Under the second theme, viz the management of opposing interests, a format
for reaching employment agreements which has been put in place by the
Constitution, the National Economic, Development and Labour Council Act and
the Labour Relations Act, amongst others, is addressed. We have created a
set of bargaining institutions such as Nedlac, bargaining councils and
workplace forums on the one hand, and mechanisms to manage conflict such as
the CCMA and the Labour Court on the other, which we should be proud of.

However, the question I want to pose is whether we are using these
institutions to the best of our collective ability. Are we using them to
effectively achieve our vision of economic growth and wealth creation? My
assessment reveals that while each of these institutions contributes
towards achieving our vision, there is still room for improvement. My
department will explore, in the course of the year, mechanisms to enhance
the effectiveness of these important institutions.

The third theme is insurance against loss of employment. For workers the
threat of unemployment is often close to a life and death issue. The loss
of income associated with the loss of a job means no food on the table, no
money for schooling or educating the kids, no transport money to find new
jobs etc. Two strategies have traditionally been adopted with different
emphasis at different times.

The first is passive labour market measures and the second is more active
ones. Both seek to make times of change, particularly times of job loss,
less difficult. By making them less difficult it is hoped that people would
be more willing to change, hence there would be greater flexibility and
room for repositioning and adjustment. At the centre of passive labour
market intervention is the provision of insurance against unemployment,
which in South Africa translates into the Unemployment Insurance Fund. As
hon members are aware, we have recently published a new draft Bill which is
currently before Nedlac. Public comment closed on 31 March this year.

The new Bill seeks to address problems of sustainability of the fund. It
also seeks to widen the scope of coverage, graduate the benefits schedule,
delink maternity and unemployment benefits and strengthen compliance and
enforcement measures. The second passive labour market measure managed by
my department is compensation for occupational injuries and diseases. This
fund continues to be used to provide compensation to workers who are more
or less incapacitated at work.

On the more active side, my department has begun, in partnership with the
National Productivity Institute, to implement the social plan agreement.
This agreement was reached at the jobs summit in October 1998. It provides,
in the first place, for measures which seek to avoid retrenchment through
the promotion of future forums at work which can anticipate threats which
may lead to job losses.
In addition to the social plan technical support facility housed at the
National Productivity Institute, help is being provided to firms facing
productivity challenges which threaten jobs. Where retrenchments are
unavoidable, my department has geared itself to providing assistance at the
point of retrenchment, through the provision of information and advice, and
by providing training opportunities to help retrenchees find work in other
sectors.

In partnership with the Department of Provincial and Local Government, we
are also engaged in assisting communities that have been severely affected
by large-scale retrenchments. In the latter circumstances, my department
seeks to provide employment and skills development services that support
initiatives for new economic development. In the year that lies ahead, the
application of a social plan through the restructuring of state assets will
be the most challenging. Another active labour market measure is employment
and skills development services, which I will deal with under the theme
``employment, productivity and equity promotion'', to which I now turn.

Having addressed the question of core rights, having described the enabling
environment for collective bargaining and having put in place certain
active and passive measures which seek to protect workers when they lose
their jobs, some might say: ``Surely that is the total package of labour
market measures?'' In South Africa, these measures are indeed the necessary
elements of a labour market policy portfolio, but they fall short of being
sufficient.

Over and above these basics, there is a powerful imperative to actively
promote employment productivity and equity in our country. In all
instances, the market on its own has failed to adequately address these
issues. Our country is plaqued by inequality and a low-skills base by
virtue of its history. This legacy must be turned around if we are to
achieve our goal of a rising standard of living for all. To do this, it is
necessary for a mass co-scripting of the future to take place. This is
about reaching into the future, defining where we want to be, and then
putting in place the plans we need in order to move step by step towards
their achievement.

Setting goals and defining implementation plans backed up by people and
other resources is the key. We are painfully aware of the levels of
inequality that characterise our society in general, and our labour market
in particular. Without intervention, the situation seems to be getting
worse. Recent research commissioned for the Department of Labour has shown
that over the 25-year period from 1970 to 1995, there have been no net new
jobs for African workers. New jobs, such as there were, went to Indian,
coloured and white workers. Therefore the market on its own, cannot correct
the wrongs of the past. Indeed, it appears to mirror them. The drawing up
of employment equity plans, ie the setting of targets and developing of
strategies to correct historical inequalities, is a key mechanism this
Government is promoting in order to address the problem.

By June this year we will receive the first employment equity reports from
employers. We hope that we will be able to identify both the extent of
compliance with the Act, including the racial, gender and disability
profile of our workplaces, and the good and bad measures that employers are
taking in order to bring these profiles into line with national and
regional demographics. These reports should further assist us to establish
whether, indeed, these measures are moving towards the target of a more
just labour market.
A similar approach is adopted in relation to skills development. Again, we
know that South Africa's workforce has skills levels that reflect the
shameful outcome of apartheid education and training policies. It is
estimated that only 20% of our workforce could be called skilled or highly
skilled, while the skills levels required in the formal sector have risen
dramatically over the past 25 years. As such, there is an absolute mismatch
between the skills demanded and the skills available in the labour market.

Vukani ke mzi kaNtu nithathe loo mkhonto nibinze. Yakukhala ke ze nikhwaze

[People of Afrika wake up and take the sword and thrust. When it bellows
you must shout and say, ``Our offering has been accepted.'' Ngcwabe says,
in his book entitled, Khala Zome, specifically in his poem entitled,
Imbumba yamanyama:


  Latshona ilanga umhlambi usendle
  baye phi abelusi, ziye phi iinkokeli
  Luyafa usapho luqwengwa ziingcuka

This ANC-led Government, the organisation for the nation, has provided
people with mechanisms to fight for their rights at work. Yes, the battle
will not be easy, but it was started by you on the day you voted last year.
Why fold your arms when there is war on all fronts? We want warriors to
implement and protect this freedom. Prepare for battle and march forward
with heads held high.

Take out your shields and make a challenge to all workers. Say with one
voice that discrimination on the basis of gender, disability and colour
must be eradicated totally from the workplace. Say this is the year!
Employers must come forward with plans and reports.

Tell them again that Ngcwabe says, in his poem:


  Ungathetha uxele izulu ligqekreza
  uthethe de uphalaze iinyembezi
  ungekasibonisi ukusebenza
  akukasixeleli nto usathule.

And Jolobe says, in one of his poems entitled, Ukwenziwa komkhonzi:


  Inge ingamangala ikhusel' ilungelo

  lolwezulu uqeqesho olujonge umqeqeshwa

Do not allow yourselves to be tamed. Struggle on because success does not
come easily and it only comes to those who show persistence. This journey
of ours is very long, but a traveller does not give up. Keep on making this
loud noise until everyone who does not yet hear it does hear of. Indeed,
everyone blows his own trumpet.]

This state of affairs is inhibiting new investment, slowing down the
diffusion of new technology and new productivity-enhancing forms of work
organisation, and even stratifying the expansion of the small business
sector.

Of course, there is a fundamental need to enhance the education system and
improve the quality of learning that new entrants bring with them when they
enter the labour market. However, this strategy needs to be augmented by
interventions which seek to improve the matching of skills developed with
those needed. The skills development strategy seeks to fill this gap. It
seeks to put in place a financial incentive through the levy grant system
and a set of industry-owned change agents, known as sector education and
training authorities, that will drive behavioural change in large and small
firms the right way.

The key point in relation to both the Skills Development Act and the
Employment Equity Act is that the processes of plan writing and planning
implementation are the means we intend to use in order to change the
profile of our labour market. Together with the active participation of all
social partners, we must change our labour market from one which is
characterised by low skills linked to high levels of inequality, to one
which has rising skills, to rising productivity, competitiveness,
employment and the complete eradication of all discrimination. Skills
development and employment equity are also intended to help those that are
currently unemployed or who are students about to leave full-time learning
and enter the job market.

Recruitment and selection criteria will need to favour those previously
disadvantaged, and 20% of the levy funds collected is to be dedicated to
helping these vulnerable groups to build their skills base to a level at
which they can enter and re-enter the labour market - in the formal sector,
in a small or micro business or in a developmental project. There will be
skill and equity targets with plans at the level of workplaces, skill and
equity targets with plans at the level of economic sectors, skill and
equity targets with plans within communities and provinces, and skill and
equity targets with plans for the nation. In this way we have begun to mass
co-script a truly wonderful future for our country.
At the heart of the success of all these plans is the commitment and energy
of our people. The labour market need not only be the place where alienated
individuals buy and sell their labour power within a set of basic rules
which hold back the market jungle. It can also be the place where organised
people with vision and commitment for a greater future are able to envision
a dream and then put in place concrete and practical steps to reach it step
by step.

As Ben Okri put it:


  We are, more or less
  The makers of the future.
  We create what time will frame.

[Applause.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, hon members of this
House, the ANC reaffirmed at its 50th national conference in Mafikeng that
the basic economic and social transformation framework is the RDP. In order
to give effect to its programme of fundamental economic transformation it
committed itself to developing a programme of further legislative changes
and to clear timeframes with deliverables and the implementation plan.

It is for this reason that the ANC Government, in its manifesto, confirmed
that it recognised the right to fair labour practices, the right to form
and join trade unions and to strike in terms of procedures outlined in the
Labour Relations Act. Employers cannot employ and fire at will as a result
of the protection in section 185 of the LRA and the code of good practice.
There is also the extension of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to
all vulnerable employees through sectoral determinations and in
consultation with all stakeholders.

On measures to redress the imbalances of the past, employers are to
implement affirmative action measures as outlined in section 9(2) of the
Constitution and in the Employment Equity Act so as to prohibit unfair
discrimination and for the protection of the majority of the electorate.
The ANC is concerned with improving the skills of workers through the
Skills Development Act and with the funding thereof.

The system of learnership for the young and unemployed is in place. The
setting up of sectoral education and training authorities is to be
established, as it is by now, to ensure that training addresses the needs
and requirements of the sector. Workers are given the right to refuse work
that can harm the environment and themselves through the National
Environment Management Act. It established Nedlac to give workers and
communities a say over policy formulation.

Ditsela was launched through a grant from the Department of Labour, and no
fewer than 1 483 unionists were trained in the two years up to 1999. The
list is endless as it further includes the Presidential Jobs Summit. It is
against this commitment that the ANC needs to remind political
organisations such as the DP that had no interest in the needs of the
oppressed working class, including the poorest of the poor and the
unemployed, that it inherited problems that manifest themselves in the form
of joblessness and economic stagnation which were created by the
nationalist capitalist production process. These production systems ignored
the multifaceted, productive component which comprised labour, capital
material and technological management, but blamed everything - I repeat,
blamed everything - on the least-paid labour force, including retrenchment.
The apartheid laws and policies did not create an enabling environment that
allowed for employment security; that allowed for productivity and
competitiveness; that allowed for gainsharing as a benefit to workers,
customers and shareholders; that allowed participation and consultation;
and that allowed career pathing and skill formation for all, as well as
work organisation that would enhance industrial harmony, productivity and
motivation.

The labour market has high rates of unemployment and underemployment. The
low rate at which productive employment is being created in the economy,
more so in the private sector; the existence of widespread poverty among
low-wage earners and the unemployed; the extreme level of unequality,
primarily on the basis of race and gender; the low level of education,
skills and investment in training; the legacy of adversarial labour
relations in the formal economy; and the inadequate protection of some low-
wage earners, such as farmworkers and domestic workers, were all
exacerbated by the then institutions of apartheid and officials who were -
and are still - loyal to the then government.

We in the ANC commend the hon the Minister of Labour for the good work he
and his department have done so far. We further believe that the R748
million allocated to the department will, indeed, fulfil the mandate to
deliver on the following: Reducing unemployment, poverty and inequality
through policies and programmes developed in consultation with role-players
- that is business, Government, labour and communities - and are aimed at
improved economic efficiency and productivity, skills  development,
employment creation and sound labour relations, as well as eliminating
inequality and discrimination in the workplace, alleviating poverty, and
protecting and enhancing worker rights and benefits.

A more pragmatic approach, through the mandate we all have - except, of
course, any group that might be confused - as entrenched in the
Constitution of South Africa in its preamble and in sections 1 and 2,
relating to the supremacy of the Constitution, section 9 and 9(2),
specifically on equity, and section 23 in general, is a commitment to the
improvement of the quality of life of all citizens, the freedom and the
potential of every person in this country. Hence it acknowledges the
democratic values and honours the supremacy of the Constitution and the
fundamental human rights in general.
One of the instruments that can redress the above-mentioned imbalances is
the acceleration of the implementation of the Presidential Jobs Summit
resolutions, as it has been hampered by other stakeholders. We have labour,
who had to consult first before a one-day contribution could be made. To
this effect we must commend the Public Service unions, on behalf of 1
million members, for having made this breakthrough towards the Umsobomvu
Fund, and all those who have contributed already.

We must confirm that the department passed the Employment Equity Act in
1998, and what is in place is the piecemeal phasing-in approach. This Act
provides for equity in employment. This Act, in order to promote the
constitutional rights of equity and the exercise of democracy, calls for
the elimination of discrimination in employment. It calls for Government
and employers to ensure the implementation of employment equity to redress
the ill-effects of discrimination; it calls for an achievement of a diverse
workforce that is broadly representative of our people; it seeks to promote
economic development and efficiency in the workplace; and it gives effect
to the obligations of the republic as a member of the ILO.

The ANC Government, through this Act, has identified the target group of
employers and beneficiaries called the designated group comprising of
employers with over 50 employees and a high turnover, including the
Government, black people, women of all races and people with disabilities
who were disadvantaged in the past. The ANC Government, through this Act,
requires these employers in consultation with worker representatives, to do
an organisational audit that will reflect the anomalies and imbalances at
the workplace in relation to section 19 of the Employment Equity Act. This
entails the following: Information on employment policies, practices,
procedures and the working environment in order to identify employment
barriers which adversely affect the people from the designated groups.

There must be an analysis that must include a profile, as prescribed, of
the designated employer's workforce within each occupational category and
level, in order to determine the degree of underrepresentation of people
from the designated group in various occupational categories and levels in
that employer's workforce. Having made the above analysis, the designated
employer must prepare and implement an employment equity plan which will
achieve reasonable progress towards employment equity and implementation.
This plan must state the objectives to be achieved each year; affirmative-
action measures, in conjunction with unions; numerical goals to achieve an
equitable representation; timetables and objectives other than numerical
goals; duration of the plan, which may not be shorter than one year and
longer than five years; procedures for monitoring and evaluation; an
internal dispute procedure; and the person responsible for the monitoring
and evaluation of the plan.

It further outlines the criteria of employment interview and consideration,
which include formal qualifications related to the job requirement,
recognition of prior learning, relevant experience, and the capacity to
acquire, within a reasonable time, the ability to do the job. In making a
final determination, an employer may not unfairly discriminate against a
person on the grounds that the person lacks the relevant experience. It
must be noted that most black women and the disabled do not secure jobs,
because the panel comprises predominantly white males who make entry into
gainful employment very difficult. It is for this reason that the Act
provides for enforcement measures and monitoring mechanisms that will
ensure compliance.

The Act further makes room for representatives of the workforce to be party
to any decision that relates to recruitment, employment, training,
placement, career pathing, affirmative action, and the total implementation
of the employment equity plan before being submitted to the Department of
Labour. It is, therefore, crucial that we call upon all women, both black
and white, the disabled and the youth, and disadvantaged blacks to stand up
and look around for the nearest labour centre which has been transformed
into a centre of excellence, any ANC constituency office or any local
government and welfare offices for advice, guidance or help.

Ngeli thuba lolu lwabiwo-mali, masimbulele uMongameli wethu, uMbeki,

[On this occasion of the labour appropriation let us thank our President,
Mr Mbeki, for leading South Africa at this critical time when the beasts
are so greedy for the votes of the black people. Again, let us thank hon
Mdladlana and his Ministry of Labour for leading the Presidential Jobs
Summit as well as facilitating the satisfactory accomplishment of its
decisions in such a manner that they changed the old method that the
Department of Labour applied. [Time expired.]]

Mr R J HEINE: Mr Chairman and hon members, the Financial Mail runs with the
headline ``Time to say I want you'' to foreign investors. The German
financial institution DEG urges the Government to relax rigid labour
policies and clothing companies in KwaZulu-Natal beg for relief as the wage-
cost crunch bites. Yet, all the while Government expresses its amazement
that already hard-pressed businesses are not queuing up to register for the
skills levy and the hon the Minister of Labour urges the unions to embark
on a national strike, come May 10. The paradox is breathtaking.

When the premier of Mpumalanga, the hon Mr Mahlangu, said it was okay for
politicians to lie, he was lambasted for doing so. I would like to make it
perfectly clear that, while I hold no brief for the hon Mr Mahlangu
whatsoever, what the hon the Minister of Labour had to say to hundreds of
workers in Johannesburg on March 17 was, quite frankly, no less shocking
and certainly far more damaging.

Instead of slapping down the unions and telling them in clear, unambiguous
terms that strikes will merely damage the economy and will result in
further job losses and less foreign direct investment, the hon the Minister
stands up and says that he does not want to be a strong labour Minister
with weak unions. He beats his chest, thumps his fist and urges the unions
to defend their revolutionary values by taking part in Cosatu's planned
protest action against the private sector at the beginning of May. He says
he would rather resign than see the unions go soft. Despite the negative
impact and repercussions that this statement is likely to have on South
Africa's ability to attract significant levels of foreign direct
investment, Government has remained remarkably silent on this matter.

The hon the Ministers of Finance and of Trade and Industry must be fuming.
How on earth do they explain to potential investors that yes, the hon the
Minister of Labour supports the unions and actually urges them to go on
strike, that these actions disrupt core business functions and are costing
money while, at the same time, persuade them to come to South Africa with
their foreign exchange and jobs? I would hate to be in their shoes.

The hon the Minister should be encouraging the unions to back down from
their present course of action. He should be advocating a policy of hard
work, mutual respect and stability in the labour market. He should not be
seen whipping up emotions and leading the attack against the business
sector.

In the Budget we learned that the Department of Labour will counter the
prevailing global trend to downsize and streamline. We discovered it would
actually increase its staff numbers from 5¬†400 to 6¬†000. These additional
600 posts will mostly be for ``job cops'', people who will be dedicated to
ensuring that the stifling requirements of South Africa's debilitating and
expensive labour legislation are adhered to by the business sector.

The department will spend R144 million or 19% of its budget on policing
those businesses who pay the taxes that go towards the budget allocations
in the first place. Instead of opening up the labour market to allow for
greater competition and movement, the Department of Labour will tighten the
screws. We will have our job cops who will punish businesses for wanting to
expand and employ more South Africans, and we will probably see some half-
baked amendments to our labour laws.

The very same businesses that the hon the Minister will be responsible for
policing, have made significant contributions to job creation, and the
records speak for themselves. The Jobs Summit resolved that Government,
business and organised labour would each create funds in a national effort
to create jobs. However, so far only the business fund has made any
progress. The Business Trust was established in July 1999 and has reached
R750 million of its R1 billion target. The board has already allocated R650
million to projects and signed six of an envisaged seven strategic
partnerships. A further R850 million was allocated to the Umsobomvu Fund.
Most of this money came from taxes on the demutualisation of Old Mutual and
Sanlam. This fund is under the control of the hon the Minister of Finance.

Organised labour, meanwhile, has done nothing with its Job Creation Trust,
which has accumulated R25 million in voluntary contributions from
unionists, private individuals and the business sector who donated one
day's salary. The trust is jointly run by Cosatu, the Federation of Labour
Unions and the National Council of Trade Unions. It has a management board,
but this has met only once since its inception. It has not released any
money nor has it begun any projects. Fedusa's Deputy General Secretary, Mr
Dennis George, says the fund has operational difficulties because it lacks
administrators. It is obvious that the unions are not interested in
creating jobs. They are more busy organising strikes and, with the blessing
of the hon the Minister of Labour, they want to hurt the business sector
even more, notwithstanding the contribution it has made to job creation and
skills development.

While the hon the Minister kowtows to the unions and their members, he says
that the labour laws will be reviewed to make it even more difficult to
hire and fire people. While this flies in the face of what the business
community is crying out for, the Government itself is guilty of ignoring
some of the most basic and fundamental tenets of its very own labour
legislation.
For instance, the former Director of Labour in the Western Cape, Mr Brian
Williams, was suspended in October 1998 on full salary. As a result of the
department's incompetence in getting to grips with the provisions of the
labour laws, which it was responsible for drafting in the first place, Mr
Williams appeared before the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration and two disciplinary hearings over a 12-month period, costing
the taxpayer R824 000 in legal fees. However, efforts to oust Mr Williams
failed and he was reinstated in his original position from 1 November 1999,
only to have a final settlement package negotiated, whereupon he left the
department less than two months later. I am told that the terms of the
settlement are confidential, and I can only guess what Mr Williams was paid
to keep quiet and to go quietly.

Allow me to offer the House another example. In Mpumalanga the MEC for
Education, Mr Craig Padayachee, has been ordered to pay more than R2,6
million to Mrs Sithole, the former Education MEC, who was fired because of
the 1998 matric examinations scandal. The Pretoria High Court ruled that
Mrs Sithole's contract had been unlawfully terminated, violating the terms
of the Labour Relations Act.
Perhaps the most startling indication of the Government's labour law
inflexibility and rigidity is the news that the Chief Executive Officer of
the SA Airways, Mr Coleman Andrews, has applied for a full exemption from
the Basic Conditions of the Employment Act. This, in itself, is one of the
most damning indictments of the Government's labour policy. For a
Government-owned airline to ask for exemption of this sort just goes to
show how rigid the legal provisions are, and how difficult and costly they
are to comply with.

If the Government is trying to duck and dive when it comes to the labour
laws, how does it expect the private sector to fall in line? The Government
has far more in the way of resources, both in terms of money and staff,
than ordinary businesses; and yet it is unable to follow the correct
procedures when it comes to dismissing personnel.

I think the hon the Minister should draw a salient lesson from these few
examples. He should ensure that the labour law amendments which are due to
be brought before Parliament in August loosen their provisions. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Mr Chairman, hon members, we are more or less the makers
of the future. We create what time will frame.

Ngivumelana naleliya lungu ngalokho elikushilo. Ngithi lokho elikushilo
ngokwethu. [I agree with what the hon member has just said. I say he has
expressed our view.]

It is, however, regrettable that this department's budget has been cut by
R90 million, roughly 10% of the previous financial year's total. The
decrease of 5,7% in the funding for training of staff must be a cause for
concern to everybody. The reason provided is that an increase in line-
function activities means that less funding is available for training. This
is not consistent with the increase in the appointments of inspectors.
Surely more funding should have been made available for training the newly
appointed inspectors.

An employment skills development survey shows that the largest decrease is
in this budget. The explanation for cutting this budget in this particular
sphere and transferring it to the National Skills Fund does not tell the
entire story. The fact of the matter is that the department will not be
able to maintain its services to the unemployed and the unskilled in the
forthcoming financial year.

However, we welcome the increase in allocation to the SA National Council
for the Blind and the National Council for the Physically Disabled, as it
shows some commitment to the improvement of the position of the
handicapped, as is required by the Constitution. The IFP supports the
budget for the 2000-01 financial year, but I have this to say to the hon
the Minister.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Uyayimosha manje! [You are spoiling it
now!]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Angiyimoshi. Ake lithule lelo lunga elihloniphekile! [I
am not spoiling it. Could that hon member please be quiet!]

I want to make an earnest appeal to our Minister of Labour to play a
crucial role as a referee in this team of economic Ministers.
[Interjections.] He must make it very clear to his colleagues how important
it is to ensure the creation of more jobs in the future. The Minister must
pressurise his colleagues to help him to stimulate job creation. If they do
not listen, the Minister must report them to me. [Laughter.]

In spite of what many businesspeople would like us to believe, including
some politicians, they must all be told that the contrary is true: The
problem with the South African economy is not about trade unions per se. It
is about our wrong and misplaced attitudes about trade unionism in this
country. [Applause.] It is time we accepted the fact that no country can
prosper economically if it continues to ignore the workers as the backbone
of the economy of the country. [Interjections.]

Now is the time for employers, both in the public and private sectors, to
be honest with themselves and with the workers, particularly when they talk
of downsizing, outsourcing and redeployment because, at the end of the day,
all this means retrenchment and the loss of jobs. So they must not play
around with these terms where workers are concerned.

In this regard, I want to further appeal to the Minister to again use his
influence, particularly on his colleagues in the Cabinet, to help him
revisit the present status of the Insolvency Act which is being abused by
many employers. The Minister's proposals to overhaul the Unemployment
Insurance Act is also commended by the IFP. We support this and we want to
advise the Minister that, in this regard, he must consider increasing the
contributions to the fund. Secondly, the benefit must be extended from six
months to 12 months. Thirdly, the benefits payable should not be subject to
normal taxation as is the case now.

Furthermore, I want to bring it to the Minister's attention - and he has
already mentioned it in his speech - the question of child labour which
still thrives in this country. This is shocking.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired.

Mr N S MIDDLETON: It can never be! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It is, so please be seated.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr S M RASMENI: Chairperson, hon members of Parliament, I think I agree
with hon Middleton that the DP's attitude is against unions. If the DP had
its way, we would never have had unions in this country. [Interjections.]
However, I must tell them and advise them that unfortunately for them,
unions are here, and they are here to stay. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr S M RASMENI: The programmes of the Department of Labour are based on
sound policies. These include playing a significant role in reducing
unemployment, poverty and inequality through policies and programmes that
have been developed in consultation with the role-players and which are
aimed at improved economic efficiency and productivity, skills development
and employment creation, sound labour relations, the elimination of
inequality and discrimination at the workplace, and the protection and
enhancement of workers' rights and benefits. It is our hope that the budget
of R748 327 000 will go a long way towards the implementation of the
policies and programmes of this department.

The ANC Government - our Government - and the Department of Labour in
particular, need to be commended for the work well done in such a short
space of time. The establishment of a labour market policy and a
legislative framework which enabled bodies of conflicting interest, labour
and business, to talk to each other and to contribute positively to shaping
sound labour relations after many years of industrial conflict and turmoil
which saw workers being killed, imprisoned and fighting in factions, should
be commended. These acts were carried out by both the apartheid government
and industrial bosses through their military police and the notorious
induna systems.

Today, we are proud to have created institutions such as Nedlac and the
CCMA to settle disputes, labour courts, employment conditions commissions
and many other structures for the good and benefit of employers, labour and
the people of South Africa. For the first time, after many years, South
Africa enjoys membership of and plays a significant role in the
International Labour Organisation. These achievements have not come about
as hand-outs or manna from heaven. They are the gains brought about by the
struggle led by the ANC, acting together with its alliance partners and the
great majority of South Africans.

The ANC, with the overwhelming majority of our people, defeated the
apartheid government in April 1994. So, together, we should build a better
life for all. A nation of equals, of proud citizens with a restored
dignity, is emerging. In the past five years the ANC has been leading a
vast process of change against the odds, faced with challenges and
resistance. The ANC remains resolute in the struggle to remove the
apartheid system and all that remains of its practices such, as the
oppression and victimisation of farmworkers and domestic workers.

The farmworkers and farming community find themselves trapped in a vicious
cycle that is very difficult to break. Violation of basic human rights by
farmers, the employers, is the order of the day and forms part and parcel
of conditions of employment and conditions of living and staying in the
farming areas. The denial of labour rights, exploitation, payment of slave
wages and worse, the killing of farmworkers and their children, can never
be divorced from the system of apartheid capitalism of which the DP is a
part. [Interjections.] This is the same system which we referred to as
``colonialism of a special type'' and which we managed to fight in the
factories, in the mines and in the entire country.
It is very clear that some farmers are still bent on perpetuating what were
discriminatory laws and practices even though such laws do not exist on our
Statute Book. Black workers are earning 7,5% of the wages earned by white
workers. Year after year, as we celebrate Human Rights Day, many of our
people working and living on the farms are unfairly dismissed and evicted,
and their families and children thrown out. Children have no option but to
break off their schooling.

We dare not forget the shooting and killing of Angeline Zwane, aged six, at
Zesfontein near Benoni, and the fatal killing of Ralph Motlane, nine years
old, by the farmer at Krokodildrif farm near Swartruggens. Violation of the
human rights of farm workers was perpetrated in the Tshipise district in
the Northern Province by a farmer and private security operator. A farmer
refused to allow the burial of the late Mr Serote, who had worked and lived
for 30 years on Lillispan farm near Coligny in the North West. Lizzie
Mokwema, nine years old, was crushed and killed by a farmer's bakkie in
Delareyville. Farmers prevent labour inspectors from entering farms when
doing their inspections. They set dogs on those inspectors who happen to be
black.
We are disappointed by the naked racism displayed by two white farmers who
were interviewed by a journalist from The Sunday Independent after the
imprisonment of Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche. They had this to say, and I quote:


  ... Will Eug√®ne be safe in prison? If anything happens to Eugene, more
  blacks will die than at Blood River.

Another had this to say, and I quote:


  The trouble with people like you is that you don't know what a kaffir is.
  I do because I work with them. And if I call my dog a kaffir, it would be
  an insult to the dog.

All these bad practices and racial remarks are just a symbol of the last
kicks of a dying horse such as the DP. [Laughter.] The long arm of the law
is catching up with them.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, please keep to the
Vote at hand. [Applause.]

Mr S M RASMENI: They should ask Eug√©ne de Kock and Eug√®ne Terre'Blanche.
We are pleased to learn from the Minister that the department intends
extending the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to the farm and domestic
workers ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr D M BAKKER: Mnr die Voorsitter, artikel 10 van ons Grondwet waarborg
die inherente waardigheid van elke burger, en bepaal dat elkeen die reg het
dat sy of haar waardigheid gerespekteer en beskerm moet word.

In die beskerming van ons grondwetlike beginsels kan ons dus nie toelaat
dat die waardigheid van ons mense aangetas word nie. Wat kan die
waardigheid van 'n persoon wat w√≠l werk maar nie k√°n werk nie omdat daar
nie werkgeleenthede is nie, meer aantas as juis die feit dat hy of sy nie
in a posisie is om sy of haar verantwoordelikheid teenoor 'n gesin, 'n
familielid, 'n kind of kinders na te kom om voedsel op die tafel of 'n dak
oor hulle koppe te plaas nie?

Ongelukkig is daar baie sulke mense in ons land. Werkloosheid is aan die
toeneem eerder as aan die afneem. Slegs een uit 30 werksoekers het 'n kans
op sukses. Volgens Statistiek Suid-Afrika het meer as 43 000
werkgeleenthede in die formele besigsheidsektor in die laaste drie maande
van 1999 verlore gegaan, en meer as 120 000 werkgeleenthede tussen Desember
1998 en Desember 1999, en dan praat ons nie eens van plaasarbeiders nie.
Dit terwyl Gear, die Regering se makro-ekonomiese beleid, 833¬†000 nuwe
werkgeleenthede tussen 1996 en 2000 belowe het, en daarn√° 409¬†000
werkgeleenthede per jaar in elke daaropvolgende jaar. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D M BAKKER: Mr Chairman, section 10 of our Constitution guarantees the
inherent dignity of every citizen, and states that everyone has the right
to have his or her dignity respected and protected.

In the protection of our constitutional principles we therefore cannot
allow the dignity of our people to be assailed. What can assail the dignity
of a person who wants to work but cannot work, because there are no job
opportunities, more than precisely the fact that he or she is not in a
position to honour his or her obligations towards a family, a relative, a
child or children, to provide them with food or a roof over their heads?

Unfortunately there are many such people in our country. Unemployment is
increasing rather than decreasing. Only one out of 30 job-seekers has a
chance of being successful. According to Statistics South Africa more than
43 000 job opportunities were lost in the formal business sector during the
last three months of 1999, and more than 120 000 between December 1998 and
December 1999, and here we are not even speaking about farm labourers. This
happened while Gear, the Government's macroeconomic policy, promised 833
000 new job opportunities between 1996 and 2000, and 409 000 job
opportunities per year in every subsequent year.]

Government's economic report looks impressive. The GDP growth rate is up,
foreign direct investment is up, inflation is down, the interest rate is
considerably down, foreign reserves are up and the budget deficit as a
percentage of gross domestic product is down. Everything looks good until
one comes to South Africa's labour policy. The question is therefore: Why
are we not seeing any results?

Ondanks baie goeie werk deur die Regering op ekonomiese gebied, is daar
steeds geen beduidende regstreekse vaste investering in die land nie. Die
land is redelik suksesvol met die lok van korttermynportefeuljebeleggings,
maar dit is geld wat oornag kan uitstroom.

Die agb Minister van Finansies, Trevor Manuel, s√™ in 'n onderhoud dat die
Regering se beleid tot op datum nie werk geskep het nie en dat 'n
beleidsverandering nodig is. President Mbeki het in sy Openingsrede onder
meer ges√™ arbeidswetgewing moet gewysig word in 'n poging om die
struikelblokke in die pad van buitelandse investering uit die weg te ruim.
In Februarie vanjaar, n√° die ANC se nasionale uitvoerende komiteeberaad, s√™
die ANC-woordvoerder, Smuts Ngonyama, dat 'n regering nie werk kan skep
nie, maar slegs die omgewing tot stand kan bring om werkskepping te
bevorder. Hierdie uitsprake is baie bemoedigend en begin die indruk wek dat
die Regering erns het met werkskepping. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Despite very good work by the Government in the economic sphere, there is
still no significant direct fixed investment in the country. The country is
fairly successful in attracting short-term portfolio investments, but this
is money that can flow out overnight.

The hon the Minister of Finance, Trevor Manuel, said in an interview that
the Government's policy had to date not created jobs, and that a change in
policy was needed. In his Opening Address President Mbeki said, inter alia,
that labour legislation should be amended in an effort to remove the
obstacles in the way of foreign investment. In February this year, after
the conference of the ANC national executive committee, ANC spokesman Smuts
Ngonyama said that a government could not create employment, but could only
create the environment which could promote job creation. These statements
are very encouraging and are starting to create the impression that the
Government is serious about job creation.]

But for this very reason it is very discouraging to read headlines stating,
and I quote, ``Mdladlana turns Mbeki's speech into a Rubicon''.

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Who is that? Who is that?

Mr D M BAKKER: That is you, Minister. [Interjections.] We all agree that
there is no quick fix for unemployment, but what is needed is for the
Minister of Labour to take some hard decisions and to start implementing
some of those decisions required in terms of the labour policy. After the
President commissioned a review to assess the extent to which labour
policies could be impacting adversely on the imperatives of investment
attraction and employment creation strategies, the hon the Minister started
a process to review labour legislation and to introduce amendments by
appointing a task team under the head of his former director-general and by
holding a series of consultations with social partners.

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! What is your point of order?

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is it parliamentary for
the member not to refer appropriately to the Minister?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.
Please be seated.

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, what is it?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! It is not a point order and I
am ruling on that. Please be seated. [Laughter.] Please continue.

Mr D M BAKKER: Chairperson, in reply to a question put to the Minister last
September, he stated:

At this stage, we have not identified any aspects of labour laws that have
proven to be obstacles to the creation of jobs. What we have identified is
that there is a problem of negative perceptions about our labour laws and
that these perceptions impact on reality ...

Ever since then the hon the Minister, who is a former president of the SA
Democratic Teachers' Union, affiliated to Cosatu, has been very vague as to
what exactly the amendments to the existing legislation are that he and his
department are proposing. We continuously hear remarks by the hon the
Minister that the results of the process demonstrated in no uncertain terms
that the fundamentals of our labour market policy are sound and that the
overall thrust of our legislative framework remains correct. We hear him
saying that no one has given him a definition of flexibility. He keeps on
referring to ``regulated flexibility'', but places his emphasis on
``regulated'' without saying anything about ``flexibility''.

What is now needed is for the hon the Minister to outline in detail
precisely what he and his department are actually committed to doing for
job creation. The general state of uncertainty which is prevailing at the
moment is doing nothing to boost business confidence, and swift and
decisive action is now long overdue. Employment creation is not only
determined by economic growth, but also by the employment-creating capacity
of the economy. The latter, in turn, is determined to a very large extent
by the cost of labour relative to that of capital. To say that excessive
increases in the cost of labour hamper employment is stating the obvious.

In a policy research document published in 1993, the World Bank came to the
conclusion that the success achieved by some of the East Asian countries in
eradicating unemployment could, to a large extent, be attributed to labour
policies that succeeded in keeping the labour cost marginally below market-
clearing levels. Rigid or inflexible labour markets and cost-increasing
labour legislation, labour policies and labour practices give rise to high
and rapidly increasing labour costs and inhibit employment creation,
especially under conditions of increasing international competition. In
order to cope with increased competition the only choice employers often
have is to reduce the wage bill through the curtailment of employment,
especially of lower-skilled workers.

The cost of labour also includes the direct and indirect cost of labour
arising from labour practices and labour legislation, as well as strikes,
stayaways, go-slows, intimidation etc. The obstacles to job creation are
clear. What is needed is for the Minister to take decisive decisions.

Tot dusver het die berg nog net 'n muis gebaar. Die agb Minister bly
halstarrig vasklou aan 'n oordrewe beskerming van die aristokrasie van sy
ou vakbond. Sy party het in 1994 werk aan almal beloof, en terwyl goeie
vordering op ander gebiede gemaak word en baie van sy kabinetskollegas
wesenlike ideologiese en beleidsveranderings toegepas het, blyk dit asof
die agb Minister slegs bereid is om kosmetiese verslappings van
arbeidswetgewing te oorweeg.
¬†
Die Nuwe NP doen 'n vriendelike beroep op die agb Minister en sy
departement om die voorbeeld van sekere van sy kollegas te volg en
daadwerklik iets omtrent werkskepping te doen. [Tyd verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Thus far the mountain has only brought forth a mouse. The hon the Minister
is obstinately clinging to the excessive protection of the aristocracy of
his old trade union. In 1994 his party promised jobs for everyone, and
while good progress has been made in other areas, and many of his
colleagues in the Cabinet have implemented substantial ideological and
policy changes, it would seem as if the hon the Minister is only prepared
to consider cosmetic relaxations when it comes to labour legislation.

The New NP appeals politely to the hon the Minister and his department to
follow the example of some of his colleagues and really do something about
job creation. [Time expired.]]

Mr T M GONIWE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: According to Rule 61,
no member shall refer to any other member by his or her first name, or
names only. I distinctly heard the previous speaker referring to the
Minister as ``Mdladlana''. He did not say ``the honourable''.
¬†
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, if you read very
carefully, you will see after the photograph of the hon Minister, that what
you are quoting now is his surname. If the pronunciation was wrong, we can
understand. If the name was totally wrong, I would allow your point of
order.

Mr T M GONIWE: My point is about ``honourable''. One is supposed to say
``the hon Mdladlana''.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I agree on that. All members in this
House are to be addressed as ``the honourable''. In many cases in this
House most members sometimes omit ``the honourable''. It is disappointing
to us, and we ask all members to use the word ``honourable''. Thank you.

Mr D M BAKKER: Chair, may I address you on the point of order that you have
just ruled upon.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is it further to what that hon member
raised, sir?
Mr D M BAKKER: Sir, in every respect in my speech at all stages I referred
to the Minister as ``the hon Minister'' and in Afrikaans to ``die agb
Minister' ...

... behalwe wanneer ek aangehaal het, uit 'n koerantberig waar dit direk na
die Minister verwys het, sonder om ``agbare'' te gebruik. Dit is die punt
waaroor ek u toespreek in di√© verband. [... except when I quoted from a
newspaper report which referred directly to the Minister, without using the
word ``honourable''. That is the point on which I am addressing you in this
regard.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, we accept your bona fides
and we know your intention was good. He has been quoting from a newspaper
and that is how the name came about. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: He did not pronounce my surname correctly!
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, you will have
your time. [Interjections.] Order! Hon Minister, you will have your time at
the podium.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, the UDM supports this Vote. The UDM supports
and welcomes the transformation brought about by the Department of Labour
in the workplace.

In terms of the introductory remarks of the Department of Labour, as
contained in the explanatory memorandum, the aim and objective is to play a
significant role - in consultation with other role-players - in the
reduction of unemployment, poverty and inequality through policies and
programmes which are aimed at improved economic efficiency and
productivity.

It is one thing to have good Government policies - in this case, good
labour policies - but a different thing to have good implementation of the
policies. It becomes a question of good tools that remain unused or, if
used, used haphazardly. Let me start by referring to the statement made by
the hon the Minister of Labour on 3 August 1999 during a media briefing on
the implementation of the Jobs Summit agreements, which he repeated this
afternoon in this honourable House.

The hon the Minister, like millions of South Africans and in particular
Government employees, unionists and community representatives, expresses a
grave concern about the continued shedding of jobs throughout our economy.
He said, and I quote:


  Allow me at the outset to put to bed any simplistic notion that
  unemployment has somehow been caused by labour legislation.

  We all accepted last year that the financial crisis in the East was
  principally responsible for the falling of our currency.

The question I would like to ask the hon the Minister is: Why are the
unions continuously reacting with dismay to the Government's move to
implement the Jobs Summit agreements? In January 2000 the National Union of
Public Servants and Allied Workers said that the Government was engaged in
a move to undermine and ultimately get rid of statutory bargaining
structures. Nupsaw stated categorically that they were never engaged by
Government on any wage policy. What is the Government's position with
regard to this statement by Nupsaw?

The union went further to accuse the Government of conniving with some
unions in the implementation of labour policies without the consent and
knowledge of other unions. This is irreconcilable with the announcement
made by the hon the Minister during the briefing on the implementation of
the Jobs Summit agreements, and today, in this hon House. It cannot be
argued that the unions that made these statements are those which are not
affiliated to Cosatu, which is an ally of the ruling party.

Cosatu has also, on numerous occasions, publicly differed with the
Government and expressed dissatisfaction with the implementation of some
labour policies, in particular the Gear policy. Now, what are the hon the
Minister's plans to address these challenges, given the situation and
recognising that our economy, in this early stage of a profound transition,
faces the threat of a global economic crisis?

According to the social plan agreement between the department and other key
role-players, growth and job creation are urgent priorities and the social
plan approach aims to avoid job losses and employment decline. The UDM
welcomes and supports this statement. While one would welcome this move by
our hon Minister, the social plan approach - and in particular the social
plan technical support facility - which is aimed at exploring alternatives
to employment, as well as the establishment of retirement response teams
and other services, becomes irreconcilable. There is a continuous loss of
jobs without alternatives, in spite of the existence of the social plan
approach.

Reference was also made to the integrated provincial project which is
driven by the Department of Trade and Industry and which bring together
Government departments which are responsible for infrastructural
development. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the next speaker
will be making a maiden speech. Please give her the courtesy she deserves.
[Applause.]

Miss T E LISHIVHA: Chairperson, making the workplace safe and healthy for
workers is the basis of the occupational health discipline and is a mandate
given to the department.

This mandate excludes the health and safety of mineworkers. The main
objectives are, firstly, to promote the co-regulation of the management of
occupational health and safety in the industrial sector; secondly, to
address the backlog of accident investigation; and, thirdly, to develop a
career path for occupational health and safety inspectors, etc.

There is regulation by the department to ensure that health and safety
standards are implemented in the workplace, such as lead regulation,
facilities regulation, general safety regulation, etc. The workers must
have protective clothing, such as safety shoes, overalls, gloves, etc,
because everyone should work in a safe environment.

The total number of accidents, according to the industry, from 1995 to 1999
was only 120 which means that it is not the same as in previous years. This
number has decreased because the Government is now implementing the
regulations to force the industrial sector to use protective equipment.

Tshiven·∏ìa paragraph follows.)

[It does not mean that employers did not know that workers must be
protected. They did it deliberately. Today, the Government will ensure that
every employer protects his employees.]

The Constitution affords everyone the right to a healthy and safe
environment. Improving workers' health is still a major challenge facing
the country.

[That is why the present Government is pursuing a solution to the
carelessness of the previous employers who oppressed people whose products
they are now boasting about, and which shows that God does not forsake his
children. The Government has put in place people who will see to it that
there is safety and health standards in the workplace. They will also check
if the machines are fit for use. Indeed, many people have been disabled
because of injury by machines and other things at work. The present
Government is determined to stop that from happening again. What is also
worrying is that there is no compensation for injured people or to the next
of kin after a death on duty. The Government is putting in place
legislation that will cover all workers in the form of a compensation fund.

Our Government has investigated the possibility and made a follow-up so
that all workers in South Africa should be compensated. We also appeal for
good treatment of pregnant women, because they are mostly in employment
until the day of delivery. They are also expected to return to work after
no more than five days or less. This therefore means disregard of an
employee's health because she is still not fit to work.

We applaud our wise Government for having laws that ensure health care for
everyone. Anyone has that right because one does not differ from one's
employer. Let us all support our Government in its cause for health care of
people at work. If workers are ill and killed, there cannot be any
production. Forward with the support of this wise Government! The
Government has fought for people who suffered because of lack of human
rights.

We thank this department which has come up with laws for protecting
everyone in the workplace. [Applause.]]

Adv Z L MADASA: Mr Chairman, the Department of Labour has done very well in
putting in place a framework for skills development through the
establishment of various institutions and mechanisms. This is commended and
endorsed by the ACDP. Skills development is essential for the reduction of
unemployment. South Africa will only become a strong global player
economically when we have a sufficiently skilled labour source. The country
must invest in its people to ensure future economic growth.

``The Department of Labour is not an employer, but a provider of skills for
the Government,'' the director-general said when he briefed the labour
committee on the budget. However, personnel expenditure still accounts for
about 64,7% of the total budget. I would submit that taking into account
the stated function of the department, personnel expenditure is
unacceptably high. The director-general also hinted at the possibility of
overexpenditure on personnel because there are vacancies that have not been
filled. If this is the case, the Treasury instructions for full-cost
budgeting have been transgressed by the department. Improper budgeting is
tantamount to financial mismanagement.

The Minister of Finance, in his Budget speech, stated that budgeting has an
important part to play and is central to improving the quality of public
service. He also said:


  Although we must not forget that it is people who deliver services, we
  must also acknowledge that a better balance between personnel and
  nonpersonnel spending will improve the quality of the services we have to
  deliver.

The department, whose function - in the words of the director-general - it
is to provide skills, must reflect the balance that the Minister of Finance
referred to. Personnel expenditure must come down for speedy and efficient
service delivery, for the simple reason that the state does not have money.
The Department of Labour will not be able to contribute satisfactorily to
the overall stated aim of the Government, namely to improve service
delivery, unless personnel expenditure is reduced drastically. [Time

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, on behalf of the FF I would like to express
our congratulations to President Mbeki and the hon the Minister of Labour
on some of their positions regarding the illegal Volkswagen strike. If
things had gone wrong there, the message to the outside world would have
been very bad for South Africa.

Unemployment is South Africa's biggest problem. I am convinced that
unemployment is also the main cause of our totally unacceptable crime rate.
How do we solve it? By creating more jobs. It is as simple as that. But the
Government cannot create the jobs. The private sector must do that.

Broadly speaking, our economy is healthy and growing. Yet, no jobs are
being created. Why? I would venture to say that it is because of our labour
relations legislation. If I want to buy my family a new car, there are many
factors to consider. The most important is that I have five children. I
would like to buy myself a Porsche, but it has only two seats and is very
expensive. I would have to consider buying a Toyota Hi-Ace or a Volkswagen
Microbus.
After 1994, the ANC Government went and bought itself a Porsche as far as
labour legislation is concerned, most probably because of Cosatu's
influence. Modern legislation based on European models is heavily weighted
in the workers' favour, but the European labour markets are Porsches while
we need a Toyota Hi-Ace in South Africa.

In South Africa we lose more jobs daily than we create. Between 1975 and
1994, R5,7¬†billion was invested in industrial technology by employers, that
is automatisation.

In Europa het die getal werkers die afgelope 20 jaar bykans konstant gebly.
In sommige lande het die getal werkers selfs verminder en hul wetgewing is
daarvoor geskryf. In Amerika is die situasie nader aan die Suid-frikaanse
een, waar 'n mens groot getalle nuwe werkers het wat die arbeidsmark betree
en daar mededinging in die werkplek is, asook groot getalle ongeskoolde
arbeiders.

Die Regering het ges√™ hy gaan kyk na die arbeidswetgewing ten einde die
onvoorsiene gevolge daarvan te verbeter. Hierna moet gekyk word, want ons
het 'n Porsche en ons kort 'n Toyota. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[In Europe the number of workers has remained almost the same over the past
20 years. In some countries the number of workers has even decreased and
their legislation was written for that purpose. In America the situation is
closer to that of South Africa, where one has large numbers of new workers
entering the job market and where there is competition in the workplace, as
well as large numbers of unskilled labourers.

The Government has said that it would be examining labour legislation in
order to improve on unforeseen consequences. This must be looked at,
because we have a Porsche and what we need is a Toyota. [Time expired.]]

Ms L A ABRAHAMS: Mr Chairman, as South Africa's young economy is catapulted
into the 21st century, it faces major economic and social challenges and
constraints. The poor skills profile within South Africa is one such
constraint and is likely to act as a brake on growth.

The skills development strategy does not claim that skills on their own
will deliver economic and employment growth in our country, as skills
development is not simply about preparing people to perform routine tasks
in an unchanging environment, but also about empowering people to perform
at a high standard, where standards are measured by their appropriateness
for a specified period whilst dynamic social and economic purposes are
achieved.

Skills development is an area which in the past was neglected. Apartheid
planners invested in infrastructure and a small minority. This legacy is
still felt today. Through the skills development programme and the
transformation embarked on since 1994, our society is being transformed in
order to deal with the legacy.

The skills development programme will create an ideal setting for
industrial growth that abounds with opportunities in every sector of our
economy. Minister Tito Mboweni, in the foreword of the Green Paper on
skills development, said, and I quote:


  This strategy aims to set in motion a skills revolution in our country
  and nothing less than a revolution will suffice when one considers the
  urgent need for employment and productivity growth in our country.

The need for the programme cannot be overemphasised. South Africa has been
rated as having one of the poorest human resource development records in
the world. The poor quality of basic education and the systematic exclusion
of black South Africans from decent training opportunities are major
contributors to this. There has been a serious failure to address middle-
level skills requirements in our society. We see the decline in the
apprenticeship system and the failure to put anything in its place.

Skills shortages at these and higher levels constrain productivity growth
within enterprises and limit the self-employment or employment options of
individuals. The level of industrial training in South Africa is much lower
than that of our major trading partners. The sectors in which most of our
growth and employment opportunities are likely to occur in the future spend
less on skills development than the national average.

Most industry training is informal. A very small portion of formal training
is provided to lower-level workers. There is a failure on the part of firms
to recognise the importance of training within the new competitive
environment and the need for training to be strategically integrated into
their competitive strategies. These legacies and the huge challenges facing
South Africa in terms of employment, growth and development demand a new
conceptual approach to skills development. The overall vision is of a human
resource development system which promotes economic and employment growth
and social development through a focus on education, training and
employment services. The approach does not suggest that the supply side of
the system should be disregarded or neglected, but rather that it should be
improved within the context of demand-led training.

The low skills base is one of the reasons for the low levels of investment
in our country. General schooling and the good efforts of individual
companies or industries are insufficient to turn this situation around. It
requires national intervention to strengthen the link between workplace
education, training, economic growth and employment opportunities. There is
a critical need to manage the dislocation caused by structural change, to
eliminate institutional impediments to employment creation and to hasten
the process towards a sustainable, inclusive labour force. International
evidence suggests a need to focus on investment in human development,
including education, training and basic welfare. The key to achieving
higher employment rates lies in unlocking the structural barriers to labour
absorption.

The social partners and other stakeholders have lent their support to this.
The major challenge, however, will be to implement the institutional
arrangements needed for execution. Putting South Africa on a developmental
and employment-absorbing growth path is a long-term challenge which will
only become reality if the partnership between business, labour and
Government is continued. We have already reached milestones in
transformation with key victories such as the passing and implementation of
the Labour Relations Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the
Employment Equity Act, the Skills Development Act and the Skills
Development Levies Act.

I want to take this opportunity to commend the department on their
achievement with regard to the skills programme. The National Skills
Authority, which is made up of stakeholders, the National Skills Fund and a
skills planning unit within the department, has been established. The
department has driven extensive preparations with stakeholders in order to
set up 26 sector and education training authorities. A funding regulation
outlining how firms can claim back grants from levies paid was published in
February.

Significant progress has been made in the implementation of learnerships,
including a pilot project in KwaZulu-Natal and the launch of a tourism
sector initiative funded by the Department of Labour and the Business
Trust, which will result in 15 000 learnerships.

I would like to thank the Ministry for extending its obligation to
establish and enforce ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before I call the next
speaker, I must ask the hon Mpontshane and the hon Peter Smith please to
pay attention to the debate. [Laughter.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, I want firstly to
congratulate the hon T E Lishivha on her maiden speech.

In South Africa the informal economy does matter. It encompasses all
economic activities pursued without the sanction of the authorities, that
is those that are not recorded in the national accounts. The market
efficiency in the informal sector is determined by the availability of
labour and resources. Most of us have implicitly assumed that unrecorded
economic activity is a good thing. This view is not universally accepted.
The degree of involvement of informal economic activities does not
necessarily complement the formal economic sector.

An informal producer may supply goods to a capitalist at a low price. This
allows the capitalist to pay lower wages to his or her workers, thus
increasing the rate of exploitation. The freedom from red tape is a mixed
blessing. Some informal activities impose substantial external costs on
society. For example, the vending of foodstuffs may increase the risk of
epidemic disease. Furthermore, the employee may be subjected to poor
working conditions which can increase the risk of occupational disease and
accidents. In the event of exploitation, most often legal resources against
the employer prove to be difficult and expensive.

The informal economy serves as a buffer against unemployment. Owing to the
lack of information, it is clear that the policy-making for the informal
sector is complex. Therefore survey data in estimating the nature and
extent of the labour force in participating in the hidden economy is a
necessity. What is problematic in South Africa is that in the past many
nonwhite citizens were forced to confine themselves to specific regions.
Consequently, a discrepancy in per capita income was a result of political
distortions imposed on the economy. Therefore there is an enormous
difference in production capacity and standards of living between rural and
urban South Africans.

One of the most important implications for policy to consider today is the
result of previous attempts to keep the disadvantaged out of the major
urban areas. However, we must also consider that the nature of the current
education system and limitations on the acquisition of skills have a
negative impact on the economy. This has resulted in most of the national
labour force being unskilled.

Although income redistribution between whites and the historically
disadvantaged has taken place, this redistribution has not necessarily been
equally shared. On the whole it is the skilled nonwhite labour force that
has benefited from the economic transformation. The unskilled labour force
is still suffering. Amendment of the Labour Relations Act is necessary to
eliminate the enormous backlogs in the CCMA in order to empower arbitrators
to mediate and pass meaningful and legitimate awards to wronged employees
and employers, which will reduce the backlog in labour courts.

Unfortunately, the present labour system is being exploited by unscrupulous
entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs exploit employees by exhausting the
companies' disciplinary and grievance procedure in courts. The companies'
main aim with this attitude is to manipulate and take full advantage of the
huge backlogs at the CCMA.

Due to the lengthy waiting period of the present labour legal resource
system, some aggrieved employees do not have the moral stamina to pursue
their cases. This unfortunately works to the advantage of the company.
Arbitration with teeth will eliminate the daunting challenge to employees
of having to go through the unnecessary phases of labour law and process.

The Employment Equity Act, although promulgated, is not implemented to its
fullest capacity. The unemployment equity commission which should have been
in place has not yet materialised. Many companies, more especially in the
private sectors have just recently started forming employment equity
committees, which definitely ... [Time expired.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, arbeid is 'n emosionele en 'n baie
sensitiewe saak in enige land, en soveel te meer in 'n land soos Suid-
Afrika waar ons staan in 'n proses van transformasie. Voeg daarby die feit
dat georganiseerde arbeid een van die vennote in die regeringskoalisie is,
en die saak raak nog meer ingewikkeld. Voeg daarby die groot
werkloosheidsyfer in ons land, waaruit blyk dat elke arbeidsgeleentheid 'n
skaars en gesogte kommoditeit is, en ons besef dat nie die ideologiese nie,
maar die ekonomiese oorwegings hier voorrang moet geniet.

In sy presidentsrede het die agb mnr Mbeki aangedui dat sekere aspekte van
die arbeidswetgewing onvoorsiene nadelige gevolge inhou. Hy het aangekondig
dat 'n hersiening daarvan in die vooruitsig gestel word. Die grootste
onvoorsiene gevolg is die kontraproduktiewe effek van hierdie wette.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, labour is an emotional and very sensitive
matter in any country, and even more so in a country such as South Africa,
where we are engaged in a process of transformation. In addition, organised
labour is one of the partners in the government coalition and hence the
matter becomes even more complicated. In addition to that, we have a very
high unemployment rate in our country, and consequently every job
opportunity is a scarce and sought-after commodity, which makes us realise
that not ideological ideas, but economic considerations, should receive
priority in this regard.

In his presidential address the hon Mr Mbeki indicated that certain aspects
of the labour legislation have unforeseen detrimental effects. He announced
that its revision is being envisaged. The most important unforeseen
consequence is the counterproductive effect of these laws.]

I must say ``unforeseen'' in inverted commas, because different opposition
parties did actually foresee these so-called unforeseen consequences of our
labour laws.

Die arbeidswette wat by uitstek die werker wil beskerm, is
kontraproduktief. Wetgewing maak die arbeidskommoditeit so duur en
onbekostigbaar dat eerder oorgeskakel word na kapitaalintensiewe as
arbeidsintensiewe ondernemings. Die gevolg: groter werkloosheid.

Rekonstruksie vind plaas sodat die status van werkers van voltydse
werknemers na tydelike kontrakwerkers met minder voordele verander word.
Regstellende aksie in die werkplek kom neer op gewettigde diskriminasie met
gevolglike verlies aan kundigheid, ervaring en produktiwiteit. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The labour legislation aimed pre-eminently at the protection of the worker
is counterproductive. As a result of legislation the labour commodity is so
expensive and unaffordable that we have changed over to capital-intensive
rather than labour-intensive enterprises. The result: more unemployment.

Reconstruction takes place so that the status of workers is changed from
that of full-time workers to that of part-time contract workers with fewer
benefits. Affirmative action in the workplace is tantamount to legalised
discrimination, with a consequent loss of competence, experience and
productivity.]
The AEB is of the opinion that to approach a better labour dispensation,
attempts must be made to achieve the following goals. The structuring of a
more flexible labour market should encourage employers to employ, not to
retrench. Adversarialism in the workplace should be reduced and co-
operation and joint decision-making encouraged.

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: How do we do that?

Mr C AUCAMP: That is the hon the Minister's job. Every employee's job
security should be protected as far as possible, and the rights of minority
unions should be protected. Greater emphasis should be placed on the
constitutional right of every employee to freedom of association. With
these goals in mind, the AEB proposes, inter alia, the following amendments
to existing labour laws, and I will concentrate only on the Employment
Equity Act.

Only affirmative-action programmes in terms of Chapter 3 of the Act may be
considered to be so-called fair discrimination. The current wording is too
wide and open to abuse by employers. Chapter 3 of the Act should
specifically prohibit any type of affirmative action that establishes an
absolute barrier to the employment of persons from nondesignated groups.
This Chapter should also place an obligation on an employer to ensure that
affirmative measures are implemented in a manner that is least likely to
unreasonably limit the rights of employees from nondesignated groups. It
should also prohibit the dismissal of employees as a measure to obtain a
more representative workforce. The composition of the Commission for
Employment Equity should be revised to include a representative from
nondesignated groups.

Verder moet dit in gedagte gehou word dat die nuwe wet op gelyke
indiensneming werknemers uit nie-aangewese groepe feitlik per definisie
uitsluit sodat hulle geen beskerming geniet nie. Die Wet op
Arbeidsbetrekkinge sal ek daar laat weens 'n gebrek aan tyd.

Samevattend wil ek s√™ die ho√´ en toenemende werkloosheidsyfer in Suid-
Afrika onderstreep die feit dat ideologies gedrewe ingrepe en
regeringsmanipulering van die arbeidsmark besig is om te boemerang teen
hulle wat veronderstel is om daaruit bevoordeel te word. Alleen die
privaatsektor kan deur ekonomiese groei die oplossing bied vir
werkloosheid. Ons moet die markkragte toelaat om hulle natuurlike rol te
speel, en die massale vlak van armoede, waartoe werkloosheid die grootste
bydrae lewer, sal op natuurlike wyse die hoof gebied word. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the new Act on equal employment
virtually by definition excludes employees from non-designated groups so
that they do not enjoy any protection. I shall not discuss the Labour
Relations Act owing to the fact that my time is limited.

I want to summarise by saying that the high and increasing rate of
unemployment in South Africa underlines the fact that ideologically-driven
interventions and Government manipulation of the labour market are starting
to boomerang on those people who are supposed to benefit from them. Only
the private sector can, by means of economic growth, solve the problem of
unemployment. We must allow the market forces to play their natural role,
and the massive rate of poverty, in respect of which unemployment is the
largest contributing factor, will be rectified in a natural way.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the next speaker,
M J G Mzondeki, will be speaking from his seat. [Applause.]

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Chair, hon members, when the then Minister of Labour
presented the Green Paper on Skills Development Strategy for Economic and
Employment Growth in South Africa, he said:


  It aims to set in motion a skills revolution in our country, and nothing
  less than a skills revolution will suffice when one considers the urgent
  need for employment and productivity growth in our country.

He further said:


  This strategy does not claim that the development of skills on its own
  will achieve these objectives, but it argues that skilled people are a
  fundamentally necessary part of any economic employment growth strategy.

In pursuit of this objective, the Department of Labour is implementing a
skills development programme. The passing of the Skills Development Act of
1998 and the Skills Development Levies Act of 1999 laid a foundation for
this programme to take its course. The purpose of these Acts is not only to
improve the quality of life of workers but also to improve the prospects of
the previously disadvantaged to enter the labour market as well as to
redress those disadvantages through training and education. It is also
aimed at assisting work-seekers to find work and retrenched workers to re-
enter the labour market.

I speak on behalf of the Free State Goldfields constituency where workers
are not only hit by the gold-bearing rock, but are also hard-hit by the
retrenchments. Allow me then to say that amongst those hit the hardest by
the pass laws of apartheid are people with disabilities. This is truly
because they were not only denied education, but they were also denied an
opportunity to learn through exposure to the working environment, because,
as many of us will know, there was no dedicated skills programme, and we
learnt through our experiences in the work environment.

Many disabled people were injured on the mines in mining accidents while
digging gold under the worst conditions and subject to poor safety
standards. I say this, having worked on the mines both underground and on
the surface myself for the better part of my life. Because there were no
skills development programmes or labour laws that protected people from
being repatriated when they were declared unfit for one category of
employment, most of those disabled workers saw their way home without
compensation and without, at least, any skills to fend for themselves. And
it is against this background that I fully support the Department of Labour
in embarking on this skills development programme.

The few that remained on the mines were placed on the lowest category of
jobs - such as cleaners, general labourers, and so on - even though some of
them, through exposure at work, had risen to supervisory levels. Hon
members will know that some of us were called amabaasboy [baasboys]. We had
the responsibility of digging gold from underground, but when some of us
became disabled they were placed in those lower-category jobs. Today these
workers are able to challenge these unfair dismissals through the
provisions of the Labour Relations Act, but more so, they can go home and
move to other SETAS equipped with skills. I say this because in the
constituency where I come from, already mineworkers have benefited from the
social plan. I acknowledge that not enough is being done; there is still
room to improve the social plan to benefit more people. Many disabled
mineworkers who were retrenched in the Free State Goldfields have for the
first time, through the implementation of the social plan, been able to go
home equipped with skills.

Allow me also to focus on some of the initiatives by the Department of
Labour to empower the previously disadvantaged. The Department of Labour is
embarking on the transformation of the so-called sheltered employment
factories. There are 13 of them in the country, R18 million is budgeted for
them and they employ 1 500 disabled people. There are concerns about this
scheme, which was initially intended to accommodate disabled people as they
were, at the time, discriminated against and were not allowed into the
labour market.

The problem is that of that 1 500, only 460 are black people. The rest,
about 1 000, are white people. If one looks at the geographic spread of
those centres, one finds that it does not benefit the most disadvantaged,
ie the disabled people in the rural areas, which is why I support the
initiative of the department to seriously embark upon the transformation
process of these schemes. There is no dedicated plan at these centres:
while some of the people might be able to exit from these centres into the
labour market, it is not as a result of a dedicated plan, but of exposure
to the work environment.

I thus fully support the Minister in embarking on this transformation
process. Also, this is undermining the principle indicated in the
Integrated Disability Strategy, which proposes that disabled people be
integrated into the labour market. If one looks at these schemes, one finds
that they are putting disabled people in some corner and that is against
the principle, as I said, proposed in the Integrated Disability Strategy.

In conclusion, I want to thank the Minister of Labour for his commitment to
ensuring an enabling environment for all to access jobs, and his staff for
their commitment to turning the labour centres into client-friendly
centres. [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Deputy Chairperson, Minister of Labour, Ministers of state
and Deputy Ministers present in the Chamber, hon members, three weeks from
now workers the world over will celebrate their famous Workers' Day: famous
in the sense that they will be celebrating the fruits of their labour in
the past 12 months, realised individually and collectively.
Their profits are practical and valuable. They enrich the heart, calm the
mind and console the spirit. They cause the workers to want to produce more
and better, behave onerously and love management even more in another 12
months to come. At the end of my address, I am going to support the Vote on
Labour on behalf of my party if I am not cut short by that pronouncement:
``Time has expired''. [Laughter.]

What is it that workers in South Africa will celebrate on 1 May 2000 in the
face of the present state of our economy, which is stagnating or shrinking?
Are the workers going to celebrate the many thousands of jobs lost in the
labour market? Are they going to celebrate the threat of many more jobs
still to be lost in the mines, manufacturing sector, Public Service and
agriculture? Staff shortages in some departments are alarming, and one
would not like to expose the statistics. While staff is short, the workload
is shared among serving personnel at the cost of efficiency and morale. Is
that what the workers will celebrate next month?

While the principle of taxi recapitalisation is welcomed to a mild degree,
what about the jobs to be lost in the process by taxi owners, spare parts
manufacturers, taxi drivers and cleaners? There is no logic in the theory
that one should shed many jobs in order to create many more jobs, as some
pundits would like us to believe. Workers in the industry have no cause to
celebrate, but to mourn the prospects of losing their jobs in thousands.

Unemployment is a devil on the throat of society. It is a scourge eating
into the fibre and morale of men and women, young and old. It manifests
itself in crime, abject poverty, illiteracy and behaviour that is unknown
to humankind. While the country is steeped in such crisis of unprecedented
unemployment, workers do not find cause to celebrate but to group and
regroup, crying over the economy that stifles the budget for Labour.

We saw workers flexing their muscles against the previous regime. We saw
how telling their blow was to the system that strangled their freedom, and
we better sound a warning against misdirected worker power if concerns
about economic growth remain a pie in the sky.

Yes, the IFP also supports Vote 19 - luckily, I have not been cut short!
But the IFP has concerns about the incentive package that is shoddy and
unable to make South Africa an attractive investment destination over other
developing nations. Despite all the explanations given in the budget
summary on employment and skills development services, nothing satisfies
the mind if this year's allocation is slashed by 32,5%. Workers will find
it difficult to celebrate this decrease.

Ms H F MALEBANA: Mr Chairperson and hon members, on 27 April 1994, millions
of workers woke up very early in the morning. But on that day they were not
going to their normal exploitative workplaces. They were not going to the
bosses, who were always in the offices planning the fate of the overworked
workers. On the dawn of that day, they were going to the polls to cast
their vote.

Ba be ba ile gore go beng me≈°omo: Go lekane lehono, ge le le dinkwe, rena,
bjalo ka ba≈°omi, re mapogo. [They were going to say to the employers:
Enough is enough.]

Why this excitement? The poor workers knew that, on that day, their cross
would wipe the tears from their eyes and the sweat from their foreheads,
and also clean up their blood, as some of them were beaten or even killed
for their labour. They woke up, knowing that, as from that day, the cross
they had made - a right they were denied for centuries - was going to usher
new meaning into their lives. The party they were going to elect was going
to take the heavy load from their shoulders.

In 1956, H S Erasmus, an MP during NP rule said, and I quote:


  It is most desirable that all young natives, say between 15 and 16 years
  of age, be placed in youth camps so that they can do land service and do
  it gratis. There they must be taught to work with a pick and shovel
  because they will need this knowledge in their lives.


As one listens to some members of the Opposition and reads newspaper
articles written by them, one hears echoes of Erasmus. They try to entrench
child labour and dehumanise farmworkers who, as we know, work in extremely
squalid and appalling conditions under oppressive farmers who can only be
described as brutal and brutish in the extreme. In the past, our workers
were not allowed to form unions. As a result, they were subject to the
whims of their employers.

Molaotheo wa Afrika-Borwa o ≈°irelet≈°a ba≈°omi. Wona o re ga go motho yo a
swanet≈°ego go ≈°omiswa bjalo ka lekgoba, goba go ≈°omi≈°wa ka kgapelet≈°o. Bana

[The Constitution of South Africa protects workers, and it provides that no
one may be subjected to slavery, servitude or forced labour. Children too
should not be forced to work unless they are above 15 years of age. Every
child has a right not to be required to or permitted to perform work or
provide services that are inappropriate for a person of that child's age,
that might result in their injury or consequences that might impact
negatively on their future.]

The Department of Labour has the interests of workers at heart, and
therefore bends over backwards in trying to change people's lives for the
better. When we therefore say that we are a nation at work trying to create
a better life for all, we include the Department of Labour. The department
has initiated and implemented legislation enabling the promotion of sound
and stable relations in the workplace, the protection of the rights of
workers and employers and the provision of a range of services to thousands
of citizens, including those in the remotest parts of this country, the
jobless and the vulnerable, especially domestic and farmworkers.

Government's commitment to the protection and safeguarding of workers'
rights started with the RDP document. It stressed basic organisational
rights for all workers, such as them being able to join the union of their
choice, workers' entitlement to a living wage and collective bargaining
power at national and industrial level, as well as at their workplace, so
as to give them a say in decision-making. Affirmative action was introduced
to address discrimination in companies.

These actions culminated in the Government's passing of the Employment
Equity Act and the Skills Development Act. The Employment Equity Act seeks
to achieve equality in the workplace, to ensure the promotion of equal
opportunities for all workers and to eliminate unfair discrimination. It
also ensures that discrimination against women and the disabled are
addressed. The Skills Development Act promotes the training of these
workers. The Labour Relations Act strengthens the organisational rights of
workers. It promotes centralised bargaining councils and protects workers
against dismissal in legal strikes. The Labour Relations Act also covers
those workers who were previously excluded, namely domestic and farmworkers
and public servants.

A number of statutory bodies were established to ensure that workers are
treated fairly, and that their labour is recognised. These include the
Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, the Labour Court,
the National Skills Authority and the Sectoral Education and Training
Authorities.

The CCMA plays an active role in ensuring that disputes are resolved
amicably. In order to fulfil its objectives, the department has to ensure
that it functions effectively and that it strengthens the CCMA. The Labour
Court has to be adequately resourced in order for it to fulfil its
functions. We welcome the increase in this programme.

The department also has to develop the National Skills Authority and to
ensure that Sectoral Education and Training Authorities are built in order
to train the previously disadvantaged and vulnerable workers into an
effective and employable labour force.

The Labour Relations Act has enhanced organisational rights for trade
unions as entrenched in the Constitution. It has also entrenched the
constitutional right to strike, simplified dispute resolution procedures,
promoted sectoral collective bargaining and codified dismissal procedures.
Nevertheless, there are problems and unintended consequences.

In the ANC's 1999 election manifesto, the President said:


  Our central challenge for the next five years is to use the experience we
  gained, the policies we have put into place and institutions of democracy
  we have created to bring about even greater change than we have achieved
  in the first five years of democratic government.

This will have to be realised, as we are saying that there are flaws in the
Labour Relations Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, and that
we need to deal with that in order to correct them. This only means that
certain sections within the laws have to be amended.

Section 23 of the Constitution says: ``Everyone has the right to fair
labour practices.'' This applies to all workers, and it must be obeyed by
all employers and employees. It also regulates working hours, overtime, and
maternity leave. The Basic Conditions of Employment Act also sets
conditions for what must happen when an employer, owing to operational
requirements, has to terminate an employee's service.

Tshepedi≈°o le phethagat≈°o ya molao wo, e dirwa ke bahlahlobi ba me≈°omo.
Bona ba fiwa maatla a go nyaki≈°i≈°a le go hlahloba dillo t≈°a ba≈°omi; go
bot≈°i≈°a batho ka ga me≈°omo le dingwalwa le dibuka t≈°a beng-me≈°omo. [The
implementation of this Act is supervised by labour inspectors, who are
authorised to enquire into and attend to employees' grievances, to assess
the work done by employees and to check employers' records.]

This Vote seeks to ensure that productive employment opportunities are
opened up for new work-seekers. It will also help to improve the
effectiveness of labour markets by investing more in skills development and
training. This, of course, will be achieved through the Skills Development
Act and the Skills Development Levies Act. Both these Acts attempt to
strengthen the link between workplace education and training, and economic
growth and employment opportunities.

The 15-point programme of action of the department gives the intention and
vision of the department for the creation of a labour market that is
conducive to economic growth. The department is committed to playing a
significant role in the reduction of unemployment, poverty and
inequalities.

These Acts, in partnership with the Vote, will help curb the low rate of
the creation of productive employment, inefficient utilisation of labour
owing to discriminatory practices and the denial of fair labour standards
to the majority of the workers.

I would like urge the Minister to proceed and tell him that we support the
Vote. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N S BRUCE: Chairperson, in early February hon President Thabo Mbeki
announced that the hon Minister of Labour had led a review of labour market
legislation to remove the unintended consequences of the Labour Relations
Act, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Insolvency Act. He said
that these unintended consequences arose from the contrasting claims of
fair labour practice and the fostering of economic growth sufficient to
create jobs. The President said that the Minister of Labour had not only
already interacted with Nedlac on this matter, but he would also introduce
changes this year.

The number of unemployed has continued to rise and will still rise further.
The rand has continued to fall, and will continue to fall further, while
the growth which the economy is experiencing now, as a result of commodity
price increases and not Government policy, is not enough to arrest either
of these two morbid trends.

The hon the Minister has this afternoon described the working of markets in
disturbingly inaccurate caricature. Markets fail if the Government places
impediments in their way. Governments who do not take notice of markets
have failed everywhere. The United States is a profit-driven country and
one of the most free and most humane in the world. [Interjections.] By
contrast, Cuba or China, countries that are driven by compulsion and fear,
are characterised by inhumanity and poverty as a result. [Interjections.]

Ever since the President's remarks on the labour laws, the hon the Minister
of Labour has been prevaricating. He knows that fixed capital investment is
vital to job creation. He knows that investors are, with reason, sceptical
of our labour laws. He answers them with an ill-informed attack on market
economics, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. He has
done enormous harm this afternoon to this country's investment prospects.
[Interjections.]

Apart from growing queues of jobless, the urgency of these labour law
reforms has been illustrated by the plight of one of Government's own
businesses, the South African Airways. It wants full exemption from the
Basic Conditions of Employment Act. When the hon the Minister confronts
this request, he will be caught between the intemperate trade unions
demanding more laws, and the ambitious young American Republican running
SAA, Mr Coleman Andrews, whom Government appointed, demanding fewer laws.
What is the hon the Minister going to sacrifice - trade union votes or the
jobs that a profitable company will generate? He is going to need the
wisdom of Solomon to solve this problem, and, quite frankly, from what he
said about economics this afternoon, he does not have it. [Laughter.]

If a company the size of SAA cannot operate profitably, burdened by our
labour laws, what hope have medium to small companies - the very companies
that are able to create more jobs and quickly at that? The hon the
Minister's own President has told him that labour reforms are necessary. Mr
Andrews has given him an example and yet the Minister, vexed by the fact
that he understands neither, claims to speak under inspiration. The
Minister would have, would he not, for he has let go of facts. Perhaps what
he meant was not inspiration, but perspiration. What he said was banal in
the extreme. The DP cannot support a budget that underpins a policy that
creates unemployment. [[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, last week I
attended two workshops, on skills development and levies, one in Gauteng
and one in Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. Both workshops were attended with the
full capacity of the attendants. The participants in these workshops were
mainly representatives from business.

What I understood from what they were saying in those workshops - all of
them without exception - was that they were grateful that at last, in South
Africa, the Government was taking education and training seriously and was
beginning to link the two. They were saying that with this approach and
this move, the productivity and quality of products in South Africa would
improve. They said that this would bring about better investment in South
Africa and that it would increase the confidence of investors in South
Africa.

I wondered, as I was sitting here listening to the speakers, mainly from
the DP and one speaker from the New NP, whom they represent. All along I
was under the impression that the DP represents big business. But, today, I
concluded that they represent themselves. [Applause.] Today, I concluded
that the New NP - those that are here - represent themselves. Perhaps, this
answers the question of why the NP came into power in 1948, lost that power
in 1994 and further lost power in 1999. Perhaps this answers this question,
since they are not representing any constituency. [Applause.] I want to
believe that the same thing applies to the DP. Their support is declining.
They will see in the next elections. [Interjections.] [Applause.]
An HON MEMBER: Siyanda. [We are increasing.]

Mr M A MAPHALALA: That is wishful thinking. The few things that the
opposition has said here clearly indicate their interests. Secondly, this
probably tells us about the composition of this House, that perhaps members
on the Government side and few members on the opposition side - if I had
time I would name those parties - are simply talking to themselves because,
no matter how much one argues with the opposition here, they are not going
to listen. There is no reason that will bring them back to their senses.
[Interjections.]

We are talking about the Vote of the Department of Labour. Their concern is
mainly that the Government wants to remove laws that make human beings in
South Africa slaves. They say that they want to maintain that. They are
talking of labour inflexibility. I would want to understand what that
labour inflexibility is that they are talking about. [Interjections.] It is
labour inflexibility to say that workers must be able to join organisations
of their choice. It is labour inflexibility to say that there must be a
minimum wage in South Africa. That is labour inflexibility, because they
want to have people who will slave for them. They want people to work for
R100 per month. That is what they want. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: How many jobs have you lost?

Mr M A MAPHALALA: I have lost so many jobs precisely because of that kind
of approach of that member. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr M A MAPHALALA: Chairperson, there is a gentleman who is said to be an MP
of the DP. I am not very sure whether it is the hon Bruce that was standing
here before me. But in a newspaper of 27 ...

An HON MEMBER: Which one?

Mr M A MAPHALALA: It does not matter. I will tell you later. Do not worry.
He says that colonialism did not bring apartheid to South Africa.
[Interjections.] He says colonialism and apartheid did not create suffering
for Africans in South Africa, blacks in particular. [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr M A MAPHALALA: He says that it is the inferiority of blacks that makes
blacks suffer in South Africa. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr M A MAPHALALA: I wonder where such a type of person comes from. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

UMPHATHISWA WEZABASEBENZI: Mhlalingaphambili, mandibulele kakhulu
kuMaphalala. Ndicinga ukuba uyiphalaze kakuhle le nyewe, akukho mfuneko ke
yokuba ndibe ndizikhathaza ngale nkothovu yexhego ingu-Bruce ...
[Kwahlekwa] ... eliqiqisholwana elibonakalayo ukuba libufanarha nenkuba-
bulongo. [Kwahlekwa.] Ngoko ke andinakuzixakekisa ngaye.

Mandiwabulele kakhulu amalungu ekomiti yesebe lolawulo. Ndiva int' embi
ngokuba umhlalingaphambili wekomiti yesebe lolawulo abe akabanga nakho
ukuba nathi namhlanje. Siva ukuba uye waya kutyandwa esibhedlele.
Simnqwenelela impilo entle uSalie Manie. Kwakhona ndifuna ukubulela
kuMlawuli-Jikelele weSebe lezaBasebenzi kunye neqela lakhe ngomsebenzi
omhle kangaka abawenzayo kweli sebe.

Mandiwabulele onke amalungu athe athabatha inxaxheba kule ngxoxo namhlanje.
Noko akukhange kutake zintlantsi. Bendiba i-DP iza kuza nento entsha.
Ngelishwa ke namalungu azivele ukuba akukho nto intsha iza nayo. Iseyilaa
DP iza nalaa nto indala, indyengelele yedlwebhe-dlwebhe lomhluzi
ongacacanga. [Kwahlekwa.] Ngoko ke akukho mfuneko yokuzihlupha kakhulu
ngabantu abafana ne-DP.

KuMnu Bakker, ndifuna ukuthi nje kuye ifani yam nguMdladlana, ngoko ke
ndiyacela kwinkosi yam le ukuba xa indibiza ingathi ndinguMadladlana.
[Kwahlekwa.] Andinguye uMadladlana ndinguMdladlana. [Kwahlekwa.]
Akanakuthanda naye xa ndinokuthi ifani yakhe nguBhakilisi. [Kwahlekwa.] Uya
kufuna ukuba ndimbize ngendlela eyiyo. Mabazifunde iilwimi zethu aba bafana
kuba basebancinci, basibize ngendlela eyiyo, ukuze baze kukhula kakuhle
ngoba ingcinezelo ye-NP yenza ukuba iingqondo zabo zithwangazele. [Uwele-
wele.]

Intetho yam yomhla we-17 kuMatshi e-Germiston ibhaliwe. Amalungu ale Ndlu
amele i-DP angayifumana xa eyifuna. Into endingazi kuyenza kukufela
ubudenge nobuyatha bentatheli ye-Business Report bokudala impixano ngenxa
yengqondo yayo engakwaziyo ukukhongozela kakuhle. Kutheni le nto ubuhiba
nobuyatha bayo bubuzwa kum?

Kamnandi ke uHeremiya uyayithetha le nto athi: ``Umntu ngamnye uya kuma
yedwa phambi koThixo wakhe aziphendulele ngokwakhe.'' Ndiya kuzifela ke
ezam izono, kodwa andisayi kufela izono zentatheli ye-Business Report.

ILUNGU ELIHLONIPHEKILEYO: Amen! [Kwahlekwa.]

UMPHATHISWA: Ngoko ke, ohloniphekileyo uRudi Heine ukhangeleka ngathi
utyibilikela ngakule nkalo sendiyizobe ngasentla yokukhangeleka eheshe-
heshe apha entloko. Andinqweneli ke ukuntywila kwelo chibi labantu
abashiywa ziingqondo.

Mandigqibele ngokubuza kohloniphekileyo uRudi Heine ... (Translation of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Let me truly thank hon Mr Maphalala. I think that
he delivered what was said properly. There is, therefore, no need for me to
bother myself about this ancient old man by the name of Bruce ...
[Laughter] ... this prophet of doom who is obviously almost similar to a
dungbeetle.  [Laughter.] I therefore cannot keep myself occupied with him.

Let me truly thank the portfolio committee members. It is a pity that the
chairperson of the portfolio committee could not be with us today. We heard
that he has gone to hospital to undergo an operation. We wish Mr Salie
Manie well. I also want to thank the Director-General of the Department of
Labour and his team for the sterling work they are doing here.

Let me thank all the members who participated in this debate today. No
sparks flew, though. I thought the DP would come up with something new.
Unfortunately, they did not come up with anything new. The members heard
for themselves. It is still the DP bringing the same old thing, a weak,
unappetising, flavourless sauce. [Laughter.] So, there is no need for one
to bother oneself too much about people like the members of the DP.

I just want to say to Mr Bakker that my surname is Mdladlana. I therefore
ask this `chief ' of mine not to refer to me as `madladlana' when
mentioning my surname. [Laughter.] I am not `madladlana', I am Mdladlana.
[Laughter.] He, also, would not like it if I refer to him as `bakilisi'
when mentioning his surname.[Laughter.] He would want me to pronounce his
surname properly. These young men must learn our language because they are
still young. In order to come right they must pronounce our names in a
proper manner, because the NP oppression caused their mentality to wander.

My speech of 17 March in Germiston has been recorded. It is available if
the DP members of this House need it. I am not going to allow myself to be
sacrificed because of the stupidity and simpleness of the Business Report
journalist in engineering conflict, owing to the inability of his brain to
collect properly. Why is the idiocy and the stupidity of the journalist
asked of me?

What is nice is that Jeremiah mentions this and says:


  Each and every person will stand alone before his Lord and give account.

So, I am going to pay the price for my own sins, but I am not going to be
sacrificed for the sins of a Business Report journalist.

An HON MEMBER: Amen!

The MINISTER: Therefore, the hon Rudi Heine appears to be drifting towards
being someone who seems to be mentally disturbed, as already sketched out
above. I do not wish to sink in the morass of people who are out of their
minds.

Let me end by asking the hon Rudi Heine ....

... is he suggesting that employers be given a free right to exploit
workers and to expose them to inhuman conditions with impunity? Is he
suggesting that laws passed by this Parliament be treated with disdain?

The inspectors of the department do not see their role as that of policing
employers. In the first instance, they counsel employees and employers to
understand their mutual obligations. The aim is to promote sound labour
relations and workplace stability. However, where employers remain
recalcitrant and undermine the laws of the state, my department shall not
hesitate to crack down on those who want to create chaos in the workplace.
[Applause.]
Ukuba ngaba ke iindlebe ezi zabo abazivuli kakuhle, baya kuqhuba ngale
ndlela baqhuba ngayo, njengokuba ndimana ndibeva behewula bekhwaza.
Ndiyabavela ke, ndiyabasizela kakhulu.

Ukuba belikho ithuba - ndibhekisa kuMnu Ramodike - bendiya kukhe - uyabuza
ukuba ndithini na kuba akasiva isiXhosa ... [Kwahlekwa.] Unempandla kodwa
isiXhosa akasiva, ngoku iyamtya into yokuba ndibe ndithetha ulwimi
lwasekhaya, iyamhlafuna apha entloko unkabi - bendiza kukhe ndinabe, kodwa
ke ngethemba lokuba ulilungu lala komiti yesebe lolawulo, siya kuzinika
ithuba lokuba siyazise ikomiti ukuba sindawoni na malunga neQonga leeNgxoxo
ngezemiSebenzi (Jobs Summit) ukwenzela ukuba sihambe kunye, sincedisane
ngalo mba kunjalo nje.

Ndiyalibulela kakhulu ilungu elihloniphekileyo uLishivha, elikhankanye
indima yoKhuseleko nokuKhathalelwa kweMpilo eMsebenzini. (Translation of
Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[If they do not open their ears properly then they are going to conduct
themselves in the manner they do, by way of interjecting and the loud
shouts that I can hear. I sympathise with them. I pity them very much.
If there was time available - I am referring to Mr Ramodike - would have
... he is asking what I am saying because he does not understand isiXhosa
... [Laughter.] The fact that I am delivering my speech in my home language
is bugging him, it is working on the mind of the `fellow' - I would have
elaborated but he is, hopefully, a member of the portfolio committee, we
are going to afford ourselves an opportunity of informing it about where we
are with regard to the Jobs Summit so that we move on together and we help
one another about this issue.

I truly thank the hon member, Lishivha, who mentioned occupational safety
and health care in the workplace.]

Cabinet has agreed that we need to integrate and co-ordinate our policies,
because as it stands now the occupational health and safety issues are all
over. There is fragmentation of occupational health and safety. That is why
three departments have been tasked to look into this matter, that is the
Department of Health, the Department of Minerals and Energy and the
Department of Labour. Of course we have to consult a number of other
departments, such as the Departments of Transport and of Environmental
Affairs, etc.
Ndiyawabulela kakhulu ke amalungu ngale nkxaso ingakanana. Andinqweneli
kuphinda ndiwagcina apha ithuba elide. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [I truly thank the
members for such great support. I do not wish, again, to keep members here
for a long time. [Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I do not like to introduce my presence by
shouting ``order'', but you leave me no alternative.

Debate concluded.

            HOW DEVELOPING COUNTRIES COPE WITH NATURAL DISASTERS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, a few weeks ago the House received reports on the
impact of the floods and other disasters on communities in all our
constituencies. Last week I had the opportunity to be briefed on and to see
some of the flood damage in our neighbouring country of Mozambique.
¬†
On behalf of the SADC Parliamentary Forum, the Speaker of the Parliament of
Zimbabwe and I, accompanied by the parliamentary counsellor to the
President, met with President Chissano and conveyed condolences at the loss
of life and pledged support and solidarity to the people of Mozambique. We
were informed that 900 000 Mozambicans had been displaced and nearly 2
million people had been affected by the floods. We overflew vast expanses
of the country under water, some areas as wide as 35 kilometres.
Many rooftops bore pitiful bundles of families' remaining possessions. Many
more homes were totally submerged or destroyed. Over 70 000 cattle had been
killed. Each night, we South Africans have seen the devastation and the
courage and resolve of the people of Mozambique. What we have perhaps not
appreciated fully is how the entire SADC region has responded - each
country providing whatever support they could from the very meagre
resources they have and each country trying to assist their neighbours.

The South African helicopters were not the only regional planes in the
area. All the helicopters in Lesotho and Malawi have also been involved.
Botswana sent one million litres of fuel and Zimbabwe sent 159 tons of
seed.

What has happened in our country in the Northern Province, Mpumalanga,
KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape, and throughout the
SADC region, provides the context of the debate that is to follow. Hundreds
of millions of dollars are needed for relief, and billions more for
repairs. Much more is required for reconstruction and sustained development
to take place. The international community needs to recognise that
development aid cannot be cut down, because there is a need for
reconstruction and relief. But we ourselves need also to recognise that
there is a growing scale of natural disasters which particularly impact on
developing countries.

So, as we look at relief, we need also to consider preventive measures. We
believe - and I would want to commend to this Parliament - that as a
Parliament, we need to start looking at the need to install preventive
measures within our own country, in our region and in developed countries
globally. That is the challenge we face and which affects us all.

With that introduction, hon members, I would wish that we now proceed with
this debate on the motion that I requested should be placed before the
House. And I do not have a speakers' list! [Interjections.] I call upon the
hon G Borman.

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Speaker, hon members, the recent disasters have shown
that the Government's policy in this area is just that: a national
disaster. [Interjections.]

The DP would first like to express its sincere sympathy with the victims of
the disasters that have recently ravaged our subcontinent. We have watched,
night by night, on TV the loss of human life, homes, shelter and livestock
as a result of tornadoes, fires and floods. We have been stunned and
saddened by the terrible human suffering involved. The DP salutes all those
who worked so tirelessly under very difficult circumstances to rescue and
bring relief to those affected.

However, we have become increasingly aware of the tragic lack of co-
ordination between all the relevant role-players and the inexcusable
absence of a proper disaster management policy. Let me sketch this
Government's bumbling and fumbling which has gone on since 1994.
[Interjections.] In 1994, after the floods on the Cape Flats, Cabinet
decided to assess South Africa's disaster management. What did they do?
They reviewed the structures. A year down the line, Cabinet made the
brilliant recommendation that a formal structure for disaster management be
established. Another year later, in February 1996, the national disaster
management committee was established to act as a co-ordinating and managing
body. In March 1997, a great step forward was taken. The Cabinet formed an
interministerial committee for disaster management and included Ministers
from 13 portfolios. It was necessary. This committee proved the truth of
the old saying that a committee is a group of people who, individually, can
do nothing but collectively can meet together and decide that nothing can
be done.

Eventually, in February 1998, a Green Paper was published for comment. Ten
months later the Cabinet approved a White Paper and in January this year
the Disaster Management Bill was finally published for public comment.
Goodness knows how many disasters have come and gone whilst the Government
talks to itself about disaster management. In the very month that this
collection of words was being bandied around, the Constantiaberg and
Simon's Town fires were raging. Once more, Rome burnt whilst Nero fiddled.
How long does it take this Government to formulate policy and do something?
[Interjections.]

The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government deemed it to be
an urgent matter. So what did it do? Hon members have guessed it: it set up
a special committee! This committee met once in February. It was a shambles
that was arranged at the last minute. There was no quorum and the meeting
had to be abandoned. [Interjections.] We are still waiting for the next
one. That is how serious this Parliament is about the problem.

The DP believes that the present policy is inadequate. The affected party
should not be dependent on ad hoc decisions reflecting the grace and favour
of either the President or the Minister. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Are you rising on a point of order?

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam Speaker, is the hon member prepared to take a
question?

Mrs G M BORMAN: No! I will take one at the end if I have time.

I now want to focus on our priorities as developing countries. The Mail &
Gaurdian, dated 24 to 30 March, featured a letter from Norman Tshumbi of
Windhoek, in which he responds to a question under the heading ``Well done,
South Africa: Where are the other countries that possess helicoptors?'' and
I quote:


  In defence of Namibia, I have to inform you that as a poor country our
  airforce only had two helicoptors. These were sent to the Democratic
  Republic of Congo to shoot at some people. We were subsequently informed
  that they crashed mid-air in bad weather, killing everyone in the
  helicopter. So we are unable to send any to Mozambique.

I continue with what Mr Tshumbi said:


  While the priorities of the UN's High Commission for Refugees leaves much
  to be desired, we need to look at our government's priorities. Had we not
  committed us to the war in Congo, Namibia could have assisted with
  plucking people from tree tops and Zimbabwe could have had more money for
  petrol.

This, sadly, reflects the microcosm of Africa as a whole. We have no
trouble mobilising our limited resources to kill and we have nothing left
with which to save lives.
From the research that we have done, we have found that ...
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: That is all you know: research!

Mrs G M BORMAN: ... responsible governments around the world - including
Bangladesh, for example - had clear policy guidelines for disaster
management with four essential components: prevention, preparedness,
response and recovery.

In view of all this, the DP calls on the Government to instruct the SANDF
to establish a disaster management task force whose responsibility it would
be to co-ordinate all the resources available - military, business, the
private sector, NGOs and churches - with a clear line of command and
communication. We must avoid at all cost the muddle over permission to land
at Hoedspruit whilst people are dying, as happened recently.

The DP believes that South Africa should take the lead in SADC over this
matter. We have the best resources and personnel and should be seeking to
co-ordinate the countries of the region in responding to disasters. [Time
expired.]

Rev K M ZONDI: Madam Speaker, hon members, I think this debate warrants
quite a modicum of respect in the sense that disasters and natural
disasters affect the poorest of the poor.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Rev K M ZONDI: In fact, this is not a matter which should be used as a
party-political football. [Applause.]

I think the recent floods in countries such as Mozambique and Madagascar
have once again highlighted the shocking lack of capacity on the part of
these countries to deal effectively with natural disasters. Both Mozambique
and Madagascar are among the poorest countries in the developing world.

Developing countries are, by definition, operating on shoe-string budgets
where priorities are set in a manner that is designed to meet only the bare
necessities of life, such as food, medication and shelter. Quite clearly
the state of readiness to deal with natural disasters inevitably becomes a
standard and a luxury poor countries cannot attain and afford at will.

People living in developing countries thus bear the brunt of their
countries' inability to protect them in the wake of natural disasters. This
means that the overwhelming majority of the world's population will
continue to suffer the devastating effects of natural disasters with very
little protection.

According to figures released by the UN World Development Report, it is
estimated that by the year 2025, 80% of the world's population will live in
developing countries, and half of this figure represents people who will be
in areas highly vulnerable to flooding and storms. Developing countries
become entirely dependent on the assistance that the international
community can give. The trouble is that it takes time for the international
community to respond in a co-ordinated fashion to cries of dire need for
help.

The aftermath of disasters imposes very heavy and negative consequences on
developing countries. Their economies suffer such setbacks that they
regress by decades. It is therefore imperative that the world community
functions even more as a unit and begins to deal with natural disasters in
a properly co-ordinated and proactive fashion. There has to be a joining
together of hands between the developed and developing nations, aimed at
helping the establishment of local capacities in developing nations to
enable them to begin to cope with these disasters and their aftermath.

The developing countries will have to achieve this by putting in place co-
ordinated and preventative measures, measures that are capable of
interpreting data and trends in such phenomena as global warming. For
example, we are told that half the world's population lives in coastal
zones. This translates to 10 million people who are at constant risk of
experiencing flooding. Now, the role of the international community is to
establish proactive and reactive measures that are going to enhance its
capacity to act with swiftness in the wake of pending and striking
disasters.

The interdependence between developing and developed countries necessitated
and brought about by globalisation compels the international community to
act as one, as none of the developing countries can actually be expected to
deal with these disasters on their own. For example, we are informed that,
owing to natural disasters, 60% of the world's population will be living in
zones potentially infested with malaria by the year 2100, and that there
could be an estimated extra 50 million to 80 million cases of malaria and
3,5 million more cases of river-blindness.

All these figures indicate, in a small way, however remote it might seem at
the present moment, that these natural disasters confront very poor nations
which are ill-equipped, not because of mistakes they are making, but merely
because these are the conditions in which they find themselves. In many
cases, they are not responsible for them. We call for co-ordinated action
on the part of the international community. [Applause.]

Mev M E OLCKERS: Mevrou die Speaker, die hantering van natuurlike rampe
deur ontwikkelende lande - trouens deur enige land ter w√™reld - sal altyd
afhang van die intensiteit, omvang en ligging van sodanige ramp. Omdat
hierdie faktore nie vooraf bepaal kan word nie, vereis die hantering van so
'n situasie deurlopende gereedheid. Die verwysing na ontwikkelende lande
impliseer lande met klein ekonomie√´ en gebrekkige hulpmiddels, wat dit
uiters moeilik maak om onverwagse situasies te hanteer.

Die onlangse ramp in Mosambiek en die noordelike provinsies van die
Republiek van Suid-Afrika, asook in die aangrensende gebied van KwaZulu-
Natal, het nie net die lewe van talle mense ge√´is nie, maar in groot
gebiede is die infrastruktuur vernietig, wat die slagaar van hul ekonomiese
ontwikkeling is. Skade aan ho√´potensiaal-landbougrond sal net herstel kan
word teen geweldige koste. Voeg daaraan toe die verlies aan behuising en
die uitbreek van siekte-epidemies, asook die koste wat die herstel van
eersgenoemde en bekamping van laasgenoemde meebring, en dan besef 'n mens
die ontsaglike skade wat natuurrampe kan veroorsaak.

Die hantering van natuurrampe en die nagevolge daarvan binne die grense van
'n bepaalde staat bly daardie regering se verantwoordelikheid. Die state
wat deel uitmaak van die Suider-Afrikaanse Ontwikkelingsgemeenskap het nie
die ekonomiese mag of hulpmiddels om so 'n situasie op 'n ad hoc-grondslag
te hanteer nie. Om di√© situasie te hanteer, is dit noodsaaklik dat elkeen
van hierdie lande 'n permanente regeringsramptrust skep waartoe die staat
jaarliks bydra en waarheen skenkings vir hierdie doel gekanaliseer kan
word.

Tweedens moet in ag geneem word dat 'n ramp sulke afmetings kan aanneem dat
buurstate eintlik 'n morele verpligting het om hulp te verleen, maar dit
nie altyd kan bekostig nie. Daarom, glo ek, moet baie ernstig oorweeg word
om 'n interstaatlike rampfonds te stig waartoe alle deelnemende state
volgens 'n vaste formule 'n verpligte jaarlikse bydrae lewer. So 'n fonds
moet bestuur word volgens 'n ooreenkoms of akte van aanwending sodat
misbruike sover moontlik vermy kan word. Wanneer rampe menslike nood en
lyding veroorsaak, moet die vraag nie wees of hulp verleen gaan word nie,
maar eerder hoe vinnig hulp verleen kan word en wat die omvang daarvan gaan
wees.

Wat Suid-Afrika betref, hoop ek van harte dat wetgewing oor rampbestuur
opgestel kan word wat elke moontlikheid sal uitskakel dat die lyding van
mense gebruik word om politieke punte aan te teken. Dit is dringend
noodsaaklik dat 'n beleid geformuleer word wat rampsituasies gebalanseerd
sal evalueer. Voedselproduksie is net so belangrik soos water en
elektrisiteit, en andersom.

Miskien kan die grootste sukses teen rampe in Suider-Afrika bereik word
deur groter prioriteit te gee aan ordelike ruimtelike beplanning. Die man
wat sy huis teen 'n hoogte bou se kanse op oorlewing is groter as di√© van
'n man wat sy huis op die walle van 'n rivier bou.

Die VN beraam dat 80% van die w√™reldbevolking in 2025 in ontwikkelende
lande sal woon. Gegewe die veranderende, ekstreme weersomstandighede, waar
die een orkaan elke 50 jaar nou een elke 10 jaar geword het, is die
stigting van so 'n interstaatlike rampfonds noodsaaklik. [Tyd verstreke.]

[Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, the managing of natural disasters by
developing countries - in fact by any country in the world - will always
depend on the intensity, extent and location of such a disaster. Because
these factors cannot be predetermined, the managing of such a situation
requires continuous preparedness. The reference to developing countries
implies countries with small economies and insufficient resources, which
makes it extremely difficult to manage unexpected situations.

The recent disaster in Mozambique and the northern provinces of the
Republic of South Africa, as well as in the neighbouring area of KwaZulu-
Natal, not only claimed the lives of many people, but destroyed the
infrastructure in large areas, which is the main artery of their economic
development. Damage to high-potential agricultural land will only be made
good at enormous expense. Add to that the loss of housing and the outbreak
of epidemics, as well as the costs which the reparation of the
firstmentioned and the control of the lastmentioned will bring about, and
one realises the enormous damage which natural disasters can cause.

The managing of natural disasters and their consequences within the borders
of a specific state remain the responsibility of that government. The
states which comprise the Southern African Development Community do not
have the economic power or the resources to deal with such a situation on
an ad hoc basis. To deal with a situation such as this, it is imperative
that every one of these countries creates a permanent government disaster
trust to which the state contributes annually and to which donations could
be channelled for this purpose.

Secondly, one should take into consideration the fact that a disaster could
assume such alarming proportions that neighbouring countries actually have
a moral obligation to offer help, but cannot always afford to do so. For
this reason I believe that we should very seriously consider establishing
an interstate disaster fund to which every participating state would make a
compulsory annual contribution according to a fixed formula. Such a fund
should be managed according to an agreement or deed of application so that
misuse can be avoided as far as possible. When disasters cause human need
and suffering the question should not be asked whether help should be
given, but rather how quickly that help can be given and what the extent of
that help is going to be.

As far as South Africa is concerned, I sincerely hope that legislation on
disaster management can be drafted which will eliminate every possibility
of using the suffering of people to score political points. It is vital
that a policy should be formulated which can evaluate disaster situations
in a balanced manner. Food production is just as important as water and
electricity and vice versa.

Perhaps the greatest success against disasters in Southern   Africa can be
achieved by giving even greater priority to orderly spatial planning. The
man who builds his house on a hill has a better chance of survival than the
man who builds his house on the banks of a river.

The UN estimates that in 2025 80% of the world population will be living in
developing countries. Given the changing, extreme weather conditions, where
one hurricane every 50 years has now become one every 10 years, the
establishment of such an interstate disaster fund is imperative. [Time
expired.]]

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Speaker, I sometimes wonder if people understand what is
going on and what their responsibilities are. Let me start with the last
speaker. She was probably just giving her own opinion because she does not
actually sit in my portfolio committee, which deals with these matters.
Someone else from the NP is there and I expected that person at least to
participate in this debate. Maybe they do not follow what is happening
there or they do not understand.

I just want to clarify some issues that were mentioned by the speaker from
the DP, the hon member Gloria Borman, who actually serves on the
subcommittee that deals with disaster management. I am really surprised by
her utterances and I can only wonder if people are really honest about
their responsibilities, because these matters are dealt with at that level.

In terms of what she was saying here, it appears as if she was not part of
that committee and has never been to that committee. [Interjections.] She
knows very well that there is a White Paper, but of course, this morning
she again alluded to the fact that she is not aware of an existing White
Paper. [Interjections.] Also, this morning we were informed that there is
legislation in the pipeline to deal particularly with disaster management,
but again she stands here denying any knowledge of such legislation.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: She is a disaster herself.

Mr B M SOLO: That is correct. We have disasters within ourselves sometimes,
particularly in the case of the DP. [Interjections.] I am really
disappointed, because I did not expect that. The hon Gloria Borman goes on
to say ... [Laughter.]

Ngifuna ukuqinisekisa ukuthi amalungu alalele nokuthi ayezwa uma ngikhuluma
ngoba awalaleli uma sisemihlanganweni. [I want to ensure that hon members
are listening and that they have heard what I have just said because they
do not listen at meetings.]

Sometimes it is as if we are wasting our time, and I want to request
members please to participate in the deliberations in this Parliament,
because that is what we are here for. I say this because although members
are always in these portfolio committee meetings, they keep quiet
throughout, but then they come and stand here and stage a grand show.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

I also want to remind this House of the fact that Parliament, at the
beginning of this year, released about 17 MPs to go to the various areas
that had been affected by disasters. This shows how serious this Parliament
is about that general situation. This morning, again, we were briefed by
the department on all its activities and efforts to deal with this problem.

Yes, it is true that the subcommittee sat some time in February - that is
correct. But how many members in that meeting were from the opposition
parties?

An HON MEMBER: What year was that?

Mr B M SOLO: I am talking about this year, as that hon member knows very
well. I should probably start a class for that member and lecture him in
order to enable him to understand these things.

Again, we spent about four hours with the department. The department
informed us of all its efforts to ensure that it deals with this matter of
disaster management. I want to put it to members that we are serious and
that this debate is very important. We are going to deal with this matter
in a way that we deem fit. We are not going to be advised by them, because
it is clear that they live in a different country. Of course, they know
their history, and I do not have to repeat it. They must note that people
are dying and that the people who are actually dying are the poorest of the
poor, not because of their own doing, but because of their history and the
political history of this country.

The importance of this debate should not be undermined. The question of
natural disasters is very critical to developing countries. Therefore the
debate today should be welcomed by all South Africans and the world
community as a whole, except probably the DP whose members do not see
themselves as South Africans. It is also equally important to note the
seriousness of our Government in dealing with this matter and in trying to
ensure the rescue, protection and security of all communities against any
form of disaster.

Before addressing issues raised in the debate, I want to extend our deep
sorrow and regret, on behalf of all South Africans, at the loss of hundreds
of lives and the destruction of property and the environment as a result of
the recent floods caused by cyclonic weather conditions. I further want to
express our solidarity with those poor countries that have been
detrimentally been affected and express our sympathy to the bereaved and
flood-affected territories, not only in South Africa, but also throughout
the SADC region. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I will not be able
to deal with all matters that I would have liked to deal with. But I will,
in an economic way, restrict myself to those matters that need emphasis.

While all countries are affected by natural disasters, the impact on
developing countries is greater. The majority of the world population
inhabit these countries, amongst which are the poorest of the poor
accounting for 90% of those killed annually in such events. Development
programmes are set back and a greater strain ... [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker ... Interjections.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, on a point of information ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! No, hon member, you cannot do that.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: I beg your pardon, Madam Speaker, it is a point of order.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, could you start with your point of order,
please.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: I would just like to
inform you that our member ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! No, hon member, I have a lot of experience with members
sneaking in other matters behind points of order.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Speaker, on a straightforward point of order: I
suppose the previous hon speaker was referring to our member Mr Frik van
Deventer, who is in hospital having tests. I think it is petty politics to
say that he is not here. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, I am sorry, but that is not a point of
order. I take note of the information, but you should convey it to the
member concerned. Would the next speaker please proceed.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, the UDM wishes to thank you for initiating
this debate in this hon House. It is a very important debate and it is in
the best interests of the nation. The underlying point here is what other
developing countries are doing in order to cope with unforeseen natural
disasters.

It can never be a question of pointing a finger at one another or at the
Government. Disasters are forces of nature which are unpredictable. They
are acts of the omnipresent and the omnipotent which even prophets and
scientists are finding very difficult to comprehend.

I had the privilege of visiting many countries abroad which have been hit
by natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and famine. I also had the
privilege, a week ago, of accompanying the Portfolio Committee on Public
Works during a visit to the flood-damaged areas in the Northern Province. I
speak here with first-hand information and knowledge of the severe amount
of damage I have seen to road infrastructure and other damaged property.

It was indeed very unfortunate that only two political parties took the
trouble to visit the flood-damaged areas in the Northern Province. An
overview contained in the World Disaster Report of 1999 produced by the
International Committee of the Red Cross and the SA Red Cross Society, many
disasters could be mitigated if more cash was spent on disaster
preparedness.

A recent cost benefit analysis suggested that US $3,15 billion invested in
China over the past 40 years in order to control floods averted potential
losses of US $12 billion. [Interjections.]

Mrs M L NGWENYA: Madam Speaker, can the hon member take a question?

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, are you prepared to take a question?

Mr M N RAMODIKE: No, Madam Speaker, that will waste my time.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, will you please take your seat. Hon
members, please do not rise on points of order when you know that they are
not points of order.

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Madam Speaker, confronted by continuing humanitarian needs
in South Africa's neighbouring countries, and constraints in our budget and
mistakes of past poor planning and performance, South Africa should now
join others in the Humanitarian Charter on Minimum Standards and
Requirements in Disaster Response. It is frightening to know that half of
the world's population live in coastal zones, and indeed that over 10
million of these people are, according to experts, at constant risk of
being flooded.

The rate indicators that are referred to by the United Nations, and which
estimate that people living in developing countries are highly vulnerable
to flooding and storms, should be taken seriously. Flooding was experienced
in Mpumalanga, the North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, the Northern
Province and the Eastern Cape and also in Mozambique and Madagascar. These
areas were hit by a cyclone which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of
people.

Further indicators point to sea-level rises. Tides are predicted to rise by
44 cm by the year 2080, which may result in millions of people being
flooded. The UDM will support any endeavour and programme of a development
strategy aimed at natural disaster mitigation. We call on the Government to
involve all stakeholders in building international links, which will
promote local and international disaster preparedness, with the aim of
being proactive, rather than the reactive research we have at present.
[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, a document detailing strategy for
managing crises states:
  Africa's crises are in large part due to the chronic state of
  underdevelopment in the region. What is more, disasters and
  underdevelopment create a vicious cycle that is difficult to break. It is
  understood that developing countries are far more susceptible to crises
  threats than are developed countries.

The same document states that the sub-Saharan region has recently
experienced the greatest frequency and most serious effects of disasters,
more than any other region in the world. The document quotes the Africa
regional director of the WHO who said that, out of a population of more
than 744 million, 734 million lived in countries that were considered to be
disaster prone.

The question we need to ask is: What are the reasons or factors that give
rise to these crises? The reference mentions that in spite of the frequency
of natural disasters, very few deaths are caused by these crises. They do,
however, have a huge impact on homelessness or displacement. Epidemic
crises have, however, resulted in substantially higher levels of mortality
in the 1970s and 1980s.

Since the 1990s, conflict-related crises represent the most serious threat
to development initiatives. Millions of lives have been lost in the last
decade through conflict. In other words, the crises in Africa are varyingly
held together by certain causal factors.

The question is not how developing countries cope with natural disasters.
The simple fact is that Africa cannot afford to face any crises of whatever
shape or form. At the opening of the regional meeting on natural disasters
in Nairobi in 1999, the Kenyan Minister of State in his opening address
made the following comments:


  Africa cannot afford natural disasters because they tend to exacerbate
  poverty conditions. A single natural disaster in an African country may
  reverse fundamentally the gains made on the development front and the
  recovery from the same would disrupt national development plans and
  public budgets or exhaust scarce national resources.

The sad state of affairs about the African continent's response to natural
disasters, according to the Financial Times of 12 March 2000, is that
nothing is being done to stop a recurrence of floods and other potential
natural disasters in future years. The sooner we learn that the world views
the problems of Africa as those that Africans will have to call with
themselves, the more Africans will have call to account those governments
who are responsible for bad governance. The development of Africa will not
be primarily driven by the good intentions of developed countries, but must
be driven by the moral imperative of respect for institutional democracy
and good government. [Applause.]

Genl C L VILJOEN: Daar is 'n ou beginsel wat lui dat as 'n mens se buurman
se huis brand, jy nie net staan en kyk nie; jy spring in en jy help. Dit is
die kernbeginsel as ons kom by die kwessie van hoe ons rampe kan bekamp.
Dit gaan dus om medemenslikheid; om te keer dat mense skade ly, en √°s hulle
skade ly, om hulle so vinnig moontlik te help.

Al is 'n ontwikkelende land arm of al het hy te min bronne, moet so 'n land
homself help. So 'n land moet ook bereid wees om ander te help. Hoe word
dit gedoen? 'n Ontwikkelende land kan arm wees, maar hy kan 'n goeie
regering h√™, 'n regering wat met wysheid regeer. Ek gaan nou vir agb lede
vier belangrike stappe noem wat so 'n regering kan toepas om hierdie soort
bekamping te vermag.
Eerstens moet so 'n regering voorkomende stappe en beplanning doen. 'n
Goeie regering laat nie toe dat huise in laagwatergebiede gebou word waar
dit deur vloedwater weggeneem kan word nie. Ons weet mos nou waar die
afgelope oorstromings was, en ons weet dit het 'n besonder ho√´ vlak bereik.
Ons weet dus nou waar om huise te bou en waar om hulle nie te bou nie.

'n Goeie regering laat nie plakkerskampe of ho√´digtheid-informele behuising
toe waarin daar nie behoorlike toegangspaaie is wat die bestryding van
brande moeilik maak nie. 'n Goeie regering laat nie 'n swak struktuur toe
in gebiede waarin daar aardbewings voorkom nie. Goeie regering is dus een
van die eerste beginsels, en enige land - ontwikkeld of onontwikkeld - kan
goeie regering h√™.

Tweedens sorg 'n goeie regering ook vir gebeurlikheidsplanne op sowel
nasionale as plaaslike vlak. Onlangs toe ons die brande hier in die Wes-
Kaap gehad het, was ek verstom toe ek my in antwoord op 'n oproep van 'n
radiostasie as vrywilliger aangemeld het om te gaan help vuurslaan. Daar
was baie vrywilligers wat hulle aangemeld het, maar eerstens was die
strukture nie gereed om vrywilligers te hanteer nie en tweedens was die
vrywilligers ook nie almal opgelei om te doen wat van hulle verwag is nie.

Derdens sorg 'n goeie regering dat daar in di√© verband vir internasionale
en streeksamewerking voorsiening gemaak word. Ons het die saak in hierdie
Huis bespreek, en ek het my toespraak afgesluit met 'n beroep op die
Regering vir 'n besigheidsplan oor hoe die huidige oorstromings gehanteer
gaan word.

Ons weet mos as dit in die Limpopo re√´n, gaan die water af na Xai-Xai toe
in Mosambiek. Was daar skakeling en was daar genoegsame samewerking in di√©
verband? Was die helikopterbrandstof vooruitgeplaas, en is daar voorsiening
gemaak om mense betyds uit die laagliggende gebiede van Mosambiek te
verwyder?

Laastens moet 'n goeie regering sorg dat die herskedulering van
regeringsprioriteite onmiddellik plaasvind sover dit besteding betref n√° so
'n ramp 'n land getref het. 'n Goeie regering wat wakker regeer, al is die
land arm, kan baie doen om rampe te bekamp. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Gen C L VILJOEN: There is an old principle which has it that if one's
neighbour's house is burning, one does not merely stand and watch; one
jumps in and renders assistance. This is the core principle when we come to
the issue of how one can combat disasters. The issue is therefore common
humanity; to prevent people suffering damage, and if they do suffer damage,
to help them as quickly as possible.

Even if a developing country is poor or has too few resources, such a
country must still help itself. Such a country must also be prepared to
help others. How is this done? A developing country can be poor, but it can
have a good government, a government which governs with wisdom. I am now
going to mention for hon members four important steps which such a
government can implement to achieve this sort of action.

Firstly, such a government must take preventative steps and do planning. A
good government does not allow houses to be built in low-water areas where
they can be carried away by flood waters. We now know where the recent
floodings took place and we know that they reached a particularly high
level. We therefore now know where to build houses and where not to build
them.

A good government does not allow squatter camps or high-density informal
housing where there are not adequate access roads which can hamper the
fighting of fires. A good government does not allow a weak structure in
areas in which earthquakes occur. A good government is therefore one of the
first principles, and any country - developed or undeveloped - can have a
good government.

Secondly, a good government takes care of contingency plans at national as
well as local level. When we had the recent fires here in the Western Cape,
I was astounded when, in response to an appeal from a radio station, I
reported as a volunteer to help fight the fires. There were many volunteers
who reported, but firstly the structures were not prepared to deal with
volunteers and secondly the volunteers were not all trained to do what was
expected of them.

Thirdly, a good government sees to it that in this regard provision is made
for international and regional co-operation. We have discussed this matter
in the House, and I concluded my speech with an appeal to the Government
for a business plan on how the current floodings are going to be dealt
with.

Surely we know that if it rains in the Limpopo, the water travels down to
Xai-Xai in Mozambique. Was there liaison and was there sufficient co-
operation in this regard? Was the helicopter fuel placed on site, and was
provision made timeously to remove people from the low-lying areas of
Mozambique?

Finally, after such a disaster has hit a country a good government must
ensure that the rescheduling of government priorities as far as spending is
concerned takes place immediately. A good government which governs in an
alert manner, can do a lot to combat disasters, even if the country is
poor. [Interjections.]]

Mr G E BALOI: Madam Speaker, according to the World Disaster Report of
1999, there were more natural disasters in 1998 than in any year on record.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, forest fires and hurricanes
are increasingly threatening the world. The climatic changes are real and
every week new evidence emerges indicating the increase of natural
disasters. In the last decade, on average, natural disasters killed 128 000
people and affected another 136 million. However, natural catastrophes
still provoke a knee-jerk response from donor agencies, and more solutions
are still needed.

Fires have occurred in South Africa too. It is estimated that the fires
that devastated the Western Cape cost the country more than R3 billion in
damage. The economic impact of the recent flooding in the northern part of
our country was devastating and the flood damage is estimated at R1,7
billion. Nearly R880 million of this is required just to repair roads,
bridges and drainage.

However, rebuilding is not just about houses, roads and infrastructures, as
metres of sand from river floods cover agricultural land. Most commercial
farmers in the Northern Province lost about 50% of their crops destined for
export. Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Madagascar and Botswana were also devastated
by the recent floods.

El Ni√±o also had an effect and caused 21 000 lives to be lost in 1998. We
are concerned that the Government of developing countries lack resources to
invest in robust infrastructure and prevention ... [Interjections.] [Time
expired.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I would like to be positive in this
debate. I do not think that natural disasters are something that we would
like to deal with, but it is a phenomenon which we have been experiencing
lately that natural disasters seem to be increasing in the world in terms
of their frequency. Millions of people, especially the poor, are usually
the hardest hit when a flood or a drought or an earthquake occurs. These
disasters can never be predicted with precision and no government has a
fool-proof plan to contain disasters.

Die sleutel tot die sinvolle hantering van natuurrampe l√™ in die vermo√´ van
'n land se staatsdiens en sy private sektor om vinnig te reageer en die
gevolge te beperk sodra 'n ramp voorkom.

Hiervoor is 'n klein kernkomitee nodig wat die nodige gesag dra en wat die
hulpbronne van die staat en die private sektor vinnig en effektief kan
mobiliseer om hulp te verleen en die verlening daarvan te moniteer. Hierdie
liggaam moet ook die tydperke tussen rampe gebruik om voorsorgmaatre√´ls in
plek te kry om die effek van rampe, as dit sou voorkom, tot die minimum te
beperk.

Dit is so dat die grootste lewensverlies as gevolg van rampe plaasvind
binne die eerste uur n√° 'n ramp. Dit is dan wanneer doelgerigte, vinnige
optrede noodsaaklik is. Die skep van skakelpunte tussen departemente en
tussen regerings is dus noodsaaklik vir sinvolle rampbeheer.

Die optrede van instansies soos die Weermag en private sektor gedurende die
afgelope rampe in Suid-Afrika was lofwaardig. Dit wys net wat goeie
organisasie kan doen en waar die uitdaging vir die suksesvolle hantering
van rampe l√™. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[The key to dealing meaningfully with natural disasters lies in the ability
of a country's public service and its private sector to react quickly and
to limit the effects of a disaster as soon as it occurs.

For this purpose a small core committee is required which has the necessary
authority and which can quickly and effectively mobilise the resources of
the state and the private sector to provide aid and to monitor the
rendering thereof. This body should also make use of the periods between
disasters to establish preventative measures in order to limit the effect
of disasters, if they do occur, to the minimum.

It is a fact that the greatest loss of life owing to disasters occurs
within the first hour after the disaster. It is then that purposeful and
speedy action is necessary. The creation of links between departments and
governments is therefore essential for meaningful disaster control.
The actions of institutions such as the Defence Force and the private
sector during the recent disasters in South Africa were commendable. This
just goes to show what good organisation can do and where the challenge
lies for dealing successfully with disasters. [Interjections.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I thank you for introducing this very
important debate. The spate of multiple disasters in developing countries
has placed a strain on the international relief system. Developing
countries are not facilitated to respond proactively to disasters,
therefore this worsens the plight. The immense and simultaneous demand for
assistance from the various international relief institutions, frustrates
the system and weakens timeous response, therefore natural disaster
mitigation must be promoted at international and local level.

The key to effective international disaster management is efficient
administration and co-ordination. The objectives and strategies of an
international disaster committee must be long term so that response can be
executed with unconditional preparedness. When spearheading and co-
ordinating an international response to disaster, attention must be focused
on the role of NGOs, the free-market charity system and the fact that in
most Western countries soldiers are trained for  short-term military
objectives, but not equipped with appropriate skills to handle disasters,
therefore every assistance must be given wherever possible to the affected
areas.

It is no use standing here and criticising and pointing fingers. Let us get
together and find a solution to the problem. [Applause.]

Mr C NQAKULA: Madam Speaker, today's debate is one of a number of
initiatives that were mounted at different times in the recent past to
discuss the formulation of measures to deal effectively with natural
disasters in developing countries. The floods in Mozambique provided a
platform for such discussions. One of the noteworthy events following the
floods in Mozambique was the holding by SADC in Maputo on 14 March of an
extraordinary summit of its heads of state and government.

The objective of the summit was to review the impact of the floods on SADC
countries, particularly Mozambique. The heads of state appreciated the
necessity to establish mechanisms that would enable developing countries to
respond effectively and timeously to disasters. The approach of the ANC on
these questions - and also in respect of political conflict that lead to
violence - is that the adoption of preventative strategies is much more
effective. Reaction after the fact is always more expensive.

In this context, Government published a White Paper in which a new approach
is mooted regarding disaster management. The approach leans more heavily on
the necessity to reduce the probability and severity of disaster
occurrences, as opposed to reliance only on emergency rescue services.
Given their nature and character, developing countries need good systems in
place to respond to natural disasters. This is so because disasters impact
directly on the economy and social wellbeing of countries where they occur.

I was recently part of a group - as the Speaker said - of SADC
Parliamentary Forum members on a visit to Mozambique. The scenes of
devastation that we saw were just as she described them. There are areas
where it may not even be possible to achieve total reconstruction as the
country very slowly begins to pick up the pieces, whereas in our country,
in provinces like the Northern Province, Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the
Eastern Cape, to mention but a few, it looks as if the speed to recovery is
faster than in Mozambique.

The fact is that there has been a tremendous loss of lives of loved ones
and possessions. There was a news item the other day of the 50 shacks that
were destroyed by fire in an informal settlement near Langa. One of those
who lost their possessions in the disaster spoke about the R400 he had
saved in the shack. If the story of that amount of money was told, I am
certain that we would learn about the struggle by the person to raise and
save it. It may even have been his only savings which took him years to put
together. That is the tragedy of disasters. That is why it is better to
prevent them from happening or to minimise their impact when they do
happen.

When disasters hit, poor people suffer the most. It should be remembered
that most of those who live in shacks are forced in that direction by
poverty. The process of building the shacks is not planned, as informal
settlements at times spring up through land invasion. The area where the
shacks are built is often small and this leads to great density where one
shack literally springs up on the doorstep of the next. The consequence
often is that when one shack burns, many others in the vicinity become
victims of that fire.

It is true, therefore, that while disasters may be natural, their
consequences are socially determined. The effects of poor planning, as well
as lack of access to suitable land, housing and so on hit poor people more.
In Mozambique, one could not but note that most of the houses which
survived the floods were built by the Portuguese settlers. We note with a
sense of pride that our Government is according the matter of disaster
management serious attention.

Government has an interministerial committee for disaster management. But
the matter of disasters should be, in the first instance, a question that
involves all our people. The ANC calls upon leaders and members of the
opposition to consider this one matter as an issue where we should not try
to score political points. Of course, it is in character, in so far as the
DP is concerned, to adopt the stance that they have adopted. It reminds one
of the story of the frog, which was going to cross a flooded river. It came
upon a scorpion, which asked it for a ride to cross the river. The frog
correctly said that it could not do that, because the scorpion would sting
and kill it. But the scorpion assured the frog that it would not do it as
it needed to cross the flooded river. As the story goes, right in the
middle of the river, the scorpion, true to character, stung the frog. As
the two were drowning, the frog said to the scorpion that it had assured it
that it would not sting it. The scorpion said that it was in its character
to do that sort of thing. It is in the character of the DP to be
destructive all the time, even when we are discussing matters of national
interest. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

In the previous debate, when we were dealing with the Labour Vote, the DP
said that one must create conditions in South Africa where the rich, the
bosses, must continue to make huge profits and the workers must receive
meagre wages. That is where they come from. [Interjections.]

However, what we need to do is to mobilise our people in the various
communities where they live to participate as a key component in disaster
management. There are a number of things we should do. We should develop
early warning systems, implement consistent monitoring and tracking and
collect information regarding the phenomena that trigger disasters. We
should acquire modern technical equipment to enable us to deal with these
disasters.

The African continent expects South Africa to always be at the forefront of
disaster management, particularly in the field of emergency rescue
services. This places a particular obligation on us to improve our
programmes and methods in this respect.

The ANC would like to see a situation where significant resources, both
human and material, will be deployed to deal with disasters. We would want
to argue, for instance, for the establishment of an academy to train
appropriate numbers of recruits in emergency rescue operations. On
qualifying, some of the recruits should be deployed at disaster management
centres which the Government should establish in the disaster-prone areas
of our country. Part of their function at these centres would be to educate
people about disasters and train residents to survive such occurrences.

Parliament has already commended the SANDF for its role in Mozambique and
within the borders of our own country as soldiers from various units fought
heroically to minimise the level of devastation in the wake of the recent
floods. However, it is in order, I believe, to once more say, ``Well
done!''

Of course, the DP would like to see a situation similar to that of the past
where soldiers from South Africa, as part and parcel of the policies of the
apartheid regime, went into these countries to kill people. The SANDF went
to Mozambique to save people, as part and parcel of the policies of our
Government, and the DP is unhappy about that. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I want to address the way in which we have
addressed the subject of this debate. I acknowledge that political parties
are prone to attack their opponents at every opportunity, but it is very
unfortunate that some members in this House have used the entire time
allocated to them to score points off each other.

We need to remind ourselves that the days when our country was isolated are
over. South Africans, including members of this House, need to take their
place as responsible members of the international community, recognising
global interdependence and acknowledging that we are indeed the keepers of
our brothers and sisters.

I want to ask all hon members, individually and collectively, to reflect on
this debate, and to consider how we have contributed to solutions and
whether we have contributed by the way in which we have addressed the
subject matter today. I leave it to hon members to provide their own
answers, having done that reflection. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

            COPING WITH NATURAL DISASTERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
                             (Draft Resolution)

The Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority Party: Madam Speaker, I move without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the increasing incidence of natural disasters in the past
       decade, and in particular, the impact on developing countries;


  (2) is concerned that the governments of developing countries lack
       resources to invest in robust infrastructure and prevention measures,
       and that major natural disasters shatter the economies of large areas
       of the developing world;


  (3) is aware of the implications for developing countries as they try to
       deal with the dislocation caused by natural disasters and
       simultaneously endeavour to sustain development;


  (4) recognises that the increased interdependence of economies, which is
       a consequence of globalisation, should lead to equitable and
       sustainable development;


  (5) calls upon the United Nations and its relevant agencies to spearhead
       and co-ordinate an international response; and


  (6) urges all parliaments to co-operate in working towards such a
       concerted international effort to develop local and international
       disaster preparedness, with the emphasis on proactive rather than
       reactive resourcing, and with the threefold goal of -


       (a)  improving preventative measures, disaster preparedness and
           planning at all levels;


       (b)  expediting the provision of immediate humanitarian relief to the
           affected population; and


       (c)  instituting long-term strategic planning to assist economic and
           other recovery from natural disasters.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 17:45.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     The following guidelines are printed in accordance with he resolution
     adopted in the House on 16 March 2000.

     GUIDELINES FOR TRIAL RUN TO QUESTIONS FOR ORAL REPLY


     1.     CLUSTERS OF MINISTERS


         For the purposes of questions for oral reply each Minister will be
         placed in one of three clusters of Ministers. The clusters will be
         as follows:

         Cluster 1: Peace and Security
         Defence, Foreign Affairs, Safety and Security, Correctional
         Services, Justice and Constitutional Development, Intelligence.

         Cluster 2: Social Service and Governance
         Home Affairs, Education, Welfare, Housing, Public Service,
         Communications, Water Affairs and Forestry, Health, Sport and
         Recreation, Minister in the Office of the President, Provincial
         and Local Government.

         Cluster 3: Economic
         Finance, Public Works, Public Enterprises, Trade and Industry,
         Labour, Agriculture and Land Affairs, Transport, Environmental
         Affairs and Tourism, Minerals and Energy, Arts, Culture, Science
         and Technology.

         The clusters will rotate on a weekly basis so that each cluster of
         Ministers will answer questions every three weeks.


     2.     URGENT QUESTIONS TO MINISTER NOT DUE TO ANSWER


         A member who wants an urgent question to be placed on the Question
         Paper for a day on which such question would not be dealt with by
         a particular cluster, should hand in the question to the Speaker
         and clearly indicate that it is an urgent question. The request
         will be dealt with in the same way as a request for a snap debate.
         Such question must be submitted to the Speaker at the latest by
         12:00 on the Tuesday in the week preceding the week in which the
         question is to be answered. The Questions office must be informed
         by the Speaker's office of the approved questions by 12:00 the
         next day for processing and publication on Friday.


     3.     NUMBER OF QUESTIONS PER MINISTER


         No more than eight questions for oral reply shall be put to a
         Minister on any particular question day: Provided that questions
         transferred from written to oral reply and questions that had been
         standing over are not included in this number.


     4.     ORDER OF QUESTIONS BY PARTIES


         The order in which questions will be asked is the same as that
         applicable to notices of motions in the House, ie
         (1)     ANC
         (2)     DP
         (3)     IFP
         (4)     ANC
         (5)     New NP
         (6)     UDM
         (7)     ANC
         (8)     ACDP/PAC/MF
         (9)     FF/UCDP/FA/AEB/AZAPO

         A party is not obliged to ask a question and should it not do so
         the next party's question will be called.


     5.     NUMBER OF QUESTIONS PER MEMBER


         Each member may ask a maximum of two questions per question day.
         This excludes urgent questions, questions that are on the Question
         Paper because they stood over and written questions transferred
         for oral reply.


     6.     QUESTIONS NOT ANSWERED AT END OF QUESTION TIME


         The procedure relating to such questions remains the same, that is
         replies must be handed in to the Secretary for inclusion in the
         Official Report of Debates of the House. All replies to such
         questions not received by the Secretary before 12:00 on the Monday
         preceding the Tuesday on which the Internal Question Paper for a
         particular question day is published will be regarded as questions
         standing over until the next cluster session. These questions will
         be published at the end of the Question Paper. Parties may decide
         to prioritise such questions.


     7.     PARTY PRIORITY OF QUESTIONS


         Parties will need to prioritise their questions and give the
         Questions office the order in which they want their questions to
         appear on the Question Paper by 12:00 on the Wednesday in the week
         preceding the week in which they are to be answered. If parties do
         not meet this deadline the questions will be published in the
         order that they appear on the Internal Question Paper.

         The Internal Question Paper on Tuesday will contain all the
         questions as they have been received. Parties can use this
         Question Paper to prioritise their questions.

         The Internal Question Paper for Thursday will contain the
         questions in the order in which they will be dealt with on the
         next Wednesday.


     8.     TIME LIMITS FOR QUESTIONS AND REPLIES


         Not more than three minutes will be allowed for the initial answer
         unless the presiding officer is of the opinion that the answer is
         sufficiently important to necessitate an additional time which
         must be limited to two more minutes.

         Five supplementary questions of one minute each will be allowed
         arising from the reply to a question: Provided that the member who
         asked the question should be given the first opportunity to ask a
         supplementary question. The member will be entitled to express an
         opinion.

         The reply to a supplementary question is limited to two minutes,
         unless the presiding officer is of the opinion that the answer is
         sufficiently important to necessitate more time.


     9.     QUESTIONS STANDING OVER


         If a Minister or Deputy Minister requests that a question stands
         over, that question shall stand over for reply until the next
         question day on which his or her cluster replies to questions.

         If a question that is put during question time stands over because
         the Minister is not in the House to answer and the party that
         asked the question so requests, the question will be put on the
         next Question Paper for reply.


         Other questions which will be regarded as standing over are those
         referred to in paragraph 6.


     10.    WRITTEN QUESTIONS TRANSFERRED FOR ORAL REPLY
         The procedure relating to such questions remains the same, with
         the exception that such questions will be cluster-bound.


     11.    QUESTIONS TO THE PRESIDENT


         The President will answer questions of national or international
         importance once a quarter.

         Such questions will be sifted in a process involving the Speaker
         to ensure that only questions satisfying a set criteria are asked
         to the President.

         At any other time questions relating to the President must be
         directed to the Deputy President or the Minister in the Office of
         the President.

         The President will answer a maximum of six questions on each such
         day.

         The order in which parties will ask questions to the President is
         the same as that which applies to questions to Ministers: Provided
         that at the next session of questions to the President the
         sequence will be continued from the point where it was interrupted
         during the previous question session.

         Supplementary questions will be dealt with on the same basis as
         supplementary questions for oral reply to Ministers.
         Procedure:

         Questions to the President must be submitted to the Speaker's
         Office on the Monday, 16 days prior to the Wednesday on which they
         are due to be answered. The Questions office must be informed by
         12:00 on the Tuesday, following that Monday of the approved
         questions so that they can be processed and published by the
         Thursday, almost two weeks before question day.


     12.    QUESTIONS TO THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT


         Questions to the Deputy President will have precedence over
         questions to Ministers.

         The Deputy President will not answer questions in the week that
         the President answers questions or on the day when he or she is
         answering questions in the National Council of Provinces.

         The Deputy President will answer a maximum of four questions per
         question day. The time allocated for such questions forms part of
         the total time for questions.

         The order in which parties will ask questions to the Deputy
         President is the same as that which applies to questions to
         Ministers: Provided that at the next session of questions to the
         Deputy President the sequence will be continued from the point
         where it was interrupted during the previous question session.


     13.    FORM OF QUESTION PAPER


         The Question Paper will only reflect the questions that are due to
         be answered on a particular question day.


     14.    INTERNAL QUESTION PAPER


         The Internal Question Paper will be published on Tuesday, Thursday
         and Friday.

         The format of the Internal Question Paper for Tuesday, which
         contains all the questions for oral reply for the next Wednesday,
         will remain the same.
         The Internal Question Paper for Thursday will contain the
         questions in the order in which they will be answered on the next
         Wednesday. Questions to the President will also appear in
         Wednesday's Internal Question Paper.

         The Internal Question Paper for Friday will contain all the
         questions for written reply received during that parliamentary
         working week.

         The questions will retain their original numbers to assist
         departments and to avoid confusion.

National Assembly:

Papers:

1.    The Speaker:


     (1)    The President of the Republic submitted the following letter,
         dated 3 March 2000, to the Speaker of the National Assembly,
         informing Parliament, in terms of section 201(2) of the
         Constitution, 1996, of the employment of the South African
         National Defence Force in terms of section 201(2)(c) of the
         Constitution, 1996:


         REPORT IN TERMS OF SECTION 201(2) OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
         REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 1996 (ACT 108 OF 1996) ON THE EMPLOYMENT
         OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE FOR SERVICES RELATED
         TO FLOODS IN THE GAZA, MAPUTO AND SOFALA PROVINCES.


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that I authorised the
         employment of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF)
         personnel and equipment in the Provinces. This employment is
         extended from 25 February 2000 to 17 March 2000.

         This employment was authorised in accordance with the provisions
         of section 82(4)(b)(ii) read with section 227(1)(d) of the
         Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of
         1993), [which sections continue to be in force in terms of Item
         24(1) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the Republic of South
         Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996)], read further with section
         3(2)(a)(v) of the Defence Act, 1957 (Act No 44 of 1957).

         A request was received by the Department of Foreign Affairs from
         the Government of the Republic of Mozambique to render
         humanitarian assistance in the location and relocation of people
         trapped by the flooding, and to assist in distributing and
         delivering emergency supplies to the affected areas. In line with
         our international obligations to render such assistance, the
         deployment was authorised.

         The deployment consisted of 88 personnel, 5 X Oryx helicopters, 2
         X BK117 helicopters, 1 X Casa 212 and 3 X Cessna 208 light
         aircraft. The personnel and equipment were deployed to Beira and
         Maputo for the duration of the effort. Other support aircraft
         which were used for the deployment of equipment and support
         personnel to the two locations were 2 X C130 transport aircraft.

         Financial implications
         -  The estimated total cost of this deployment will be R10 267 528-
              00.

         -  I have consulted the Minister of Finance who will make the
              necessary funds available through the Department of Foreign
              Affairs and Defence.


         I will also communicate this report to the Members of the National
         Council of Provinces, and wish to request that you bring the
         contents of this report to the notice of the National Assembly.

         Regards

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:
     Final Declaration of the Parliamentary Meeting on the occasion of
     Unctad X. Adopted unanimously on 11 February 2000.

     We, national legislators elected by our people to represent them, are
     meeting in Bangkok at the invitation of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
     and the Thai National Assembly on the eve of the Tenth Session of the
     United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD X).

     We call on parliaments and their members to become more closely
     involved in the international negotiating process on trade, finance and
     development issues. As members of parliament, we speak for
     constituencies that cut across the divide of rich and poor, capital and
     labour, the public and private sector, and corporate and small-scale
     enterprise. We express concerns that encompass many single issues
     championed by various lobbies and pressure groups. Moreover, greater
     parliamentary involvement can only be beneficial to development.
     Indeed, democracy, respect for the rule of law and a government that is
     transparent and accountable to parliament are indispensable building
     blocks for good governance and sustainable development.

     We are convinced that only through greater solidarity and international
     cooperation will all peoples benefit from the processes of
     globalisation and trade liberalisation. Our participation in the
     formulation of global development policy at UNCTAD X takes on added
     importance at a time when the world community is assessing the
     potential and risks of globalisation and trade liberalisation for world
     economic growth and development and is formulating development
     strategies to make globalisation a process that benefits all peoples.
     We therefore take this opportunity to lay before UNCTAD X our
     perspective on the current state of globalisation and development.

     IMPACT OF GLOBALISATION

     The current processes of globalisation and liberalisation have had a
     major impact on people all over the world, politically, economically,
     socially, culturally and environmentally. While offering unprecedented
     opportunities for expansion of international trade and investment -
     major generators of economic growth and development - globalisation and
     liberalisation can also have substantial adverse repercussions on the
     development process if not properly managed. Although financial and
     trade liberalisation has contributed to economic growth in many
     countries, this has not been the case in others, particularly the less
     developed countries. The Asian financial crisis, the systemic effects
     of which have adversely affected international trade and the global
     economic and social development of many countries in the region and
     beyond, is a clear example of the downside risk of rapid liberalisation
     of financial and capital markets without appropriate supervision and
     regulation and an effective mechanism for the management of short-term
     capital flows.

     For a great number of developing countries, the current international
     trading system within the WTO framework has not yet yielded its
     expected benefits. Developing countries consider that the developed
     members have not yet fully implemented, in terms of both content and
     spirit, their WTO obligations, particularly in the areas of market
     access for agricultural and textile products. Various non-tariff
     barriers have been and continue to be created. They also feel that the
     WTO has yet to create a level playing field and for these reasons
     emphasise their need for special and differential treatment and
     technical assistance, particularly in the area of professional
     training, to implement their WTO obligations.

     These concerns highlight the need to strengthen solidarity and
     international cooperation in transforming existing international trade,
     financial and investment regimes into a more coherent system conducive
     to sustainable development and growth for all.

     Although global management requires international and multilateral
     norms, standards and regimes, they must be flexible and operate within
     an agreed framework. Multilateral systems and regimes have to be
     negotiated to ensure that the concerns of various groups of countries
     are duly taken into account and that, in the end, a balanced settlement
     of interests is achieved.

     The overriding preoccupation in this regard is to ensure that emerging
     multilateral systems enable different national models of political,
     economic and social organisation to function within a universally
     accepted framework of norms and rules. We are strongly convinced that
     no system of globalisation is acceptable if it attempts to impose
     standardised practices irrespective of the cultural and social values
     that have shaped societies through the ages.

     TRADE LIBERALISATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

     There is a growing consensus that economic growth should serve as a
     means towards human development. Growth should translate into the
     betterment of people's lives. International trade as an economic tool
     can make an important contribution to this goal by raising standards of
     living and enhancing employment opportunities, generating a steady
     growth of real income, eliminating poverty and ensuring sustainable
     development.

     Mechanisms are required to ensure that the benefits of trade are widely
     shared, also among countries that are currently marginalized. While
     promoting free and fair trade, we need to establish a level playing
     field. To this end, arrangements for special and differential treatment
     for developing countries and countries with economies in transition
     have to be considered. Importance should also be attached to assistance
     in capacity-building.

     The multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization
     offers the prospect of further trade liberalisation, thus expanding
     trading opportunities. To produce realistic results, the next round of
     multilateral trade negotiations must have a broad-based and balanced
     agenda, taking into account the interests and concerns of all
     participants. Agricultural negotiations should aim at achieving the
     long-term objective of fundamental reform, while taking account of food
     security concerns and the role of agriculture in environmental
     protection. Current obstacles to agricultural trade expansion should be
     reviewed as a matter of urgency. In services, the objective should be
     to achieve progressively higher levels of liberalisation. In the case
     of manufactured products, non-tariff barriers must also be addressed to
     preserve the benefits resulting from tariff reduction. As technology
     holds the key to enhanced productivity and competitiveness, improved
     arrangements to facilitate the transfer of technology are imperative.

     As members of parliament, we reaffirm our belief that economic well-
     being and social development for all - women equally with men, the poor
     and marginalized equally with the wealthy - can be raised through the
     promotion of international trade. However, mechanisms are needed to
     ensure that globalisation and liberalisation effectively lead to
     improvements in labour and environmental standards, the protection of
     children and, generally, respect for human rights. Governments are
     encouraged to pursue a trade policy that facilitates free and open
     trade, without a hidden protectionist agenda.

     NEW INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE AND RESOURCES FOR DEVELOPMENT

     For many years now, the Inter-Parliamentary Union has been speaking on
     behalf of the world parliamentary community in support of the view that
     a new international financial architecture ought to be established in
     order to overcome the deficiencies of current arrangements established
     at Bretton Woods in the 1940s.

     As a result of rapid global liberalisation of financial markets,
     private capital flows of all types have increased in speed and volume.
     But the benefits of liberalised flows of finance are often nullified by
     the adverse effects of excessively volatile short-term capital flows,
     as reflected in the recent Asian financial crisis that has had severe
     negative repercussions on international trade and processes of social
     and economic development in the region and beyond. To address these
     risks of globalisation, the need to establish a new international
     financial architecture has now become more urgent.

     Establishing a new architecture should aim at crisis prevention,
     providing better mechanisms for risk and crisis management, enhancing
     international financial stability to promote international trade and
     economic development, and intensifying developing countries'
     participation in reforming the international financial architecture.
     Measures should include, inter alia, enhancing the predictability and
     transparency of international capital flows; strengthening the
     framework for national and international regulation and supervision of
     short-term capital flows and introducing safeguards against speculative
     attacks; encouraging burden-sharing between debtors and creditors; and
     improving the role of international lenders of last resort and regional
     financial support mechanisms, including the question of conditionality
     of access to credit from the International Monetary Fund. We believe
     the UNCTAD is well placed to assist developing countries and countries
     with economies in transition in addressing these issues.
     There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and
     significance of Official Development Assistance (ODA), which is a vital
     resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to
     international private capital. Its current level of less than 0.3 per
     cent of GNP, in contrast to the universally agreed target of 0.7 per
     cent of GNP of the developed countries, has to be viewed with great
     concern.

     It should be recalled in this connection that major conferences of the
     United Nations over the last decade, such as the World Summit for
     Social Development and the World Food Summit, were used by the
     international community to proclaim the goal of eliminating absolute
     poverty and improving standards in education, health care and food
     security. Wide-ranging international norms and targets were likewise
     agreed upon for such economic, social and environmental issues as
     enhancement of the role of women, removal of discriminatory practices,
     the rights of children, child labour, access to water and sanitation,
     the safeguarding of forests and biodiversity. We reiterate our view
     that, for these goals to be achieved, a renewed effort to revitalise
     ODA flows to poor countries is crucial.

     We are encouraged by recent decisions to write off the external debt of
     poor developing countries - a measure that the IPU has been
     consistently advocating. It is important to ensure now that these
     decisions are rapidly implemented so that the countries concerned see
     the benefits of debt write-offs as soon as possible. Further
     concessions are required, in terms of both conditionality and the
     volume of debt written off.
     We are convinced that UNCTAD can play a significant role in taking a
     fresh look at the current structure of development finance in order to
     establish mechanisms within the multilateral system and in bilateral
     aid arrangements that prevent the accumulation of external debt by poor
     countries in the future. A decisive shift towards promoting sustainable
     direct foreign investment and providing concessionary finance as grants
     instead of loans is probably the best way of achieving this aim.

     NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND FAIR NEGOTIATION

     Multilateral and international systems - be they in the area of trade,
     finance, social or environmental regulation - should invariably be
     transparent in their design, application and practice. While
     significant advances have been made in recent years in improving
     transparency in some international organisations such as the World
     Bank, there is still a lack of transparency in the decision-making and
     functions of various multilateral bodies. Although membership of these
     organisations is almost universal, some important decisions are taken
     by just a few. Moreover, secrecy surrounds the operation of such bodies
     and access to relevant information is largely confined to governments,
     excluding legislators and civil society.

     Lack of transparency undermines the processes of benign globalisation
     and democratic governance. Multilateral trade concessions gained in the
     past have been the result of intense bargaining and negotiation. To
     advance the cause of free trade is therefore to achieve an environment
     where fair negotiation and fair bargaining can take place in a
     transparent manner without domination by the politically and
     economically powerful. As parliamentarians, we urge UNCTAD and WTO to
     address the issue of transparency and fair negotiation, with full
     participation by all countries, before the world slips back into
     protectionism.

     Multilateral institutions also need to set standards of transparency
     and accountability in their decision-making process and in actions at
     the global, regional and national levels. This is a key issue in the
     management of international trade and finance. Transnational
     corporations should be equally transparent in their practices and
     should be accountable and responsible, especially with regard to
     environmental, labour and social concerns. Particular attention must be
     given to the eradication of corrupt practices in public and corporate
     transactions.

     Finally, we call on the Inter-Parliamentary Union, as the world
     organisation of parliaments of sovereign States, to pursue and
     strengthen its dialogue and cooperation with multilateral institutions
     active in the field of trade, finance and development, in particular
     with WTO, UNCTAD and the Bretton Woods institutions, with the objective
     of providing a parliamentary dimension enabling members of parliament
     to convey the concerns of peoples everywhere to these institutions and
     to assist in forging popular support for their action. Through the
     greater involvement of parliamentarians in global development policy-
     making, the legislative branch will also be able to contribute
     substantively to developing the legislative change and harmonisation
     that are essential to participatory processes of globalisation and
     trade liberalisation.

     PARLIAMENTARY FOLLOW-UP ACTION

     We also recommend that the following measures be adopted by parliaments
     and their members in each country:


     - Ensure that the Final Document of UNCTAD X, as well as the present
         Declaration of the Parliamentary Meeting, are distributed in
         parliament to relevant committees;

     - Equally ensure that these documents are considered in parliaments and
         its relevant standing committees including, wherever possible,
         through plenary debate in parliament;

     - Utilise fully the parliamentary oversight function with a view to
         ensuring governmental follow-up to the outcome of the UNCTAD X.


     Finally, we recommend that parliaments and their members, working
     through their world organisation, the Inter-Parliamentary Union:


     - Invite the IPU Council to endorse this Declaration, thus converting
         it into a policy statement of the IPU on trade, finance and
         development;

     - Request the IPU Secretary General to circulate this Declaration to
         all parliaments represented in the IPU, inviting them to ensure
         that its contents are brought to the attention of all relevant
         parliamentary bodies for their consideration and guidance;

     - Request the IPU to establish a world directory of all parliamentary
         bodies and standing committees that address trade, finance and
         development issues with a view to facilitating the sharing of
         relevant information and experiences among them and with the IPU
         and relevant multilateral institutions;

     - Invite the IPU and UNCTAD to work closely together to raise awareness
         for parliaments and their members on the implications for national
         legislation of specific trade and investment issues and to provide
         assistance in this regard, including through the organisation of
         parliamentary workshops;

     - Invite the IPU to organise a global specialised conference on trade,
         finance and development issues, in cooperation with the relevant
         multilateral institutions, to be convened in Geneva by the end of
         January 2001 at the latest; and

     - Invite the governing bodies of IPU to establish an Ad Hoc Commission
         to look into issues relating to parliamentary follow-up to the
         Third WTO Ministerial Meeting in Seattle and to make appropriate
         recommendations for action.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Labour on Budget Vote 19:
     Labour, dated 14 March 2000:


     The Portfolio Committee on Labour, having considered Budget Vote 19:
     Labour, referred to it, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         The Committee viewed the briefing on the Budget Vote on 7 March
         2000 as an ideal opportunity to interact with the Department, to
         assess whether its work is still on track and to examine carefully
         what the needs are of each programme and what still remains to be
         done.

         This Report records in respect of each Programme of the Department
         and of the Budget Vote as a whole -


         1. a discussion on the 2000-01 budget allocation;


         2. a presentation by the Department made to the Committee; and


         3. the Committee's comments.


         The recommendations in paragraph K of this Report and the
         Committee's comments in paragraph J are directed to the Department
         of Labour as a whole.


     B.     Department of Labour
         The Director-General (Adv Rams Ramashia) and officials from the
         Department briefed the Committee on the Department's 15-point
         programme. The briefing covered programmes that the Department is
         currently focussing on and their relevance to the budget
         (administration, occupational health and safety of persons, social
         insurance, employment and skills development services, labour
         relations, labour policy, and auxiliary and associated services).
         Adv Ramashia said that the Department's activities previously had
         been dominated by policy development, putting in place a new
         legislative framework and setting up new labour market
         institutions. However, the 15-point programme signalled a strong
         shift towards implementation. He said that the Department aims to
         ensure that the range of public services which it delivers, is
         professional and client-orientated. He further outlined the
         Department's key activities for the year, as well as the budget
         allocations. He indicated that the Department's allocation has
         decreased by 10,83%. The Department has been allocated R748,327
         billion for 2000-01, in contrast with the 1999-2000 budget
         allocation of R839,259 billion.


     C.     Programme 1: Administration


         1. Budget allocation


              The allocation for 2000-01 is R154,661 million, which
              constitutes an increase of R26,167 million. The programme's
              allocation has thus been boosted by 20,36%.


         2. Presentation by Chief Director: Administration


              Dr Haasbroek, the Chief Director: Administration, indicated
              that the key focus of the Department's administration would be
              the establishment of a public/private partnership with a view
              to setting up an electronic one-stop service, which would
              underpin the Department's commitment to accessible,
              professional and client-orientated services. He expressed
              confidence that the Department would be ready for the Public
              Finance Management Act, which will come into effect on 1 April
              2000, and said significant groundwork, including training and
              awareness-raising, has been done.


     D.     Programme 2: Occupational Health and Safety of Persons


         1. Budget allocation
              An amount of R36,477 million has been allocated for this
              programme. It is a 26,28% increase on the R28,885 million
              allocated for 1999-2000.


         2. Presentation by Director-General


              The Director-General said that the Department will play the
              leading role in implementing a Cabinet decision to integrate
              occupational health and safety competencies currently under
              the Departments of Labour, of Health and of Minerals and
              Energy. A preventative campaign to promote workplace health
              and safety is to be launched in 2000 to raise awareness and
              build capacity among stakeholders. Special attention will be
              paid to health and safety in small businesses and the informal
              sector. The Compensation Fund will be concentrating on
              improved service delivery through automation and
              decentralisation, as well as on developing policy in respect
              of new areas such as compensation for workers who contract
              HIV/Aids in the workplace and extended coverage for domestic
              workers.


     E.     Progamme 3: Social Insurance


         1. Budget allocation


              An amount of R21,408 million has been allocated for this
              programme for 2000-01. The allocation represents a 1,08%
              decrease on the 1999-2000 allocation of R21,641 million.


         2. Presentation by Deputy Director-General


              The Deputy Director-General, Mr Les Kettledas, said that the
              Social Insurance programme contributes to the Unemployment
              Insurance Fund and compensates workers employed by the State,
              or their dependants, in cases of accidents and diseases
              sustained while on duty. He said the negotiations in Nedlac
              and the passage of the new legislation through Parliament
              would be a priority for the Department this year. The focus
              will be on the social security system. The Department's
              activities in respect of social security need to be co-
              ordinated within the broader development of a comprehensive
              social security system. Regulations and guidelines will be
              improved in order to improve the management of the fund. The
              main focus is on service delivery in order to maximise the use
              of technology, management and training right down to labour
              centre level. The need to minimise fraud with regard to the
              fund is of extreme importance. He also informed the Committee
              that the new UIF Bill has been submitted to Nedlac.


     F.     Programme 4: Employment and Skills Development Services


         1. Budget allocation


              The allocation for 2000-01 is R274,361 million. It constitutes
              a 32% decrease when compared with the 1999-2000 allocation,
              which was R406,285 million.


         2. Presentation by Chief Director: Human Resources Development and
              Employment Services


              Ms Adrian Baird, the Chief Director, stated that much
              attention was focussed on the Department's flagship Employment
              and Skills Development Services programme, which is tasked
              with the implementation of the Skills Development Act and the
              Skills Development Levies Act and which receives more than a
              third of the Department's budget allocation. She further
              stated that the reduction in the allocation for 2000-01 is due
              to the fact that the funding of the National Skills Fund will
              be largely through the implementation of the skills levy from
              April 2000, and that this should not be construed as the
              government not being committed to skills development, but that
              the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) will
              become self-sufficient. She further indicated that the
              Department had driven extensive preparations with stakeholders
              to set up SETAs. This month, the Minister of Labour is
              expected to formally establish 25 SETAs, covering each sector
              of the economy.


     G.     Programme 5: Labour Relations
         1. Budget allocation


              The programme has been allocated R212,861 million, which
              represents a 1,9% increase compared to the 1999-00 allocation
              of R208,937 million. More than half of the allocation
              constitutes a transfer to the Commission for Conciliation,
              Mediation and Arbitration.


         2. Presentation by Chief Director: Labour Relations


              Ms Seftel, the Chief Director, said the main emphasis will be
              on the implementation of the Employment Equity Act, as well as
              on introduction to the amendments to aspects of the Labour
              Relations Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, in
              order to address unintended consequences.


     H.     Programme 6: Labour Policy


         1. Budget allocation


              For 2000-01, the programme has been allocated R33,308 million.
              It is a 33,25% increase on the 1999-2000 allocation, which was
              R24,996 million. The programme is responsible for transfers to
              the National Productivity Institute, which amount to R20,444
              million for 2000-01. The increase is attributed to higher
              spending on personnel, intended to strengthen capacity with
              respect to labour policy.


         2. Presentation by Mr Les Kettledas, Deputy Director-General


              The Deputy Director-General alluded to the fact that a range
              of activities is under way to monitor, analise and disseminate
              labour market information and statistics. The objective is to
              conduct research to assist in monitoring, review and
              formulation of labour market policies so as to ensure that
              policies remain relevant to the developments within that
              labour market. The Department has published a report with
              regard to strike statistics. The programme provides ongoing
              support for activities relating to implementation of job
              summit agreements and other related programmes. It also
              renders assistance to other areas in need of support. There
              is, and needs to be, a close working relationship with
              Statistics South Africa to ensure that statistics are relevant
              to activities in which the Department is engaged. The
              Department is also embarking on research on the incidence of
              "casualisation" in the hospitality and retail sectors, and
              wants to determine the extent and nature of this phenomenon.
              Research is being conducted to determine the impact of labour
              market policies, which would inform future policy formulation.


     I.     Programme 7: Auxiliary and Associated Services
         1. Budget allocation


              The programme has been allocated R15,251 million. This
              constitutes a 23,82% decrease compared to the previous year's
              allocation, which was R20,021 million.


         2. Presentation by Deputy Director-General


              He explained that this programme makes provision for transfers
              to Nedlac and activities relating to International Relations
              which are relevant to labour matters. The decline in the
              allocation is attributed to a shift towards contribution to
              work centres for the disabled and workshops for the blind. He
              said the Department's work in international relations includes
              the Organisation for African Unity's Labour and Social Affairs
              Commission and the African Regional Administration Centre,
              whose focus is mainly on English-speaking countries in Africa
              in order to strengthen labour administration within English-
              speaking Africa. Other areas of work are the International
              Labour Organisation and technical co-operation. In order to
              advocate the establishment of a common regulatory framework on
              labour, employment and related social issues, the Department
              promotes the adoption of the SADC protocol on labour relations
              issues. The Department hosted an SADC conference, where 14
              SADC member states could share their experience with regard to
              labour relations matters and strengthen the capacity of
              independent trade unions and employer organisations. The
              Department appreciates the effort of businesses in South
              Africa to establish a business body to interact with the SADC
              Employment and Labour Sector. They have already been able to
              bring in all the employer bodies.

              Mr Kettledas further stated that technical co-operation should
              complement our national resources, and that they will seek
              additional resources through technical co-operation.


     J.     Committee's comments
         The briefing by the Department indicated a need for the Committee
         to be involved in issues emanating from the Department, especially
         with regard to the Budget. The committee reaffirmed its intention
         to involve itself in the process of the Department, with the
         intention to fulfil its oversight function in a more pro-active
         way. This implies that the close relationship with the Department
         needs to be continued. The Committee raised a number of concerns
         with regard to the individual programmes of the Department as they
         relate to the Budget. The Committee felt that the Department
         should focus on the following issues:


         1. Implementing performance management contracts at all levels in
              the Department, not only at the level of Director-General and
              senior officials.


         2. Integration and powers of inspectors.


         3. Promoting of small business.


         4. Following up on the workplace forums that are in place to
              establish which sectors are lagging behind.


         5. Improving accessibility and client-orientated service in rural
              areas.


         6. Briefing the Committee on what the proposed changes in the
              Basic Conditions of Employment Act entail.


         7. Streamlining the payment method of the Compensation Fund and
              the Unemployment Insurance Fund.


     K.     Recommendations


         In concluding its review of the Budget Vote, the Committee would
         like to emphasise the continuing importance of the Public Finance
         Management Act. Service delivery is crucial to the effectiveness
         of the Department, and the continued effective implementation of
         methods and mechanisms to ensure efficient delivery remains the
         top priority of the provincial offices and the labour centres.
         The Committee therefore recommends that the provincial offices and
         labour centres -


         1. develop and maintain a clear understanding of what is required
              of them in terms of delivery, based on the clearly articulated
              needs of service users; and


         2. carefully engage in, and revise, continuous progress checks to
              ensure that the budget is utilised optimally, and ensure that
              improved services are delivered to the public through the
              implementation of the Department's programmes.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry on Vote 32:
     Trade and Industry, dated 10 March 2000:


     The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, having examined Vote 32:
     Trade and Industry for the 2000-01 financial year, as well as the
     forward estimates for 2001-02 and 2002-03 included in the National
     Expenditure Survey, referred to it, reports as follows:


     A.     The main features of the budget are the following:


         1. The Department has been allocated R2 203,6 million for the
              financial year 2000-01, while forward estimates anticipate it
              receiving R2 264,2 million and R2¬†332,2 million in the years
              2001-02 and 2002-03, respectively, in comparision with the
              R2¬†060,9 million voted and the R2¬†344,6 million actually
              allocated in the Adjustment Appropriation for 1999-2000. The
              Department's budget can thus be described as a constant budget
              with minor fluctuations.


         2. The 2000-01 budget is divided into four programmes, compared to
              10 in the previous budget. These are the following:


              (1) Programme 1 - Administration (4% of the total).


              (2) Programme 2 - Trade, Investment and Entrepreneurial
                  Development (88%).


              (3) Programme 3 - Trade Policy and Global Positioning (1%).


              (4) Programme 4 - Business Regulation and Consumer Services
                  (7%).


              Programme 2, which accounts for the bulk of the Department's
              expenditure, incorporates seven programmes from the previous
              structure: Industrial Sector Strategy, Investment Support,
              Small Business Promotion, Trade Facilitation, Standards and
              Industrial Environment, Technology Enhancement in Industry and
              Policy Analysis and Research.


         3. The budget for Programme 1 is increased from R68,6 million in
              1999-2000 to R86,4 million in 2000-01. This is mainly to
              provide for additional personnel in the executive management
              office.


         4. The budget for activities falling under Programme 2 is
              increased from R1 896,3 million in 1999-2000 to R1 943 million
              in 2000-01. About 33,7% of the funds allocated are for
              investment support, and there is an initial provision of R10
              million for the taxi recapitalisation programme.


         5. The budget for Programme 3 is reduced from R30,6 million to
              R24,3 million, upon conclusion of the European Union
              agreement.


         6. Programme 4's budget is increased from R65,5 million to R144,6
              million, mainly to provide for the costs of establishing and
              running the Competition Commission and Tribunal.


         7. The formal classification of expenditure into the four
              programmes does not permit a ready identification of resources
              allocated to the main activities of the Department,
              particularly those in Programme 2. The Director-General,
              however, indicated to the Committee that the Department
              intends that its resources be deployed in three overlapping
              priority activities: 52% to investment, 43% to Black Economic
              Empowerment and 35% to the promotion of Small, Medium and
              Micro Enterprises.


         8. Transfer payments account for 83% of the total budget. A
              significant part of these transfer payments are made to
              associated "family institutions", including the Industrial
              Development Corporation, the Ntsika Enterprise Promotion
              agency, Khula Finance, the South African Bureau of Standards,
              the Competition Commission, Investment South Africa and the
              Board of Tariffs and Trade.


         9. Approximately R600 million, more than a quarter of the total
              amount allocated to the Department in the 1999-2000 budget,
              remained unspent at the end of the 1999-2000 financial year.
              The Department has requested that a sizeable portion of these
              funds be "rolled over" to provide, inter alia, additional
              finance for the taxi recapitalisation programme and for
              recapitalisation of Khula.


         The Committee had an opportunity to engage on budgetary issues
         with four of the Department's associated institutions: The IDC,
         the CSIR, Ntsika and Khula. Highlights of these discussions are
         set out below.


     B.     Industrial Development Corporation


         1. The IDC provides loan and equity finance to businesses involved
              in industry, tourism and agro-industrial activities. It is
              largely self-financing and pays dividends to its sole
              shareholder, the State.


         2. The IDC was responsible for 7% of the fixed investment in the
              South African economy last year, and is also extensively
              involved in the SADC region. The Corporation envisages
              assisting 350 enterprises in the financial year 2000-01 (a 55%
              increase on the previous year) and expects to approve loans
              and investments of R3,3 billion (an increase of 11%).


         3. The IDC manages, on behalf of the Department, a number of key
              industrial policy programmes as well as the National
              Empowerment Fund.


     C.     Council for Scientific and Industrial Research


         1. The CSIR provides scientific and technological support for
              industrial development. 60% of the CSIR's funds emanate from
              clients and contracts. An amount of a little over R 299
              million is transferred to the CSIR from the budget of the
              Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology via the
              Department of Trade and Industry.




         2. The amount and proportion of the CSIR's budget emanating from
              State funds has been declining. It is envisaged that by 2003
              the CSIR will receive only 30% of its funding from the
              government. There is a debate, both within the CSIR and the
              government, about what the optimum mix should be, and
              international experience in comparable institutions is varied.


     D.     Ntsika


         1. Ntsika is moving towards a greater focus on core activities.
              Its future role depends on decisions that need to be taken in
              view of the ongoing review of the small business support
              strategy. There is also debate within Ntsika as to whether it
              should focus on SMME start-up or business expansion. It has
              decided to tilt its focus towards start-up activities and
              rural enterprises.




         2. There is some uncertainty about Ntsika's present and future
              funding. Its allocation from the Department for 1999-2000 was
              reduced. The Department will provide Ntsika with R80 million
              in the 2000-01 financial year. A further R34,5 million will be
              provided by confirmed donor funding, and R1,9 million will be
              earned as interest. Ntsika estimates that it requires R 312,8
              million to fund activities identified in a needs analysis
              undertaken with provinces and other stakeholders as necessary.
              The agency needs to raise a further R13,8 million to finance
              the more limited programme it has planned for 2000-01.




     E.     Khula


         1. Khula plans to expand its business loans portfolio from R142
              million to R263 million in the course of this financial year.
              Its support programme to Retail Finance Institutions (RFIs)
              has been more successful than the bank guarantee scheme. The
              latter has resulted in only 773 active clients currently being
              served, with 6 184 jobs created.


         2. Experience with RFIs has led Khula to the conclusion that it
              needs to be more prudent with regard to provision for bad
              debts. The organisation has requested R200 million for
              recapitalisation, and says that it cannot operate beyond July
              unless further capital funds are allocated to it. If it
              receives half the amount, it says it will not be able to
              expand its activities. Khula also says it needs R90 million to
              provide service support to RFIs. Without this amount, CEO
              Sizwe Tati says, Khula will have to impose a moratorium on its
              capacity development and operational support to RFIs.


         3. It is not certain that Khula-supported activities are
              sufficiently benefitting target groups in disadvantaged
              communities.


     F.     Comments


         The Department is in the midst of a major reassessment and
         restructuring exercise, and the Committee has had a number of
         opportunities to engage with the Director-General on this. The
         Committee was informed that the format and presentation of the
         budget will be changed in future to give a clearer indication of
         priorities, as well as progress in attaining measurable
         objectives. The Committee has been invited to meet at regular
         intervals with the Department to assess the extent to which
         activities are in line with declared priorities and are achieving
         results.

         The Committee agrees that the format of both past and current
         budgets has not been sufficiently focussed. Expected outputs have
         not been clearly indicated and quantified, with the result that no
         real base to measure impact has been provided. Previous
         assessments of performance have largely relied on vague measures
         of outcome - the number of jobs said to have been created or
         sustained by various programmes. The basis of these calculations
         has, however, not been wholly clear and quantified, measurable
         outputs expected from various activities against which progress
         can be assessed, have not been developed. Thus, while some
         expected outputs are listed in the explanatory memorandum attached
         to the present budget, no quantitative indicators are attached,
         nor are details provided as to how it is intended to match these
         expected outputs with expenditure allocations.

         The Department indicated to the Committee that it is striving to
         achieve greater focus, both in its activities and in the
         reflection of this in its budget. The Department defines its
         fundamental task and strategy as being to grow the economy,
         through the following:


         1. Facilitating access to sustainable economic activity and
              employment.




         2. Raising the level of investment.


         3. Increasing market access.




         4. Promoting a fair, efficient and competitive market place for
              businesses and consumers.


         The Committee was told that, as a result of its consultations and
         discussions with various stakeholders, including the Committee, it
         had chosen to focus its various activities in 2000-01 on three key
         objectives, namely Promoting Small, Medium and Micro-Enterprises,
         Empowerment and Investment.

         The Committee broadly endorses and supports this focus, provided
         of course that sufficient attention is paid to other important
         activities, including critical multi-lateral and regional trade
         relations. The Committee accepts the challenge to engage with the
         Department at regular intervals over the course of the financial
         year to assess progress in achieving these objectives. Clear
         measurable output indicators, that assess impact and relevance as
         well as measure activity, need to be developed as a matter of
         urgency.
         While appreciating and supporting the new course being charted by
         the Department, the Committee is obliged to record its disquiet at
         the large sum left unspent from last year's budget. Although we
         understand that many of the Department's programmes involve
         transfers that cannot be predicted with absolute certainty in
         advance, the large amount that is unspent is, in our view, a cause
         for concern. We do, however, agree that it should also be seen as
         an opportunity. The Department has requested the Department of
         State Expenditure to permit "roll-overs" to support the taxi
         recapitalisation programme, the recapitalisation of Khula,
         incentives and other support for SMMEs. The Committee earnestly
         hopes that these funds are rolled over for such purposes. At the
         same time, we trust that, in the future, provision for such key
         strategic activities as the taxi and Khula recapitalisation will
         be made in the main budget.




     G.     The Committee also draws attention to the following:


         1. Both Ntsika and Khula have indicated that without additional
              funding they will be obliged to reduce their activities. We
              appreciate that the SMME strategy is currently under review
              and that it is the intention that SMME support becomes a
              priority activity and focus for the whole Department and not
              just for specific institutions. The role and scope of
              activities of both Khula and Ntsika may well change, and
              indeed, in our view, needs to change in important respects. At
              the same time, there is evidently a pressing need to expand
              the scope of SMME support. There is thus clearly a need to
              move speedily and decisively on the restructuring of the SMME
              programme and not allow the current uncertainty or budget
              constraints to result in a curtailment of services.




         2. There is need for a wider debate on desirable targets for
              government support for institutions involved in science and
              technology like the CSIR. The CSIR is clearly a valuable
              national asset, and the appropriate level of governmental
              funding for such an institution needs to be established, at
              least in part, on the basis of strategic considerations and
              not merely in the process of competing for scarce fiscal
              resources.


         3. Some evaluation and reassessment of the assignment of the
              management of a number of key industrial policy programmes to
              the IDC need to be made as part of the process of
              restructuring. While the IDC has a pool of professional skills
              and capacities that the Department may not presently have,
              managing such programmes is not the core business of the IDC,
              and the Department has to pay a management fee. There may well
              be a case for continuing to assign such programmes to the IDC,
              but this needs to be reviewed.
