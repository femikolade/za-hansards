sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:

  (1) welcomes the ``DA Rescue Plan for Johannesburg'' which was unveiled
        yesterday ...

[Interjections.]

   (2)      notes that -
        (a)      the Democratic Alliance will lure business back into the
               city and clamp down on crime so that all the people can feel
               safe and benefit from an investor-friendly city; and


        (b)      when the ANC took over the local government in 1995 -


               (i)     the city had 90 ambulances; now there are only 26;
                       and


               (ii)    there was a budget surplus of R92 million, now there

                       R3,5 billion; and

       corporate taxes have been lowered while social spending has
       increased;

       and financial management, despite difficult global conditions; and

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, you are being commended! [Laughter.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:
  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the shocking figures of reported cases which indicate that 61
           910 children were raped in South Africa between 1994 and 1998;

           and gangsters;


  (2) therefore urges the Government to protect our children by imposing
       the most severe punishment on anyone who is guilty of committing a
       crime against a child; and


  (3) appeals to the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure
       that children are brought up in safe environments, so that we can
       give every child the future he/she is entitled to, instead of him/her
       becoming another crime or rape statistic.
Mr S ABRAM: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) recognises -


       (a)  President Mugabe's role in the liberation struggle in Zimbabwe;
           and


       (b)  his role in the development of SADC;


  (2) nonetheless condemns -


       (a)  President Mugabe's role in fanning political violence prior to
           the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe earlier this year; and


       (b)  his recent racist comments that whites in Zimbabwe can forget
           about reconciliation;


  (3) welcomes -


       (a)  President Mbeki's assurance at the Sacob Conference last week
           that Zimbabwean style land-grabs will not happen in South
           Africa; and


       (b) his condemnation of political violence prior to the Zimbabwean
           parliamentary elections; and


  (4) implores President Mbeki -


       (a)  as a respected leader, to display statesmanship in the weeks
           that lie ahead, as threatened demonstrations in Zimbabwe
           escalate; and


       (b)  in view of his stature and involvement in helping to resolve
           disputes, to enter into talks with the official opposition in
           Zimbabwe for that purpose.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock the comments by Mr Peter Marais that Christians
       should choose between the Constitution and the Bible and that the
       Constitution was written by communists under the cloak of democracy;


  (2) believes that these comments are inaccurate and irresponsible;


  (3) reminds Mr Marais that the Constitution was written by a duly-elected
       Constitutional Assembly in which all parties elected to Parliament in
       our first democratic elections of 1994 were represented; and


  (4) calls on the DP and the New NP to distance themselves from this
       statement.

[Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  the report and recommendations by the Standing Committee on
           Public Accounts released on 30 October 2000 regarding the
           Auditor-General's report on the armaments acquisition package;
           and


       (b)  that the Standing Committee on Public Accounts recommends that a
           forensic investigation should be carried out by the following
           agencies:


           (i)   Heath Special Investigating Unit;


           (ii)  Auditor-General;


           (iii) Public Protector;


           (iv)  the Investigating Directorate of Serious Economic
                    Offences; and


           (v)   any other appropriate investigative bodies;


  (2) further notes that the Heath Special Investigating Unit is the only
       agency that requires a special Presidential Proclamation, and calls
       on President Thabo Mbeki to issue the proclamation without further
       delay ... [Interjections.]


  (3) since the committee's report is a complete vindication of a motion
       that I moved in this House on 21 September 1991 calling for a
       judicial commission of inquiry into the arms acquisition, it is
       appropriate that all members of the executive and ANC
       parliamentarians apologise for the personal attack on my integrity.

[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, take your seats. [Interjections.] Are you
rising on a point of order, Mr Landers?

Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker, yes, I am rising on a point of order. I ask
that you rule that the hon De Lille was out of order when she pointed to a
member of this House and said: ``You are corrupt. You are corrupt.''
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Ms De Lille, did you say that?
Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, it was in response to the member calling me
an opportunist.

The SPEAKER: Ms De Lille, did you say that?

Mrs P DE LILLE: I said that, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Would you please withdraw that comment?

Mrs P DE LILLE: I will withdraw now, but I will say it outside again.

The SPEAKER: Ms De Lille, I take it you did not move a motion in 1991,
which is what you said?

Mrs P DE LILLE: No, I moved the motion in 1999. They were making a noise.

The SPEAKER: I misheard you. I wanted to correct you if that was the case.

Someone else stood up on a point of order. Was it you, Mr Oliphant? Is it
the same one?

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Yes.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die VF sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) sy simpatie uitspreek teenoor die Geldenhuys-familie met die wrede en
       sinlose plaasmoord op dr Jurie Geldenhuys van Hartbeesfontein in
       Noordwes;


  (2) die plaaslike gemeenskap, die Kommando en die Polisie loof vir die
       flinke wyse waarop die vyf verdagtes in hegtenis geneem is;


  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat die Noordwes Landbou-unie alle samewerking
       met staatsdepartemente opgeskort het totdat 'n ooreenkoms bereik kan
       word oor wie toegang tot plase kan kry en wie nie; en


  (4) sy afkeer uitspreek van dubbele standaarde by die media en by
       openbare verteenwoordigers waardeur elke wit moord op swart
       voorbladnuus is en as rassisme veroordeel word maar swart moorde op
       wit nie meer nuuswaardig geag word nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FF:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its condolences to the Geldenhuys family on the vicious and
       senseless farm murder of Dr Jurie Geldenhuys of Hartbeesfontein in
       the North West;


  (2) praises the local community, the Commando and the Police for the
       swift manner in which the five suspects were arrested;


  (3) notes that the North West Agricultural Union has suspended all co-
       operation with state departments until an agreement can be reached on
       who may gain access to farms and who may not; and


  (4) expresses its disapproval of double standards on the part of the
       media and public representatives in that every white-on-black murder
       is front-page news and condemned as racism, while black-on-white
       murders are no longer considered newsworthy.]

Mr I VADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the behaviour of Mr Mario Ambrosini in a meeting of the
       Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, and his recording of the
       proceedings without appropriate arrangement with the committee or its
       chairperson;


  (2) believes that his behaviour was unprofessional and undermined the
       integrity of democratically elected public representatives, and is a
       blatant flouting of the rules of Parliament; and


  (3) calls on the Presiding Officers to investigate this matter.

[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, if there is evidence of what you have stated,
regardless of the notice of motion, would you kindly inform the presiding
officers and provide them with that.

Adv P S SWART: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  85 violent crimes are committed every hour in South Africa;


       (b)  150 rapes occur every day;


       (c)  65 people are murdered every day; and


       (d)  267 robberies take place every day in South Africa;
  (2) recognises that the ANC is incapable of protecting South Africans
       from crime; and


  (3) welcomes the commitment of the Democratic Alliance to set up
       metropolitan police forces in all the local authorities it controls
       after the elections to ensure that there are more police patrolling
       the streets of our cities, towns and neighbourhoods for the benefit
       of all the people.

[Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the spiralling costs of medical schemes;


  (2) calls on the Ministers of Health and of Finance to -


       (a)  conduct an audit into the number of people in the country who
           subscribe to registered medical schemes;


       (b)  reconsider the introduction of a national health insurance
           whereby the Government offers a basic package of health
           services;


       (c)  remove the onerous burden placed on medical schemes and regulate
           them only to ensure safe practice and the provision of a
           reasonable minimum service package;


       (d)  allow free and open competition and choice by members of the
           public between national health insurance, pay-as-you-go schemes,
           managed care schemes and medical insurance schemes; and


       (e)  revise the Medical Schemes Act of 1998 so that it can fulfil its
           stated aim of increasing the number of people who subscribe to
           medical schemes.

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that water restrictions are about to be implemented in the
       southwestern part of the Western Cape;


  (2) recognises that the conservation of our most precious and scarce
       resource is critical for the survival of our nation; and


  (3) calls on all the citizens of the country, in general, and the
       southwestern Cape, in particular, to conserve water, to recycle and
       to recognise that every drop counts.

[Applause.]

Mnr C M MORKEL: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:
  Dat die Huis -


  (1) kennis neem van die absolute dilemma wat die arbeidsmark in SA beleef
       in die lig daarvan dat -


       (a)  die nuwe casino-ontwikkeling by Langebaan ongeveer 8 000
           aansoeke ontvang het vir 90 geadverteerde poste; en


       (b)  situasies soos hierdie 'n hartseer weerspieëling is van die feit
           dat Suid-Afrika met 5,88 miljoen werklose mense sit wat die wil
           en die vermoë het om tot die Suid-Afrikaanse ekonomie en hul eie
           lot by te dra, maar dat die geleentheid daarvoor nie bestaan
           nie; en


  (2) 'n beroep op die ANC-regering doen om hul verkiesingsbelofte van 1994
       van ``Jobs for All'' gestand te doen en te erken dat hul nuwe
       verkiesingsbelofte om armoede te beveg, nooit sal kan realiseer
       alvorens hulle werkloosheid in Suid-Afrika aanpak nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the absolute dilemma being experienced by the job market in
       South Africa in the light of the fact that -


       (a)  the new casino development at Langebaan has received
           approximately 8 000 applications for 90 advertised posts; and


       (b)  such situations are a sad reflection of the fact that South
           Africa has 5,88 million unemployed people who have the desire
           and ability to contribute to the South African economy and their
           own destiny, but that they have no opportunity to do so; and


  (2) appeals to the ANC Government to honour their 1994 election promise
       of ``Jobs for All'' and to admit that they will never be able to
       achieve their new election promise of combating poverty until they
       have dealt with unemployment in South Africa.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the razing of the homestead of Mr Tsengwa, the
       aspirant mayoral candidate of the UDM for the Bashe municipality;


  (2) condemns the firing of ammunition into the homestead as it burned
       down;


  (3) notes that while no deaths were incurred, the UDM condemns the fact
       that its members have to jump over corpses to exercise their rights
       to free political activity; and


  (4) calls on Government to protect opposition candidates, particularly
       those from the UDM, who appear to be targets for attack in the run-up
       to the municipal elections.

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the United States has failed to pay its debt of two billion
           dollars to the UN;


       (b)  the US share of the UN budget is 1,11 dollars per citizen, while
           that of a very small country such as San Marino is 4,26 dollars;
           and


       (c)  the US debt is more than the total GDP of some of the poorest
           countries; and


  (2) calls on the US to set the correct moral example by paying and
       honouring its commitments to the UN.

[Applause.]

                      CONGRATULATIONS TO BREYTON PAULSE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:

  (1) notes that the Springbok winger Breyton Paulse was named Player of
       the Year at the Sandton Convention Centre last night;


  (2) concurs with commentators that Breyton is a gifted sportsperson with
       great speed, vision and anticipation; and


  (3) joins his family, friends, colleagues and all South Africans in
       commending and congratulating Breyton on this celebrated award, which
       will serve to inspire more and more black players to emulate him.

Agreed to.

                 DISMISSAL OF MS N M SOMDAKA AND MR D C COOK

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before we proceed I have two announcements
to make. On 24 March 1998 the House, on the recommendation of the Presiding
Officers, approved the appointment of Ms Nomsa Somdaka as Division Manager:
Institutional Support Services of Parliament. On 26 October 2000 Ms Somdaka
was summarily dismissed after a disciplinary hearing.

The facts of the matter, which are generally not in dispute, are that five
staff members performed tasks of a private nature at the house of Ms
Somdaka during official hours, after being transported to her house in an
official vehicle. [Interjections.] Thereafter Ms Somdaka authorised
overtime payment for the staff members. She was found guilty of failing to
exercise due care when approving overtime payment and also for failing to
exercise proper control over the institution's vehicles entrusted to her
care.
Although the chairperson of the disciplinary committee hearing recommended
that she be demoted, the Presiding Officers were of the view that summary
dismissal was the only appropriate penalty. [Interjections.] Mr Cook, the
Superintendent: Property Services, was also summarily dismissed for his
role in the misconduct. Both parties have the right to appeal within five
days of the imposition of the penalty.

            IRREGULAR USE OF TRAVEL FACILITIES BY MR I Z NCINANE

The SPEAKER: Before proceeding with business, I want to deal with a
disciplinary matter concerning the irregular use of travel facilities by a
member of this House. I have asked the member concern to be present. He is
the hon ... I am sorry, I have been practising this: He is the hon Ncinane.
Is he in the House? [Interjections.]

Allegations of the abuse of air travel vouchers by the member first
appeared in the media. When the allegations were published I called the
member to my office and invited his response to the allegations. I was
satisfied that the allegations warranted further investigation, and
accordingly requested the disciplinary committee, chaired by the Deputy
Speaker, to investigate the alleged infringements and advise me on the
appropriate action. I am grateful to the media for their vigilance in
bringing the matter to public notice.

The disciplinary committee conducted a very thorough investigation. I want
to thank the committee and the Deputy Speaker for their work. My decision
in regard to this case is based on the findings and recommendations of the
committee.

Hon member, will you please stand while I address you?

The disciplinary committee found that between May and August this year you,
on 10 occasions, travelled using warrants issued to your children. In
respect of a further seven journeys this year, Parliament paid the full
cost although the journeys were undertaken on travel warrants of minors
under the age of 12. You acknowledged to the committee that you had made
mistakes and that on at least one occasion you knowingly misused travel
warrants issued to your dependants.

Travel benefits are made available to members at public expense, to
facilitate members carrying out their duties and responsibilities as public
representatives. Hon member, I view your deliberate abuse of your travel
facilities in a very serious light. Your conduct is reprehensible in the
extreme. You have abused the public's trust and in the process brought
Parliament into disrepute. In this public forum, I issue a severe reprimand
to you for your inexcusable and reckless conduct.

As there is prima facie evidence of fraud in respect of the identified 10
trips you undertook on your children's travel warrants, I am referring the
relevant information and documentation to the Director of Public
Prosecutions for further investigation. You will repay the cost to
Parliament for the 10 journeys for which you used travel warrants of your
children. You will also repay to Parliament the difference between the
costs to Parliament for the seven journeys ostensibly by adults and the
costs of a journey for a child under 12 years. The moneys involved are to
be paid by 31 December this year. Furthermore, you will forfeit 10 tickets
from your allocation between now and the end of 2001, and the travel
warrants for your dependants are immediately withdrawn for the remainder of
the current year.

Hon member, do you wish to make any statement?

Mnu I Z NCINANE: Somlomo, umBhexeshi weQela elikwisiNinzi nabaBhexeshi
bamanye amaqela, amalungu onke ale Ndlu yoWiso-Mthetho yesizwe, njengoko
sele ethethile uSomlomo, mna ke ndibeka ubhontsi nocikicane, ndaleka
umsundulo. Ndiyazandlala okokhuko lomhambi, ndicela uxolo ngesi senzo
ndisenzileyo. Esi senzo, asele esixelile uSomlomo, esibonakala sinuka
umzondo, isankqanga, iqaqa nesabhongo, bendingasenzi ngenjongo yokunyelisa
le Ndlu, njengomntu olilungu layo nam. Andizi kungena nzulu ke kwizizathu,
koko ndingathi ibe yimpazamo yenene.

Njengoko enqabile amathuba okuba ndithethe kulo mboko ndithetha kuwo ngoku,
ngekuba ndiyavuya, kodwa andivuyi kwaphela, ngenxa yesenzo esibi esibangele
ukuba ndibe ndithetha kuwo ngalo mzuzu. Ngako oko ke ndicela uxolo
ngokungazenzisiyo. (Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Mr I Z NCINANE: Madam Speaker, Chief Whip of the Majority Party, Whips of
the other parties, hon members of the National Assembly, Madam Speaker has
already spoken and made her point. I only stand up to apologise for the
serious act that I committed. I am very ashamed of what I did. I do not, in
any way, wish to undermine the National Assembly, of which I am also a
member. I do not wish to dwell on what prompted me to commit this serious
act, but I can only say that it was a grievous mistake.

One does not often get an opportunity to address you, but I am happy to
have to do that today. However, that does not suggest that I underestimate
the seriousness of the act I committed.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, in conducting its investigations, the
disciplinary committee learned that members' use of travel warrants is open
to abuse. The committee has, therefore, put forward various proposals to
regulate these facilities more effectively and to control related costs. I
am referring to the committee's findings and proposal to the Joint
Subcommittee on Support for Members that they urgently undertake the
revision of travel facilities to avoid future abuses. I am also requesting
the management of Parliament to look into the procedural and administrative
aspects that open the way for abuse. I am sure that, in the circumstances,
members will wholeheartedly support the need for such a revision.

Hon members, the House is about to discuss the steps to be taken to restore
the moral fibre of South African society. It should be clear that the first
such step must be for public authorities to demonstrate, in word and deed,
their commitment to upholding and nurturing a moral society. We can now
return to the item on the Order Paper regarding the steps to be taken to
restore the moral fibre of South African society. I call upon the Deputy
President. [Applause.]

    STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO RESTORE THE MORAL FIBRE OF SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIETY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker and hon members, I rise to introduce a
discussion on a topic that is of great concern to all of us in the country
- the issue of moral degeneration. Moral degeneration is one of the biggest
challenges facing us, and it is at the core of many of the ills in our
society.
This House has, since 1994, abolished various laws that were premised on
the wrong, the bad and the unjust, and championed those that are right and
just. Members of this House have passed laws that ought to contribute to
the consolidation of the fight against moral degeneration. These ranged
from laws dealing with crimes against women and children such as the
Domestic Violence Act of 1998 or the Maintenance Act of 1998, to various
other pieces of legislation aimed at eliminating conditions where
immorality can thrive.

It is therefore appropriate that, as public representatives, we should lead
an attempt to find solutions to this problem. This House has also put
instruments in place to fight corruption, both in the private and the
public sectors. Despite all these and various other endeavours, it is clear
that more still needs to be done as we continue to see signs of moral decay
in our midst.

During the course of this year, the Cabinet discussed this issue and
recognised that many of our socioeconomic problems result, to a large
extent, from moral degeneration. It was decided that the matter should be
addressed as a matter of urgency, and that the Leader of Government
Business should request the Speaker to allow time for this debate. I thank
Madam Speaker for allowing this long-overdue debate to take place.

It is my belief that for us to be able to do justice to this debate, we
need to contextualise the origins of this problem properly. We cannot
resolve it if we treat the symptoms only, and fail to look at the root
causes and the background against which it came about.

To be able to address this challenge as a country, we cannot ignore the
impact that our past has had on our present, for the apartheid legacy not
only dehumanised some communities and individuals, but also caused untold
damage in many other ways. Apartheid created a particular value system
designed to deepen and perpetuate a twisted understanding of values and
morality. It created its own way of interpreting differences between right
and wrong, bad and good, just and unjust, and eroded respect, in general,
and respect for life and property, in particular. It introduced extreme
intolerance, and because it had to be maintained through extreme violence,
it encouraged violence at every level of society.
Apartheid introduced racist policing and training that changed what was
normal to become abnormal. Our history is full of records of how the
apartheid system went to the extent of using criminals for its defence and
maintenance, and how it brutally eliminated opponents, thereby entrenching
a culture of violence. It transformed education into an instrument of
subjugation. It also destroyed good human relations between the different
racial groups and communities in our country.

It is important, in this debate, to recall some of this history and the
fact that as a result of these activities, apartheid was declared by the UN
as a crime against humanity, and by the World Council of Churches as a
heresy. We cannot, therefore, ignore this bitter past when we debate moral
degeneration and when we seek to work for moral renewal.

However, much as we could blame the past as having contributed, to a large
degree, to the moral degeneration of our society, it is important to note
that correcting these wrongs is now a responsibility of all of us in this
House and everyone in our country, South Africa. It is clear that there is
a lot that we need to do to address this as a matter of urgency. To some of
us society seems to have succumbed to low moral values and the symptoms are
there for all to see: disregard for the value of human life and property;
lack of respect and compassion; illegal self-enrichment in both the public
and the private sectors; and other despicable forms of crime such as sexual
abuse of children, particularly by people who are their own flesh and
blood.

We should be grateful that our new laws and the transparency brought about
by our young democracy have encouraged the reporting of sexual crimes, a
social illness that was swept under the carpet in the past. This, of
course, means that democratic South Africa, as distinguished from apartheid
South Africa, has established a firm foundation upon which we can now
correct the wrongs of the past. The greatest concern is that, as South
Africans, we recognise that our value systems have degenerated seriously.
But, at the same time, we seem to find it difficult to act and resolve the
problem.

The intelligentsia in our country, who would normally be expected to lead
in influencing and shaping how we see the world around us, appear to have
fallen victim to the times. They are not all playing their role
constructively. As South Africans, we have come to view as entertainment
some of the negative and immoral depictions of life. For example, some
serialised dramas by some of our broadcast media glorify violence and
criminal activity, giving an impression that this is an acceptable way of
life. These dramas are very popular with thousands of South Africans and
are often their only source of entertainment and information.

The long-term effects of glorifying violence in the mass media are cause
for concern. As parents, we allow our children to listen to and watch these
dramas without guidance, thereby contributing to the perpetuation of this
culture. Our failure to realise the impact of our actions indicates the
level to which we have succumbed to abnormal values. Broadcast and print
media have a tremendous influence, especially on young people. Given this
reality, the media has a crucial role to play in restoring the moral fibre
of our society and should seriously consider the impact of messages that
are being sent out to the public.

The pressure put on children by our permissive and fast-modernising society
cannot be overemphasised. I recall the painful incident in Chatsworth where
the lives of young children came to a tragic and premature end in a night
club. I am haunted by the words of an 11-year-old girl told to me by a
police officer who was at the scene. Moments before she died she pleaded
with him, and I quote: ``Uncle, please do not tell mummy that I was here.''
Those were her last words. As parents, we now compete with many negative
social influences as we try to mould the adults of the future. The words
from this young child indicate that at home they do not encourage her to do
what she did. The question is: What can we do to restore the moral fibre of
our nation and to restore the type of values that would hold our families
and communities together?

Members of this House, the provincial legislatures and local government
must lead the nation in debating this issue. We must declare the moral
regeneration campaign as a major national campaign. All political parties
represented in government at all levels and in this House must give this
matter the urgent attention it deserves. It must become a major priority in
our constituencies. This campaign should aim at reaching out to the very
soul of our nation. It is important therefore that we should agree in this
House to drive it jointly and not use it for political point-scoring.

We also need to mobilise all sectors of our society to work jointly with us
to eradicate this moral decay. We invite the religious sector to play a
leading role in providing a spiritual and moral revival. After all, this is
their main mission in society. Let our pulpits, synagogues, mosques and
temples intensify the preaching of the message of a moral rebirth and
renewal in South Africa.

South Africans in general cannot escape this responsibility either. There
was a time in our history when people would provide guidance to children
they did not even know, when the ruling ethic was ``Any child is my
child''. We need to revive that spirit. When one sees children loitering in
the streets during school hours, what does one do as an adult? Does one ask
them why they are not in school or does one simply walk away as if nothing
has happened? Awu Bakithi, lafa elihle kakhulu. [Oh my countrymen, cry the
beloved country.] What will happen to these children in the future?

Our young people are more vulnerable to the demands of this new era, and
the popular culture of the time does not promote good  morals. Hon members,
one need only watch the youth music programme, Channel O, and other hugely
popular prime time programmes, to see the particular culture that is being
promoted among our youth. It is one that continuously promotes sex and
violence.

The values we teach to our children will determine the kind of society we
will have in future. For this reason, we need to start in our homes and
schools to develop new South Africans who understand what it means to be
respectable and respectful citizens. A youth that is patriotic and has
national pride and self-respect is less likely to engage in immoral and
antisocial activities.

This is a challenge for youth organisations in our country to begin to
instil a new moral ethos in their members. Political youth organisations
must give the lead in this regard. They need to promote moral renewal
amongst their members and potential members, and make it fashionable, once
again, to be morally upright. It is clear that there is a lot that we need
to do to ensure a moral revival and the nurturing of a new South Africa
with good values of self-respect, respect for the next person, respect for
human life and property, and most of all, national pride.
This debate is a milestone that adds value to our nation-building efforts.
I would therefore like to make an earnest appeal that we give the matter
serious thought, and that a way be found to concretise our conclusions. If
we all agree that it is important to take visible action, we need to pass
resolutions and embark on a programme of action that will enable us to
fulfil this responsibility. We must not disappoint our fellow South
Africans. [Applause.]

Sister B NCUBE: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and the House, the
Collins English Dictionary describes morals as the ability to distinguish
between right and wrong. This definition does assist to determine the
solution to the issue of moral decay in our society.

My focus, in this debate, will mainly seek to highlight a few positive
suggestions in the struggle to build our country's moral fibre by a mass
educational campaign. Amid much doom and gloom, there is still hope.
Schools, roads and clinics continue to be built, housing subsidies are
issued, electricity and telephone lines are connected, and water taps are
installed. These achievements, however, must not let us be complacent for
if the moral fibre continues to fall apart, our young democracy could also
be on the road of little reason for optimism for the future.

The greatest challenge that our society is facing is to deal effectively
with poverty at the economic and social levels, and to build a moral fibre
to strengthen the moral responsibility in all our societal sectors of life.
The nation needs moral guidance. Society looks to the governmental
institutions, religious institutions and the industrial organisations of
society, specifically in the midst of our present moral decay, for moral
guidance. However, none of these social institutions can go it alone. They
need a collective approach to have a comprehensive impact to embrace the
whole of human life for development, empowerment and sustenance.

In order to provide moral guidance, these social institutions must make
their stands and intentions clear, and never tire of explaining and
dialoguing about the methods of building the moral fibre in our South
African society. They must help people to understand their constitutional
rights and their obligatory duties towards those rights. There must be no
misunderstanding about the moral duty of all South Africans in the building
of a new value system of ubuntu, for ``motho ke motho ka batho''.

These social institutions, over and above their specified regular business
activities, would need to have special programmes, projects and campaigns
of special needs of the struggle to build the country's vision of a
nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa. Nothing could be more
relevant and more necessary, at this moment of moral crisis and decay in
our society, than a message of hope to restore courage and fearlessness
that the vision of a better life for all will be fulfilled as the psalmist,
in Psalm 9:18 says: ``... the hope of the poor is never brought into
nothing''.

Finally, I am asking everybody in this House to recommit themselves to the
RDP of the soul, as called for by our former President, Nelson Mandela, to
lead the way by starting initiatives to entrench morality as a way of life.
It is not enough to make public statements on the matter. Actions speak
louder than words!

In die weskant van Gauteng glo ons in die slagspreuk van die ANC wat sê: Al
die mag vir ons mense! [Applous.] [In the western part of Gauteng we
believe in the slogan of the ANC which states: All the power for our
people! [Applause.]]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, hon colleagues, surely, the question that we
need to ask this afternoon is why we are debating the subject of morality
in our Parliament six years after 1994. Let me take hon members back to
about 1993 when many of those who are here now as members of Parliament
were locked in negotiations, attempting to dream a dream for South Africa,
and attempting to have a vision of where we would like to be as a people
and as a group in five or six years' time.

Surely, today we can stand here and ask ourselves: Regarding those dreams
and visions that we had and where we expected to be, have we, at this
juncture, arrived at that point where we should have been, or have we
slipped or fallen back in many respects? And, regarding the many things
that we hoped to be able to achieve as a result of those negotiations, did
they come to pass or did we fail?

This question is important because it goes to the heart of what the new and
modern South African society is about. There is no point in attempting to
moralise in a top-down fashion. We need to look at what is happening in a
bottom-up fashion, if we need to regenerate society. If, at the bottom, the
situation is as dismal as it was six or seven years ago, if those who
suffered the ravages of disenfranchisement and lack of opportunities and
resources during the period of apartheid are still experiencing these
things, and if the rural hinterland of South Africa has not experienced any
substantial changes, then we have not achieved our goal.

Sister Bernard Ncube spoke of the RDP of the soul. Did that change
materialise in South Africa or has self-interest once again become the
dominant moral tendency within the nation, where so long as the individual
is well-off, it does not matter what is happening to the remainder of
society? Now, if that situation continues to prevail, no matter how much we
moralise from here, and if our efforts make no impact or change in the
lives of ordinary people, then the ordinary people have no reason to buy
into the new philosophy and the new democracy, because they have no further
virtue in respect of ordinary people.

This question therefore needs to be looked at very profoundly, because we
go back again to the question of ubuntu. If my peace, my happiness and my
family are going to have any future, that future, surely, cannot be a right
on its own, but has to be interlinked with that of someone else's. The fact
that our President has continued to characterise our society as two
societies, namely one that is well-off and one that is struggling and poor,
raises the question of morality again.

Why is it that six years after the new democratic Government the poor
continue to remain poor? Why is it that the uneducated continue to remain
uneducated? Why is it that the benefits of technology, which is the most
important tool in the hands of modern human beings, are in the hands of a
dominant few? When will there be a transfer of skills, resources and
knowledge to those who have not had them in the past, in order that they
can build, on the basis of what they have, a new society which is more
equal. So long as society remains unequal, so long as that happens, we will
not be in a position to preach morality because the ordinary person will
still ask: What benefits have flowed out of what you have done for me?

Now for the forthcoming election the Democratic Alliance has the theme:
``For all the people.'' We need to ask whether that, in fact, will
materialise, and whether it is going to mean a good education for all the
people, including the people in the rural areas. Will it mean good housing?
Many of these people were the people who had ample opportunity over 40 or
50 years, when they were in government, to make sure that black people,
coloured people and Indian people would have been able to get these
benefits. [Interjections.] [Applause.] Did we get those benefits? That is
the question we need to ask. [Interjections.]

What was the quality of education that was given to us? If today there are
people who are not able to enjoy good jobs and not able to get into top
positions, it is simply because of what they inherited.

Now here we have Douglas Gibson. Let us take Douglas Gibson, for example.
Should Douglas Gibson ... [Interjections] ... should he ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, order! Would you please take your seat?
Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, may I ask the hon member where the jobs are
that his Government has promised? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Mr Gibson, would you take your seat please? [Interjections.]

Mr M F CASSIM: The question I would like to ask the hon ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Mr Gibson, I am not recognising you. When I did ask
you, you could have risen on a point of order. I am not recognising you.
[Interjections.] Please proceed, hon member.

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, the question that I would like to ask ...
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, are you only rising on a point of order?

Mr C AUCAMP: I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Yes, Mr Aucamp.

Mr C AUCAMP: I just want to ask whether it is appropriate, in a debate on
the moral values of our country - the Deputy President asked us not to
politicise this, and I do not see any morality issue in this – to ...
[Interjections.] I want to say it is not in order. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, you may make that point in your speech.
Please proceed, hon member.

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Speaker, now the question that I am addressing is a
question of high morality. When one says publicly: ``For all the people'',
we need to ask the question here honestly whether it is going to be for all
the people, and what it is that is going to be delivered to all the people.
[Interjections.] Can we get an assurance from the hon Douglas Gibson, when
he comes here, that, indeed, when he says, ``For all the people'' and
wishes to embrace all the people, that it is not merely hypothetical, but
genuine embracing of all the people? [Interjections.]

Now, particularly in this country, we need to look at the disadvantaged
black community. In that community the suffering is intense and it is
immense. [Interjections.] What is the Government doing? We are all part of
Government. [Interjections.] Now, let me tell the hon Douglas Gibson ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: [Inaudible.]

Mr M F CASSIM: ... if the hon Douglas Gibson would listen to this. In
Malaysia the opposition parties have an agreement with the ruling party
that, because they want to build Malaysian society and uplift the poor, in
five areas of human endeavour, which include education, health and housing,
they will work together. [Interjections.] Now, what has the hon Douglas
Gibson done here this afternoon? [Interjections.] He has created a
division.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon Mr Cassim, would you take your seat?

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker, I would ask you to rule that the hon ...

The SPEAKER: Are you rising on a point of order?

Mrs S A SEATON: Yes, on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I would ask you to
rule that the hon Douglas Gibson give our speaker an opportunity to speak.
He can speak when it is his turn.  [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon member, would you take your seat? Order! I want to say to
this House that what is happening now does not add to the decorum of the
debate, nor does it indicate any seriousness. The Chief Whips, if I may say
so, ought to lead the way in setting the tenor of the debate. [Applause.]
Hon member, will you please resume your speech.

Mr M F CASSIM: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The question that was addressed by
the hon Douglas Gibson to me is a fair question. His question was: What is
your Government doing? My answer is that where people are committed to
uplifting the poor, they do not apportion responsibility to someone else.
[Interjections.] What they do is say: I am also willing to come in and
assist in this most important task, in order that people believe us, not
because of what we say to them, but because of what we do. [Applause.]

If, therefore, people are in privileged positions, to the extent that I, as
an Indian, am privileged and in a position of having had more benefits than
others, the question that should then be posed to me and my group of people
is: What are you now going to contribute in order that your relationship
with the rest of the people of South Africa can be built up on the basis of
not only promising, but standing side by side with them and saying,
``Together we shall build. Together we shall set off upon the road that we
would like to travel on.'' [Applause.] When we do that, we make the highest
statement of morality, and that is that when I have something to give I
offer it willingly and freely, because I know that if our society builds up
on the basis of equal strength, then all of us are liberated, then all of
us are delivered.

At the moment, freedom has come to our country, but who is it that is
really free. Who is enjoying economic freedom and still enjoying the total
freedom and luxury of the best education, the best housing and the best
medical care? Can that situation prevail? Can we say to other people: Let
us believe in morality, but for you there must be second-class health,
education and whatever else, and it is fine for someone else to enjoy those
things at a much higher level. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, 1994 heralded an era in which South
Africans would be able to make their own choices, where before there had
been laws and rulebooks which dictated our every action. Today we live in a
world where people question long-held beliefs, question certain aspects of
their own faith and, generally, take more responsibility for their own
choices and decisions.

However, in this new environment, we also find disturbing trends. We often
find that respect between individuals and communities is the victim. The
well-known philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville remarked: ``Liberty cannot be
established without morality, nor morality without faith.''

When debating, in the political arena, the issue of moral fibre in the
South African society, one has to establish the boundaries of this debate.
Firstly, no individual or party can claim exclusive ownership of morality.
We will get much further with the debate if we accept the notion that
decency and morality, and also sometimes the lack thereof, exist in all
parties. What is absent in South Africa is the willingness to accept,
recognise and acknowledge decency across political and other dividing
lines. Our public discourse will be much more constructive if we accept
that to acknowledge that in the other camp one can also find decency and
morality is a strength and not a weakness.

Secondly, indicators which prove conclusively that we live in a country
whose values are steadily turning upside down, are becoming too many to
ignore. With regard to crime against children, rape has increased by 108%
since 1994. Assault against children ... [Interjections.] I can tell the
Minister that I get these statistics from his own department's reports.
Assault against children increased by 111%. These are the statistics.
Behind these statistics lurks the ugly face of what is increasingly
happening to many children in our country.

Just last week a newspaper reported the story of little Manual Makwe's
first five years of hell before he died of abuse at the hands of, inter
alia, his own mother. The court found that Manual had had a piece of flesh
removed from his groin while he was still alive. He had been battered,
pulled by his hair and legs for distances and burnt with open flames. He
was bashed against a wall, leaving him unconscious, and for this had water
poured over his face to wake him up. The boy was even force-fed an
unidentified liquid that had made his stomach swell. He had been beaten to
a pulp at intervals, leaving him with broken bones which were never
treated.

It is when the statistics are given faces and names, and their stories are
told, that people can begin to understand what is happening out there.
There are many Manual Makwes out there, from poor families and from
affluent families. I want to tell Mr Cassim that when one is confronted
with experiences like these, the question of DA or ANC or IFP fades into
the background.

People simply want to know what is happening to our country. What are the
political leaders doing to rectify the situation. And the question is:
``What are we doing?'' Are we having another debate trying to apportion
blame, or are we taking concrete action which will save many Manual Makwes
in future?

Moral decay cannot be seen as a cause; it is instead a symptom of deeper
social and community problems. If we are to address moral decay, we must
first understand the underlying social causes.

Let us look at what poverty is doing to the moral fibre of our society. In
our country one in four children goes to bed hungry. Even more of their
mothers are starving because they sacrifice the little food they have to
feed their children. One in four households spends less than R50 a week on
food. Many of us who come from communities which were once poor grew up
with the advice of our elders that one can be poor, but one can be proud
and decent at the same time.

Poverty cannot be an excuse for being morally corrupt, but it is
presumptuous to preach to people who are living in abject poverty, going to
bed hungry almost every night, about abstract moral values without offering
them hope. When people are poor, they must be given hope that there is a
way out. When one has to figure out every day how to keep body and soul
together, but more than that, how to devise a plan to ensure that one's
children do not go to bed hungry, then concepts such as Government
corruption, accountability and nepotism sound as if they refer to another
planet.

Providing real hope in the sense of concrete job opportunities is the only
answer to the endemic poverty in our country. Poor people are proud people
who aspire to a decent living. They want to trust the undertakings of
politicians of all persuasions.

Daar is talle gevalle waarin staatsamptenare en politieke ampsdraers aan
korrupsie skuldig bevind word deur kommissies of regeringsondersoeke, maar
dit word nooit verder gevoer tot in die hof en tot by skuldigbevindings
nie.

Daar is 'n gees los dat mense geregtig is op wat hulle wil vat. Daar is
talle voorbeelde, maar as ons in 'n land sienderoë toelaat dat 'n
provinsiale premier soos in Mpumalanga mense aanstel as ministers wat deur
'n kommissie van ondersoek ongeskik bevind is om 'n openbare pos te beklee,
dan moet ons vra hoeveel van die skade aan moraliteit nie dalk
selfaangerigte skade is nie.

Geen party is vry daarvan dat mense op 'n onbehoorlike wyse optree nie. Die
vraag is hoe daar in sulke gevalle opgetree word. Word dit weggepraat? Word
verskonings daarvoor gesoek? Of word daar moeilike besluite geneem en
opgetree, selfs al is daar politieke skade? (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[There are many instances of public servants and political office-bearers
being found guilty of corruption by commissions or government
investigations, but the culprits are never taken to court and convicted.

The general attitude is that people are entitled to take what they want.
There are many examples of this, but if we as a country blatantly allow a
provincial premier, as in the case of Mpumalanga, to appoint people who
have been found unfit to hold public office by a commission of inquiry as
Ministers, we have to ask ourselves how much of the damage to morality may
not be self-inflicted.

There is no party in which people are not acting in an improper way. The
question is what action is being taken in such cases. Is it being explained
away? Do people try to find excuses for it? Or are difficult decisions and
steps being taken, even if there is political damage?]

In conclusion, there are no magic formulas to restore the moral fibre of
our society. The essence in restoring the moral fibre lies in respect
between individuals and communities. It is the absence of respect which
leads to our children being abused, women being raped, Government money
being stolen, and poor people being exploited and used as political fodder.

The answer lies in a government whose institutions can deliver justice,
courts which are working, a well-functioning police force and a government
that is responsive. But the picture can only be complete when there is a
strong civil society guarding that which is good. But the key to all of
this is leaders in government who show the ability to distinguish between
right and wrong, and to act upon that knowledge. [Applause.]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Madam Speaker, hon members, unlike the Deputy Chairperson
of Committees, I will try to behave myself this afternoon.

Many of us may recall the story of a naval battleship that came across a
light directly in front of it during a storm in the middle of the night.
After numerous attempts to persuade the other vessel to change course, the
captain sent a message informing the crew of the other vessel that he was
the captain of a battleship, maybe a new corvette, and would ram them out
of the way if they would not change course. The reply that he received from
the crew of the other vessel was: ``We are a lighthouse.''

Just as a lighthouse protects ships during darkness and storms, when they
are in danger of losing direction and landing on the rocks, so too do the
norms and values that make up the moral fibre of society protect it from
decay and ruin. In this respect, South Africa has a dismal history. Our
history conjures up images of places such as Robben Island, Vlakplaas and
Quatro, and names such as, among many others, Steve Biko, Hector Petersen
and Stompie Seipei.

After years of institutionalised discrimination and terror, the country
looked forward in 1994 to a future in a society, and here I would like to
quote former President Mandela's inaugural speech -


  ... of freedom in such a manner that it guarantees the political
  liberties and the human rights of all our citizens.

Instead of this vision, we have a society that is drifting around
perilously in a sea of crime, corruption and immorality.

In South Africa, 2 058 violent crimes are committed daily. This amounts to
85 violent crimes every hour. In 1998, 49 280 rape cases and 4 851 sexual
assaults were reported - a total of about 54 000 incidents. Many such cases
still go unreported owing to fear of reprisal and shame.

In 1999, 23 810 murders were reported - 65 per day. Between 1994 and 1999
the reported cases of robbery increased by 121,2%, with about 11 robberies
with aggravating circumstances taking place every hour. Many of these
incidents are carried out against the most vulnerable of our society, the
aged, the disabled and minors. It is such people that need our protection
the most.

The primary task of any government is to protect its citizens. But how does
a government do this? A government protects its citizens by drawing up and
implementing policies through legislation, if necessary, that create an
environment in which the constitution, and specifically the bill of rights,
is nurtured and protected. In other words, it creates a moral society with
discipline and respect for law and order and a society that caters for and
protects diversity of religion and culture. With this in mind, our
Constitution seeks to establish a society based on democratic values,
social justice and fundamental human rights.

It is, however, values, justice and human rights that have been abused in
our society, not necessarily by government, but by the lack of it. A survey
by the Institute of Security Studies indicates that while 10% of South
Africans felt unsafe in society in 1994, this figure grew to almost 50% in
1999. This figure, in fact, implies that almost 50% of South Africans do
not believe that Government is able to carry out its basic task of
protecting them. With the high rates of crime, corruption and nepotism, the
latest decision to release instead of incarcerate and rehabilitate
prisoners, the President's attitude to the views of democracy in Zimbabwe
and the whole approach to HIV/Aids, this Government is to morality what
Colonel Saunders is to chickens. [Interjections.]

What is more worrying than just crime is the breakdown of the family and
the status of our youth. [Interjections.] Our future lies in the hands of
our youth, many of whom are on the streets sniffing glue, begging and
committing some of the most heinous crimes. Those who are fortunate enough
to have homes spend hours watching television advertisements, programmes
and films that are often violent and obscene. It would seem that the
valueless and immoral words of William Golding's Lord of the Flies and
Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange have become a reality among our youth.

We are aware that South Africa is a society in transition. We are between
traditional and modern worlds. While traditional societies are disciplined,
with strict values and morals, and modern societies have stability and
agreements over these aspects, a transitional society is characterised by
the lack of consensus over issues of morality, values and rules of
behaviour. Such societies need guidance and discipline from their
governments if they are to move forward and transform themselves.

Up until now governments in South Africa, both past and present, have been
unable to transform our society and establish acceptable rules of
behaviour. Instead, they became and have become absorbed by that which they
were meant to transform. On the other hand, individuals and institutions in
South Africa do a great deal to uphold our religious and civic values.
Every institution that instructs citizens on their democratic rights and
responsibilities, every parent and teacher who takes the time to discuss
religious and moral issue with our children, every person that reports a
crime, every young person that remains faithful or abstains instead of
using a contraceptive device to prevent Aids, keeps morality alive in South
Africa. These are the people that we must emulate, and these are the people
that we salute this afternoon. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! The hon Grové will speak from his seat at the
back of the House.

Mr S P GROVÉ: Madam Speaker, what distinguishes people from animals is the
fact that we have an inner thought world that is as real to each of us as
the physical world in which we live. In that thought world we create
perceptions of everything around us, and that is the way we perceive life.
These perceptions are very important things, as whether we realise it or
not, they dictate the way we behave and therefore our morals. There is a
saying that goes: ``You are what you think.''

One aspect of moral behaviour is, to my mind, a relatively simple concept,
and that is the respect or lack thereof for the dignity of one's fellow
human beings. What then, in one's thought world determines whether one has
respect for the dignity of others? The answer to that question can only be
that I will respect the dignity of others if I have the perception that
others respect mine. That is the way human beings behave and have behaved
since the beginning of time.

What this whole argument amounts to is that our relationships with our
fellow citizens, with Government, with our employers, with everybody around
us with whom we interact in our daily lives, will to a very large extent
determine our moral behaviour. That is also the reason it will never be
possible for the Government alone to reverse or solve the moral decline. It
is the responsibility of every person in this country to re-examine their
relationships with their fellow citizens and do their utmost to treat those
with whom they interact with respect and dignity.

I want to look briefly at some tools that we can use to repair our
interpersonal relationships and to restore respect for the dignity of other
persons. First of all, is surely the concept of reconciliation. This must
be one of the most important and also one of the most misunderstood
concepts in South Africa. I fail to understand why so many white people in
South Africa think that reconciliation is something that black people must
do after white people have said that they are sorry. If that does not work
in my marriage it will definitely not work in the country. I cannot, after
years of abusing my wife, go to her and simply say that I am sorry and
thereafter think that everything will be all right from that moment
onwards.

Reconciliation is something that must be lived. It is a process. I am not
suggesting that one group should grovel before another - far from it. I am
suggesting that for reconciliation to work people need to experience it
from both sides, and we have to live reconciliation and prove it in our
daily actions. That is the moral way in which to behave and the way in
which we will create dignity for ourselves.

The second issue is that of redress. We live in one of the most unequal
societies on earth, a situation which is in itself immoral. There is
without doubt a moral obligation on those who benefited from the past to
contribute to the redistribution process to redress this inequality. That
act in itself will go a long way in giving people back their dignity and
hope, and stop them feeling like second-class citizens.

The third issue is rebuilding. There is an obligation on the whole country,
on every person, to rebuild this country. That not only means that all of
us must have equal access to education, to the economy and to land, but
also that we have to recreate the will to do things for ourselves. Too many
of us are sitting around waiting for the Government, or some or other
person, to do something for us. It is time that we all get stuck in and do
some honest work to rebuild not only our nation but also our own lives. The
satisfaction of achieving some goal, however modest, is a sure way of
restoring our own dignity.

Lastly, I want to say, regarding the election, that it seems to me that
once again some groups in the opposition parties have a tendency to cause
polarisation among voters. To erect once again quixotic windmills in the
form of some or other kind of ``gevaar'' to attract voters, is not going to
do our nation any good and it is in no way going to contribute to the
restoration of dignity. [Laughter.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Madam Speaker, the Deputy President's decision to invite a
debate on the challenge of moral renewal in our society is a proper
recognition that all is not well in our country. We commend him for his
insight, honesty and candour and hope that the Government and opposition
parties alike will welcome this and will contribute in a constructive
manner.

Our point of departure is an acknowledgement that our society carries the
scars of an immoral legacy which spawned antisocial attitudes and
tendencies, the suffocation of the human spirit, the stifling of free
thought and expression, and constrained the full development and
flourishing of the talents of our youth. This suppressed energy found an
outlet in self-destructive social aberrations and nurtured a noxious
violent spirit and nihilism.

In case people from the ranks of the opposition parties have not read much
on this aspect of how the youth in our country in the run-up to 1976 was
forced into a very painful situation, I would like to recommend a piece by
the late Ruth First in the journal Review of African Political Economy, and
a reply to this analysis by a noted South African black scholar, Prof
Archie Mafetje. Prof Ruth First argued in that article that the youth
responded to the painful oppression in this country because of specific
directives from a particular political party. She is partially correct.
Prof Archie Mafetje, in a rebuttal to this, argued that the youth, as part
of a broader liberation movement, responded to directives from a particular
political party, but went beyond this. It is highly recommended reading.

Our democratic Constitution provides a framework for the seeding and
flourishing of human values. Our Bill of Rights, which is enshrined in this
Constitution, is the guiding beacon which should keep us on the straight
road and never again should we relapse into the quagmire of our past.

Alas! If wishes were horses, beggars would ride. The Constitution and its
democratic institutions alone are inadequate to guarantee the growth of a
culture founded on sound moral values. It will take a collective team of
leaders in Government, the private sector and our communities, who possess
unquestionable integrity and the moral fibre to rise above the murky waters
of an acquisitive and self-aggrandising society. We have to exalt the
primacy of the universal and timeless values of selflessness, generosity,
honesty, uprightness and dedication to duty. We must be a hard-working and
proud people who do not seek hand-outs and unprincipled opportunities for
self-aggrandisement.

These values cannot flourish in a vacuum. Government and the private sector
must create an empowering economic environment which generates job creation
and effectively eliminates conditions which breed crime and the erosion of
moral values. The economic policies pursued currently by Government are not
designed to achieve these objectives. Leaders in Government, parastatals
and the private sector have developed a culture in which the leadership
scrambles for the acquisition of existing wealth without creating more for
redistribution amongst the historically marginalised poorest of the poor.

The UDM believes that the restoration of the culture of learning, for
example, is a very important priority in the renewal of moral values in
society, and the reprioritisation of the fight against crime is the first
priority of the Government and all stakeholders in society, including the
opposition parties, so that our society can be seen as a safe place to
visit.

We must engage law-enforcement departments to ensure that they restore
civil order and security to a society that is besieged by unprecedented
levels of crime, which have earned South Africa the unacceptable and
uncoveted title of ``world crime capital''. We must take all necessary
practical measures to empower civil society to reclaim the streets in our
neighbourhoods and make them safe havens where people can raise their
children without fear.

Rev K R J MESHOE: Madam Speaker, I want, firstly, to echo what the Deputy
President said as he opened this debate. Secondly, I want to propose eight
steps that should be taken to restore the moral fibre of South African
society.
Firstly, the church leaders, especially, must be told to stop trying to be
politically correct. They should start confronting evil without fear or
favour, telling the truth even when it hurts and leading our communities by
example.

Secondly, we must acknowledge that the problems of moral decay are too big
and complex to solve without the help of Almighty God. Without Him,
Government cannot change the moral rot that we now have, and without His
help even moral summits that we call all the time will not help.

Thirdly, we have to admit that radical change has to take place in the
hearts of individuals and that only Jesus Christ has the power to change
our hearts thus enabling us to change our attitudes and immoral behaviour.

Fourthly, we should ensure that this Parliament passes legislation that
promotes morality and not immorality. Fifthly, we must review legislation
that has legalised deadly and addictive pornography that encourages
promiscuity. Sixthly, we should instruct all levels of Government to stop
legitimising immorality by attempting to legalise prostitution.

Seventhly, we should be proactive by using television to educate our people
about the dangers of immoral living and the advantages of clean moral
living. Eighthly, we should encourage the SABC to show more programmes with
a strong moral content than programmes that glorify sin and immorality.

King Solomon once said that righteousness exalts the nation but sin is a
disgrace to any people. South African politicians must heed the words of
King Solomon if they are serious about tackling the moral decay that is
fast destroying the foundation of this nation.

The ACDP wants to see morality and righteousness restored in this nation,
that is why we will always oppose the glorifying of sin and the immoral
laws that are either passed or contemplated by this Parliament. We will,
instead, support and promote righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ
at all levels of society.

This Parliament must resolve to make a u-turn and start leading our people
by example in the ways of righteousness. If we want to secure the future of
our children we have no option but to take drastic steps to reverse the
unacceptable downward moral trend in our society. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, may I
say ``Amen'' after the Rev Meshoe's sermon.

On the morning of 10 May 1994 the Republic of South Africa irrevocably
entered a new phase of history when the first democratically elected
President was inaugurated at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. The world
acclaimed the bloodless revolution that had taken place at the southernmost
tip of Africa.

In the years that followed, a Constitution was drafted, a Constitution
considered to be one of the best in the world, and this Constitution was
adopted on 8 May 1996. This was the first phase of our revolution, a
transfer of political power from the minority to the majority. The second
phase was to undo the decades of injustice, oppression and degradation of
our people. A phase of transformation and consideration had to take place,
perhaps a much more difficult task than we had anticipated.

We are now challenged by the third and, perhaps, the most difficult phase
of our revolution, the restoration of the moral fibre of South African
society. If we are going to be faithful to our wonderful Constitution, can
we applaud those individuals who defraud the state by evading paying taxes,
smuggling goods and selling addictive drugs? Can we permit stealing,
hijacking and murder? Can we tolerate parents forcing their young daughters
to sell themselves for the sexual gratification of others? Can we condone
the gang rape of innocent girls and elderly grandmothers? Can we be
comfortable and sleep soundly when defenceless children are brutally
assaulted by drunken parents? The answer is an emphatic ``No''.

If we allow the above we will become part of a sick and decadent society, a
society not fit to survive. We will be dishonouring those valiant boys and
girls, men and women who so heroically struggled to bring about the just,
fair and free society that we live in today. No particular group or party
has a monopoly on maintaining moral, ethical and spiritual values, and here
I agree with the previous speaker. Individually and collectively, we must
engage in a soul-cleansing exercise. In the words of John Adam, the Nobel
Peace Prize laureate of 1931, and I quote:
  In his own way each man must struggle lest the moral law becomes a far-
  off abstraction, utterly separated from his active life.

In addition, our criminal and justice systems must be invigorated so that
those elements in our society who indulge in deviant behaviour will think
twice before participating in immoral and antisocial acts, particularly if
these arise not out of necessity, but from pure greed and self-
gratification. Each individual in South Africa who values life, liberty and
decency must become a crusader to regenerate the moral fibre of our country
by joining and strengthening the local community police forums and blowing
the whistle when there is corruption, crime and nepotism in any form
whatsoever. Let us all apply ourselves to the sacred task, whether we are
Jews or Christians, Hindus or Muslims, Buddhists or Zoroastrians, agnostics
or atheists. We are all humans. [Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy President and hon members, the post-
1994 democracy for which many South Africans struggled and sacrificed their
lives brought about many challenges, including re-entry to the global
political and economic playing fields. This debate is long overdue and, in
my own humble opinion, should have taken place long before 1999.
[Interjections.] Ideas flowing from this debate could have been used to
inform policies ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, is that a point of order?

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, I have a question for you. Why
do you allow all this rowdiness in the House?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I request you, please, to give a
chance to the speakers to be heard. Proceed, hon Sono.

Mrs B N SONO: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, in my humble opinion, this
debate is long overdue. It should have taken place long before 1999. Ideas
flowing from these debates could have been used to inform policies to
create the basis for focus on marshal plans for the reconstruction and
development of our communities. This debate is about a call for national
consciousness. National consciousness and its spread in this country has to
work against a number of factors. Yes, we agree that when the new
Government took over there were problems already, but, to qualify my first
statement, if this debate had occurred earlier we would have been able to
inform the policies, particularly because we wanted certain expected
outcomes.

First, there are traditional complexities. There was the problem of
poverty, which is still with us. There is the problem of the skewed
education our people got. The problem of crime is still with us.
Globalisation is not new; it has always been there. Then there is the
dislocation of the African historical culture and, lastly, the question of
racism.

In the 1994 elections, the overwhelming majority of blacks voted for
liberation. In 1999, they voted for a better quality of life. They want to
uplift themselves. They prefer to own their own homes and property, to have
employment, education, individual rights, freedom, security of person and
so on.

This national call, if endorsed by all, provides the strategic possibility
of addressing the current socioeconomic and developmental morass. South
Africa should enter into a new phase of dialogue through citizen
empowerment by informing the policies that will best serve its collective
interests.

The most treacherous development after 1994 has been the characterisation
of democracy as a colonialist intervention and imperialist dogma. One would
have expected the ANC-led Government to show a much deeper operational
understanding of their own indigenous political heritage, which brings us
to the question of leadership. [Interjections.]

There has to be moral leadership that is courageous enough to employ
political and intellectual discourse; leadership that can deal with
problems head-on and have insight into dealing with the dislocation of the
African culture. [Interjections.] Fortunately, I knew politics even before
that member got involved. [Interjections.]

Our culture must be defined in concrete terms. We must relate the past to
the present and demonstrate an historical evolution of the modern African.
It is not solely westerners who need to be educated about the indigenous
African political culture. [Interjections.] It is also the new liberators
who are shamefully ignorant of their own political heritage. Unfortunately,
such leadership in South Africa is lacking. [Interjections.]

With regard to racism, it is apparent that we have not succeeded, as a
country, in correctly analysing and developing a strategy that bonds us
together as a nation. Leadership should educate and services the public
interest without pandering to popular whims. Political leaders should be
exemplary in ethical and moral conduct. Unfortunately, politicians in
today's era, by and large, display dishonesty, unreliability and even
eschew morality. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] Churches, synagogues, mosques
and other temples must play a visible role in moral redemption.
[Interjections.]

Teachers are particularly important since they are in daily contact with
the youth, and must become moral guides rather than moral reprobates as
some of them are. Today one reads stories in national publications of
teachers forcing scholars to have sex in classrooms or about teachers
raping students. Schools must also be moral sanctuaries. They must guide
and lead. Importantly, parents are the anchor of morality and guidance to
their children. [Applause.]

Gen C L VILJOEN: Madam Speaker, Deputy President, in the First World War, a
British medical officer researched a similar subject. He asked the
question: What criteria does one use to select, from civilians, the best
material to be trained as military leaders, and to be sure that such
leaders will show courage in war and not collapse under the strain of
battle?

Lord Moran produced a booklet, the Anatomy of Courage, from which I
gathered some wisdom that I find very true; and one guideline that I find
very applicable. He found that the man of character in peacetime is the man
of courage in wartime, for character enables the control of fear.

That is a simple truth that can be applied very much in the same way to
this subject, because character determines conduct. Moral fibre therefore
is directly proportionate to the sum of the qualities of character of all
the individuals in the communities of South Africa. Therefore, to restore
the moral fibre of our society is to rebuild the characters of individuals
and communities.

Hierdie land van ons het nie baie fisieke oorlogskade oorgehou nie. Tog is
die gees en die sedelike karakter van baie mense beskadig. Die talle kere
wat ongeregverdigde metodes gebruik is om 'n regverdigbare doel te bereik
het gewetes doodgeskroei. Die herstel hiervan moet 'n nasionale prioriteit
wees. Dit kom nie vanself nie. Dit moet bestuur word.

Ek noem net 'n paar stappe: die Regering moet die voorbeeld stel deur
volledige eerlikheid in elke opsig, en hulle by akkoorde hou. Tweedens moet
ouers spesiaal aangemoedig word om kinders se integriteit te ontwikkel -
dit is ons toekoms. Derdens is godsdiens en kerkvastheid baie belangrik.
Openbare televisie- en radiodienste se hoë sedelike standaarde moet
gehandhaaf word of hulle moet gedwing word om dit te handhaaf. Elke
gemeenskap moet sy eie gebruike en kultuur ontwikkel en toegelaat word om
so sy eie gewyke en gemeenskapdissipline toe te pas.

Die VF steun hierdie onderwerp en ons sal saamwerk in die bereiking
daarvan. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This country of ours does not have a lot of physical war damage left. Yet
the spirit and moral character of many people have been damaged. The many
instances in which unjustified methods were used to achieve a justifiable
objective deadened people's consciences. The restoring of this must be a
national priority. It will come of its own volition. It must be managed.

I shall mention just a few steps: Government must set the example by being
totally honest in every respect and upholding agreements. Secondly, parents
especially must be encouraged to develop their children's integrity - they
are our future. Thirdly, religion and attachment to the church are very
important. National television and radio services must maintain high moral
standards or they must be forced to maintain them. Every community must
develop its own character and culture and must be allowed to apply its own
practices and community discipline.

The FF supports this subject and we will co-operate to achieve this.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, the moral fibre of South Africa is at its
lowest ebb, and it is not difficult to find where the fault lies. The
country comes from a past fraught with distrust, contempt for authority,
disdain and outright disregard for the basic laws of life.
In striving to restore morality, South Africans have to be tolerant of one
another. They should accept each person as unique and worthy of a place
under the sun. They should see in each person somebody created in the image
of God, worthy of respect and deserving to be treated humanely in a
dignified manner.

The restoration of morality can be enhanced by giving honour to all, doing
to others as we would like them to do unto us. We can restore the moral
fibre by cultivating trust, co-operation and goodwill. As people, we have
to accept that people are unlike rivers that flow in the same direction
depending on the topography of the location. Different opinions have to be
respected.

Some of the evil things that we are stuck with are the aftereffects of the
conduct of the past. Some people were brought up to know that anyone of a
different skin colour should never be trusted, while others grew up
preaching disregard for authority and all institutions that have to do with
authority. Some people rose to high positions by jumping over the corpses
of others.

High-ranking people in Government and administration never cease to boast
about how they brought down past authority through mutiny, eavesdropping
and in some cases blatant refusal to carry out lawful instructions. They
are surprised when the work ethic and productivity are low. All these are
the fruit of what was sowed in the past. Standing up and pontificating on
how public servants are not productive is one thing, but getting them to do
the work for the nation is another. Shakespeare said: ``Talkers are not
good doers.''

Religious institutions, as called upon by the Deputy President this
afternoon, are also calling out like prophets of old. These places of
worship are invariably empty as political leaders feel too important to be
listening to one man or woman speaking from the pulpit without letting
others talk. The church is ready to take all people on board if this has to
do with the enhancement of moral standards. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr K M N GIGABA: Madam Speaker, I should like to thank the Deputy President
for initiating this important debate. It is appropriate that we should, as
society, persistently reflect on some of the tenets that should make up the
basic feature of the democratic society we are creating, because the
Constitution of such a democratic society must be a consequence of the
reconstruction and development of both the material and the spiritual lives
of our people.

Equally important is the need for the generation of the future - the very
custodians of the future - to themselves deliberate on this all-important
question. If we are to succeed in achieving our objectives, we must
confront and change the old mores of society to address the political,
socioeconomic and spiritual morass of that society. In societies driven by
economic exploitation and inequalities, those that have care very little
for the disadvantaged and vulnerable and instead deify selfishness and
greed and put profits before people.

In such societies, moral values such as those to which we aspire, are
elusive. Surely, we will all agree that the mammoth task of regenerating
our moral values requires the creation of a new cadre, a new person and a
new patriot that must epitomise this change. This new person must become a
genuine patriot for the reconstruction and development of the socioeconomic
and spiritual fibre of our society and an antipode of all that apartheid
represented.
Such a person necessarily possesses the moral values consonant with the new
society that is being created. She, because she represents the best and
most noble of values, refuses to condone wrong things, such as those we
mentioned above. This is the morality of caring, the working people and the
rural poor, and the women who are the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in
society. Accordingly, the substance of the moral regeneration of our nation
must be the reconstruction and development programme and the creation of
real equality and justice.

This is a particularly mammoth challenge for the youth of our country who
must now shoulder the responsibility of building and living in this future
better society we are today battling to create. They, more than anyone
else, should do this, because building the future requires that they are
morally and psychologically prepared. It must be their belief that freedom
and a better life constitute the divine destiny of their people. They must
aspire to the best human ideals and values, and their ranks must be the
grinding stone of the best youth in society. We raise this question fully
conscious of the fact that the overwhelming majority of our youth are very
moral.

The national liberation struggle occupied a moral highground among them,
and for its success, they always volunteered to make enormous sacrifices,
believing, as they did, that apartheid was both amoral and immoral. Because
of their leading participation in the front ranks of the struggle, they
were singularly targeted by the apartheid regime, seeking to destroy them
materially and spiritually. A chain of laws and institutions, including
Bantu education, were established to destroy their moral fibre and turn
them into zombies with no intellectual, material and spiritual values to
stand on, except the most perverted.

Accordingly, the moral question in South Africa is not separable from our
past, present and future. The success of the consolidation of the
democratic society depends on this very question of high moral standards
and values. In an era of transition from the old society to the new, young
people must receive special attention, particularly for the reason that
they are the torchbearers of the new society. Everyone must pronounce their
role in moulding great human beings among the ranks of the youth. This
includes parents, teachers, leaders and even the media. Sadly, many are
often found wanting.
Moral renewal does not mean that all youth must be compelled to be
religious. It only means that they must adopt and assimilate ethical values
which are consonant with the ideal of a caring, nonracial, nonsexist,
democratic and united society. Practically, each person must shoulder this
burden of our moral renewal. In this effort, we who are young and who,
together with Parks Makanhlana, fought for the creation of the new society,
swear never to fail our nation. May his soul rest in peace and may his
ideas strike even harder. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, we welcome this debate which hopefully will
help us to reflect on the state of our nation. We share the deep concern
that we have become a nation which is on the slippery slope of moral
decadence.

The basis of a moral society is a moral God. Without this important point
of departure, a nation is like a ship sailing over rough seas without a
compass. Secularism has led to the collapse of our moral system and has
caused us to aspire to be ultramodern and to want to compete with all
societies on things that are not essential, not basic and not a priority,
such as pornography, abortion and the choice of sexual orientation. The
shocking statistics on crime, violence, murder, armed robbery, rape, and
child and woman abuse and molestation confirm, without a doubt, that we are
suffering from a terminal moral disease.

No economy can develop if crime and violence are rampant. No investors will
put their money in such a country. No country in the world has been able to
develop by allowing senseless violence to dominate and by surrendering its
power and freedom to criminals and thugs.

Grinding poverty is haunting us in the midst of obscene wealth, greed and
corruption. There is even a proliferation of superfluous luxuries instead
of the basic needs of the needy. Charles Birch's pithy statement bears
repetition: ``The rich must live more simply that the poor may simply
live.''

We entered the new South Africa on the crest of a wave of freedom.
Unfortunately, that wave has thrust us deeper and deeper into a mania of
freedom. We have, for instance, a culture of rights without
responsibilities. This has created a monstrosity of a nation. We need to
revive an ethic of hard work. In the past, we targeted apartheid and the
apartheid regime. Now we are the Government. We are demonstrating against
ourselves.

We must have a sense of ownership of this country and its Government. We
must develop an ethic of sharing to counter greed and selfishness. We must
share land, wealth and opportunities. If we hoard, there is not enough for
all of us.

The churches and other religious institutions are the conscience of the
nation. The voice of prophecy should be heard again. Otherwise, as a
nation, we will perish. [Time expired.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, vergun my net om ook eers my eie
standpunt te stel. 'n Hoë etiese moraal kan nie van buite afgedwing word
nie. Dit kan nie eens uit die mens self kom nie. Ons weet dit is die werk
van God deur sy Woord in die lewe van mense. Daarom is dit ook vir my van
besondere betekenis dat hierdie debat plaasvind op 31 Oktober,
Hervormingsdag, 2000.

Ons is hier besig met die taak van die staat en ons as openbare
ampsbekleërs. My eerste oproep is dat ons deur voorbeeld en opregtheid en
toewyding die morele standaard in ons land ophef. Kom ons los 'n bietjie in
hierdie Huis die gevry na die massa en wees 'n slag eerlik, en mense sal
weer na ons kan opsien. Die staat is nie die primêre handhawer van sedelike
norme nie, maar hy moet die samelewing so orden dat mense rustig en stil
tot eer van God kan lewe.

In dié verband moet ek sê dat 'n eensydige klem, ook in die Grondwet, op
die regte van die individu sonder inagneming van die verpligtinge van die
individu 'n teelaarde is vir losbandigheid. Verder lê die kern van 'n
gesonde morele peil in die bemagtiging van gemeenskappe en van instellings,
en nie net van individue nie. Sentralisme ontmondig gemeenskappe en
instellings. Vandaar die pleidooi van die AEB vir 'n pluralistiese bestel
waarin gemeenskappe, volke en instellings groter verantwoordelikheid neem
vir hulle lewenspeil. Ek dink die tradisionele leiers is vir ons 'n baie
goeie voorbeeld daarvan, en ook die kerk as gemeenskapinstelling.

Daarom betreur ek die feit dat ons vandag in die pers, en in die besonder
in die Afrikaanse pers, altyd die afwykende teologiese standpunte kry en
dat die sekerheid van mense onder hulle weggeneem word. Verder werk
maatskaplike omstandighede, armoede en morele peil negatief op mekaar in.
Kom ons pak dit aan, kom ons pak die faktore aan wat dit aanmoedig en laat
ons almal saamwerk om nie net lippediens te bewys nie, soos miskien ook
vandag baie in hierdie debat gebeur het, maar om werklik die morele peil
van ons land en mense op te hef. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, allow me first of all to express my own point
of view. High ethical morals cannot be enforced from outside. They cannot
even come from within mankind. We know that this is the work of God through
his Word in the lives of people. Therefore, I also find it extremely
significant that this debate is taking place on 31 October, Reformation
Day, 2000.

We are dealing here with the task of the state and ourselves as public
office-bearers. My first appeal is that we uplift the moral standard of our
country by way of example and honesty and dedication. Let us in this House
for a moment cease courting the masses and be honest for a change, and
people will again be able to look up to us. The state is not the primary
upholder of moral norms, but it must order society in such a way that
people can live peacefully and quietly in honour of God.

In this regard I have to say that a one-sided accentuation, also in the
Constitution, of the rights of the individual, without taking into
consideration the obligations of the individual, is a breeding ground for
licentiousness. Furthermore, the key to a sound moral standard lies in the
empowerment of communities and institutions, and not only individuals.
Centralism disempowers communities and institutions. Hence the plea from
the AEB for a pluralistic dispensation in which communities, peoples and
institutions take greater responsibility for their living standards. I
think the traditional leaders are a very good example of this for us, and
also the church as a community institution.

Therefore, I lament the fact that today in the press, and in the Afrikaans
press in particular, one always has divergent theological points of view
and the certainty of people is thus taken away from them. Furthermore,
social conditions, poverty and moral standards affect one another
negatively. Let us address this, let us address the factors that encourage
this and let us all work together so as not only to pay lip service, as may
have happened frequently in this debate today, but to truly uplift the
moral standard of our country and our people.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, Deputy President and hon
members, it is part of South Africa's good fortune that our President and
Deputy President play a leading role in our quest for morality in our
country. We send our appreciation to them. Our gratitude goes, as well, to
the hon members of this House for their contribution, both directly and
indirectly, to today's debate.

Indeed, the moral trajectory we chart as a nation should be dependent
neither on racial nor on cultural lines, not on ideological nor, yet, on
political beliefs, not on class and, certainly, not on economic positions.
In the words of the famous song by the O'Jays, ``We're all in this thing
together. We've got to work it out. We've got to work it out.''

Such is the gravity, such are the implications, such is the magnitude and
such are the consequences of ethical indifference that our economic
standing, internationally, can be adversely affected. A few weeks ago,
business publications reported on the ranking of nations in terms of
corruption. It is instructive to note the emphasis they placed on the
correlation between domestic and foreign investment in a country and
perceptions, valid or unfounded, of corruption.

It is thus in the interests of all South Africans that we be an honest and
a caring nation and that we become hardworking people, respectful of one
another, and fight crime. There is a time in the history of societies when
the common good has to precede all else. I believe that that time is here
for us in South Africa. I believe that history has presented us, as
leaders, with an opportunity to collectively make a mark on the moral
landscape of our country.

Next year we shall be launching the moral regeneration movement. The launch
is planned to be a national event, bringing together all sectors of our
society in a collective pledge to build moral values and a moral society.
We have already consulted a cross section of South African leaders,
businesspeople, religious organisations, NGOs, CBOs, academics, unions, the
media and other sectors.

The process of consultation continues apace with the Department of
Education, the SABC and the South African Chapter of the African
Renaissance as the co-ordinating committee. The SABC's active involvement
is particularly gratifying, for, as the Deputy President has observed, the
media have no small role in the construction of ethical and moral value
systems.

Our public and private media organisations have a patriotic duty, as do
virtually all individuals and organisations, to promote a social morality
whose ultimate goal is a nation of dignified people. We have produced a
report on moral regeneration. It is a philosophical exposition including,
as it does, the economic aspects of morality. Of course, it is taken for
granted that, in today's world, one cannot really ignore the influences of
globalisation and poverty on people's ethics and behaviour.

A business plan is in its final stages. Resources have to be mustered for
this historic mission, viz the launching of this movement. We ask for hon
members' unstinting support and other forms of encouragement. As individual
political parties, we have to encourage our constituencies to continually
debate and act upon issues of moral regeneration. We shall soon be
presented with an opportunity to sign a moral code of conduct as our own
pledge to morality and good ethics. Let us go on to ask our constituencies
to support the unfolding of the moral regeneration movement by attending
the various youth camps, workshops, debates, seminars and conferences that
will be taking place in order to promote this movement.

The ANC-led Government has a proud tradition of moral and ethical practice.
The most seminal document in the history of South Africa, the Freedom
Charter, is a document that is based very heavily on morality. Its
offshoot, our highly prized Constitution, is universally acclaimed as a
moral legal framework. After our experience of decades of moral bankruptcy
under apartheid, all the parties in this House will attest to the critical
need for a new soul and morality for our nation.

The ANC's Commission for Religious Affairs further demonstrates the
majority party's commitment to the practical infusion of morality into our
social transformation agenda. As it addresses matters of spirituality, it
deals with the crux of morality, namely the development of a mindset and a
consciousness that improves people's conduct.

I would like to address one or two issues that were raised by hon members.
The hon Cassim said that we should not moralise from the top to the bottom.
He is quite right, because certainly we are not moralising. Moralising
implies a better-than-thou attitude, talking down to people on matters of
morality.

However, ours is a call to everybody, every sector in our community, a call
and a challenge to fight the scourge of the degradation of the moral fibre
together. I also agree that any discourse on morality cannot take place in
a vacuum. Material conditions are central to any such discussion.

It was very interesting to listen to the hon Van Schalkwyk who spoke of
statistics on child abuse and so forth. Obviously those statistics have a
role to play, but the danger is that they can be easily manipulated to suit
people's agendas. It is also very important to make sure that the
statistics one uses, have a very sound basis.

I am certainly not going to condone criminal actions, but I want to remind
the hon member that crime in South Africa did not start in 1994. We
inherited a rotten system which, as a matter of fact, is responsible for
the moral decadence that we experience in our country today. That is why we
have decided that, as the ANC-led Government, we are going to take up that
challenge head-on.

That is why we are very transparent, we do not sweep under the carpet evils
that afflict society. The wonderful hon Mr Jankielsohn also spoke very
interestingly about a number of statistics. That is right, but what I find
very interesting is that he gave the impression that morality only has to
do with violent crime.

Yes, violent crimes are certainly immoral but, of course, he did not say
anything about racism, about white-collar crimes, about cheating and
underpaying workers. He did not say anything about bribery, about
selfishness and individualism, he did not say anything about the
manipulation of the media, he did not say anything about pyramid schemes.
Very interesting. [Interjections.]

I was not going to make any reference to the HIV/Aids debate in this
particular instance, but unfortunately I have to respond to what the hon
gentleman said. Hon members will agree with me that it is very easy to be
in the opposition because one has the opportunity and the right to engage
in irresponsible, wild and misleading vote-catching election gimmicks. One
has that opportunity. [Interjections.]

Of course, some of these empty promises to the voters are financially
unsound. [Interjections.] That is why I say that it is very irresponsible
of opposition parties to make such wild promises to people, knowing quite
well that they are not going to be in a position to deliver on those
promises.

I am not going to respond to my good friend the hon Rev Meshoe, because he
was his usual predictable self. I do not think it is worth responding to
what he said, save to say that none of us in this House or outside this
House can arrogate to himself or herself the right to be the tsar on
morality. None of us has the right to do that.

My good friend the hon Mrs Sono was saying nothing but mouthing her
master's pronouncements that are very well known. The hon Gen Viljoen said
something about the importance of rebuilding individual characters. That is
correct. But I would like to go further and say that we also need to
collectively build a society or create an environment in society which
allows zero tolerance of any socially destructive or antisocial behaviour.

Various organs and sectors of society have their own responsibilities, such
as government, for instance. Government has the authority to punish
perpetrators and criminals. Religious institutions and other socialising
institutions such as schools and families have the right to change the
behaviour of people through persuasion, by socialisation, conscientisation,
etc. Parents, unions, businesses and academics, jointly and individually,
also have a very important role to play.

Once again, I would like to thank the hon the Deputy President for having
given us the opportunity to have this debate today. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon members! I notice a
discussion going on across the floor there. I do not know what it is that
is so exciting this afternoon.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: He wants to cross
the floor.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: He wants to cross the floor? I do not know
which member wants to cross the floor. [Interjections.] Order! Order!

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: But we are trying
to prevent it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Minister! I am going to give you
a chance right now with the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk at the podium.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: There is no justice in what the Minister has
said. [Laughter.]

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                               (Introduction)
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, hon members, the Revenue Laws
Amendment Bill represents an important step in our economic transition from
an isolated past to a more global and dynamic future.

This Bill is the second legislative instalment of the tax proposals tabled
in the 2000 Budget. It is one of the steps we are taking to thrive in the
new economic environment. The source-plus basis of taxation is a relic of
the colonial past. The change to a residence-minus system gives our
sovereignty real meaning, and it secures our tax base.

However, like all changes, it has sparked some unhappiness. Partly, this
was because we were up against aggressive avoidance, made possible in the
old system. But partly, too, there were many genuine concerns articulated
by groups in our society.

Before I go any further, allow me to thank all those who have participated
in this wide consultative process - groups which range from the Association
of Black Accountants of SA, the Association of Unit Trusts of SA, Cosatu,
the JSE, the Life Offices' Association of Southern Africa and the SA
Association of Mining Contractors, to name but a few.

Allow me also to sincerely thank the Portfolio Committee on Finance, both
for investing time and work in understanding this Bill and for facilitating
dialogue about it. The fruits of this engagement are, we hope, reflected in
the Bill.

We have adopted legislation which we believe is both pragmatic in terms of
attracting investment, and yet, at the same time, constructs a barrier to
avoidance. The Government's overall policy, as we spelt out again
yesterday, is to broaden our tax base and so allow us the latitude to lower
taxes. We also need, though, to encourage South Africans and international
companies to use South Africa as a base for their operations and expand
globally. We believe that this Bill is consistent with both these
principles.

Allow me to touch on three areas of the new residence base of taxation:
firstly, the reason for changing the system; secondly, some of the factors
taken into consideration in drafting this Bill; and, thirdly, some of the
main features of the new system.

Let me first discuss the reasons for changing. The current source basis of
taxation originates from the time of colonialism and in essence narrows a
country's taxing rights to income that is derived from inside the borders
of the country. But as exchange controls have been relaxed, and as our
citizens and businesses have engaged more with the world, this type of
taxation has become increasingly inadequate.

Why? Firstly, because it does not offer our fiscus sufficient protection
against international transactions whereby profits are diverted from our
local tax base. Secondly, it does not deal effectively with e-commerce
transactions and, thirdly, most of our trading partners have moved to a
residence basis of taxation. Most importantly, moving to a residence basis
widens the tax base, providing room for further tax reductions.

Regarding factors considered in the new Bill, I have spoken about the broad
consultative process we engaged in over this proposed law. It involves
meetings, workshops, interaction on the SARS website and parliamentary
hearings. We believe this legislative package represents a balance of
differing interest in our country, and also keeps in mind the unique
circumstances of South Africa.

Some of the factors we have taken into consideration are the potential
revenue that may flow from the new system; the economic impact of this
transition; South Africa's international competitiveness; SARS's
administrative capacity; and the international legitimacy of the proposed
system.

The legislation we have put on the table is testimony to the earnestness
with which we have considered objections. The proposed law imputes, in
other words, assumes, foreign income in only a limited number of instances.

How will this work? Firstly, the law rests on the definition of a resident.
Who is a resident becomes critical, as residents will be taxed on their
worldwide income. Nonresidents will remain taxable only on their South
African sourced income. Residents will be defined in terms of the well
established international rule of a person who is ``ordinarily resident'',
and a time rule in certain circumstances. In the case of companies,
residency will be determined on the basis of incorporation or effective
management.

The proposed system will have its biggest impact on the taxation of
controlled foreign entities. An entity such as this is a foreign company
controlled by South African residents. In such instances, the Bill provides
that the income of such an entity can be included in the income of the
South Africa residents. However, income will not be imputed if the profits
were generated in a country that taxes income at a rate of at least 27% on
a similar basis to South Africa.

Moreover, even if the income is generated in a relatively low-tax country,
it will only be taxed on its distribution to South Africa in the form of
foreign dividends. But we will tax certain passive income, such as
interest, rental, royalties, etc, as well as income that is diverted away
from South Africa through the system of transfer pricing. We believe that
transfer pricing is possibly one of the most dishonest and manipulative
ways of eluding tax. It is also a less than candid way of treating
customers. One of the main targets of the Bill is precisely such transfer
pricing practices.

Residents who operate businesses abroad in their personal capacity will be
taxed in South Africa, unless their income is earned in a country with
similar taxation to South Africa and at a rate of at least 27%. Income of
South Africans who earn money abroad will also be taxed in South Africa,
but full credit will be allowed for foreign tax paid. However, there are
important exclusions to this rule. We listened carefully to those who were
concerned about the issue of South Africans working abroad on contracts.
This particularly affects construction workers and engineers. They were
concerned that taxing these workers could jeopardise the international
competitiveness of South Africans involved in offshore projects.

To accommodate these concerns, the Bill now proposes that any resident
working outside South Africa for a period exceeding 183 days in total
during a 12-month period will not be subject to tax on that income.
However, residents must also be outside South Africa for a continuous
period of 60 days within that year to qualify for this exemption.

We are mindful that our country needs foreign direct investment. We also
believe that our country offers an attractive base from which to do
business in the region, the continent and the world. For this reason,
international companies who wish to establish their headquaters in South
Africa will be subject to several exemptions. These include not being taxed
on their foreign dividends; not being taxed on income of their Controlled
Foreign Entities; not being subject to secondary tax on dividends that flow
through as a conduit to its foreign shareholders; and not being taxed on
other sources of foreign income. But companies qualifying for these
exemptions must be completely foreign owned and 90% of assets must be held
offshore.

There are other exemptions in the Bill too, specifically for bona fide
projects run by South African companies in, for example, the SADC region
where the host country offers tax incentives. Lastly, the Bill is also
changed to accommodate the increased access to US markets that some of our
exporters will realise in terms of the African Growth and Opportunities
Act.

Taxes are always a source of unhappiness for those on whom they are
imposed. A big change such as the rebasing from source to residence clearly
made some people very unhappy. We hope now that through engagement we have
made more people less unhappy. Happiness itself, though, is not a function
of tax policy.

We have delivered on our promise to cut both corporate and individual
rates. We will continue to deliver on that promise because we believe it is
good for the economy, for our citizens and for our companies.

Chairperson, I hereby introduce the Revenue Laws Amendment Bill and its
attached memorandum. [Applause.]

Bill, together with the introductory speech, referred to the Portfolio
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

          CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE
  AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON DIRECTORATE OF SPECIAL OPERATIONS BILL

Order disposed of without debate.

Report adopted.
                NATIONAL PROSECUTING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF JUSTICE: Chairperson, Deputy President and hon members, by
means of the Bill before this House we are seeking to create the
Directorate of Special Operations, popularly known as the Scorpions.

We are deliberately and purposefully creating a highly skilled, highly
competent and unique unit to complement our existing law-enforcement
agencies, as part of our concerted effort to combat crime and to ensure
that criminals meet with the full force of the law. The prey of these
Scorpions will not be spiders and insects, but rather the plague of
organised criminals and terrorists who have become the scourge of our young
democracy and who, by the very nature of their criminal activities, are
remorselessly undermining and even destroying those fundamental rights
which we have struggled so hard to achieve. The principal objective of the
Scorpions will be to inject into these criminals the venom of criminal law
to attack and paralyse the nervous system of organised crime and terrorism
as effectively and efficiently as possible.
The Directorate of Special Operations will be unique in the sense that it
will form part of the prosecuting authority. It will provide it with the
finely tuned investigative capacity which will focus on prioritised
criminal offences and conduct, with the overriding objective of instituting
appropriate proceedings against the perpetrators involved in such
activities.

The directorate's activities will relate firstly to offences or any
criminal or unlawful activities committed in an organised fashion and,
secondly, to other offences or categories of offences as determined by the
President in his capacity as head of state. The directorate's aims will be
in relation to these matters, to conduct the necessary investigations to
gather, keep and analyse information, and, where appropriate, to institute
criminal proceedings against the perpetrators in question.

The directorate will be headed by a Deputy National Director of Public
Prosecutions, who will perform his or her powers and functions subject to
the control and direction of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.
The head of the directorate will be assisted by the following persons:
investigating directors who are directors of public prosecutions appointed
to the directorate; prosecutors, including deputy directors of public
prosecutions; special investigators, this being a newly created category of
persons to be appointed in terms of the Bill; persons who are seconded to
the directorate; and other persons whose services are obtained by the
directorate.

It is important to note that the Bill makes provision that the existing
investigating directorates of the prosecuting authority, namely the
Directorates for Serious Offences, Organised Crime and Corruption, will,
upon the commencement of this legislation, become part of the Directorate
of Special Operations. The proclamations issued in respect of those
directorates will be deemed to have been issued in respect of the
Directorate of Special Operations.

The Directorate of Special Operations will, therefore, have a clearly
defined mandate right from the word go, so to speak. This mandate will, of
course, be found in the new section 7(1)(a), and the proclamations which I
have just referred to. It is common cause that we are passing this
legislation in order to provide a legal framework for the Directorate of
Special Operations, which was launched in Guguletu in September 1999.

We have had the benefit, in considering this legislation, of being able to
look back at the experience of the functioning of the directorate in just
more than one year. We realise that one cannot, on paper, foresee all the
difficulties that might arise in practice. Neither can we hope to solve all
possible problem areas through legislation. The successful application of
this legislation, and the functioning of the directorate of special
operations will largely depend on those entrusted with the execution
thereof.

The directorate will rely on full partnership with communities, the
national prosecuting authority, the SA Police and the National Intelligence
Agency. The Bill makes provision for the establishment of a ministerial co-
ordinating committee comprising the Ministers responsible for the
administration of justice, who is the chairperson thereof, correctional
services, defence, intelligence services, safety and security and any other
Minister designated by the President from time to time.

The principle function of the committee is to co-ordinate the activities of
the Directorate of Special Operations and those of other government
institutions involved in the investigation of crime. It will be the task of
this committee to determine policy guidelines in respect of the functioning
of the Directorate of Special Operations, to determine procedures to co-
ordinate the activities of the directorate and other relevant government
institutions, and to determine, when necessary, the responsibility of the
directorate in respect of specific matters and the further procedures to be
followed for the referral or assigning of any investigation to the
directorate.

The successful operation of the directorate will largely depend on the
levels of skills, commitment and competence of the special investigators.
Two factors are essential in order to ensure that we achieve the necessary
degree of excellence in this regard. Firstly, the strictest recruitment and
vetting procedures must be used to ensure that we recruit special
investigators of a high calibre, persons with flawless integrity who are
capable of performing their functions without fear or favour.

Candidates for appointment will be properly vetted in order to establish
their proficiency and competence for the functions they will carry out,
their commitment to the Constitution of the Republic and loyalty to the
Republic, their foreign travels and contacts, drug use, financial
obligations, hobbies and other related issues. It will, furthermore,
include intensive interviews, psychometric tests, medical tests and
polygraph tests.

The Bill also makes provision in the proposed new section 19B for repeated
security screening of special investigators, and if a security clearance
certificate of a special investigator is withdrawn, he or she must be
discharged from office. There is no discretion involved.

The second factor entails that we must ensure that persons with the proper
public personal profiles aspire to appointment as special investigators.
Furthermore, once we have succeeded in appointing the best of the best,
once we have established this core of highly skilled and competent special
investigators, we must ensure that we retain their services. We must ensure
that their remuneration packages are commensurate with the degree of
skills, competence and commitment required of them, and that their other
conditions of service are conducive to a sound labour environment.

At the same time, it is important for the administration to ensure that the
disparity between the packages of members of the SA Police and the
Scorpions does not become or remain so large that it saps the morale of the
members of the one law enforcement agency and undermines the very purpose
of the establishment of the Scorpions. The President of the Republic, in
his speech in this House, on 25 June 1999, indeed did say that the
conditions of service of police officials should be reviewed and improved.
This process has yet to be completed.

I believe that I cannot overemphasise the importance of the common
denominator which is central to the directorate of special operations and
all other institutions which may contribute, in one way or another, to its
successful functioning, namely the combating of the crimes falling within
the range of matters in respect of which we are creating the directorate.
This is underscored by the fact that this legislation, I believe, carries
the support of all parties in this House.

I am particularly appreciative of the hard work which the Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development has put into this
legislation. Given the amount of publicity, both positive and negative,
which the directorate has elicited prior to and even subsequent to the
introduction of this Bill, and the importance of the subject matter in
question, the committee was confronted with a daunting task in considering
this legislation.

The committee also carefully considered the issue of constitutionality that
was raised on some aspects of the Bill and obtained a legal opinion from
the Chief State Law Advisor in which he expressed the view that the Bill is
constitutionally sound. In my view, the committee has produced a balanced
piece of legislation which carefully addresses all possible areas of
concern. The committee deserves to be commended for its work in this
regard.

I have been assured by the National Director of Public Prosecutions that
the vision of the directorate is to be a world class unit that is loved by
the people, feared by criminals and respected by its peers. In this regard,
particularly, I lend them my total and unstinting support. [Applause.]
Adv J H DE LANGE: Mr Chairperson, Deputy President, hon members, ladies and
gentlemen, I rise on behalf of the ANC in unconditional support of these
amendments to the National Prosecuting Authority Act, a Bill which
commenced its life in Parliament as the Directorate of Special Operations
Bill.

I am particularly happy to stand here today and say to members that this
Bill has been passed with the unanimous support of all the parties that
participated in the committee. I think it is a very important aspect that
we were able, as a Parliament, to sit down, work out where the differences
are and agree on a piece of legislation which is very important in our
fight against crime.

It is very important that we do not politicise the issue of, particularly,
crime in this country and that we can send out one clear message to the
criminals in this country that we will keep on chasing them, keep on
hunting them down, not haunting them - if we can haunt them, that will be
good, but if we can hunt them down, that will also be good - and get rid of
them as soon as we possibly can in this country.

I particularly think it is important that we mentioned the milestone for
the Department of Justice. It is important to realise, when we pass these
two Bills, that it is the 75th piece of legislation the Department of
Justice is passing through Parliament since 1994, 75 pieces of legislation
that the department has brought here. Those metrics of legislative
enactment that formed the 75 pieces of legislation have irreversibly
transformed our Department of Justice.

There are still hiccups - there are still problems with implementation,
with funding and all those matters - but that should never detract from the
immense amount of work that both our Ministers, who have headed that
department, namely, Minister Maduna and Minister Omar, have put in to
transform what was one of the cornerstones of apartheid in this country.
Many South Africans, particularly black South Africans, felt the sharp end
of the apartheid stick through the Department of Justice, and I think that
has changed forever and irreversibly and we owe a debt of gratitude
particularly to our two Ministers that oversaw this process.

Let me also start with a few `thank yous' for the people who have actually
put this legislation, the Scorpions legislation, before Parliament.
Firstly, we have to thank the interministerial committee. I think we speak
on behalf of everyone whom we say that they established the Scorpions
structure, they have overseen it in its infancy and guided it and have
actually drafted legislation to formalise that structure in Parliament.
This structure, as members know, has been headed by our President who has
been actively involved, and our two Ministers, Tshwete and Maduna, have
been in the forefront of being the midwives of this institution in our
country. I think we owe all of them a debt of gratitude. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Midwives, Johnny?

Adv J H DE LANGE: Midwives, Minister.

Secondly, I want to thank the various departments that have been involved -
Safety and Security, Intelligence, as well as the Department of Justice,
and in particular the prosecuting authority that is headed by Mr Bulelani
Ngcuka. I want to particularly recognise him - I see he is in the House
today.
As hon members know, I think that the prosecuting authority, since we
established it a year or two ago, has become one of the real success
stories in the country, particularly under the able leadership of Mr
Ngcuka. It is very important that we have placed the Scorpions, which is
the structure with which we hope to really fight the most prioritised
national crimes in our country, under his able guidance. I wish him well
and I want to congratulate him and his staff on what they have achieved so
far.

I also want to thank the Department of Justice, particularly Adv Johan de
Lange, who has worked tirelessly to make sure that we have this piece of
legislation. That De Lange is the intelligent one. I see all hon members
are smiling. I am not congratulating myself.

Lastly, I also want to thank the two justice committees, particularly my
counterpart in the other House, Mr Jabu Mahlangu. We dealt with this Bill
jointly, and they have contributed as much as our committee has and we want
to thank them for that.

As I have said, I really want to thank the leaders of the opposition
parties in both committees. There were some elements in the media who were
very positive towards this legislation, but some of them, for example as
shown in one of the Pretoria News editorials, were very antagonistic
towards this legislation. From the outset I was very worried that this
issue would become politicised, but I can assure this House that not one of
the political parties in the committees tried to make a political football
out of this. We sat and looked at this carefully and as mature people, and
we were able to reach consensus. I really want to thank the leaders of the
opposition parties for the way they have conducted themselves in this
matter.

Just a little bit about the history of the Bill. As hon members recall,
this legislation has gone an unusual route in the sense that we have
created the institution administratively first, and we are now formalising
it through legislation. This flowed from a need expressed by our President
in his first speech in Parliament when he was appointed, in which he
indicated that a decision had been taken to create a specialised unit, and
that this specialised unit would concentrate particularly on national
priority crimes. Thereafter, administratively, with the staff and resources
of the three departments I have mentioned, the Scorpions got off the ground
and I think they have achieved some very important successes.

They then drafted the legislation and the legislation that reached us
created a stand-alone institution separate from those three departments I
mentioned. We were worried about this as a committee, across party lines.
We were worried that it created certain artificialities, that it was
difficult to understand with regard to the lines of accountability and
where the control and supervision would be within this structure of the
Scorpions. We sat down and called in the three departments and after
hearing them thoroughly, after a whole day of debate and inputs, we then
sat down as a committee and worked out that the best way to deal with this
was not to do it as a stand-alone structure, but actually to establish the
Scorpions within one of the structures that already existed in terms of the
Constitution.

Because the Scorpions has been created on a troika principle, that is, that
it should consist of intelligence capacity, investigative capacity and
prosecuting capacity, with the prosecuting authority driving that process,
it was very obvious to us that what needed to be done was that this
Directorate of Special Operations had to be established within the
prosecuting authority. Once we had taken that decision and spoken to the
Minister and they were happy to do that, many of the problems of control,
supervision and accountability fell away, because all those aspects are
very clearly spelt out in the Constitution - that the Minister of Justice
has the final responsibility for the prosecuting authority and that the
National Director is in charge.

In the previous Bill we passed on the National Prosecuting Authority the
lines of control were clearly drawn. All we had to do was create an
investigating capacity within the national prosecuting authority. Once we
had done that, and once we had provided for a separate budget for the
Scorpions, driven by an accounting officer within the Scorpions, many of
the problems that we had and many of the complaints that we heard,
particularly through the media, seemed to fall away.

It was actually amazing that, after the first week of dealing with the
legislation, there were no further adverse comments in the media about this
matter. I hope now that we have passed the Bill, and unanimously, there are
going to be some positive comments in the media. That, of course, is
wishful thinking sometimes. Let us just hope that that will happen.

I am not going to deal with the different aspects of the Bill. I think the
Minister has dealt with that and I should, at least, leave something for
the other members to deal with. I do want to mention that some issues of
constitutionality were raised. We looked at the issue of constitutionality
very carefully and, as the Minister pointed out, we received opinions in
this regard.

We are clearly of the view that nowhere in our Constitution does it state
that the investigating powers that have to be exercised in this country
should be the exclusive preserve of the policing authority. In fact, if
that were the case, many pieces of legislation in this country would be
unconstitutional. The TRC has its own investigating capacity, the Public
Protector has its own investigating capacity, the so-called Heath
Commission has its own investigating capacity, Customs has its own
capacity, and Environmental Affairs has its own investigating capacity.

Clearly, at no stage did we ever intend to pass a Constitution that gave
that capacity solely to the policing authority of this country. We found
nothing in the Constitution that would suggest that to be so. In fact, to
tell the truth, no one came and seriously gave us such an opinion, either
in the committee or in writing.

Secondly, there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits us from
giving a limited investigating capacity, in very specialised areas of crime
fighting, to the prosecuting authority. So, in respect of both those
principles, we have found no prohibition in our Constitution which does not
allow us to give the prosecuting authority the kind of powers that we have
given it in this regard.

It seems to me that the next phase now is probably the most important one,
and that is implementation. It is now left to the Minister, and
particularly to Mr Ngcuka in the prosecuting authority, to try to get the
structure off the ground, in line with this legislation, as quickly as they
possibly can.

I want to point out - I think I am doing this on behalf of all parties -
that sometimes there is a big misunderstanding in the psyche of our nation
that crimes somehow just resolve themselves. In other words, one just puts
people in prison and that is the end of the story. That is how one fights
crime.

In any civilised society, one can only convict people on credible evidence.
Evidence is not something that one can write on a piece of paper or suck
from one's thumb. Evidence is something that people have to provide to our
police force.

It is very important for us to get the message across to our people that we
can only really fight crime, and the Scorpions can only really be
successful, if ordinary people in South Africa stand up and turn their
backs on crime, because the authorities in this country can only fight
crime if there is credible evidence on which they can, firstly, arrest
people; secondly, refuse them bail, and, thirdly, convict them. Only then
does the issue of sentencing come in, once we have a conviction. All that
can only happen based on credible evidence.

Now that we have the Scorpions, we want to call on the public and tell them
that they can show trust in this structure. The Minister has shown how we
are creating special screening mechanisms so that the wrong people do not
get into that structure. We call on the people of South Africa to bring
evidence forward, particularly on organised crime, so that we can put these
criminals away once and for all, and live that better life that we want to
live. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson, I rise, on behalf of the DP and the DA, to
support this Bill. I hope the fact that the opposition supports the Bill
will not cause concern in the ranks of the majority party, so that they
doubt their own judgment in introducing it. We do support the Bill and want
to work with the Government in this respect.

I also wish to address the broader context which made it a necessity to
have this Bill. But, first of all, I want to add the name of the
chairperson, Mr Johnny de Lange, to the list of people who should be
thanked. He has omitted his own name from the list, and yet he played an
extraordinarily important role in the formulation of what we have before us
today. As he pointed out in the portfolio committee, this is a stand-alone
Bill. He was the first one to point out a number of unacceptable features.
He was the one who came up with the idea of fitting it into the existing
legislation, as we are doing today.

The Directorate of Special Operations is a very special tool that has been
given to South Africa. They are an elite organisation called the Scorpions.
I want to wish them well today. But I want to call upon them to earn the
name ``Scorpions''. They have to be true to their name. Secondly, they must
earn the reputation of being scrupulously fair, disciplined, diligent and
efficient. One cannot be made great, one has to achieve greatness.

I think that this is a first in Africa, in South Africa and maybe in the
world, to a certain extent. They have a very special task. Earlier on in
the deliberations we agreed that the first task and the main objective
would be to fight organised crime, and between the chairperson and myself
we agreed that there is a fine line: If one kicked one's dog, that may be a
crime, but if one kicked all of one's dogs, that may be an organised crime.
[Laughter.]

I also want to call on the Ministers involved to use the Scorpions with
discretion, to earn that trust of the public. I want to call on the public
to give the Scorpions a fair chance to prove their value and their worth,
as well as to support them by coming forward with the necessary evidence.
The Scorpions will have to be managed carefully, and should not cause
friction between themselves and the SA Police Service, or create an aura of
arrogance that they are the better people. They need to work with the
police. After all, my number one hero is still the bobby on the beat who
has never claimed to be a hero, but day after day does his duty.

I want to point out one aspect of an existing section that we have not
dealt with. Section 28(8) says that in the interrogation, a person
investigated -


  ... shall not be entitled to refuse to answer any question upon the
  ground that the answer would tend to expose him or her to a criminal
  charge.

This will have to be judicially managed by the unit. I have no doubt that
the rule against self-incrimination is so strong that, despite this,
whatever a person says in such an interrogation could not be validly
tendered as evidence against such a person in court.

Ek wil graag iets meer sê oor die wye konteks. Ons gaan deur 'n moeilike
tyd ten opsigte van misdaad. Ons het onlangs by die regscolloquium gehoor
dat minder as 10% - ek dink dit is 8% - van alle klagtes wat ingedien word
uiteindelik in 'n skuldigbevinding eindig. Dit is te laag! As ons in
hierdie land net 8% van alle misdade uiteindelik op die punt bring waar die
misdadiger aan die man gebring word, stuur ons af op 'n ramp. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I would like to say something about the broader context. We are going
through a difficult time with regard to crime. We recently heard at the law
colloquium that less than 10% - I think it is 8% - of all charges laid
eventually end in a conviction. This is too low! If we in this country only
bring 8% of all crimes to a point where the offender is brought to book, we
are heading for a disaster.]

May I refer to what is said in the recent edition of the Nedbank Crime
Index. During 1999 the levels of reported crime increased at a faster rate
than in any other year since 1994. Violent crime increased by almost 10%
between 1998 and 1999 - more than any other crime category. During 1999
every third crime reported to the police involved violence or the threat of
violence. The question is: Is South Africa losing the battle against
violent crime? According to the survey, between 1994 and 1999, violent
crime increased by 21,6%.

Dan verwys ek na Die Burger van vandag wat sê nagenoeg 900 Suid-Afrikaanse
boere het nou reeds sedert die politieke transformasie in 1994 in
plaasaanvalle landwyd gesterf. Negehonderd in meer as tweeduisend aanvalle!
Dit beteken dat 274 boere per elke 100 000 jaarliks koelbloedig vermoor
word. Tweehonderd vier-en-sewentig per 100 000, en weet agb lede wie kom
tweede? Dit is net so ontstellend.

Wetstoepassers word vermoor teen 'n jaarlikse koers van 153 per 100 000.
Vir elke 100 000 wetstoepassers in Suid-Afrika word 153 per jaar vermoor.

Vergelyk dit nou met die wêreldgemiddeld, waarvolgens 5 uit elke 100 000
mense vermoor word per jaar. In die VSA is dit 6 uit elke 100 000. Hier
praat ons van 274 boere per 100 000 per jaar en 153 wetstoepassers per 100
000. Dit is te hoog.

Ek wil die Minister die onderneming gee dat hy op die volle samewerking van
die hele Huis kan reken as ons nou as 'n tweede stap nadat ons nou hierdie
eerste stap doen, het met 'n daadwerklike plan teen geweldsmisdade kom. Ons
kan nie toelaat dat 'n boerebevolking - boere met 'n kleinletter,
``farmers''- koelbloedig uitgeroei word in Suid-Afrika.

Ek het pas weer die inligting gekry van 'n boer wat vermoor is. Volgens
mediese getuienis is hy ses uur lank gemartel. Al sy vinger- en toonnaels
is uitgetrek met warm tange. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is dinge wat skokkend
is! Dit is dinge wat roep om die Minister se aandag. Dit is sake waarin ons
die Minister wil help om werklik met 'n plan te kom teen alle vorms van
geweld, en ek noem voorbeelde wat blykbaar nie oral gewild is nie. Ek kan
ander voorbeelde ook noem. Ons kan soveel gevalle van gewelddadige, wrede
verkragting opnoem. Is ons dan werklik die geweldshoofstad van die wêreld?
Ek wil pleit by die Minister. Ons het 'n eerste belangrike stap gedoen.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would now like to refer to Die Burger of yesterday which says that
approximately 900 South African farmers have already died in farm attacks
countrywide since the political transformation in 1994. Nine hundred in
more than 2 000 attacks! This means that 274 farmers per 100 000 are
murdered in cold blood annually. Two hundred and seventy-four per 100 000,
and do hon members know who comes second? That is just as upsetting. Law-
enforcement officers are murdered at an annual rate of 153 per 100 000. For
each 100 000 law-enforcement officers in South Africa, 153 are murdered
annually.

Now compare that with the world average, in terms of which 5 out of every
100 000 people are murdered annually. In the USA it is 6 out of every 100
000. Here we are talking about 274 farmers per 100 000 annually and 153 law-
enforcement officers per 100 000. That is too high.

I want to give the Minister the undertaking that he can count on the full
co-operation of the entire House if, as a second step after we have taken
this first step, we produce a decisive plan against violent crimes. We
cannot allow a farming population to be cold-bloodedly eradicated in South
Africa.
I recently again received information about a farmer who was murdered.
According to medical evidence he was tortured for six hours. All his
fingernails and toenails were pulled out with hot pliers. [Interjections.]
These are things which are shocking! These are things which cry out for the
Minister's attention. These are issues with which we want to assist the
Minister in truly producing a plan against all forms of violence, and I am
mentioning examples which are apparently not popular everywhere. I could
also mention other examples. We could mention so many instances of violent,
cruel rape. Are we then truly the violence capital of the world? I want to
appeal to the Minister. We have taken an important first step.]

We have given the hon the Minister the tools to fight organised crime and
what we call ``white-collar crime''. Let us now come with a plan that will
work, a plan to fight violence in South Africa. We promise the Minister our
support. [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, Ministers, hon members, the Bill before us today
comes at a time when South Africa is faced with a plague of violence and
crime. Criminals are becoming more and more sophisticated and leave no
stone unturned to reach their nefarious goals. Our normal police force
agencies have perhaps reached the limits of their capacity to combat crime,
lawlessness and corruption - a monster that needs to be rooted out by
force. Now is the time for the Scorpions to act.

I think any government would welcome any elite force such as the Scorpions
to combat crime. Such a force will have a unique style and method of
operation as it is not a law enforcement agency that is identical to the SA
Police Service. It will operate in terms of the legislation that we are
debating here today and will fall under the jurisdiction of the national
prosecuting authority.

Another factor that should be taken into account is that the Scorpions will
have guidelines setting out the scope of their work. They will investigate
cases stipulated in their work guidelines, so as not to clash with the
functions of existing bodies such as the SA Police. Whether it will work in
practice remains to be seen.

In general, the IFP supports the idea of an elite force in the crucial
fight against all forms of crime, particularly sophisticated syndicate
crimes. However, we should not lose sight of the practical problems that
have resulted and will, in future, result from the creation of the
Directorate of Special Operations, the so-called Scorpions.

These problems are related to the fragmentation of law enforcement agencies
in South Africa, jurisdictional uncertainty and conflict between the SAPS
and other law enforcement agencies, such as the Scorpions, and duplication
of effort in a situation where we have scarce resources. It is, therefore,
vital that the interministerial co-ordinating committee, consisting of the
Ministers of Justice, Correctional Services, Defence, Intelligence and
Safety and Security, plays the role envisaged for it in the Bill, in other
words, co-ordinating the activities of the Scorpions and other law
enforcement agencies. Without a strong oversight and co-ordinating role
being played by this committee, it is almost certain that the fight against
crime will become mild, and jurisdictional clashes, professional jealousy
and operational inertia will only benefit the criminals.

The IFP welcomes the fact that the Scorpions will not be allowed to embark
on industrial action, in other words, strikes. To the best of my knowledge,
the criminals do not belong to a trade union and, therefore, do not go on
strike. There is one factor, however, that I wish to bring to the hon the
Minister's attention in this regard: The notion of strike action has been
endorsed, but what about the notion of a go-slow? Surely this form of
protest will not be tolerated? The IFP will vote in favour of this Bill.

Okumele kube mqoka kuNgqongqoshe ngukuthi amacala enkohlakalo ngamacala
afuna izincelebana eziyizinhlabamkhosi ngokwenzekayo ezweni sakhile.
Inkinga-ke ngukuthi, kulezo zinhlabamkhosi, kuyothiwani uma kutholakala
ukuthi kuyenzeka inhlabamkhosi iyinye isetshenziswe ngabaseshi bama-CID,
ibe futhi isetshenziswa ngama-Scorpions? Lokho kusho ukuthi kuyoba khona
ukungqubuzana okungadala ukukhwabanisa nokulahlwa komkhondo wokuphenya
icala. Kungenzeka futhi ukuthi icala ebelilandelwa ngama-CID kubonakale
ukuthi liyicala lama-Scorpions. Ngabe kuyokwenzeka yini ukuthi lumiswe
uphenyo ukuze lelo cala lidluliselwe kuma-Scorpions na?

Okunye engifuna ukukhuluma ngakho yimivuzo ezonikezwa ama-Scorpions.
Ngokubona kwami kuyothi lapho sekuqansa khona, amaphoyisa e-SAPS, athi:
Sebenzani nina ma-Scorpions ngoba phela uHulumeni unibonelele kangcono
ngokuthi aninikeze nina kuphela imivuzo efeza izidingo kangcono. Kodwa
thina, abayizingqalabutho ezingamaphoyisa akudala, akazange asibonelele
ngemivuzo engase ibe ngcono, okuyinto ebeyingasenza nathi sikhuthale.

Lokho kungase kusidalele inkinga. Ngibhekisa kuNgqongqoshe wezokuPhepha
nokuVikeleka ukuthi akubhekisise lokho ngoba kuyomdalela inkinga. Phela
amaphoyisa azobona ukuthi laba abanye ngabangcono kunawo, bese ethi ngakho-
ke kuyofuneka kusebenze bona kuphela. Ngithi-ke kuNgqongqoshe naye
makabhukule aphakamise. Amaphoyisa akhe kudingeka athi ukuwaphonse-phonsela
uhlamvana ukuze sikhande isimo sokuthi kungabi ngama-Scorpions kuphela
angcono futhi azokhokhelwa iholo elingcono. Kufuneka kubonakale ukuthi nawo
amaphoyisa siyawacabangela ukuze akwazi ukusebenza ngendlela yokuthi afike
kuleliya zinga lama-Scorpions ukuze kube khona ukuncintisana. (Translation
of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[What should be important to the hon the Minister is that criminal cases
require spies who will reveal things that are happening in the country. The
problem is, what will be done in a situation where one spy has been working
for the CID and the Scorpions simultaneously. This means that there will be
trouble. That trouble will cause misappropriation and the lose of the
case's track. It can happen that a case that is being investigated by the
CID is a case against the Scorpions. Will it be possible to stop that
investigation so as to transfer it to the Scorpions?

Another issue that I want to raise is that of rewards which will be given
to the Scorpions. As far as I am concerned, when things get tough, the SAPS
will say: ``You, the Scorpions, work because the Government provides you
with things that enable you to be more efficient. We, the old police force,
have never been provided with better things that will motivate us.''

This might cause us problems. I am directing my speech to the hon the
Minister of Safety and Security to look at this issue seriously because it
might cause him trouble. The SAPS will think that the Scorpions are better
than them. They will say the Scorpions are the only ones who must work. I
would like to warn the hon the Minister that he must be aware of this. He
must give the SAPS a salary increase so as to avoid a situation where only
the Scorpions are given better salaries and attention. We must show that we
also take the SAPS seriously. This will encourage them to perform at the
same level as the Scorpions so that they will compete with them.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, the Scorpions will have been operating free
of any specific legislative framework or constraint for almost 18 months by
the time Parliament passes this Bill - clearly not an ideal situation from
the point of view of Parliament's important oversight role in relation to
holding the executive and its initiatives accountable.

The Scorpions are the brainchild of President Mbeki. He announced the
establishment of this new group of supercops in July 1999. The idea of
creating a group of supercops, who would operate in close conjunction with
the country's prosecuting authority to target and tackle particular
categories of high-profile crime and criminals, especially organised crime
and crime syndicates, is a good one. However, the questions of where to
situate such an elite group of cops, their reporting lines, authorities,
liaison with other police units, ministerial responsibility and so on were
never going to be easy.

The way these questions were tackled in the first Bill approved by Cabinet
and tabled in Parliament earlier this year was downright problematic. The
first Bill raised many questions, not the least of which was related to its
constitutionality. In addition, the structure the executive proposed to us
in the committee was thoroughly confused and top-heavy with several
Ministers given a finger in the pie.

We, in the New NP and the DA, believe that the reworked concept, as
included in this redrafted Bill before us today, has largely eliminated
these problems, and we support the Bill. Much credit for this vast
improvement to, not only the concept, but also the structure, must be given
to the chairperson of the Justice portfolio committee, the hon Johnny de
Lange, who, it must be said, was fully supported in his initiative by
members of the committee, regardless of their political affiliation, and,
of course, ably assisted by the department.

I believe that the goal for all of us was to achieve the best possible
legal structure for the Scorpions, because I believe we would all like this
presidential initiative to succeed. There is no doubt that an effective
crimebusting capacity is desperately needed in our criminal justice system.
The latest statistics give a totally gloomy picture of the growth in
serious and violent crime since the democratic Government took over in
1994, and the failure of that Government to successfully combat crime and
secure convictions for criminal acts.

The latest Government official to put the naked truth about crime in South
Africa today on the table, apparently ignoring the officially decreed
blackout, was no less a figure than the Scorpions' supreme boss and head of
the national prosecuting authority, Adv Bulelani Ncguka, at the justice
colloquium less than two weeks ago, when he pointed out that reported
serious crime has increased by no less than 37% since 1994. The number of
cases going to court has increased by 8%, but, while just over 29% of
criminal cases were closed as undetected in 1994, five years later, in July
1999, when the President announced the formation of the Scorpions, a
whopping 48,2% had been closed as undetected.

During that period, the number of cases withdrawn increased by 32% and the
offender population in our country increased by 47%. One does not have to
be a rocket scientist to deduce from these figures that something is
terribly wrong with the way this Government administers the criminal
justice system or attempts to combat crime or bring offenders to justice.

Adv Ngcuka's figures have been reconfirmed, as was pointed out by my
colleague in the DA, as recently as this week, by independent data,
according to the Nedcor Institute for Security Studies index. The number of
reported violent crimes was greater last year than in any other year since
1994. In 1994, 30% of all reported crimes were violent and last year this
figure was up by 32%, the worst figure ever. A particular phenomenon which
my colleague highlighted, was the high and growing incidence of violent
crime on farms. He pointed out that there had been over 2 000 attacks on
farms during which nearly 400 people had been murdered between the
beginning of 1997 and the end of 1999.

These figures are testimony to failure and there is cold comfort in the
projected amounts to be spend on criminal justice in terms of the Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework presented to Parliament yesterday by the hon the
Minister of Finance, Mr Trevor Manuel. An increase of R5,2 billion over the
three-year period represents a year-on-year increase, apparently, of only
6,6%, barely keeping up with inflation. In other words, it seems there will
be little or no extra money for the criminal justice system.

All parties in Parliament welcome any attempt by Government to tackle the
problem of crime. The Scorpions is surely not the whole answer, but it is
clearly an attempt by Government to do something about the problem.
According to the hon Minister Manuel, the Scorpions will get increased
funding in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The main target of the
Scorpions is organised crime, but in terms of the Bill before this House
the President may, by proclamation, determine that a particular category of
crime should be investigated by the Scorpions. Perhaps farm attacks and
murders should be a case in point.

Prior to this legislation being passed, the various components of the
Scorpions functioned under seven pieces of legislation. The new Bill places
the directorate squarely under the National Prosecuting Authority and this
Bill, as has been said, is an amendment to the National Prosecuting
Authority Act.

The Minister of Justice is the responsible Minister and the President is no
longer directly involved. The relationship with other criminal justice
departments, and particularly the SAPS, is catered for through a
ministerial co-ordinating committee which may determine policy guidelines
in respect of the functioning of the Scorpions.

The secret of a successful formula for the Scorpions is the close co-
operation between the police and the prosecutors; hence the need to situate
the elite police unit within the NPA and under its control. This has been
tried with good results in other investigating directorates. There is
therefore no reason why it should not work here.

However, the birth of the unit has not been unproblematic. Problems include
the fact that, although the new recruits are better educated than normal
SAPS officers because tertiary education is a must, they are mostly young
and inexperienced. The point that they get twice the pay of an equivalent
SAPS officer is also a problem. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, there are some
members in the House who are showing their backs to the speaker.

I think that while it is permissible for members to converse with those
seated next to them, it could not be appropriate, in Parliament, for
members to be conferencing over their shoulders. If hon members therefore
would like to have the support of the Chair for continuing their
conversation, let it be done seated next to each other.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, hon members, the passage
of this Bill into an Act of Parliament gives legal backing to the existence
of the Scorpions as a national specialist unit against organised crime.

As we all know, it was the hon President himself who last year announced in
this House that, in order to reinforce conventional policing, which remains
the primary responsibility of the South African Police Service, we also
needed an agency which would focus on certain specific crime types. That
vision remains in force to this day, as an expression of the Government's
commitment to bringing down the levels of crime in our country. The
resources that have been availed to the Scorpions and the SA Police
Service, by both the Government and our friends abroad, clearly indicate to
all and sundry our firm resolve to deliver the safety and security which is
the birthright of all South Africans.

With the Scorpions coming of age, the SA Police Service can only grow
stronger. Already, the marked improvement in the quality of investigation
and prosecution of crime confirms the fact that in an environment that is
properly managed, the coexistence of the SA Police Service and the
Scorpions can be mutually reinforcing.

It is, of course, common knowledge that sharp contradictions developed
between the SA Police Service and Idoc, the Investigative Directorate on
Organised Crime, here in the Western Cape, especially in Cape Town, around
the ownership of dockets and leadership of various investigations. But the
Minister of Justice and I were, and still are, ready to intervene and push
professional jealousy to the periphery. We are succeeding, and very happy
to indicate to the House that the desired co-operation between the SA
Police Service and the Scorpions is, indeed, in place.

We hope that the passage of this Bill will help consolidate the idea in the
minds of both the SA Police Service and Scorpions investigators that at
stake is not just their individual glory, but the salvation of this country
and its citizens. I speak with a great deal of conviction when I say that
the SA Police Service and the Scorpions will not let us down.

Another issue of tension that has surfaced recently is the salary
discrepancies between the two. I am not bothered by the way the print media
handled this very sensitive matter. They reserve the right to keep the
public informed about a whole range of topics, including those that might
compromise the integrity and morale of the state's security organs. What
concerns me most profoundly are the utterances of some politicians who
pronounced on this issue with both eyes focused on the forthcoming
elections.

We have always argued, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development and I, that the fight against crime is not the exclusive
responsibility of the SA Police Service and the Scorpions, and that every
one of us in this House and outside this House has the responsibility to
define for and arrogate to themselves responsibilities in the area of
strengthening the hand of both the Scorpions and the SA Police Service.
Without the active mobilisation of the greatest number of our people in the
fight against crime, there is absolutely no way that we can get to where we
want to be pretty soon.

It is on that score that I would, once again, urge hon members not to see
the fight against crime as something to politick about, something to score
cheap political points on, but rather to see it as a collective
responsibility demanding a collective response from all of us. We need to
take the water and leave the fish to drown in a dry pond, and that is when
we begin to do this extensive work in our own respective constituencies.

I would like to say to the hon member Mzizi that the Government is doing
its level best to raise the profile of the SA Police Service so that it
becomes the pride of the nation and not the Cinderella profession that it
had been reduced to in the past. Right now, and over and above what has
been agreed to in the bargaining chamber, the Cabinet has by resolution
recommended a special dispensation around the service conditions of members
of the SA Police Service. When the nitty-gritty has been finalised, we
shall have been able to further improve the salary packages of the SA
Police Service members. We hope that by so doing we shall have travelled
quite a long distance in addressing the issue of the discrepancies that
have been pointed out.

I am also happy that the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development has just indicated in this House today that the department
which he leads is also taking the matter of closing this gap as seriously,
so that there is no situation that develops in which members of the SA
Police Service are drawn this way or that way because of these
discrepancies in terms of salary packages. It is the responsibility of the
two of us, as a matter of fact, to carry the Cabinet with us towards the
fulfilment of that resolution that sought to address the issue of salary
discrepancies. In the meantime, let us not fan the fires. Elections come
and go, but policing will remain with us at all material times. [Applause.]

This Bill appeals in a special sense for the closure of ranks between the
SA Police Service and the Scorpions. On both sides we are blessed with good
officers, and a good officer is one with an abundance of patience. Let us
give this Bill a chance. The Department of Safety and Security supports its
passage. [Applause.]

Mr M E MABETA: Chairperson, hon members, the UDM fully supports this Bill.
This Bill is important to us because, for the first time, the mandate for
special investigations is clearly defined and the existing uncertainties on
specific conditions of employment, the powers of the unit and the
relationship between this body, the police and the National Prosecuting
Authority are properly spelt out.

We wish particularly to commend the hon De Lange for the special efforts he
made to ensure that these uncertainties were promptly addressed so that
fears that the Directorate of Special Operations was a disguised
extraconstitutional special force could be shown to have been groundless
once and for all. The unit will also conduct credible investigations and
ensure that prosecutions of high quality take place and justice, in the
end, will be seen to be done on behalf of all victims of crime, both black
and white, and not for one racial group only and to the detriment or
neglect of the other.

The Bill concentrates the prosecuting and investigation operations of crime
under one national authority command structure, and no doubt the current
pattern of mysterious loopholes in the investigation and prosecution of
criminals will come to an end. We would like to urge the Government to make
crime a number one priority in South Africa, even if it means cutting down
on other priority areas.

It is, however, hoped that the unit will not be corrupted like other
Government institutions and, in this respect, the strict control measures
such as the requirement for the Auditor-General to audit the finances of
the unit and the regular screening and use of lie detectors will go a long
way towards making the process a useful and successful tool in addressing
crime, which is the number one scourge in our society. This Bill is an
important piece of ammunition in our war against crime. Let us all play our
parts earnestly and honestly. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson and hon Ministers, as already indicated, the aim
of the amending Bill is to establish a specialised unit to gather
intelligence and to ensure that investigations and prosecutions of serious
offences are carried out in the best possible manner.

Section 179 of the Constitution provides for the establishment of a single
prosecuting authority in the Republic. For reasons of clarity, the ACDP was
one of the parties which recommended that the existing National Prosecuting
Authority Act be amended to include provisions relating to the Directorate
of Special Operations, as opposed to the initial suggestion of a separate
Bill creating a stand-alone structure.

In the case of State v Botha, the High Court stated that modern society is
so specialised that no police force can by itself investigate and prevent
all crime. This philosophy underpins the provisions of section 205 of the
Constitution which, whilst dealing with the South African Police Service,
does not prohibit the creation of other investigating bodies such as the
Directorate of Special Operations.

The National Director of Public Prosecutions, Adv Ngcuka, furthermore
recently stated that perhaps one of the most disturbing features of
criminal justice was that whereas in some areas criminals were developing
and mastering novel and sophisticated means of plying their trade, police
officers, prosecutors and judicial officers were falling behind. We in the
ACDP are similarly concerned about high levels of crime, including the
murder of police officers and farmers as referred to by previous speakers.
In this regard, last year our Constitutional Court, in upholding stricter
bail legislation, agreed with the state's submissions that there could be
no quibble that over the past few years our society has experienced a
deplorable level of violent crime, particularly murder, armed robbery,
assault and rape, including sexual assault on children. The court went on
to say that there could be no doubt that the effect of widespread violent
crime was deeply destructive of the fabric of our society and that,
accordingly, all steps that could reasonably be taken to curb violent crime
should be taken. This makes the effective combating of crime particularly
urgent, and is the reason why the ACDP supports this amendment which
establishes the Scorpions.

As far as jurisdiction is concerned, clauses 7(1) and 26(2) are important
inasmuch as they allow for the concurrent jurisdiction of the directorate
with the South African Police Service. Should there therefore be any
conflict regarding so-called turf related to dockets referred to the hon
the Minister, clause 31 kicks in, providing the necessary deadlock-breaking
mechanism through the Ministerial Co-ordinating Committee.

The ACDP also welcomes the requirement that special investigators should
regularly undergo security screening to ensure that the directorate is kept
clean from all infiltration. We also welcome provisions prohibiting strike
action by the investigators. In conclusion, the ACDP supports this
legislation and wishes to thank the portfolio committee chairperson, Adv De
Lange, for his dedication in steering the Bill to finality. [Applause.]

Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, I participate in this debate with the honour
and privilege that it deserves.

In his input today, the hon Delport said that the Ministers must use the
Scorpions with discretion. We want to say that the Scorpions are not a
political tool, and I think it would have been more appropriate to call on
the National Director of Public Prosecutions to use the Scorpions in the
interests of the public. I think the hon Delport does not have a problem
with that, except that the hon Mike Ellis has, as usual. [Interjections.]

The activities of the Scorpions essentially involve three institutions,
namely the national prosecuting authority, the South African Police
Service, and our intelligence services and agencies. These three will co-
operate and work together in a co-ordinated fashion in the war against
organised crime and terrorism. The investigation of organised crime and
crime lords will be prosecution-led and backed up by the expertise and
experience provided by our police and intelligence services.

The reason for this prosecution-driven integrated approach can be found in
the fact that our Constitution does not provide that the prevention,
combating or investigation of crime is the exclusive function of any single
institution. This point has already been highlighted by the hon
chairperson, and it is also contained in the preamble to the Bill and does
not require further elucidation.

It must be stated that, from certain quarters, our Constitution has been
cited as an impediment and obstruction to investigations and the successful
fight against crime because, according to these critics, our Constitution
is too liberal. On the other hand, the Scorpions have been described
variously as loose cannons operating outside the ambit of our Constitution.

Neither of these criticisms is valid. Indeed, at the very outset, it must
be stated that all investigations and actions by the Scorpions are carried
out within the parameters of our Constitution. It cannot be otherwise,
because such actions and investigations risk being struck down as
unconstitutional and illegal by our courts.

In other countries where units similar to the Scorpions have been
established, the success of such units is based on a successful, integrated
approach and on the fact that investigations are focused on crime
syndicates and terrorist organisations, their leaders and their methods.
Moreover, the success of such units derives from the fact that
investigators work in highly skilled teams.

Presently the police utilise what we refer to as the ``single docket
system'' to which one investigator may be appointed. At the end of the
process, someone may be arrested and this docket will be handed to a
prosecutor, who, de novo, must then familiarise herself or himself with the
details of the case. Without being overly critical of the system, the major
crime syndicates and terrorist organisations have easily found their way
around it and have developed loopholes which they exploit with impunity.
The Scorpions' approach to organised crime is to use the project or
operational approach which focuses on the strategic planning of
investigations. Most importantly, this strategic planning is a collective
effort involving the prosecuting authority, the police, and the
intelligence services. So, it is not unusual for the Scorpions to have a
multiplicity of documents, all of which may be related to a particular
project or operation.

This strategic planning will, amongst other things, focus on all facets of
a crime syndicate, namely the syndicate heads, the lieutenants and the foot
soldiers, as well as all its criminal activities. In this way, successful
cases will be built against members of that syndicate. If all else fails,
of course, the information gained by the Scorpions could be passed on to
our friends, the Asset Forfeiture Unit and, of course, the SA Revenue
Service for further action by those institutions.

An example of the success achieved by this approach can be found in the
Scorpions' ``Project Perlemoen Poaching''. Acting on intelligence received,
divers were arrested for poaching perlemoen for shipment to the Far East.
The Scorpions decided to conduct an in-depth investigation which resulted
in the arrest of another four people, two of whom were foreign nationals
and syndicate bosses. Further investigations resulted in the arrest of 12
more persons. Whilst this matter is still before our courts, it does not
end there. An interim order was granted to the Asset Forfeiture Unit,
allowing them to seize assets to the value of R1 million.

For some time now, the ANC has expressed concern at the disparate nature of
our criminal justice system. The police have seen their role as basically
ending when an arrest is made and the docket is handed over to the
prosecutor. Many of us in the ANC have expressed our concern at this
approach which is not targeted at achieving convictions, but rather at
achieving arrests. It is also true that most police investigators arrest a
suspect in order that they may carry out further investigations into a
crime.

It has also been the ANC's view that intelligence or information per se is
useless unless that intelligence or information can be put to worthwhile
use. Consequently, the ANC has called for intelligence which can be
converted into credible evidence in court cases. It is our view that this
Bill helps achieve these goals.
Consequently, clauses 22 to 25 of the Bill provide for amendments to the
Interception and Monitoring Prohibition Act, 127 of 1992. In terms of these
amendments the head of the Directorate of Special Operations is empowered
to make applications to a judge for directives with which he or she can
intercept, monitor and tap communications of terrorist organisations and
crime syndicates. We are informed that as a result of the successes already
achieved by the Scorpions the SAPS is currently reviewing their single
docket approach.

It is the view of the ANC that the advent of the Scorpions and the approval
of this Bill will revolutionalise this country's approach to the war
against crime, syndicates and particularly crime in general. Accordingly,
we look forward with great enthusiasm to the further successes of the
Scorpions and we welcome the fear that this Bill strikes in the hearts of
terrorists and crime syndicates as we commend this Bill to the honourable
House. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, while most of you
are co-operating, it is from a certain section that I continue to have a
problem, and I am restraining myself from mentioning you by name. But I do
hope that you do give attention to the person who is up here at the podium.

I think it is totally unfair and unacceptable for you to be carrying on
with conversation regardless of what is going on in the House. So, short of
calling you by name I would like the co-operation that is being extended by
the rest of the House to be given to the speaker at the podium.

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Mr Chairperson, now that I have all the attention I thank
you.

As stated by the hon Dr Delport, the DP supports the amendments to the
National Prosecuting Authority Act, providing for the establishment of the
Directorate of Special Operations. These amendments seem to effect co-
ordination in the investigation of certain specified types of crime. This
ensures a unified approach towards organised crime and attempts to focus
combined efforts on pre-determined priorities. Unco-ordinated attempts to
fight crime in the past have led to allegations of corruption and
complicity in crime. The Bill seeks to prevent this.

The crux of the Act is found in section 7 which provides for the
Directorate of Special Operations to investigate and to carry out any
functions incidental to investigations; where appropriate, institute
criminal proceedings and carry out any necessary functions incidental to
instituting criminal proceedings.

The appointment, remuneration and conditions of service of special
investigators will be determined by the Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Development in consultation with the National Director and
with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance. This is intended to result
in special benefits to these investigators.

Special investigators of the directorate will furthermore be issued with
certificates by the National Director to serve as proof that the employee
is a special investigator enabling him to fulfil the functions as set out
in section 7, thereby ensuring a high calibre of investigators. It is also
reassuring to note that no special investigator may strike, induce or
conspire with any other member of the directorate to strike. For purposes
of the Labour Relations Act of 1995 they are deemed to have been designated
as an essential service in terms of section 71 of that Act.
Political responsibility has been placed with the Interministerial Co-
ordinating Committee, consisting of the Minister of Justice and
Constitutional Development as the chairperson, and the Ministers of
Correctional Services, Defence, Finance, Intelligence, Safety and Security
and other members designated from time to time by the President. This co-
ordinating committee is responsible for the co-ordination of the activities
of the directorate, including the communication and transfer of information
regarding matters falling within the scope of the directorate and the
transfer of investigations to and from the directorate.

Except for the powers bestowed upon a peace officer referred to in the
Criminal Procedure Act of 1977, such special investigators have such other
powers as specified by the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development in consultation with the Minister of Safety and Security. It
is, however, alarming to note that such powers may be specified by notice
in the Gazette. However, such notice must be referred to and approved by
the National Assembly before publication. Some form of scrutiny by
Parliament therefore exists in determining which additional powers the
special investigators will have.
The fact that regulations will be issued in terms of clause 37 of the Bill
makes it clear that the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development
will have wide-ranging powers relating to the practical and day-to-day
issues of the directorate. The scope of clause 37 and the 21 subsections
relating to this proposed section leaves the responsible Minister with
little if any scope to deny responsibility for the proper and responsible
functioning of this directorate in the fight against crime.

The community has a right and is entitled to demand that this directorate
contributes substantially to the fight against and eradication of crime
within our society. Whatever excuses the hon the Minister for Justice and
Constitutional Development and the hon the Minister of Safety and Security
had for not combating crime, they have all been addressed. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek dien nie in die portefeuljekomitee
nie, en ek maak verskoning vir genl Viljoen wat nie vanmiddag hier kan wees
nie. Die VF het vanmiddag 'n voorstel in hierdie Raad ingedien oor nog 'n
boer wat vermoor is.

Ons het vanmiddag die syfers hier gehoor van vorige sprekers dat daar
gemiddeld 5 uit elke 100 000 mense in die wêreld vermoor word teenoor die
syfer in Suid-Afrika net ten opsigte van boere, wat 274 uit elke 100 000
is. Die afgelope vyf jaar pleit ons - die VF spesifiek, maar ook almal in
die Raad - dat daar drasties teen misdaad opgetree moet word. Dan bedoel
ons alle misdaad, en nie net dié teen boere nie. Sonder twyfel is dit een
van die ernstigste ...

'n AGB LID: Alle misdaad!

Dr P W A MULDER: Ek het gesê alle misdaad, en u het netnou daar anderkant
'n ding oor boere gesê wat my baie warm gemaak het. Ek hoop ek het u
verkeerd gehoor toe u misdaad teen boere anders gehanteer het as alle
misdaad. Die syfer van 274 moorde per 100 000 boere, die hoogste in die
land, is 'n baie ernstige syfer.

Ons pleit reeds jare lank dat die Polisie meer geld, meer mannekrag en meer
opleiding moet kry om hierdie probleme op te los. Tot nou toe het dit egter
nie gebeur nie. In plaas daarvan is in Julie aangekondig dat hierdie elite-
eenheid, die Skerpioene, gestig gaan word. Ons het destyds by monde van
genl Viljoen ons besware daarteen geopper. Om byvoorbeeld die elite-eenheid
buite die Polisie te stig werk nie na ons mening nie, want dit is 'n klap
in die gesig van die Polisie.

Die Regering sê eintlik daarmee dat hulle nie hul werk goed genoeg doen
nie. Miskien kan 'n mens nog binne in die Polisie so iets kry, maar
daarbuite sal dit spanning skep. Veral die kruisbeheer, het ons gesê, gaan
lei tot chaos in plaas daarvan dat dit misdaad sal bekamp. Die Polisie se
reaksie op die Skerpioene was ook nie positief nie. Veral as na salarisse
gekyk word, skep dit groot spanning, en ons voorspel dit gaan vorentoe nog
meer spanning skep.

Wat ons betref, is hierdie probleme ongelukkig nie voldoende in die
wetgewing opgelos nie. Die VF verwelkom maatreëls wat help om misdaad uit
te roei, maar ons is bevrees dat hierdie nie die antwoord gaan wees nie en
dat dit ongelukkig in die lang termyn so bewys sal word. Die VF gaan teen
die wetgewing stem. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, I do not serve on the portfolio committee,
and I want to apologise for Gen Viljoen, who cannot be here this afternoon.
The FF submitted a motion in this House this afternoon about another farmer
who has been murdered.

We heard the figure here this afternoon from previous speakers that on
average 5 out of every 100 000 people in the world are murdered in contrast
to the figure in respect of farmers alone in South Africa, which is 274 out
of every 100 000. For the past five years we have been appealing - the FF
specifically, but also everyone in the House - that drastic action should
be taken against crime. Then we mean all crime, and not just that
perpetrated against farmers. Without a doubt this is one of the most
serious ...

An HON MEMBER: All crime!

Dr P W A MULDER: I did say all crime, and just now you said something about
farmers over there that made me very hot under the collar. I hope I heard
you incorrectly when you dealt with the murder of farmers differently from
that of all crime. The figure of 274 murders per 100 000 farmers, the
highest in the country, is a very serious figure.

We have already been appealing for years that the Police should be given
more money, more manpower and more training to resolve these problems. As
yet this has not happened. Instead the announcement was made in July that
an elite unit, the Scorpions, was going to be established. At that stage,
we voiced our objections to this through Gen Viljoen. For example, to
establish the elite unit outside of the Police in our view does not work,
because it is a slap in the face of the Police.

The Government is, in fact, saying that they are not doing their job
properly. Perhaps one could still establish such a unit in the Police, but
out there it will create tension. The cross-control in particular, we have
said, is going to cause chaos instead of combating crime. The reaction of
the Police to the Scorpions was not favourable either. When one looks at
salaries specifically, great tension is created, and we predict that this
is going to create more tension in the future.

As far as we are concerned these problems are unfortunately not resolved
adequately in the legislation. The FF welcomes measures that help to
eradicate crime, but we are afraid that this will not be the answer, and
that in the long term this will unfortunately be proved to be correct. The
FF will vote against the legislation.]
Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson, Ministers of Safety and Security and for
Justice and Constitutional Development, colleagues and friends, allow me
first of all to thank the opposition parties, including the DP and the New
NP, for supporting this Bill, which I think is a good and a positive
message that we as South Africans are united in the fight against crime.

Section 1 of our Constitution stipulates that the Republic of South Africa
is one, sovereign democratic state founded on, amongst other values, the
supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. Section 2 takes the
matter even further by stating that law or conduct inconsistent with the
Constitution is invalid and that obligations imposed by the Constitution
must be fulfilled.

One of these obligations is contained in section 179 (2), which grants the
prosecuting authority -


  ... the power to institute criminal proceedings on behalf of the state,
  and to carry out any necessary functions incidental to instituting
  criminal proceedings.

The Bill before us, popularly known as the ``Scorpions Bill'', is a clear
and firm note to those criminals who seek to undermine and exploit our
newly founded democratic and human rights-based state so as to advance
their own selfish and narrow interests, that our patience has run out.

Indeed, hon members will recall that the President, in his address to this
House at the opening of Parliament on 25 June 1999, announced the
establishment of a special investigation unit to deal with national
priority crimes. To achieve this, he reported that he had directed the
Ministers of Safety and Security, Defence, Intelligence, Justice, Home
Affairs and Finance to finalise the activation of this unit as a matter of
urgency. In July 1999, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development and the Minister of Safety and Security announced the creation
of the Directorate of Special Operations, which was officially launched in
September 1999.

The Bill before us is intended to provide the necessary legal framework
that will enable this directorate to perform its task effectively. For this
proposed new law against crime to sustain any constitutional challenge
before our courts, however, it has to be shown that it does not in any way
undermine the letter and the spirit of the Constitution.

In view of the doubts that were expressed by some commentators regarding
the constitutionality of this Bill when it was introduced in Parliament,
the committee requested a legal opinion from the Chief State Law Adviser
whose kind response has provided useful guidance on the matter. At issue
was whether this Bill would not have the effect of exceeding the
institutional and functional boundaries set out in the Constitution, if
any, between the prosecuting authority established under section 179, on
the one hand, and the police under section 205, on the other. More
specifically, it was contested by some that section 205(3), which
explicitly states that ``the objects of the police service are to prevent,
combat and investigate crime'', was intended to accord these powers
exclusively to the police.

In this regard, it must, from the very outset, be stated that neither the
aforesaid provision nor any other provision of the Constitution goes so far
as to establish these powers as the exclusive preserve of the police. If
this was the case, innovative crime prevention mechanisms such as citizens
arrests would be rendered unconstitutional and, therefore, unlawful, more
so, the entire private security industry which is a significant part of our
security services in this country would be rendered illegal.

A counterargument to this proposition is based, amongst others, on the
ground that the ultimate battle against crime is fought in court before a
judge or a magistrate by a team representing the state and led by the
prosecution on whose shoulders rests the ultimate responsibility of
securing the conviction of the perpetrator of the crime. Moreover, the
provision in the Constitution, as I have indicated, does not restrict the
power of the prosecuting authority only to instituting criminal proceedings
on behalf of the state but, on the contrary allows it to carry out any
necessary functions incidental thereto.

This Bill grants the prosecuting authority greater latitude to deal more
effectively with serious crimes such as organised crime, in particular,
within the framework of its constitutional responsibilities. Such latitude
includes the power to conduct investigations and to perform other related
functions.

Once again, it can never be said loudly enough that our crime prevention
and crime combating strategies are under constant challenge by the ever
elusive acts of those who are inspired by the evil one. For us to stay
ahead of this race, we need to be constantly innovative and smart.
[Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Mr Chairperson, I have with me a number of newspaper
articles which deal with this Bill that was initially tabled in the
portfolio committee.

Human Rights Lawyers were suggesting all manner of things such as that the
Bill contained draconian provisions which gave investigators wide and
awesome powers of search and seizure and interrogation. Pretoria News, The
Star and other newspapers ran editorials that suggested that the Government
wanted ``a Presidential police force'', to use the unfortunate words of an
hon member of this House - and he knows who he is. The Pretoria News
editorial went on to prophesy the return of the state security machinery
under the resurrected P W Botha era.
There appears to be an overreadiness on the part of some people in our
society to infer the worst of intentions on the part of this Government.
The same commentators cry foul at every opportunity, particularly when it
pertains to the fight against crime. When the Government puts its money
where its mouth is, suddenly there are visions of the reign of terror and
the resurrection of the P W Botha era. People are all too ready to forget
that this Government, unlike the P W Botha government, was elected into
office on the strength of the majority of enfranchised South Africans who
expect it to take decisive measures in dealing with crime.

Just in case there remains any lingering doubt on the part of anyone as to
the need for the Scorpions, as we have heard today that there appears to be
some of that, I wish to point to some of their successes. Because of the
lack of time I will try and confine myself to the Western Cape Province,
save to point out that within two weeks of their deployment in the Eastern
Cape the Scorpions managed to decisively quell the taxi violence there.

In this province, some of the priorities include gang-related violence,
taxi violence and the urban terror campaign that has been raging here. In
regard to gang-related violence, let me allude to one of the many success
stories. A gang operating in and around the Belhar and Elsies River area,
called the Sexy Boys, has engaged in a number of atrocities, including
murder, attempted murder and other serious crimes. Currently 15 accused are
before a court and bail has been refused in 10 instances. In the matter of
the attacks on the Golden Arrow buses, five key arrests have been made, and
collectively these people face 38 counts of murder and attempted murder.

In the matter of urban terror in this province, there have been a total of
18 timer-device pipe bombs over the period 1998 to 2000. Included in this
figure are the well-known attacks on Planet Hollywood, the Blah Bar and the
New York Bagel. Less well known are the attacks on Campwell Hardware Store
in Grassy Park; Data Trading in Rylands, Athlone; O&J Car Sales in Athlone;
Toyo Retreaders in Athlone and a few other attacks on private residences,
again, in the same communities.

What is interesting is that the attacks in traditionally black communities
have received less press coverage than those in urban Cape Town. There have
been seven cellphone-triggered pipe bombs and - wait for it - 151 striker
pipe bombs during the period 1996 to 1999 in Athlone, Mitchells Plain and
Grassy Park. It remains a mystery to me as to why no media prominence has
been given to these 151 attacks. I leave it to the House to ponder.

Since Idoc began its investigations into urban terror in 1998, 35 people
have been taken off the streets of Cape Town and are in custody and have
been denied bail. An additional 20 people have been granted bail, but are
facing charges relating to urban terror activities. There are altogether 78
matters before court. To give members an idea of the amount of work
involved, in just one of these cases, the accused faces 147 charges. Other
matters currently before the court include individuals charged with the
bombing of the Wynberg synagogue and another case involving the person who
stands accused of killing four-year-old Sedicka Hendricks, in an apparent
vigilante attack.

Internationally urban terror has proved to be more difficult to combat than
other crimes. It is true that much remains to be achieved and we certainly
believe that the Scorpions will prove themselves even more worthy than they
already have within the formal structures provided for in this piece of
legislation. They deserve our unwavering support, they deserve the
unwavering support of the media, who constantly call on this Government to
do more to fight crime, and they certainly deserve the support of all law-
abiding citizens.

I trust that the FF, despite the fact that they do not actively engage in
the portfolio committee deliberations, will actually reconsider their
stance in this light. It is quite important that we in this House are all
seen to be supportive of these very tough measures to fight crime.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before giving the floor to the
hon the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development, may I remark,
for those who are astrologically minded, that the Scorpions' star sign is
Scorpio. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, the
only thing I want to say to this House is that I am very happy and that I
wish to thank and commend all the hon members who participated in this
debate and the parties that they represent for the generous spirit in which
they conducted this debate. As the last speaker has indicated, with the
birth of the Scorpions, we are much stronger in the fight against crime.

I can only add one or two very interesting cases which suggest that,
indeed, the battle against crime is not lost. It is true that a couple of
weeks back we arrested one of the major gangsters involved in the
international illicit drug trade, a man popularly known in those circles as
Pappas. He is behind bars. He and others had brought into our country about
4,5 tons of Mandrax. He is behind bars, and our courts have refused him
bail. [Applause.]

This could only be done because of the approach that is being adopted, not
by the Scorpions alone, but by the Scorpions, the police, the National
Intelligence Agency and the prosecuting authority, to the work that they
are doing.

I can only say, also - it is true, is it not? - that last week, again
through properly co-ordinated work, including proper gathering of
information - or intelligence, to sound a bit more sophisticated - we were
able to pick up 8,5 tons of hashish, as a ship was about to leave Durban.
Again, it is success. [Applause.]

We were asked, in the course of the debate, to consider coming up with a
strategy to combat crime. I would beg to differ with the hon member and say
it is not necessary for us to come up with yet another strategy. We have
the National Crime Prevention Strategy, which is being implemented. Of
course, hon members are free to proffer ideas and suggestions, if only to
strengthen, not only the NCPS, but also the way we are implementing it. We
do not have to reinvent the NCPS.

We have said, and I think we need to stress this, that there will not be
any Scorpions police stations, but the Scorpions are actually going to be
called upon to perform special tasks with particular regard to organised
crime. So one will not be able to go to a particular place to report a
particular crime, but one will have to go to one's police station to report
an offence. It is only then that we will be able to evaluate whether or not
what we are grappling with is part of organised crime or an ordinary crime.

Again, the question of professional jealousy has been mentioned. I think,
in this regard, I need only say that we depend, as I did say in my remarks,
on leadership and on people, eventually. In the USA they always remind us
of the FBI under J Edgar Hoover. They say that for a very long time indeed
the Hoover FBI put more emphasis on quantity rather than on the quality of
the investigations. They would target just anybody who had committed any
offence, including breaking a small window to steal a little radio. They
regarded that as FBI work. We have no intention of repeating that. I think
we have learned from the experiences of others.

I also have to say that in the whole country, the experience of the past
year, indeed, has been that there has been more co-operation between the
Scorpions and the national prosecuting authority on the one hand and the SA
Police Service on the other. That is why we have been able to do so much
already.

I only want to say to the criminal element, in the few seconds left for me
to speak, that the battle against them and their nefarious activities has
been joined. [Applause.]
