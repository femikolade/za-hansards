the House, I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

       Ntabankulu region and which has, on this occasion, caused
       considerable damage;

of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -

       comrades-in-arms position towards Zimbabwe, which has potentially

[Interjections.]

       Africa is preferring narrow party interests to national ones;

House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its deep condolences with the family of Misha Stofberg who

       back beyond the support and topple on top of her;
  (2) further expresses its condolences to the relatives of all other
       victims of such tragedies;

       occurring ...

[Time expired.]

Mr D J SITHOLE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the contents of the Public Service Commission's latest report
       on the management of remunerated overtime, in particular -


       (a)  that significant increases in the use of overtime paid by
           Government departments between 1994 and 1998 have been
           identified by the commission; and

       (b)  that the cost of overtime payments are set to increase still

[Applause.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Mr Chairman, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the farm invasions in Zimbabwe emanate from the inability
       and unwillingness of its government to implement land reform in an
       orderly and constitutional way ...

[Interjections.]


  (2) is proud that in South Africa land reform is managed according to
       constitutional guidelines;

  (3) is concerned that less than 1% of the land surface area has been
       redistributed since 1994, a fact that leads to inevitable
       frustration, which could be the reason for the threat of farm
       invasions by farm workers in Mpumalanga; and

  (4) requests the Government to accelerate land reform in South Africa,
       without creating unrealistic expectations, by making available farms
       owned by Government and the Land Bank, for commercial farming
       practice by adequately empowered emerging farmers.

Mr C T FROLICK: Mr Chairman, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the SA cricket team, under the captaincy of Shaun
       Pollock, on their morale-boosting victory, not only over the
       Australian team but also over huge adversity;

  (2) acknowledges that our cricketers have once again shown that they are
       amongst the best in the world and that they do possess the pride and
       passion to represent our country; and

  (3) commends the United Cricket Board, under the guidance of Dr Bacher,
       for its efforts to transform the sport and for its readiness to deal
       with any crisis so that cricket can remain the people's sport.

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the DP's ridiculous accusation in the media that the ANC's call
       for all parties to support land reform in our country is a threat to
       South Africans;

  (2) acknowledges the ANC's passionate commitment to the rule of law, land
       reform within a constitutional and legislative framework and trade
       union rights within the borders of South Africa and wherever else
       these principles are being threatened ...

[Interjections.]


  (3) recognises that the DP's ludicrous interpretation can only be based
       on their mischievous dishonesty or sincere ignorance ...

[Interjections.]


  (4) calls on the Chief Whip of the opposition to refrain from
       scaremongering for politically opportunistic reasons and from
       spreading lies about the deeply held beliefs and principles of
       others.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, please withdraw
the word ``lies''.

Mr T M GONIWE: Chairperson, I withdraw unconditionally.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: He should also withdraw
the words ``mischievous dishonesty'' which he reputed to me as well.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mischievous dishonesty?

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, on a point of order: I draw your attention to
the fact that that was not simply a speech by the hon member. It is, in
fact, a motion. In view of the fact that the motion contains
unparliamentary statements and words, it should be struck from the record.
It should not be permitted as a motion. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, we will look at
the motion and decide whether the language in which it is couched is
parliamentary or not. As a motion, we cannot rule it out totally.
[Applause.] Mr Andrew, we will strike out the unparliamentary words in the
motion. I will not debate the issue, sir.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, I am not debating the matter. [Interjections.]
What I am suggesting is that if one strikes out unparliamentary words in a
motion, the motion becomes incomprehensible. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Ken Andrew, we will make
certain that it is comprehensible to every member of this House. The
unparliamentary words will be struck out and words that are usable and
parliamentary will be kept.

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I am not going to debate the
issue!

Mr K M ANDREW: Chairperson, I just want to ask you a question for the sake
of clarity.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! No, I will not allow you to
ask a question. I have given you leeway on that issue twice. Please be
seated. [Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: But, Chairperson, I just want to ask a question!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Ken Andrew, please be
seated!

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the country's policy on agriculture favours commercial
       farmers rather than small-scale women farmers;

  (2) observes that small-scale women farmers utilise land efficiently and
       productively;

  (3) urges that the agricultural policy must offer financial, technical
       and technological assistance to help African women farmers to gain
       access to markets; and

  (4) acknowledges that there is a need to provide infrastructure, such as
       roads and transport, as part of the policy on agriculture to enhance
       women farmers' efforts.

Mr M A MANGENA: Chair, I give notice that at the next sitting of the House
I shall move on behalf of Azapo:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the excellent work done by the SANDF in rescuing flood victims
       in Mozambique;

  (2) also notes that by their brave and compassionate actions they have
       become the darlings of all our people;

  (3) observes that there are bridges of critical importance which have
       been washed away by floods in our own country;

  (4) acknowledges that some of the affected communities, such as Nzhelile
       in the far Northern Province, are experiencing great difficulties in
       surviving as a result;

  (5) further acknowledges that it might take some time for sufficient
       resources to be mobilised to rebuild the bridges; and

  (6) therefore calls upon the Ministry of Defence to consider using army
       engineers to build temporary bridges where these are of critical
       importance.

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the utterances made during the course of legal action in the
           Labour Appeal Court in the case of Whitehead v Woolworths; and

       (b)  that discrimination on the grounds of gender and pregnancy is
           prohibited, both in terms of the Constitution and the Promotion
           of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act;


  (2) expresses its concern that a senior member of the legal profession
       could compare a pregnant women with ``a male porn star suffering from
       erectile dysfunction''; and

  (3) continues its advocacy of gender equity and fair labour practice for
       all the women of South Africa.

[Applause.]

Mr J H SLABBERT: Chair, I give notice that on the next sitting day of the
House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  taxi operators have for many years continued to settle disputes
           and disagreements with violence and excessive force; and

       (b)  innocent civilians, such as our fellow citizens who died in the
           Kranskop ambush today, continue to pay with their lives on
           account of this total lawlessness;


  (2) begs the authorities to ensure that taxi operators who contribute to
       lawlessness, death and wanton destruction are totally denied the
       right to operate within the industry;

  (3) suggests that every taxi operator be required, periodically and under
       solemn oath, to give an undertaking never to resort to violence or
       force to resolve any dispute; and

  (4) requests that such an undertaking be made a prerequisite for a taxi
       operator to obtain a licence and that such an operator retains it
       only for as long as he or she offers a service that is strictly in
       accordance with this solemn undertaking.
Mr S J LEEUW: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the publication of draft regulations by the Department of
       Finance in terms of the Public Finance Management Act;

  (2) believes that the regulations will serve to ensure that Government
       departments perform their duties in a consistent and responsible
       fashion, within an approved regulatory framework, as opposed to the
       haphazard and arbitrary way in which government departments were run
       prior to 1994; and

  (3) commends the Government and the Department of Finance for introducing
       systems that will enhance the ability of the House to fulfil its
       oversight function, as required by the Constitution.

[Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 24 - Public Service and Administration, Vote No 25 -
Public Service Commission and Vote No 27 - SA Management Development
Institute:

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Chairperson,
members of this House, those members of the public in the gallery who have
joined us variously from communities and universities and, above all, my
social partners in the trade union movement who are joining me as I present
my first Vote as Minister for the Public Service and Administration ...
[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER: This Vote covers the Department of the Public Service and
Administration, the SA Management Development Institute and the Public
Service Commission. It also refers to the work done by the State
Information Technology Agency.

In the state of the nation address by the President, he stated: ``We are
yet to complete the task of restructuring the machinery of Government.''
Why is this such an important challenge for us as a country? South Africa
has declared war, as a democratic Government, on poverty and
underdevelopment. And unless it is underpinned by a Public Service ...
[Interjections] ... that is effective, developmental and efficient, our
country cannot rise to the occasion of defeating poverty.

Hence, central to this, is our ensuring the complete transformation of the
Public Service, which is essential and critical for the transformation of
the state. The Public Service is the visible face of the state for every
citizen, from cradle to grave - be it for registering births, educating our
children, getting identity documents, or any range of services, we all
interface with the Public Service in one way or another. We are, therefore,
obligated to take an active interest in the process of the Public Service
transformation. This requires each and every public servant to be a patriot
and a role-model of the values that this Government stands for.

My input today will be a report on progress made, and it will outline the
plans for the restructuring of the Public Service. What do we mean by
transformation? [Interjections.] In transforming the Public Service, we
should ensure that the needs and convenience of citizens drive the
provision of services, that services are of a high quality, and that
services are indeed accessible to those for whom they are identified. Above
all, services should be delivered in a manner that empowers the citizenry.

Although cost-containment is the key feature of the restructuring process,
it is not the sole criterion through which we judge the performance of the
Public Service. This is important, as Public Service organisations such as
schools, clinics and police stations are effective and developmental. They
contribute to society to a much greater extent than their cost.

We are not advocating change in pursuit of simplistic notions, favoured by
certain theorists, that the state should be rolled back in favour of market
forces. It must be a change with the principled motive to afford our
country a human face, and to ensure that each and every South African will
indeed benefit from a democratic Government. We are not removing the
responsibilities of the state in relation to social and economic
development. We are rather looking at building a strong, effective,
developmental state. We are making changes that give the state the capacity
to deliver better services. We are improving the systems and infrastructure
of the state to incorporate modern technology and systems. We are ensuring
that more money gets spent on development rather than on administration.

Now, we have succeeded in removing historical inequalities in legislation
and the exercise of Government affairs, including the equalisation of wages
and benefits as well as increasing the accessibility of Public Service
employment to allow for greater representivity. Women now make up 51% of
the total component in the Public Service. There is still
underrepresentation of women at senior management and technical levels. I
want to add that African women are the fastest growing component in the
Public Service.

We have developed policy, regulations and legislation to allow for the
decentralisation of management in the Public Service and the creation of a
more flexible and responsive framework for service delivery. We are
introducing modern systems and practices in all spheres of management, and
we have launched the Batho Pele programme to build a culture of customer
service among public servants, and we want to encourage departments to set
quality standards against which they can be judged by their customers.

We have to build on the solid foundation we have laid in terms of some of
the issues we have raised. Our future efforts will be focused on the
following issues: firstly, the intensifying of the modernisation of Public
Service systems and practices, and, secondly, the continuation of the quest
for better quality services and looking at stabilising personnel
expenditure. Let us reflect on these issues in detail.

On the issue of strengthening management capacities, of all the key
challenges facing the Public Service today, nothing is more central than
the need to attract, develop and sustain capable managers. We are currently
reviewing our approach to the senior management corps, and among the key
changes that we are introducing are the establishment of a separate and
professional senior management service. We need to attract and retain the
very best citizens and, above all, patriots to run our public institutions
and ensure that all departments have a uniformly high standard of
management.

We want improved prerecruitment screening to ensure that only the very best
enter senior management service, and we want the remuneration of management
to be risk-based and linked to performance. There should be greater
contract flexibility with a transparent salary package, and there must be a
tighter system of performance assessment with suitable bonuses for top
performers.

All management positions in the Public Service will be subjected to
competency profiling. What we will ensure is that there will be greater
devolving of powers, and we have ensured this through heads of departments
holding senior managers responsible for output, rewarding performance and
ensuring that disciplinary measures are taken against those who perform
poorly.

We want to introduce clearly established guidelines regarding conduct of
senior managers. We have recently introduced regulations governing the
financial interests of senior managers and plan to cascade this downwards
and extend the regulations to other aspects of conduct. Of course, we are
looking at broadening the definition of managers to include the managers of
service delivery institutions such as hospitals, prisons, schools and other
operational entities. We are also strengthening the capacities of our
accounting officers through the presidential leadership development
programme for directors-general and heads of departments. We will be
launching this in May this year.

Personnel expenditure has increased immensely over the past five years for
very legitimate reasons: the rationalisation and incorporation of the
homeland systems into one South African Public Service, expansion in the
use of benefits and, of course, substantial and appropriate increases in
the minimum salaries for lower-graded workers. These increases in personnel
expenditure have further been exacerbated by the automatic rank-and-leg
promotion system in the Public Service.

On reviewing this, we do accept that this pattern of growth, as we have
seen over the past five years, is neither affordable nor sustainable. With
a deep understanding of the reasons for the increases in personnel
expenditure, there is clearly a need to manage, control and stabilise
expenditure. In order to stabilise expenditure levels, a number of
strategies are necessary. Some of these we will be dealing with in detail
in the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Chamber. However, today I
need to highlight some of these areas.

The costly scrapping of automatic rank-and-leg promotions is unmanageable
and not directly linked to the improvement of service delivery. In its
place we propose a pay progression system that is linked to performance and
career pathing. As I have said earlier, the details of this matter will be
negotiated with the trade unions. More cost-effective benefits and
allowances are being explored. Here we are looking at housing, pension and
medical assistance for the benefit of employees and, of course, a better
role to be played by the employer.
Systems will be put in place to curtail the abuse of the leave dispensation
in the Public Service. By way of a motion reference was made to the study
done by the Public Service Commission. This will include capping leave
accumulation and complying with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. We
will also ensure that we develop a labour relations framework suitable to
the Public Service sector. We will review the application of certain
aspects of national labour legislation, in particular the Labour Relations
Act and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, to the Public Service and
particularly focus on the health and security services.

We are also reviewing the current voluntary severance package because that
framework is not cost effective and has not produced the desired results.
It has, therefore, become necessary to develop a tool that will serve as
the basis for managing personnel who are in excess to operational
requirements, in order to ensure that the Public Service operates as a
skilled, cost-effective and efficient organisation and to ensure that the
state indeed does play a much better role through its interventions in
respect of service delivery to all communities.

To achieve this objective, the following measures are necessary. We need to
terminate the voluntary severance package in its current form with
immediate effect. We need to put in place a retrenchment tool that will
comply with the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the
Labour Relations Act and other regulations in the Public Service, and the
retrenchment tool needs to be supported by a clear social plan.
Furthermore, the impact of retrenchments on regional and local economies
needs to be alleviated by structuring protected procurement arrangements
that will benefit workers and suppliers in these areas.

Those departments that face the problem of personnel in excess to service
delivery requirements will ensure that they have, and have started working
on, strategies to address this challenge. These strategies include
reskilling, retraining, redeployment and, as a last resort, a very final
option, retrenchment. The social plan that they and all of us need to put
on the table needs to incorporate a number of initiatives. Some of these
are advice on financial management to affected individuals, counselling for
retrenchees, assessment of individual skills and identification of areas
for further training, and advice on and facilitation of employment
opportunities elsewhere in the economy. We need to ensure that there is a
comprehensive approach regarding this that involves both economic and
social departments as we take this forward.

Retrenchment in the Public Service, as I stated earlier, will have an
impact on regional and local economies, especially in provinces where the
Public Service is the principal employer. It is, therefore, imperative that
we bear this in mind as we move forward. What is key is to place
alternatives in order to deal with the negative effects on communities in
these particular provinces. We have worked on possible proposals in this
regard. These will include - and do include - public-private partnerships
which will benefit local and regional economies. It looks at outsourcing in
some instances, which will increase the quality and volume of service
delivery and retain jobs that may have been lost otherwise, and at agencies
that will carry forward these services and, in many instances agencies that
will be drawn back and reintegrated into Government at a future point.

Moving on from that point, I feel it is important to just reflect of some
of the work being done by the Public Service Commission. I am not going to
deal with all the issues. The commission co-ordinates the monitoring of the
implementation of resolutions that emanated from the 1999 national
anticorruption summit. It has put in place a national co-ordinating
structure that is required to manage the national anticorruption programme
as part of an ongoing campaign that it leads and has been launched under
the auspices of Government's national anticorruption initiative.

At present a series of provincial anticorruption workshops are being run to
lend support and mobilise vigilance of provincial administrations in
implementing their plans to curb corruption sand to promote professional
and ethical conduct amongst senior public officials. A risk management
programme designed to focus on and control corruption trends is being
developed. The commission offers support and assistance for the development
of codes of conduct, whether it is for parliamentarians or provincial
legislatures, and the employees of local governments. Systems are also
being looked at for monitoring the implementation of and adherence to codes
by national and provincial departments. This will lead to a reliable
measure of adherence.
In collaboration with the Department of the Public Service and
Administration, a framework for the disclosure of financial assets by
senior management has been developed. The assets register is a mechanism
for accountability and prevention of corruption. It is aimed at deputy
directors, upwards - actually, for all senior managers from the level of
deputy director. This is being implemented from 1 April, and the commission
will monitor the process. However, executing authorities - that is to say,
premiers, MECs and, of course, the national Cabinet and the executive as a
whole - will manage the assets register for senior officials in their
departments.

A further area of challenge is, of course, the whole issue of improving
management skills throughout the Public Service, because senior management
training and development lies at the core of high performance and improved
service delivery to our people. The strategic leadership development
programme that I referred to in the beginning is an executive senior
management programme aimed at improving skills and learning, and is
specifically designed for directors-general and other senior managers.

We, furthermore, are also looking at an African co-operation programme that
seeks to link our Public Service transformation with other African states
in the context of the African renaissance. This forms a direct part of the
strategic leadership development programme.

In terms of looking at improving the quality of service delivery, a recent
analysis by the Department of the Public Service and Administration looked
at how Government delivers services and highlighted the challenges related
to the improvement of service delivery. The separation of Government into
different units, though necessary for administrative purposes, often means
that our people do not receive services in the most convenient manner.

People often have to give the same information more than once to different
government units or sometimes even to the same unit. There is a lack of
information on Government services, and, in many instances, a lack of
clarity on where people should go for help. Our institutions would then
arguably, in some instances, not be as friendly to the public as they
should be. In many instances in rural communities, Government services are
not accessible and people have to travel long distances to access them.

Accessing services is time consuming, and there is insufficient advice on
requirements to access these services. There is also limited information on
business hours in some instances, and, in many instances, not enough hours
for people to access services. Hence, a key strategy for improving the
quality of services is the deepening of a culture of accountability to
citizens on the point of our Government services. Here members heard
various colleagues of mine unveil how they were doing that during the
Budget week.

Our agenda for action, therefore, will build on the Batho Pele principles
and focus on practical initiatives to ensure that services are convenient
for the needs of every citizen. In addition, some of the practical actions
will include the greater use of information technology in service delivery
in which Government will identify services that can be provided on line
without visiting a Government office. We will use the Internet, the
telephone and postal services to extend these services.

The launch of the Public Information Terminal by the Post Office and the
provision of universal telecommunications services will ensure increased
electronic access to services by most communities. Further identification
of services that can be made more accessible through collaboration with the
private sector and other state institutions, such as the Post Office,
police stations and mobile units, is being dealt with. The focus will also
be on increasing information about Government services and the location of
offices.

Efforts will also be made to streamline information required for providing
services, and, of course, this will be in line with the use of information
technology through the State Information Technology Agency. We will ensure
that services are of an appropriate quality and that there is a greater
focus on feedback through members of the community indicating how effective
the services are.

At this stage there is also a need to focus on how we intend ensuring that
our human resource practices support the development objectives of
Government. I will now look at the transforming efforts of Government. We
are replacing automatic promotions with appropriate career-pathing and pay-
progression systems linked to performance. We are introducing a range of
flexible employment practices. We are nurturing a culture of performance
management by developing and implementing a performance management system,
but above all we are promoting ethical conduct by ensuring that there is an
adherence to a code of conduct.

I think at this point one should draw this to a close by saying that
through the State Information Technology Agency, Sita, once again, we will
continue laying the building blocks for electronic Government and we will
finalise a policy on information technology in the course of the year 2000.
Such a policy will provide for the integration of existing Government
systems and data bases. It will map out a single window for providing
Government services on line, electronically address issues of certification
and security in the conduct of Government business, look at using less
paper in administration and, generally, suggest strategies for increasing
the rate of information technology use by Government services.

Finally, I would like to say that clearly the HIV/Aids pandemic has, and
will have, a major impact on the Public Service as a whole. It will be felt
on the Government Employees Pension Fund, on human resources training, on
medical aid and on remuneration and leave. As a result, a major project has
been launched to assess the current status of this pandemic in the Public
Service. The main objective is to ensure that the Public Service is able to
sustain quality service in spite of the epidemic.

I just want to say that in any ascent of a mountain, things may seem
difficult. Prior to that ascent, we may have the full plan and vision of
the journey, but as we go through the journey, some of us may lose sight of
the broader range and get overly focused on the areas we find ourselves in.
We need constantly to remind ourselves of the overall purpose of the climb.
We need to always contextualise the steps we take and the pain we endure to
take those steps. It is only when we stand at the summit that the whole
picture can be appreciated. But we always need to keep this picture in mind
as we go along, otherwise we may lose our way.

The summit that we are aspiring to is the full transformation of the Public
Service - a painful process, but a necessary one. On that note I would like
to quote Brecht, especially for those who decided to heckle me in the
beginning and ran away. As we deal with this transformation, Brecht says:


  I stood on a hill and I saw the old approaching. But it came as the new.
  It hobbled up on new crutches which no one had ever seen before, and
  stank of new smells of decay, which no one had ever smelled before. The
  stone that rolled past was the newest invention, and the screams of the
  gorillas drumming on their chests set up to be the newest musical
  composition.

Let us not drum on our chests and be the newest musical composition on the
complexities. Let us always focus on what the outcome should be, and let us
put in place the fundamentals for that outcome and never be deterred from
that.

On that note, I would like to thank the chairperson of the portfolio
committee for the kind of co-operation that he and his team have provided
in taking us forward on this journey of transforming the Public Service. I
would also like to thank my directors-general, Muthanyi Ramaite, Mpume
Skhosana from the Public Service Commission, and Job Mokgoro, the director-
general of Samdi. I would like to thank the chair of the Public Service
Commission, Prof Sangweni, and the team of commissioners. I would like to
say to them, and all those patriots who are public servants, that they have
a difficult task, but as a team we are going to drive ahead with the
required transformation and restructuring in spite of the gorillas drumming
their chests.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, before I call the
next speaker, I recognise the Speaker of the Zambian Assembly in the
gallery. [Applause.] Sir, you and your delegation are welcome to our
country. May your visit be an enjoyable one.

Mr N P NHLEKO: Chairperson, the Portfolio Committee on the Public Service
and Administration takes this opportunity to congratulate the following
people on their appointments: Mr Robinson Ramaite as Director-General of
the Department of the Public Service and Administration, Mr Job Mokgoro as
Director-General of the SA Management Development Institute and Mr Mpume
Skhosana as Director-General of the Office of the Public Service
Commission. It is to the credit of the hon the Minister that the three key
institutions for whose budget she takes responsibility have begun working
together in a constructive and productive manner. At this stage the
institutions all have well-defined powers and responsibilities.
The Public Service Commission, which commenced work on 1 July 1999, has a
constitutional mandate to monitor and evaluate the performance of
Government departments. A revitalised Samdi came into existence on 1
October 1999 with the mandate to promote management development in the
Public Service, and the Department of the Public Service and Administration
has risen to the challenge of delivering hands-on assistance to
departments, in addition to its ongoing policy-making role, with a vigorous
focus on the implementation of service delivery policies and strategies.
Yesterday, we were also pleased to hear, at the portfolio committee
briefing, that the State Information Technology Agency, Sita, has aligned
its business plans for IT delivery to departments to the priorities of
Government in this area. The mandates of these institutions are
complementary and interdependent, from policy-making to assistance with
implementation; and from the provision and implementation of IT hardware
and systems to capacity-building and monitoring and evaluation of
performance.

For this key strategic realisation, a number of benefits to all
institutions have followed. By focusing on areas of co-operation and co-
ordination, the Department of the Public Service and Administration and the
Public Service Commission in particular have identified joint operations
and are thereby achieving maximum impact. One of the most important of
these joint operations has been the management audits, the first of which
was in the Department of Correctional Services. The directors-general of
the department and the Public Service Commission, with the co-operation of
the Department of Correctional, will be briefing a joint meeting of the
Portfolio Committees on Correctional Services and on the Public Service and
Administration this Friday on the results of the audit.

We applaud these positive steps that have been taken by the Public Service
Commission, Samdi, Sita and the department to co-operate at several levels.
We trust that there will be continuity of these good relations for the
benefit of the Public Service and the people of this country as a whole.
Even before 1994 we were aware that we had to change radically the ethos of
the Public Service in order to improve its performance. There was a
realisation on Government's part that to transform the Public Service and
the state, it was necessary to reposition and sharpen management to meet
our political objectives as a country.

One of the most important ways of doing this was to entrench the concept of
management accountability in the Public Service. Both the Minister of
Finance and the Minister for the Public Service and Administration have
been cognisant of the importance of the regulatory framework - in other
words, the rule books - to transformation and the impact it makes on the
way in which public servants do their work and account for their
performance.

A new approach, and one which was adopted simultaneously in Finance and the
Public Service, was to rewrite these rule books to afford Public Service
managers greater flexibility in terms of how they deliver, while holding
them personally responsible for what they deliver. For the Public Service
and Administration the result was the Public Service management framework
which came into force in July 1999 and the Public Finance Management Act
which came into force this month. Together, these frameworks are now
regulating the Public Service.

The greater advance represented by the implementation of both frameworks is
in securing management accountability for performance. As part of this
framework, all heads of departments are required to sign performance
agreements with their Ministers or MECs. We were informed that there is no
system in place yet for Ministers and MECs to conduct a structured
evaluation of their heads of departments on a regular basis. We are very
pleased to hear that the Public Service Commission has agreed to develop an
appropriate methodology for Ministers and MECs to follow and, in addition,
will provide advice to Ministers and MECs.

We, in Parliament, have a great deal of respect and admiration for the
commissioners and officials of the Public Service Commission who carried
out their duties under difficult conditions during the transition from the
old to the new. We are pleased that the new regulatory framework and the
constitutional provisions regulating the powers and functions of the
commission are now fully operational. We would like to suggest that the
commission's most important contributions to Parliament, and in particular
the National Assembly to which it is accountable, are the reports of the
highest quality which it has tabled since then.

This week a report on the management of remunerated overtime was tabled,
which drew Government and Parliament's attention to the fact that Public
Service spending on overtime has reached levels of R1 billion per year. The
report is one of a series focusing on the financial implications of the
coming into force of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. In essence,
the Public Service Commission is pointing out that the new legal
dispensation will inevitably bring increased costs in terms of overtime
work.

Government has, for some time, already been working to reduce these costs,
in particular through seeking exemptions for the Public Service from
certain aspects of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act. But Government's
wage policy will also make a difference in this particular area because it
will seek to reduce the amount of overtime that public servants currently
regard as part of their salaries by restructuring public servants'
remuneration packages.

Another report of the commission on the annual reports from Government
departments was released during recess. The portfolio committee, together
with the Committee on Public Accounts, has already been looking into the
alignment of the annual reporting requirements of the Public Service and
financial management frameworks. We look forward to providing inputs to the
committee on accountability and oversight, which is taking place in this
crucial area, on behalf of the Rules Committee of Parliament.

We are satisfied that the commission has defined for itself a very
constructive methodology for addressing key focal areas in terms of its
constitutional mandate, and that it has been very productive thus far. The
commission, by tabling its reports in the National Assembly, is also
presenting us as members of Parliament with the challenge of taking up
these issues and engaging with Government to address any problem areas
identified by the commission.

A number of top level studies and reviews have been conducted in the Public
Service since 1994 and they have greatly enhanced our understanding of the
functioning of the Public Service. Most recently, in 1999 Government asked
all departments to draw up management plans aimed at improving planning in
a number of key areas, but having the added benefit of providing a wealth
of management information for analysis at national level. We look forward
to the release, by the hon the Minister for the Public Service and
Administration, of the first annual review report on the Public Service.
In gathering information for ourselves as the portfolio committee, we have
on occasion gone out to see what is happening in the Public Service. We
would therefore like to report briefly on our visits to the Free State and
Mpumalanga. At the same time, two other delegations went to the Eastern
Cape, the Northern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern Province.

Firstly, we must concur with the hon members of the Portfolio Committee on
Transport. In their debate on Tuesday they said that they were facing a
national crisis in terms of the maintenance of our roads. We heard, for
instance, that in Mpumalanga alone they estimated the backlog to be R4
billion. Secondly, we were struck by the fact that there are still many
problems relating to the integration of the former homelands and the
rationalisation of their Public Service dispensations that persist till
today. We are informed that in some other areas, homeland structures have
remained almost untouched or with new names under regional offices, but in
many instances without any work to occupy them constructively.

As yet we do not have a tool for rationalisation when it comes to staffing
matters. This matter surely requires urgent political attention so that
there is complete integration of former homeland structures into the new
dispensation. Such action must be seen within the context of accelerating
change and service delivery.

In fairness to the many dedicated and hard-working politicians and public
servants whom we encountered on our travels, we did see very many positive
developments too, particularly in the area of public-private partnerships
and outsourcing. For example, we saw first-hand the Free State Department
of Welfare's mobile welfare pay-out points system, which won an
international service delivery innovation award in 1998, and which has been
adopted and replicated in several other provinces.

The political justification for the employment of 1,1 million people in the
service of the state is that the Government is responsible, in terms of its
mandate, for the delivery of certain basic services, with the necessary
implication that these services will reach more people efficiently,
effectively and economically. We must constantly ask ourselves whether our
public servants - the human resources of the Public Service - are
appropriately skilled and trained to execute our political objectives as a
country. Properly skilled public servants in the right locations are
essential to improved service delivery, and partnerships and outsourcing
will keep costs down and promote efficiency. However, alternative service
delivery mechanisms must be handled sensitively by Government and fully
consulted upon with the relevant stakeholders.

In the context of our visits to the provinces, we would also like to argue
today for the strengthening of our commitment to the existing service
delivery policy, Batho Pele, or ``people first''. We would like to call on
Government to take bold steps to ensure that this policy is implemented
comprehensively by all departments in the Public Service. We have seen that
the benefits of successful implementation of this policy are enormous, in
particular in reminding public servants of their role as service providers
and in empowering citizens as service users. We appreciate the contribution
of the unions, as social partners, for their commitment to service delivery
and public sector transformation.

Finally, we would like to call on all members of the public to take
ownership of the Batho Pele campaign. This budget is ours and we support
it. [Applause.]
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, on a point of order: I
want to enquire whether it is parliamentary for the DP to address this
House when they do not have a quorum, because most of their members are
busy marching to the Zimbabwean embassy during the sitting hours of this
House. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That is not a point of order.
That is a point of information for everybody. [Laughter.] Please proceed,
hon member.

Mr G A J GROBLER: Chairperson, my colleague will concentrate on Vote 16:
Improvement of Conditions of Service, and I will give more specific
attention to Votes 24, 25 and 27.

During 1999, and more specifically on 22 September 1999, the DP spelt out
its views on the Public Service. We emphasised the need for downsizing the
Public Service, merit increases and privatisation of services, to name a
few things. We were met only with silence from the Minister. However, we
realised that the silence was because the Government was in negotiations
with its ally Cosatu.

Although we were very thankful to hear at the end of 1999 and in the middle
of March 2000 that the hon the Minister would carry out plans to cut back
the Public Service, she admitted that the Government's previously
disastrous attempts at rightsizing had led to the exodus of high-calibre
public servants and left the Government with the deadwood. They lost the
wrong people. The hon the Minister's department is also looking at
outsourcing. The Government's ally Cosatu has not reacted favourably, of
course, but this should not stand in the Minister's way.

At least positive noises are being made regarding the reduction in the size
of the Public Service - one of the central elements of the Government's
macroeconomic policy or strategy, Gear. But the most important issue is
when. When will she get rid of the thousands of public servants who are not
doing a day's work, but are getting paid? The ones who are prepared to work
should rather be paid. Again, there are very positive noises coming from
the Minister. Ideas came forward this afternoon and we really appreciate
this.

Furthermore, positive noises were made at the end of March by the hon the
Minister regarding the lack of commitment from certain public servants,
especially in the mismanagement of funds or, rather, I should say, the
nonmanagement of funds. Promises of a major shake-up, in terms of the
integrated implementation programme, were made in August last year by the
hon the Minister and, again, there were good ideas, but when will we see
the necessary results? However, we are here today. Things are moving.

People are dying in queues while public servants are not doing their work.
Three people died on one day in the Eastern Cape because officials were not
doing their work. Electronic equipment was not functioning owing to
nonpayment of accounts. I am sure that since the day those poor people died
not a single official responsible for this unacceptable situation has been
fired.

During a recent portfolio committee tour to the State Information
Technology Agency, organised by Mr Nathi Nhleko - whom I want to thank
personally as I really found the tour very informative - I was surprised to
learn that an amount of approximately R300 million is owing to Sita for
services rendered to other departments. Again, this is a sure sign of
incompetence on the part of officials on both sides - those who do not
collect outstanding funds and those who do not think it necessary to pay
outstanding accounts.

Sita is a very important institution and it must sell itself in this very
competitive market. How does one do this? One does this by being seen as a
worldclass-performance institution and by delivering an effective,
competitive service, and by not waiting for Government to force departments
to make use of one's services, in this instance those of Sita. One thing I
am very positive about is that we will have to look again at amending the
State Information Technology Act.

Furthermore, I was surprised to see that new equipment worth R40 million
was being installed there. Sita's explanation, which was that they must be
proactive in having the right equipment to cater for the needs of
prospective clients, is recommended. But is it not better to get new
business first and then upgrade one's systems? We have a wonderful asset in
Sita, but it is not being utilised to a fraction of its potential. I am
sure we are going to look at this and hear positive noises again.

Before I come to Vote 25, I want to say that the media was full of the
Human Rights Commission's obsession with various racist reports in the
press. Now, what does that have to do with me today? I am told, for
instance, that when one lodges a complaint with the HRC one has to complete
a question on what one's race is. The Public Service Commission goes even
further on page 10 of their report on dismissals as a result of misconduct
in 1999. Here, misconduct among whites, Indians, blacks and coloureds was
listed under the various race groups. This is, in my opinion, the worst
form of racism in reporting. [Interjections.] Here a certain race group is
being highlighted as more prone to misconduct than any other. It is here on
page 10! [Interjections.] If the hon the Minister Jeff Radebe has some time
to spare I will give it to him to read. We in the DP, and I personally, are
only interested in one race and that is the human race. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr G A J GROBLER: The DP therefore asks for a nonracialistic report of the
various departments in future. We do not need to have these breakdowns on
races who are now prone to misconduct, and so on. [Interjections.]
On the positive side, the DP welcomes the statements from the Public
Service Commission, that the reporting systems of the various state
departments are not up to standard and need to be brushed up. The lack of
proper reporting has for a long time been a serious concern to our party
and many others. We agree that this lack of proper reporting is nothing ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Mr Bloem and hon Mr
Mathebe, I do not see you adding to the debate by yelling from your seats.
So please, contain yourselves. Continue, sir.

Mr G A J GROBLER: There are a few other drummings on their chest from that
side.

I just want to say that more concerns that we share with the Public Service
Commission are listed here, but owing to a lack of time and the
interruptions I will have to go on with my speech.

As gevolg van 'n gebrek aan genoegsame tyd wil ek graag die volgende paar
opmerkings maak ten opsigte van Begrotingspos 27: Die Suid-Afrikaanse
Instituut vir Bestuursontwikkeling, of Samdi soos dit alom bekend staan.

Sedert Oktober 1999 funksioneer dit as 'n volwaardige departement met 'n
eie direkteur-generaal. Die departement het, soos sovele ander afdelings,
eintlik nog geen prestasies gelewer waarop ons trots kan wees nie, maar die
doel van die departement, naamlik om 'n effektiewe rol te speel in bestuur-
en organisatoriese opleiding in die openbare sektor, en om finansieel
selfonderhoudend te wees, klink altyd prysenswaardig. Die vermoë om aan dié
mooi ideale te voldoen, sal egter na gekyk moet word.

Ek stem saam met die nuutaangestelde direkteur-generaal dat opleiding op
sigself, ná alles wat beplan word, nie die alpha en die omega is nie, maar
wel die resultate wat behaal word, en ek het vertroue daarin. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Because I have insufficient time I would like to make the following few
remarks with regard to Vote 27: The SA Management Development Institute, or
Samdi, as it is generally known.

This institute has been functioning as a fully fledged department with its
own director-general since October 1999. As in the case of so many other
sections, the department has as yet not really achieved anything of which
we can be proud, but the objective of the department, ie to play an
effective role in management and organisational training in the public
sector, and to be financially self-sufficient, always sounds praiseworthy.
However, the ability to attain these excellent ideals will have to be
examined.

I agree with the newly appointed director-general that, after everything
that is being planned, the alpha and omega is not training itself, but the
results that are attained, and I have confidence in this.]

Departments were once again identified in which training needed to be done
by Samdi, but my question is, does Samdi have the staff to perform? Does
Samdi have the skills? Does Samdi have the equipment?

In one of the presentations of the new Director-General of the Department
of the Public Service and Administration, he said it could take between 10
and 15 years to transform an institution such as the Public Service. I say
it is totally unacceptable to suggest that timeframe.

Weer eens is die DP nie ongeneë om die departmente wat 'n visie het om sake
reg te stel 'n redelike kans te gee nie, maar 'n tydskedule, en ek sien dit
kom nou stadig in, is noodsaaklik om te verseker dat, indien geen wesenlike
resultate behaal word deur sekere instansies nie, ons dit maar moet
privatiseer sodat hulle byvoorbeeld dan maar vir ons opleiding doen as
hierdie ding nie werk nie. 'n Mens kan nie vir 'n onbepaalde tyd aanhou
nie.

Laastens, die Minister het altyd die voorreg om die laaste sê te hê aan die
einde van 'n begrotingsdebat. Gevolglik sal ek nie die geleentheid kry om
myself te verdedig nie. Ek wil egter net sê, die agb Minister mag dalk voel
om iets goed te sê oor die DP of om my dalk te wil prys, maar ek glo beslis
nie sy sal dit wil doen nie en dat ek in daardie geval ernstig daaraan sou
moet dink dat ek my werklike politieke rol nie behoorlik vervul het nie.
[Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Once again, the DP is not unwilling to give those departments with a
vision to rectify matters a reasonable chance, but a timeframe, and I see
this now gradually emerging, is essential to ensure that if no substantial
results are attained by certain institutions, we simply have to privatise
them to enable them, for example, to undertake training for us if this
effort is not working. One cannot carry on indefinitely.

Finally, the Minister always has the privilege of having the final word at
the end of a budget debate. Consequently I shall not have the opportunity
to defend myself. However, I just want to say that the hon the Minister
might feel like saying something favourable about the DP, or might want to
praise me, but I definitely do not believe that she would want to do that,
and in that case I would have to consider seriously that I have not played
my real political role properly. [Time expired.]]

Prof L B G NDABANDABA: Mr Chairperson, hon members, the IFP fully
recognises the need for administrative transformation of the Public Service
and acknowledges that it is vital that the process of transforming the
Public Service should be guided by a clear, comprehensive and commonly
accepted vision of the fundamental principles that should shape the new
Public Service.

Until recently, the African people were systematically excluded from all
positions of influence in the state and civil society. The IFP is concerned
that persons with disabilities, irrespective of gender and race, are seldom
found in any position of influence within the state. The system of service
provision under the old regime was discriminatory and exclusionary towards
black South Africans. It was concerned more with the application of rules
and procedures than with the development of a culture and ethics of
service.

To this end, the IFP hopes that the central Government's initiatives on the
Public Service will not be prescriptive with regard to the provinces. The
IFP believes that the national Government should guard against dampening
provincial initiatives by imposing centrally controlled measures upon
provinces. Subject to the requirements of national security, the public
should have access to all information available, as in the case of federal
systems. Labour relations should be dealt with at provincial level rather
than national level.

Having said that, the IFP applauds the improvements in the conditions of
service, transformation and the new developments brought about after 1994,
as shown by the following: The process of democratisation has seen the
transformation of the Public Service in terms of the constitutional
obligations and objectives of the current Government. When the Department
of the Public Service and Administration was started, it focused mainly on
the development of administrative policies and legislative frameworks that
sought to guide the transformation process.

In addition, the department supports the Minister in her responsibility to
oversee, facilitate and co-ordinate the transformation process in the
Public Service, as set out in the White Paper on the Transformation of the
Public Service. The department has reached a stage where more emphasis is
now being placed on implementation. It has the responsibility for the
following areas: To translate the broad policy framework contained in the
White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service into achievable
policy objectives, performance measures, targets and timeframes; to ensure
that this process is based on effective consultation with all key
stakeholders and agencies within and outside Government at national and
provincial level; to ensure that the transformation process is effectively
co-ordinated at both national and provincial levels; and to develop a
financial resource strategy to support the transformation process, taking,
of course, into account the specific needs of individual departments and
provinces.

The White Paper on the Transformation of the Public Service identifies
policy objectives, guidelines and instruments in nine areas: the
rationalisation and restructuring of the Public Service; institution-
building and management; representativeness and affirmative action;
transforming service delivery; democratising the state; human resource
development and training; employment policies and conditions, and labour
relations; the promotion of a professional service ethos; and information
technology, which is very important. The main thrust in the area of
legislative reform in the Public Service in recent years was to devolve
powers to executing authorities and provinces, and this is applauded.

Numerous workshops have been held with most political heads and heads of
departments in order to ensure that they understand their new roles and
powers, and the format for management plans. The reform was aimed at
enhancing the accountability of heads of departments, introducing
employment contracts and performance agreements for heads of departments
and modernising inefficiency and misconduct procedures.

The new Public Service regulations have changed the focus towards the
implementation of policy. The practices, procedures and policy norms
proposed in various White Papers will, as a result of the new Public
Service regulations, be enforced. This we applaud. With regard to enhancing
service delivery, one of the Government's important tasks is to build a
Public Service that is capable of meeting the challenge to improve the
delivery of Public Services to South Africans, especially disadvantaged
communities.

At the beginning of 1998 the Department of the Public Service and
Administration launched the Batho Pele White Paper. The department also
interacted extensively with three departments on a pilot project. These
departments included Home Affairs and the North West departments of local
government and housing, health and developmental social welfare, and
finance and economic affairs. They reached agreements on the timetable for
the implementation of the Batho Pele initiative service standards.

The Batho Pele initiative is in the process of being extended to the rest
of the Public Service whose personnel are not regulated by the Public
Service Act of 1994. The key elements of the Batho Pele White Paper were
incorporated into the new Public Service regulations in order to ensure
that they were integrated into all departmental activities.

The Minister for the Public Service and Administration launched the White
Paper on Human Resource Management in the Public Service in February 1998
in Parliament. A number of initiatives were introduced in order to ensure
the successful implementation of the new policies. This, again, we applaud.
The department held a number of workshops with national departments and
provincial administrations. The objectives of these workshops were, inter
alia, to identify problem areas in the staffing function and develop
strategies for addressing these; to obtain inputs so as develop good
practice and guidelines; and collectively to develop key performance
indicators which are realistic and achievable.

Besides the above initiatives, the implementation of the White Paper on
Human Resource Management in the Public Service is being taken forward in
the new Public Service regulations and the development of comprehensive
good practice for the human resource function, which is very important. The
White Paper on Affirmative Action in the Public Service was launched in
1998. The occasion of the launch of the White Paper was used to recognise
the work that has been done by other departments in transforming the Public
Service.

Performance management forms an integral part of the whole process of the
transformation of the Public Service, especially with regard to effective
human resource management and service delivery. Performance management in
terms of the new Public Service regulations is, of course, a radical
departure from the past practice. It puts in place constructive mechanisms
in order to assist employees in improving their performance. In terms of
this new system, management will have to communicate more consistently with
their employees; departments will have to define appropriate instruments
and work with employee organisations to set up appeal routes; and
departments will have to be more creative in overcoming blockages in the
way of good work.

With regard to information technology, the department made significant
progress in the area of information management and information technology
in the Public Service. It was involved, inter alia, in driving the
establishment of the State Information Technology Agency, or Sita; in
finalising the Information Architecture Framework, or IAF, for the Public
Service; and in assisting with the co-ordination of the year 2000, or Y2K,
problem in the Public Service. The Government is better poised now to
deliver IT solutions required by the departments and provinces faster and
more effectively.

The establishment of Sita, as mentioned, will resolve a number of problems
which have been plaguing Government in the IT sector. These problems
include the exodus of IT-skilled personnel to the private sector, the
inability to recruit and retain properly skilled personnel, the inability
to manage IT procurement, the ineffective utilisation of IT resources and
the inability of Government to utilise IT tools to support governance and
service delivery.

With regard to employment conditions and labour relations, the Public
Service Co-ordinating Bargaining Council, or PSCBC, is the negotiating
forum which attempts to reach agreements on salaries, terms and conditions
of work in the Public Service. It has reached a number of agreements that
represent a qualitative step forward in labour relations in the Public
Service. It has reached agreements on some of the following areas. It has
agreed to reduce the funding level of the Government Employees Pension
Fund, and to provide for funds to help the development of sectional
training plans. The PSCBC has established a committee to audit the service
requirements and staffing levels of Government components, integrated with
all departments and activities of the Public Service, human resource
development and affirmative action.

The Minister of the Public Service and Administration has launched in
Parliament the White Paper on Human Resource Development with all these
good ideas in mind. A number of initiatives were introduced to ensure that
this would be successful. Besides the above-mentioned initiatives, the
implementation of the White Paper on Human Resource Management in the
Public Service is being taken forward in the new Public Service regulations
and the development of comprehensive, good practice, as has been
emphasised.

The department has undertaken to conduct a comprehensive review of the
current conditions of service in the Public Service. It believes that
remuneration is the largest single category of Government spending, and
therefore how it is structured is important to the sustainability of
Government spending. The Government wants to direct the bargaining process
towards a more sustainable approach to salary increases, which is an
important factor for all public servants. This will be achieved through
reviewing and negotiating the current conditions of service. Such a review
will include, among other things, a new wage policy; a review of current
benefits, allowances and how they are structured relative to the salary;
reviewing current bargaining processes, including the need for more
sectoral approaches; and narrowing the wage gap whilst developing
strategies to retain professional and senior managers.

Now I would like to make a few remarks about the Public Service Commission
and its achievements. Members of the new Public Service Commission who were
appointed in December 1998 have achieved a lot in the meantime. The
commission has 14 members in total and has been set up in accordance with
constitutional requirements. The commission is an independent body which
has the role of assisting in the promotion of a professional and ethical
Public Service and administration that is accountable - which is in
agreement with IFP philosophy - equitable, efficient, effective and free
from corruption. In order to achieve this vision, the commission has the
power to investigate, monitor, evaluate, communicate and report on public
administration.

Some of the achievements of the commission to date include the following.
Following on the Public Service anticorruption conference which was held in
1998, the commission organised a national anticorruption summit which took
place during 1999. Delegates from all sectors participated in this summit.
One of the central objectives of the commission, of course, is to assist in
the development of principles of good governance and preventing corruption
in the Public Service as a whole. A number of resolutions came out of this
summit, which will be followed up by the national co-ordinating structure.

The commission is highly involved in the practical implementation of the
code of conduct for the Public Service, which was launched and implemented
in 1999. The commission has organised workshops in the provinces to assist
it in the implementation of a code of conduct. This also agrees with the
IFP philosophy of doing things in the provinces.

The commission intervened in a number of important areas, in line with its
mandate to promote effective service delivery and resource utilisation.
These interventions included, inter alia, a report on the evaluation of
departments' annual reports as an accountability mechanism. This report
identified serious problems with the content of departmental annual reports
in terms of their usefulness for ensuring accountability. The commission
has developed guidelines to assist the departments in this regard.

Benchmarking of departments against the key requirements of Batho Pele has
been done by the commission. The purpose of this investigation was to check
the extent to which departments have included policy ... [Time expired.]

Mr M R BALOYI: Mr Chairperson and the honourable House, the Public Service
transformation process is on course and under control, en route to a
destiny of a Public Service with a culture of accountability and
responsiveness. This is a course championed by the Department of the Public
Service and Administration. The pursuit of the transformation agenda runs
paralleled with a commitment to meeting the day-to-day challenges of
rendering a legendary service.

Debating the budget of the Public Service and Administration is actually
talking about the tool that the department has to achieve the twin
objectives alluded to. It takes informed and responsible leaders and
citizens to appreciate the challenges with which the Department of the
Public Service and Administration is confronted. We note, with
appreciation, that faced with practical challenges, the department
introduced informed, observable and realistic interventions, such as
striving for a balance between personnel and nonpersonnel expenditure,
searching for a demands-based deployment of human resources, as well as
boosting efficiency and effectiveness through alternative service delivery
mechanisms.

What the personnel expenditure review advocates is that we should reduce
the expenditure on personnel, so that we can have enough money for capital
programmes. It is in answering this question that we talk of an objective
realignment, with an express purpose that the impact does not compromise
our mission for a better service for all.
Our President said, on 25 June 1999, that there should be a downward
management of personnel expenditure to facilitate greater spending on
improving the quality of life of the poor. Expressing the same sentiments
in his parliamentary opening speech on 4 February 2000, he indicated that
such will be achieved by rightsizing the Public Service. In his Budget
Speech, the Minister of Finance also said that personnel expenditure had
grown strongly since 1995, and that from this financial year, the
proportion of total spending that goes to personnel has begun to decline.

Statistically speaking, our Public Service is within the internationally
bearable parameters. The only problem, though, is the fact that some of the
public servants were randomly deployed during the apartheid era, when
patronage was the overarching value for securing a job in the Public
Service.

The impact is the inherent problem that manifests itself through the
existence of employees outside the Public Service establishment, adding to
the load of challenges that the department already faces. In dealing with
this particular challenge, several options become available, such as the
department's training and redeployment interventions.

It takes informed and responsible leaders and citizens to recognise that
the transformation agenda is not a single-item issue, stuck on the desire
to retrench people from work, as the proponents of impoverishment will
shout and scream that we do so indiscriminately. Instead, it is a broad-
based intervention designed to ensure efficiency in service delivery. It
also offers a management tool, in case retrenchments become inevitable, so
that people are not left destitute in the process.

We appreciate the department's move towards a policy on alternative service
delivery mechanisms. This involves a more focused approach to strategic
core functions, while the noncore functions are either outsourced, shared
or handled in partnership with other agencies or the private sector. We, as
the ANC-led Government, have said that we need a lean and efficient Public
Service. Alternative service delivery mechanisms will usher us towards this
essential goal while guaranteeing that for the first time in the history of
South Africa, we shall have a service which has been devolved to the rural
areas.

I recently led a delegation of the Portfolio Committee on the Public
Service and Administration on a visit to the Northern Province and the
Northern Cape. As a result of my experiences on these visits, I can confirm
that the broader Public Service transformation objectives are realisable.
The Roodepan one-stop shop in the Northern Cape serves as a good example of
co-ordinating services for easy access by communities. In this set-up the
provincial government, local government and parastatals render services
under one roof which are co-ordinated by an official in the premier's
office. So, one has such functions such as electricity vending, processing
of applications for birth certificates and identity documents, social
advisory services, etc. The list is endless.

I know that those doubting Thomases swelling the ranks of the DP will shout
and scream that the alternative service delivery mechanisms will not work
and they will continue to say that what we are saying is just noise. This
confirms that, indeed, it takes informed and responsible leaders and
citizens to recognise that we are not stuck in transitional challenges. We
have a workable solution.

I wish the Northern Cape provincial government would invite the hon the
leader of the largest minority party to the launch, in May this year, of
the Galeshewe one-stop shop so that he could wake up to what we mean when
we say that we are taking services to the people. The people of the
Northern Province are currently witnessing the impact of outsourcing the
functions of road infrastructure construction and maintenance through the
establishment of the Provincial Roads Agency. Despite problems related to
the registration of the agency, which I believe the Department of the
Public Service and Administration will address soon, and the effect of the
devastating floods, the agency is making commendable progress.

The ANC supports the budget of the Department of the Public Service and
Administration. [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mr Chairperson, someone once said: For that which
we do or for that which we neglect to do, those who come after us have the
right to ask account of us. We who live now carry the responsibility to
work tirelessly to create a society in which the initiatives of the
entrepreneur, the dreams and aspirations of the student and the plight of
the poor and the destitute will be met in a country in which many years
were lost on the road to becoming one nation.

Elke voorheen agtergeblewene of elke voorheen bevoorregte wat nou bereid is
om saam aan een nuwe Suid-Afrika te bou, moet die reg hê om deel te neem en
daartoe aangemoedig word. Kennis en ondervinding, asook aspirasie en
realiteit, moet saamgesnoer word om 'n Suid-Afrika te ontwikkel waarin die
verskeidenheid 'n eenheid sal word om die uitdagings van môre die hoof te
bied. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Every previously disadvantaged person or every previously advantaged
person who is now prepared to build a new South Africa together, must have
the right to participate and must be encouraged to do so. Knowledge and
experience, as well as aspirations and reality, must be combined to develop
a South Africa in which the diversity will become a unity, to overcome the
challenges of tomorrow.]

I believe that it was with this in mind that President Mandela appointed
the Presidential Review Commission to investigate Government and to
recommend measures designed to ensure that the process of reform and the
vision that drives it are built into the governance of South Africa at a
very high level.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEE: Order! Hon members in the cross
benches, you are not allowed to speak to any members in the House. If you
want to speak to them, please leave the Chamber and you can do so outside.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mr Chairperson, what is it that the Government has
to achieve in the process of creating a new culture of governance? I
believe it is good that we stop and remind ourselves, from time to time, of
what these aims are.

We must ask ourselves if the programmes which are being implemented are
helping to protect and enhance representative and participatory democracy;
to support civil society and its interaction with government; to promote
economic and social development and the advancement and empowerment of
disadvantaged people and communities; to shift power and authority from
central Government to provincial and local government within the framework
of national norms, standards and values; to locate responsibility for
achieving efficient and effective delivery of services to the lowest
possible level; to ensure that ethical and professional standards are
developed and maintained throughout the Public Service and all other organs
of state; to ensure that the functions and records of Government are open
to public view and appraisal; to ensure accountable and transparent
stewardship of public resources, so as to build the kind of society
envisaged in the Constitution; and, lastly, to reward achievements,
acknowledge failure, and give redress to grievances.

With this in mind, we in the New NP are pleased that the Department of the
Public Service and Administration and the Public Service Commission have
commenced management audits and investigations into priority departments.
We welcome the major anticorruption clean-up that is currently under way in
the Department of Correctional Services.

We believe that heads of departments cannot be allowed to run their
departments as their own private enterprises, as has happened in the
Department of Correctional Services and, previously, in the Department of
Home Affairs. The New NP condemns this kind of criminality and flagrant
abuse of power. We are looking forward to receiving a full report from the
department and the commission and we hope that criminal and disciplinary
prosecutions will come out of this process.

Now that the Public Service management framework and the Public Finance
Management Act are in place, the roles and responsibilities of directors-
general and other heads of department are very clear. With proper
vigilance, such abuses can be picked up and dealt with by Government and
Parliament. From the first of this month all heads of departments may be
held personally liable as accounting officers for unauthorised, irregular
and fruitless expenditure in terms of the Public Finance Management Act.
New systems for tracking the spending of departments on a quarterly and
even a monthly basis are being implemented by the Departments of Finance
and of State Expenditure.

The Public Service regulations require all heads of departments to be
appointed on contract and they must sign performance agreements with their
Ministers and MECs. However, this requires Ministers and MECs to evaluate
their directors-general on a regular basis and, unfortunately, in practice,
this is not happening. This is a very serious matter, and we have raised
our concerns in the portfolio committee. We were subsequently given
assurance by the Director-General of the Office of the Public Service
Commission that the commission is assuming responsibility for this area.

The agreement between the Minister or MEC and the head of department is
critical, as it is the basis for subsequent agreements between the head of
department and members of senior management in every department. The
quality of this one agreement determines the performance level of the
entire department. This kind of emphasis on performance, together with
proper systems and controls, can assist in swiftly identifying and dealing
with directors-general who are dishonest and do not perform.

I would like to agree with the chairperson of the portfolio committee about
the high quality of the reports of the Public Service Commission and their
importance in keeping Parliament informed about the performance of the
Public Service. I say well done to the professor. The recent report on
annual reporting is a harsh indictment of the inadequacy of the annual
reports that the departments are submitting to Parliament. The commission
states that our departments' reports fall way below international best
practice and that the quality of information is poor.
These annual reports are descriptions of activities rather than reports on
performance and results. I spoke earlier of the Public Service and public
finance frameworks, and of annual reporting, which is one of the areas in
which the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service
and Administration must also play a role in determining a standardised
reporting framework for departments, one that will assist us, in
Parliament, to perform our oversight role.

I understand from the annual report of the Public Service Commission that
the commission has almost completed an assets register for managers in the
Public Service. We see this as a very positive development and hope that
the register will be published soon. We would like to see some of the other
resolutions of the anticorruption conference getting urgent attention,
including the establishment of anticorruption hot lines and the
strengthening and possible consolidation of the various anticorruption
structures.

We are looking forward to the commission's forthcoming report on the
implementation of Batho Pele service delivery. We believe that for the best
results this policy must become part of the operational procedure of
service delivery points everywhere in the Public Service. Consultation
remains the cornerstone of successful implementation and improved service
delivery.

On a recent portfolio committee study visit to the Eastern Cape, the
reality showed that this province is falling apart when it comes to service
delivery. For example, there are clinics which lack adequate equipment and
medicine, a welfare department that is totally dysfunctional, and a roads
department that pays its employees but cannot provide them with a day's
work owing to a lack of funding for projects and road maintenance. There
are other provinces where similar problems occur. In July last year, the
hon the Minister for the Public Service and Administration started
prioritising capacity-building for all public servants.

The relaunch of Samdi as a training provider focusing on the management
echelon is a promising step. The fact that President Mbeki has asked Samdi
to create structured interventions for directors-general is an indication
of the confidence that is placed in the new director-general, Job Mokgoro.
At the same time, we are concerned that the approach that the Department of
the Public Service and Administration is taking in developing strategy for
human resource development is not yet coherent or co-ordinated. Transversal
human resource skills shortages or problems of large numbers of unskilled
workers should be the strategic focus of the Department of the Public
Service and Administration. In addition, there still does not seem to be
finality regarding the future policy direction of Samdi, in particular
whether it will phase in cost recovery. These matters should be resolved as
soon as possible.

Yesterday, the portfolio committee was briefed by the State Information
Technology Agency, Sita. We were pleased to see that Sita is overcoming
some of the initial problems it had to deal with in terms of the
integration of formerly separate components. Sita's business plan for the
short, medium and long term is very ambitious. Perhaps it is a little bit
too ambitious. However, it is the product of careful strategic thinking,
and we applaud the work that has been done by Sita up until now. The next
step of drafting operational plans to tackle the individual aspects of the
broader plan is critical.

In conclusion, the New NP agrees with Sita that we can all be part of the
process to make the Public Service work for South Africa. I would like to
quote from a book written by Yuda Tuval entitled Against the Flow: A New
Strategic Framework for Business Success in the 21st century.

Mr D H M GIBSON: You want to go with the flow.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: No, you cannot even go with the flow.
[Interjections.]

I quote:


  We believe that there are as many futures as your imagination will allow.
  They fall, almost invariably, into one of three categories. The first is
  more of the same ...

More of the same, like the DP -


  ... the same game played according to the same rules - and if you opt for
  this option, you will in due course become a victim. Then there is a
  second category in which you manage, to some extent, to change the rules
  of the game. By being a skilful adaptor, you can influence these futures
  and prosper in the process. Finally, by changing the game itself, by
  creating a discontinuity that you are out on your own, playing a new game
  according to new rules, you can be a shaper, capable of turning your
  vision into reality.

We, in the New NP, believe that our role as a constructive opposition will
make us part of the process of turning vision into reality. We will support
the Vote. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Chairperson, hon Minister, comrades, colleagues, hon
members, Adam Lebor wrote in the Sunday Independent of 9 April this year
about research done by a Hungarian institute, the Association of Law
Enforcement. It found that if one was a Budapest motorist pulled over for a
spot fine or if one was one of the city's ``bigs'', one could, with
confidence, bribe one's way out. A list published showed that a favour from
a police officer with Ministry contacts cost about 15 million forints. that
is approximately R370 000, but that a nod and wink from a lower-ranking
officer could cost a mere 25 000 forints.

Our public sector in South Africa has been no different. We come from a
public sector geared to meet the needs of a minority of citizens in this
country, one that denied people access to services, one which duplicated
administrations into so-called population groups. We have only to remind
ourselves of the Department of Coloured Affairs in Cape Town.

As new policies have been and are being put into place, our challenge
remains to overcome the legacy of the past. The following emerged at a
recent international conference on the public service in Hong Kong which I
attended. In South Asia there has been a notable decline in the quality of
the large state bureaucracies of this region. Here, ``the public has come
to believe that corruption in the public service is a way of life'' and
public trust in government has been greatly weakened as a result.

In Latin America most people consider most of the public bureaucracies in
the region as a malady that has no cure, despite recent efforts at
administrative reform associated with the transition from authoritarian to
democratic regimes. In fact, a recent official report released by a special
commission of the Brazilian federal government concluded:


  ... the organisational condition of the federal government and the public
  sector as a whole is grave ... society is impatient and impotent before
  the incapacity of the majority of our administrative systems to respond
  to its needs, and the public servants are demotivated and paralysed by
  the majority of the organisational systems to which they are tied, both
  in terms of poor professional opportunities and conditions of work they
  provide, as well as the irrelevancy of their actions to satisfy the
  aspirations of the social sectors they serve.

At the same conference South Africa stood out as having moved very fast on
reform in the Public Service. As a further tool for transformation in South
Africa, the current status of labour relations and the future thereof must
be safeguarded by our policy in section 5.10.5 of the Reconstruction and
Development Programme, which calls for a sound labour relations philosophy,
policy and practice for the requirement of building a motivated and
committed cadre of personnel with a very clear vision of developmental
goals.

Our policy in the RDP calls for a labour relations policy that is
accelerated in terms of dealing with corruption and mismanagement, but
clearly permits the participation of public-sector workers and their
organisations in decision-making at various levels in the sector. Strategic
choices in labour relations should be driven by efficient and effective
delivery without losing sight of getting services to those communities
which never had services in South Africa before; and the partnerships with
all stakeholders should culminate in there being joint responsibility for
implementation.

The department has been going through an exercise of scrutinising the
demographics of the Public Service, in particular the personnel and
expenditure review. The information given to us reveals that there is a
skewed skills distribution in the Public Service. The department, together
with the labour movements, should be congratulated on undertaking such an
exercise, rather than listening to those who have an appetite for throwing
workers on the street at any cost.

Government has intervened during the past four years to reduce the wage gap
between high and low income workers, and between males and females.
However, it is clear that the year-on-year negotiations will not be able to
address all these issues. It is to be commended, therefore, that Government
and labour have started the process of devising a wage policy. Such a wage
policy should be guided and set by what the RDP calls for in section
5.10.3. Firstly, it says we should have staff policies. Secondly, we should
have skills for subsectors. Thirdly, we should expand employment where it
is required - not on the street. Fourthly, we should have service delivery.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, address the whole
House in your speech and do not point to any particular member or any
particular party in the House.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: I apologise to you, Chairperson. Fifthly, we should
narrow the apartheid income gap and, sixthly, have career paths and
training. Those administrative government institutions, parastatals and
public corporations would then do so with the skill of serving the nation,
caring for the sick, upholding the Constitution, education the nation and
ending illiteracy, and, of course, with the skill to spend Government
funding in the correct manner.

Currently, the proliferation of benefits is very difficult to administer
with regard to medical aid and housing loans. This should be safely placed
in the collective buying power of the Public Service, rather than medical
aid and housing loans being entered into on an individual basis. Year-on-
year wage negotiations have been dogged by a considerable amount of
controversy, and as we move forward it would be advisable to review
negotiations continually.

Currently, the Vote on the improvement of conditions of service has been
done away with. This means that there is no longer a single identifiable
amount. Rather, it is included in each Vote of each department as a
transfer payment. Whilst this may solve the problem of accountability in
respect of accounting officers, recent provincial visits the committee has
made to the Public Service no doubt point out that the departments in the
provinces do not have the capacity to perform the tasks now expected of
them. The Department of the Public Service and Administration, therefore,
should continue to provide the support needed in these areas to build
capacity.

With regard to the splitting of the amounts and the decentralisation of the
Vote, again, during provincial visits to the departments, discomfort has
been displayed in this area. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether
negotiations are being advanced by placing an inflexible offer on the
negotiation table and also whether this would lead to the unintended
consequence of decentralising collective bargaining.

The devolving of authority to local institutions, for example hospitals,
would assist problem solving at the local level. It would assist in
effective service delivery and, of course, it would assist in democratising
at the local level. However, decentralising the improvement of conditions
of service, I trust, would not undermine collective bargaining. Centralised
bargaining provides Government with a tool for bringing about equity and
cohesion in service delivery.

Prof Pradeep Saxena of the University of Rajasthan, India, argues this
point:


  In a centrally planned economy, administrative decentralisation and
  deconcentration is a vital issue of administrative reforms.
  Decentralisation in developing economies is generally considered a
  synonym of corruption, inefficiency and discretion. Therefore,
  decentralisation is avoided and done with great care and caution. For
  example, state governments have not been authorised to clear foreign
  direct-investment proposals. After a long time, state governments were
  authorised to clear such proposals in the power (electricity) sector only
  at their own levels, but such clearances will be subjected to the final
  clearances of the central government and the State Electricity Board
  Regulatory Authority. A very thoughtful exercise is needed to
  deconcentrate administrative structures as there are practical and human
  problems involving several complex situations in the deconcentration
  processes.

Transformation in the public sector is a long process. I therefore want to
use the opportunity to congratulate the Northern Cape province, under the
leadership of the hon the premier, Manne Dipico, on introducing a one-stop
shop, a service for all Government service providers under one roof, in
Roodepan, and on the forthcoming one they are going to launch in Galeshewe,
which is much needed in that area. The project also involves the community
in shaping the project, and roots out nondelivery.

Lastly, I want to congratulate the Congress of South African Trade Unions
on the recent Public Service conference which they held on 24 March. They
committed their members to rooting out corruption, improving service
delivery and transforming the state. This commitment will certainly
accelerate a lasting partnership with society and Government. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Mr Chairperson, a government is judged by the public
servants it employs. If the officers and employees are not committed to the
cause, then the government will not only show, but will fall apart at the
earliest whirlwind.

South Africa launched the Batho Pele programme in an effort to raise the
level of services to the people. This, however, is construed as having to
serve the inner circle of relatives, comrades and buddies first. Reminders
bandied about even by some hon members of this House, that the majority
party has an overwhelming mandate are interpreted by public servants as
meaning that they should serve ``batho'' of the majority party first and
foremost. This becomes obvious, even in the appointment of the public
servants.

The Public Service Commission Act will have to be revisited. The
commissioners are supposed to be neutral. It is unbecoming to have a
commissioner who is a public servant at the same time. How can such a
person be the referee whilst he is in the field of play himself? Let us
have ``batho'' appointed, not ourselves.

The state of the nation address of 4 February 2000 still rings clearly in
my ears. Among other things, the President said that there would be
training in management and financial administration. We are grateful that
the situation has been beefed up with the appointment of a director-
general. What remains is for Government departments to use the state
institution for training their service officers.

There are managers of departments who desist from using other institutions
and leave some things unused. Such practices indicate disloyalty to our own
administration. For the Public Service to prosper, the Government must be
concerned about delivery to the people on the ground. [Time expired.]

Mr B MTHEMBU: Chairperson, hon members, the transformation of the Public
Service is not only on course, but also equally importantly, unstoppable.
There is a great revolution that is taking place, especially with the
passing of two pieces of legislation that have put in place a legal
framework for a fundamental transformation of the Public Service.

It is important that we should locate this within the mandate that has been
given to the Department of the Public Service and Administration. The
Constitution of 1996 articulates unambiguous values, principles and
requirements that must direct the management of Public Service delivery. In
order to meet the constitutional requirements of the 1996 constitutional
provisions, the Minister for the Public Service and Administration amended
the Public Service Act of 1994 through a series of Acts from 1997 up to and
including 1999.

This set of Acts and collective agreements reached in the bargaining
process constitute what is known as the Public Service management
framework, which came into effect on 1 July 1999 following the promulgation
of the Public Service regulation. To complement the Public Service
management framework, the Department of Finance passed the Public Finance
Management Act in 1999, which became operative from 1 April 2000, which
means that it is almost one and half months old. These two pieces of
legislation constitute a fundamental change, which is sometimes called a
paradigm shift, from the old public administration paradigm to an emerging
management paradigm which is in line with the emerging management paradigm
within the global environment.

South Africa, after a long period of isolation, is now trying to get itself
located within this global environment. That is what constitutes this
change. But I think the meaning and the purpose of transformation of the
Public Service can best be understood if it is viewed from an historical
perspective.

A comparative analysis of the underlying values of the Public Service and
administration and the new emerging public management paradigm is very
instructive. Firstly, there is the principle of accountability to all the
people of South Africa, through their democratically elected
representatives in the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures,
in contrast with the old public administration which was secretive, opaque
and accountable to a secretive security system, from the top to the local
government level. The public administration was integrated into military
intelligence structures in the form of joint management committees
accountable to the powerful national security management system. It was not
accountable to the legislatures, let alone the public, whom it was supposed
to serve.

Another key principle is representivity, as opposed to the old public
administration which was founded on a caste system. Hence its bureaucracy
was dominated by the minority of white males, generally conservative,
Afrikaans-speaking, and sometimes labelled Christian. I wish to direct this
to the attention of the hon Mr Grobler, who says that it is not procedural
to make a breakdown of whether we are making progress in restructuring
representivity of the Public Service. The point is that we are carrying out
our mandate of making the Public Service representative. We need to monitor
and to know precisely whether we are making progress. We do not have to
hide behind humankind. We need to make progress, because we do not need a
state of affairs in which we have only a certain sector represented. We are
making progress on that course.

The Public Service management framework and the Public Finance Management
Act are very critical, and I think that it is important to point out the
key features, because these are very important. Key to this legal framework
is the question of accountability, managerial authority, customer service,
and performance management. Accountability is very crucial, because
Government is there to serve the people. The Public Service management
framework makes provision for elected and unelected office bearers to be
more accountable. As from now power has been devolved to the executive
authorities - that is MECs and the Ministers - to make policies that are
content-specific for their departments. We are no longer going to have
Ministers saying that heads of department are not delivering, when in fact
they are not giving directives.

In terms of this Act, one has to make policies in terms of human resources
and organisational structure, and then give direction. In other words the
authorities have to put clear, well-projected outcomes on the table, and
this will make them more accountable. The hon member who is speaking over
there must know that we had a situation at the height of apartheid where a
certain Minister built hundreds of toilets in the veld. There was no
accountability for the hundreds of toilets in the veld. The Minister said:
``I do not know. It is the fault of the directors-general.'' In turn, the
directors-general blamed the Minister. No one took responsibility.

We want MECs and Ministers who will be accountable, and this is the
provision of this Act. Furthermore, in terms of the Public Finance
Management Act, the heads of departments will be accounting officers who
will be responsible for delivery. We now have a complex approach which,
unfortunately, our friends do not understand. This is a complex approach
which intends to make managers effective. As our President said: ``Managers
must manage.'' For managers to manage, they must be given authority, but
this authority must be controlled. So we now have an approach which will
give the centre control without stifling flexibility, and that is the
intention of this Act.

That is not the only issue. Another important provision is that those who
are misusing funds will either be put in jail for not more than five years,
or they will be fined. It is important to point out that this important
piece of legislation only came into existence in 1999, almost nine months
ago. And the other Act is only one and a half weeks old. It would be
unrealistic for people, when we have all the instruments in place, to jump
to conclusions and say that we are not delivering. The fact of the matter
is that this is a constitutional democracy and we have to put in place
instruments. The instruments are there: what is important is for us it to
put them into practice. I am happy to report that on the recent visits to
the provinces, we saw that these issues are being implemented. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Chairperson, hon members, I would like to take this
opportunity to pay tribute to those officials in the Public Service whose
dedication, hard work and integrity has contributed to the upliftment of
South Africa's people and to the development of South Africa as a whole.
The department is tasked with a huge responsibility of providing quality
service to the people of our country, and especially to the poor, who have
for so long being deprived by the New NP of a decent standard of living. It
is understandable and, indeed, desirable that the department is concerned
with the improvement of the conditions of service.

Unfortunately, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. So the road
to service delivery in South Africa is paved with corrupt officials, a
Government unwilling to put the people before its politicians, and
legislation that restricts quality service rather than provides it.
Unfortunately, when we take a closer look, we see a department shackled by
the ill-conceived and impractical policies and practices of the rest of the
Government.

It is indeed ironic that South Africa's labour laws add a considerable
burden to the Public Service, ensuring that the people, the poor, continue
to suffer. We have arrived at a point where the Labour Relations Act makes
it so costly and so difficult for departments to dismiss officials guilty
of misconduct that it is often cheaper to offer massive golden handshakes
or simply to retain these people.

We need only look at the cases of James Nkambule and Sibongile Sithole in
Mpumalanga. Mr Nkambule, a self-confessed fraudster, demanded R867 000 as a
severence package after being dismissed. Three weeks later, he had his job
back because procedures of the Labour Relations Act were not followed. It
is shocking. Even more shocking is that Miss Sithole, who was responsible
for the scandal involving matric results, has walked away with R2,6
million. It is seen to be the cheaper option for Government - R2,6 million
for a corrupt official. It would appear, further, that it pays to be
corrupt and that it is too expensive to hold officials accountable.

When the time comes to implement the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,
overtime costs in the Public Service will increase dramatically. This is
astounding, considering that the Public Service Commission already puts the
figure at R1 billion a year - R1 billion that belongs to the poor of this
country. No wonder that the state has very little left with which to
deliver. I repeat that it is the people, the poor, who continue to suffer.

When it comes to priorities, delivery capacity has taken a distant second
to affirmative action. Government is so preoccupied by colour that there is
little time left for questions of qualification, experience and dedication.
[Interjections.] This is how that an official without matric became
Mpumalanga's head of the anticorruption unit. The fact that he worked for
other Government agencies with false qualifications prior to coming to
Mpumalanga and the fact that MEC Modipane does not see any need to see why
and how this happened, is simply shocking.
The ANC Government's response to corruption merely serves to fuel the
situation. Let us take the example of Premier Mahlangu in Mpumalanga. He
has done everything in his power to prevent commissions of inquiry into
corruption from completing their work. He has tried to stop at least two
inquiries involving district councils and he has delayed the release of
another commission's report. When his local government MEC, Fish Mahlalela,
attempted to continue with investigations ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! On what point to you rise,
sir?

Mr D M GUMEDE: Chairperson, I would like to know whether I can ask the
member a question about corruption.

Mr M L DA CAMARA: No. [Interjections.] When MEC Mahlalela was only hours
away from passing his findings on to the National Director of Public
Prosecution's office, he was fired. There he goes. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mnu B R MKHIZE: Sihlalo namalungu ePhalamende, ngiyanibingelela. Namhlanje
ngimema wonke amanye amaqembu alapha ePhalamende ukuba abambisane
noHulumeni kaKhongolose kumkhankaso wethu wempilo engcono kuwonke-wonke.

Angazi-ke ukuthi, umhlonishwa lo oqeda ukusuka lapha, ngabe wazini
ngamalungelo abantu kanye nokuthi futhi wazini ngabantu abahluphekayo ngoba
bayasivimba kuyo yonke into esifuna ukuyenza lapha. Zonke izichibiyelo
zomthetho abazifuni. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr B R MKHIZE: Chairperson, I take pleasure in saluting all members of
Parliament. I would like to invite all political parties to work together
with the ANC on its campaign to create a better life for all.

I doubt if the hon member who was here just now knows anything about
people's rights. I am also not sure if he knows anything about people who
live in abject poverty. Usually he and his party oppose everything that we
want to do. They oppose all legislative amendments.]

Many reports tell us that we do not have a bloated Public Service and we
are happy about that. However, public servants are, generally speaking,
underskilled. Many public servants lack the skills and competencies which
would allow them to be more usefully employed in their departments or
perhaps in other departments or in another location. At the same time, we
can no longer afford to have skewed numbers of public servants. The answer
to the matter cannot be training, but some strategies should be considered,
such as redeployment to other areas.

All departments at national and provincial levels have been required to
draw up a human resource plans, which will identify which public servants
need to learn new skills and competencies, which must be moved to a
different location, and which must be given the choice to move or be
retrenched. However, the issue of retrenchment is a last resort. The
purpose of the human resource plan is primarily to identify skills
shortages, incidents of overstaffing and understaffing where these exist,
to develop training interventions to address skills shortages and to
develop recruitment strategies for bringing in new people.

I am very pleased to announce that the Minister appointed Mr Job Mokgoro as
the Director-General of the SA Management Development Institute at the end
of last year. We congratulate him.

Sithi halala Mnumzane. Siyabonga. [Ihlombe.] [We say congratulations, sir!
Thank you. [Applause.]]

The main focus of Samdi remains management development, but the institute
has been re-engineered to deliver training intervention that supports the
policy determinations of the Minister and the Department of the Public
Service and Administration, in particular with regard to the implementation
of the new Public Service management framework.

The broader policy questions regarding Samdi still have to be resolved. An
example of this is whether Samdi is going to move towards cost recovery and
commercialisation, and if so, in what timeframe. One of the new areas of
focus for Samdi is organisational development. Samdi also has an important
role in facilitating the EU-funded Joint Universities Training and
Education Trust programme. A key area of responsibility that has been
identified for Samdi recently is capacity-building for director-generals,
assigned by the President, following a meeting of the forum of South
African directors-general last year.

Samdi experienced some organisational problems during 1999-2000, but the
organisation played a very critical role in developing and improving the
management skills in the Public Service. Samdi managed to train about 9 500
public servants between March 1999 and March 2000.

Lowaya Mnumzane akalalele lokhu futhi. [The hon member over there must
listen to this again.]

Samdi has and still continues to train and develop senior managers. In
addition to that, 205 senior managers were trained by Samdi during 1999.

I am very keen to highlight the fact that there have been some problems
with the implementation of the White Paper in line with the Skills
Development Act and the Skills Development Levies Act of the Department of
Labour, because the labour legislation requires that sectoral education and
training authorities must be established, but does not allow dual
membership, for example, of a Public Service sectoral authority and another
sector such as health. The Public Service incorporates several factors.
This question must be resolved soon, as 25 sectoral educational and
training authorities were launched in March last year by the Minister of
Labour.

I am also pleased to inform the House that Samdi offers training
intervention for managers, either on its own or in partnership with several
tertiary institutions in South Africa, such as universities. The Department
of the Public Service and Administration is responsible for the
implementation of key aspects of the White Paper, in particular satisfying
the requirements of the Minister of Labour as set out in the Skills
Development Act and the Skills Development Levies Act.

However, the training of public servants, especially at the levels below
middle management, is the responsibility of the line managers in each and
every department. We must not forget that perhaps in the past there has
been a shift of responsibility from one person to the next and now, with
the new regulations, it is clear that it is an aspect of line management,
such as performance management or the maintenance of discipline. It is
managers and ultimately the heads of departments who must be held
accountable for capacity-building. In conclusion, the Department of the
Public Service and Administration must produce an integrated strategy and
facilitate the establishment of an institutional framework and
infrastructure. Samdi must train managers and managers must be responsible
for the career development of the officials under their supervision.

Kubafowethu, ngithi uHulumeni oholwa yi-ANC akangabazi ukufuna ukwazi
ukuthi yini eqhubekayo mayelana nezinguquko ukuze kuguqulwe izinto esimweni
sezemisebenzi. Ngalokho ngithi-ke kuyangimangaza namhlanje ukuzwa ilungu
elihloniphekile le-DP lithi kukhona abantu abayi-dead wood. Angazi-ke
ukuthi ngingathini ngesiZulu uma ngisho i-dead wood ngoba abantu abafile
ngeke umuntu ababone behamba lapha.

Uma ngabe i-DP izophikisana nayo yonke inqubekela-phambili yokwenza ngcono
impilo kawonke-wonke lapha eNingizimu Afrika, abantu balapha eNingizimu
Afrika bazoyibiza ngokuthi ingama-dead wood alapha ngaphakathi ePhalamende.
Baphikisana cishe nazo zonke izichibiyelo zemithetho emisha yokwenza ngcono
impilo yabantu. Yazini-ke namhlanje i-DP nge-human race? Uma namhlanje i-DP
ingaphupha, iphuphe umbuso iwuphethe, kungathomba ukhiye kubheke le ngoba i-
DP ayinalutho esandleni lokubusa izwe. Umuntu angabona kahle uma nje oTony
Leon kungasa kusasa nje ngephupho, bephethe umbuso. Kungaqhaqhazela
amabhulukwe, kuqhaqhazele yonke into ngoba ayikho into abayiphethe
esandleni yokwenza ngcono impilo yabantu. [Ihlombe.] Uma umuntu engayibheka
kahle i-DP, angathola ukuthi ayibandi futhi ayishisi, intukuntuku nje.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to say to our brothers that the ANC-led Government is
confident. It wants to know what is being done to change the employment
situation. Therefore, I am perturbed to hear the hon member of the DP
saying that there are people whom he refers to as ``dead wood''. I cannot
translate this into Zulu, because if he means dead people, people who are
dead are not visible.

If the DP is going to oppose any progressive attempt to improve the lives
of all South Africans, the people of this country will call it
``parliamentary dead wood party''. The DP seems to oppose almost all
legislative amendments aimed at improving the lives of our people. What
does the DP know about the human race? Even if the DP can imagine itself in
power, I am sure if this happened there would be a problem because it has
no vision to rule this country. Outrageous things can happen, for instance,
if the hon Tony Leon becomes the president of South Africa tomorrow. His
legs will tremble in his trousers. Everything will tremble, because the DP
has no plan to improve the lives of the people of this country. [Applause.]
When one watches the DP closely, one finds that it is neither hot nor cold,
it is lukewarm. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr B R MKHIZE: Sengisalelwe yiminithi namasekhendi ayi-30 kuphela. [I only
have one minute and thirty seconds left.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, please come back
to the topic. [Laughter.]

Mr B R MKHIZE: Oh, OK.

I-DP, uma umuntu eyibheka kahle ngempela, isekulesiya simo sakudala
sobandlululo ngokwengqondo lapha ekhanda. Uhulumeni wobandlululo
wawungawazi amalungelo abantu. Khona manje, uma singenza isichibiyelo
sokusebenza komthetho wezakhiwo zokusiza abantu bakaHulumeni, i-DP ingathi
vinini ngejubane isiya kumaphephandaba.

Ngifuna ukwazi namhlanje futhi ngifuna i-DP itshele abantu ukuthi ngabe
uHulumeni wayo ubuswa ngamaphephandaba yini? Qha, into okufanele yenziwe yi-
DP ngukuthi yazi namhlanje ukuthi noma iyathanda noma ayithandi uMnyango
wezemiSebenzi yemiPhakathi sizowuguqula futhi impilo yabantu sizoyenza
ngcono. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

In fact there is no doubt that psychologically the DP is still living in
the apartheid era. The apartheid regime did not know anything about human
rights. If we try to amend the law regarding buildings that will assist
Government employees, the DP will run to the media.

I want to know today whether the DP is led by newspapers. No, from now on
the DP must know that the Department of Public Works will definitely amend
this law and that we will improve the lives of our people. [Applause.]]

Mr S SIMMONS: Chairperson, hon Minister and members, it is the role of the
opposition to hold the Government accountable for its failures, expose
inefficiencies and systematic breakdowns where these exist and put forward
sensible and practical alternatives. The question to the hon the Minister
is: How successful was the Government in delivering an efficient and
quality service to the citizens of South Africa over the past financial
year?

In some instances the Government had success, but in many cases the
services rendered ranged from poor to putrid. The facts speak for
themselves. Between 1994 and the end of 1999 more than one million jobs
were abolished, pushing unemployment up to a dangerous 30% and thereby
increasing and aggravating the poverty position in the country. In the
Eastern Cape alone, the unemployment rate is 54%.

Secondly, according to the recent Public Service Commission report,
insufficient Public Service managers and unwieldy disciplinary procedures
were blamed for the fact that misconduct cases nearly quadrupled since
1996, that is from 305 to 1 113, an increase of 264%. Of even more concern,
according to the report, was the long delay in finalising misconduct cases.
Of the 2 247 cases reported since 1996, only 1 077, less than 50%, have
been finalised.

Thirdly, according to a recent Auditor-General's report, it was found that
huge underspending of poverty relief funds to the amount of R293 million
occurred, punishing innocent, poverty-stricken South Africans through
negligence on the part of the officials. Owing to problems of capacity and
skill which resulted in poor planning and management, the Department of
Welfare recently included nonexistent projects in a list of recipients to
be awarded R203 million for poverty relief, according to the Independent
Development Trust.

According to a recent report, the state could be liable for millions of
rands in claims for damage, because hundreds of prisoners are being
detained unlawfully since the Department of Correctional Services is not
delivering prisoners to courts on time.

A Public Service Commission Report on overtime payments to public servants
in all departments, tabled before the portfolio committee, indicated that
over a period of five years, that ended with the 1997-98 financial year,
the amount paid out has increased from R9 million to R956 million. The
report said that these claims had become part and parcel of many officials'
lifestyle and that control measures are inadequate and open to
manipulation.

So I could go on referring to weak service delivery, but in respect of the
following, where it mattered most, the present South African Government has
failed the South African community. Time prevents me from elaborating on
them, but they have been covered thoroughly in the press and include
education, health, welfare, the police, justice, transport and correctional
services, not to mention provincial administrations in which the ANC
governs and the corruption in the Public Service. These examples are only a
selection of the evidence presented, and it indicates that the Government
is not delivering on the fundamental task at the core of every government's
responsibility.

The New NP takes cognisance of the steps taken, besides others, to halt the
terminal decline which could have dire consequences for socioeconomic and
political stability, to put mechanisms in place to monitor service
delivery, to eradicate corruption in the Public Service and to train
officials in so far as management skills and sound financial procedures are
concerned. These steps referred to must not be lip service, but I must
really address the said shortcomings on a continuous basis.

Mrs L MALONEY: Mr Chairperson, Minister for the Public Service and
Administration, hon members, today I would like to talk about a few issues
pertaining to our Public Service Commission.

Firstly, I wish to remind this House of the vision and mission of this body
which are derived from the values and principles of the Public Service
administration, as laid down in section 195 of our Constitution of 1996.
The overall aim of this body is to promote constitutionally enshrined
democratic principles and values in the Public Service by investigating,
monitoring, evaluating, communicating and reporting on public
administration. Through research processes, it will ensure the promotion of
excellence in governance and delivery of affordable and sustainable quality
service. Its operating principles, to mention but a few, will be, firstly,
impartiality and independence in all action, and, secondly, a good working
relationship of trust and respect with all clients and stakeholders through
consultation, assessment and feedback. The co-operative governance of the
Public Service Commission is also informed from the model articulated in
the country's Constitution.

The commissioners are supported by the Office of the Public Service
Commission, whose head office is situated in Pretoria. The Director-General
of the Office of the Public Service Commission is the accounting officer
for the head office and the regional offices in the nine provinces. Our
expectation is for the Public Service Commission to maintain a high
standard of professionalism, efficient, economic and effective use of
public resources, development orientated administration, and the provision
of impartial, fair, equitable and nonbiased services, including responding
to people's needs and participating in and encouraging leaders in policy-
making. Its core business should include anticipation, accountability and
transparency.

As a member of the Portfolio Committee on the Public Service and
Administration, I wish to confirm that most of the functions I have
mentioned so far have been achieved. I also wish to mention that this
commission has a very healthy working relationship with the Department of
the Public Service and Administration. This was proved when the Public
Service Commission, together with the department, conducted a review of
management practices in the Department of Home Affairs and the
investigation currently taking place in the Department of Correctional
Services.

On the achievements of this commission, I would like to highlight some few
issues since 1999. They had embarked on the project of evaluating annual
reports as an accountability mechanism, which helped a lot to improve the
quality of reporting in the departments. The benchmarking of departments
against the key requirements of the Batho Pele White Paper and the code of
conduct workshop were successfully conducted by the commission in the
provinces. These workshops were aimed at properly directing and
strengthening the working capability of departmental managers.

Regarding reports to the National Assembly, the commission managed to
disclose discrepancies on the management of leave. The commission has
reported the discovery of other discrepancies with regard to overtime
remuneration, sick leave and disciplinary procedures at management level.
The good news is that most of these discrepancies have been corrected by
the commission. This means that a lot of taxpayers' money is being saved.

The commission's plan for the years 2000 to 2009 is for the office to set
up information technology infrastructure in all regions. The commission
will also be reporting on how the Public Service has dealt with the
question of representivity targets that were set in the White Paper on
Affirmative Action in the Public Service during the coming year. We cannot
afford a situation in which the Public Service is dominated by white males
in grey suits and shoes and wearing a uniform hairstyle. [Laughter.]

One of the key functions of the PSC in the coming year is the establishment
of regional offices of the commission. We hope that the commissioners who
were provincial nominees in the beginning will be dedicating a reasonable
amount of their time to working in the provinces, and that they will have a
clear plan on what they intend to achieve in their respective provinces.
They should also be in constant touch with the commission in Pretoria
because they are not free agents, but disciplined members of a unified
constitutional institution.

Before I conclude, I wish to quote the words of the President during his
state of the nation address. He said:


  However, I am certain that we are all inspired to act with greater vigour
  - and will indeed act with greater vigour - to achieve the fundamental
  transformation of our country, because at no point during its entire
  history has our country been in a better position to confront the
  challenges we face than it is today.

  At no other point in time have we ever been as well placed as we are
  today ...

[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Speaker, the ACDP is not very concerned about the
hairstyle of officials. [Interjections.] Instead, we are concerned about
their efficiency.

We support the budget of the department. We welcome the creation of
institutions such as Samdi and Sita. However, on behalf of Sita, I would
like to urge the department to pay the debts owed to Sita, as the director-
general requested. I am therefore using this platform to urge the
department to pay that money so that this institution can function
properly. The question I would like to ask the Sita director-general is how
he reconciles his saying that Sita is a provider of choice with his
argument that procurements by departments should be certified by Sita. I
see a contradiction in that statement.
With regard to Samdi, I would like to make the following comments.
According to reports we have received, specifically with regard to the
Eastern Cape, the Samdi programme is good but too general. They complain
that it is not relevant and specific to particular departments. I would
appreciates it if the director-general could take that into account.

I am addressing the following comments to the Minister generally. As a
member of the tour group which visited the Eastern Cape, I observed that as
much as the policies of the department are good, there are difficulties of
implementation. One of the problems is that middle management is untrained.
Training has only taken place at the top. The integrated implementation
programme has not been implemented in that province in particular, nor, I
suppose, in other provinces. The major concern from our side is the fact
that the Department of Public Works has completely collapsed and this makes
it difficult for all other departments to function effectively and to
deliver services.

Another issue that was raised was that there were indeed additional
unskilled workers. The problem is that they are unskilled and cannot be
utilised to fill certain vacancies. Vacancies that have been caused by the
departure of skilled employees are difficult to fill. That is one of the
problems, and the voluntary severance package is not working to address the
problem.

Another issue is that there is a policy discrepancy in that the definition
of overtime has not been resolved. The impression is created that overtime
refers to when one works after official hours, whereas, depending on the
nature of the job, it could be that it is the only time a particular job
can be done. That cannot be described as overtime, but at the moment people
are claiming to be doing overtime when they are working after hours, when
in fact they cannot work within office hours in those particular sectors.

Lastly, there is the problem of the devolution of powers. Some provinces
are unable to take disciplinary measures on certain issues, because they
are unsure whether they have the authority to act in those particular
instances, for example with regard to justice and land affairs, where
property belonging to the state is being looted.

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Madam Speaker, it is important to remember that, before
one says anything, one should be well informed. It is unfortunate that I
have to respond to the member Grobler. We have just undertaken a visit to
the provinces, and Mr Van Jaarsveld can bear me out. When we went to the
provinces, we all agreed that we should stop this business of sitting in
our revolving chairs in Sandton and Durban North and criticising public
servants, because we found that public servants in the provinces are
dedicated, committed and doing wonderful work. We were saying that we in
Parliament should start to motivate those public servants.

Mr Grobler went with us to Sita. After that he went home, but he tells the
House that the people in the Eastern Cape died in the queue and that this
is because of the irresponsible public servants. He was sitting in his
revolving chair in Sandton or wherever he went. [Laughter.] Secondly, he
was talking about dysfunctional electronical equipment. Sita has no control
over the equipment referred to by the hon member. He should be knowledgable
and not just go: ``Bam, bam!'' All that equipment belongs to
nonparticipating departments.

The maintenance of the equipment belonging to nonparticipating departments
is mostly outsourced to the private sector. An unfortunate point, though,
is that this equipment is linked to Government infrastructure managed by
Sita. As soon as all Government departments, provincial legislatures and
all organs of state participate in Sita the problem will be solved. Sita
cannot accept responsibility for areas not under its control. The DP is
talking about R3 million. It is true that after the portfolio committee
went there, departments paid to such an extent that Sita now is left with a
remaining debt of R2 million and there are arrangements for Sita to fix
that.

Perhaps when we talk of Sita I have to explain, for the sake of members who
were not here, that there was a reason for the Government to form Sita.
When we came here in 1994 the tendency was for managers or heads of
departments to resign and form consultancies. They came back to Government
and charged the Government exorbitant amounts of money, which was
tantamount to exploitation. That is why the Government started Sita.

Sita is ours, as we are sitting here. Sita belongs to the people out there.
Let me relate to hon members the history of Sita. The State Information
Technology Agency is a company formed in terms of the Companies Act,
through the State Information Technology Agency Act of 1998. It is an
information system facility, which is responsible for the management and
execution of information technology, information systems and related work
for, and on behalf of Government.

The motivation for the establishment of Sita received a unanimous
endorsement in the National Assembly in October 1998. In April 1999 Sita
took concrete form and commenced with its operations with one goal in mind:
To make the Government work better and cost less through information
technology and information systems, as well as to make a difference in
Public Service delivery.

The primary issues which Sita was created for and mandated to confront and
resolve are still fresh in our memories: Recruiting, developing and
retaining skills in information technology and information systems
personnel; managing information technology procurement, and ensuring that
Government gets value for money; using information technology to support
transformation and service delivery; the efficient utilisation of expensive
information technology resources; integrating information technology
initiatives; and reducing duplication, thereby saving the Government money.

Given these factors, the Sita mandate was expressed beyond any shadow of
doubt by the State Information Technology Agency Act. The mandate of Sita
provides for information technology, information systems and related
services to, or on behalf of, participating departments in regard to these
services, and to act as an agent of the South African Government.

The Portfolio Committee on the Public Service and Administration
understands Sita. Firstly, members of the portfolio committee had an
opportunity to visit Sita headquarters in Pretoria on 24 March 2000 and
were briefed on the extent of the operations of Sita by the acting managing
director, Mr Sello Mokale, who is seated there in the gallery. Seated next
to him is the ever-busy chairperson of the board of directors of Sita, Mr
Sello Rasethaba. We thank them and commend their work. They should keep up
the good work.

Secondly, the statement of strategic direction and the business plan for
Sita was presented to the portfolio committee on 12 March 2000. The
presentation was conducted with the chairperson of the board of directors
giving a report on the progress during the first year of operation, and the
acting managing director presenting the strategic direction and business
plan.

From the presentation, it was clear that the Sita management knew where
Sita was going, and what needed to be achieved in the short, medium and
long term. The vision clearly states: To become a leading and respectable
public sector information technology company in the world that provides
relevant products and services to the Government cost-effectively. It is an
employer of choice, an advance user of information technology and delivers
value for money to the shareholder. The shareholder here is Government; and
if it is Government, it is the people on the ground.

Clearly, Sita is on track, but for them to be effective, Government must
recognise Sita as a redeeming instrument at Government's disposal. This
recognition will be visible when the national and provincial departments -
and all other organs of state - begin to consider Sita as a starting point
and central frame of reference for Government's information technology
needs, information systems, policies and strategies.

Sita is ready and willing to work with departments to set standards,
respond to the needs of the departments, help consolidate infrastructure
and involve the private sector in procurement for Government requirements.
Sita was created by us here. So, I would urge the Minister to begin,
firstly, to address our own frustrations; secondly, to facilitate service
delivery; thirdly, to take government to the people; and, fourthly, to save
money and redirect it to meeting other needs, to enable us to focus on our
core business.

We are frustrating our own creation, our own instrument for effective
service delivery by allowing organs of state to do their own information
technology and information systems procurement, delaying the incorporation
of organs of state into Sita and withholding payment to Sita for services
rendered. I think we as members should know that we cannot afford to
frustrate an establishment which was founded by us for the purpose of
helping the Government by giving money to private individuals who got their
experience within Government departments, went out to establish their own
companies and came back to charge the exorbitant amounts I have mentioned.

We have not demonstrated sufficiently our resolve to make Sita work for us.
One year after its creation, only two departments, Safety and Security and
Defence, participate in the affairs of Sita, while other departments and
provincial governments are going on as if Sita did not exist. It is clear
that the time has come for the Government to revisit the State Information
Technology Agency Act to demonstrate the Government's commitment to the
ideals for which Sita was created. A delay will, no doubt, be costly.

To make Sita work, I suggest that we transfer immediately the Chief
Directorate: Centre for Applied Government Financial Management under the
Branch: Office of the Accountant-General in the Department of State
Expenditure, because it deals with that part of the department's mission
that aims to develop, implement and maintain an acceptable accounting and
reporting system, and comprises the following directorates: Financial
Software Support I, Financial Software Support II and Financial Software
Support III. This would enable Sita to appoint its own directorate, as is
the case with similar Schedule 2 entities. External auditors can be
appointed by companies such as Sita, provided this is done in agreement
with the Auditor-General. This would be preferable as it would ensure that
Sita is audited as a (Pty) Ltd company.

However, as the State Information Technology Agency Act is specific in
terms of auditing, it would override the Public Finance Management Act in
this respect. Therefore, in order to remedy this, the Act would have to be
amended in order to conform with the Public Finance Management Act, which
has just been promulgated. A possibility, however, exists that as the
Public Finance Management Act was not promulgated at the time the State
Information Technology Agency Act was passed, the state law advisers may
feel that a regulation is possible to bring it in line with the Public
Finance Management Act.

I feel that we in this Parliament must begin to force Government
departments to be incorporated into Sita's activities. There seems to be a
reluctance by state departments to integrate their IT functions with Sita.
The question is: Why? This could be for the following reasons: firstly, a
case of waiting to see whether Sita will survive and deliver what it is
supposed to deliver; secondly, not trusting another entity with noncore
business activities, namely Government information technology management;
thirdly, circumventing integration by going into long-term contracts with
private vendors that Sita may not wish to take over; and, fourthly, a lack
of clearly defined Government priorities for integration based upon the
business requirements of the Government.

Now I wish to address the restrictive nature of Sita. Concerning the
restrictive nature of the State Information Technology Agency Act, the
amendments to the Act, Act No 88 of 1998, are required to address the way
that that Act was written. Making certain changes will enhance the ability
of Sita to operate in the way it was intended to operate and to provide
solutions to Government which are aligned with the recommendations
contained in the Presidential Review Report.

In conclusion, the existence of this Government relies on the effective and
efficient Public Service delivery. Sita is here to deliver. Do members know
what Sita is proposing? Sita states that in rural areas there are schools
and police stations with electricity and all the facilities, yet there are
mjondolos [shacks] 20 km away that have no water and electricity. Sita will
prevent that by putting cables in those areas.

So I urge this House to begin to argue that all Government departments must
join Sita. The Government has the capacity to steer all departments to work
with Sita. The existence of this Government relies on effective and
efficient Public Service delivery. Sita is the information technology
vehicle which we created to facilitate the concept of Batho Pele. Sita is
asking for an honest chance to make information technology work for South
Africa. Therefore, the issues limiting Sita to operate as it should must be
removed immediately to make both Sita and the Government work.

I wish to end by saying that we ask the DP ... While we were visiting
provinces last week, we got into the KwaZulu-Natal parliament.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Madam Speaker, I was going to tell members a very
interesting story. [Interjections.] Because they are all the same.
Everywhere, they are the same. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, you may tell your story after the session.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION: Madam Speaker, I
would like to start out by just re-emphasising one or two issues, I think,
especially for the benefit of those members who participated in this debate
and clearly responded as though certain issues were never raised.

We have stated upfront, as a Government, repeatedly, whether through the
state of the nation address or in interventions by Ministers, that we are
involved in the critical process of transforming the Public Service,
improving productivity, reviewing the skills level that is there in
Government, looking at the current structure of the Public Service,
reviewing current organisations and working towards ensuring that we have a
Public Service that will indeed take forward what was raised in the Freedom
Charter, ie that ``the people shall govern''. The governance of the people
comes also through ensuring that there is accessibility to services and
that there are good quality services.

Hence, as a key issue, we do need to address performance in the Public
Service in order to ensure that we address the motivation of public
servants. I would like to thank those members who participated in this
debate, who were clearly informed and who took care to go into the detail
of issues and came out by sharing details that were quite critical for the
public. They deliberately did not look at using this House to mislead the
public.

There are, however, certain members, such as the hon Grobler, who made a
late discovery about the human race. It is like him to discover this
evident fact so late in the day. Hence, he now wakes up and wants to equate
the Government and what the Government is doing in terms of redressing
issues with the apartheid government's institutionalisation of racial
discrimination, which did this in a way that was clearly intended to create
divisions and have partisan service delivery.

The idea that the Government is now left with deadwood is a spiteful and
unwarranted attack by hon Grobler on the many civil servants who do their
work. We want to state that there is a need for us to be careful that we do
not paint all public servants with the same brush. We must acknowledge that
the programmes we have referred to are at different degrees of development,
but they are indeed going forward. We are looking at developing sustainable
solutions to the transformation project, and anyone who knows anything
about Public Service reform will tell you that if it is to be done on a
sustainable basis, it cannot be done in one day and will not be done in two
years either.

Clear progress has been made and is being measured as we go along, and I
would hence call on members to rise above their less noble instincts when
discussing issues of such importance. I also want to go further by saying
that the hon Grobler has a colleague, the hon Da Camara, who came to the
front here and clearly, as he stood here acted in line with what Brecht
raised when he spoke about the parade of the old new, saying:


  Roundabout stood such as inspired terror, shouting: ``Here comes the new.
  It is all new. Salute the new. Be new like us!'' And those who heard,
  heard nothing but their shouts, but those who saw, saw such as were not
  shouting.

I think we should distinguish between coming here, spewing and and walking
out, and then coming back and hoping that one will get limited kudos when
one comes in much later, but not caring one bit about the broader issues
being raised by other members in the House. [Interjections.] I think we
should be careful about wanting to be heard and shouting. [Interjections.]
If hon members stop shouting they will hear, but they must listen carefully
too.

I want to go forward and say: Let us look at what has been raised as issues
that are being and will be dealt with. [Interjections.] We have said that
all irregularities are being investigated, and those that are recent will
be investigated by bodies such as the Public Service Commission. The Public
Service Commission is doing an extensive audit in Mpumalanga at this point
in time, amongst other things, on the qualifications of managers. We have -
and I raised this earlier, but again it was about shouting and not
listening - indicated that we are in discussions with the Department of
Labour regarding the review of certain requirements for some of the sectors
in which service delivery requires and compels different approaches. This
is being looked at.

The Department of the Public Service and Administration will continue to
regulate the standards and norms of the Public Service, and we will
continue this into the future. I do want to say that it is not costly to
dismiss corrupt officials. What is missing - and I raised this earlier, but
members do not want to listen - is a degree of enforcement of existing
regulations by managers and heads of department. We are enforcing this
throughout the Public Service.

I want to go on to what Mr Van Jaarsveld said and say that he raised a
number of welcome issues. I think he raised them appropriately because he
is, indeed, constructive. He is not like that hon member who thinks his job
is to come and spit here. This is not what this Parliament is about.

The Public Service Commission has developed a framework for the evaluation
of heads of department. This has been circulated in Government departments.
We await comments from all executing authorities in order to implement it.
It will be implemented in this financial year, 2000-01, in which we will
evaluate performance within the context of institution-building, which is
quite critical.

In closing I want to emphasise a certain area of work that I could not
focus on in my opening input, namely the strengthening of institutional
performance. Over the past six months we have supported the provinces of
KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and the Northern Province in finalising
their management plans and in clearly identifying areas in which they
require further support. Following a request for additional support, we
launched an integrated provincial support programme and committed R25
million to support programmes aimed at enhancing efficiency and
effectiveness in these provinces.

The programme focuses on supporting key departments in these provinces and
it is being extended to Mpumalanga, the Free State and the northern
provinces. In a collaborative effort at national Government level, we are
busy conducting management audits of the National Directorate of Public
Prosecutions, the Departments of Public Works, of Justice, and of Home
Affairs. We have completed the audit of the Department of Correctional
Services and, at the moment, partnership programmes are also under way to
support the Department of Welfare in strengthening its management systems.

In total we have committed over R70 million through donor funding to the re-
engineering of programmes with the identified departments. These
collaborative programmes reflect our commitment to working with departments
in finding solutions to the challenges facing us. This is not about us just
lamenting the difficulties and pinpointing them, but about actually putting
in place programmes that will ensure effective and sustainable solutions to
problems in Government.

As we continue this work we are constantly reminded that it will take
longer to change systems that were put in place over decades and which were
aimed at delivering services to selected communities and to certain
population groups at the expense of the majority. We know that as we go
into rural communities, service delivery is being rolled out, but that it
needs to be improved upon to a large degree. Once again I would like to say
that we need to commend those hard-working and patriotic public servants
who are rolling out services on a daily basis, who have ensured that
services are extended to areas that were previously underserviced and
unserviced. We also want to commend those who have the steel and temerity
to take on the challenges in the Public Service and to expose problems, but
with a clear focus on turning them around.

What we do need to view with deep regret, is those of us in this House who
come here and simply shout, seeking to score points by focusing on the
negative, without looking at what they must do constructively to ensure
that we monitor what is happening in order to improve on these actions and
to put sustainable programmes in place. [Interjections.] This is the lot
who dance like cats on a hot roof. This is the lot who have always been
there, who looked at what was there in the past, but made muted noises in
terms of changing things. What we are definitely going to ensure is that
transformation takes place, that it will be sustainable and that it will be
done in a manner that those who need to be part of the army leading such
transformation will be part of it.

I would like to thank all those who came out in support of the Vote. Again,
I would like to thank members of the management team, who are with me here
today, for taking forward their hard work diligently, in spite of all
obstacles. I know that I did not mention Mr Sello Rasethaba earlier, who is
the chairperson of the State Information Technology Agency. However, he has
heard the expectations from Parliament, as well as the commendations for
the work that has been done. I would like to say to the team that it has
done a fair amount of work, but nangomso [tomorrow] is important. We need
to look at tomorrow.

At this point, I would also like to use this opportunity to thank Dr Gonda
Perez for the period of time which she has worked with me, first in Welfare
and now in Public Service and Administration. She is taking leave to go to
the University of Cape Town. Indeed, coming with the kind of commitment
that she has had over a number of years, I can see her just adding to the
transformation project that she will be working on at the University of
Cape Town. Good luck to her for her future work. Once again, I would like
to thank hon members for their participation in this debate. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
