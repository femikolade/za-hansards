                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr M J MAHLANGU: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that sunset tomorrow marks the start of the Jewish New Year,
       heralding in the year 5761 on the Hebrew calendar;

  (2) recognises that this is one of the most solemn festivals in the
       Jewish religion; and

  (3) wishes all of the Jewish community Shana Tova, a happy, prosperous
       and peaceful year and well over the fast.

[Applause.]

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes and appreciates the Democratic Alliance's ``Put the People
       First'' campaign in which the Leader of the Official Opposition, Mr
       Tony Leon, travels through the country to meet with the people and to
       experience first-hand the concerns and predicaments of all the people
       of South Africa ...
[Interjections.]
  (2) notes that the ANC-SACP-Cosatu tripartite alliance partners are more
       concerned with their ideological mind games and jobs and positions
       for themselves than having concern for the needs of the people;

  (3) expresses concern that the elected representatives of the tripartite
       alliance negated their election promises, namely ``a better life for
       all'' and ``jobs for all'', and instead only delivered jobs for a
       select few and a better life for a privileged few ...

[Interjections.]


  (4) urges Mr Leon to continue with the ``Put the People First'' campaign
       and thereby give fresh impetus to the idea of one South Africa for
       all its people.

[Interjections.]

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  a very successful celebration of Heritage Day took place at
           KwaDukuza in the Kingdom of KwaZulu-Natal on 24 September 2000;

       (b)  His Majesty, the King of the Zulus, in his address to his
           nation, emphasised his dissatisfaction with the silence of the
           President of the Republic of South Africa and reiterated the
           fact that the position of His Majesty is exactly as it was when
           His Majesty articulated the gravity of this situation in the
           public meeting of the Amakhosi on 15 January 2000 at Mangosuthu
           Technikon Stadium;

       (c)  the great concern expressed by His Majesty the King that he was
           not consulted about the municipal demarcation process which
           infringed upon His Majesty's territorial integrity and the grave
           consequences thereof if this matter is not resolved; and

       (d)  His Majesty the King recommitted his nation to peaceful
           negotiations to settle the demarcation problems ...
[Time expired.]

Mr J F VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the new tobacco regulations banning smoking in public
       places will come into operation tomorrow;

  (2) believes that this impressive move is a clear indication that the ANC-
       led Government wants to ensure that we live in a healthy environment;

  (3) welcomes the implementation of these new regulations by the
       Department of Health; and

  (4) calls on the people to uphold these new regulations.

[Applause.]
Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the stark reality of rising unemployment in South Africa and
       that -


       (a)  in the past year, 149 000 jobs were lost in the formal sector of
           the economy; and

       (b)  at this rate, another 408 people, more than all the members in
           this House, will today face the predicament of being without an
           income and will have to face the bleak prospect of finding
           another livelihood; and


  (2) calls on -


       (a)  the ANC Government to address this problem with the gravity it
           deserves; and

       (b)  its Cosatu alliance partner to start behaving in a responsible
           manner, because South Africa simply cannot afford to have a
           labour union that has no regard for the unemployed people in
           South Africa.

Chief N Z MTIRARA: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that it is a matter of grave concern that the President has
       unilaterally postponed the long-awaited meeting with traditional
       leaders, thus exacerbating the confusion created by his Government
       when it proceeded to complete municipal demarcations without
       consulting the traditional leaders on boundaries affecting their
       areas of jurisdiction;

  (2) registers its rejection of a tendency by the President to treat the
       traditional leaders with contempt, and sees this as a pattern that is
       intended to marginalise the traditional authorities;

  (3) views with perturbation the delay by the Government in announcing the
       date of the elections, which appears to be a closely guarded secret
       to which only the ruling party is privy; and

  (4) proposes that elections be shifted to a later date to avoid the
       disruption of the examinations because, if elections are held in
       November, teachers who usually officiate in the elections will be
       busy with examinations.

Ms D M MOROBI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that special agents from the Kimberley Organised Crime
       Investigation Unit, the SANDF and the National Prosecuting
       Authority's Kimberley office have smashed a massive arms smuggling
       ring operating at an SANDF ammunition depot;

  (2) commends all those involved in the arrests for their hard work; and

  (3) calls upon the SANDF to maintain strict control over its arms
       inventories in keeping with the proposed new Firearms Control Bill.

[Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the PAC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that, in terms of the law, any person is compelled to make a
       statement to the police and to furnish the required information under
       oath;

  (2) recognises that the Ministers of Safety and Security and for Justice
       and Constitutional Development have failed to provide the necessary
       information that they claim they have to arrest the Cape Town
       bombers;

  (3) notes that it is nearly two weeks since they made such claims;

  (4) calls on the attorney-general to subpoena both Ministers to provide
       the information;

  (5) is of the opinion that, should they refuse, they must both be
       arrested for misleading the public; and

  (6) otherwise requests the Ministers to confirm or deny whether they have
       furnished the information or not.

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Mevrou die Speaker, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die
volgende sittingsdag namens die FA sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die verdere beheermaatreëls wat ingestel is om die uitbraak van bek-
       en-klouseer in KwaZulu-Natal hok te slaan, steun;

  (2) kennis neem dat die uitgebreide maatreëls en die slag van duisende
       diere groot ontwrigting en finansiële verliese vir die landbousektor
       inhou;

  (3) van mening is dat die Regering die persone wat finansieel deur die
       maatreëls benadeel word vir hulle verliese sal moet vergoed; en

  (4) die Departement van Landbou versoek om so spoedig moontlik die basis
       en omvang van vergoeding aan persone en instansies wat verliese gely
       het, aan te kondig.

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the FA:


  That the House -


  (1) supports the further control measures implemented to contain the
       outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in KwaZulu-Natal;

  (2) notes that the extensive measures and the slaughter of thousands of
       animals entail major disruption and financial loss for the
       agricultural sector;

  (3) is of the opinion that the Government will have to compensate those
       persons on whom these measures have had a financially detrimental
       effect for their losses; and

  (4) requests the Department of Agriculture to announce as soon as
       possible the basis and extent of compensation to persons and
       institutions that have suffered losses.]

           September 2000 gestaak word as gevolg van 'n tekort aan fondse;

       (b)  die Minister bevestig het dat die SA Nasionale Raad vir
           Bejaardes R460 000 aangevra het om die hulplyn oop te hou; en
       (c)  die Minister weier om 'n opdrag te gee dat die departement
           fondse beskikbaar stel;


  (2) die Regering versoek om onmiddellik van die Lotto se opbrengs wat
       bedoel is vir welsyn beskikbaar te stel om hierdie noodsaaklike
       hulplyn oop te hou; en

     3) kennis neem dat, in die lig van die voortdurende mishandeling van
        bejaardes, die DP eis dat hierdie aangeleentheid as 'n saak van
        dringendheid gehanteer word.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs P W Cupido: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the helpline for the elderly, called HEAL, will be discontinued
           at the end of September 2000 due to a lack of funds;

       (b)  the Minister has confirmed that the SA National Council of the
           Aged has requested R460 000 to keep the helpline open; and

       (c)  the Minister refuses to instruct the department to make funds
           available;


  (2) requests the Government immediately to make available some of the
       proceeds of the Lotto, which are intended for welfare, in order to
       keep this essential helpline open; and

  (3) notes that, in the light of the continued abuse of the elderly, the
       DP insists that this issue be dealt with as a matter of urgency.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the world is witnessing the phenomenon of inflexibility in the
           supply of crude oil, leading to record high prices; and

       (b)  oil is a finite resource which will run out as a result of
           extensive exploitation; and


  (2) moves that alternative sources of energy be investigated by our
       Government with particular emphasis on solar energy with which we as
       a country are abundantly blessed.

Mr S T BELOT: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  an agreement for co-operation between Cape Town, St Petersburg
           and Moscow was signed yesterday; and

       (b)  the main focus of this agreement is in the field of health;


  (2) believes that agreements and co-operation of this nature enhance
       people-to-people solidarity across the globe; and

  (3) welcomes such co-operation and hopes that these cities will learn
       from one another in developing strategies to improve health standards
       of the people.

[Applause.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the New NP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with grave concern the one-sided reports that are surfacing from
           some members of the Presidential Aids Advisory Panel, the latest
           being that Aids dissidents are questioning the evidence that
           Aids is even contagious or sexually transmitted; and

       (b)  that these one-sided reports will be countered by reports from
           others on the Presidential Aids Advisory Panel, and that the
           final report from this panel will undoubtedly end in a stalemate
           because of the perplexing composition of this panel; and


  (2) expresses its concern that the Aids dissidents appear to have the ear
       of the President and the Minister of Health, which results in
       confusing and mixed signals being sent to the people of South Africa
       and which is counterproductive in our fight against Aids.

Prof L M MBADI: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next
sitting day of the House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with dismay the British government website warning potential
       tourists to South Africa of the high level of crime;

  (2) takes special note of the claim on the website that South Africa has
       the highest number of recorded rapes in the world;

  (3) recognises the huge damage that this type of negative publicity
       causes to our tourism industry;

  (4) nonetheless, acknowledges that crime is a daily reality in South
       Africa that must be addressed by Government as a matter of extreme
       urgency; and

  (5) urges Government, in the light of the job-creating potential of
       tourism, to do everything in its power to ensure the safety and
       security of all tourists visiting our country.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the University of Stellenbosch is awarding an honorary
       doctorate to Dr Beyers Naudé;

  (2) regards this as a tribute to the role played by Dr Naudé for the
       liberation of the oppressed people in South Africa; and

  (3) congratulates Dr Naudé on this award from the University of
       Stellenbosch.

[Applause.]

  (2) expresses its condolences to the families of the deceased; and

  (3) calls on the local authorities and engineers to look at this problem.

[Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the link between effective anticorruption strategies, investment
           and trade; and

       (b)  findings by the World Bank and the IMF that per capita income
           can be doubled by an effective legal system and an active
           anticorruption strategy; and


  (2) calls on the Government to prioritise a more active anticorruption
       strategy by -

           National Anticorruption Conference held in Cape Town in 1998 to
           overhaul the anticorruption legislative regime in South Africa.

members.

                   RECOMMENDATIONS OF CONFERENCE ON RACISM

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms D P S JANA: Madam Speaker, His Excellency Deputy President Zuma and hon
members, a very hearty word of congratulations to the Human Rights
Commission, especially to Dr Barney Pityana, on successfully convening a
National Conference on Racism at the request of our President Mbeki. Not
unexpectedly, this conference aroused a storm of criticism against both
President Mbeki and Dr Pityana.

It is said that President Mbeki has shifted the national focus from
reconciliation to racism, that the enormous resources for the conference
should rather have been directed to the poor, and that the debate on racism
is fuelling conflict instead of promoting peace. To say the least, such
criticisms are contemptible. Racism itself is anathema to transformation.
Unity and reconciliation cannot even begin in an environment of racism.

In fact, racism is the cause of conflicts, wars, genocides and tensions
throughout the world. The policy of racism has inflicted lasting
inequalities, reducing masses of black people to abject poverty. Therefore,
in order to address poverty seriously, racism has to be eliminated first.
This racism is captured in the United Nations' declaration of apartheid as
a crime against humanity, and in the definition of racism in the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as:


  ... any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race,
  colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or
  effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise,
  on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the
  political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

Racism is not simply an act of prejudice, as some would like us to believe.
Every so often we hear, ``We do not dislike blacks,''and even, ``Blacks are
our best friends.'' Racism does not only involve personal attitudes,
beliefs and conscious intent. Racism is implanted in social mores, cultural
practices, laws, customs and the way institutions operate. Racism can also
materialise from seemingly neutral practices. There can be no doubt that in
a historically uneven environment like ours, where there are gross
inequities, arising from racial discrimination, any race-neutral policy
will predictably have a discriminatory effect. Racism is, in fact, the
principal axis for inequalities in all spheres of life in South African
society.

Yet there are those that protest that they do not have a problem with race
and, because they do not have a problem with race, race does not exist, and
if it does exist, then constitutional guarantees, antiracist legislation
and corrective action can easily eliminate it. Therefore racism is not a
problem. Experiences such as those in North America, Brazil and Australia
have proved otherwise, that despite these laws, racism continues to be a
problem. There is racism in our schools, courts, workplaces, the Police
Service, Defence Force, our homes, the media and everywhere in our society.

Racism is a problem, and it will continue to be a problem for as long as
there is disproportionate distribution of resources between black and
white; for as long as blacks are dependent on whites for employment,
accommodation, business and consumer credit, recreation and general
subsistence; for as long as life chances such as housing, education and
medical care are determined by racial markers; and for as long as there is
a causal connection between privilege and poverty.

This conference afforded us an opportunity to engage in dialogue, to
express our experiences of racism, to analyse the nature of racism, to
examine the reasons for it and share common perspectives on how to combat
racism in order to build a nonracial, united and reconciled society and, in
so doing, promote wellbeing for all South Africans and establish peace and
stability in our country.

President Mbeki, in his address at the opening of the conference, referred
to white fears and black expectations. His reference to white fears indeed
stirred up a hornet's nest. Does this fear translate into a fear of the
unknown, a commonly-held opinion which inevitably leads to distrust and
often hatred? Or does it stem from ignorance, which breeds irrational
myths, weird notions and unfounded perceptions in respect of diversities?

Here I would like to relate a true account of a conversation between my
daughter Tina, who was then six years old, and her cousin Narissa, who was
four years old. Both were watching a dance competition on television. Tina
asked Narissa which dancers she liked. Narissa replied that she only liked
the white ones. Tina then said to Narissa:


  You are a racist. How can you like only whites, because whites are
  racist. They are responsible for apartheid and have done all the horrible
  things to black people. They have even sent my father to jail.

Narissa then replied:


  Well, Tina, I did not know that, but now that I do know, I like the black
  ones and I hate the white ones.

Tina quickly responded:


  But Narissa, not all whites are bad. There are some good whites like
  Uncle George Bizos.

Narissa then announced:


  Well, I do not know which ones are good and which ones are bad, so I
  would rather hate them all.

A much more profound fear is one that springs from the justification by the
oppressor to dominate the oppressed - that blacks are inferior. A more
tangible fear is the fear of recrimination, recrimination for fostering
pain and suffering. But the real fear is the fear of losing power,
privilege, prestige and wealth, and to forego advantages acquired as a
result of racist policies. It is this fear that is germane to the obstinate
denial that racism is a problem in our country.

The President also referred to black expectations. Primarily these
expectations are of the total and immediate transformation of society and
the restoration of human rights. As is the case in many countries, land
here, too, is a central issue. Land is the most important productive source
for employment, accommodation, and subsistence. Because black people remain
landless, they continue to depend on whites. Redistribution of land must
take place soon. This is the great expectation. This is the great black
expectation.

This conference revealed that the question of racism in South Africa is
indeed very complex. Based on its recommendations, it is necessary to
engage in a nationwide debate; to involve leading scholars on the subject;
to sustain critique in as many disciplines as possible; to undertake a
forensic audit of the way racism impacts within every sector and unit of
our society; and to introduce programmes to co-exist, which means learning
to respect and accept diversity as equals.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, can you take your seat,
please.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, may I raise a point of
order?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Point of order granted.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, we are discussing a very
important subject, the subject of racism in our society, and yet members
from the other side are involved in conversations. They are not even
listening to the debate. [Interjections.] Could you please call them to
order, Comrade Chair.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon Sheila, I am calling for
order. Pay attention to the Chair. Can I remind all hon members that,
really, this is an important debate. Can we give it the attention that it
deserves and listen to the debate from speaker to speaker. I would
appreciate it if we could conduct ourselves in that manner. You may
continue, hon member.

Ms D P S JANA: Co-existence programmes must be introduced at all levels of
learning institutions, at all levels of government and, in fact, in all
structures of society. Ultimately, democracy is about coexistence.

The findings must be discussed and debated in all relevant fora, including
Parliament, so that they can influence policies. The Human Rights
Commission must be adequately resourced and empowered to monitor the
evaluation mechanisms so as to ensure the systematic elimination of racism
stage by stage. The problem of racism must remain on the national agenda
for as long as is necessary, and racism must stay on the international
agenda, because it is a historically structured form of behaviour.

Racism can be traced to the engineering of imperialists and colonialists,
which resulted in the devaluing of the non-European identity, beginning
with slavery and the pillaging of our continent, and followed by military
invasions and conquests.

We need to collaboratively prepare for the Third United Nations World
Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related
Intolerance to be held in South Africa next year. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, hon Deputy Speaker, hon members, despite the
howling, indeed somebody rose on a point of order and said that this is a
very serious topic. I would gladly agree with that person, and I am
surprised that the benches are so empty on that side.

Let me reiterate that the fact that South Africa has gone through a
devastating history of conquest, manifesting itself in colonialism,
oppression and downright fascist and racist apartheid, cannot be ignored or
denied by even the simplest of the citizens. Where the nefarious
devastation of apartheid is not known, such ignorance serves to confirm the
depth of social engineering or indoctrination that held sway over the minds
of a section of this diverse South African population.

Racism is unfortunately currently on the agenda of apartheid political
messiahs, just as ``swart gevaar'' was during the heyday of preliberation
politicians. Racism seems to be the nearest and easiest tool to use for the
legendary age-old Gagool's witch-hunt of King Solomon's Mines.

What seems to be missing in the antiracism crusade is the obverse side of
the evil coin of racism. I maintain that racism is the twin brother or twin
sister of tribalism, or nicely put, ethnicity. Tribalism is the obverse
side of racism. Racism takes root spontaneously and rapidly on the very
false notions of tribe or ethnicity. Those who are negatively obsessed with
racism are so because of the nurturing that they have had in ethnicity or,
bluntly put, tribalism. It is superfluous to attempt to debate the meaning
of tribalism and ethnicity.

Tribes, or ethnic entities, have the fallacious and myopic notion that they
or theirs are superior in themselves. The tribes take unkindly to
outsiders, whom they call boys or girls, or the unitiated or uncircumcised,
criticising or questioning them. Critics are seen as witches to be burnt on
some tribal or national bonfire. One should conform or be damned as the
enemy of the people, or of liberation, and be ready for the pyre, if one
criticises.

It is not strange that Africa - South Africa is no exception - finds it
very easy to shout, ``Wolf, wolf! Racist, racist!'' when things seem to be
tough - that is socially, politically and especially economically. Blame
failures on racism! Blame failures on reactionary, antirevolutionary
forces! Blame witchcraft for all your ills and failures.

African presidents have a tendency to most often size up the situation and
decide their line of action and vision extraordinary. Amongst these, the
African leaders will conveniently proclaim national unity and denounce
tribalism, which is correct, but they soon discover that manipulating
tribal affiliations and invoking racist paranoia is essential to attaining
more power and preserving that selfsame power. The appeal to the base
sentiments of racism and tribalism is very attractive to leaders or a
people with grandiose dreams veering closely to political mirages.
The colonialists played their tune on the racist tribal harp and came up
with the divide-and-rule strategy. This corrosive threat seemed to be
sustained throughout the phases of South African bigotry, up to the present
day of hunt-for-racists-and-blacks- reactionaries. It is, indeed, very true
that the best authority one can ever hope to become is that of being an
authority on one's own experiences and sufferings.

Without being petty and personalising gigantic national issues, I have seen
brutality in respect of apartheid racism and tribalism. To this day, in our
own country, one still experiences bigots spewing racial hatred and
tribalism from all sides of our demographic spectrum. Stereotyping is the
benchmark of bigotry with the embattled white and black groups, both led by
some self-appointed demagogue wishing to fulfil egocentric goals draped in
dubious national or continental garb and rhetoric.

In the days of apartheid, whites were inclined to equate ``white'' with
``right'' and ``might''. Today, it seems, blacks believe that all blacks
formerly oppressed are angels and could not be accused of racism, let alone
tribalism. Of course, those notions are anything but true. [Interjections.]
Racism is not a monopoly of any one section of our country, be it white or
black, nor is tribalism the character of blacks only. [Interjections.]

I know what it means to be branded a kaffir or a Bantu. I also know what it
means to be hounded at school, on the playgrounds, at worship and in the
neighbourhood as Lekwerekwere, isilwani soMtswana and to be subjected to
all the negative concomitant stereotypes and fallacious and derogatory
epithets and treatments.

Ours is a deeply hurt and scarred society that yearns for a very deep
healing process. The wound has to be treated, and that is good. The
festering boils need to be opened and treated and, thus, healed. Yes, this
is painful, but if it is meant to heal, it is acceptable. Adding salt to
the wounds raked up for vindictive motives is no cure at all. Hitler and
Idi Amin were obsessed, and I hope we are not going to be obsessed by our
own version of racism à la McCarthyism. [Interjections.]

In short, apartheid, or racism in reserve, is counterproductive and
retrogressive. No sane leadership should take the country in that
direction. Bandwagon or no bandwagon, fruitpicker, journalist or not, our
country must be directed away from the morbid and self-righteous, holier-
than-thou and neo-ethnic racial cleansing. [Interjections.] We have hurt
one another, granted, some more than others, but we need to overcome the
hurt, the hate and the prejudice so unwisely inflicted upon ourselves.
Acrimonious finger-pointing and self-righteous pontificating will not
eradicate poverty, crime, Aids, the abuse of women and children,
unemployment and other sociopolitical and economic ills, let alone this
very scourge called tribalism which is eating us from within.

The Kempton Park, that is, the Codesa miracle needs to be sustained.
Perhaps we need to innovate the politics of deep and profound forgiveness
and reconciliation, based on human dignity, mutual respect, compassion,
justice and the imperatives of our country's Constitution. [Interjections.]

We need to follow in the footsteps of great people like Nelson Rolihlanhla
Mandela on this idea. [Interjections.] We need to follow in the great
footsteps of people like Helen Suzman and Mahatma Gandhi. If we do this, we
shall have defeated racism and tribalism when we ourselves cease to view
our environment through racist and tribalistic spectacles.

It would be no less than proper to close this humble contribution to the
racism-tribalism debate in the words of one of our most noble daughters, Dr
Mamphela Ramphele, as she rouses us to the truth and hard realities of our
current stage of transition. She observes that there were a lot of
academics and clergy who spoke fearlessly of the evils of apartheid, but we
need also to speak fearlessly of the evils of tribalism ...
[Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Mr Chairman, just over 200
years ago, a republic which is now the most powerful nation in the world
was established. It was established on the basis that all men are created
equal. That was the basis on which it was established. Two hundred years
later, the people in that republic are still not satisfied that they have
lived up to that fundamental proposition. They find that racism and its
effects are still with them and they, of course, are speaking about these
problems openly. They do not regard racism coyly, as a subject that is not
to be discussed in polite society. They are analysing the problem all the
time, and they are endeavouring to deal with it. Both candidates for the
presidency of the United States discuss this problem all the time.

How could one imagine that we would come along and establish a new society
on the basis of a society which, for decades and even centuries, was based
on racism, and in which the consequences of racism are with us at all
levels? On that foundation, on which was erected a host of racist
institutions - parliaments, laws, and courts - we now come along to build a
new society, having removed what we would call the superstructure. I am
looking directly at a friend of mine who will understand what that is.
[Laughter.] We are erecting it on an economic base which was based on
racism and all its evils. We have merely removed the superstructure and the
base still remains intact. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

What we are talking about here is not petty prejudices. That is not what we
are discussing. I do not mind it if some shop assistant calls me ``boy''.
It is irrelevant. I am more concerned with things such as residential
segregation, the absence of health facilities and the skewed kind of
education that we experience. Those are the problems that we are faced
with, and they are recognised by serious thinkers from all sides in this
country. [Interjections.] I say ``they are recognised'', but one of the
peculiarities of South Africa is that there is actually very little serious
study of the problem of racism.

If one goes into any of our libraries at the universities or into any of
the bookshops, one will find that they are very different from the
libraries and bookshops in other parts of the world, where there is a vast
amount of literature on racism and its effects. Here, in our country, they
banned such studies and the result is that very often people are not au
fait with this problem and how it can be tackled. We need to have very
serious studies on this problem and to really identify a programme of
action that will enable us to achieve the objectives that are enshrined in
our Constitution.

I am always arguing with my friends on all sides of the House, and some of
my Afrikaner friends have said to me: ``Maar, Minister, julle is die
Regering. Hoekom kla julle? Julle moet regeer.'' [But Minister, you are the
Government. Why are you complaining? You must govern.] Well, there is a
point which we also have to take into account. In the United States the
people who suffer the ravages of racism are a minority. They are not in
power. In our country, it is a very different situation in that the people
who suffered from racism are in power. Therefore, the challenge is not only
for those who were in power, but it is for those who are in power now. That
means all of us have to work out a programme of action to deal with racism
in a very intelligent manner that will operate to the advantage of our
country in the long term.

I have looked at the document from the conference on racism that has been
circulated, and I was a bit surprised to find out that the Human Rights
Commission is expected to draw up a programme to deal with racism. They are
not in power. They are creatures of statute. They are appointed. They are
not democratically elected. I do not think that people in that position can
do more than monitor the progress, or otherwise, that is made with regard
to racism. But surely they cannot be entrusted with the sovereign task of
working out a proper programme for the elimination of racism in this
country at all levels?

I believe that we must not be coy about this subject. We must not be shy to
discuss it, after all, we used to have arguments and discussions with the
proponents of apartheid. We used to argue with all of them. Dr Verwoerd and
others used to come to my own home and have arguments with my father about
apartheid. We used to argue with them openly. They would justify their
point of view, and we would tell them that we were opposed to it.

Similarly, we must discuss racism openly, and we must be very careful about
the possibility of sweeping things under the carpet, because if we do that
we face the choice of either reform from above or revolution from below, a
risk which many rulers in the world have faced. If we do not deal with this
problem, we will get more and more discontent, our society will become more
and more unstable and, in the end, nobody can benefit from a society that
we are failing to create.

Therefore nonracialism is in the interests of all of us, everybody, white
or black, capitalist or worker. We really need to tackle the problems of
racism in a manner that will do credit to our country and also serve as an
example to a world to which we preached for decades about the evils of
apartheid and racism. We cannot now, suddenly, tell the world that all the
things we said in all the international organisations and all the different
states were really not as serious as we painted then, that they are
something that can just disappear because we have established a democratic
state.

We will have to take very practical, serious steps, and those steps will
have to involve participation by all elements of our population, all
sectors of our population, universities, businesspeople, the private
sector, labour and Government. We should all be involved in this mammoth
task which may take us two or three decades before we can say that we have
achieved a tangible result.

I have a son whose speciality is studying the European Union and how it is
succeeding. He estimates it will take us 40 years. I hope he is wrong.
[Applause.]

Mr M C J VAN SCHALKWYK: Chairperson, racism exists. Many racist practices
still continue and new racist practices have been added. The irony of our
debate today is that those who once described and fought for South Africa
as one nation, now label us as two divided parts. [Interjections.] Those
who were once accused of dividing that one nation, now argue for one united
nation. The question all of us should ask ourselves is whether this debate
says more about real convictions or more about narrow self-interest. Those
who understand the importance of building our country should take the
advice of Alexander Herzen that ``the point is to open men's eyes, not to
tear them out''.

The old South Africa was like a cancer patient with a deadly tumour - the
tumour of racism. Visionaries in the form of Mandela and De Klerk stepped
in and applied radical treatment. [Interjections.] We all believed that the
cancer of racism was in remission and the patient well on the way to
recovery. Over the last year, however, we have suddenly discovered that the
tumour is back. Instead of being described, as we were during the first
five years of our new democracy, as the rainbow nation, we are suddenly
told that we are two nations, divided again on the basis of skin colour.
This description, by emphasising our differences, only further divides us.

The starting point of the new South Africa was formulated in exemplary
fashion by Mr Mandela in his inauguration speech as President, and I quote:


  We enter into a covenant that we shall build a society in which all South
  Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall without any
  fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity
  - a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world.

We started off the new South Africa with the concept of one nation, built
on newly discovered commonalities and on the basis of a shared patriotism.
If we cannot succeed in building upon and extending that basic ideal, then
black and white and coloured and Indian in our country will be reduced to
simple co-existence on a shared piece of land with no real reconciliation
and no rainbow nation.

Die onregverdighede van apartheid was gegrond op 'n uiterste vorm van
rassisme. Diegene wat dit probeer ontken, doen nie net dié wat onder
apartheid gely het 'n onreg aan nie, maar ook dié wat vandag steeds werk om
die nalatenskap van apartheid te oorkom.

Om egter die verlede te blameer vir al die probleme van die Suid-Afrika van
vandag, is 'n oorvereenvoudiging en in baie gevalle 'n ontduiking van
verantwoordelikheid. Om die definisie van rassisme te beperk tot wit
rassisme alleen, is om 'n groot deel van die werklikheid te ignoreer. Die
werklikheid is dat rassisme in alle gemeenskappe voorkom, ongeag taal of
agtergrond. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The injustices of apartheid were based on an extreme form of racism. Those
who try to deny this, are not only doing the people who suffered under
apartheid an injustice, but also those who are still working today to
overcome the legacy of apartheid.

However, to blame the past for all the problems of South Africa today is an
oversimplification and, in many cases, amounts to evading responsibility.
To limit the definition of racism to white racism only is to ignore a large
part of the reality. The reality is that racism occurs in all communities,
irrespective of language or background.]

The fundamental flaw in our present debate on racism is how it is being
conducted and what the motivation behind it is. If the motivation is to
find solutions to really build a new nation, based on new common
experiences, then the present debate is counterproductive. If the
motivation is a more partisan political one, then it is much easier to
understand the context.
Let us, for a moment, forget all the political considerations and let me
share with hon members how I, as a member of a minority community,
experience this debate. I would like to make some remarks with regard to
the ANC, because it currently represents the majority of black South
Africans. The ANC's views on this issue are therefore, yes, party-
political, but its views are more than that.

The ANC is a strong political party, numerically speaking. It controls the
Government and almost, in its own words, all levers of power. But in that
position of overwhelming political control, there seems to be an
uncertainty and sometimes an inability to accept that it is now in the
driver's seat. Like any government taking over a country after a period of
deep division, it is starting to experience difficulties in translating its
ideals into concrete gains, because Government has limited resources.

Instead of attempting to convince all South Africans to take co-ownership
of the challenges, the ANC is rather opting for the approach of identifying
scapegoats. [Interjections.] The way I experience the ANC is that it is
moving away from its commitment to nonracialism. The ANC of Albert Luthuli,
of Z K Matthews and of Nelson Mandela was undoubtedly a party committed to
nonracialism, and that had to be conceded even by its opponents.

Suddenly, though, those of us who are not members of the ANC have
experienced a change in direction. We have sensed a change in the winds.
Suddenly the concept of nonracialism has been replaced, not by a soft
version of multiracialism, but by a stark, rigid concept of two nations on
the basis of skin colour. Coupled with that are the frequent attempts to
put white South Africans in the dock, in the sin-bin of history.

It does not help then to occasionally, as President Mbeki did here last
week, say that not all Afrikaners and whites should be held accountable for
the past. When the issue of historical guilt is switched on and off,
depending on the political consideration of the moment, it becomes a
divisive issue containing the seeds of resentment. One cannot one day tell
people how bad they are, or how guilty they are, that they should be taxed
only on the basis of their skin colour, and the next day give them a pat on
the head and believe that this will provide a basis for trust and building
a strong nation on common ideals and experiences.
Those of us who are not in the ANC observe, in this debate, a battle for
the soul of the ANC. Yes, it is an internal matter for the ANC, but that
battle will determine the way that our country will eventually go. It will
determine if we are able to really build a rainbow nation or whether we
will be condemned to living in two separate nations perpetually. Many
children and young people from the minority communities are asking
themselves what future they have in this country if they will be constantly
attacked simply on the basis of their birthright. The hon ANC member Mr
Ramgobin recently wrote in the Cape Times:


  The ANC will not hold the young in the white community responsible for
  the ills and racial bigotry of their parents.

The reality is, however, that this is exactly what is happening. Rhoda
Kadalie, well known to many in the ANC-benches, former South African Human
Rights Commissioner, recently made two observations that are more than just
thought-provoking. She said:


  The Government under Mbeki behaves as if it regrets its negotiated
  settlement with its former oppressors and he now seems to want to punish
  white South Africans for this compromise by harping constantly on the
  race issue.

She also observed the following:


  Racism flourishes in contexts where it has been internalised to such an
  extent that the victim begins to miss it when it begins to disappear.

What is needed in South Africa is for us to address the issue of racism
through a two-pronged approach. The first prong should be a normative,
legislative one in which the representatives of the people prescribe the
manner in which racism is to be avoided and addressed. South Africa has an
excellent Bill of Rights. We have an overabundance of legislation and such
prescriptions. By far the more important prong is the necessity for
positive action and constructive nation-building emphasising that which
binds us, not that which divides us.

Racism is not only the absence of tolerance. It is ignorance about our
common humanity. But, apart from this prong being the most important, it is
also the more difficult. It requires from political leaders an unequivocal
commitment to nonracialism, because South Africans are very adept at
sensing token commitment to nonracialism. The key to unlocking this door
is, in reality and in practice, in the hands of President Mbeki. Our
impression is that he has misplaced that key. There are many good men and
women, in the words of former President Mandela, from all political
persuasions and in all political parties who are ready to assist President
Mbeki in unlocking that door. Chief Albert Luthuli's writings hold,
perhaps, the most pertinent advice in this regard for his ultimate
successor:


  The task is not finished. South Africa is not yet a home for all her sons
  and daughters. We could not achieve the new South Africa overnight, but
  we could begin to build it.]

[Applause.]

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Mr Chairman and Deputy President, I would like to say to
Deputy Minister Matthews - Oom Joe - that I can only concur with the things
that he said.
 
There are two things that have never ceased to amaze me. The first is the
dignity of the oppressed. The second is the irony of history in that the
oppressed have an obligation imposed on them to be the ones who liberate
the oppressor, to be the ones who make sure that those who oppressed us
never cause the same suffering and that we ourselves, who were oppressed,
make sure that the suffering, pain and humiliation that we went through is
not repeated. These two things have never ceased to amaze me. But, because
we are born of those who suffered, we will uphold that dignity of the
oppressed.

At the end of World War II, South African soldiers who had fought side by
side were rewarded and acknowledged on a racial basis when they came back
victorious from fighting a common enemy. [Interjections.] These soldiers
had faced bullets, shells and bombs, and those things know no colour. My
grandfather, who is black, was rewarded for his participation in World War
II with a bicycle, trench coat and a knobkerrie and, as far as I know, with
no pension. [Interjections.] The coloured soldiers were similarly awarded
with humiliating and unspeakable insults for their contributions. Regarding
the white soldiers, some of them were rewarded with farms, with rifles and
others even with automatic entry into universities. These are people who
had survived the same bombs, bullets and shells which know no colour. This,
clearly, was racism in action.

An HON MEMBER: That was before apartheid.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Somebody over there says that that was before apartheid.
I know that. Does he not know that?

Our challenge today is to ensure that our armed forces are not defined by
the example that was set at the end of World War II. Our armed forces are
like a clenched fist. But, that clenched fist is at the end of an arm. If
that arm is not healthy, there will never be a unified Defence Force. In
the recent past the Defence ministerial commission of inquiry into the
SANDF has, in its preliminary findings, reported, without mincing its
words, that racism does exist in the Defence Force. I will make it
possible, next week on Tuesday, for the committees of Parliament to discuss
that report.

These preliminary outcomes of the Setai commission will be dealt with, but
they have made certain observations that I must quickly refer to. They say,
in that document, that racism in our armed forces manifests itself in many
ways. It comes in the form of outright abusive language based on cultural
origin; failure to empower people and active attempts to reduce their job
responsibilities; harassment, such as instituting disciplinary actions
against black members and going through with the process or leaving it in
abeyance, thus leaving a member in limbo for an indefinite period;
subjecting members to assaults and intimidating them to ensure that they do
not report the cases to the police.

There are many other things that we can refer to. However, what we do know
is that these are outcomes of an institutionalisation of racism. These are
still evident in many spheres of our socioeconomic life. The evils of 1910,
the evils of 1913 and the evils of 1948 will need a programmatic
intervention by the state and all of us. There is no other way of undoing
so many decades of racist madness without such an intervention which,
obviously, cannot be done overnight.

There are many challenges imposed on us by our racist past. Failure to meet
these challenges in the early days of our democracy would be totally
disastrous. Today, the United States of America is still confronted with a
problem more than a century old. Only today, in the United States of
America, a heated debate is being waged on whether the current
administration should apologise for slavery or not. It is going to be a
difficult debate because it was not challenged as early as possible.

Over the past weekend, journalist Duncan Campbell made a number of
observations on racism in some pockets of the Unites States of America.
Duncan Campbell observed that there are groups and journals in the US,
which still promote notions such as that blacks have smaller brains, and
that many slaves were willing to be slaves. This is quoted from a recent
publication of the Ashfield Journal, a Southern nationalist journal.

There is only one obligation that we have, and that obligation, I repeat,
is an obligation on all of us, but I know that the amazing spirit of the
oppressed will not fail to be vigilant in carrying out that obligation. Let
me end by quoting the words of Mark Potok, quoted as well by Duncan
Campbell, when he says:


  White supremacists do not always come wearing Klan hoods, shaved heads or
  storm trooper outfits. Sometimes they boast business suits and PhDs.

Let us be vigilant, let us fight racism. [Applause.]

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Chairperson ...

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: [Inaudible.]
[Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr B H HOLOMISA: Chairperson, this is tantamount to cultural intimidation
on the part of the hon the Minister. I am not a kwedini little boy, I am
the leader of a party. [Laughter.]

The racial, social and economic disparities that have been inherited as our
historical legacy remain fundamentally unaltered after six years of a
democratic dispensation in South Africa. It is understood that a social
order that has been sustained by the exploitation of racial and cultural
differences over centuries, in order to facilitate conquest, land
dispossession and political hegemony of a minority caste, cannot be
overturned in such a short period. The institutionalisation of racism by
the apartheid regime blighted the psyche of generations of South Africans
of all races and hues. It is going to take a great deal of effort by all
South Africans to rid our society of the scourge.

The ushering in of a democratic dispensation, based on a model constitution
designed to ensure the permanent demise of racism and all forms of
discrimination and oppression, mandated the Government to formulate and
adopt policies, and to enact measures that would empower visible
transformation of the social and economic relations in a meaningful way
that would rapidly erode the material barriers that divide the entire
nation into haves and have-nots. It cannot be said the Government is
succeeding in carrying out that mandate. Government must recognise that
racism cannot simply be erased from people's minds by impassioned sermons
and appeals. It will diminish as a result of the alteration of the material
conditions that were deliberately created to nurture it.

The economic measures adopted by the Government exacerbate unemployment and
poverty of the vast majority of the marginalised who continue to be the
victims of racism. Policies, which aggravate unemployment and condemn
millions to destitute lives, cannot erase the feeling of racial inferiority
and helplessness of these people, nor change the attitude of racial
superiority of the racial minorities, who enjoy the social and economic
ascendancy and to whom the disadvantaged must look for favours. South
Africans must agree jointly on an economic policy that will address these
social ills.

Prior to the 1994 democratic dispensation, the apartheid opposition had
succeeded in welding people of all races into a unified force without
regard to race or ethnicity. Nonracialism and nonethnicism became
fundamental principles of our Constitution. Sadly, the spectre of racism
and ethnicity is rearing its ugly head again in the work situation.
Officials in both the public and private sector are creating racial and
ethnic fiefdoms in departments under their control. So strong are these
ethnic groupings that merit has ceased to be the criterion of selection for
a job. It is a matter of grave concern that this is happening at leadership
level at which the good example should have been set.

Njengokuba esazi ke uSekela-Mongameli, ngexesha ekwakusiliwa ngalo,
kusilwelwa inkululeko, yayisaziwa into yokuba xa amaqabane okanye amalungu
oMkhonto weSizwe ewile kwakungatshiwo ukuba awile. Kwakuye kuthiwe amajoni
omukkhonto abethile. Kodwa ngoku, emva kokuba sikhululekile, ixhaphakile
into yokuba umntu xa efika kwisakhiwo esithile abuze: ``Hey, mangaphi
amaNdiya alapha, mangaphi amaXhosa alapha, mangaphi amaZulu alapha?''
Isizalhu soko kukuba kaloku ngoku kuyatyiwa kuyaxatyanwa. Ke siyamcela
usekela Mongamen akuba akhe uyiqwalasele nayo le meko yobuhlanga kuba
ingalibulala eli lizwe. [Kwaqhwatywa] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph
follows.)

As the hon Deputy President knows, during the time of the liberation
struggle, it was known that when Umkhonto weSizwe cadres had fallen, they
were not said to have fallen but it was taken in the spirit that they had
hit. However, now that we are liberated, it is common practice, when one
enters a building, to hear questions like: ``How many Indians are here,
Xhosa speaking people and Zulus?'' The reason for this is that as people
are now benefiting, quarrels are beginning to emerge. We would, therefore,
like to plead with the hon Deputy President to address this issue of racism
very seriously as it has the potential to destroy this country.
[Applause.]]
Rev K R J MESHOE: Chairperson, hon Minister, I want to start my
contribution to this debate by endorsing some principles that were affirmed
by the National Conference on Racism which was held in Sandton.
[Interjections.] Among other things, the conference affirmed that all who
live here are citizens in equal measure, South Africans with equal
responsibility to give content and expression to the founding principles of
nationhood.

Most of us believe that all human beings are created in the image of God
and are equal in value, dignity and worth from the moment of conception.
Because all nations were created by the same God from one blood, there is
no individual person with blood that is not red. We may look different on
the outside, but our inner parts and colours are the same. This makes all
people equally important, precious, and born with inherent value that is
not dependent on their geographical location, economic status, or skin
colour.

Oppression of one race group by another, oppression of one tribe by
another, and oppression of weaker nations by stronger nations, is evil,
unacceptable and ungodly, and has to be deplored by all peace-loving
citizens of our country. The fallacy that one race group is superior to the
others because of their skin colour, political and economic power, or even
historical advantage, must be deplored and corrected. How this correcting
is done, however, will determine whether we will be successful in our
efforts or not.

For many years in our country, legislation was used to separate people
according to their skin colour. Family members and loved ones were
separated by apartheid laws and policies. The majority of our people were
denied freedom of movement and fair economic activity, amongst other
things. Such evil policies caused unnecessary suffering, anger, hatred,
suspicion, and even death. Forced separation by law divided the nation.

Let me be quick to warn that as forced separation failed in the past,
forced integration, in future, will also fail to produce national
reconciliation and unity. Forced marriages do not last, as they do not have
the bond of love and trust necessary to keep them together.

The fight against racism can be won with the re-education of those who were
indoctrinated, and not with confrontation. What is needed urgently in this
country is good antiracism education, especially at primary and secondary
school level, highlighting the importance of the content and quality of
one's character. Our people must be reminded that it is both ungodly and
illegal to discriminate against others on the basis of their skin colour.

We must build trust and relationships, which may take some time. With
patience and determination, we can build one nation under God, where one's
skin colour is not elevated above one's character and personality; where
there will be acceptance of our outer differences as normal; and where all
South Africans will work together for peace, prosperity, and unity in
diversity. [Applause.]

Mr P A GERBER: Mr Chairperson, I listened to my friend Marthinus van
Schalkwyk with expectations a while ago. But I now know why his party has
contracted anorexia. In almost every speech of his he refers to whites,
blacks, Indians and coloureds, and this has been bothering members of his
own party, sitting there with him for many years. He must stop doing that.
He is wasting his talents. We are trying to build a nation, and we want him
to be part of that. I cannot believe that he has reversed so much in his
political thinking. [Interjections.]

Ek haal graag die antwoord aan van president Mbeki op 'n vraag wat verlede
week in hierdie Huis aan hom gestel is:


  Ek dink wanneer jy na die evolusie van ons geskiedenis kyk, sal jy die
  kwessie van die Afrikaner se aandeel in apartheid baie anders ontleed.
  Dit sal verkeerd wees om te sê ``Jy is 'n Afrikaner, daarom is jy
  verantwoordelik vir apartheid en is jy vervloek.''

As jy gaan kyk na die Vrouemonumentmuseum in Bloemfontein, sal jy sien daar
is foto's van swartmense wat gedurende die Anglo-Boereoorlog in oop
treintrokke weggetrok is na swart konsentrasiekampe. Net langs dit is daar
foto's van wit vrouens en kinders wat in toe treintrokke weggetrok is na
wit konsentrasiekampe. Daar is baie ander voorbeelde in ons land. So kom
ons wees 'n slag blatant eerlik en erken dat rassisme in Suid-Afrika nie in
1948 met die vorige NP-regering begin is nie. Afrikaners ken rassisme en
was ook dekades lank slagoffers van wit-op-wit rassisme. Ons ken dit nou
nog.

Ek wil graag kom by die Suid-Afrikaanse Millenniumverklaring oor Rassisme,
en wel by item 17 van die program van aksie rakende grondhervorming wat
voorgestel word. Daar is egter 'n paar wanpersepsies met betrekking tot
grond wat ongelukkig aan die lewe gehou word deur mense met verskuilde
agendas. Die persepsie dat 87% van alle grond in Suid-Afrika in wit hande
en 13% in swart hande sou wees, was byvoorbeeld jare gelede al verouderd.
Die suggestie dat daar te min grond in Suid-Afrika is, is ook verkeerd.

Die persepsie dat grondeienaars, en veral boere, onwillig is om deel te
neem aan grondhervormingsinisiatiewe is 'n gevaarlike veralgemening. Dit
lyk my daar is sommige mense in Suid-Afrika wat nie kan asemhaal nie tensy
hulle iewers in die land op 'n podium staan en boere beswadder. Natuurlik
is daar sekere boere wat hulle skuldig maak aan sekere onwettige
arbeidspraktyke, net soos daar vis-en-tjips-kafee-eienaars is wat hulle
werkers laat swaarkry, of restaurante in Seepunt wat hulle werkers vieruur
soggens huis toe stuur, maar wanneer dit 'n boer is, is die duiwel los.
Hierdie optrede blaas rassisme aan. Ons moenie boere kritiseer met 'n mond
vol kos nie.

Die Wet op die Uitbreiding van Sekerheid van Verblyfreg was lankal
broodnodig in Suid-Afrika. Afrikaners het respek vir verblyfreg, want ons
is al baie uitgesit, maar ek sien deesdae 'n ongesonde situasie met
betrekking tot plaaswerkershuise. Sommige boere breek arbeiderhuise af
sodra hulle leegraak en sommige boere wil nie arbeiderhuise verbeter nie,
want doen hulle dit, moet hulle soortgelyke geriewe aan die afgedankte
werkers verskaf.

My probleem is, indien 'n wet iemand so motiveer om huise op sy eie grond
af te breek, dan dink ek daar kan dalk onbedoelde gevolge aan daardie wet
verbonde wees. Indien dit die geval is, behoort ons daarna te kyk, net soos
president Mbeki vroeër vanjaar gesê het dat daar onbedoelde gevolge met
betrekking tot sekere arbeidswetgewing is en dat dit verander gaan word.
Net so kan daar dalk ook sekere aspekte wees met betrekking tot hierdie
wet. Ek weet nie, maar dit is hartseer om te sien hoe mense huise afbreek
in 'n land waar miljoene mense nog in sinkhokke bly. Die wedersydse
verkeerde interpretasie van hierdie wet is 'n groot oorsaak van rassisme.

Een van die grootste apartheidsinstrumente wat veroorsaak dat derduisende
mense nog bywoners is, is die stelsel van beskikbaarheidsgeld vir
byvoorbeeld water, krag, riool, vullisverwydering ensovoorts. As Coca-Cola
van môre af vir 'n mens 'n rekening stuur van R10 'n maand omdat daar
blikkies Coca-Cola op die winkelrakke beskikbaar is, sal jy dink dit is 'n
grap. Dit is egter dieselfde beginsel waarop beskikbaarheidsgeld gegrond
is.

Baie van die derduisende armes kan nie die maandelikse beskikbaarheidsgeld
bekostig nie. Baie leë erwe in die platteland is spotgoedkoop, maar die
gemeenskap kan nie die beskikbaarheidsgeld bekostig nie. Nou die dag het 'n
stadsklerk vir my gesê daar is baie erwe te koop teen R500 in sy dorp, want
hulle neem gereeld erwe terug by mense wat nie die R100 'n maand
beskikbaarheidsgeld kan betaal nie. Vyf en twintig persent van die mense in
die land leef op minder as R7 'n dag; hoe gaan hulle nog R100 'n maand
beskikbaarheidsgeld betaal?

Hierdie stelsel het swartmense subtiel ontgrond en na informele gebiede
gedwing. Ons het hopeloos te veel rompslomp as dit kom by grondbesit in dié
land. Ons moet grondbesit in Suid-Afrika dringend liberaliseer, en dit
behoort 'n meervoudige proses te wees. Die een proses moet deur die staat
gedryf word en die ander proses spontaan deur die publiek en grondeienaars.
Spontane meganismes moet geskep word, en ek wil vir agb lede 'n paar
moontlike voorbeelde noem.

Die onderverdeling van grond behoort baie vergemaklik te word. Opmeetkoste
kan ook drasties verlaag word indien die diskriminasie tussen landmeters en
opmeters verminder word. Ons vind dieselfde situasie in die stads- en
streekbeplannersberoep. Baie munisipaliteite sal die grond verniet vir 'n
mens gee, maar die opmeetkoste maak dat die grond te duur raak. Dan praat
ek nie eens van die Eerstewêreldse bouregulasies nie.

Die proses van eiendomsregistrasie is ook heeltemal te duur en omslagtig.
'n Mens kan 'n Porsche teen R1 miljoen invoer, self al die papierwerk met
jou hande gaan doen en daarna die voertuig self by die munisipaliteit op
jou naam gaan registreer, maar as jy 'n erfie in Loxton koop, moet jy dit
deur 'n prokureur laat registreer wat jou meer kos as wat die erfie werd
is. [Tussenwerpsels.] Al hierdie dinge polariseer grondbesit.

Ons behoort te kyk of ons nie die termyn van 30 jaar in ons
verjaringswetgewing kan verkort na 20 jaar nie. As mense 30 jaar lank nie
grond gebruik nie, verdien hulle nie om dit te besit nie. Swartmense is
onvertroud met die proses van eiendomsaankope. Ons behoort die proses meer
verbruikersvriendelik te maak. Ons moet ons insolvensiewetgewing verander
sodat mense se huise nie onder hulle opgeveil kan word om skuld te delg
nie. Dit is in baie ander lande die geval. Banke sal vir 'n mens binne vyf
minute R50 000 vir 'n voertuig leen, maar sal baie teëstribbel as jy hulle
vra om vir jou R5 000 vir 'n erfie te leen. Oorsese grondkopers behoort
verplig te word om hulle eiendom hier te verbeter of ten minste net in
stand en produktief te hou.

Al hierdie faktore belemmer grondhervorming en is 'n luukse wat ons nie kan
bekostig nie. Daar is vreeslik baie deskundiges in hierdie eiendomswêreld
sonder grond op hulle naam, net soos daar landbou-adviseurs is wat op die
sewende verdieping in 'n vuil woonstel met twee potplante boer. So is daar
duisende finansiële adviseurs wat nie een 'n miljoenêr is nie. Ons moet
pasop vir hulle.

Ek wil afsluit. Ons as Afrikaners behoort 'n leidende rol te speel in
grondhervorming in Suid-Afrika, want ons het al twee voete stewig in
Afrika. Ons het nie 'n tannie in Engeland of 'n oom in Australië nie. Net
soos Suid-Afrikaners ``South Africans'' is, is Afrikaners ``Africans''.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to quote the reply by President Mbeki to a question put to
him in this House last week:


  I think if one looked at the evolution of our history, then one would
  analyse the matter differently. To say, ``You are an Afrikaner, and
  therefore you are responsible for apartheid, so damn you'', would be
  incorrect.

If one looks at the Women's Monument Museum in Bloemfontein, one will see
that there are photographs of black people who were trucked to black
concentration camps in open train carriages during the Anglo Boer War. Next
to these, there are photographs of white women and children who were
trucked to white concentration camps in closed train carriages. There are
many other examples in our country. So let us be blatantly honest for a
change and admit that racism in South Africa did not begin in 1948 with the
previous NP government. Afrikaners are familiar with racism and were also
victims of white-on-white racism for decades. We are still familiar with it
now.
I would like to come to the South African Millennium Statement on Racism,
and specifically to item 17 of the programme of action regarding land
reform, which is being proposed. However, there are a few misconceptions
with regard to land which are unfortunately being kept alive by people with
hidden agendas. The perception that 87% of all land in South Africa is in
white hands and 13% in black hands, for example, was antiquated years ago
already. The suggestion that there is too little land in South Africa is
also incorrect.

The perception that landowners, and farmers in particular, are unwilling to
participate in land reform initiatives, is a dangerous generalisation. It
seems to me that there are some people in South Africa who cannot breathe
unless they are standing on a podium somewhere in the country and
slandering farmers. Of course there are certain farmers who are guilty of
certain illegal labour practices, just as there are fish-and-chips-café
owners who allow their workers to suffer, or restaurants in Sea Point which
send their workers home at four o'clock in the morning, but when it is a
farmer, there is hell to pay. This behaviour incites racism. We must not
criticise farmers with a mouth full of food.
The Extension of Security of Tenure Act has been essential in South Africa
for a long time. Afrikaners respect tenure, because we have been evicted
many times, but these days I am seeing an unhealthy situation with regard
to farmworkers' homes. Some farmers demolish labourers' houses as soon as
they are empty, and some farmers do not want to improve labourers' houses,
because if they do so, they must supply similar facilities to the dismissed
workers.

My problem is, if an Act motivates someone to demolish houses on his own
land, I think there could perhaps be unintentional consequences associated
with that Act. If that is the case, we should look at it, just as President
Mbeki said earlier this year that there were certain unintentional
consequences with regard to certain labour legislation and that it was to
be changed. In the same way there could perhaps also be certain aspects
with regard to this Act. I do not know, but it is sad to see people
demolishing houses in a country where millions of people still live in tin
shacks. The mutually incorrect interpretation of this Act is a big cause of
racism.

One of the biggest apartheid instruments which results in thousands of
people still being share-croppers, is the system of an availability fee,
for example for water, power, sewerage, garbage removal, etc. Were Coca-
Cola to send one an account of R10 a month from tomorrow onwards because
there are tins of Coca-Cola available on the shelves, one would think it
was a joke. However, this is the same principle on which an availability
fee is based.

Many of the thousands of poor people cannot afford the monthly availability
fee. Many empty plots in the rural areas are ridiculously cheap, but the
community cannot afford the availability fee. Recently a councillor told me
that there were many plots for sale for R500 in his town, because they
regularly repossess plots from people who cannot pay the availability fee
of R100 per month. Twenty-five per cent of the people in this country live
on less than R7 a day; how are they still going to pay an availability fee
of R100 per month?

This system subtly dispossessed black people and forced them to informal
areas. We have hopelessly too much red tape when it comes to landownership
in this country. We must urgently liberalise landownership in South Africa,
and it should be a multiple process. One process should be driven by the
state, and the other process spontaneously by the public and landowners.
Spontaneous mechanisms must be created, and I want to mention a few
possible examples to hon members.

The subdivision of land should be made far easier. Surveying costs can also
be drastically reduced if the discrimination between land surveyors and
surveyors is reduced. We find the same situation with regard to town and
regional planners professions. Many municipalities will give one the land
for free, but the surveying costs make the land too expensive. Then I am
not even talking about the First World building regulations.

The process of property registration is also far too expensive and
cumbersome. One can import a Porsche for R1 million, do all the paperwork
oneself by hand and then go and register the vehicle in one's name with the
municipality, but if one buys a small plot in Loxton, one has to have it
registered by an attorney, which costs you more than the plot is worth.
[Interjections.] All these things polarise landownership.

We should look at whether we cannot decrease the term of 30 years in our
statute of limitations to 20 years. If people do not use land for 30 years,
they do not deserve to own it. Black people are unfamiliar with the process
of property purchasing. We should make the process more consumer-friendly.
We must change our insolvency legislation so that people's houses cannot be
auctioned from under them to recover debt. This is the case in many other
countries. Banks will lend one R50 000 for a vehicle in five minutes, but
will argue a great deal if one asks them to lend one R5 000 for a small
plot of ground. Foreign buyers should be obliged to improve their property
here or at least to maintain it and keep it productive.

All these factors are hampering land reform and are a luxury we cannot
afford. There are a great many experts in this property world without any
land to their name, just as there are agricultural advisers who farm with
two pot plants in an untidy flat. In the same way there are thousands of
financial advisers not one of whom on the seventh floor is a millionaire.
We must be aware of of them.

I want to conclude. We as Afrikaners should play a leading role in land
reform in South Africa, because we have both feet firmly in Africa. We do
not have an aunt in England or an uncle in Australia. Just as ``Suid-
Afrikaners'' are South Africans, ``Afrikaners'' are Africans.]

Enkosi kakhulu. [Thank you very much.]

Ke a leboha. [Mahofi.] [I thank you. [Applause.]]

Dr C P MULDER: Mevrou die Speaker, ek wil met die agb lid mnr Gerber
saamstem dat Afrikaners 'n groot rol moet speel in grondherverdeling. As ek
na die register van ledebelange kyk, moet ek sê mnr Gerber kan waarskynlik
op sy eie 'n reuseverskil maak daar met sy eie belange as hy dit sou begin
verdeel.

Ek wil ook vir mnr Gerber sê hy moet 'n bietjie in sy geskiedenis gaan kyk
oor die trokke na die konsentrasiekampe in die Anglo-Boereoorlog. My eie
ouma het saam met vier kleiner broers in 'n oop koletrok gery, en nie in
een van die fênsie Blou Trein-trokke waarvan hy hier kom vertel het nie.
Dit is nonsens en hy behoort dit te weet. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I want to agree with the hon member Mr
Gerber that Afrikaners should play a significant role in land
redistribution. When I look at the register of members' interests, I must
say that Mr Gerber, all by himself, could probably make a major difference
in that respect with his own interests if he should start redistributing
it.

I also want to tell Mr Gerber to look into his own history, regarding the
wagons to the concentration camps in the Anglo Boer War. My own
grandmother, along with her four brothers, rode in an open coal wagon, and
not one of those fancy Blue Train wagons that he spoke about here. That is
nonsense and he should know it. [Interjections.]]

Perceptions, perceptions, perceptions! We have one subject today for
discussion, but completely opposing points of view. Why? Because reality
and history are perceived completely differently by the people in this room
today. At the end of August again we had a conference on racism.

Weer eens was daar persepsies, persepsies, persepsies. Hoe die konferensie
ook al aangebied is, my persepsie was dat dit 'n eensydige affêre was,
klaar en afgehandel. Dit is die persepsie wat aan my oorgedra is, en as ek
so luister na van die bydraes vandag hier, dan word dit ook so bevestig.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Once again there were perceptions, perceptions, perceptions. In whatever
way the conference was presented, my perception was that it was a one-sided
affair, and that was the end of the matter. That is the perception that was
conveyed to me, and when I listen to some of the contributions here today,
then that is confirmed.]

Hon President Mbeki in his speech noted the need to address white fears and
black expectations. During negotiations in the past we said to Mr Mbeki
that he was wrong. We are not talking about white fears, but about
legitimate rights of different communities in South Africa. As long as he
thinks the problem is that we have to address fears he will never succeed
in getting South Africa away from racism. He has to address the legitimate
rights and aspirations not only of the Afrikaner community, but of all the
communities in South Africa. As long as he does not do that we will
continue to struggle with things such as racism.

Die agb mev Jana het in haar toespraak gesê rassisme moet eers uitgeroei
word voordat daar sprake kan wees van nasiebou en vooruitgang. Ek wil die
stelling maak: rassisme, nie net in Suid-Afrika nie, maar ook
internasionaal, is nie 'n doel op sigself nie. Wie sal nou rassisme as 'n
doel op sigself nastreef? Dit kan nooit 'n doel op sigself wees nie.

Dit is veel eerder 'n simptoom van 'n dieper onderliggende probleem in 'n
gemeenskap of in 'n land, en daardie probleem kom onder meer na vore in die
vorm van rassisme. Die probleem in Suid-Afrika, en dit is my persepsie, is
dat die grondwetlike resep vir Suid-Afrika verkeerd is. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon Mrs Jana said in her speech that racism had to be eradicated
before there could be any suggestion of nation-building and prosperity. I
want to make the statement: Racism, not only in South Africa, but also
internationally, is not an end in itself. Who would pursue racism as an end
in itself. It can never be an end in itself.

It is much rather a symptom of a deeper underlying problem in a community
or a country, and that problem, inter alia, crops up in the form of racism.
The problem in South Africa, and this is my perception, is that the
constitutional recipe for South Africa is incorrect.]

We are only paying lip service to the recognition of different communities
and their interests and rights. One cannot build a nation by stumbling from
one sporting event to the next and then expect people to be enthusiastic
about nation-building and to feel accommodated and secure in that sense.

Daar is nie vandag baie gepraat oor die aanbevelings van die konferensie
nie. Ek wil stilstaan by een of twee van daardie punte met betrekking tot
die program van aksie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Not much has been said today about the recommendations of the conference.
I want to concentrate on one or two of those points relating to the
programme of action.]

Item 26 says, and I quote: ``... measures be adopted which would restore
and enhance the usage and recognition of diverse cultures ...'' It refers
to the whole question of section 185. Obviously that needs to be addressed.
We have been hearing from the Government for the last five years that that
issue will be addressed. Up to this day it is not being addressed. There
are many other examples that also need to be addressed. The fact of the
matter is: We will not get away from racism until we find a constitutional
dispensation that gives recognition to diversity in South Africa.
[Interjections.] That needs to be done. If we do not do that we will
continue to have problems in South Africa. [Time expired.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members, deracialising this country
should be accepted as a process. It is not a matter of switching it off or
on as if it was a light switch. People in this country must themselves be
committed to change and this goes for the former liberation movements as
well.

The Government has to take up where former President Mandela left off.
Nation-building was his passion as head of state, and it is not
unreasonable to expect his successor to strive to bring the cosmopolitan
population of South Africa closer to one another. It is also not
unreasonable to expect the same population to be amenable to
deracialisation. South Africans, particularly the Government, should
refrain from making subtle racial remarks and, on being called upon, saying
that people overreact and are spoilt brats. As a nation we should refrain
from reliving the past. Two wrongs do not make a right.

It is very unfortunate that racism is still alive and kicking in this
country. Imagine a situation where a man confined to a wheelchair, begging
for alms, accepts money from whites only, and if a black person makes an
offer he puts his hand over the top of the money box clearly indicating
that he will not accept help from blacks. This is as unbecoming as it is
annoying, because it will perpetuate polarisation among the people.

Racism is not prevalent between blacks and whites only. It is equally rife
among blacks who have names by which they call others who are not of their
group. Batswana have even gone to the extreme of having a noun class in
their language study in which they lump all people other than Sothos. Class
3, the le-/ma- class of their noun classes, is an example of the first
degree of racism. This should not be allowed to continue. There are
derogatory terms used by other African language speakers when they refer to
others too.

It sometimes boggles the mind when hon members in this House promulgate
legislation such as the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act of 2000, and do very little to conscientise the populace
on its content and significance. Government and Parliament should not be
seen as doing more talking than delivering.

The establishment of the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the
Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities is long overdue.
It is a body like this that can help in improving racial understanding and
tolerance and assist in ridding South Africa of xenophobia.

South Africa has to be a place for all people of goodwill under the sun.
May we look forward to the Third United Nations World Conference Against
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, which
will be hosted by South Africa next year!

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, racism is a cancer which is not easy to
eradicate. Its roots go deep into the mind and psyche of an individual,
community or nation. A person infected with racism cannot have a clear
vision or judgment. Racism attacks, corrupts and destroys the whole mind.

South Africa became well known worldwide because of apartheid. South Africa
was Balkanised in such a way that mere legislation cannot be a quick fix to
put us together. It is for this reason that the United Nations declared
apartheid a crime against humanity.

The World Council of Churches launched a programme to combat racism.
Preaching at the World Council of Churches Conference on racism, I appealed
to the World Council of Churches to adopt a programme to combat violence
and crime. This was adopted, and this year a programme of action will be
tabled before the churches of the world.

Racism, however, should continue to be roundly condemned. Racists should
not be allowed to walk tall in our society. They should be made to feel
guilty and rejected in a civilised society. Nonracialism should become the
norm, and we should work towards the ideal of one world, one human race and
one destiny.

As racism is a moral, ethical and theological problem, religious
institutions should take up the fight in their teaching, preaching,
worshipping and moral life.

The PAC supports the recommendations and the programme of action of the
Conference on Racism. The PAC calls on all schools to raise consciousness
in schools because pupils are in their formative years, and what they will
become in life is shaped at school. Schools that do not have a vision of a
nonracial society should be closed down. Racism should be eliminated in
places of work.

Racism feeds on greed. The antidote to greed and selfishness is the ethic
of sharing - the sharing of land, of wealth and of facilities. This should
be a national virtue, and schools should give trophies to pupils who excel
in this virtue. In the community and the nation, special recognition and
awards should be given. The consciousness of a common fatherland or
motherland with a common fate and future should be raised.

If we spend more money and time on this exercise, racism can be easily
eradicated. We wish the Third United Nations World Conference Against
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance to be
held next year every success.
Ms G L MAHLANGU: Madam Speaker, hon members, and ladies and gentlemen,
after the comment by Comrade Matthews about serious thinkers, I am not
going to comment about a number things that I had wanted to mention here.

When Patsy Tlakula from the Human Rights Commission heard the testimonies
given by people on the subject of racism, she said:


  I have been in this commission for five years. Through the media and
  complaints that reach us, I had a sense that the situation on the farms
  was very bad, but, yesterday, it was shocking - people have lost legs,
  eyes, and their ears have been bitten by dogs. It is just an awful
  situation of vicious attacks that are taking place on the farms. Besides
  attacks on the farms, there had been incidents of urban terrorism -
  marauding gangs of white people drive around in rural towns, looking for
  unsuspecting black people who are going about their business. They stop
  and attack.

Racism was entrenched as a device to rule over people whose ethical and
moral base was rooted in a trinity and spirituality and who believed in:
``Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu'' [A person is a person through other people].
Why else should we have committed ourselves to a nonracial society? Why
else should we have given birth to a new kind of culture with a
Constitution that outlaws racism? Jailed, exiled, banned or banished, we
smiled, though it was painful, for sustenance. Widowed or maimed, we
persevered and focused on spiritual inspiration. As hon Mawa Ramgobin would
say: ``I cannot be, if others are not.''

The extent to which the current political dispensation will be successful
will depend on our being able to manage the expectations of the black
population for an improved quality of life, on the one hand, and the white
negative fears, on the other. The central issue of these two separate
agendas is the distribution of opportunities, resources and status.

How do we address past imbalances and inequalities? Look at the attitude of
some people towards affirmative action. The hon Pallo Jordan, at the
instance of the racism conference, said the following:


  It is ridiculous to pretend that white and black South Africans are
  starting from the same starting line. They are not. The playing fields
  are far from level. All affirmative action is doing is trying to level
  the playing fields. It is not saying that the money in the bank which you
  have as a result of unearned rewards you had under apartheid will be
  taken away from you. It is just saying that we are levelling the playing
  fields, and that we are going to give each child running shoes. That is
  all, so that we can compete more or less equally. We know that the one
  kid whose parents have money in the bank because of unearned rewards of
  apartheid had better training. We know he has a better diet. He has all
  those things. We are not saying we are going to cancel out his training
  or we are going to give the other kid some steroids. We are just saying
  that everyone is going to have running shoes.

Today, in South Africa, nobody wants to own apartheid, despite the benefits
they derived from it. Our society uses skin colour as a prescriptive basis
of distributing status, privilege, opportunities and resources. Racism is
evil and immoral. This is a reality. Racism goes hand-in-hand with gender
discrimination. The ecumenical women's meeting on racism took place last
year, from 9 December 1999 to 14 December 1999. The resultant declaration
was:
  We declare that fullness of life in Christ and Christ's prayers for unity
  require the assurance of women's participation, the elimination of
  violence against women, and that the image of God in women be valued and
  recognised.

Furthermore, we declare that the fullness of life in Christ and Christ's
prayer for unity require that no race be valued higher than others.

We declare that racism and ethnocentrism are against the will of God and
have no place in God's household. As women and mothers, we envisage a world
where antiracist work becomes a priority and is built on a model of shared
leadership. Women are always at the receiving end of all these evil systems
and practices.

Mosadi ke motshwara-thipa ka fa bogaleng. Le fa le ka mo lebala, la
motlodisa matlho, mosadi ke mmelega mafatshe le dit[s]haba. Kgatelelo ya
bomme e tliswa ke kgetelelo ya merafe le batho gareng ga bona. (Translation
of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[A woman is a pillar of strength. Even if one ignores and embarrasses her
in front of others, a woman will carry the weight of the world on her
shoulders. Women are oppressed by nations and people who rule them.]

There is a need for a common agenda and a collective social memory of the
future. The first step in this direction is to negotiate a shared common
agenda through compromise, patience and reconciliation. The tragic reality
of South Africa is that we tend not to have a sense of national identity.
We think of ourselves as black or white.

The new South Africa is where the white minority owns the economy, while
the black majority runs the politics and has a living memory of three
centuries of oppression - what a volatile brew! I will refer hon members to
a giant of the times and well-known reggae singer, Bob Marley, when he
said:


  Who the cap fits, let him wear it.

We have seen them wearing the cap this afternoon! How many pieces of
legislation were voted against when it was clear that the lives of the
ordinary people were going to improve? Thanks to the majority in the ANC,
all those Bills were voted for and we managed to pass them.

That has to change. We should listen to the African drum. We all cried
here. Those hon members who followed Comrade Thabo Mbeki when he said: ``I
am an African'', all said that they were Africans. One cannot be an African
without ubuntu. [Interjections.] Ubuntu can play a creative role in
rebuilding social relationships that have divided society. Ubuntu can help
us to be reconciled.

Today black people are extending a hand of reconciliation, and the masters
of apartheid and racism behave as if it is business as usual. They know
that they benefited. We never heard their voice against apartheid and
against the banishment of our comrades. Even in this province, where more
than 3 million Africans were forcibly removed to the Eastern Cape, I never
heard the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk or the hon Tony Leon shouting.
[Interjections.] We do expect them to be ashamed, but not to defend an evil
system like apartheid and racism. [Interjections.] They should deal with
their guilt, accept their wrongs, own up and make up. No amount of denial
will heal them.

For racism to be eliminated, we have to start somewhere. We have a powerful
Constitution. Should we not start at the genesis of the current problem?
Should the white land-owning South Africans not address the issue of land
dispossession? Do they not feel the moral need to share? Should they not
share their scientific knowledge to conduct good farming with their fellow
African compatriots? What voluntary efforts are being made by the current
white holders of 87% of the land? Hardly any. [Interjections.]

What are their expectations to the landless people? Should not more than
normal efforts be made by the beneficiaries of apartheid to help educate
and train people who were victims of apartheid and the notorious Bantu
education? Should they not be seen to be engaged - with the power of
Government on their side - actively on the ground, fighting crime and
violence in the townships and everywhere else? I said that whoever the cap
fits, should wear it, and they are doing exactly that. Thanks to Bob
Marley. [Interjections.] As South Africans, we need to transform our
country together. We can and we must become a united and great nation. Yes,
we are diverse in our cultures, but we can and must build our unity in the
fullness of our diversity. This is a richness that we have.

With regard to our efforts at reconciliation, we are the envy of the world.
Those hon members should not tarnish this, and they should not harp on
racial minority interests. They should join the majority of South Africans
who are black, deprived and dispossessed. They should fight their poverty
and not their skin colour. They should help in all and every way possible
to create conditions of good health, both physical and mental. We are not a
poor country. We can afford to live together in harmony. The hon Wally
Serote sums it up correctly when he says:


  I ask for our want to make life magic. Since it is so brief, since it is
  so loved, since it is so unquestionably rare,
  can't it be shared.

When the HRC consulted ordinary people on the ground in preparation for the
Conference on Racism, they did so because they needed to break the
conspiracy of silence that is prevalent in all discussions about racism.

At one level, silence is caused by fear of victimisation and intimidation.
Silence is also evasive in denial in the case of those who do not wish to
be challenged about racist practices. They pretend they do not understand
what we are talking about. They make the kind of noises that are being
made. They demand definitions and make countercharges. There is generally a
paradigm of denial by those who have power and who are not prepared to
allow themselves to be confronted with the reality and effects of racist
action.

``What we received as a result went well beyond our expectations.'' This
was said by Barney Pityana, when his colleague Patsy Tlakula found
testimonies given by people most traumatic.

If one scratches below the surface, many white South Africans function with
suspicion, and I think that should end. We are faced with a huge problem
which can and will only be addressed through honesty and commitment to
eradicating all forms of racism. We owe it to ourselves, our children and
generations to come. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, I will get to the issues raised by the hon Gwen
Mahlangu later in my speech. [Interjections.] We are supposed to be
debating this grand-sounding document today, the South African Millennium
Statement on Racism and Programme of Action. There is not very much in it.
There is nothing in it which demonstrates the monstrous racism which the
President considered so compelling a national problem that he called a
multimillion rand conference at the opening of Parliament on 4 February
here.

The document fails to demonstrate that racism, rather than poverty or poor
administration, is the real problem six years into our transition. It is
one of our problems, certainly, but it cannot be used to explain away the
other problems. Only three of the 15 points under the programme of action
really address race. Four of the 15 call for the declaration of days,
decades, dialogue and a movement against racism, rather than a movement
against Government or a movement against Gear, of course, or globalisation.
Two points deal with reparation, one international and the other local.

The Government is urged to address reparations for victims of racism, as
recommended by the TRC report of 1998. But TRC reparations are not, of
course, for victims of racism. They are the legal quid pro quo for the
amnesties granted to perpetrators from all sides of the conflicts of the
past, as a result of which victims cannot claim damages.
Let me remind members, if I may, that the origins of the TRC itself lie, in
fact, in the heartbreaking stories of abuse by the ANC as told to its own
commission, the Skweyiya commission. The commission ordered compensation.
The ANC decided instead that there should be a ``commission of truth'' for
national disclosure of violations, which would use state funds to
compensate victims across the board. Seven years and one month later the
ANC is still avoiding the issue.

Point 25 wants us to ratify a few more international instruments, none of
which deals with race. There are two points which deal admirably with
xenophobia and cultural diversity, two of the so-called related forms of
intolerance.

Finally, before I get to race, there is one other related point which is
close to my heart and on which I petitioned Dr Pityana.

An HON MEMBER: It is about time you got to the point.

Ms M SMUTS: Well, it is about time the document got to the subject. That is
the point. [Interjections.]
Here I can see that the Human Rights Commission tried but failed to get
this point past the Government. This is what I petitioned Dr Pityana on. I
argued that the Government's effective abandonment of women on the Aids
issue constitutes discrimination as defined in both the convention on race,
the ICEAD, and the one on women, Cedaw.

We know that research project after research project shows that South
African women suffer sexual coercion on an enormous scale, with violence
impossibly high by international, including African, comparisons. Women are
nevertheless denied antiretrovirals after rape, or before birth, despite
the fact that the drugs are offered to us for next to nothing. I know the
subject was quietly raised at the conference. I know it was. But I have to
say that if point 23 is the result, then it falls hopelessly short. I
assume each hon member has the document. Point 23 is the result.

There was a time when we all spoke the same language here and in the two
constitution-making processes. Racism and sexism sit side-by-side in our
Constitution because the effects of centuries of prejudice and
condescension were directly comparable for women and for blacks. They boil
down to ``distinction, exclusion and restriction'' to use the definition
from the two conventions.

Women and people of colour also know what it is to have internalised an
assigned inferior status, and we know how to help each other reject that by
building confidence. However, these are the psychological or social
aspects. All of us clearly understood how one should deal with these
matters constitutionally, in the law and in policy.

Firstly, one repeals discriminatory law. Incidentally, the Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development reported on Tuesday
that the Black Administration Act of 1927, cornerstone of the previous
dispensation, remains unreviewed six years into this dispensation. The
committee has suggested that the Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Development, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture
and Land Affairs should get their act together.

Secondly, one prohibits unfair discrimination, but the Promotion of
Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act is not yet in effect.
Thirdly, one institutes affirmative action or corrective programmes and
yes, we support them and we always have. [Interjections.] It is the ANC's
... [Interjections.] Hon members should please listen. It is the ANC's
africanisation, masquerading as affirmative action, that we oppose.
[Interjections.] Hon members should go back to their own election manifesto
of 1994 if they want to see what affirmative action used to mean.
[Interjections.]

The Constitution and the law still speak that language, and so does the
Constitutional Court. Judge Albie Sachs calls it a structured focus on
nondiscrimination, as the heart of implementable equality guarantees. I
hope that Parliament still speaks that language and today's largely quiet
debate indicates that it does.

Government, however, does not. The Human Rights Commission does not. They
have slid deep into what the Human Rights Commission calls ``social
analysis rather than mere legal certainties'' and from there into the realm
of ``the deep recesses of one's consciousness''. That is what the HRC
called it in the media racism report.

Law and policy can deal with conduct, not the content of people's thoughts,
opinions, beliefs and free expression. However, both the HRC and the
executive have, over the last year, dragged debate down to the level of
allegations, of subliminal prejudice and hatred and, yes, it surfaced at
the conference too. [Interjections.] One can only surmise that there was
not enough demonstrable, concrete, conduct-based proof of the white racism
that the ANC apparently needs to protect a bitterly unpopular new elite and
to survive electorally. [Interjections.]

If anti-racism training in schools and in the public and private sectors,
as proposed here in point 11, means the kind of treatment the media got
from the HRC, we say ``no''. If it means what Prof Jakes Gerwel calls the
``conventions of civility'' and an appreciation of diversity, then,
``yes''.

It is a tragedy to see the ANC of Mandela and Luthuli turn into a race-
driven nationalist party. [Interjections.] I do not think that that extends
to all the members here. [Interjections.] Perhaps that is why many of them
are not here. Let us, hon members, get back on track with the transition.
[Interjections.]

In truth, we started exactly when the United Nations' decade on racism
commenced in 1993. Instead of declaring a new decade which starts now and
covers the next two general elections, let us complete the United Nations'
decade. We started in 1993; let us get on with unfinished business.
[Interjections.]

Point 21 asks that the disparities in wealth, land reform, access to
capital and skill, be addressed. Yes, get on with it. Government does not
need a race conference or a programme to fulfil these obligations. Point 29
asks for the implementation of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of
Discrimination Act. Get on with it. Let the courts adjudicate without
special ministerial preparation and designation.

Reconciliation is not a new process, as Prof Gerwel has said, as opposed to
our President who speaks of the danger of social instability implicit in
our race divisions. There has been a systematic drive to polarise this
country into black and white. Little wonder that the case against gender
discrimination, which cuts across colour, has become so muted. Both the
President and the ANC have said that whites think blacks are primitive,
pagan, savage and satanic. That is shocking.
The President told South Africa at the conference that one cannot expect
blacks to distinguish between whites who supported apartheid and the few
who did not. By design, or effectively, he has been driving the concept of
collective guilt which we specifically excluded from the TRC's Act and in
the interim Constitution.

Yes, I know what the President said here last week, but that has not
stopped the hon Gwen Mahlangu from driving the same line of argument today.
I know what he said last week, but the harm has been done. We need look no
further than the statements of the PAC in its pamphlet - Stanley should
take note - and from the provincial secretary this past weekend, namely,
``One oppressor, one bullet!'' One needs look no further than that to see
how dangerous this polarising approach has been.

There is white racism in this country. There is black racism in this
country. [Interjections.] There is tribalism. The Constitution created by
all of us here together recognises that fact and deals with it. It also
deals with the legacy of apartheid. Why the pretence? Why pretend?
Everybody is in denial? [Interjections.] Why deny the Constitution?
[Interjections.] [Time expired.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, at last democracy has given us the freedom
to speak. Racism in South Africa did not cease with the demise of the
apartheid regime in 1994. Redressing the inequalities of the past and
redistributing resources to the historically disadvantaged is still met
with hostility by certain privileged minority groups who want to retain the
economic status quo.

The primary aim of the conference on racism was to address the truth that
racism in South Africa still exists and that collective efforts must be
made to eliminate personal acts of racism and the apartheid system which
internalised racism in people. The political parties are graced with power
to transform the electorate and promote the principle of the rainbow
nation, instead of politicising every issue that affects either black or
white, thus creating the zebra nation. Propagandanistic fight-backs belong
to the apartheid regime and not in the current democratic era.

What are we fighting? Six years of democracy is fighting back against
approximately 350 years of oppression by the colonial government.
Constructive opposition is the key to progress. In the 1999 national
election the DP and the New NNP trampled each other for the Indian vote.
Yet, when the DP won seven seats in the provincial legislature in KwaZulu-
Natal, it gave six to the whites and one to the blacks. The MF nagged the
DP for cheating the Indian voters in the 1999 national election. Finally in
July, when a white MPP, Mr Wessel Nel, resigned, the DP appointed an Indian
MPP, Mr Gobodi from Estcourt.

This is another political stunt executed by the DP just before the local
elections to manipulate the Indian vote. The MF predominantly represents
Indian communities with the objective of uniting them with the majority.
Unlike other parties we do not use other race groups as scapegoats to
protect our interest.  The MF will not apologise for our blatant honesty.

Mahatma Ghandi was the first political leader to bridge the Indo-African
relationship. Likewise, the MF is following in his footsteps by forming an
alliance with the majority party. Although the apartheid government
desperately tried to sever the relationship between the majority and the
Indians, something which was evidently contrived in the 1949 riots, the
Inanda riot of 1985 in KwaZulu-Natal and the Group Areas Act, Indians
stubbornly chose to be at the forefront of the freedom struggle.
The MF will not allow former white political parties to indoctrinate black
fear into the Indians. The MF is the only political party which has the
guts to openly admit that we want to reconcile the Indians with the
majority. The answer to economic, social and political development is to co-
operate and maintain a close working relationship with the ruling party.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mevrou die Speaker, as ek na die Ordelys kyk, sien ek die
onderwerp van bespreking is ``Recommendations of Conference on Racism''.
Met die uitsondering van my kleinniggie Dene Smuts het nie een van die
sprekers hulle daarby gehou nie. Dit lyk of ons ons eie konferensie wil
oorhou asof daar nie reeds een gehou is nie. Ek dink nie een van die
sprekers het eens die verslag gelees voor hulle hul toesprake geskryf het
nie, soos die dominee wat sy preek opstel en agterna die gespaste teks
soek. Ek wil my probeer bepaal by die verslag self. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, when I look at the Order Paper I see that the
subject under discussion is ``Recommendations of Conference on Rascism''.
With the exception of my grandniece Dene Smuts, not one of the speakers
confined themselves to the topic. It would seem as if we want to hold our
own conference as if one had not already been held. I doubt whether any of
the speakers even read the report before they wrote their speeches, like
the clergyman who prepares his sermon and only then looks for the
appropriate text. I want to try to confine myself to the report itself.]

I can call it a mild report of a vicious conference. In his opening speech
at the conference, President Mbeki expressed confidence that South Africans
have wisdom, ingenuity and sensitivity to the human condition to overcome
racism. Although the conference was more often than not not marked by this
sensitivity, the report itself fares a little better in this respect.

There are still some concerns that I would like to deal with. The report
explains its solidarity with the refugees who are flocking to South Africa
without warning against the danger of the indiscriminate influx of
foreigners. This very tendency will further destroy our country, and the
fact that these foreigners are taking up the limited work and jobs
available in South Africa will definitely contribute to more racism and,
perhaps, justified xenophobia.

The report has the tendency to credit apartheid with all the evils that are
present in South Africa without explaining why the same inequalities exist
in countries of the same nature as South Africa, which did not have a
policy like that.

The report asks that the criminal justice system be equipped to apply the
provisions of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act. Somewhere, there is a bit of a slip-up. The Promotion
of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act does not operate in
the sphere of criminal law, but that of civil law.

In line with the President's plea for sensitivity, the AEB makes a plea for
sensitivity for the fact that 16 December is, for a large part of the
Afrikaner community, a day with specific religious content and will, in our
hearts, always be the Day of the Covenant. We appeal for some sensitivity
towards that.

Die AEB verwelkom punt 26 van die verslag, wat aanbeveel dat maatreëls
getref word om die erkenning van die verskeidenheid taal-, kultuur- en
godsdiensgemeenskappe aan te moedig en te bevorder, en deel ook die verslag
se kommer dat daardie kommissie nog nie ingestel is nie. Ek dink die
konferensie het lippediens hieraan bewys, en die illusie van 'n
allesomvattende eenkleurnasie is die oorheersende indruk van die
konferensie.

Dit is ironies dat die konferensie oor die regte van taal-, kultuur- en
godsdiensgemeenskappe hierdie jaar onverklaarbaar genoeg nie eens
plaasgevind het nie. Die AEB deel die kommer van die Mynwerkersunie dat die
trant van die konferensie eerder tot rassespanning en polarisering
aanleiding gegee het. Die ontkenning dat daar ook neigings tot rassisme by
ander gemeenskappe is, het die konferensie in 'n eensydige inkwisisie laat
ontaard. Ek sluit af. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The AEB welcomes point 26 of the report, which recommends that measures be
taken to encourage and to promote the recognition of the diversity of
linguistic, cultural and religious communities, and also shares the concern
expressed in the report that that commission has not yet been established.
I think the conference paid lip service to this, and the illusion of a
comprehensive one-colour-nation is the overriding impression of the
conference.

It is ironic that the conference on the rights of linguistic, cultural and
religious communities did not even take place this year for some
inexplicable reason. The AEB shares the concern of the Mineworkers' Union
that the manner in which the conference was conducted actually gave rise to
racial tension and polarisation. The denial of the fact that there is also
a tendency to racism in other communities caused the conference to
degenerate into a one-sided inquisition. I wish to conclude.]

I hope that the milder touch reflected in the report, despite its flaws, is
an indication that a more positive and inclusive approach will be taken
than that taken at the conference. [Time expired.]

Mr M A MANGENA: Chairperson, there is no doubt that the national conference
on racism, held in Sandton recently, was a historic and important event in
our country. The conference focused national attention on the scourge of
racism that affects millions of our people every day on farms, in private
homes, banks, insurance companies, supermarkets, the army, the Police
Service and everywhere. Occasionally, it erupts into something that hits
the headlines like when a man is painted silver or another one is tied
behind a bakkie and dragged for several kilometres until he is dead and
pieces of his flesh are collected like samples of mud on the tar road.

Racism is an irrational disease that destroys human relations and is
capable of shaking the very foundations of a society or a country. We have
experience in this country of the consequences of racial discrimination and
racist practices. The programme of action adopted by the conference, which
includes the declaration of a decade of national mobilisation against
racism, is most welcome. Racism will not just go away of its own accord. It
needs to be confronted and rooted out of the fabric of our society.

The incessant complaints of racism emanating from blacks, and the fact that
they are at the receiving end of racist practices everywhere, is a measure
of the weakness of the blacks. Only the weak can complain of being
discriminated against or being oppressed. Women complain of being oppressed
socially and economically, because they are in a weak position at this
point in time. Blacks do not complain of discrimination in soccer or
politics because they are on an equal footing with everybody.

We are ill-treated, beaten up and evicted from farms because we own very
little land. We complain of racist discrimination in banking, insurance,
commerce and industry because our ownership stake in these sectors is
almost zero. We complain about being discriminated against in rugby,
cricket and other such sporting codes because other people are in a more
powerful position in these areas.

An HON MEMBER: Bua ntate! [Tell them, sir!]

Mr M A MANGENA: We are put in this position of weakness by a history of
colonisation, discrimination and oppression, spanning several centuries. Be
that as it may, blacks must guard against being a nation of moaners. We
should guard against entrenching a victim mentality in our general psyche.

Yes, we should complain against and talk about racism when and wherever we
encounter it, but, above all, instances of racist discrimination against us
should galvanise us into action. That action must be geared at raising our
economic and social status.

Journalist Mathatha Tsedu ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, when I came up here, I came as a sweeper. I am
supposed to sweep and pick up on some of the points that people have raised
here.

I must say that I would be spoiling the little bit of dignity that we have
been able to give this debate, if I were to respond. So I apologise to my
comrades here and say that I am not even going to waste my time responding
to some of the points, because I think that would not do justice to the
issue.

However, let me say that the ugly face of racism was not about which bus
one could travel on or which toilet one could use, in the past. It was
about the horrible consequences that this had on the lives of people, which
led to the poverty, the shacks and the high unemployment in the black
communities. That is what racism was about. Although the legal basis is now
removed, the effects of that system, prior to 1994, are still deeply
entrenched in many areas in South African society.
In my view, our single biggest challenge is to build a new South African
nation - a South African nation that can pool all its skills, its talents
and its resources to overcome crime and unemployment and to make our
economy grow, a rainbow nation that can accommodate the very diverse
religious, cultural and language differences in our country. However, the
reality is that we do have very distinct groups. Whether we call these
groups nations or communities, we have two very distinct groups in our
country. We have what is referred to as broadly black aspirations and
expectations on the one side, and white fears on the other side. We might
define this differently, but we all have to agree that that is one of the
characteristics of South African society currently.

My problem, however, is that we have, for too long, tried to convince one
another of the views of either the one group or the other, and that we have
not made a lot of progress with respect to the solutions to the problems.
If we are unable to see things through the eyes of the other group, we will
be coming up with the wrong solutions. We have to ask ourselves: What is it
that the other group sees as the major problems to them, and what do they
see as possible solutions? We are all convinced that we are right in our
approach, but are we? That is the question that we should be asking.

I would like to share a small experience that I have had with hon members.
My daughter was cutting my hair in the bathroom. [Interjections.] Yes, I
have a daughter old enough to cut my hair. For those hon members who think
I am a youngster, I am 51 years old. My wife came in while my daughter was
cutting my hair and said to me that I must please make sure that I vacuum
up all the hair after my daughter had finished. [Interjections.]

So I agreed, and after my daughter had cut my hair I took the vacuum
cleaner and cleaned up as best as I could. I looked around, and it looked
clean to me. My wife popped into the bathroom and she said: ``I asked you
so nicely to vacuum up all the hair, and look what the place looks like!
``I looked around and I could not see what she was talking about.
[Laughter.] I really could not. So for the hell of it I put on my
spectacles, and I was shocked. I saw how much hair was still on the floor.
[Laughter.]

The point that I am trying to demonstrate here is that I was convinced that
I was right, that I had cleaned the floor completely. In fact, I made sure
because I did not want my wife to tell me that I had not done a proper job.
However, the reality is that even though I was convinced I was right, I was
wrong, because I did not put on my spectacles.

I have used a very ordinary example, because sometimes these examples are
easier to understand. However, the point that I am trying to get across
here is that we need to start looking through the spectacles or the eyes of
other people, and not just look at things from where we come from and from
what we see. It is something that we should learn, not just from me, but in
general from other people when we are confronted with issues like that.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

Now I have got my spectacles on, you see, so I can see things from both
sides, hopefully. [Laughter.] However, let me use another example. When we
talk about the inequalities, many people are saying that apartheid was
wrong. We have heard that nobody voted for apartheid, because of their
reply whenever you ask them: ``Was apartheid wrong? Did you support it?''
[Interjections.] So it is a very strange phenomenon that nobody voted for
it, but that it was around for so long. [Laughter.]

However, people say that one should not speak about apartheid, because that
was in the past. However, we are talking about the consequences of
apartheid. I want to demonstrate that with another example. A person is
sitting in his home and somebody comes in. They chat, and the one whose
house it is, is cleaning his gun.

Mr K M ANDREW: Is it a licensed gun?

Mr M S MANIE: Madam Speaker, it might be licensed if it is that hon
member's. If it is mine, it is not. [Laughter.] So he is cleaning the gun,
and it goes off accidentally. The visitor is fatally wounded. While the
person is bleeding it is not good enough for the owner of the house to
say:``I am sorry that I accidentally shot you'', and want to walk away.
What we need to do is to deal with the effects of the system. If we had
knowledge that apartheid was wrong, we have to see what we can do to stop
the bleeding. That is the responsibility of us all. [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Let me also say that if we are all saying that, then that is exactly the
problem. We should not all be saying that; we should all be doing it. There
is a big difference between saying that apartheid is wrong and doing
something about it. We have all been saying that and we do nothing. We must
get into the mode of doing and not talking. I think that is what we need in
our country, and it is not because one is white or black. All of us should
see it as our collective responsibility.

I want to say that there are many white people who have the desire to be
part of the new South Africa. We met with the SA Agricultural Union not so
long ago, and I must say that I was very impressed by the honest desire
that they showed to find out what they should be doing and how we should be
starting consultations and discussions so that we could start working
together to deal with problems, not only with regard to farmers, but also
about farmworkers.

When we talk about the bosses, we also need to talk about the problems of
the workers. If we talk about things from one perspective only, we are not
going to find solutions. We need, in fact, as a nation, to start dealing
with things in a more balanced way. Then we will start finding solutions
quicker.

I also want to say that if we are saying that there are many white people
who have the desire to be part of the new South Africa, one must then
understand, at the same time, that black people are not angry and bitter.
All they desire in the new South Africa is to be part of the new South
Africa and benefit from it by having a better quality of life, and that
means that everybody must assist them to get there.

I can talk about these things forever, but this little thing is telling me
that my time is almost up. But before I am told that my time is up, I just
want to conclude on a lighter note by saying that now that Abe Williams is
no longer a member of the House, I am now transferring the responsibility
of getting my father's pension to the DP. [Laughter.] I hope that Douglas
Gibson will be given that message. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairman, I am
happy that we are having this discussion, and I am also happy that we are
so passionate about the subject, though, of course, we are passionate from
diverse angles.

Maybe I should start with my old friend, Rev Meshoe. Rev Meshoe knows the
story of Nicodemus better than I do. He asked, according to the Bible, what
he should do to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Of course, Rev Meshoe knows
the answer. He never said that the answer was Miracle 2000. [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

But, seriously though, my mother, who was a charwoman, ``unomakhishini'' -
I come from the womb of such a level of cheap labour - used to say to me as
a small boy: ``It is only women who know and who have experienced the
labour pains and the pangs of childbirth.'' If one has never been a victim
of the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts; if one has never had one's freedom of
movement restricted in any way whatsoever; if one has never in one's life
experienced being a kaffir, a coolie, ``ikula''; if one has never
experienced being a ``hotnot'' in one's life, the most one can do is to
sympathise with those who have and show solidarity with them. [Applause.]
But one should never come to this House to denounce them when they say:
``But, for God's sake, there is a problem in this country.''

When one goes out to a place called Vryburg now and asks them in the middle
of the street, ``Is there racism?'' the masses are going to say, ``Yes,
there is racism.'' When one goes to other parts of the country, even in
Bryanston in Johannesburg, and sees the little boy who was attacked by
white thugs and nearly lost an eye, and asks him,'' Why did this happen to
you?'' he will say, ``It is because of my race.''

For God's sake! My daughter, an 11-year-old, who was born in exile, says to
me: ``Daddy, we live in a place where there is a preponderance of whites,
but when we go out to Soweto, where you claim to have grown up, we do not
see whites. Why is that the case?'' Again one cannot lie to this child and
say that this is a God-given order. [Laughter.] Those ghettos were created
by fellow human beings, and deliberately so.

It is a shame that some people are mourning the so-called demise of the ANC
of Luthuli, Mandela, etc because those selfsame people were responsible for
the banning order that was slapped on that ANC, and at that moment they
never mourned their own action against the ANC. [Applause.] But more than
that, is it not time for us to step back and say that, whatever we may
think of Helen Suzman, she was totally different from this motley
collection of people who claim that they are her followers.
[Interjections.] She is completely different from them.

As a black South African with my experience of white racism, I have no
apology for being passionate about racism in this country. Racism is an
international problem, and that is why the world is gathering in this
country next year to discuss it. In the meantime, people pretend that six
years down the line since the demise of apartheid, racism has disappeared
in the country. It has not, for God's sake. It is a daily experience of
ordinary people. When one sees, for instance, in the whites-only streets of
some of the suburbs, a black in the back of a white man's bakkie and a dog
sitting next to the white man in the cab on a rainy day, what does one make
of that? Is it not racism to prefer to sit with a dog to sitting with a
human being? It still happens, and it is the experience of our own people.

By the way, 55 years after the end of the Second World War we still
acknowledge that there was indeed a holocaust; we do not deny this. Yet
when we say that the consequences of apartheid are there and are staring us
in the face, people say, ``No, you are dividing this nation.'' This
surprises us. After all, we have never been united, we still have to build
one nation in this country, and we will not build it by magic or by
pretending that the past never happened. We will have to build it
consciously and go all out to build it.

The question is: What are the leaders of the opposition offering to unravel
our past which stares us in the face? That is a critical question.
[Applause.] One cannot run away from that one. The answer, for God's sake,
is not as simple as saying, ``You are in government, so do it.'' It is as
though they are saying, ``You took over from us, and therefore you are to
blame for the consequences of a past that you never created.'' That is a
wrong attitude. It is the moment now for all of us as serious and honest
leaders to say: What is it that we can do to create this society that we
have committed ourselves to in the Constitution? We all profess to be
nonracial and nonsexist in our orientation.

We all profess to be committed to the emergence of a democratic society
based on the basic values that we all incorporated in our Constitution. But
what do we do beyond that point? Again, as the old English adage goes,
actions speak louder than words. They speak louder. What is it that we are
all doing? Is it really preferable for some of them to say, ``No, let this
Government do it.'' Then they put up all sorts of sickening posters in
whites-only areas, or predominantly white areas, with slogans, such as
``Resist high rates!'' But why do they not put them up in Soweto? They do
not exist there. I know they do not. They do not have those posters there.

The reason they are not doing it is simple. [Interjections.] Please listen.
The reason they are not doing it ... [Interjections.] Hon members should
please listen; they have got ears, unless of course their ears are not
connected to whatever savvy they are supposed to have. [Laughter.] They
should listen. The reason they will not do this is because they are
preoccupied with protecting the rich. They are the ones who must not be
taxed in order that we may use whatever we rake in by way of taxes to
resolve those problems.

How else can we do it if we do not take certain measures to transfer
resources from where they currently reside in racial terms?
[Interjections.] This is it. This House was actually told an untruth this
afternoon, namely that we tax on a racial basis. We do not. Cyril
Ramaphosa, who is as black as I am, pays as high taxation as he does
because he belongs to those people who do have. He has achieved something
and there are many like that. But those hon members say that people should
not pay these high rates; because - and this is what they ought to be
saying to complete the statement which reflects their state of mind - if
they do, this Government will take their money and use it where it was
never used before. [Interjections.]

I have said the ghettos never created themselves. [Interjections.] No, for
God's sake, Dene should listen. The ghettos never created themselves. There
never was a Soweto until some white people sitting in this institution
created it. That is it. Yes! [Interjections.] Now what are they offering as
a solution? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

The MINISTER: Look they are in denial mode. That is the problem. They
should be saying ``The past was awful, this is what we will do, together
with the Government.'' We do not even want their phony apology.
[Interjections.] What we want is their honest action to deal with the past.
[Applause.] They are not as yet grappling with that past. Instead they are
seeking a reassurance that indeed things that have to be done are not going
to be done. They are even afraid of affirmative action. [Interjections.]
They are afraid of it. Does the hon member practise it? Does the hon member
practise it? [Interjections.] Where? For God's sake, they had centuries to
do it. They had 46 years of apartheid to do it. They sat here to our
exclusion. They never did it. They cannot do it now. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
    CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON LIMITATION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
                        GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS BILL

Order disposed of without debate.

Report adopted.

        INSTITUTION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST ORGANS OF STATE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairman, the
Bill that lies before the House has a long history. On 3 October 1985 the
SA Law Commission reported to the then Minister of Justice on its
investigation into time limits for the institution of actions against the
state. That was, Project 42. The SA Law Commission recommended, among other
things: the repeal or amendment of several provisions which limited the
institution of actions against Government institutions or persons for whose
actions Government institutions were liable in law; uniform provisions for
such actions in terms whereof the defendant, that is the Government or a
Government institution, had to be notified in writing of intended
proceedings within six months after the debt became due; and that the usual
requirements for prescription should apply to the debts of Government
institutions.

The recommendations of the SA Law Commission were encompassed in a draft
Bill, but, presumably because of objections by certain Government
institutions, that Bill was never introduced into Parliament. However, in
the light of legislative changes that have taken place since 1985, and the
reasoning in the case of Mohlomi v Minister of Defence, where the
Constitutional Court held that section 113(1) of the Defence Act of 1957,
which provided for limitations of actions against the Defence Force, was
constitutionally invalid, the SA Law Commission submitted a Supplementary
Report on the Investigation into Time Limits for the Institution of Actions
against the State to the previous Minister of Justice on 30 September 1998.


The Limitation of Legal Proceedings against Government Institutions Bill of
2000, which emanated from that report, was eventually introduced into
Parliament on 25 November 1999. The Portfolio Committee on Justice and
Constitutional Development, having considered the Bill and the submissions
received in respect thereof, presented the Bill which is before the House
today, namely the Institution of Legal Proceedings against Organs of State
Bill of 2000.

Because the objects of the respective clauses of the Bill are dealt with
comprehensively in the memorandum on the objects of the Bill, I do not find
it necessary to discuss or to give a detailed explanation of these clauses.
I will rather use this opportunity to briefly highlight the necessity and
desirability of statutory provisions of the kind contained in the Bill.

There are at present several statutory provisions which regulate the right
of a person to institute legal proceedings against certain organs of state,
for example, the SA Police Service and the Public Service, for the recovery
of certain debts. The majority of these provisions provide that the
creditor or plaintiff must give the organ of state concerned notice of his
or her intention to institute legal proceedings against that organ of
state, and that a certain period of time must elapse from the date of the
notice before such legal proceedings may be instituted.

Provision is further made for the lapse of the right to institute such
legal proceedings after the expiry of certain fixed periods, calculated
from the date when the cause of action arose. The periods allowed for the
issuing of a notice, and the expiry periods differ from one statute to
another, and this creates uncertainty that is aggravated by the uncertainty
about the constitutionality of each different provision. In the light of
the above, the principal object of the Bill is to harmonise and create
uniformity in respect of the existing laws pertaining to notice periods for
the institution of legal proceedings against organs of state.
Regarding the origin of such, let us call them restrictive, provisions, it
was pointed out in the SA Law Commission's 1985 report that the position
regarding state liability was not clear in the Roman and Roman-Dutch law.
However, between 1888 and 1903 laws were passed in the Cape, Natal, Free
State and Transvaal to lay down the principle clearly that the state was
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts. Provisions providing for
specific expiry periods and requirements of notice followed shortly
thereafter.

Regarding the necessity and desirability of notice requirements as
envisaged by the Bill, the Constitutional Court in the Mohlomi case made,
inter alia, the following remarks:


  An insistence on notices of the kind required by section 113(1) is by no
  means peculiar to the particular proceedings that it governs. Similar
  conditions precedent to the institution of actions are, and have long
  been, familiar features of our statutory terrain, especially the part
  occupied by departments of state, provincial administrations and local
  authorities once they become prospective defendants. The conventional
  explanation for demanding prior notification of any intention to sue such
  an organ of Government is that, with its extensive activities and large
  staff, which tends to shift, it needs the opportunity to investigate
  claims laid against it, to consider them responsibly and to decide,
  before getting embroiled in litigation at public expense, whether it
  ought to accept, reject or endeavour to settle them.

The court continues:


  Rules that limit the time during which litigation may be launched are
  common in our legal system as well as many others. Inordinate delays in
  litigating damage the interests of justice. They protract the disputes
  over the rights and obligations sought to be enforced, prolonging the
  uncertainty of all concerned about their affairs. Nor, in the end, is it
  always possible to adjudicate satisfactorily on cases that have gone
  stale. By then, witnesses may no longer be available to testify. The
  memories of one whose testimony can still be obtained may have faded and
  become unreliable. Documentary evidence may have disappeared. Such rules
  prevent procrastination and the harmful consequences of it. They, thus,
  serve a purpose to which no exception in principle can cogently be taken.

Further arguments that could be raised in support of the provisions of the
Bill, and which have already been raised in the SA Law Commission's 1985
report, are, amongst others, the following. Organs of the state are obliged
by law to follow cautious and sometimes cumbersome procedures. Organs of
state operate on an annual budget and must be notified of possible claims
as soon as possible. Organs of state need time to deliberate and consider
questions of policy and the possibility of settlements. If a settlement can
be arrived at, unnecessary costs are saved. Organs of state act in the
public interest and not for gain. Certain organs of state are obliged by
law to render services in the public interest which expose them to actions.
Because public funds are involved, organs of state must guard against
unfounded claims.

I am aware that, over the years, some judges have drawn attention to the
adverse effect on claimants of requirements like those provided for in the
Bill. Mr Justice Innes then a judge of the Appellate Division, described
them in Benning v Union Government as ``conditions which clog the ordinary
right of an aggrieved person to seek the assistance of a court of law''. In
Avex Air v Borough of Vryheid, Mr Justice Botha, then a judge of the
Appellate Division, referred to them as ``hampering as it does the ordinary
rights of an aggrieved person to seek the assistance of the courts''.

I also realise that certain counterarguments could also be raised against
the provisions of the Bill. For example, organs of state are not the only
defendants who have extensive activities and a fluctuating workforce. Large
companies experience the same problems, but do not enjoy special
protection. Although it is in the public interest that public funds should
not be wasted, it is also in the public interest that well-founded claims
should not fail as a result of strict procedural requirements.

Although these counterarguments may be valid, I am of the opinion, and I
think that members of this House will agree with me, that when the pros and
cons of the provisions of the Bill are considered, one can come to no other
conclusion than that the advantages of those provisions far outweigh any
disadvantage which they may have. I also agree with the Constitutional
Court's remark in the Mohlomi case that rules that limit the time during
which litigation may be launched, such as the provisions of this Bill,
serve a purpose to which no exception in principle can cogently be taken.
Furthermore, it is important to know that the Bill empowers the court, upon
application by a creditor, and if certain requirements are met, to condone
such creditor's failure to comply with the notice requirements provided for
in the Bill.

I would like to make use of this opportunity to thank the chairperson of
the portfolio committee, Adv Johnny de Lange, and members of that committee
for the hard work they have put into the consideration and improvement of
this Bill. I am of the opinion that the high standard which this committee
has set for itself in its approach to and processing of legislation in
general is, once again, reflected in the manner in which the committee
dealt with this Bill.

I have noted the contents of the portfolio committee's report on the Bill,
and I would like to give the committee the assurance that I will see to it
that my department attends, as a matter of urgency, to the issues which
fall within our line function. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson, ladies and gentlemen, hon members, I rise in
unconditional support of this Bill on behalf of the ANC, and also to thank
all the parties that were involved with the drafting of this Bill. It has
been passed without any opposition, but more importantly, it is an
incredibly technical and difficult Bill. We had to sit long hours and spend
much time in trying to really sort out what the law is in this regard. I
really want to thank everyone for the role they have played in this regard.
Of course, that includes the officials from the department and the SA Law
Commission who have assisted. They really have had to keep their wits about
them.

Before I say a few words on the Bill, I just want to raise one issue to
which the Minister alluded towards the end of his input. It is the fact
that, once again, we had to amend parts of the Black Administration Act.
All the parties have found it quite extraordinary that the Black
Administration Act has not as yet been reviewed. As members know, the Black
Administration Act, which was passed in 1927, was the cornerstone for the
manner in which Africans were treated in this country under the apartheid
government. Our government committee is making, I think, the third
amendment to this Act. Furthermore, about a week ago the High Court found
that certain provisions in the regulations that deal with intestate black
estates are unconstitutional. It is very clear that this Bill is
iniquitous. It was one of the cornerstones of apartheid.

As far as our department is concerned, we have dealt with those parts that
we administer. But the problem is that most of the Bill falls under other
departments. Therefore, we really are urging Government to try to get the
departments together in order, once and for all, to review this legislation
and get rid of those parts that we particularly do not need anymore, which
I think will probably be the whole Bill. I cannot imagine that even one
word of it should stay on the Statute Book. I raise this on behalf of the
whole committee, because I think this is really important. As I have said,
most of the aspects have already been amended by our department, but the
problem is to get the other departments to review the other aspects.

As has already been mentioned, this Bill really deals with a difficult part
of our law, which is the question of what restrictions we place on
litigants who want to bring cases against the state. For example, what time
limits do we set and what procedural steps do we take to create limitations
for a person litigating against the state?

As members know, the cornerstone of dealing with prescription in this
country is the Prescription Act of 1969. This is an old and archaic Act. We
have made reference to this in our resolution. It seems to us that the
whole area of prescription needs to be reviewed. We cannot rely on this
1969 Act, particularly because we have found in our law that there are more
exceptions to the rule than otherwise. There are more pieces of legislation
that deviate from the Prescription Act than comply with it.

This was brought about during the apartheid era. On the one hand periods of
prescription were provided for in the Prescription Act, of which there were
many - the most important one being a three-year prescription period,
except when one of many disabilities applied, such as in the case of
minors. On the other hand, a lot of other laws, for example in terms of the
police, defence, correctional services, intelligence, the Public Service,
and provincial and local government, were passed,  creating further
restrictions, not only on the time in which one could bring a case, but
also in terms of other procedural restrictions. For example, in most of
these cases one had to bring a notice within one month or six months from
the date the action arose. If one did not meet those requirements, then
one's case simply prescribed and one could not bring a case anymore.

Therefore, if one studies this Bill one realises the fact that what it does
- and it is sad that its name originally referred to limitation of legal
proceedings - is that it extends the rights of people. Firstly, what we
have done is to harmonise or create uniformity of all those laws that we
deal with in the Bill in terms of prescription. We have repealed all those
Acts that limit the period to lower than three years, and have made the
Prescription Act now apply to all those laws. This will mean, at the very
least, that one will always have a prescription period of three years. To
use an example, the South African Police Service Act at present provides
for a prescription period of one year, but once we have passed this
legislation the prescription period will move up to three years in cases
against the police.

Therefore, when it comes to state institutions or what we have defined as
organs of state - which we have defined more narrowly in this legislation
than in the Constitution, but still very broadly - being sued, both
contractually and delictually, we have now changed the prescription period
to a more balanced period of at least three years.

Let me say this before I get to the second point. On that first point of
prescription, I must mention that we have not included a review of all
legislation dealing with prescription. For example, the Motor Vehicle
Accidents Act is not included in this legislation. This Act has its own
rules pertaining to prescription. The President has established a
commission to review all aspects of the Motor Vehicle Accidents Act and we
felt that that commission should also look at the area of prescription.
 
The same goes for the Workmen's Compensation Act. We have not included it
in this Bill because we felt it needed to be addressed separately. On the
whole, other than these, most other pieces of legislation dealing with
prescription are contained in this Bill.

Secondly, this Bill also provides that in all these cases a notice must be
provided to the organ of state against which one litigates. Such a notice
must be lodged within six months after the debt becomes due. In the case of
a delict, the debt, for example, becomes due on the day of a car accident.
Within six months of that happening, one has to let the organ of state
know, by notice, that one is going to proceed against it.

However, we included a further innovation which did not exist previously.
That is that if one does not give one's notice within the six-month period,
we allow such a person to approach the court, and if he or she can give
sufficient reasons why he or she did not give notice in time, the court can
condone the fact that a notice was not given. Therefore, in theory, until
one's prescription period has passed, which will usually be three years,
one would still be able to apply for condonation if one did not give notice
in time.

Hon members can therefore see that we have, on the one hand, extended
people's rights by extending the period within which people can litigate.
On the other hand, we have tried to retain some certainty for the organs of
state. We have tried to create a balance. Thus, even in cases where people
did not strictly stay within the parameters of the law, courts can decide
if they have a good enough reason not to have given notice. And if they
have a good enough reason, then, of course, it can be condoned.

I therefore feel that, on the whole, we now have a very balanced piece of
legislation regulating when one wants to sue or litigate against organs of
state. Firstly, we have extended the rights of our people by extending the
period of prescription. This is essential, especially in the rural areas
where people are more illiterate, and it could take some time before they
reach a lawyer or can actually make their case known. It will give them
more leeway and enable them to litigate at a later stage.

Secondly, of course, we have also created some certainty for Government in
the sense that there has to be a notice period. Yet, we have not made it
inflexible, because the court can still condone it.

A lot of what we have done has flowed from our new Constitution, which
stipulates that every person has the right to a court hearing of any
dispute he or she would want to place before the court. On the basis of the
interpretation of that right the Constitutional Court has, in the Mohlomi
case, decided that the notices required by the Defence Act were
unconstitutional.

In my opinion we have gone even further than the Mohlomi case, and I have
no doubt that we have complied with both our Constitution and the ruling in
the Mohlomi case, and that we have brought everything in line with the
Constitution. In my view we have, in this regard, created a much better and
more humane regime around prescription periods.

As I have said, we also passed a resolution which deals extensively with
issues which we could not include in this legislation. The most important
of these is the Black Administration Act. We think the whole Prescription
Act should also be reviewed, as well as a few other issues. I suggest that
everyone should read about these in the resolution. [Applause.]

Mr M A MZIZI: Chairperson, Minister and other Ministers, I rise on behalf
of the IFP to support the Bill. We support this Bill, not only because it
is a good piece of legislation, but because the Bill has actually come a
long way since the dark days when these Bills were prescriptive. The Bill
does, indeed, cover many areas. In the past, the miners could not bring a
lawsuit against Government institutions but, from now on, they may do so.
One other thing that I want to address is an issue raised by my colleague
in the FF ...

... die agb Corné Mulder. Hy het nou die dag bekommerd geraak oor my
toespraak tydens die debat oor Zimbabwe en wel omdat ek in isiZulu gepraat
het. Miskien was sy besorgdheid geregverdig. Die probleem is dat daar
miskien nie 'n tolk was nie. Ek wil hom verseker dat as ons in ons eie taal
praat, dit nie is omdat ons probeer om iets weg te steek nie. Daar is baie
ongeletterde swartes daarbuite wat nie kan verstaan as ons Afrikaans praat
nie. Hulle mag dink ons praat miskien in 'n hoogdrawende taal wat hulle nie
kan verstaan nie. Ek wil die agb Mulder ook verseker dit is nie soos
daardie toespraak van my oupa Dingaan kort voor die Slag van Bloedrivier
nie. Hy moet net nie bekommerd raak nie. Hy moet rustig bly. Ons kan nie
weer vir hom sê wat in daardie toespraak gesê is nie. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... the hon Corné Mulder. He became concerned about my speech during the
debate on Zimbabwe the other day, because I spoke in isiZulu. Perhaps his
concern was justified. The problem is that there may not have been an
interpreter. I want to assure him that when we speak in our own language,
it is not because we are attempting to hide anything. There are many
illiterate blacks out there who cannot understand what we are saying when
we speak Afrikaans. They may think that we are speaking in a grandiloquent
language which they cannot understand. I also want to assure the hon Mulder
that it is not like that speech of my grandfather Dingaan shortly before
the Battle of Blood River. He should not become worried. He must remain
calm. We cannot repeat to him what was said in that speech.]

Mangisho-ke lapha ukuthi lo mthetho ufike ngesikhathi esiwulungele kube

paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to mention that this Bill comes at the right time, actually
it is a long awaited Bill. When one looks at it, it says that even a child
can be represented. If one wants to institute an overdue application, one
has the right to make that application in court so that the court will
assist one in continuing one's case.

What I want to say to the hon the Minister is that we have not discussed
the Motor Vehicle Accidents Act, legislation on road incidents. There are
clauses which I think will have to be amended. For instance, if a person
loses a child in a road incident, when that person goes to court for
compensation, he is told that he has not lost anything, because that child
did not bring any money home. If a man who has lost his wife goes to court
for compensation, he is told that he will not be compensated because his
deceased wife did not bring any money home. But be that as it may, the
person has lost something precious to him.]

(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[One can understand how it must feel to be told, after losing one's
beautiful wife, that one should not worry because she was not the
breadwinner. The fact is that one has lost a loved one.  When the Bill is
being considered, what must be looked into is the issue of compensation for
the loss of a loved one rather than the question of whether or not that
person supported the families financially.]

Siyakubonga lokhu ngokuthi kufike ngesikhathi esikahle ngoba phela uma

[We appreciate this Bill since it has come at the right time. If a person
cannot make an overdue application, many of us will lose many things, as
happened in the past. It is good now that the present Government is
treating us with more consideration. [Applause.]]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, the New NP supports this Bill. As acting
spokesperson on Justice for the DA, it is a pleasure for me to say, for the
first time that I have occasion in this House, that the DA supports the
Bill. My colleague, Hendrik Schmidt of the DP will also confirm this later
on in the debate.

The pleasure also derives from being able to speak on behalf of a much
larger group of democratically elected representatives of the people - up
from 28 to 68 members - which also includes the FA. On behalf of the DA, I
also support the remarks of the chairperson, the hon Johnny de Lange, on
the Black Administration Act.

This Bill is not controversial as far as it goes. It is supported by all
the parties in the House, as far as I am aware. Since this Bill was
originally introduced to Parliament by the Minister of Justice, it has not
only changed its name but also, to an extent, its nature, but its purpose
remains the same as originally intended by the SA Law Commission, namely,
to place limits on legal proceedings against Government institutions. It is
interesting to note the resolute manner in which the present governing
party appears to have adopted the penchant for euphemisms and euphemistic
titles of the previous government.

The Limitation of Legal Proceedings against Government Institutions Bill
has now become the Institution of Legal Proceedings against Organs of State
Bill. But the limitations, indeed, remain. That having been said, I do not
disagree with the chairperson, the hon De Lange, that in some cases, the
prescription periods have been extended and the parameters and structure
for the limitations have indeed been greatly improved by this offering of
the Portfolio Committee on Justice.

As often happens, the original Bill has been almost entirely redrafted in
the committee - as the chairperson indicated - with the very able
assistance of, as usual, Messrs Labuschagne and De Lange of the Department
of Justice. Significant improvements to the Bill include the tightening of
definitions and extension of the application of the definition of organs of
state and, thereby, the Bill and more detailed, rational provisions
relating to giving of notices and service and process.

The main thrust of the Bill, as has been indicated, is to create as much
uniformity as possible in the provisions relating to the institution of
legal proceedings against Government bodies or organs of state as they are
defined in the Bill, for the recovery of debt and to further regulate the
periods of prescription which apply to the debts of Government. While the
Bill is highly technical and creates greater uniformity and certainty in
relation to legal cases instituted against the state, this is to be
welcomed, which is the main reason why we in the New NP and the Democratic
Alliance support the legislation.
The question of whether such limitations fall foul of the Constitution
remains to be resolved, as has been indicated in the resolution of the
committee. In fact, the extent to which different periods of notice of
proceedings and differing prescription periods applied to various areas of
government was quite a revelation and certainly did not favour, in the
past, the man or woman in the street seeking justice against a Government
body. This has, hopefully, been remedied to some extent.

Both ``organ of state'' and ``debtor'' are widely defined in the Bill.
``Organ of state'' includes all national and provincial government
departments, municipalities and officials or institutions exercising powers
and functions in terms of the Constitution or provincial constitutions.
``Debt'' includes debts arising from unlawful acts and omissions for which
the organs of state may be liable to pay damages, based either on delictual
or wrongful action on the part of the institution, and official or
statutory liability. However, the Bill will not apply to any debt arising
from contractual liability.

The Bill imposes a duty on any creditor to give the organ of state written
notice of the intention to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of
the debt which must be served on the Government body within six months of
the debt becoming due. Full particulars of the debt must be given in the
notice. But, recognition that we are in the information technology age has
been incorporated into the Bill, for the first time in legislation before
this House, by providing that the notice may indeed be sent by e-mail or
fax. However, the Bill also implies that such a drastic step would only be
resorted to in order to beat a deadline as a hard copy of the notice must
be delivered within a week of the e-mail being sent. Nevertheless, this
provision, in an otherwise legalistic and technical Bill, has created new
millennium history and presumably, the precedent thus created will be
followed in future in legislation dealing with the provision of notice.

The matter of the six-month notice period is not unproblematic in the sense
that it reduces a 12-month notice period applicable in certain provisions
being repealed by the Bill. However, a creditor may apply to court for
condonation of failure to give notice within the six-month period which the
court may grant on good cause shown, and provided that the organ of state
is not unreasonably prejudiced. The Bill also deals with prescription of
these debts.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking time
has expired.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, my colleague will deal with the other aspects
of the Bill.

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, this Bill is of a highly technical and legal
nature. The question which needs to be answered is whether the Bill, in
regulating the institution of legal proceedings against organs of state,
constitutes a threat to the rights of citizens.

More in particular, we should ask whether the Bill also grants protection
to impoverished people whose rights have been grossly infringed and who,
firstly, may be unable to meet the necessary deadline of giving notice
within six months after the debt has become due, or, secondly, may only
become aware of their rights to compensation long after the event.

The answer to this question, in our view, should be an affirmative one, in
that the limitation of six months for the giving of notice of intended
legal proceedings against organs of state, as defined in the Bill, is
reasonable and justifiable in terms of the Constitution. The provision for
a court to condone a creditor's failure to give timeous notice within six
months after a debt has arisen is entirely consistent with the common law
concerning the entitlement to apply for condonation of the late
notification of the institution of such legal proceedings.

The mere fact that a specified period is mentioned in the Bill does not
exclude any affected person from bringing such an application against an
organ of state after the six months has expired. The circumstances of each
and every individual case will have to be considered and weighed against
the requirements, set out in the Bill, being that the debt has not been
extinguished by prescription, that good cause exists for the failure by the
applicant and that the organ of state was not unreasonably prejudiced by
the failure of the creditor to notify the organ of state timeously. The
decision, therefore, lies squarely within the discretion of the court.

It is to be noted that not all civil claims are dealt with by this Bill.
Two important exceptions should be mentioned. The first is the exclusion of
all contractual matters when the organ of state as a contracting party is
affected. This is so because the reason for the granting of a six months'
notice period to organs of state is based on the practical requirement
that, due to their size and the number of issues being dealt with
simultaneously, including the institution of various legal actions, an
organ of state needs to know which actions are contemplated to be
instituted against it, in order to preserve the necessary records and/or
obtain evidence pertaining to the events relied upon by the other party in
suing it. Secondly, a party suing another person, be it a natural or a
juristic  person, is only bound, in terms of this Bill, to give
notification to an organ of state as defined in the Bill.

A further important aspect of this Bill relates to the intention to provide
uniformity for the extinction of debts by prescription. This, in short,
means that excluding a small number of existing Acts, the normal period of
three years has to lapse since the debt arose before it can be stated that
a debt has, in fact, prescribed. This is in favour of those persons and/or
institutions who intend to sue organs of state for debt arising due to any
unlawful act or commission for which an organ of state is liable for the
payment of damages. In this respect, the Bill does away with certain more
limited time periods of, inter alia, 12 months for the prescription of
certain debts, by means of a schedule repealing sections of, inter alia,
the Black Administration Act of 1927, the Merchant Shipping Act and various
other legal aspects.

It is, however, unfortunate and surprising to find that the Black
Administration Act of 1927, or at least certain sections thereof, is still
operational. It is our view as the DP that the simplification and
uniformity of a notification period, an extinctive prescription period of
three years, is desirable to ensure that little is left to chance and the
ignorance of people who intend to sue other organs of state not defined in
this Bill, and who do not do so due to a lack of knowledge of the
particular provisions prescribed, within the particular Act applicable to
the civil action. We therefore support the request by the portfolio
committee that certain sections of a number of Acts listed in the reports
of the portfolio committee, inter alia the Compensation for Occupational
Injuries and Diseases Act, the Road Accident Fund Act and the Legal
Succession to the South African Transport Services Act, be reviewed.
The DP therefore supports the Bill as it provides, inter alia, for well-
defined periods relating to a notification period of six months as well as
the reinstatement of the period of three years pertaining to the
prescription of debt by extinction.

Mr M E MABETA: Chairperson, the UDM fully supports this Bill. We also agree
with the resolutions taken by the committee that the provisions have to be
revisited in order to arrive at a more uniform notice period in notices and
prescriptions, even though this means that certain Acts, such as the Black
Administration Act, have to be visited in a piecemeal approach.

However, the end result will be a more harmonious, uniform and sustainable
system which accommodates differences, where appropriate, in a manner that
does not lead to negative consequences such as litigation, uncertainty and
injustice. They are unnecessary and come at a great cost to the public.

We fully support the Bill.

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, hon Minister, it is undeniable that the various
statutory provisions that limited the right of a person to institute
proceedings against organs of state resulted in much injustice over the
years.

When one, furthermore, considers the multiplicity of provisions regulating
notice and prescription periods, it is apparent that these provisions
created a legal minefield for lawyers attempting to assist clients in
instituting actions against organs of state. Thus, in order to create
uniformity, existing provisions, with certain exceptions, are repealed by
this Bill, and substituted with uniform notice and prescription periods
which will apply in respect of all proceedings against organs of state, as
defined, arising out of a debt.

The question arose during the committee's deliberations on the desirability
of organs of state receiving prior notice of such proceedings at all. The
rationale for the notice requirement is that Government institutions should
be notified of intended litigation to enable them to investigate an
incident properly, and if necessary, arrange to settle the matter.

This requirement was confirmed by the Constitutional Court in the Mohlomi
decision, referred to by the hon the Minister and Adv De Lange. One should
further bear in mind that condonation can be obtained where notice is not
timeously given, and that such condonation will be granted where the action
has not prescribed, where good cause is shown and where there is no
unreasonable prejudice to the state.

The ACDP supports this legislation as it creates uniformity, subject to
certain exceptions, regarding both notice and prescription periods
applicable when one wishes to recover damages from an organ of state. It
furthermore addresses the manifest inequality which existed between persons
who wished to claim against organs of state, as opposed to claiming against
some other defendant.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, hon Minister, the introduction of this
Bill is the culmination of a recommendation made in 1985 regarding time
limits for the institution of actions against the state.

This Bill, is an adaptation of the draft legislation which encompassed the
recommendations contained in the report of the SA Law Commission and has
taken into account changes in legislation since that report was published
and the reasoning of the Constitutional Court regarding the
constitutionality of a provision in the Defence Act, which resulted in the
SA Law Commission submitting a supplementary report.

Clause 2 of this Bill clearly lists circumstances in which the provisions
will not apply to debts, eg where the debt has been extinguished by
prescription before the Bill comes into operation, where legal proceedings
have been instituted in respect of a debt before the Bill comes into
operation, in which case the proceedings must be continued and concluded as
if the Bill had not been passed. These repeals and amendments will
facilitate and expedite the proceedings.

Clause 3 contains the main thrust of the Bill, namely that no creditor may
institute legal proceedings for the recovery of a debt against an organ of
state, unless such creditor has given the organ of state written notice of
his or her intention to do so or the organ of state has given written
consent for the institution of legal proceedings without such notice.

Clause 4 sets out different ways in which a notice of intention to
institute legal proceedings may be served on an organ of state. It goes on
to explain clearly where a notice has been sent ... [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, in a democratic country the people, through
political parties, decide how the various organs of state should function
at the economic, social and political levels. The state has a duty to
govern social order and implement legitimate action against any citizen who
violates the laws and administration of the country. Likewise, the state
has to lead by example, and must be accountable to any citizen if a
particular contract of performance has been breached. Therefore, the
Institution of Legal Proceedings against Organs of State Bill empowers
creditors to institute legal action, subject to fair criteria and within a
reasonable period of six months, against the state to recover damages or
debt.

The Bill facilitates the course of the administration of justice without
prejudicing creditor or debtor. The MF supports the Institution of Legal
Proceedings against Organs of State Bill.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KOTA: Chairperson, hon members, in this debate one has often
heard people say how technical this Bill is. In fact, this is a trick of
the trade. Lawyers often say that things are very technical so that they do
not have to explain the practical import of what they are saying.

This Bill, as it happens, is of enormous practical import. As any
practising attorney will tell you, the time periods and the prescription
periods that applied previously posed an enormous challenge and often led
to many injustices. In some instances a person who had suffered damages at
the hands of the state would have as little as a month to institute action
or lose forever the right to claim.

One could legitimately ask: Why should the state be treated differently
from other litigants? The argument goes that the state needs to be treated
differently when sued so that its complex bureaucracies can regulate their
affairs. However, the organisational and functional needs of the state have
to be balanced with the rights of the individual, particularly in our
constitutional dispensation, and so the Act provides for the following
innovations. A six-month period now applies for notices to be served on the
state. Servicing of these notices can now be made in the form of fax or e-
mail. If the notice period, for some good reason, is not able to be
complied with by the litigant, then the court is able to condone this
shortcoming. Furthermore, a three-year period is allowed for the issue of
summons, as opposed to the 12-month period that would generally apply.

In short, this Bill strikes a good balance between the rights of the
individual and the peculiar needs of the state. It simplifies the area of
prescription and notice periods when the state is sued, and I am sure that
everybody will welcome this new Act. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I notice that the hon Mr Salie
Manie's vacuum cleaner has not done an efficient job of clearing this House
entirely of its members. Hon members, that concludes ... Oh, we still have
to hear from the Minister. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, I do
not think I should say anything, save to thank all the hon members and the
parties they represented here for supporting this Bill, and also to say
that I have given an undertaking to the chairperson of the portfolio
committee that within the next six months we will be able to respond as a
department to all the issues raised in the memorandum that the portfolio
committee has kindly given us on this Bill - as government, rather than as
the department. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 17:15.

         with amendments [B 55A - 2000].

3.    Eighth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 6
     September 2000:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered and
     examined the Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements
     of Vote 9: Constitutional Development for the year ended 31 March 1999
     [RP 132-99], as well as certain papers referred to it, and having heard
     evidence, reports as follows:


     1.     Financial management and internal audit
         (Par 3.4, page 5)

         The Committee commends the Accounting officer on the solid
         foundation that has been laid on which the Department can build
         its financial management capacity. In particular, the dedicated
         focus on financial management as an essential part of general
         management is commendable, and the Committee is also keen to see
         the results of the value-for-money tests in relation to work done
         on behalf of the Department by contractors outside the public
         sector. Most importantly, the Committee commends the Department on
         the steps taken to ensure appropriate control over the extensive
         transfer payments made by it.

         The Committee also took note of the Director-General's concern
         about the limited financial management expertise available in the
         public sector. Given the imminent implementation of the Public
         Finance Management Act, this expertise was becoming available only
         at a premium that may not be affordable in terms of the public
         sector pay scales.

         The Committee recommends that the Director-General persevere with
         the actions aimed at improved financial management, specifically
         with regard to the following aspects:


         (1)     To ensure that the Audit Committee fully complies with the
              requirements of section 77 of the Public Finance Management
              Act, which could entail the application of section 77(c).

         (2)     To bring the Internal Audit Component up to full strength,
              especially with regard to the head of the unit, and ensure
              continuing professional training for the staff in question.
              The Monitoring Unit: Internal Audit and Audit Committees
              established within the Office of the Accountant-General should
              advise the Accounting Officer and the Audit Committee on the
              adequacy of the staffing of the Department's Internal Audit
              Unit in terms of generally accepted benchmarks, and report to
              the Committee in this regard.

         (3)     To tighten up the relevant control measures to prevent any
              irregularities regarding cheques.


         With regard to other aspects relating to the implementation of the
         Public Finance Management Act, the Committee noted a number of
         commendable initiatives that the Accounting Officer had initiated,
         such as the recent review of the Department's approval of
         delegations as the first major step towards implementation of the
         Act. The Committee also noted the interaction with the National
         Treasury with regard to the management information systems
         currently available to public sector management that will have to
         support the various reporting requirements of the Public Finance
         Management Act.

         The Committee therefore further recommends that -


         (a)     the Accounting Officer report to the Committee regarding
              the manner in which the results of improved delegations will
              be measured, and whether any improvement has indeed been
              registered as a result;

         (b)     the Accounting Officer report on the extent of the success
              of aligning the Department's business plan with the
              performance agreements of its senior managers;

         (c)     the National Treasury provide the Committee with a brief
              report on the progress made with further improvements to the
              information systems required by Accounting Officers in order
              to comply with their reporting responsibilities in terms of
              the Public Finance Management Act.


     2.     Multiparty negotiation process: Conference facilities at World
         Trade Centre
         (Par 3.1, page 2)

         The Committee heard evidence from the Special Investigating Unit
         on its investigation into possible irregularities in expenditure
         relating to the leasing of conference facilities at the World
         Trade Centre, reported on in the Auditor-General's Reports on the
         1992-93 to 1997-98 financial years.

         Having referred the report of the Special Investigating Unit to
         the Auditor-General for comment, and having taken note of his
         comments, the Committee recommends that -


         (1)     the Accounting Officer fully investigate the possibility
              that a double payment might have been made by the Department
              with regard to certain assets which were invoiced directly to
              the Department but for which rental was also charged;

         (2)     the Parliamentary Law Advisers be requested to comment on
              the Special Investigating Unit's opinion that any claim by the
              Department against the WTC cannot be recovered, owing to the
              Prescription Act; and

         (3)     the Department of Public Service and Administration, in
              consultation with the National Treasury, report to the
              Committee whether appropriate disciplinary or other
              regulations exist that would enable action to be taken against
              Accounting Officers who allow prescription to take place,
              thereby resulting in a loss to the State.


     3.     Unauthorised expenditure, R217 215,05
         (Par 3.1.2(c), page 4)

         The Committee took note of the finding of an independent
         consultant, appointed by the Director-General, that no official
         could be held responsible for the unauthorised expenditure. The
         Committee also took note that the Auditor-General concurred with
         the report of the consultant.

         The Committee therefore recommends that the unauthorised
         expenditure of R217 215,05 be approved by Parliament.


     Report to be considered.

4.    Ninth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated 6
     September 2000:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered and
     examined the Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements
     of Vote 8: Communications for the year ended 31 March 1999 [RP 131-99],
     as well as certain papers referred to it, and having heard evidence,
     reports as follows:

     The Committee commends the Department on its successful transition from
     a statutory body to a national Department of State and in particular on
     the efficient and professional manner in which the accounting systems
     were transformed. However, the Committee wishes to note that although
     the issues reported in the Auditor-General's Report appear to be of
     lesser materiality, issues of non-compliance and weak internal controls
     often lead to irregularities.


     1.     Management and internal control (Par 2.2.4, page 2)

         The Committee noted the evidence of the Director-General on the
         action taken against an official who by his actions had
         disregarded the requirements of the financial regulations,
         Treasury Instructions and departmental rules.

         The Committee therefore recommends that the Director-General -


         (1)     indicate to it how the success of the corrective measures
              already taken will prevent the repetition of similar
              transgressions; and

         (2)     ensure that staff members are fully conversant with the
              measures to be implemented as well as with the applicable
              rules and regulations.


     2.     Personnel expenditure (Par 2.2.6, page 6)

         The Committee has noted the evidence of the Director-General on
         the promotion and appointment of certain personnel, and the fact
         that these matters have not been finalised between the Department
         and the Office of the Auditor-General. The Committee has also
         noted that the Director-General is to seek legal opinion in this
         regard. The Committee therefore requests that he report back to
         the Committee on progress made.


     3.     Internal audit (Par 3.2.1, page 4)

         The Committee has taken cognisance of the processes in place to
         address deficiencies in the internal audit function, as well as
         those of getting internal control up to the required standard. A
         fully operational internal audit function is indispensable for the
         proper management of finance.

         The Committee welcomes the training workshops for personnel of the
         Department on the subject of internal control. The Committee
         requests the Director-General to submit to it the following within
         two weeks of the tabling of this Report in the National Assembly:


         (1)     A report on the abovementioned workshop.

         (2)     A copy of the Audit Committee Charter.

         (3)     A copy of the Internal Audit Charter.

         (4)     The latest audit programme, approved by the Audit
              Committee.


     4.     Student loans (Par 3.3.1, page 5)

         The issue of student loans has not been resolved between the
         Auditor-General's Office and the Department. The Committee
         recommends that this issue be resolved and that the Department as
         well as the Auditor-General report back to the Committee as a
         matter of urgency.


     5.     Fruitless expenditure: Interest on credit card accounts (Par
         3.4.1, page 6)

         The Committee expresses its concern that the late settlements of
         accounts resulted in interest payments amounting to R47 270.

         The Committee views such fruitless expenditure in a very serious
         light, more so because it is a waste of tax- payers' money. It is
         encouraging to note that the Director-General has initiated steps
         to ensure that such a situation does not recur in future.

         The Committee urges the Department to ensure that the
         implementation of the corrective measures is maintained on an
         ongoing basis.

         The effectiveness of these measures will be closely monitored by
         the Committee, in conjunction with the Office of the Auditor-
         General.


     6.     Other debtors (Par 3.6, page 7)

         Regarding the sale of the former Capital Radio, it is noted that
         this matter is before the courts and is therefore sub judice. The
         Committee also noted that the Director-General was confident that
         a future proposal will realise R10 million.

         The Committee therefore requests that the Department report the
         outcome of the court case to it, as well as the details of any
         future sale proposal.


     7.     General


         (1)     Late submission of financial statements


              The Director-General assured the Committee that, in respect of
              the 1999-2000 financial year, the Department's financial
              statements would be submitted to the Auditor-General's Office
              before the required time. The Committee welcomed this
              assurance, especially in view of the requirements and
              provisions of the Public Finance Management Act.


         (2)     Procurement process
              Regarding the procurement process, the Committee recommends
              that the Director-General -


              (a) take appropriate steps to ensure adherence to all tender
                  procedures; and

              (b) respond in writing regarding the contract for the sale of
                  non-ferrous scrap metal of Telkom and the Post Office.


     Report to be considered.
