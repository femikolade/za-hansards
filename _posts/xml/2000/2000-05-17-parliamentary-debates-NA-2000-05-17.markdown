                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr S P MAKWETLA: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the meteoric rise of HIV infections in our country;

  (2) believes that all South Africans are genuinely concerned about this
       killer disease;

  (3) submits that HIV/Aids awareness will not be promoted by intimidating
       public representatives and office bearers to undergo public tests,
       but by destigmatising HIV/Aids and creating an atmosphere which is
       friendly and compassionate in respect of people living with HIV/Aids;

  (4) recognises that such conditions will encourage people to undergo
       voluntary tests;

  (5) recognises that undergoing an HIV/Aids test is a sensitive and
       personal decision which should be treated with confidentiality;

  (6) expresses concern about the proliferation of public gimmicks which
       may not meaningfully advance the campaign against Aids; and

  (7) calls on political parties to be seized with carefully thought out
       interventions which can make a difference.

[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of the
House I will move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  today is World Telecommunications Day;

       (b)  the information and telecommunications revolution in our day is
           the economic equivalent of the Industrial Revolution of old; and

       (c)  South Africa is well placed to establish itself on the right
           side of the digital divide;


  (2) expresses its concern at the fact that Government is not using such
       avenues as are available to it to liberalise the value-added network
       services field; and

  (3) urges the Minister, under section 40 of the Telecommunications Act,
       to fix dates upon which Telkom's monopoly will end on -


       (a)  facility provision;

       (b)  voice services; and

       (c)  the cession or subletting of facilities, in respect of value-
           added network services.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:

       another;

  (2) expresses its grief at this loss and commiserates with the families
       who have sustained this loss;

  (3) denounces violent protest in a country in which democracy prevails
       and negotiation has become a world-recognised trademark of our
       people;

  (4) calls on all parties to return to active negotiation; and

  (5) urges all students to recognise that no university can become a
       centre of excellence if it is continually constrained by financial
       considerations and if mid-term disturbances lead to disruption of the
       academic calendar and the closure of the university in order to
       protect life and property.

Mr M M Z DYANI: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Minister of Labour, Membathisi Mdladlana, yesterday launched
           a draft code to ensure that workers with HIV are not
           discriminated against in the workplace; and

       (b)  a joint committee of the National Employment, Development and
           Labour Council's labour market chamber and the Commission for
           Employment Equity will consider public comments and advise the
           Minister on the final contents of the code; and


  (2) calls on the department to proceed with its plans to create a
       nondiscriminatory environment for people living with HIV in the

[Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I will move:

Mr M N RAMODIKE: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I will move on behalf of the UDM:


  That the House -


  (1) extends sincere condolences to the families and friends of the miners
       who died in the tragic Beatrix mining accident;

  (2) expresses concern regarding mine safety, acknowledging that, in spite
       of the successes achieved in the past few years, recent events
       indicate that mining accidents are on the increase again;

  (3) calls on the Government to reconsider the legislation governing mine
       safety, since the myriad of safety regulations and penalties are not
       enough of a deterrent and enforcement is lacking;

  (4) allows the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy an opportunity
       to give serious attention to this matter; and

  (5) calls on the Minister of Minerals and Energy to set aside a greater
       portion of her budget for mine safety inspections.

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day
of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:

  (1) notes that SA Airways has agreed to an out-of-court settlement in
       which it will pay R100 000 to a job applicant who was refused
       employment because he tested HIV-positive during pre-employment
       testing;

  (2) welcomes the statement by SAA's lawyers that the settlement was an
       implicit admission that the exclusion of the man on the grounds of
       his HIV status was unjustified; and

  (3) calls on prospective employers to obey the letter and spirit of the
       Employment Equity Act, and not to attempt to use HIV status as a
       reason for exclusion from employment, but rather to monitor and
       support those employees who have been diagnosed with the disease, as
       long as they are able to execute their duties.

[Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, I give notice that on the next sitting day of
the House I shall move on behalf of the UCDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with shock how some heavyweights of the ANC in the North West
       province are pillaging the provincial coffers by engaging in stark
       nepotism, evasion of tax payment and self-enrichment at the expense
       of the public;

  (2) challenges Premier Popo Molefe to rise to the occasion and show
       resolve by releasing the long-awaited results of the Moseneke and
       Gobodo commissions of inquiry;

  (3) requests the premier to remind his constituency that this country
       operates on the Batho Pele premise and not on ``rona fela'' or
       ``ourselves only''; and

       alleged corruption throughout the province and in the provincial
       Department of Local Government, Planning and Housing in particular.

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the recent passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act in
       the United States which will form an important plank in the US's
       policy on Africa;

  (2) further notes that this legislation poses both opportunities and
       challenges, and that it contains specific provisions dealing with
       democracy and good governance which the international investor
       community considers a prerequisite for continued foreign direct
       investment flows and stable trade relations;

  (3) further notes that President Mbeki will be addressing a joint sitting
       of the US Senate and Congress during his upcoming state visit to the
       United States; and
  (4) calls on -


       (a)  the President to state South Africa's support for the African
           Growth and Opportunity Act and to reassure our trading partners
           of a stable outlook for the SADC region; and

       (b)  the Departments of Trade and Industry and of Foreign Affairs to
           forge a dynamic partnership to ensure that South Africa
           maximises the opportunities flowing from the African Growth and
           Opportunity Act by linking South African exporters to targeted
           markets and business opportunities in the US.

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the IFP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  South Africa has on its Statute Book some of the most impressive
           and progressive legislation, built up in a short period of six
           years; and

       (b)  constitutionality has become the centre point for the operation,
           growth and development of our society;


  (2) regards it as totally unconscionable for court officials to undermine
       this great achievement by limiting the sittings of our courts to an
       average of three and a half hours per day, leading to enormous
       bottlenecks, delays and even a miscarriage of justice; and

  (3) calls upon the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development
       and supports him to ensure that the anomalous situation obtaining in
       our courts is monitored on a day-by-day basis with a view to dealing
       with indiscipline and all of the other facts which impede the
       judiciary ...

[Time expired.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on the next sitting
day of the House I shall move on behalf of the ANC:


  That the House -

       (a)  today, 17 May, is World Telecommunications Day;

       (b)  the telecommunications sector is the fastest growing sector
           globally; and

       (c)  the South African telecommunications sector has undergone
           dramatic changes in the past five years and that Telkom is at
           the forefront of this revolution;


  (2) acknowledges that telecommunications is the indispensable back-bone
       of the reconstruction and development of our country;

  (3) recognises that new technologies have the potential to improve the
       quality of life of our people;

  (4) calls on national and international telecommunications bodies to
       continue to narrow the gap between technology-rich and technology-
       poor countries; and

  (5) urges Telkom to continue to improve the quality and level of service
       delivery, especially to previously disadvantaged communities.

[Applause.]

Adv A H GAUM: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek op die volgende
sittingsdag namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die dood van 'n student van die Universiteit van Durban-Westville
       betreur en versoek dat die ondersoek van die polisie en die
       Departement van Onderwys na die omstandighede van die student se dood
       so gou moontlik afgehandel word;

  (2) die studente veroordeel wat hulle die afgelope tyd gereeld tot geweld
       op kampusse gewend het en vir die chaos by sommige van ons
       universiteite verantwoordelik is;

  (3) van oordeel is dat hierdie chaos en voorvalle van geweld
       kontraproduktief is vir die skep van 'n onderrig- en leerkultuur by
       Suid-Afrikaanse universiteite; en


     4) Minister Kader Asmal versoek om dringend 'n taakspan aan te stel om
        die geweldskultuur by sekere kampusse te ondersoek en aanbevelings

       and requests that the investigation by the police and the Department
       of Education into the circumstances surrounding the student's death
       be finalised as soon as possible;
  (2) condemns the students who have in recent times regularly resorted to
       violence on campuses and are responsible for the chaos at some of our
       universities;

  (3) is of the opinion that such chaos and incidents of violence are
       counterproductive to the creation of a culture of teaching and
       learning at South African universities; and

       investigate the culture of violence on certain campuses and to make
       recommendations as regards the termination thereof.]

       whilst simultaneously succeeding in preserving thousands of jobs

       entities into viable businesses to the benefit of the parastatals,
       the economy and the workers.
