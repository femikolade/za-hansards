                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Madam Chair, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the lawless behaviour of the government of Zimbabwe,
       that is flagrantly flying in the face of its own High Court decisions
       on the unlawful land grab and occupation of farms belonging to
       Zimbabwean commercial farmers, by so-called war veterans;


  (2) notes that as a consequence it is inevitable that this rogue
       government, which is fast running out of resources to prop itself up
       as an organised state, is likely to collapse soon and become
       dysfunctional;


  (3) therefore calls upon the Government of South Africa publicly to put,
       as such, ``blue water'' between itself and the despotic behaviour of
       the failing government of President Robert Mugabe; and


  (4) further calls upon our Government to have urgent contingency plans in
       place to prevent contagion of instability in the region with the
       inevitable collapse of Zimbabwe, and to prepare plans for the urgent
       reconstruction by SADC and the world community of a free and
       democratic post-Mugabe Zimbabwe, in the interests of all in the
       region.

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende sitting van
die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy afkeur uitspreek van die rassistiese veldtog wat die ANC-leierskap
       in die Wes-Kaap voer;


  (2) kennis neem dat die rassistiese veldtog gevoer word na afloop van 'n
       resolusie teen rassisme wat verlede week in hierdie Raad geneem is;


  (3) verder kennis neem dat daar verwys word na die uitsprake van die
       leier in die Wes-Kaap, mnr Ebrahim Rasool, wat by 'n openbare
       vergadering openlik vir die gehoor aangepor het om vir die ANC-
       kandidaat te stem omdat sy regtig bruin is en haar nie bruin hoef
       voor te doen nie;


  (4) deur die DA versoek word om, in die lig daarvan dat uitsluitsel gegee
       word of die persoon wit genoeg is vir die wit kiesers en swart genoeg
       is vir die swart kiesers,  te beklemtoon hoe belaglik dit is; en


  (5) kennis neem daarvan dat die aanblaas van rassisme om stemme te werf
       gedoen word deur persone wat weier om te transformeer na die werklike
       Suid-Afrika.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting of the
House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) expresses its disapproval of the racist campaign being conducted by
       the ANC leadership in the Western Cape;


  (2) notes that this racist campaign is being conducted after a resolution
       against racism was taken in this Council last week;


  (3) furthermore notes that reference has been made to the remarks by the
       ANC leader in the Western Cape, Mr Ebrahim Rasool, who openly urged
       the audience at a public meeting to vote for the ANC candidate
       because she really was brown and did not have to pretend to be brown;


  (4) is requested by the DA, in view of the fact that a pronouncement has
       been made on whether a person is white enough for the white voters
       and black enough for the black voters, to stress how ridiculous this
       is; and


  (5) notes that the stirring up of racism in order to canvass votes is
       being done by persons who refuse to transform to the real South
       Africa.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat die Demokratiese
Alliansie by die volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad sy dank uitspreek dat -


  (1) daar nou 'n jaar na die eerste gerugte van onreëlmatigheid ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that the Democratic
Alliance will move at the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council expresses its thanks -


  (1) that a year after the first rumours of irregularity ...]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, we have at a previous sitting
of this Council objected to the use of the term ``Democratic Alliance'' to
refer to a political party. There is no such party as the Democratic
Alliance in this House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! No, there is no such party. I do not
know whether the member was saying that there is such a party. I thought he
was giving notice of a motion.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, he said that the Democratic
Alliance would move a motion at a next sitting. This is why I have
objected.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! There is not a party such as the
Democratic Alliance. Mrs Witbooi also made this reference.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I have to inform this House that there
definitely is a party called the Democratic Alliance ... [Interjections.]
... which is contesting the coming municipal elections.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Van Niekerk, in this House you
represent the New NP, and various other members represent the DP. As far as
I am aware, there has not been, in terms of the outcome of the election of
1999, a party called the Democratic Alliance represented in this House. I
do not recall that, but I may be mistaken. There may be such a party
represented in this House. It may have come into being in the House while I
was away at the Pan-African Parliament meeting, but I do not recall such a
representation. [Laughter.] Therefore, I think the member is right, unless
I am informed appropriately that the Democratic Alliance did in fact
participate in the 1999 election and there are members on a list of the
Democratic Alliance who are now in this House. Please assist me.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. I appreciate the
approach on this. The New NP ... [Laughter.] ... as part of the Democratic
Alliance in the municipal election, would like to give notice of a motion.

Ek sal by die volgende sitting van die Raad voorstel:
  Dat die Raad sy dank uitspreek dat -


  (1) daar nou 'n jaar na die eerste gerugte van onreëlmatigheid met die
       R43 biljoen se wapenkontrak 'n daadwerklike poging aangewend word om
       dit indringend te ondersoek;


  (2) die proses deeglik, maar spoedeisend afgehandel sal word sodat dit
       die skade wat aan Suid-Afrika se beeld berokken word, sal beperk; en


  (3) die persone wat deur die ondersoek geïdentifiseer word as nalatig te
       gewees het en/of deel van bedrog of enige ander misdryf te gewees het
       onmiddellik uit hulle poste ontslaan sal word en dat die reg sy loop
       sal neem om hulle te straf vir hulle dade en vir die skade wat elkeen
       in hierdie land raak.
(Translation of Afrikaans (draft resolution follows.)

[I shall move at the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council expresses its thanks that -


  (1) a year after the first rumours of irregularity about the R43 billion
       arms contract a real attempt is now being made to investigate it
       thoroughly;


  (2) the process will be completed thoroughly, but urgently, so that the
       damage that is being done to South Africa's image will be limited;
       and


  (3) the people identified by the investigation as having been negligent
       and/or having participated in fraud or any other offence will be
       removed from their posts immediately, and that the law will take its
       course to punish them for their deeds and for the damage which
       affects each person in this country.]

                RACIST ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JUDICIAL OFFICERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the serious racist allegations made by a father and his 18-year-
       old daughter against black judicial officers, as reported in the Cape
       Times of 13 November 2000;


  (2) deplores once more such blatant racist remarks;


  (3) believes that attitudes which tend to undermine black persons who are
       in responsible positions, should not be tolerated; and


  (4) welcomes and supports the initiative by the Judge President of the
       Cape in requesting the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute
       an investigation into the matter.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                           FIGHT AGAINST DIABETES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat vandag deur die Wêreldgesondheidsorganisasie verklaar
       is as Wêreldbewustheidsdag vir Diabetes;


  (2) sy dank en waardering uitspreek teenoor al die dokters,
       verpleegkundiges en ander gesondheidsorgwerkers wat vandag baie
       moeite doen by die meeste van die diabetesklinieke in ons land met
       die aanbieding van bewusmakingsprogramme en siftingstoetse op
       pasiënte;


  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat diabetes vandag 'n baie algemene siekte is en
       een van die hoofoorsake van bloedvaatsiektes, hartsiektes,
       hipertensie en blindheid is en dat talle diabeteslyers
       ongediagnoseerd rondloop;


  (4) sy lede aanmoedig om self toetse te ondergaan en om die lede van die
       gemeenskappe wat hulle bedien, bewus te maak van die gevare van die
       siekte en om hulle ook aan te spoor om vir vroeë toetse te gaan; en


  (5) die Departement van Gesondheid se aandag daarop vestig dat sekere
       klinieke nie deurentyd voldoende insulien voorrade tot hulle
       beskikking het nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today has been declared World Awareness Day for Diabetes
       by the World Health Organisation;


  (2) expresses its thanks and appreciation to all the doctors, nurses and
       other health care workers who are taking a lot of trouble today at
       most of the diabetic clinics in our country with the presentation of
       awareness programmes and with screening tests on patients;


  (3) notes that diabetes is a very common disease today and one of the
       main causes of arterial diseases, heart diseases, hypertension and
       blindness, and that many diabetes sufferers are walking around
       undiagnosed;
  (4) encourages its members to go for testing themselves and to make the
       members of the communities they serve aware of the dangers of the
       disease, and also to encourage them to go for early testing; and


  (5) draws the attention of the Department of Health to the fact that
       certain clinics do not always have sufficient insulin supplies at
       their disposal.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     RESPONSE TO FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) sy dank uitspreek teenoor die LUR van KwaZulu-Natal en sy Departement
       van Landbou vir hul optrede ten opsigte van die uitbreek van bek-en-
       klouseer in die provinsie;


  (2) verder erkenning gee aan die kommersiële landbouers vir hulle
       samewerking;


  (3) egter ook 'n beroep op die totale landbou- en sakegemeenskap van
       KwaZulu-Natal en die aangrensende provinsies Mpumalanga, die Oos-Kaap
       en die Vrystaat doen om mee te help dat die bekamping van die virus
       ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its thanks to the MEC of KwaZulu-Natal and his Department
       of Agriculture for their action with regard to the outbreak of foot-
       and-mouth disease in the province;


  (2) further pays tribute to the commercial farmers for their co-
       operation;
  (3) calls on the whole agricultural and business community of KwaZulu-
       Natal and the adjoining provinces of Mpumalanga, the Eastern Cape and
       the Free State, however, to co-operate to ensure that the control of
       ...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Yes, Mr Van Niekerk?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the hon MEC from KwaZulu-Natal is without
an apparatus to follow the translation of the motion. I think it is
apparent that he should listen to this motion.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am sure Dr Mkhize welcomes your kind
attention to his needs. I do not think Dr Conroy anticipated that the hon
the MEC would be here, nor did the House.

Dr E A CONROY: Shall I start at the beginning, Chairperson?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: No, please proceed, Dr Conroy. The hon the MEC
has indicated to me that he understands quite a good modicum of Afrikaans.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I continue:


       ... deur die inenting wat nou gaan begin, die afkordon van die
       betrokke gebiede en enige ander maatreëls suksesvol is;


  (4) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om sy aandag op hierdie ramp te fokus,
       hierdie natuurramp met die minimum burokrasie te beveg, die skade te
       help beredder en die landbouers in hierdie krisis by te staan; en


  (5) kennis neem daarvan dat die impak van die uitbreek reeds ernstig is,
       maar dat, indien dit nie spoedig onder beheer gebring word nie, dit
       katastrofaal vir al die mense in Suid-Afrika sal wees.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)


       [... by the inoculation which is about to begin, the cordoning off of
       the relevant areas and any other measures is successful;


  (4) calls on the Government to focus its attention on this disaster, to
       fight this natural disaster with the minimum of bureaucracy, to help
       address the damages and to assist the farmers in this crisis; and


  (5) notes that the impact of the outbreak is already serious, but that if
       it is not swiftly brought under control, it will be catastrophic for
       all the people of South Africa.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     CLEANING-UP OPERATION AT LAND BANK

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the dismissal of 12 Land Bank officials after a broad cleaning-
       up operation;


  (2) further notes that the cleaning-up operation has saved the
       institution R30 million;
  (3) commends the Land Bank for its swift action in exposing these corrupt
       elements; and


  (4) believes it reaffirms the commitment of Government to clamp down on
       corrupt elements in all state and semi-state institutions.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  APPEAL TO POLITICAL PARTIES TO ADHERE TO RULES DURING MUNICIPAL ELECTION
                                  CAMPAIGN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek stel voor sonder kennisgewing:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) hom uitspreek ten gunste van 'n vrye en regverdige plaaslike
       regeringsverkiesing op 5 Desember 2000;


  (2) die wens uitspreek dat alle deelnemende politieke partye en individue
       die kiesregulasies soos voorgeskryf ten nouste sal nakom en
       eerbiedig; en


  (3) met kommer kennis neem van naamlose plakkate waarop 'n bebloede
       Israeliese vlag uitgebeeld word en wat as deel van die
       verkiesingsveldtog gebruik word.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I move without notice -


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses itself in favour of free and fair local government
       elections on 5 December 2000;


  (2) expresses the wish that all participating political parties and
       individuals will closely comply with the electoral regulations as
       prescribed; and


  (3) notes with concern the nameless posters on which a bloodied Israeli
       flag is depicted and which are being used as part of the election
       campaign.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS BY MAYORAL CANDIDATE MR PETER MARAIS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the DA's mayoral candidate for the Cape Town unicity has
       been an embarrassment to himself, his party and the people of Cape
       Town with his recent irrational, irresponsible and delusional
       statements;


  (2) further notes that every time Mr Marais opens his mouth in public he
       puts his foot in it with statements that range from sexism, racism
       and anti-Semitism to egotism;


  (3) warns the people of Cape Town that the foot-and-mouth disease has
       spread to the Western Cape; and
[Laughter.]


  (4) recommends that Capetonians place Mr Marais and the DA under
       immediate quarantine until further notice and until the DA has taken
       Peter Marais' foot out of his mouth.

[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
[Interjections.]

Mr P J MARAIS (Western Cape): Chairperson, I would like to move a motion
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! No, sit down, hon member.

Mr P J MARAIS (Western Cape): ... that the ANC ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! No, Mr Marais. Mr Marais, you almost
did what Ms Ntwanambi was accusing you of, and I am not going to allow you
to do it in this House. [Interjections.] We move on then, hon members.
There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, on a point of order: The previous speaker
referred to the DA. According to your ruling there is no such party.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Dr Conroy, you know what? This
Chairperson tries to listen as carefully as possible, especially when Mr
Van Niekerk is in the House. The member, at the beginning of her motion,
which has now become notice of a motion, stated ``the DA candidate in the
forthcoming municipal elections''. [Interjections.] I think I need say no
more.

 INFLAMING OF PASSIONS DURING MUNICIPAL ELECTION CAMPAIGN AND NEED TO UPHOLD
                               ELECTORAL CODE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns without equivocation the blatant and inflammatory anti-
       Semitism evident in the illegal posters erected in the Western Cape,
       purportedly printed by the ``Friends of Palestine'';


  (2) asks all political parties publicly to dissociate themselves from the
       message carried by the posters;


  (3) supports repeated calls to the Northern Free State ANC ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, on a point of order: I am not
averse to the contents of the proposed motion, but such a motion was
already passed. A similar motion was passed by Mr Van Niekerk.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That is not a point of order.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, in terms of the Rules, if a
motion deals ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I will deal with it in terms of the
procedure, Mr Surty. Ms Botha, proceed.
Ms C BOTHA: Thank you, Madam Chair. I continue:


  (3) supports repeated calls to the Northern Free State ANC to reject the
       utterances of its Viljoenskroon ANC mayor and local government
       candidate who, over a loudhailer and in front of the homes of two DA
       candidates, ascribed the horrific deaths of a man in Sasolburg and a
       child in Bloemfontein to the ``boerepartye''; and


  (4) requests the Deputy President to reiterate the need for all political
       parties in the coming election to uphold the electoral code of
       conduct and also that all freely elected representatives heed the
       call of the Constitution to heal the divisions of the past and lay
       the foundation for a democratic and open society in which government
       is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally
       protected by law.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Ms Botha, I allowed you to read the
motion. The motion is very much the same in substance as a motion read a
few moments ago and agreed to by the House. I will look at both the content
of your motion and that of one previously read and adopted by the House,
and I will offer my ruling on whether we will allow any process with
respect to your motion when we meet here on 21 November 2000. I will not
deal with it at this time, but I believe I am correct in my assumption that
in fact a great deal of its substance, apart from the Viljoenskroon matter,
relates very closely, almost in exact wording, to a motion that we agreed
to a few moments ago. So I will not proceed to deal with it at this time,
but will address it on 21 November 2000.

Mr M BHABHA: Mr Chairperson, when considering this, the presumption that
being anti-Israeli is anti-Semitic is also incorrect.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Well, that is a matter you can all debate. I
will deal with the substance of the motion.

  FAILURE OF JOHANNESBURG STOCK EXCHANGE TO SEND REPRESENTATIVE TO AFRICAN
                STOCK EXCHANGE ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Madam Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with shock and dismay the failure of the Johannesburg Stock
       Exchange to send a representative to the African Stock Exchange
       Association's annual conference held in Abuja, Nigeria, last month;


  (2) recognises the institutional independence of the Johannesburg Stock
       Exchange, but is of the opinion that its non-attendance might be
       interpreted as a display of contempt for economic initiatives
       pioneered by the African continent;


  (3) recognises and applauds the positive gesture shown by Mr Mark
       Shuttleworth by attending the said conference at his own expense; and


  (4) calls upon all influential institutions like the JSE to display
       support and commitment to the upliftment of the African continent so
       as to accelerate the realisation of the African renaissance.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

      SUSPENSION OF BENNI MCCARTHY FROM INTERNATIONAL FOOTBALL MATCHES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) requests the South African Football Association (Safa) to speedily
       clarify the position regarding Bafana-Bafana star Benni McCarthy's
       suspension from international matches for allegedly having provoked
       the fans in Zimbabwe in a recent international match, resulting in
       unfortunate deaths and injuries;


  (2) regrets the fact that Fifa hastened to condemn Benni McCarthy on
       inconclusive evidence, especially in the light of the subsequent
       denial by Benni and his assertion that it was clearly a case of
       mistaken identity; and
  (3) notes that our superstar deserves unqualified support in his moment
       of agony and embarrassment, and pleads with Safa to resolve the issue
       with speedy resolve.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                               SUB JUDICE RULE

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, before proceeding, I come
to my promise of yesterday that I would relook at the point of order
relating to the sub judice rule which was raised by Mr Van Niekerk
yesterday. I had indicated that I would come back to this matter.

Members will recall that Rev Chabaku moved a motion without notice
regarding the issue of bail applications in general, and particularly the
speedy manner, in her view, with which certain bail applications were
processed recently.

Mr Van Niekerk asked whether her reference to the bail applications of the
six policemen was in contravention of the sub judice rule. I indicated
that, in my view, it was not, but that I would consider the substance of
the motion, look at the wording, and amend my ruling if necessary. I have
looked at the motion. The motion does not in any way expressly, either by
implication or concretely, comment upon the merits of the bail application
or on any other step in the prosecution of the six policemen. The sub
judice rule intends to address this matter in all jurisdictions. I
therefore confirm my view that the motion was not in contravention of the
sub judice rule.

The intention of the sub judice rule is there to prevent us as politicians
and members of Parliament from infringing on the independence of the
judiciary. It is not the intention of the sub judice rule to gag members of
Parliament. However, should we begin to reflect on the merits of a
particular court case, the direction it is taking and so on, we would then,
in that regard, begin to infringe the rule.

In this case, it was a comment on the speedy way in which the bail
application was dealt with, not an indication of support or negation of the
bail application, but the speed with which it was processed, and a call on
further bail applications to be dealt with in a similar manner.

Therefore, there was no imputation that could be construed as being sub
judice. That is my ruling, and I hope the House will accept it.

                       ADDRESS BY THE DEPUTY PRESIDENT

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: It is my pleasure to welcome the Deputy
President of the Republic of South Africa to the National Council of
Provinces once again. You are welcome, Deputy President. I also want to
welcome various colleagues from the provinces who have come here either
mandated by the provinces or led by the leaders of their delegations, the
premiers of our various provinces.

Deputy President, it is now my honour to call on you to address the House.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chairperson, hon premiers, hon members of the
House, I would like to begin my address to this House by formally
congratulating, once again, the Paralympic team on doing us proud at the
Paralympic Games in Sydney. I believe this is good news the country can
enjoy. I am saying this because I know we are very fond of depressing
ourselves in this country with the kind of news that is not very nice. It
is important to feel proud of what our South Africans have done.

I am happy to have the opportunity to address this House on the occasion of
its last full sitting. The uniqueness of the NCOP in bringing together the
national, provincial and local spheres of government under one roof is
evidence of co-operative governance at work. It is in this House that
provinces are able to share their experiences, so that we are all informed
as to what is taking place at all levels of government.

Indeed, hon members conduct their business in this House with the dignity
expected of public representatives who are here to represent the people. I
am aware that the Chairperson has personally visited no less than five of
our provincial legislatures in the course of this year. In the NCOP,
provincial governments, in particular, can learn from each other's
successes and challenges, and, in so doing, improve the quality of
governance and the pace of delivery to our people.
I note, as well, that the NCOP has amended a significant number of Bills
that have been tabled before it this year. This is, once again, clear
evidence of provincial governments and organised local government impacting
on the national legislative process. Hon members have not failed to carry
out their duties.

As we end this year it is worth noting some of the achievements that we, as
a country, have made. Among other things, South Africa, ably led by
President Mbeki, has firmly established itself and its presence within the
international community. This has been done in record time, if we take into
account the fact that we have only been formally admitted to the community
of nations in the past six years.

We have been invited to address all the major international conferences,
and have succeeded in putting across the views of the developing countries
and, more particularly, the views and the plight of the African countries.

We have succeeded in getting the developed countries to acknowledge that
steps need to be taken to reduce the debt burden of the developing
countries. We have set our country on the correct economic path.

Recently, the President hosted a meeting of 25 of the world's top
economists, including the World Bank president, James Wolfensohn. The
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Eduardo
Aninat, who was also at the meeting, remarked afterwards, and I quote:


  We are comforted with the degree of progress in relation to the
  macroeconomic side. The country is now in a new phase where it should
  continue to foster investment, increased growth and more jobs.

Whilst looking at our successes, we need to recognise that we still have a
lot of challenges. One of these is the moral degeneration of our society. I
addressed the National Assembly on 31 October 2000, and given the
importance of the matter, I would like to emphasise it again here. I quote
to the House from my address of that day. I said:


  To be able to address this challenge as a country, we cannot ignore the
  impact that our past has had on our present, for the apartheid legacy not
  only dehumanised some communities and individuals, but also caused untold
  damage in many ways.

I said that the previous Government ``introduced extreme intolerance and
because it had to be maintained through extreme violence, it encouraged
violence at every level of society''.

We were recently forced to confront the dehumanisation that I spoke about
in the National Assembly when, on our television screens, we saw horrific
footage of members of our Police Service setting their dogs upon three
defenceless and helpless men. The experience has shown us how certain
people in our society have lost respect for human dignity and human life.
It also showed us how members of our Police Service have been so mentally
brutalised by upholding apartheid that they have lost all sense of what is
right and what is wrong.

Our hearts go out to Gabriel and Alexander Ntimane, and their friend,
Sylvester Mathonsi, for the pain and trauma they suffered. Our hearts go
out also to the families and friends of their tormentors. Many of us will
not stop to think about this, but they find themselves having to confront
an ugly truth that their loved ones, who protect, love and nurture them,
are capable of inflicting such pain on other fellow humans.

Their acts traumatised not only their three victims shown in the video, but
also all people of our country.

Thus I believe that this has been a wake-up call to all South Africans like
we have seen at no other time before. I believe that the common rage
expressed by South Africans from all walks of life about a single act that
optimises, very distinctly, this scourge that we failed to collectively
agree on as a country in August, now ought to be channelled towards
bringing ourselves closer to each other as South Africans.

The work towards reconciliation that began in the early nineties and which
was given impetus by our first democratic election in 1994 cannot be
abandoned now. Indeed, we must build on it and together strive towards a
better society in South Africa.

I repeat the call I made to the National Assembly for South Africans to
embark on a major national campaign for moral renewal. We certainly need an
``RDP of the soul'', as former President Mandela said. I urge all
provincial legislatures and local governments to debate this matter of
moral degeneration and look at positive ways in which they can contribute
to this campaign of moral regeneration.

I believe that the majority of South Africans share our desire for a South
Africa that is free from the many challenges that face them. Unfortunately,
as a nation we are faced with another more deadly challenge of HIV/Aids.

I am encouraged by the work done by the provinces in fighting the pandemic.
Most have launched provincial Aids councils that will enable them to pool
together their efforts. We are encouraged also by reports which indicate
that our campaign against HIV/Aids is yielding results. South Africans are
beginning to take responsibility for their own lives and are changing their
behaviour.

As we move towards World Aids Day on December 1, we appeal to members of
this House and structures in all the provinces to assist us in taking the
anti-Aids struggle forward. Together we can beat the disease.

There are many challenges that we face. The hopes of our people are pinned
upon us as leaders in the different spheres of government and as public
representatives. We need to work together to address these challenges. The
cry from our people is clear. They are not interested in party-political
point scoring. They want development. They just want to be a nation, and
they want the scourge of HIV/Aids to be defeated.

In our political activity in this House and in our local government
electioneering we need to ensure that whatever we are doing is advancing
the interests of South Africa as a whole.

As public representatives we should identify key national priority issues
around which we must work to unite this country: the kind of issues that we
should agree not to play politics with, and around which we must
demonstrate patriotism in the process of our nation-building.

Similarly, the issue of traditional leadership is one that has taken centre
stage in recent times. I am happy to report that we met with the coalition
of traditional leaders yesterday. This meeting took place at the request of
the amakhosi to discuss the proposed Local Government: Municipal Structures
Second Amendment Bill. At the meeting, it was agreed that there would be
continuous interaction between Government and the amakhosi with a view to
finding common ground before the passage of the Bill by Parliament.

In line with the President's undertaking in this very House when he said
that to:


  ... ensure that we give real content to the objective contained in our
  Constitution to respect the institution of traditional leadership ...

a special Cabinet committee has been formed with the aim of continuing to
seek appropriate and long-lasting solutions to the matter of traditional
authority in our country.

Lastly, I would like to wish all political parties contesting the
forthcoming local government elections well. I also take this opportunity
to encourage all South Africans to exercise their hard-won right to vote
and help us build our local government structures.

I wish all members well during the coming holidays. The Minister of
Transport has asked me to appeal to all members this afternoon not to drink
and drive during the holidays.

I want to take this opportunity too, as the Chairperson of the SA National
Aids Council, to remind all South Africans of the ABCs of our campaign
against Aids: Abstain, Be faithful and, if all else fails, Condomise.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Chairperson, Deputy President and
hon members, the overwhelming majority of South Africans who voted in the
June 1999 elections said, without equivocation, that we should move with
more speed to change the lives of all South Africans for the better.

Every piece of legislation we pass, policy we formulate and programme we
implement is premised on that mandate.

What is more important for us is that the people should not wait until the
end of our mandate to ask what we did to fulfil that mandate. As they feel
the impact that our policies and programmes have on their lives, they will
make it known. They will let us know if we are veering off the course they
chose for the country. If we remain on course, they will encourage us to
move on.

Looking at the messages and responses we have been receiving regarding the
work that Government is doing in our province, I can say without doubt that
we remain on that course the people chose. This is what the people
themselves say, because they can already feel the positive impact of the
policies and programmes we have implemented during the period under review.

Mama Sarah Sekese, a 101-year-old pensioner from Vosloorus, had this to say
as she received the title deed to a house apartheid did not allow her to
own, and I quote:


  I have no more worries. I have a house and a home now. I have lived in so
  many houses in these 101 years, but now I have a home.

It is not through coincidence that we have responded positively to Mama
Sekese's wish, and others like her; it is because we are a caring
Government that responds to the needs of the poorest of the poor.

An awareness campaign on the devastating impact that HIV/Aids can have on
society has continued to enjoy top priority in Gauteng. This is a campaign
that demands the mobilisation of all citizens, Government and political
parties, and all sectors of our society. It demands the effective
implementation of a multipronged and comprehensive strategy of social
mobilisation, prevention, care and support.

Our policy and programmes are based on the thesis that HIV causes Aids. Our
awareness and prevention programmes are based on the ABC message. An
important focus in our efforts to prevent HIV/Aids has been the promotion
of safe sex and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted
diseases. There are early indications that our strategies are beginning to
work, and that there is a lot that we as Government, together with other
sectors, are doing right.

We are currently distributing over seven million condoms a month in
Gauteng. This is an increase of two million condoms since last year. The
steady increase in the demand for condoms means that the message ``abstain,
be faithful, wear a condom'' has started to get through.

Interventions through programmes in Carletonville are showing a decline in
STDs, a clear signal that our programmes are beginning to yield results.

We have introduced life skills programmes in all schools in Gauteng. We
have trained 350 trainers from district offices and they in turn have
trained educators in schools throughout the province. Every primary school
gets R1 000 and every high school R1 500 for specific HIV/Aids programmes.

We have set in place an integrated programme involving the Departments of
Health and Social Services, together with local government, NGOs and
community-based organisations to focus on home-based care for people living
with Aids and their families. Over 50 pilot projects are in operation and
have received an overwhelming response from the community, with religious
organisations and traditional healers playing a key role.

The challenge we continue to face is to ensure that people who are infected
with HIV/Aids and those suffering from Aids are not seen as outcasts in our
society. We have to create an environment for society to accept the fact
that ``my friend who is HIV-positive is still my friend''.

In addition to the existing pilot research projects at the Chris Hani
Baragwanath Hospital and Coronation Hospital in the province, focusing on
the prevention of mother-to-child transmission through the use of the
antiretroviral drug Nevirapine, the Premier's Committee on Aids in Gauteng
has decided to expand research sites to cover more hospitals and local
clinics in the province. These include Natalspruit, Leratong, Johannesburg
and Garankuwa Hospitals and local clinics in Vosloorus, Carletonville,
Hillbrow, Zondi and Soshanguve.

The province has, in addition to its health budget, set aside R25 million
from its own budget to ensure that we deal with the scourge of HIV/Aids.
While there are clear, positive signals on the horizon, we cannot for a
moment afford to be complacent.

The move in our province from hospital-based to clinic-based care as part
of the primary health care programme is proving to be a major success. At
least seven out of ten patients are now seen in clinics close to where they
live or work, as opposed to hospitals.

While the recent report of Statistics South Africa on poverty rated Gauteng
as the richest province in the country, the scourge of poverty remains our
biggest challenge. There remain many poor people in Gauteng, particularly
in informal settlements and rural areas, who still have no proper water
supply and sanitation.

Social security is one of the major poverty alleviation mechanisms. This
programme caters for an average of 380 000 people monthly, the majority of
whom are the elderly who receive old age pensions. While the target set for
us for the current financial year is 51 570 in terms of social child
grants, 95 491 children were receiving grants by the end of October, which
means we have already gone beyond our target for next year, which is
70 000.

As we promised, the processing of pensions and the time spent in long
queues has improved dramatically.

We know, though, that people want to be able to earn an income to support
themselves, their families and their communities. They want to be
economically active, they want skills, jobs and to own and run their own
enterprises.

In February this year, we announced 10 Gauteng spatial development
initiative projects, aimed at lifting the economy to a higher growth path
and creating the jobs that lie at the heart of our efforts to build a
better life. We set aside R1,2 billion from our own budget to deal with
this matter.

These projects represent a strategic intervention to reshape the economy
through realigning the manufacturing sector towards higher value-added
production and focusing on new growth sectors, in particular, ``smart''
industries such as IT and telecommunications and the development of
business services.

We are on track with the Gauteng rail link project, which will provide our
economy with a quality high-speed train to link Pretoria, Johannesburg and
the Johannesburg International Airport.

A range of steps we took since last year to deal with the problems in the
minibus-taxi industry have resulted in much-improved co-operation between
the taxi industry and the provincial government. The launch of the Gauteng
Taxi Council bears testimony to this. This marked a departure from a
culture of violence and all its related ills towards a culture of
engagement and a commitment to research for appropriate solutions.

I want to conclude by saying that there are three things that I thought
were important to make mention of. We share a strong commitment to working
for the success of the NCOP. This is the forum that provides us with an
opportunity to raise issues of key national concern and engagement.

However, increasingly, we are finding that the NCOP is programming its work
in such a way that, at times, the provinces are unable to make any
meaningful contribution based on proper mandates.

We know that it may have nothing to do with those who run the NCOP, but we
think it is important that the matter is addressed. We must ensure that we
stick with the agreed four-week cycles, and timeously involve and engage
the provinces on all work being processed by the NCOP.

The other issue that we want to raise, Comrade Deputy President, is that
while steps are being taken to ensure a multidisciplinary approach to
service delivery, more could be done, especially as concerns rural
development and the regeneration of urban areas such as Alex. We will soon
be making a proposal to the national Government on how all three spheres of
government can work together to radically change areas such as Alex in
Gauteng.

As I said at the beginning, the people themselves should, through their own
life experiences and on the basis of the impact of the policies, programmes
and all other initiatives that they have in their lives, tell us whether or
not we remain on the course they chose for our country. They are our main
opinion-makers. [Applause.]

Mr M L MUSHWANA: Mr Chairperson, hon Deputy President, this being the last
but one debate in this Chamber, and as a presiding officer doomed into a
corner of neutrality, I have decided to focus my debate on the NCOP as a
second Chamber of Parliament or, as it is conventionally called, the Upper
House.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!
Mr M L MUSHWANA: The status and identity of the NCOP have often been and
continue to be the subject of contradictions. At times, it is even
questioned and chastised by some of the very people who put it in place.
[Interjections.]

Recently, newspapers have been abuzz with statements such as ``The NCOP
lacks the oomph expected of an ``Upper House,'' and ``Members of the NCOP
are an inferior breed of politicians dumped in the House by their
respective parties; the best ones are consigned to the National Assembly.''
[Laughter.]

A certain Minister, quoted as ``anonymous'' in the press, is alleged to
have said that the NCOP is an unnecessary House, as by the time a Bill is
tabled in Parliament, the relevant Minister has already taken provincial
interests into account. The report goes on to say that the NCOP is failing
to perform its oversight function and that the system of special delegates
should be discarded. The litany of accusations goes on and on.

I do not intend to grace these foregoing allegations with a response at any
length. I believe NCOP members must implement the mandate of our
Constitution and must not in any way be expected to please specific
individuals who may be prejudiced against the NCOP. More so, if it is the
NCOP which has an oversight function over the executive and not vice versa,
any suggestion that the allegations I have referred to above emanate from
an audit report commissioned by the Department of Provincial and Local
Government and if, indeed, that is so - the author of the report is
ignorant of the provisions of the Constitution and, in particular, of the
national legislative processes. NCOP members are fully aware that the task
that faces them is more urgent and exacting.

I need to state that the NCOP is specifically tasked to promote and protect
provincial interest, and this they do by scrutinising national legislation
with a view to ensure that provincial interest is adequately catered for in
all legislation. Members of the NCOP ensure that provincial mandates are
incorporated into national legislation. In general, they ensure that all
legislation passed by Parliament is aligned to circumstances prevailing at
provincial level. The provincial tone and blend thus become the golden
thread that runs through all Acts of Parliament. After all, all people are
located within the provincial level, and therefore, these laws are
applicable to them.

The NCOP also provides a forum for public consideration of issues affecting
provinces. This task and function, if properly executed, ensures that
provinces and local governments, in a way, participate in the formulation
and shaping of national policies which affect them. In conformity with its
task of providing a forum for public consideration of issues which affect
provinces, the NCOP hosted a workshop, for instance, in response to the
flood disaster which ravaged our country. International experts on disaster
management attended this workshop. Provinces and the relevant departments
were also present, and thus provinces participated in the formulation of a
national policy on disaster management.

Yet another workshop was initiated and convened by the NCOP and, together
with the National Assembly, brought together all provinces at an SMME
workshop. Local and national governments were also represented. It is
important to note that prior to this workshop all provinces held public
hearings to solicit information and ideas on how best, and what steps
should be taken, to fast-track the development of SMMEs, which, for some
reasons, were not growing as fast as they should. The NCOP served as a co-
ordinator, as the Deputy President has correctly pointed out, and it is the
only Chamber which brings together all spheres of government.

The Constitution enjoins all spheres of government to maintain a certain
level of co-operation and to maintain sound relationship with one another.
The concept of co-operative governance as enshrined in our Constitution is
best realised within the NCOP. The NCOP can aptly be said to be the citadel
of co-operative governance.

Let us look at interventions in terms of section 139. These interventions
are sanctioned and supervised by the National Council of Provinces. The
NCOP approves or disapproves interventions in terms of section 139, and it
decides and recommends when interventions should end or be continued.
During the past three years there have been a number of such interventions
which the NCOP carried out excellently. Since then, about seven
interventions have been made and better relationships established within
municipalities.

Let me mention a few activities in which the NCOP also engaged regarding
which it could be said to be helping in the formulation of national
policies and creating a forum where provinces shared views and ideas. For
instance, debates were held on topics such as the promotion of
multiligualism in a democratic South Africa, an integrated programme for
land distribution and agricultural development in South Africa, provincial
perspectives on challenges regarding and efforts towards reconciliation and
nation-building, racial attacks and many other similar topics.

Finally, looking at the SA Local Government Association, the NCOP also
provides a forum where local government is able to participate.

There are some difficulties which the NCOP still faces, but it is important
to note that although the NCOP is considered redundant as some would see it
- I want to highlight this point - the NCOP has effected some amendments,
even to section 75 legislation. For instance, in the period 1997 to date, a
total of 37 amendments have been effected by the NCOP. Of these, the
National Assembly accepted 35.
Amendments to section 76 legislation from the period 1997 to date totalled
25. Of these, the National Assembly accepted 23. Recently, the NCOP
suggested amendments to tourism legislation, about 11 of them. When the
matter was taken to mediation, nine of the amendments suggested by the NCOP
were accepted. Therefore, those who think that the NCOP is a redundant
House must, I think, look for faults somewhere else. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I call upon Mr P J Marais to address
the House. [Interjections.] Order! Order!

Mr P J MARAIS (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon members, for so many years
the majority of South Africans had the impression that they were merely
tenants in this country, and a lot of us sitting here have set out and made
it our job to change that. That time is now past. We are no longer tenants.

It is now time for the South African people to free themselves from the
past and build a future worth having: a future free of poverty, free of
hunger, free of disease, free from economic starvation; a future where the
reality of Aids is realised by the central Government, and countered with
the same vigour as we countered apartheid. We can do that. I have just
heard the hon Premier of Gauteng mention their successes in fighting HIV.
He is active, he is doing something about it. He is not blaming anybody. He
says: ``I am going to do it.''

Do hon members know that 4,2 million people were HIV-positive in South
Africa at the end of 1999? In the Western Cape, 7,17% of the people are HIV-
positive. A total of 5 000 babies who are HIV-positive are born here every
month.

We desperately need to build a future where free people will live free
lives in dignity and in security: free from hunger, free from disease, free
from poverty. This future can be ours if the Government of the day realises
that people from other political parties than its own are also citizens and
also patriots, and should share in the wealth of this country. Let us
change our approach in whatever we do: the way we approach Aids and HIV,
the way we approach legislation, the way we respect those who lead us, and
especially the way we approach our politics.

Let us, once and for all, do it for all the people. The wealthy too have a
role: They create the jobs. It is the wealthy that can invest. They build
the factories, they build the restaurants, they invest, they create the
jobs.

We in the Democratic Alliance empower the unemployed to become
entrepreneurs. It is as simple as that. I believe that every family should
give birth to an entrepreneur. Government talks about skills training
programmes and youth empowerment, but unfortunately so far it has been all
talk and no action.

There are about 1 000 new people entering the job market in South Africa
every day, yet our economy ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Marais, please take your seat. What
is the point of order?

Mr M V MOOSA: Madam Chair, is it in order for the member to make exactly
the same speech every time he comes to the NCOP? [Laughter.]

Mr P J MARAIS: Madam Chair, in terms of the Rules of this House ...
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Marais, please hold on and allow me
to respond.

Mr Moosa, that is not a point of order. Could members please desist from
making spurious points of order! We have a very long debate to get through.
Members could encourage other members to make their particular views known,
if they would like to, or ensure that they are on the speaker's list.

Mr Marais, you may continue.

Mr P J MARAIS: Madam Chair, if he did not speak, we would have thought that
he is ignorant and stupid. Now he has confirmed that by speaking.
[Interjections.] I said that there are about 1 000 new people entering the
job market in South Africa every day, yet our economy is losing jobs at an
average of 408 per day. We are losing this fight against unemployment. We
must change our approach.

Let me quote what was reported in the media this week: ``Not one cent of
the R855 million in the Umsombumbu Fund has yet been spent.''
[Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: Umsobomvu Fund!

Mr P J MARAIS: What is in a name? [Laughter.] It is a fact that the ANC
laughs when people are starving. That is a joke! I am saying that R855
million of a fund set up to fight poverty has not been spent. I expected
them to cry, but there is laughter. What has happened to the R240 million
raised by the National Lottery so far? Why has it not been spent on
poverty? When are they going to spend the R455 million worth of poverty
relief funds that remain unspent nationally in the 1999-2000 Welfare
budget? The poor are waiting; they are restless, but those members are
laughing. We have to change our approach.

I am glad that the Deputy President has addressed the issue of morality and
the moral degeneration of our society. I would like to thank him for that.
Yes, apartheid has dehumanised people. Yes, we have to change that. But how
do we start? When do we start with this new revolution of the mind?

I was once criticised for saying that if I had to choose on moral issues, I
would choose what the Bible says. The Constitution permits what the Bible
forbids. It is as simple as that. It does not say that one must not do this
or that, and it also does not say that one cannot do it, but it permits it.
The Bible forbids some of these things, and as a Christian I have to choose
on moral grounds. And I stand by that.

But the same people who accuse me of not being true to the Constitution,
which I respect, do not uphold section 27(b) of the very Constitution,
which states that, and I quote:


  Everyone has the right to have access to sufficient food and water.

You have given me water, but where is the food? [Laughter.]

It states in subsection 2, and I quote:


  The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its
  available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of each of
  these rights.

They are sitting with R1,5 billion in total which they have not spent. So
they have the resources, but they make a big fuss about free water. I ask
them: why do they not read the whole sentence in the Constitution? Where is
the food?

No department in Government is charged directly with monitoring or ensuring
the realisation of the right to food. The Department of Agriculture has
reported that - and I want to quote from the Human Rights Commission report
here - it ``does not consider itself responsible for household food
security''.

In addition, the Department of Agriculture argues that, and I quote:


  The right of access to food does not necessarily mean that Government
  should see to it that every citizen has food to eat every day.

[Interjections.] The quotation comes from this commission's report.

A further question which is begging the point is that although the same
section 27 clearly states that, and I quote:


  Everyone has the right to have access to social security, including, if
  they are unable to support themselves and their dependants, appropriate
  social assistance ...

And subsection 2 says:


  The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures within its
  available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of each of
  these rights.

What plans do they have in place for the women who have children over the
age of seven when the current grant maintenance system ends in March next
year?

An HON MEMBER: Nothing! [Interjections.]

Mr P J MARAIS: These are the challenges. The Deputy President's Government
said that only children up to the age of seven years old will get the grant
- not higher than seven. What plans do they have in place to ensure that
those children have food?  [Interjections.]

Mr T B TAABE: Madam Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?
Mr P J MARAIS: I will not answer any questions, Madam Chairperson. That is
just a ploy to take away my time. I asked, what plans does this Government
have in place for those 54 000 women in the Western Cape alone who will
lose their maintenance grant during March next year? Are they getting any
income now?

An HON MEMBER: That is a blatant lie.

Mr P J MARAIS: They are either not upholding the Constitution or they
simply do not have these women at heart. [Interjections.]

Is it because the present Government has also fallen into the trap of the
previous dispensation, where they simply believe they cannot do anything
wrong? They have also fallen into the trap of thinking that they cannot
make a mistake; they cannot do anything wrong, even if people starve.
Because they have done it, it must be right.

Government has a responsibility to act first for all the people in this
country before acting for other people in other countries. They can find
money very quickly to send people on an excursion into Lesotho. They can
find money very quickly to go to the Congo. But if we ask for money to give
the poor food, they tell us ... iphelile [ ... it is finished].
Interjections.]

Hon MEMBERS: Uyaxoka wena [You are lying].

Mr P J MARAIS: Chairperson, charity begins at home, and it shows in the
Western Cape. Cape Town is our mother city - a microcosm of this country.
It is a talked-about town. It is a city of culture, a city of joy, a city
of people, and we believe that we can make it a city of opportunities.
[Interjections.]

Who are the people of Cape Town? How can we recognise them? If those
members think that there is anybody in the ANC that I am scared of debating
with, then they do not know me. [Interjections.]

I am sure that they are feeling the hurt of my words. [Interjections.] And
although what I am saying is right, the ANC has become fat cats who do not
care about the poor. [Interjections.] They have become the fat cats of this
country and that is why they are making all this noise. [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members! Mr Marais, would you stop
for a moment. Could I advise you to address the Chair with your comments.

Mr P J MARAIS: Madam Chairperson, I will address the Chair gladly. These
things that I am talking about upset me.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Your time is still on. You will have
your time. Could I ask you to address the Chair? And could I also ask hon
members to allow the member to speak? Proceed, Mr Marais.

Mr P J MARAIS: Madam Chairperson, I knew that I would come here and make an
impression! [Interjections.]

We cannot retain our infant political freedom if more than half of our
people are enslaved by poverty. It is as simple as that. No matter how much
one boasts about how one has been in jail or on Robben Island, if one's
people starve, if one's people are hungry, where is their freedom? [Time
expired.]

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, it is a privilege to speak after the
sanctimonious, Bible-punching, provincial MEC who pretends that he has the
Constitution at heart and yet publicly proclaims that we should dismiss
this Constitution and choose the Bible. We ask him: What about his Jewish
colleagues, what about his Hindu colleagues, what about his Muslim
colleagues? The speaker reminds one of Rip Van Winkle. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Surty, would you take your seat? Hon
members and Mr Marais, I am presiding. I do not need your assistance to
maintain order in this House. Mr Ackermann, do you have a point of order?

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Mevrou die Voorsitter, ek wil graag hê dat die Stoel na
die toespraak tot dusver van mnr Surty sal kyk. Die aantygings wat hy maak,
is oor sekere uitlatings van mnr Marais uit 'n bybelse oogpunt, wat mnr
Surty se eie interpretasie weerspieël, en ek vra dat die Stoel asseblief
hierdie aantygings moet ondersoek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Mr Chairperson, I would like the Chair to have a look at
Mr Surty's speech thus far. The allegations which he is making is about
certain remarks Mr Marais made from a biblical point of view, which
reflects Mr Surty's own interpretation and I ask the Chair to please
investigate these allegations.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Ackermann, with due respect, that is
not a point of order. Mr Surty, proceed.

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, I trust I will get injury time for the innate
and inane interjection by Mr Ackermann.

Perhaps I should congratulate Mr Marais for being given the dubious award
of ``mampara of the week.'' [Laughter.] He has made this very, very clear.
He reminds ... [Interjections.] This is what he would do. He does not give
anybody else an opportunity to speak, while we gave him the benefit of
addressing this House. I think he should preserve the dignity of this
House. [Interjections.]

Mr Marais has said quite publicly that the Constitution was written by
communists. He is very much like Rip Van Winkle who slept through a social
and political revolution while the entire world watched in all great
amazement at this very transparent participatory process, where NGOs, civil
society, all political parties including his own - the New NP and its
alliance partner, the DP - were participated. They were part and parcel of
a process that was public and which endured for a period of two years. That
is the Constitution that was regarded as the birth certificate or the soul
of the nation.

That is the Constitution to which Mr Marais as a public representative had
sworn allegiance and loyalty. That is the Constitution that every public
representative should respect. As a public representative who shows
contempt for and no loyalty to the Constitution and the supreme law of the
land, we are amazed that his party is neither censuring him or that he even
retains the position of a political office bearer. It is rather
disappointing that such a man, who has no respect for the supremacy of this
Constitution here, would now want to assume the office of mayor of this
beautiful city. [Interjections.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Mr Marais has put his foot in his mouth. [Laughter.]

Mr M E SURTY: I think that is an appropriate comment that has been made by
my colleague. I will not address a wounded cowboy who shoots blanks all the
way, sitting on a lame ass and hobbling towards the sunset. [Laughter.] I
think the braying of an ass is usually ignored. [Laughter.] I will devote
my attention to what I have come to this House to do and that is to speak
... [Interjections.]

Mr P J MARAIS (Western Cape): Make a credible speech for once in your life!

Mr M E SURTY: Mr Marais has not had the benefit ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Proceed, Mr Surty.

Mr M E SURTY: Thank you, Chairperson. I will address the Chair.

On behalf of the Premier of the North West, Mr Popo Molefe, I would like to
convey his apologies for not being here. He is engaged and participating in
the legislative programme of the North West.

We are heartened to hear and listen to the Deputy President raise issues
that have, in fact, been dealt with in this House. He has quite pertinently
raised the issue of racism. We would like to draw his attention to the fact
that, unlike Mr Marais, this House has sought, in a very constructive and
concerted way, to draw political parties from across the spectrum to deal
with issues that confront this nation in a focused and united way. It was
only on Thursday last week that all political parties and provinces shared
and supported a motion, quite universally, condemning the racism and
brutality of the people in the Police Service who assaulted and unleashed
vicious dogs on three black persons.

This reflected that this nation and its public representatives, unlike what
Mr Marais is trying to portray, are capable of uniting against the demon of
racism. [Interjections.] Now the North West province has had the ability
... Mr Marais, you seek to interject whenever I speak. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Surty, please address the Chair.

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, we, too, have experienced racism in the North
West province at the Stella police station. As was clearly reflected in the
electronic and print media, we had clear evidence of racism within the
Police Service. The government of the North West immediately intervened and
ensured that the police station was appropriately transformed.

We all know in this Council of the difficulties, battles and challenges
racism poses to the community of Vryburg. Again, the government of North
West is faced with a particular challenge, not only in changing the
mindsets of the youth and the teachers, but also those of the parents. The
Department of Education is taking appropriate steps to ensure that they
inculcate in the children a respect and a tolerance for each other in order
to ensure that our schools are integrated and, particularly, to ensure that
governing bodies play an appropriate role in ensuring the enhancement and
development of our children in that they promote a culture of nonracialism
and nonsexism.

In regard to the issue of traditional authorities, we are proud to
announce, through the House of Traditional Leaders, that we have been able
to maintain good relationships of mutual respect in which traditional
leaders respect the competencies and authority of government and,
government, likewise, respects the competencies of traditional leaders. We
have been in continual engagement with traditional leaders, and we are
proud to say that the North West province is one of the areas in which
relationships between traditional leaders and the government can be
regarded as excellent.

In regard to HIV/Aids, the North West government has dealt with the matter
at three levels. It has dealt with HIV/Aids in terms of a programme of
action at local government and at a regional level, focusing particularly
on the rural areas where many of our men and women are afflicted by
HIV/Aids, and then at provincial level.

The programme of the North West province has aligned itself with the
National Aids Council of South Africa. The mandate that has been given is
to give advice to provincial governments on HIV/Aids and sexually
transmitted diseases; to involve all sectors of civil society in the
implementation of programmes of Government; to monitor and co-ordinate the
implementation of programmes and strategies of national Government; to
create and strengthen an awareness in society, to focus particularly on the
rural areas and to ensure also that the programme of HIV/Aids is carried
through to our schools and learning institutions.

It is rather unfortunate that nowhere in any public statement or on any
poster of the Democratic Alliance have we seen poverty or the poor being
referred to, or reflected. Now, for the first time, Mr Marais notices that
there is one uniform message of the ANC, which states that irrespective of
whether one lives in Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, Rylands or anywhere else,
together we can accelerate change and fight against poverty.

That is the statement that has touched the soul of this nation, because it
is not contradictory. The ANC does not conveniently put up posters in
Clifton which say: ``Fight against rates,'' and not put them up in Rylands,
because one knows that the people in Rylands are paying for the rates of
those residents in Clifton. [Interjections.] One does not see that.

Now poverty becomes an issue for the first time for the Democratic
Alliance. This is total and blatant hypocrisy. [Interjections.] I think Rip
van Winkle slept through a social and political revolution, and has now
discovered that there is a new democratic dispensation and cannot come to
grips with the nonracialism and the nonsexism. To give hon members an
example, looking at the chairpersons of the district councils in the Cape,
of the 30 candidates 25 are white and four are coloured, while 25 of those
whites and coloureds are male, and one is a white female. This is the
extent of nonracialism and nonsexism that is practised by the DA.

They want to tell us, ``We are living in a nonracial and nonsexist
dispensation.'' [Interjections.] They want to tell us, in this Chamber,
``We care for the poor,'' with the legacy that they have brought to this
House. They say, ``We want to look after our wealthy,'' quite categorically
and strategically, and ``We are not concerned about the poor,'' and now
they pretend. They quote the Constitution for their benefit. They utilise
the Bible for their benefit, for their political gain. They have no regard
for religion. They have absolutely shown contempt for the Constitution.

People like Mr Marais, who mislead this House and who treat women with
contempt, do not deserve a place in the service of the public as public
representatives. If he had the courage of his convictions, if he was a man,
he would then say, ``Miss Lynne Brown, we are willing to engage in
debate.'' [Interjections.] When things become hot he either shouts like a
lunatic or, alternatively, he walks away from a meeting. [Interjections.]

We, as the ANC, have had our say. We will continue unashamedly and publicly
to be committed to the transformation of the people in our country,
committed to the eradication of poverty and to the upliftment of the
quality of life of our people. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, Deputy President, it need not be argued and
proved that a developing country needs the talent, the expertise and the
dedication of all its people. It is particularly true for South Africa
where a dream was born: a dream of an African renaissance.

To succeed, to create the birth of a wave of development that will flow
over to the other states in Africa will require South Africa to harness all
its reserves and potential in human resources. Are we doing just that? Are
we really retaining our human resources that can really act as stimuli for
the birth of the African renaissance? [Interjections.] Let me be not just
blunt, but honest. The answer is a simple, but clear no. [Interjections.]

Van ons beste breinkrag, in die besonder in die geledere van ons jongmense,
is besig om ons land in hulle hordes te verlaat. Dit is 'n harde
werklikheid dat daar onder ons jongmense 'n groeiende benadering is om
hulle heil elders te gaan soek. Het iemand hulle al gekonfronteer en gevra
hoekom dit die geval is? Het die agb Adjunkpresident hom dit al afgevra
waarom dit so is?

'n Mens sal by baie mense oppervlakkige antwoorde kry wat seker dit sou
toeskryf aan die wittes wat nie wil aanpas nie. As agb lede dit glo, is hul
ver van die waarheid af. Nee, alle jongmense soek 'n toekoms waar hulle
aanvaar sal word vir wat hulle is, vir hoe hulle presteer en waar meriete
die enigste maatstaf is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Some of our best brainpower, particularly among the ranks of our young
people, is leaving our country on a large scale. It is a harsh reality that
one increasingly encounters an approach among our young people of seeking
their fortune elsewhere. Has anyone yet confronted them and asked them why
this is the case? Has the hon the Deputy President asked himself why this
is happening?

One will receive superficial answers from many people who will probably
attribute this to the whites who do not want to adapt. If hon members
believe that, they are far from the truth. No, all young people seek a
future in which they will be accepted for who they are, for how they
perform, and where merit is the only yardstick.]

The DP supports the principle of affirmative action. It is imperative that
special programmes assist previously disadvantaged people to rise to, and
achieve, their maximum potential. It is in the interest of South Africa and
the very future that I am pleading for.

However, if some are advantaged simply on the basis of quotas or because if
preference is given on grounds of race or background, South Africa sinks
back once more into the morass of discrimination. It is exactly this that
causes talented young people to seek their future elsewhere.

Dan is daar natuurlik nog 'n rede vir die negatiewe benadering tot ons
toekoms. Ek verwys hier na die geweld en die misdaad wat ons onder die
voorstes in die wêreld in hierdie kategorie plaas. As roof, verkragting,
kapings en marteling 'n deel van ons daaglikse bestaan geword het, as
hierdie dinge voortduur, kan niemand verwag om lojale, toegewyde en
optimistiese landsburgers te sien nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Then, of course, there is another reason for the negative approach to our
future. Here I am referring to the violence and crime which are placing us
among the forerunners in the world in this category. When robbery, rape,
hijacking and torture have become part of our existence, when these things
continue, no one can expect to see loyal, dedicated and optimistic citizens
in our country.]

We all witnessed with horror the ghastly scenes of savagery on our
television screens those of police dogs and so on. Of course, we all
condemn that in the strongest possible way, but tonight members can watch
Special Assignment on their television screens, and they will see those
dogs attacking a white person. So, after all, it was merely ...
[Interjections.] So, this was not a brutal racist incident. The crucial
point is to find a way of creating a kind of society where such incidents
do not occur.

There are the symptoms of a sick society. In my view, it all has an effect
on the loyalty of South Africans. The Government cannot buy loyalty from
its citizens. One must earn loyalty and support.

Ms L BROWN (Western Cape): Madam Chairperson, hon Deputy President and hon
colleagues, little did I think in 1994, as we were entering our various
democratic legislatures, that I would be standing here today and calling
for a revolution. For that is what we need in this country, a revolution of
the mind, the spirit and the soul.

Our transition to democracy - a goal for which we fought so hard in a
struggle to which we lost parents, brothers, sisters, and friends - is in
danger of being soured by the lack of care in our society. This lack of
care, dignity, and pride in our own worth as human beings, manifests itself
as lawlessness, cruelty, and abuse.

The other day I visited a pension pay-out point, and a group of pensioners
was having a monthly meeting. They opened with prayers and in their prayers
they prayed for chairs to sit on so that they would not have to stand for
long hours in the cold and in the heat.

This is not a big thing for our parents, our aunts and uncles to ask for.
This is not a big request to place at the doorstep of the MEC for Social
Services. This is a small step that we could take to at least show a little
bit of care for the elderly. Is it not something that every community could
not assist in - providing for those who have cooked our food for years, who
nursed us when we were young, and cared for us and our children? So often
we hear the rich cry: ``Tell us how we can help you.'' But when one points
out the way, they close their hands.

We need to build a society that cares, not only for itself, or for those in
their prime, but also for those who should be resting after a long journey.
But a society cannot build care if it does not have pride in its past,
present and in its future - its children. Our past is obscured in the
ravages of exploitation and slavery, which played such a cruel role in
destroying our heritage. The cries of slaves echo in the flagstones of the
streets around this very House. It is time for all of us to confront and
embrace that past.

Whether we were the slaves or the owners, the victims or the victors, the
invader or the invaded, in our past lies our salvation, for in our future
lies our hope.

Those who are descendants of the victors, the invaders and conquerors carry
a terrible burden for which they must not be punished. But it is only when
they acknowledge that burden, when they admit and reject the sins of the
past, and when the daughters and sons of the vanquished take their hands
and help them cleanse the blood, joining together in a dance of hope, that
our souls will be cleansed.

This century has not been kind to our land. We have seen communities
destroyed by greed. We have seen people forced out of their homes, and we
have seen the spirits of our people broken. And now that the chains of
division have been cast aside, instead of a commitment to the good of our
nation, we see a horrible greed and selfishness and a quest for the shining
idols of the consumer society. We see children who demand that their
mothers use their meagre savings to buy them designer clothes. We see the
gods of soap operas replacing the good of our people.

Some of us go to church on Sunday and we feel good because we praise the
Lord. But when we go home, we close our hearts to the stranger standing at
the gate. We turn our heads the other way when a child clutches at our
sleeve or runs to our car window. We forget that these children who live on
our streets are our own. They are our own children whom we have forgotten
to feed. We cannot put the blame on anyone but ourselves. We live in a
province that runs itself, a province that has to take care of itself. We
live in a country that runs itself, and we cannot blame each other for
these problems. We have to take responsibility for them, because every
child belongs to anyone who is a parent.

Those who deny that our society has terrible racial divides have their
heads buried in the sand. In the city there are citizens who never cross
the lines that divide where the haves and the have-nots live. Many of these
divides, the highways that transverse our city, are as impregnable as the
Berlin Wall.

Those who say that they want to change things or want to play a role, but
do not know how, I will tell them how. They should get into their cars and
visit pension queues in the townships and see the poverty in which our
grandmothers and grandfathers live. I am sure that they will find something
that they can contribute to make their pain a little easier.

As the Deputy President has correctly said, the television footage that
shocked our nation last week was a clarion call for all of us, whatever our
political allegiance, religion or race. All of us who claim to care for the
good of our society should raise our voices in one song to fight for a just
society and a caring society that is united in its diversity and its pride.
[Applause.]

Mr N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Deputy President, colleagues,
it is a pleasure to follow on such a cool, calm and collected speaker.
[Applause.]

Firstly, I would like to apologise on behalf of my Premier who had another
commitment and was unable to be here with the Council today.
[Interjections.] That member should forget about the plane. What about all
the planes that they had in their day when they were running government?
[Interjections.]

When I got here earlier on this afternoon, I really thought that both my
colleague and I, the hon MEC for health, Dr Mkhize, would have a quarantine
area in which hon members would put us. I am glad to see that the House is
reserving the quarantine area for other hon members of this Council.
[Laughter.]

I am also not surprised that the theme that ran through the address of the
Deputy President was delivery and development. I think between the Deputy
President, my colleague and I, we have one third of the former KwaZulu-
Natal cabinet here in the Council today. We are very pleased that a product
of KwaZulu-Natal today sits in the second highest office in the land. We
used to tease the hon Deputy President before he was appointed that one day
he would be in such high places, and we hope he does not look down upon us.
Certainly, he does not do that.

We are all faced with the fact that poverty in our provinces is at an
unacceptably high level and is driven by changes in the economy that have
brought about lower rates of employment. I believe that we need not burden
each other with statistics because we know that whatever the exact levels
of poverty are, it is a gross phenomenon of such seriousness that suffering
and deprivation are part of our national character.

I also do not wish to debate causes, because our role is to look to the
future rather than to repeat the reasons that the economists regularly
provide. We can therefore, I believe, spend our time together most
profitably if we share thoughts on strategies to address the challenges of
development that we face. It is in respect of the strategies that we must
be ruthlessly honest with ourselves.

Development requires capacity in our administrations that we do not always
have to the extent and levels that we need. All of us will remember the
controversy that arose a few months ago when it was reported in the media
that a department had not been able to spend aid funding for poverty
relief. The real situation was more complex than the media reported, but it
remains relevant to my point.

Among the official responses, the point was made that the department
concerned had a shortage of personnel who could design and supervise
special programmes. All of us experience this constraint to some or other
degree. We cannot set goals for ourselves when we may not have capacity, at
this point, to implement them adequately. I will return to this point in
due course.

Having thought about the problems of poverty and development in our region
very intensively, I have come to the conclusion that we should make a very
careful distinction between levels of strategy. I would like to respond to
the question relating to the Department of Agriculture because I am an
integral part of agriculture. I would like to say that the cornerstone of
the agricultural programme that we have in the province and which the
national department shares with us is one of food security. Hence, we, in
our province, have launched a programme called Xoshindlala. I think that it
is unwise for us to read reports of 1997 and 1998 and say that that is the
current thinking in our department. The current thinking in the Department
of Agriculture both at provincial and national level is, certainly, food
security.

The distinction that I would like to make is between what I will call base
strategy and action strategy. There are other terms that I could use, but
these will suffice. In the base strategy, we have to consider that our
populations, particularly in rural areas, require to be liberated from
factors that undermine their own energy and capacity to participate in
their own development. Here I refer to the fact that preventative health
care, the supply of potable water, housing where it is needed, electricity,
adequate roads and transportation facilities, educational services, well-
targeted welfare support and the like, are necessary before people in
communities are, to an extent, freed from burdens that puncture their
motivation and self-reliance. They develop an image of themselves as people
who need rather than people with goals and ambitions. Without these basic
supports, our rural populations face the world and Government as
supplicants rather than as partners in their own development.

In this base strategy, our administrations at central, provincial and local
government level have to shoulder the major burden of delivery. We have to
struggle to ensure that our efforts are as co-ordinated, efficient, well-
managed and monitored as possible. We will run into capacity problems again
and again, but the training and capacity-building that we have to provide
is internal. We cannot escape it. We have to overcome our constraints
regarding the poor.
Regarding the second level of strategy, the action strategy, to my mind,
requires a different approach. While we know what the challenges are that
we have to address in our administrations, we do not necessarily know what
to inject into our poor rural populations to help them to become prouder
and more self-reliant.

I want to submit that we are not necessarily experts on what they need to
become active partners in their own renaissance and prosperity. I am
suggesting that, regarding SMME training, rural production techniques, crop
choices, marketing small-scale produce and the like, we need to involve and
enter into partnerships with NGOs, professional agencies and the private
sector.

The skill that we, as Government, will have to have is how to manage and
supervise these partnerships. As we all know, there are many unscrupulous
operators who are ever ready to exploit state contracts for quick wealth.

Sound development is always multifaceted and integrated, and the need is
for more comprehensive partnerships. This is the nettle we have to grasp.
To this end, I am pleased to announce that we in KwaZulu-Natal have an
integrated rural development strategy. This is the result of a two-year
process which culminated in a White Paper. I am glad to announce that all
departments work within the framework of this strategy and that there is co-
ordination at all levels.

I would like to use the next few minutes to deal with an issue that looms
large and threateningly in KwaZulu-Natal, and that is the outbreak of foot-
and-mouth disease in the Camperdown district. At this stage I want to thank
Dr Conroy - I see he is out of the Chamber - for the motion that he
presented earlier. I want to thank him very much. It is certainly very
unlike some of his colleagues in the DA, if I may use that term with the
Chair's permission, who have criticised Government for the way we have
approached this. I think some of these people are trying their old
politicking with it. I want to assure this Council that both the national
Minister and I have been informed by decisions taken by the professional
veterinarians in this regard. We as political heads of departments have
provided all the support that is necessary to our veterinarians to be able
to contain and eradicate the disease.

I do not think I have to tell this House, because hon members are probably
aware, that about a third of the area of the province, roughly two million
hectares, has now been cordoned off to become a foot-and-mouth vaccination
zone. This includes the two major cities and some of KwaZulu-Natal's most
productive farmland. There will be financial consequences because meat and
dairy products may no longer be moved in or out of this new zone.

Exports of meat and dairy products from this zone to other countries are
not significant, but the restrictions do mean markets in other provinces
are closed off for the time being. We would like hon members, the media and
role-players out there to understand that the campaign against foot-and-
mouth disease is being waged in the most difficult circumstances imaginable
- small commercial farms merging into unfenced communal areas, mountainous
terrain, a network of footpaths and roads, and the country's major national
highway driving straight through the disease's epicentre.

One of the members of the so-called DA said on radio a few weeks ago that -
it was Dr Fry ... Kraai ... Sorry, maybe I said Fry; it was Dr Kraai van
Niekerk. The Freudian slip might be the correct thing to have happened. Dr
Kraai van Niekerk, a member of Parliament in the National Assembly, called
for a state of emergency. I believe that this is a kneejerk instinct for
authoritarian measures, no doubt acquired under the pre-1994 regime. We
prefer to operate within the Animal Diseases Act, which provides veterinary
authorities with every power needed to combat the spreading of foot-and-
mouth disease.

We are determined to succeed in preventing further spreading of the
infection and we reiterate our full support to the veterinary teams in the
field and all those who are giving them back-up.

May I also indicate that we have tremendous support from the national
Department of Agriculture, from all the provinces for that matter. Every
province responded to the call of KwaZulu-Natal in sending down
veterinarians, animal health technicians and other personnel who could
assist. The SANDF have provided over 800 members on the ground, and metro
police and other authorities have also provided personnel. I believe it is
through working together as Government, as various stakeholders, that we
can overcome this hurdle.
May I also add that we have received support from organised agriculture.
They have been really supportive of all the measures that we have taken so
far ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Deputy President Zuma, hon special delegates
and colleagues in the House, hon Deputy President Zuma propounded some of
the major areas of concern confronting South Africans, and broadly sketched
how the Government responded to some of the issues and what it would like
other parties to do in confronting the challenges.

Here I hasten to congratulate and compliment the hon the Deputy President
for his call on all parties to work together. He has set the right tone and
I express the hope that the different parties that will be fighting the
elections will take heed of this call.

My input will be from a provincial perspective, and I would like to
commence by commending the Government on realising the conservation and
tourism dream by signing the formalities for establishing the Gaza, Kruger
and Gonarezhou Parks as a trans-frontier Park between South Africa,
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

This park will consist of national parks, private game reserves, hunting
concession areas and community-managed natural resource areas. The elation
of the South African Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Mr
Valli Moosa, is shared by all South Africans, as the proposed new park,
embracing three contiguous countries, would be a tremendous boost to the
tourism industry and a further assault on poverty and unemployment.

A matter of deep concern to us in KwaZulu-Natal is the continued evidence
of gross irregularities within the bosom of the SAPS, alleged police links
with hijack syndicates, cash-in-transit robberies and misdemeanours such as
rape and sexual offences which continue to be reported ad nauseam in the
media, radio and TV. This wave of lawlessness within the law cannot be
considered as the exception any longer.

I quote the case of one Durban policeman, who still has his job, and was
indicted on five counts of statutory rape and one of indecent assault
involving a 14-year-old. The man has reportedly admitted to the offences,
but his superiors, in their own perverted fashion, say his actions do not
warrant suspension.

Captain Vish Naidoo, the police spokesman, has apparently passed his own
judgment, suggesting that the man and the little girl were lovers. This
spokesman is ignorant of the law, which is to protect minors from abuse.
This stupid response from such an ignoramus surely warrants his own
suspension! Such a lackadaisical attitude to misdemeanours perpetrated by
police officers cannot be tolerated.

Just as in medieval times, we had modern minds, in modern times we have
barbaric minds. Can we doubt, after watching the dog squad videos that
shattered our lives so rudely last week, that pockets of backward elements
that exult in the worst acts of barbarism, still remain within our
civilised society?

In the field of education, the national Ministry has passed some good laws
recently, but there are things going on on the ground that is putting a
stain on the copybook. Some school principals do not seem to comprehend the
imperatives of the Constitution, that is, every child has a right to
education, whatever the background.

We have cases where school principals are barring those children whose
parents have not paid the school fees from entering the school premises or
writing their final examinations. School report cards are even withheld by
these principals, who are clearly indulging in unprocedural and
unconstitutional measures.

Finally, the role of the media in a democracy has recently been assailed
from many quarters. In my province, KwaZulu-Natal, when the media reported
on some aspects of ministerial spending on houses, travel, and security,
the spectre of a ``media cabal'' was raised, suggesting that this cabal had
a sinister agenda to undermine the governing coalition.

But, surely it is normal for the media, in a democracy such as ours, to
call to account any conduct by government Ministers or officials who might
be seen to be contributing to the country's economic woes. After all,
William Shakespeare said:


  The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
  But in ourselves, that we are underlings.

Venality and venery have been part of the accoutrements of men holding
public office since medieval times, but historical evidence of such
characteristics surrounding public figures is not enough to exculpate those
among us who might evince a penchant to practise such misdemeanours.

The hon Deputy President has correctly alluded to the importance of
adherence to morality and ethics in our society. Our lives must be like a
spiralling staircase, with a relentless striving towards higher levels of
moral conduct, each day in our own spheres of activity.

I would like to conclude with the words of Tennyson's Ulysses. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P C McKENZIE (Western Cape): Chairperson, Deputy President, it is an
honour to follow after the hon member. It is just strange that they are
basically in the same alliance and yet what he says is the direct opposite
of what Mrs Gouws is saying. So it would be my suggestion that their Whips
get together and check their speeches beforehand so that they make speeches
out of one mouth. [Laughter.]

However, I do want to say that I was very glad when I heard the speech that
my friend Mr Marais made. Then in my heart I immediately changed my
official speech and I began to write a new speech whilst sitting here.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Very good, very good.

Mr P C McKENZIE: So I am covering my official speech. I want to say that it
was so strange and that I felt so good in my heart that I no longer belong
to the party that blames and complains and does not give any solutions to
the South African situation. [Applause.] It was absolutely a nice sense of
freedom to know that I now belong to the party that does not blame and
complain, but in which we roll up our sleeves and get into the work and try
to solve the situation in this country.

What also came up badly for him is the fact that he was trying to defend
something that could not be defended. If members remember ...
[Interjections.] Now Mr Ackermann will keep his mouth shut, because he must
hear what I want to say. If he does not know this Mr Meyer, Mr Marais will
know him. In the late 1960s, Mr Marais and another MEC, Piet Meyer, and I
entered politics at exactly the same time. [Interjections.] In fact, I
became the chairman of the Labour Party in Bonteheuwel. At the same time,
Mr Marais became the chairman of the Nooitgedacht branch and Piet Meyer
became the chairman of the Bishop Lavis branch.

Together we fought against injustice in this country. [Interjections.]
Together we said to ourselves that it was immoral to see people of colour,
people who were not white in this country, having to leave their homes. In
my family, twice we were forcibly removed out of District Six and Mowbray
because of the apartheid system. Now I find my friend coming here and
defending a system that was corrupt. [Interjections.] Let me go further.
This is what is heartbreaking, because together we were the three radicals
who fought for change. Today the hon member talks about posts. Is that all
that people of his calibre think of, posts and positions. We say to our
friend that we are not in politics for post and positions; we are in
politics to serve the needs of the community. [Interjections.]

To the member who is making such a lot of noise, I would like to say that
when we were negotiating about joining the NP, he was not part of those
negotiations, because he was too far down. But during those negotiations,
there was only one reason why we then broke away from the Labour Party. We
said: Let us try to get the sun to fall on all South Africans, because the
sun should not shine only on white South Africans, and the day has arrived
when we can speak out and not be treated like stepchildren in this country.
Mr Marais was part of that decision. [Interjections.] That is why it breaks
my heart that he is being used - and Hansard will prove what I am saying
here today - because we did not join the NP because of its policies. No
one, of any colour, would have joined the NP because of its apartheid
policies. So we said: Let us try to use this vehicle to see if liberation
cannot come to this country sooner.

Right now, if we look at the polls and the elections that are going to be
run in this province, and especially here where liberation and
transformation have not taken place yet ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Not in this province.

Mr P C MCKENZIE: So we asked those things, and it is true what the hon
Chief Whip said.

When there were negotiations between the DP and the NP, the big thing was
to get the coloured vote. Of the delegation that went to these
negotiations, there were only two coloureds there representing our people.
[Interjections.] But they spoke about the future of coloureds in this
community. [Interjections.]

Now let me go further ... [Time expired.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order, hon members! I
will not allow the next member to speak before there is order in the House.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, when I was much younger and still at
school, I read and I was taught about the total onslaught, and the total
onslaught was eradicated by time. Today, again, we are experiencing a total
onslaught on a champion who is going to get rid of that onslaught too.
[Interjections.]

Dit is interessant dat hier vandag gelag is toe mnr McKenzie gepraat het;
nie vir wát hy gesê het nie, maar vir hom persoonlik. Dit is tog
interessant wanneer mense oorloop na 'n ander party toe. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is interesting to note that we had laughter here today when Mr McKenzie
spoke; not for what he said but for him personally. It is indeed an
interesting phenomenon when people cross the floor.]

They have to show that they are more ANC than the ANC itself.
[Interjections.] I find it very interesting that when somebody talks on
behalf of a party or a province, as we have experienced here today, the
largest portion of their speech is directed at one individual in that
specific audience. [Interjections.] [Laughter.] Any junior psychoanalyst
would be able to tell one that they do that because they have been hurt by
the truths spoken by that person and that they are doubting what they stand
for. [Interjections.]

To Mr Surty - in his absence, as he has most probably gone for therapy -
and Mr McKenzie we say: ``We understand. You can relax now.''
[Interjections.] To Mr Mayor Marais we say: ``We congratulate you. You have
done it again.''

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member, on
what point are you rising?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Yes, raise it.

Mr T B TAABE: I just want to establish whether it is in order for this
unintelligent and often myopic old man to ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Order, hon
member! [Laughter.] Could you get to your point of order?

Mr T B TAABE: Yes, for him to be, every time he opens his mouth ...
[Inaudible.] [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): That is not a point
of order.
Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, on a point of order: That hon member has now
made allegations against this colleague of ours in the Council.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order, Mr Ackermann!
[Interjections.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: I cannot hear you. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Hon members, you are
making a noise. We cannot hear the speakers.

Mr Ackermann, I ruled the member out of order. What else do you want?

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, even if you ruled him out of order, I still
want you to take that allegation into account, and this hon member should
be out of the Council. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,
you are out of order. You have no right to impose any judgment on any other
member.
Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek het 'n maand gelede in hierdie
Parlement saam met 'n Duitse sakeman geëet. Hy het ses jaar gelede na Suid-
Afrika toe gekom en die besturende direkteur van 'n groot maatskappy
geword. 'n Jaar gelede het hy hier in Suid-Afrika afgetree.

Ek het vir hom gesê dit is vir my vreemd, en gevra hoekom hy in Suid-Afrika
aftree, want waarom sal 'n wêreldburger in Suid-Afrika aftree waar ons
ekonomiese groeikoers laer is as ons beloofde mikpunt en die rand so swak
vertoon? Waarom sal hy aftree in 'n land waar misdaad nie onder bedwang
gebring kan word nie, waar vroue en kinders uurliks verkrag word, waar
landbouers se vrouens en kinders vermoor word?

Waarom sal hy wil aftree in 'n land waarvan die president die MIV/vigs- en
grondbesettingskwessies so lomp hanteer? Waarom sal hy in 'n land wil
aftree waar die onderwysdepartement donateursfondse van R960 miljoen nie
kan bestee nie, terwyl onderwys en opleiding 'n prioriteit is? Waarom sal
hy wil aftree in 'n land waar die welsyntoelae ingekort word terwyl die
departement geld moet oorrol wat nie vir die armstes van die armes
aangewend is nie? [Tussenwerpsels.]
Waarom sal hy in 'n land wil aftree waar daar gerugte is van korrupsie
waarby 'n R43 miljard-wapenkontrak betrokke is en waarin mense in hoë
posisies geïmpliseer word? Waarom sal hy wil aftree in 'n land waar die
mineraleregte van swartmense wat in trust gehou word, genasionaliseer word?
Waarom sal hy wil aftree in 'n land waar rassisme nog 'n werklikheid is en
selfs misbruik word om politieke punte aan te teken, en selfs as
regverdiging dien vir kriminele dade? [Tussenwerpsels.]

Waarom sal hy in 'n land wil aftree waar 'n beter lewe vir almal belowe
word terwyl hoofsaaklik vriende, familie en kamerade of hulle met 'n sekere
partylidmaatskapkaart alleen die voordeel trek? Waarom sal hy in 'n land
wil aftree waar werkgeleenthede minder gemaak word en nie geskep word nie?
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, a month ago I had a meal with a German
businessman at this Parliament. Six years ago he immigrated to South Africa
and became the managing director of a huge company. A year ago he retired
here in South Africa.

I told him that this was strange to me and asked him why he had retired in
South Africa, because it begs the question why a citizen of the world would
retire in South Africa where our economic growth is lower than our promised
aim and the rand is showing so poorly. Why would he retire in a country
where crime cannot be kept under control, where women and children are
raped hourly, where the women and children of agriculturists are murdered?

Why would he want to retire in a country whose President is dealing so
clumsily with the HIV-Aids issue as well as the land occupation issue? Why
would he want to retire in a country where the education department cannot
spend donors funds of R960 million while education and training is a
priority? Why would he want to retire in a country where the welfare grant
has been cut back, while the department has to roll over funds which have
not been used for the poorest of the poor? [Interjections.]

Why would he want to retire in a country where there are rumours of
corruption involving a R43 billion arms contract, and in which people in
high positions are being implicated? Why would he want to retire in a
country where the mineral rights of black people which are kept in trust
are being nationalised? Why would he want to retire in a country where
racism is still a reality and even misused to score political points, and
moreover even serves as justification for criminal deeds? [Interjections.]

Why would he want to retire in a country where a better life for all is
promised while mainly friends, family and comrades or those with a certain
party membership card are drawing the privileges? Why would he want to
retire in a country where job opportunities are being reduced and are not
being created?]

Why would anybody wish to settle in a country like this if he can go
anywhere in the world? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Could you take
your seat, hon member.

Mr M V MOOSA: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I would like to know
from the hon member where he got all that information from, because he is
misleading the House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That is not a
point of order. Continue, hon member.
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I will excuse the hon member's ignorance, Sir.

Why would anybody wish to settle in a country like this while he can settle
anywhere in the world?

This gentleman from Germany gave me hope, and I want to share that with hon
members. He said that South Africa offers him and his family the
opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives like nowhere else
in the world. I want to repeat that. He said he settled here because in
South Africa he and his family could make a difference in people's lives
like nowhere else in the developed world. [Interjections.]

That is the reason why that hon member, and all of us in this House are
here, exactly for that, and for nothing else. As Leo Buscaglia said: The
purpose of life is to help others, and if you can't, help them, don't hurt
them.

Hierdie Nasionale Raad van Provinsies is die naelstring tussen ons mense op
grondvlak en die nasionale Regering, en sy plek in die demokrasie is
onmisbaar. As dit egter nie deur sy eie lede, die premiers en die LUR'e in
die provinsies en deur die uitvoerende gesag van die land erken word en
gerespekteer word nie, is die kanse vir hom om te slaag net mooi nul.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This National Council of Provinces is the umbilical cord between our
people at grass-roots level and national Government, and its place in the
democracy is vital. However, if it is not recognised and respected by its
own members, the premiers and the MECs in the provinces and by the
executive authority, then chance for success is precisely zero.]

Although I cannot identify with the black, white and green colours, nor
with the ANC logo on their local election posters, I can identify with the
slogan: Together we can speed up change and fight poverty! [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: By joining us!

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Together we can do it if we recognise basic needs, and
I only have time to emphasise one - one that is my passion,
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Join us! Join us!

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: That passion of mine is the right of all the people in
South Africa to use the languages of our forefathers, and to be served in
those languages.

I want to challenge the Deputy President, the ANC and all the other parties
in this House today to make the following a crucial point of their election
campaign. We are surely going to do it. I want to quote what we are going
to tell the people:

Die DA-beheerde munisipaliteite sal verstaanbare inligting voorsien aan al
sy mense; nie ongevoelig of lukraak met inwoners se taalregte omgaan of dit
ignoreer nie; die taalbepalings van die Grondwet uitvoer deur 'n opname van
al die mense se taalvoorkeure in rade onder sy beheer te doen; 'n
bemagtigende taalbeleid op grond van die opname saamstel, dit billik toepas
en gereeld hersien om inwoners doeltreffend in die hooftale van daardie
rade te kan bedien; gebruikersvriendelik in die rade se taalkeuses
kommunikeer om aansoeke, vertoë, klagtes, inligting en interne sake
deurgaans in die rade se keuse-tale te hanteer. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)
[The DA-controlled municipalities will provide intelligible information to
all their people; not be insensitive to, or haphazardly deal with, the
language rights of citizens or ignore those rights; execute the language
provisions of the Constitution by doing a survey of all the language
preferences of people in councils under its control; compile an empowering
language policy on the basis of the survey, apply it fairly and revise it
regularly to be able to serve citizens effectively in the main languages of
those councils; communicate in a user-friendly manner in the language
choices of the councils to deal with applications, protests, complaints,
information and internal matters in the councils' languages of their
choice.]

Up to now we have had a top-down approach, and this approach, for bringing
multilingualism about as functional reality, did not work.

Only six of the 27 ministers gave some input to the Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology to be incorporated in the draft Bill. It is
time for a bottom-up approach. Let us take up the challenge and empower our
people through the languages they know best. It is time that we used our
diversity as our strength and not as a divisive factor.

Let us host a national language and culture conference in order to really
build the bridges so as to form one powerful rainbow nation. Let us not
postpone it, for life is not a rehearsal. We are busy with the final act.
The time to make a difference is now.

Let the ANC poster become a reality. [Interjections.] ...

An HON MEMBER: Come and join us!

An HON MEMBER: Come and join the ANC!

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Let the ANC poster become a reality, and not just an
empty promise on paper worth nothing, like this piece of paper that I am
crumpling in my hand. [Time expired.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, section 27(1) and (2) of the Constitution
places an obligation on both the National Assembly and the NCOP to ensure
that the state takes reasonable legislative and other measures within its
available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the citizen's
right to have access to sufficient food and water, health care services,
including reproductive health care, and social security support for those
who cannot care for themselves.

The Northern Province has long been held up by socioeconomic backlogs.
Approximately half a million of the people, particularly those in the
economically viable age group, are unemployed in the area. To close this
gap we would have to employ thousands of people per month. The province has
to grapple with a backlog of over 40 000 classrooms, an excessive matric
failure rate and illiteracy rates and a shortage of teachers with science
skills. To be honest, these backlogs were in existence long before our
democratic Government came into being. I am saying this because I live in
that area.

The 1998 flood disaster that destroyed the largest portion of our road
network infrastructure added to the then backlog of 4  000 km of new roads
to be paved at a cost of R1,5 billion, as well as the rehabilitation of
other economic roads and so on.

Backlogs are once more being encountered with regard to access to safe and
potable water by the rural household clinics, health centres and even
hospitals. I have received reports from some of the rural clinics and
health centres during constituency weeks that they sometimes run nursing
services for a week without water. Yet dams such as Middle Letaba, Sami,
Tzaneen and Ebenezer are full to capacity. These dams are located within
the areas where complaints emerge.

Given this background, we should ask ourselves whether we have ever
sincerely discharged our legislative responsibilities in terms of the
expectations of section 27(1) and (2) of the Constitution. If yes, well and
good, and if not, collectively we have to reconsider our positions in this
Parliament.

I would like to commend the Department of Provincial and Local Government
for the manner in which they allocated funds to the individual
municipalities for the financial year 2001-02. After careful scrutiny of
the allocations, there will be no reason for the municipal councils to fail
to deliver essential services to the communities.

I call upon all political parties at local government level to join forces
in terms of their expert knowledge, past experience and otherwise, because
water, roads, electricity and refuse removal facilities are communally
consumed, irrespective of party-political passions.

Lastly, the HIV/Aids issue is simple and straightforward to an ordinary man
like me. Like any other disease, early diagnosis and treatment, be it
prophylactic or curative, is the basic emphasis. Condomise, abstain or
stick to one partner at a time - these are preventative measures. HIV/Aids
is a contentious and controversial disease in the eyes of politicians. Like
with any other human disease, the affected person's health and capacity
become undermined.

Any disease that assumes pandemic proportions impacts negatively on the
economy of the country. HIV/Aids will undoubtedly have effects on a range
of economic aggregates, including gross domestic product, poverty, labour
supply and productivity.

With these few arguments, Chairperson, I would like to thank you and the
House. [Applause.]

Dr Z L MKHIZE (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, I want to thank this House for
the opportunity to address hon members. May I also thank the Deputy
President for his outstanding address, which has given us direction and
confidence.

The matter which we would wish to bring to the attention of this Council is
the problem of the outbreak of cholera in KwaZulu-Natal since the middle of
August. Since then about 4 822 people have been treated for the infection,
but our daily admissions are showing figures below 50 in the whole
province, which is a tremendous reduction. We would therefore want to
assure members that cholera is under control.

The districts which are affected are Mfolozi, Eshowe, Nkandla, Jozini,
Durban and Port Shepstone. About half of the deaths that have been recorded
occurred within the first three weeks, but energetic intervention by the
different teams has kept the death toll as low as 33.

I therefore wish to commend the officials from the Departments of Health
and Water Affairs, the Defence Force, local government and local
authorities for the enthusiastic manner in which they moved to give health
education, distribute chlorine solution and set up water tanks, which has
led to the containment of the infection. Co-operation from traditional and
community leaders, school teachers, the Red Cross and other NGOs was also
quite outstanding. I also wish to commend the private sector companies
which made contributions to the fight against cholera.

Though the initial problem was water contamination, it is clear, from the
tests done showing that some of the rivers and boreholes are clear, that
the problem is now communicable through human contact. We believe that the
provision of water to 6 million people in this country is an achievement
and that the Government's commitment to providing essential services to our
people is the way to guarantee a better life for all and would also save us
from the problem of waterborne infections.

We reiterate that the epidemic is under control and that it poses no danger
whatsoever to tourists. KwaZulu-Natal is therefore a safe place. Cholera is
only confined to villages where there is poor water supply and sanitation.

We want to support the call from the Deputy President for moral
regeneration. The co-operation in our province between the ANC and the IFP
has made an impact on the establishment of peace and tranquillity in
KwaZulu-Natal. We believe that peace will pave the way for social
development and the reconstruction of the community's life and soul. It is
under these conditions of peace that economic growth and the eradication of
poverty can be achieved.

The tragedies that occurred in Ntshanga and Cato Ridge, where about seven
people were murdered in the past two days, are sparks of community
conflicts which have already been solved. We believe that our vigilance
will assist in reducing these kinds of incidences, but as we send our
condolences to the bereaved we also believe that despite such events our
elections will be peaceful and will be without any significance
disturbances.

We also wish to commend the Office of the Presidency for the manner in
which they have dealt with the problem of traditional leaders to ensure
that traditional and elected leadership co-operate and co-exist peacefully
for the benefit of the communities.

Our concern about the rapid spread of HIV/Aids is matched by our vigorous
campaign in mobilising the community and leadership to encourage a change
in behaviour, using life-skills training for the youth in and out of
schools and mobilising volunteers for home-based care amongst the religious
leaders and different leaders, healers, NGOs, artists, musicians, and so
on. This co-operation on our programmes of training more community leaders
on the issues of HIV/Aids has been outstanding. We have also distributed
condoms at a rate which, at this stage, amounts to about 3,5 million per
month, and we have established a pilot project which is using shebeens and
taverns for the distribution of condoms.

We are under no illusion that fighting poverty, strengthening access to
health services and eliminating illiteracy will be part of our armament.
The prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV will be strengthened
by expansions to a number of hospital sites, such as King Edward, Prince
Mshiyeni, Edendale, Grey's and Northdale, and other clinics. In fact, all
provinces have identified sites where these projects will be taking place.
This has been a national decision which means that, in the next few weeks,
we will be using Nevirapine for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV
transmission at a number of sites in the different provinces.

We believe, therefore, that the campaign by the Democratic Alliance for
free drugs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV is
completely irrelevant. We also condemn the use of HIV/Aids and the genuine
fears of HIV-positive people for electioneering. We believe it is too
serious an issue to be used for vote catching, because it is targeted at
creating false expectations and an impression that the Government does not
care about the lives of people.

We also believe that the approach by Mr Leon to negotiate for free drugs
was also quite opportunistic, because I do not believe that there are
pharmaceutical companies that would wish to sideline a trading partner,
that is, the Government, and make a deal with the opposition leader who has
no executive power. The Department of Foreign Affairs was fortunately able
to get out of this mess. We want to know what Mr Leon has done, personally.

I am also puzzled by the comments and questions that have been raised by Mr
Van Niekerk. I do not believe a South African can raise so many questions
and want to know why he should remain a South African and yet proudly say
that he has been convinced by a foreigner, a German, that South Africa is
still a good place to be. I personally believe that this kind of identity
crisis of the DA is actually the cause of their problems in trying to
convince voters that the past is possible in the future. We therefore say
that because of their confrontational, divisive and negative attitude and
approach, we do not believe that they are a party that should rule this
country. We want to assure our people that they will remain safe, because
they can never be left in the hands of a party such as the DA.

Therefore, regarding the concerns we have raised in relation to their
approach to HIV/Aids issues, we all need to be united in our fight against
HIV/Aids and we should not use this very serious tragedy for partisan and
political-party interests. Rather, we should actually unite on common
programmes in which we, with the Government and different opposition
parties, are taking a step forward in ensuring that our people can be more
alert to the problems of HIV/Aids. With those words, I want to thank
members very much for this opportunity. [Applause.]

Ms N MFEKETO (Salga): Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon members,
before coming here this afternoon, I hosted a lunch for about 200 old age
pensioners, most of whom were over 75 years of age. They had earlier
visited this Parliament and then went to have lunch at the council. It was
the first time in their lives that they visited both Parliament and the
council.

When I told them that the Deputy President was going to be here, they asked
me to convey a message to him. They said that they knew that yesterday's
parties, that call themselves `new' today, would be saying they are
speaking on their behalf, on behalf of the poor people, but for them the
fact that they are citizens of this country, the fact that they are human
beings protected by the Constitution of this country, is something they
never dreamed of, and even though they want us to speed up transformation
and change, that alone is transformation in this country.

It is true that as we march towards achieving our goal of reconciliation,
reconstruction and development we are still faced with obstacles and forces
against change in our society.

The past week's Special Assignment programme on television has posed a real
challenge, and a major question, to the nation and international
communities, both friends and foes of our country. We should begin to ask
ourselves important questions, as a nation, namely, whether we are able to
deal with the problems of racism and brutality, and whether we really are a
nation that lives in two different worlds. One world is a world of change
which calls for reconciliation, reconstruction and development of our
society, instilling moral fibre in our people, and the other is a world
that is characterised by hatred and a lack of racial tolerance that has
been inflicted on people by the past system of apartheid, a society that
wants to maintain draconian behaviour within our society.

In dealing with these problems we should be able, as a country, to
acknowledge the fact that our society is still trapped by a deep-seated
racial problem. There is a need for change in the mindsets of our people.
We have to join forces against racial problems and intolerance, and be able
to heed the call that we are a nation at change. The time has come to do
all we can to seek, beyond the political differences, a common ground as a
basis for national action.
On 7 November 2000 Salga, in partnership with the national Health Ministry
and the United Nations Development Programme, launched a chapter on the
alliance of mayors and municipal leaders on HIV/Aids in Africa. The signing
of a declaration committed South Africa to endorsing the Abuja Declaration
of 1998. The declaration called upon local government to implement
effective measures to reduce the socioeconomic impact of HIV/Aids, to
promote and co-ordinate a multisectoral approach to HIV prevention, to
mobilise both human and financial resources, to implement local strategies
on HIV/Aids, and to ensure active involvement of infected and affected
people by HIV/Aids.

This commitment by our mayors and the Minister of Health is in line with
our fourth annual general meeting resolution and the signing of a
declaration on HIV/Aids by the Salga leadership and the Minister for
Provincial and Local Government. Our call on HIV/Aids, as organised local
government, is within the context that local government, as a sphere of
government that is closer to the people, should ensure that HIV/Aids forms
part of service delivery, including that of health services.

The national HIV/Aids and STD strategic plan for South Africa should be
implemented at the local government level, in partnership with community-
based organisations and organs of civil society, with a special focus on
young people. Funding for HIV/Aids should be channelled to local government
to capacitate our municipalities to render a primary health care service.

The programme to combat the pandemic should take place in the context of
our fight against poverty to make basic health services, clean water and
sanitation accessible to all our people.

Our former President, Dr N Mandela, made a call for nation-building, a call
to all our communities across the political, religious and racial spectrum
to play a key role in the reconstruction and development of our country. We
have adopted the Reconstruction and Development Programme as a soul for
development. Hence, today, as local government, we continue to strive for
the provision of services to those communities which were previously
deprived of these services. We will ensure that we meet our constitutional
responsibility by meeting the needs of our people and, together, speed up
change. [Applause.]
Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, when the present Government came to power in
1994, with the mandate from the electorate to effectuate its slogan of ``a
better life for all'', ordinary citizens of this country held a belief that
the end of their suffering was nigh. For, prior to the elections, the
country had been at the nadir of its fortunes one day too long.

In the field of telecommunications, a vexing paradox was experienced, as 94
out of every 100 white people had access to a telephone, and 87 out of 100
white households had telephones installed in their homes, whilst 53 out of
every 100 black people had access to a telephone, and only 12 out of every
100 black households had telephones. All this was evident in 1994.

It should be noted that the RDP recognised access to telephones not only as
a basic need, but also as a prerequisite for social development for all.
That is why, in 1996, Telkom was given roll-out targets for telephones as a
condition tied to its licence obligation. It was further granted a five-
year exclusivity in certain telecommunication services in order to meet the
RDP objectives set by the Government.
Between 1996 and today, over 1,3 million new access lines have been
installed. A total of 427 338 lines were installed in traditionally
underserviced areas, whilst 4 339 lines were installed in schools, mainly
in rural areas. Six hundred and fifty-seven villages obtained telephone
access from these projects. In fact, I am informed that telephone access,
with the inclusion of cellular phones, has reached an astronomical figure
of 13 million in South Africa.

At the same time, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are still only 15 telephones
for every 1000 persons, whilst New York is said to have more telephones
than the rest of Africa. This truism reminds me of the words of wisdom from
Nelson Mandela's autobiography when he said:


  I have walked that long road to freedom. I have taken a moment here to
  rest, but I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes
  responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet
  ended.

Symbolically, this means that for us to be truly free, the co-operation of
all of us is imperative.

We should remember that for everything there is a season. There is a season
to criticise, a season to destroy or to watch something that one cannot
sustain die. There is also a season to love and build, and so on and so
forth. The NCOP finds itself at a vantage point to co-ordinate, co-operate,
ameliorate relations, and to advance the interests of our country and her
people, as the Deputy President has just indicated.

On the African Renaissance question, when the present Government came to
power, public opinion, both inside and outside of this country indicated
that South Africa was then poised to play a pivotal role, not only in the
economic revival of sub-Saharan Africa and later the rest of Africa, but in
an attempt to unify Africa.

To this end, Eskom has penetrated the African energy market with vehement
vigour. Today, if one travels from Cape Town to the village called Zama
Zama in Tunisia, then to Senegal and to Somalia, one will find that Eskom
supplies two thirds of Africa's electricity. Telkom has telephone links
with all 53 countries in Africa. All these are attempts to realise the
African Renaissance vision. Vodacom and MTN have made significant inroads
into the African market, in pursuance of the African Renaissance vision.

The President of this country, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, has aptly indicated in
his book and in his speeches that Africa's revival is beckoning and that
this is the time for it. True to form, if one looks around, one will see,
more especially towards sunset, a huge stone resembling the moon perched
majestically on the edge of the horizon, with the inscription: ``Africa,
this is your millennium. You have contributed so much to the world. Now it
is the time for you to contribute to yourself.''

However, not everyone sees from looking. Many look, but only a few see. I
do not believe Mr Marais - it is a pity he is not here - sees. It is
outrageously dishonest of him to say that 480 jobs are lost each day
without juxtaposing that questionable statistic against jobs that are
created in this country. Rather, one should talk of net job losses, of net
jobs created. I am aware that the hon Marais is too dim-witted to
understand that for every action there is a reaction. That is what physics
teaches us. I doubt whether he has studied elementary economics. I do not
think he would understand.
An HON MEMBER: He does not know about that.

Mr S L E FENYANE: Mr Marais does not seem to understand the origin and
advantages of the formations of regional economic communities, known as
trade blocs. Countries negotiate better international trade links if they
do that collectively. Mr Marais's outburst of guff did not cater for this.
I am not surprised, though. He has been overtaken by prejudice, ignorance
and a want of common sense.

In the field of human resource development, studies in international
management have revealed that countries that do not respect education will
always find themselves at the peripheries of globalisation.

If one went to Japan today, one would discover that Japan manufactures
arguably the world's most comfortable sedan, called the Lexus. Each day,
300 Lexus sedans are produced by 66 persons and 310 robots. Japan also has
a modern train that travels at a speed of 180 miles per hour. Japan
arguably leads the world in the field of technological innovativeness. What
is its secret? Education and commitment! [Time expired.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chairperson, His Excellency the Deputy President, hon
premiers and MECs, and hon members, on behalf of the UCDP I also wish to
congratulate His Excellency the Deputy President, who, in spite of his
tight schedule and other pressures of work, has found time to visit this
House. We are indebted to the Deputy President, particularly with regard to
the pertinent issues that he raised this afternoon. We support the
principle of working co-operatively and harmoniously with other political
parties, something he has appealed for. We shall not be party to any form
of destabilisation of the ensuing elections.

We are committed to genuine efforts to bring about peace and stability in
the forthcoming local government elections. However, we remain a party with
a mind of its own. We reserve the right to differ with any other political
party where it is necessary to differ. We reserve the right to caution our
constituencies and support bases to say no to any rhetoric, fancy talk or
empty promises by any political party. [Interjections.]

The HIV/Aids scourge is ravaging our people like a wild fire. Statistical
indications are that it will leave old people such as myself without their
young to look after them. It will cripple the economy and cause a
devastation worse than the ravages of war. Whilst we support the prevention
strategies propounded, we would also urge that proper drugs be procured.
However, in the absence of appropriate medication to stop mother-to-child
transmission, a second best could be better than nothing all. The longer we
take to procure the appropriate drugs, the more advantage we lend to the
``bo raitsi'', which means unqualified traditional healers. We wish to make
an earnest appeal to Government to act swiftly and decisively in the search
for appropriate drugs to contain this scourge.

The Deputy President's message, with regard to some measure of
understanding reached with the traditional leaders, is comforting and sets
us at ease. This piece of information augurs well for the forthcoming
elections. [Applause.]

Mr S H GQOBANA (Eastern Cape): Chairperson, Deputy President, I want to
take this opportunity to participate in this important debate as outlined
by our Deputy President. I first want to apologise for the absence of our
premier who had a very hectic programme the previous week and, as a result,
is very busy at the moment.

I think it is very important to participate in the debate after it has been
outlined by our Deputy President and a line of march given to all South
Africans. I wish to state that there should be no doubt in the minds of all
South Africans precisely because the challenges that the Deputy President
has outlined are challenges that have already been confronted and raised.
Even those who doubted them when they were initially raised are now
confirming their reality, and are offering their participation in dealing
with those challenges. Some of those challenges relate to the issue of
brutal violence and racism.

I will not repeat what the other speakers have raised with respect to
various conferences that have been convened around the question of racism,
but I want to share a few experiences relating to what happens in the
Eastern Cape in relation to brutal violence. Perhaps the reason why some of
these incidents are not covered on TV is because of the remoteness of the
province from which we come.

I think one major incident took place some time ago in Barkly East, where
members of the SAPS arrested some juveniles suspected of housebreaking.
These boys were assaulted and later their clothes were removed from their
bodies. They were requested to get into a dam with their heads submerged in
the water. When one of them tried to raise his head out of the water, a
firearm was pointed at him. This was done to extract information from them.

Two boys were later tied with ropes and were required to run on the other
side of the SAPS vehicle. When one of the ropes broke, an SAPS member held
the deceased by his arms whilst he was still running alongside the van. At
some stage both boys fell and the vehicle drove over one boy's head,
killing him instantly.

This House is also aware of the incident that took place in the Uitenhage
area, in Burgersdorp, where an SAPS member shot at his wife and then
travelled to Uitenhage to kill his children and girlfriend, later turning
the gun on himself. These are some of the few incidents that we have
encountered. How many more of the same nature are there that we do not know
about?

With respect to moral renewal, moral decay is caused by the degeneration of
a value system informed by the social values originating from the
socialisation process. For example, rape, robbery, murder, fraud and
domestic violence are not the kind of behaviour that can be condoned in any
civilised community or culture.

This should become our common point of departure. Our history, as the hon
the Deputy President has outlined, is one of oppression, of racial
discrimination and dehumanisation, of poverty, of institutionalised
violence and counterviolence, of the breakdown of family life through
mobility control laws and violence and, more importantly, of the decision
of the youth to take the responsibility for liberating our country upon
themselves.

We believe that our transition to democracy, which has so far been
miraculously successful, will be wrecked unless leaders of every sector of
society combine forces to combat the alarming deterioration in public
morality. It is for this reason that a democracy such as ours, which has
emerged from the apartheid ashes, should be founded on sound moral values
that will inculcate in each of us a sense of national pride, oneness and
commitment to the common good.

Unless we actively embrace the good and the positive and inculcate it in
our children and their offspring, these evils that are characteristic of
our past will always be part of our society. All institutions, that is,
schools, family units, Government, and society in general, should strive
for the development of the new value system through education and through
Government policies.

The moral renewal is not a new agenda, but an inseparable continuation of
the liberation struggle. Therefore, no single group or section of our
society can appoint itself the guardian of the nation's morals. We all have
a role to play.

Regarding the impact of HIV in the Eastern Cape, we wish to share the
following points with this House: From the sexually active population,
which is 18% of the total Eastern Cape population or 500 000, in region A -
that is the Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage Metropole - 22,1% have HIV; in region
B, the Queenstown area, 15,1%; in region C, the Mdantsane area, 17,1%; in
region D, the Umtata area, 17,5% and, in region E, the Bizana and Umzimkulu
area, the percentage is 22%.

HIV poses a challenge to sustainable development. The rate of infection
affects socioeconomic development negatively. A large portion of household
income is spent on health care for adults and children who are ill because
they are HIV-positive, have Aids, or have Aids-related diseases. The
household capacity to sustain itself is significantly reduced as the
members infected become economically inept. Many African families are
stretched to the limit, as they have to accommodate children whose parents
have died of Aids.

HIV/Aids poses a threat to investment in the Eastern Cape and the rest of
the country. Companies from abroad are sceptical of investing in a country
where social responsibility exceeds the return on investment. As is the
case now, since HIV/Aids affects mostly the economically active population
group, this means a large amount of money will be used on the training and
replacement of personnel. Above all, the rate of absenteeism is due to sick
leave.

Of particular concern is the strain that it is going to exert on our
limited health budget. The economic situation in our province had led to
80% of the people depending on the public health sector, meaning that the
management of HIV/Aids in the province will deplete the health budget. The
health budget is also affected in the sense that a large percentage of HIV-
infected people are prone to opportunistic diseases such as TB. In the past
few months, there has been a significant increase in the number of people
admitted who have been affected by opportunistic diseases. Most of them are
admitted to hospitals and stay, in some cases, longer than 30 days.

Most of the people who die of Aids-related diseases are those between the
ages of 25 and 35, which is the youth. The catastrophe is the loss of a
possible generation, since this is the economically active group which is
supposed to be contributing towards the economic development of our
country, and of our province, in particular. One of the indicators of a
declining participation in the economic development is the amount of sick
leave requested by those who are working. The fight against Aids calls upon
all of us to act in unity.

The other point that we want to share with the hon the Deputy President is
that we should seriously consider the devastating effects that the
situation imposes upon our youth, economy, communities, provinces, and our
country at large. The provincial HIV/Aids unit of the department of health
decided, planned and acted in a holistic fashion to increase access to
testing, voluntary counselling, promotion of youth education programmes,
continued HIV/Aids education, prevention of mother-to-child transmission,
ensuring HIV/TB integrated interventions, strengthening community-based
care, research, monitoring and evaluation, social mobilisation, and
resource training centres. This is done in conjunction with the premier's
office.

In addition to the steps outlined above, condoms are requested directly
from the national Department of Health by districts, and are then supplied
according to the various needs of the districts.

In conclusion, I want to make a clarion call in support of the Deputy
President to the young and old, black and white, rural and urban who belong
to various denominations and political affiliations, to seriously consider
the consequences of their decisions. We only have one option and that is to
collectively declare war against HIV, and request females, as they have
made history, to make sure that they continue to make history with HIV by
helping us to change our attitudes and behaviours.

If there are any minutes left I would like to share with members the
situation of the hospital that was once projected on the TV news, with
special reference to Middelburg. I think that members have seen, on TV,
nurses collecting money and all those things. That was done despite a lot
of money having been saved by the hospital board. They have claimed that
there is no money and, as such, they were trying to assist patients, yet
the picture is as follows: There is an amount of R36 000 which is being
kept there, and there are general funds amounting to R15 000 which are also
kept there, by the hospital. In the cheque account, the following figures
are reflected as established by the hospital board. In Absa Bank there is
R11 000. In another account in Absa Bank there is R7 000. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr A MARAIS: Chairperson, hon Deputy President and hon colleagues, at the
outset I would like to apologise on behalf of our premier for his not being
in a position today to deliver the following message here in person.
However, I am honoured to represent the Free State in this debate and I
would like to use this opportunity to put forward some of the main concerns
of our province at this stage.

Firstly, the issue of HIV/Aids and moral renewal: The Free State firmly
believes that the quest for moral renewal should be taken up by each and
every individual and organisation. Without moral renewal, our chances to
beat the odds against the killer disease of HIV/Aids are becoming very
slim. I do not have to remind members that statistics about the disease
paint a bleak picture, and the Free State is of the opinion that there are
no better people to address the pandemic of HIV/Aids than young people.
Young people, including those living with HIV/Aids, must become an integral
part of establishing and implementing programmes to address the virus and
its devastating effects on our society.

Who better than the young people to advocate for the needs and rights of
people living with Aids? Who better than the young people to promote an
image of positive living amongst the youth? Who better than the young
people to support the existing programmes for the prevention of HIV
infections? No matter what our vision of the future is, the fact is that if
we do not all join in the fight against HIV/Aids, we might not even have a
future.

Addressing morality, especially amongst our youth, is a priority in the
Free State. We are using every possible opportunity to implore our people
to make a choice for clean and healthy living. On 31 October the Premier of
the Free State called a meeting of religious leaders in the province to ask
their assistance in guiding the restoration of a value system that honours
people-centred development and a good quality of life for our communities
and cities. The church must help to restore a value system amongst our
people which does not allow for tolerance of corruption, a value system
that refuses to accept crime, especially those violent crimes that are
perpetrated against helpless elderly people, women and children. The church
has a duty to assist in establishing a new moral order in South Africa with
an acceptable culture of ethics and a stabilising system of values. Our
people must be led to realise that ethics and moral values come from
within.

The Free State government called on the church leaders to assist in
launching a moral crusade to help develop a nurturing society where
reconciliation, peace and stability would become part of the spiritual
being of all our people.

The recent merger between two giant business federations is a clear
indication of the commitment of the business sector to the realisation of
the goals of the African Renaissance. The establishment of Newco will
solicit the initial support of the SA Chamber of Business for the
President's approach to the Zimbabwean question.

The Free State is also taking a firm stand against brutality and racism.
The year 2000 and the conference on racism have shed light on this evil
practice that must be rooted out of our society. While these racist
practices still occur every day and are telling the world a story of racial
hatred and brutality, we believe that the goodwill and love existing among
the greater part of our nation's people should be utilised to nip this new
wave of racial injustice in the bud and show the world that we are indeed
capable of nation-building and moral restitution. The Free State has
declared war on moral decay and racism. This is as far as the message from
our hon Premier of the Free State goes.

Allow me to commend the hon the Deputy President, as well as the President,
but before doing so, I would like to relate to them a message from a very
ordinary person in the street. Some time ago there was an onslaught on the
profile of the Deputy President and the President, and the media were
asking: ``Who are they?'' I was walking around and I was being asked this
question repeatedly, until I met this old man in the street. I asked him,
because I needed an answer at that point in time because of the inundation
from the media: ``Who do you think the Deputy President and the President
are?'' He told me: ``They are circumspect sages''. I would like to
underscore that in the following way.

I think that the quest by our leadership in Government to normalise South
Africa, not only in a contemporary sense, but in an international sense, is
not something that only we as South Africans will derive benefit from. I
think it is something that the whole world will derive benefit from.

Somebody said in this House earlier: ``It is time that Africa stopped
giving to the rest of the world and started giving to itself.'' But I would
like to add something, namely that it is time that the rest of the world
also started giving back to Africa what is rightfully Africa's.

When you came into this debate, Chairperson, your submission in this House,
in conjunction with that of the Deputy President, actually sculpted an
image of what the NCOP is. As I was sitting here listening, the only
inference I could draw - or, let me say, the only conclusion I could draw -
was that the NCOP is the glue that is supposed to cement this fragmented
nation that we are trying so desperately to establish. Hon members may ask
why I say ``desperately'', but I will come back to that later.

While many hon members sit here, they must ask themselves: Is this House
presenting the interests of provinces?

When the tumult of the local government elections is over, the nation will
still be looking to this House for leadership and direction. When one looks
at the Constitution, the trajectory cast by the Constitution is that it is
actually the responsibility of this House to take the nation by the hand
and to lead it.

I would subtly like to warn all members, or maybe not warn, but to ask all
members of this House that when the fun pertaining to local government
elections is over, we still lead because it is expected of us to lead. The
legitimacy of the ANC Government is unquestionable, and I think anybody
trying to question that legitimacy is looking for ice in hell, and I do not
think one can get that in hell. [Laughter.]

I have friends in the opposition parties. I am not saying this from the
perspective of artificial affection. I am saying this because I think there
is fidelity there, and it is starting to build. I think even they have
admitted that it will take some time to get things to where we want to be.
I would also like to do something else.

In prehistoric times the only mode of transport was dinosaurs. But the
problem that people had at that time was that these animals had two brains,
some in the front and some in the tail end. [Laughter.] As time went by,
they evolved into two distinct species - those with heads on top, and those
with heads on the bottom. [Laughter.]

When one looks at the make-up of the DA, one finds that there are
enlightened persons. But DA stands for dinosaur age, and so one finds that
there is overdrive in reverse mode. [Laughter.]

I think elections sometimes afford us the time to play politically, but at
the end of the day what we should do is listen to what the Deputy President
has told us. He has asked us to work together, as political parties,
towards a common goal. The question is: What is that common goal?

Sometimes when one listens to people depict principles of the African
Renaissance, one asks oneself what exactly are they talking about, because
the emphasis is on multiculturalism, with which I have no problem. But a
common African identity is absent in that argument. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, that was a fine speech, and I think it is very,
very important that we do unite around certain national goals. I want to
talk about one of those goals today, as we are discussing challenges to our
nation and how we are responding to them, and we will hopefully provide
some solutions.
I believe that one of the common goals is that of globalisation. I think
the Government has done extremely well in projecting us onto that path.
This is a path, I believe, most South Africans are united about, and there
is no going back. However, we need to understand what it means and what
responsibilities it brings with it. Globalisation means not only the
movement of goods, services and information, but also the movement of
skills, in other words, of people who are carriers of those skills.

The champions in the globalisation stakes are the open economies and the
open societies. They are the ones that attract and welcome capital and
skills, and over the centuries one will find economic growth being fostered
by upward mobility, education and migration of skilled people. The
Australians, the Canadians, the Dutch, the Brazilians, the South Africans
and the Americans have used wave after wave of immigrants from Europe, Asia
and Africa to elevate and grow their societies and their economies. We have
seen major intercontinental migration from South and Central America to the
US and Canada, and, lately, from Eastern Europe to Western Europe.

As a matter of fact, there are more people of colour, that is Africans,
Caribbeans and Asians, in the UK and Holland than there are whites in South
Africa. That is interesting, and the product of that migration. In
addition, of course, there is something like half a million white South
Africans in the UK alone.

The postwar government - the NP government, failed this country miserably
in the immediate postwar period when they shut the door on immigration,
because they shut the door on growth and on the ability of this country to
become a major player at that stage. It was a mistake, but we, in this
generation, must not make the same mistake again.

Skilled immigrants do not take people's jobs - they make jobs for people.
But what do we do? I ask this not because I want to score points against
the Deputy President, because this is too important. The reality is that we
throw every bureaucratic obstruction in the path of the skilled people who
want to come, and we do nothing to discourage those who are leaving.

Now we come with a Bill in order to levy immigrants, as if people are
rushing to get into this country. There is an old law which goes: If you
want less of something tax it; if you want more of something subsidise it.
From 1994 we have had a honeymoon with the world. That honeymoon is rapidly
coming to an end like all honeymoons do. We must take our chances now,
because if we do not we may not have another chance for several
generations.

Our problem is not only emigration, but the lack of compensation for
immigration. In other words, we suffer net losses of skilled workers. As a
result, we drive up the salaries of those remaining, we have more
mechanisation and more job losses, with a spiral going downwards.

In 1964 we had a net gain of 32 000 immigrants. In 1974 it was 28 000, and
in 1984 it was 20 000. In 1994 we lost over 3 300, and in 1999 we lost 4
730 as a balance. Members know and I know that those figures are hopelessly
understated. We, at present, have a shortage of managers in the amount of
something like 300 000 to 500 000. Even though wonderful work has been done
in our education system - and we are not talking about the good things that
should be done now - the Deputy President will know that the fact is that
our education system is not delivering fast enough. Development and
delivery require capacity, capacity requires skills, and skills require
education, skills transformation and also then the movement of people.

The Deputy President will know that capital is a coward. It moves from high-
risk to low-risk environments. Money is fungible. It moves from high-tax to
low-tax environments. One cannot stop it. No government has been born that
can stop it. We need to make ourselves tax attractive, but what are we
doing? We are pushing up the effective rates of tax. [Time expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, I just want to ask whether it is proper for
members to shout and scream in this House and then to go away without
listening to what other people have to say, to very, very constructive
discussions.

Deputy President, premiers, MECs and members of this august House, I stand
here before hon members in the presence of our Deputy President, Mr Jacob
Zuma, to raise very pertinent issues in relation to the finances of
provincial and local government.

We are all aware that before resources are allocated to provinces, the
Financial and Fiscal Commission makes recommendations on how these
resources ought to be distributed equitably to all spheres of government.
Moreover, before the resources are divided among the different spheres of
government, central Government first sets aside resources to honour its
debt obligation and reserves for contingency purposes. Contingency funds
deal with unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances and allow Government to
make funds available for natural disasters in case they occur. Thereafter,
what is left is divided among the three spheres of government - that is,
national, provincial and local government.

The FFC is an important institution in relation to the NCOP because their
work and findings have particular and direct relevance for the division of
revenue, bearing in mind that the division of revenue is crucial to the
functioning of this House, as it pertains to section-76 legislation. I want
to assure this House that the Select Committee on Finance is working and
will work tirelessly to further clarify the relationship between
institutions engaging on the Budget. Currently the FFC has to report to
Parliament and to all nine provincial legislatures. Their documents on the
costed norms approach, as tabled in May this year, have been circulated to
all provinces so that discussions on their recommendations for the medium-
term framework for 2000-04 could commence early in the next year, both in
the select committee and in the provincial legislatures.

We are very happy to report that difficulties in relation to the
disbursement of funds to provinces, particularly on conditional grants,
have been adequately resolved by the insertion of a new clause in the
Division of Revenue Act of 2000 which allows the Minister of Finance to
convert the unutilised conditional grants into a provincial equitable share
or local government equitable share.

The Act also provides for the periodic release of funds to provinces and
local government, which was not the case in the past. We were also informed
by the quarterly reports released by the national Treasury that there are
some provinces that are doing very well in meeting their targets in terms
of their spending patterns. Some have only spent about 20% of their budget
as we are talking right now. But there are also provinces that are
experiencing difficulties in meeting their targets. However, we appeal to
these provinces not to compromise on service delivery. What really happens
in these provinces is what economists term as ``fiscal dumping''.
In the last quarter of the financial year provinces have a disproportionate
access to resources, which are really spillovers from the previous quarters
and as a result incur massive spending which adversely affects the
continuous or smooth delivery of services. This fiscal dumping should be
viewed as a temporary phenomenon which will slowly disappear as the system
of intergovernmental fiscal relations matures. However, an important
development of our intergovernmental fiscal system is a nonoccurrence of
unfunded mandates at provincial level. We hope that this trend will
continue, and moreover, that the Public Finance Management Act will go a
long way in assisting us in this regard, because section 35 of the Act
states that draft national legislation that assigns additional functions or
powers to provincial government must give projection of the financial
implications of that function or power.

However, our challenge in the near future is to ensure that provinces do
not impose unfunded mandates on the new local government structures. We
observe some indication of this when provinces transfer their
responsibilities of primary health care to municipalities. We need to
address this issue before it escalates. Although the Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review released in October 2000 informs us that spending trends in
and across provinces show that provinces spend more than half of their
budget on education, health and welfare, the question we should ask
ourselves is whether this spending is translated into desirable outcomes.
Therefore the challenge is for departments such as Health, Education and
Welfare to deliver quality outputs. Again, the Public Finance Management
Act helps us to budget in such a way that we achieve the desirable output
as required by this Act.

We will soon be considering legislation which gives provinces more taxation
powers. However, this needs to be qualified. Provincial taxation powers can
only be enhanced within the national macroeconomic framework. I hope that
these new powers will help provinces to raise additional revenue, bearing
in mind that increases in taxation bases are not a panacea for the
collection of additional revenue.

Our central responsibility is to focus on improving revenue collection from
our current sources. Many provinces are working tirelessly to address these
issues, and our Select Committee on Finance will undertake a study tour of
provinces in order to obtain first-hand information.

The intergovernmental fiscal review, which was tabled last year, raised one
generic problem, which was weak financial management systems which were not
talking to each other. I am proud to report that this is now merely
history, and I want to commend all provinces for their efforts in resolving
this matter, because without good financial management systems we would be
nowhere. The world we live in today does not give us a choice on such a
matter, but it is a must to have such systems in place.

Many provinces are moving towards having budget surpluses. Provinces such
as Gauteng are using their own resources for infrastructural development.
The key challenge for other provinces is to develop capacity in their
provincial departments to spend on infrastructure.

I cannot to overemphasise that reprioritisation on provincial budgets is
long overdue. One of the few features of the intergovernmental fiscal
review, tabled in October 2000, is its three chapters on local government
finances and spending trends. This House should remember that local
government gets only 4% from central Government, including conditional
grants. They have to raise 96% from property rates and taxes from their own
towns. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D D MABUZA (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon members
of this House, ladies and gentlemen, I am standing in for the premier who
could not attend because of a prior engagement, and I convey his apology,
Chairperson. May I hasten to say that you do not need to worry about what
you said. We are aware, as provinces, about the valuable work and
commitment of members in this House. We will continue really supporting the
House, and doing everything in our power to make this House work.

Let me join my colleagues in commending the Deputy President on his input.
He clearly isolated issues that are relevant, that matter most at this
time, issues that will remain high on our agenda as we continue to strive
for a better life. A good lather is half the shave. By that I am trying to
say that we have made a good beginning.

The achievements of the past six years have been remarkable and
unthinkable, but that does not in any way suggest that we have achieved our
objectives. The majority of our people still continue to experience
dramatic inequalities. We all agree, with one voice, that accelerated
service delivery in striving for a better life for all remains fundamental
and primary.

That will remain a guiding beacon for all of us. We are quite aware of the
herculean labour and challenges ahead of us, and I want to believe that as
a country, and as a people, we are better poised to confront these
challenges.

In the province we are doing everything in our power to address the basic
needs and the development gap which still confront us, especially in the
deep rural areas. The question before us is: How we can improve the
material conditions and the economic lives of our people in those rural
areas without disrupting their communal style of living? Our programmes, as
a province, of poverty alleviation and the provision of shelter, water,
schools, clinics, electricity and roads are well on course. They do partly
address the problem of unemployment, though not in a permanent way.

We are well on course in addressing the damage caused by the recent floods.
We have managed to repair the schools, the houses and the roads that were
destroyed. We would like to thank the national Government and those
individuals, the good Samaritans, who managed to offer in kind to assist in
our programme of repairing those damages.

Attempts are under way, through the restructured Mpumalanga Development
Corporation, to address the plight of the emerging farmers and the emerging
entrepreneurs, and the housing questions of all sectors of our community.
Hon members will note that the province is almost 60% rural. The questions
of farmers and farming are therefore critical. We hope these institutions
will help broaden the participation of our previously disadvantaged
communities in meaningful and sustainable economic activity, thereby
reducing the unemployment rate drastically.

We are making special efforts to ensure that there is collaboration between
the private and the public sector to address these problems. To be able to
successfully address the issues of social backlogs and income distribution
adequately, a climate conducive to sustainable growth should be created. We
are aware that it is our responsibility to create such a climate. We are,
therefore, trying hard to create that climate, and the confidence and hope
for a better life.
The question of HIV/Aids still remains a challenge for the province, and
the country as such. As a province we are doing everything possible to
increase the level of awareness about this hazardous disease.

We still believe that the permanent solution lies with us and in our
ability as people to prevent and avoid incidences and situations that can
expose us to this pandemic.

We are running campaigns in schools and other institutions where we think
the rate of young people who are getting this disease is higher. We hope
that this will yield fruit down the line.

On the issue of moral regeneration, as captured correctly by the Deputy
President, it is really an undisputed fact that we come from a past that
was very hostile and violent, and which saw the moral fibre and discipline
in the communities wearing away. It is really unfortunate that we still
have people who are lingering in that past, people who are still trying to
discover themselves, people who are still on a voyage of discovering their
identities, and people who still do not believe that the past has caused
this damage.

We want to call upon all because, for us as a country to be successful in
our project of building a nation that will uphold moral values and
discipline, we collectively need to be seen as different political parties
conveying one message. We need to take this fight, this quest for building
a nation that is nonracial and nonsexist, to all institutions that can be
found in our societies - churches, schools, etc. Our schools cannot be
schools if the communities surrounding those institutions have just
collapsed. We cannot speak of a nation if families have collapsed. We owe
all this to our past and, still, people here deny the fact that that past
has done us a disfavour. [Interjections.]

Let me also join our colleagues in commending the Presidency for the manner
in which it was able to deal with the question of traditional leaders. As a
province, we must show the Presidency that relations and co-operation are
at an acceptable level. As government in the province, we have worked hard
with traditional leaders to try to improve the lives of our people in those
areas. Very soon we will be granting people title deeds. We have turned
those PTOs, or permissions to occupy, into title deeds and that was with
the co-operation of the traditional leaders.

The hon Deputy President has made a clarion call for all parties to work
together for the success of the coming elections. I think all of us here
will be doing this country good if we could ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): The hon Ntwanambi
will deliver her maiden speech.

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, could I just respond, through you, to what
Mr Ackermann, who is sitting over there, said, namely that people need AZT.
AZT does not cure Aids. All we need in this country is a cure. He should
take note of that.

The ANC has been, and will always be, a nonracial and a nonsexist movement
that promotes women to leadership levels on the same basis as their male
counterparts. No other political party has written in its constitution that
women have a right to be elected to positions of power.

The ANC-led Government has made it its priority not only to develop, train
and empower urban women, but to give special emphasis to the plight of
rural women. The ANC acknowledges that everyone is created equal and in
some religions it is accepted that people are created in the image of God.
We are therefore outraged that someone, especially a senior public office
bearer, who has run away now, would have the audacity to criticise one of
God's creations. It makes him an ugly person as well. [Interjections.]

Many like Freda Adams have left this dysfunctional alliance and some are on
their way out. Not only did Freda Adams leave the party, but she has taken
away their support. Only last week women in Chris Hani Park told Mr Marais
that they were also ugly and asked him whether he had forgotten that they,
like those in other areas, needed money from social services. The NP,
together with the DP, have misled us. They have failed the women of this
province. What is worse, the NP is now grumbling in the belly of the DP.
[Interjections.] They are.

Women in the townships of the Western Cape have not benefited from the
social services funding. Instead, most have had their funding cut without
any reason. The MEC responsible boasted of having helped women to start up
projects, but only three areas have actually received that funding. It is
also significant that the areas receiving this funding are areas where he
has support. He is not an MEC for support but an MEC for all people.

This Government has created structures, in all sectors, that are geared
towards improving the lives of women, including Mrs Versveld's. [Laughter.]
In almost all the provinces, with the exception of the Western Cape, there
are currently offices for the status of women. This definitely affects the
budget processes, and what happens in the Western Cape leaves much to be
desired. Yes, there is no office on the status of women in this province. I
live here and I was born here. I know what I am saying.

If one were to ask for the breakdown of employees in this province, one
would find that out of 50 persons employed in top official positions, there
would only be one or two women. Of these two women, neither would be
African. [Interjections.]

The MEC was quoted as saying that there are no competent women in this
province. [Interjections.] Even last Sunday, the hon Mr Marais could not
debate with the solid and dignified Lynne Brown because there is nothing
that he has done for the women of this province. [Interjections.]
[Applause.] He has chosen to run away. It is a pity that he is not here.

When Mr Marais was the MEC for Local Government in our province, instead of
making sure that women developed and were trained for leadership positions,
he chose the path of taking the national Government to court where he
subsequently lost. That money could have been used to develop women
councillors. We have come to expect that kind of behaviour from him,
because when he was in the House of Representatives, there were no women.
If there were any, there were one or two.

Why is the Democratic Alliance, particularly the MEC, so quiet on the
subject of the woman who is salaried and who is their candidate but also
draws a state grant? Why are they not mentioning that? That is a scandal.
[Interjections.] I say to Mrs Versfeld that that is a scandal.
[Interjections.] Is it provincial money which is going to be paid when Mr
Marais loses the case against Frieda Adams?
We still need the response which Mr Marais promised women two weeks ago
when they went to see him. They all sang in one voice: ``Out you go, Mr
Marais; in you come, Lynne Brown.'' He promised to answer but, up to now,
nothing has been forthcoming. I must say now that no DA can politically
ruin Lynne Brown. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms C MABUZA (Northern Province): Chairperson, Deputy President and hon
members, the year 2000 brought significant progress to the people of the
Northern Province on the road towards development and the deepening of our
democratic system.

All members will recall that the Northern Province was affected very
greatly by the worst natural disaster that has visited our region in living
memory. The rains and floods washed away countless homes and destroyed some
of the province's most vital infrastructure such as roads and bridges.

I am pleased to report that the province is in the process of recovering
from the disaster. The worst of the times brought to the fore the best
human qualities of our people. We received generous contributions from
companies in the private sector and from individuals who opened their
hearts to respond to the plight of the flood victims. The disaster has left
its scars on the region and a significant portion of our annual provincial
budget had to be shifted towards flood relief and the reconstruction of
vital infrastructure.

The Northern Province is on the verge of a new chapter in its social and
economic development. We have to meet the challenges of sustained economic
growth and the creation of a society filled with hope and expectations for
all our people.

Early in 2000, we held a very successful growth and development summit
which was attended by more than 400 representatives from organised
business, labour, the academic community, churches and parastatals. At the
summit, new investments to the value of more than R10 billion were
announced. The summit gave a new thrust to the Government's vision of the
Northern Province as a peaceful, vibrant and self-sustaining province that
can be a significant contributor to the national wealth within the next two
decades.

As a provincial government, our objectives remain to fight poverty through
development, investment and job creation. We live in a province and region
where poverty, underdevelopment, malnutrition, disease and illiteracy are
everyday realities for the vast majority of our people.

Our progress is supported by a wide cross section of provincial role-
players. In recent months, we have created a development oversight
committee that is representative of all sectors of society. This committee
meets regularly, not only to ensure co-ordination, but also to act as a
watchdog over government activities. This is a unique institution in our
country where civil society becomes a meaningful partner in both the
formulation and execution of policy.

Our economic policy remains focused on three important areas, namely
mining, tourism and agriculture. Government is committed to unlocking the
full potential of these sectors through strategic support in the provision
of infrastructure.

Last week we saw the signing of a formal agreement between the governments
of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa to create a transfrontier park
that will develop into the greatest wildlife sanctuary in the southern
hemisphere. This will turn our vision of a golden horseshoe of conservation
along the borders into a reality. The immediate target is to grow the
tourism market by 50% over the next five years and to encourage visitors to
stay in the province for longer periods.

In the past year we had constructive discussions with agricultural bodies
on the future of the industry. There is mutual consensus that food security
should remain a high priority, and that both Government and civil society
have a duty to look after the safety of farmers and farmworkers, and their
families and possessions.

At the same time we also have the shared responsibility to ensure that
progressive and humane labour relations are practised on farms in the
province. We will not tolerate the economic exploitation and physical abuse
of workers, including those from neighbouring countries.

In recent months there has been a disturbing increase in the number of
incidents that can be ascribed to racism or xenophobia. Some of these were
displayed in the headlines of the media, such as the painting of a young
schoolgirl accused of shoplifting, or the brutal assault on and humiliation
of a young man in Potgietersrus.

Without commenting on the merits of these cases which are currently before
the courts, we believe it is time that all political parties and concerned
individuals raise their voices against racism and intolerance.

Despite dire predictions in 1994, the Northern Province has been a haven of
good interpersonal relations and racial tolerance. All of us must join
hands to ensure that these good relations are not disturbed by extreme
elements within our society.

Our economic activities will be pointless if they do not lead to a
significant improvement in the quality of life of our people in the
province. We need to invest in the creation of a stable society that is
healthy, well nourished, literate and informed.

Although the official statistics indicate that the percentage of the
provincial population infected with HIV/Aids has decreased marginally, we
will not relax our vigilance against this pandemic.
Our HIV/Aids programme is gaining momentum. Earlier this month a provincial
Aids council was launched. Representatives from the broad civil society,
Government, business, labour, the churches and communities are joining
hands on this council to determine strategies and to monitor the
effectiveness of our policies.

A significant portion of our health budget is directed towards the
provision of primary health care and to bringing basic, affordable health
services within reach of every person in the province. We now have 360
clinics serving the health needs of the province and there has been an 18%
increase in the volume of patients seeking primary health services.

Education continues to receive priority attention. There are promising
signs that we may be in an upward cycle and that the programmes and
initiatives launched in the mid-nineties are now starting to bear fruit.
The provincial government has committed itself to policies of fiscal
responsibility and to the battle against corruption, fraud, mismanagement
and wastage of precious resources. Since the launch of our anticorruption
campaign in December 1999, we have finalised almost 1 000 cases where
complaints had been launched by the public or which were detected by our
own internal organs.

We are committed to the Batho Pele programme and to instilling a spirit of
hard work, honesty and commitment to service throughout the public sector.

The coming local government elections are only a few days away. We trust
that in the Northern Province they will be conducted without any problems
or disruptions. Once the rivalry between opposing parties have subsided, we
owe it to the future of the province to set aside our differences and work
jointly for the common good of all our people.

The provincial government is committed to evolving a broad spectrum of
stakeholders, including opposition parties, in both the formulation and
execution of policy. We call on leaders and supporters of political
groupings to support us in our efforts to create a provincial vision and
consensus. [Applause.]

Mr J F BLOCK (Northern Cape): Mr Chairperson, Deputy President, hon
members, the Northern Cape has started with the RDP of the soul by forming
an interdenominational committee with religious leaders. We are intending
to hold the second provincial conference in Kimberley in December 2000,
with specific focus on service delivery issues and social crimes such as
alcohol abuse. We will also look at family wellbeing, the plight of
farmworkers, employment and will deal with other issues. We will also join
the mainstream delegation to the Vatican in 2001 to address the role of the
church in combating moral decay along with the Government in our country.

As part of the Government's efforts to combat corruption and fraud, a drive
to instil social morality has borne fruit. The fraud and corruption
helpline has yielded its intended results. We need to identify all social
evils that need urgent interjection through our rural development plans
such as farm schools, skilled labour, job opportunities and recreation for
farmworkers. It is imperative for the province that our partnership between
the religious sector, the Government and our communities is strengthened.

The department of health, welfare and education has an integrated programme
for children infected with and affected by the HIV/Aids virus. We have
launched our provincial Aids Council, and part of the task identified was
the establishment of a multipurpose centre for people living with Aids. One
centre has been established in Kimberley. This centre offers skills such as
counselling, community mobilisation, and life skills to people living with
Aids.

We are looking at creating similar centres in other parts of the province.
We have established young ambassadors who target young people in different
parts of the region to raise awareness around the dangers of HIV/Aids, and
bring the young people on board with the provincial plan of action. I am
happy to say that preparations are in place for the commemoration of World
Aids Day on 1 December. The theme for that day is: ``Man can make a
difference.''

We have, as a province, taken certain initiatives. We have already trained
116 home-based care-givers. We have also trained 10 trainers to help people
who have to treat or live with people, family or relatives who are found to
be HIV-positive. There are 58 counsellors who were trained, 28 of them in
the rapid test technique. We have identified 2 sites in the province, one
in De Aar and one in Kimberley, for the introduction of a prevention of
mother-to-child transmission programme. Also, 28 mineworkers from Kimberley
and Harry Oppenheimer mines have been trained in STD/HIV training. In
recognising the role traditional healers play in our province, 53
traditional healers have been trained in HIV/Aids education and
counselling.

The Northern Cape has not been excluded from its fair share of racism and
violence. We had an incident where our MEC for safety and liaison was
insulted in Hartswater by off-duty SAPS members. This matter is under
investigation and the report will be due soon. As everywhere else, women
and children continue to be victims of rape and abuse. A case of assault
has been opened against a white farmer who unleashed his dogs on a black
worker in full view of the police. This matter is receiving the urgent
attention it deserves.

Farmworkers continue to bear the brunt in spite of changes in the province.
We believe that it is important that we also deal with the plight of the
farmworkers so that we ensure that the development that passes throughout
the country also reaches them, because they are the most deprived ones in
this instance. We are, however, taking the necessary steps to ensure that
we mobilise, inform and educate farmworkers about their rights to ensure
that they can stand and fight for their future and better job conditions.

The aim of the province is to develop an obsession with poverty and as part
of our contribution to the alleviation of poverty we have initiated a R10
million poverty alleviation project, which is an integrated project of all
government departments, targeting specifically women and youth. It is our
intention to focus on the real plight of women and young people.

The local government elections must in the end consolidate government
programmes for the poor, the rural and the unemployed for us. We are
confident that with our ``Cabinet meets the people'' programme we have been
able to interact with our communities. We have been able to inform them and
we are confident that they understand the real obstacles that we face, and
the role they have to play. We are confident that as government we will be
able to contribute to the upliftment of their conditions.

The new legislature building has been our own contribution to the
integration of the former township of Galeshewe and the white area of
Kimberley. This building will serve as a monument that will bring closer
the people of Galeshewe and Kimberley. This project on its own will help to
empower the emerging contractors and ensure that most of our people get
employment and acquire skills, and will also contribute to the economy of
the province. As part of our partnership with the private sector, De Beers
has launched a R600 million plant which will give a further impetus to our
economy.

A couple of weeks ago the City of Kimberley secured a motor vehicle
assembly plant. That in itself is going to give a further impetus to the
economy of our province. We are confident that we are on track and that our
people stand behind us, and the results of the local elections will prove
that, indeed, we stayed with them during the tough times and during the
times of success. [Applause.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, it is really an honour to follow on speakers
such as the hon Block, hon Lynne Brown and others, because we have heard
some remarkable speeches here today. I just want to start by touching on
that issue a little bit, so that we can contextualise exactly what some
South Africans are saying and what other South Africans are saying to our
in 1980 voters.

In 1980 when I was a young man we organised a school boycott. In 1982 we
formed an organisation called the Lenasia Youth League to fight the
tricameral elections. One of the things we used to tell the youth at the
time was that they should be patriotically South African. What we meant by
that was that young people must fight injustice, racism, and poverty, and
fight for the dignity of all South Africans and for a nonracial democratic
South Africa. What we were talking about was a simple thing - nation-
building - which is what we are talking about today.

Today somebody like the hon Van Niekerk can stand up in this House and say
that there was a German investor who came into this country and that he sat
down with the German investor. He unashamedly and unabashedly tells us here
in this House that he told the German investor that this was the worst
country in the world to live in. [Interjections.] He told the German that
this country had the highest crime rate in the world, the highest poverty
level, the highest Aids rate and the highest this, that and the other.

That foreigner has to tell the hon Van Niekerk: ``No, wait a second; I have
come to this country for a reason.'' The hon Van Niekerk - bless him - has
actually told us the exact words of the foreigner. The foreigner said that
South Africa offered him an opportunity to make a difference in peoples'
lives in a developing country. He tells a South African citizen who is a
member of Parliament and somebody who belongs to a political party that he
has a good reason to be here. [Interjections.] That is the issue that I
want to raise just briefly, because I think that the question of patriotism
in this country ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Sit down, Mr Moosa. What is your point
of order, hon member?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: I want to know from
you whether it is parliamentary to tell blatant lies in this House when
referring to speeches made in this House.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Moosa, are you telling blatant lies?

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, I am definitely not, Madam Chair. If you look at
the Hansard ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Moosa, if you are telling blatant lies,
that would definitely be unparliamentary. What I will do is ask that we
look at Hansard and at Mr Van Niekerk's speech to establish whether you are
indeed telling blatant lies or not. You may continue.

Mr M V MOOSA: Chairperson, if I recall correctly, a number of other members
remembered the same words that I remember, but the Hansard will show it up.

That is also an issue of patriotism, because when we speak about moral
regeneration and those kinds of things, we must also speak about honesty.
We must be able to stand up and hold our views with conviction. If we stand
up in the NCOP and tell members of the NCOP that we told a foreign investor
all these bad things about the country and the foreign investor said to us:
``No, this is actually a good place to be,'' why not be honest and say so?
I think that is also a question of the integrity of that hon member.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: You have just ruled
that we will not pursue this issue, and the hon member is doing just that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: [Inaudible.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Thank you, Chairperson.

Let me just go further, because the overall point that I want to make is
about patriotism. Let us go a little bit further. We have the hon Peter
Marais standing up in this House - he thinks we are all belligerent idiots
- and saying that we must fight poverty, we must fight this, we must fight
that. That same hon member belongs to a political party that has, for the
past six years, opposed every single developmental and patriotic issue
relating to nation-building that this country has attempted.
[Interjections.] I will go through them, in case Mr Van Niekerk sniggers.

When legislation was tabled in the Western Cape legislature in order to
protect innocent, poor farmworkers who were being oppressed by farm owners,
it was the political party that Mr Marais belongs to that opposed it. They
voted against it. When pieces of legislation dealing with domestic workers,
labour laws, the rights of workers and other issues were put on the table
in these parliaments, the political party that Mr Marais belongs to opposed
them. When land reform legislation was put on the table in this country it
was that political party that opposed it. When the issue of getting
medicines for South Africans at a cheaper price was put by the hon the
Minister of Health, Dr Zuma at the time, it was that political party and
the DP that wanted to foster the interests of pharmaceutical companies that
were reaping profits off our people. [Interjections.]

If one looks at a whole range of things, it is precisely that political
party that opposed it. But, again, unashamedly and unabashedly, Mr Marais
flashes the Human Rights Commission document to us in this House and says:
``This document says that we must fight for rights.'' His political party
opposed the legislation that created the Human Rights Commission.

Mr C ACKERMANN: [Inaudible.]

Mr M V MOOSA: Yes, I remember that because I was the chair of the committee
at the time. [Interjections.]

I must say to hon members that further than that, the hon Peter Marais
belongs to a political party that has put up 30 candidates for mayor and
district chair in this province, 25 of whom are white males, four coloured
males and one a white female. Where are the African people in that list of
candidates? [Interjections.] That is the political party that speaks to us
about fighting racism, about transformation, about being involved in nation-
building and, most importantly, about being patriotic.

Let me tie the point up by saying this. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!

Mr M V MOOSA: When Peter Marais told voters somewhere in this province that
people should rather follow documents other than the Constitution of this
country because the Constitution of this country was below those documents,
he was showing unpatriotic behaviour, and that was an act of disloyalty to
the Constitution of this country. [Interjections.]
I must say that when Lynne Brown says to this House that what we need in
this country is a revolution, she is not trying to score political points
off hon Van Niekerk and Mr Marais, and so on, but what she means is that we
need people of all calibres and creeds, all political parties in this
country, to become part of the process of nation-building.

The ANC - and they would not understand this - is not a political party.
The ANC is a social movement for change. The ANC has 15 000 branches in
every nook and cranny of this country, where, in little villages and big
towns, people huddle together and talk about how we are going to make a
better life for all. They talk about how we are going to deliver water to
the people in the villages, and how we are going to deliver
telecommunications to the people of those villages, and so forth. That is
what the ANC is - a social movement for change.

The ANC, by being the ruling party in this country, has tried to make sure
that Cabinet and Government and Parliament are a social movement for
change. Until political parties such as the DP, the New NP and the
``Democratic Mis-Alliance'' come together and try to be part of such
movements of social change, they are not going to understand what we mean
when we speak about patriotism and moral regeneration in this country.

But the point goes further, leaving them aside. Moral regeneration involves
building a work ethic in our country. Moral regeneration involves making
sure that we empower all the little businesses and all the people in this
country in order to become part of a process of spreading the wealth of
this country and poverty alleviation, rather than supporting the big
corporate organisations and big companies in every single whim and fancy
that they have. Moral regeneration involves taking the youth of this
country who are living, who are growing up ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mrs Versveld, when you speak in the
House, hon members listen to you, but when they speak, you read a
newspaper. Would you kindly desist? Continue, Mr Moosa.

Mr M V MOOSA: As the Deputy President knows, moral regeneration extends
further to the way in which the youth in this country are beginning to
adopt the values of a global world. The Deputy President mentioned that in
his speech today. Today the youth of this country surf the net on a daily
basis. Today the youth of this country are exposed to a level of media and
communication far more powerful than any of us can imagine.

That particular channel of communication to the youth of this country, who
are the leaders of the future, is the channel that we need to begin using
effectively in order to ensure that we instil the right kinds of values in
that new generation that is building up, in order to create the new society
that we are trying to build. We do not need the kind of rhetoric that we
receive from people like Peter Marais, who comes here and tells us that he
is fighting poverty when we know that the Western Cape has not built
houses; when we know that people in Khayelitsha and Guguletu still labour
under the same problems with a government he is in control of.

The Western Cape government has not used a whole lot of the section 76
power that it has to do the things that Peter Marais says they have done
and that the ANC, as the national Government, has not done.

So, at the end of the day, we need to be honest South Africans. If we want
to be patriotic, we need to look inward. Let us look at ourselves, and let
us look at our structures and our institutions. If we want the youth to
respect these organisations, let us learn to respect them ourselves. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Deputy President, the NCOP has
surprised me once again. The members have obviously been enlivened by your
participation and presence, so we now ask you to respond.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chair, it has been something to listen to the
debate. Quite a number of things have been said and speakers have raised a
number of issues. If I were to respond to all of them, I believe I could
take more time than they took, if I were to deal with each and every one of
them. So I will not necessarily do so. I will maybe highlight just one or
two issues that I think are important and need to be highlighted, because I
do believe that there were inputs made here that were very sober, very
instructive, very constructive and very helpful to all of us as public
representatives. I am sure that Hansard will have it on record, and that it
will be important reading to guide us as we go forward.

Let me thank you, Chairperson, and indeed the House for the opportunity. I
also want to thank Premier Shilowa who is with us. He is the only premier
who is here. I am making this point because quite a number of points were
raised about this particular House, its importance, its role and also
because the Deputy Chairperson, I think, wanted space to deal with that
issue in order to defend the House. I think he did very well in
articulating the feelings.

I am also raising the issue because Premier Shilowa talked about the
programme of the House. If we were to recognise and put in its place this
House in particular, as participants in this House we would have to perform
in a particular way. I take it that it was known for some weeks that there
would be a discussion today. This House exists in order, basically, to
allow provinces to participate in this form together at a level which is as
one of the national parliaments.

I therefore do not understand why premiers, generally, do not think it is
important to drop everything and come here, particularly if it is not a
question of this House saying it was going to meet the next day and people
have had the opportunity. [Interjections.] In my view, I think, we might
undermine the House ourselves if people begin to say: ``Maybe this House is
not that important'' and begin to complain. This is because we cannot have
a situation when we are having a meeting, a time for coming together
towards the end of the year, but we do not have all the leaders from the
provinces present, with provinces sending representatives instead, which is
fine. That is what we need to do, and we have heard what the provinces are
saying. However, I think in a sense it does remove something from the
House. That is why I thought I should thank Premier Shilowa.

It is not a waste of time to come to the National Council of Provinces. It
is, in fact, part of the work voters have given us. We have absolutely no
reason not to take it seriously, and we want it to be taken seriously by
other people.

I am looking forward to an opportunity, probably next year, when we can
look at our programme. I do not know whether that is one of the points
Premier Shilowa raised, because he was saying that the programme at times
is a bit of a problem. I do have this belief, as an individual, that for
people to be clear about what they are doing they need time to discuss
issues.

That means to me - and I do not want to reflect on my other life when I was
in the province - that one might need a sufficient amount of time, rather
than a day, to discuss issues so that one can have a fair idea of what each
and every province of the nine is doing. I think it is always a case of
headlines. I am not sure whether it would help me if I was not a member of
Parliament and I was sitting at home, listening, wanting to hear the whole
picture of the country, namely what is happening. It might be an incentive
also, and I am not saying that because politicians love talking, for people
to come and give the benefit of what they are doing in this House. Premiers
are therefore important. It would be one thing if there were apologies,
which is more the exception than practice.

It is very rare that we have the House full of premiers. I thought I should
make that point because to me it is important if we are going to look at
the role and the place of this House. This House is a unique one. It is the
only House in which we have all elements of government coming together.
This is not the case in the Other Place. Therefore, in terms of co-
operative governance, it is a critical House, but also in terms of
informing one another and the nation about what is happening in this
country. We cannot lose that opportunity.

If I had to take a final decision and it would be my decision only, I would
say that when this House meets on matters of this nature, members should
actually have a programme of more than a day, so that people have the
opportunity to discuss, debate and inform one another, so that we do not
live in the same country as if we are living in different countries. Some
become experts on their provinces only. They know nothing about what is
happening in the next province.

I believe that this House adds value to our democratic practice and
multiparty democracy. It is here where people come and debate matters -
where it matters most, in the provinces as well as in local government. It
is in this House where we have organised local government coming to discuss
issues. I would say that if we are at all interested to know what is
happening in this country, there ought to be some detailed report about how
our local government is working, because that is where things happen. In
any country it is what happens either in the big cities or in small towns
that will tell one what is happening. Therefore I would say one needs more
time to listen. Is Johannesburg as our leading industrial city doing very
well? I am sure we would be keen to know. Is the Western Cape doing very
well? Is Durban doing very well? Do we know? Is Thohoyandou doing very
well?

I think we need to look at it in one form or the other, and therefore to
give even that kind of representation of organised local government some
space, so that it is not just a question of having it for the sake of it,
but for the purpose that we have a total picture in our hands. You,
Chairperson, sitting there, you should be saying: ``I have a total picture
of what is happening in the provinces and local government.'' The members
here should be saying that as well. I think that in a sense will answer the
questions and the doubts, because it is the manner in which this House will
operate that will remove the doubts of whether this is an important House
or not.

I think it is very important. I thought I should just underline that point.
I love debate. I like people to discuss issues. If we all did this, then we
would not risk the situation of having people come with speeches and then
disappear, just to say ``I must tell them'' and then go, without being
interested in what other people are saying. That indicates something as
well. If we think we need to be respected in what we are saying, one must
respect other people as well by listening to them. They do have views to
put across. That brings about respect.

I think we have raised a number of important issues which are indeed issues
that face this country as serious challenges. But I think it is in the
manner in which we deal with the House that we could move in a particular
way. I have heard very exciting reports from other provinces, what the
provinces are doing, and I am sure other provinces are learning from others
because they are not doing exactly the same thing.

We have dealt with political issues and the history of this country. What
is it that informs what we are doing, and what is it, therefore, that we
are doing that should inform what we are trying to do to reach our
objectives? We have raised issues, the issue of racism in particular. I am
sure people become a little bit uneasy when this question is discussed, but
it is a reality. I think members must have time to talk about it, and we
must try to help ourselves to take it out of our system because it is in
our system. And it will remain in our system if we do not address it in a
particular way.

We have talked about traditional leaders. Again, this is an issue that we
need to deal with in a particular way, because the majority of provinces
are best placed to make an input on this question, as has been done by some
of them. The provinces are where the traditional authorities and leaders
are. I think it is important for us not to just depend on what the media
says and not be able to interact on the issue and help to find solutions
where we think we can.

The issues of rural development were also raised. As members know, the
Government is following the integrated sustainable rural development model,
which is quite critical to many of the issues that colleagues raised here,
about the changing of the quality of life of our people in the rural areas.
I am sure that at some point we could discuss that issue as a single issue
because, I believe, it is an issue that will certainly tilt the balance in
the delivery and quality of life of the people, given the fact that the
bigger percentage of unemployment is in the rural areas, the bigger
percentage of illiteracy is in the rural areas, and that the bigger
percentage of everything that is bad is in the rural areas. So if we
focused on it, it would be an important issue. We might at some point turn
it around.

We also have a programme that I think we will be dealing with quite
vigorously next year, which is the issue of urban renewal. We believe it
should have a different approach, because, so far, when people talk about
urban renewal they think about the city centres that are dying
economically, and they make plans about the city centres and not about the
peripheries of cities where there are squatters and townships. We believe
we have got to address the issue.

I am happy that Premier Shilowa talked about Alexandra - that we always
give it as an example. It is an example because it presents a very funny
situation. It is on the periphery of the suburbs of Johannesburg and,
indeed, very close to one of the richest suburbs, but makes such a contrast
and, therefore, it is an important matter to look at. I am sure we will
have time to deal with this.

There are many other issues that were raised, such as the brain drain. If I
had time I would deal with this issue, because we always look at it from
one angle - the complaint that people are leaving, etc, and, yet we have a
country. We are all here, and we have got to do something about this
country. It says something about our feelings of belonging to this country.
What is it that we think we need to do to help this country? What is it
that I feel even though I might not be white? I might be black or yellow,
but the fact that I want to run away from my country and do not want to
make a contribution is an issue that I think should be debated at some
point as a single issue, so that we can bring about awareness in the
country.

My belief is that parliaments are areas where national issues should be
debated in order to influence the population, the people who have elected
us. I think this issue does need to be discussed, not necessarily to
discourage people who want to go away, but to actually indicate what the
weaknesses are of people who run away when there are challenges. But,
again, one needs time to do so.

I do not want to deal with the specific issues that were raised concerning
how the Government is not spending money on everybody. I never knew that
the Government was selective in the manner in which it delivers to people.
One hears when politicians speak, and one needs time to deal with that. At
times it is well and good to make a political statement very wide, but it
is quite another thing to sit down and interrogate the facts and reality of
it. One of the things we need to do as politicians is to develop some
honesty so that we are able to deal with matters on our hands, which are
very serious matters and responsibilities, in a very responsible manner.

That is precisely the reason why we are saying that we need to identify
national priority issues. We, as politicians, should all agree that these
issues are national issues that we cannot politick about and that we should
be united on them. They are issues that seek to build our country. We can
find these issues. One of them is moral regeneration. It does not belong to
any political party. We have to remedy our society. What can we do,
jointly, if we put the interests of the country before our own interests or
before the interests of our political parties?

The point that I am making is that one might need to look at how we
function in terms of time, the programme and the issues, as well as at who
participates. I am not at all saying that the MECs are not important, and I
hope the MECs are not going to say that I am saying they are not important.
They are very important. They always come, in any case, because their
legislatures need them. However, I am just saying it is very important for
the premiers, as leaders in the provinces, to participate in this House.

Thank you very much for the opportunity and the debate. I think it has been
very exciting. [Applause.]

                           TOURISM AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr S L E FENYANE: Chairperson, I rise to give a report of the Mediation
Committee on the Tourism Amendment Bill. The Tourism Amendment Bill was
passed with amendments by the National Assembly on 19 March 2000, and then
submitted to the NCOP for its perusal and approval. The Bill was then
navigated through the elaborate NCOP committee process, which included,
inter alia, the submission of the Bill to provinces, and then the
procurement of sundry mandates from those provinces.

On 3 October this year the NCOP passed the already amended Bill with a
deluge of further amendments agreed to by the Select Committee on Land and
Environmental Affairs. As the Bill in question is a section 76 one, it was
then referred back to the National Assembly for its further perusal and
approval in accordance with the provision of subsection 1(c) of section 76
of Act 108 of 1996, affectionately known as the Constitution of the
Republic of South Africa.

Upon referral of the amended Bill to the National Assembly, that House
accepted some of the NCOP's amendments and held in dispute five amendments
to clauses 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill. The Bill was then referred to the
Mediation Committee in accordance with the provisions of section 76(1)(d)
of the Constitution. The Mediation Committee met on 1 November and
considered the Bill anew. Without any more ado, the Mediation Committee
adopted the NCOP amendments to clauses 3 and 5 of the Bill. That activity
left the NCOP component of the Mediation Committee pleasantly surprised and
somewhat amused.

The only amendments effected by the Mediation Committee were to the
proposed new section 21C in clause 4. The NCOP had suggested that the
national registrar should prepare and publish a code of conduct and ethics
for tourist guides in consultation with sundry stakeholders. The National
Assembly thought that the process would render the national registrar's
work intractable if she or he were to prepare that code of conduct in
consultation with stakeholders, as that implies that the national registrar
must procure consensus from all stakeholders before he or she can arrive at
a decision to prepare a code of conduct.

The National Assembly component of the Mediation Committee suggested that
the words ``after consultation'' be used instead. In legal terms, the words
``after consultation'' mean that a person may consult, but that it is not
mandatory for him or her to seek consensus before a decision is made. We
then agreed to insert the words ``after consultation'' in the place of ``in
consultation''. The NCOP component of the Mediation Committee thought that
that made a lot of sense, and it is hoped that the House agrees with us.

Roughly, 10% of the NCOP's amendments were amended by the Mediation
Committee. It was clear that the NCOP had fielded an able but shrewd group
of negotiators in that committee. I am singularly honoured and humbled to
be a member of such a committee. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Are you defining yourself as shrewd, Mr
Fenyane? [Laughter.]

Mr S L E FENYANE: I work with shrewd people. I hope I have learned from
them! [Laughter.]

I therefore, on behalf of that committee, commend the report to the House
for its adoption. I so move. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, KwaZulu-Natal will actually be abstaining, but
not because we are opposed to the amendments. I was part of the Mediation
Committee, but time did not allow us to communicate properly with the
province, thus not giving us a chance to get a written mandate from the
province. That is the reason for our abstaining.

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, unfortunately the Eastern Cape ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! If you are dealing with your vote,
could you table it when we come to it? I actually allowed Ms Thomson
because I thought she was making a declaration on behalf of the province,
but she was dealing with the vote, and she will have to stand up again just
now.

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, the Eastern Cape is abstaining. Whilst we were
part of the discussion in the Mediation Committee, unfortunately the
provincial legislature was not in session, so I did not get a mandate. I am
saying that we could not refer it back to the province.

Mr A MARAIS: Chairperson, this is not a declaration. I just want to say
that the future need not worry about what we are doing, because if we look
at the type of ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Could you declare your vote, please?
[Laughter.]

Mr A MARAIS: I wanted to say we will support the Bill. Our democracy is
maturing, Madam. [Laughter.]

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution (Eastern
Cape and KwaZulu-Natal abstaining.)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We congratulate the shrewd and skilled
negotiators. [Laughter.]

The Council adjourned at 18:40.
