                            WELCOMING OF MEMBERS

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Good morning, hon members. Welcome back
to the National Council of Provinces. I am pleased to see so many of you
survived your constituency work period. We welcome as well the Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. I see he has been doing some plastic bag
collection in the past few days. We welcome the Deputy Minister as well.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende sitting
van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die ANC erken dat baie van sy amptenare hul magsposisies in die
           party en die Regering misbruik om hul sakebelange te bevorder;
           en


       (b)  onlangse opnames onder potensiële en huidige beleggers bevestig
           dat die omvang van korrupsie saam met die sorgwekkende hoë
           vlakke van ander ernstige misdaad, verlammend inwerk op die
           investeringsklimaat van die RSA;


  (2) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om omvattende geldelike steun te
       verleen om 'n permanente onafhanklike teenkorrupsie-eenheid, tesame
       met 'n duidelike uitgespelde anti-korrupsiebeleid, in te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the ANC concedes that many of its officials are abusing their
           positions of power within the party and the Government to
           promote their business interests; and


       (b)  recent surveys among potential and current investors have
           confirmed that the extent of corruption together with alarmingly
           high levels of other serious crimes is having a crippling effect
           on the climate for investment in the RSA; and


  (2) appeals to the Government to render extensive financial support for
       the establishment of a permanent independent countercorruption unit,
       along with a clearly defined anticorruption policy.]

Mnr J L THERON: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat ek by die volgende sitting
van hierdie Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) van mening is dat daar dringend ondersoek ingestel moet word na die
       registrasie van kiesers vir die komende plaaslike
       regeringsverkiesings;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat minder as drie maande voor die spertyd vir
       kieserregistrasie vir die komende munisipale verkiesing bykans 'n
       derde van die land se potensiële kiesers nog nie die nodige stappe
       gedoen het om te kan stem nie; en


  (3) daarop let dat die Demokratiese Party 'n ernstige beroep op die
       Minister vir Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering, mnr Sydney Mufamadi,
       doen om 'n dringende verklaring in dié verband uit te reik sodat die
       registrasieproses drasties bespoedig kan word, en om in die
       verklaring aan te toon watter stappe gedoen word om die
       registrasieproses te bespoedig.

(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr J L THERON: Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of this Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) is of the opinion that there should be an urgent investigation into
       the registration of voters for the coming local government elections;


  (2) notes that less than three months before the deadline for voter
       registration for the coming municipal elections almost a third of the
       country's potential voters have not yet taken the necessary steps so
       as to be able to vote; and


  (3) notes that the Democratic Party has made an earnest appeal to the
       Minister for Provincial and Local Government, Mr Sydney Mufamadi, to
       issue an urgent statement in this regard so that the registration
       process can be speeded up drastically, and to point out in this
       statement what steps are being taken to speed up the registration
       process.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the Council, I shall
move:


  That the Council calls upon the Government to heed the calls of Amnesty
  International and to desist from entering into arms contracts with China,
  for, in the light of China's poor human rights record, arms could be used
  against their own people.

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chair, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, as the New NP predicted -


       (a)  many health workers refuse to assist with legal abortions;
       (b)  more illegal abortions are now being performed than before the
           Choice on the Termination of Pregnancy Act; and


       (c)  nobody has been investigated, charged, prosecuted or found
           guilty in terms of the Choice on the Termination of Pregnancy
           Act, reflecting a free-for-all situation; and


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  abortion legislation is misused by corrupt health workers;


       (b)  Misoprostol, a medicine with known teratogenic effects, is
           widely used as an abortifacient, in state institutions, despite
           it not being registered for that purpose by the patent holder;


       (c)  the Minister of Health has urged health workers to put duty
           before their beliefs - which is nothing else but intimidation
           and a threat;


       (d)  it is the right of health workers not to participate in any form
           of abortion for whatever reason and they can therefore ignore
           the Minister of Health's call;


       (e)  the New NP reiterates its position that abortion on demand
           without considering other factors is doomed to fail; and


       (f)  the New NP therefore calls on the Minister of Health to refrain
           from urging health workers to put duty before their beliefs, as
           it serves no purpose other than to hide the ANC's embarrassment
           with the failure of the idealistic, controversial abortion
           legislation.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Madam Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move at
the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council resolves -


  (1) to establish an ad hoc committee in terms of Rule 160(1)(a) of the
       NCOP Rules to investigate whether the hon Deputy Minister of
       Environmental Affairs and Tourism has been truthful in her reply to
       Question No 23 on the Internal Question Paper No 7 of 2000 published
       on 17 March 2000;


  (2) that the ad hoc committee must be formed and convened within two
       weeks of the passing of this resolution;


  (3) that this ad hoc committee be assigned such powers in accordance with
       the rules as are necessary in order for it to carry out its task;


  (4) that this ad hoc committee consists of six members; and


  (5) that the Chairperson of the Council appoints the six members of the
       committee.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Madam Chair, I give notice that I shall move at the next
sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the prevalent gross abuse of farm labourers and farm dwellers in
           Mpumalanga and the country as a whole;


       (b)  the racist and dirty campaign against farm tenants  and
           labourers, as well as land claims processes, through grave
           desecrations, assaults, intimidation and illegal evictions; and


       (c)  that there is a number of instances where labourers are still
           treated as slaves and subjected to abuses first seen under this
           country's first colonial powers 300 years ago; and


  (2) therefore resolves that -


       (a)  a vigorous campaign be initiated, inclusive of all stakeholders,
           to strongly discourage and, in fact, put an end to abuse of farm
           labourers and dwellers;
       (b)  all cases of assaults, attacks, torture, murders and attempted
           murders, and the desecration of graves be referred to the
           National Director for Public Prosecutions for thorough
           investigations; and


       (c)  an indaba be arranged for all stakeholders in Mpumalanga with a
           view to strategising on how to put an end to both this ill-
           treatment of farm tenants and labourers and the killing of
           farmers.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek by die
volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) Minister Balfour se openbare uitspraak teen Noksa se standpunt om die
       Suid-Afrikaanse manshokkiespan daarvan te weerhou om aan die
       Olimpiese Spele deel te neem, ondersteun;


  (2) van mening is dat dit skokkend is dat dieselfde Minister nou
       agteroorsit en toekyk hoe Noksa ``verteenwoordiging'' misbruik om
       Suid-Afrika en sportlui van Suid-Afrika onbillik te na te kom; en
  (3) die Minister versoek om in te gryp ten einde geregtigheid te laat
       seëvier deur Noksa te oortuig om die span wel te laat deelneem.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next
sitting of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) supports Minister Balfour's public statement against Nocsa's stand to
       prevent the South African men's hockey team from participating in the
       Olympic Games;


  (2) is of the opinion that it is shocking how that same Minister is now
       sitting back and observing how Nocsa abuses "representivity" in order
       to offend South Africa and the sportsmen and women of South Africa
       unjustly; and


  (3) requests the Minister to intervene in order to let justice prevail by
       convincing Nocsa to let the team participate.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek gee hiermee kennis dat ek by die volgende
sitting van hierdie Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die skokkende aanval by Harrismith op 'n Poolse
       egpaar wat Suid-Afrika besoek het;


  (2) 'n beroep op die Regering doen om hierdie tipe aanvalle met erns te
       bejeën omdat dit die beeld van Suid-Afrika binnelands en buitelands
       onherroeplik skade berokken;


  (3) daarop let dat van die verdagtes nog kinders is en dat dit 'n
       weerspieëling is van die persepsie dat geweld en misdaad gepleeg mag
       word en dat daar selfs vir kinders geen afskrikmiddel bestaan in die
       gevolge nie;


  (4) van mening is dat Suid-Afrika hierdie negatiewe beeld nie verder kan
       bekostig nie; en


  (5) daarom die Regering versoek om alle moontlike stappe te doen om die
       veiligheid en sekuriteit van toeriste, maar ook alle Suid-Afrikaners,
       te verseker.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next sitting
of this Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the shocking attack near Harrismith on a Polish couple who were
       visiting South Africa;


  (2) appeals to the Government to treat these types of attacks seriously,
       as they do irreparable damage to the image of South Africa
       domestically and abroad;


  (3) notes that some of the suspects are still children and that this is a
       reflection of the perception that violence and crime may be committed
       and that, even for children, no deterrent exists in the consequences;


  (4) is of the opinion that South Africa can no longer afford this
       negative image; and


  (5) consequently requests the Government to take all possible steps to
       ensure the safety and security of tourists, but also of all South
       Africans.]


         KILLING OF IFP LEADER AND MAYOR OF NONGOMA, MR J B SIKHONDE


                             (Draft Resolution)


  Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with disgust and shame the brutal killing of IFP leader and
       also mayor of Nongoma, Mr Joseph Bhekumuzi Sikhonde;


  (2) notes the presence of individuals who are working against the ongoing
       peace process between the ANC and the IFP;
  (3) calls on the police to leave no stone unturned in finding the
       killers;


  (4) gives its full support to the leaders of the ANC and IFP for working
       together to achieve peace and stability in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (5) conveys its heartfelt condolences to the Sikhonde family and the IFP;
       and


  (6) wishes a speedy recovery to Mr Mhlongo, who was critically injured in
       the attack.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
           RUMOURS REGARDING SATAN'S ACTIVITIES IN SPORTS CIRCLES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its doubts at the rumour gaining currency that one Mr
       Satan, a notorious underworld operator, recently elevated to
       celebrity status by a former cricket captain alleging that Mr Satan
       had diverted his eyes from the ball, has had anything sinister to do
       with a series of losses suffered by South African sportsmen and
       -women in recent weeks, namely -


       (a)  the Bafana Bafana soccer team losing to Uncle Sam 4-1;


       (b)  top South African women's tennis player Amanda Coetzer who lost
           to the relatively unknown Rosana des Rios of Paraguay at Roland
           Garros;


       (c)  top South African golfer Ernie Els who has performed poorly in
           recent tournaments; and


       (d)  South Africa's boxing idol Baby Jake Madtlala, also losing two
           recent bouts; and


  (2) notes that a spokesman from the office of Mr Satan, alias the Evil
       Eye-Diverter, is adamant that his master has recently been to the
       Asian continent visiting his junior directors in the match-fixing
       fraternity, and denies vehemently that he had anything to do with the
       break-up of domestic bliss in the household of the very same pastor
       who had received the confessions of the above-mentioned cricket
       captain.

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Raju, do you seriously wish the
House to adopt this motion? [Laughter.] Is there any objection to the
motion?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Yes, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Mr Matthee objects. The motion will
therefore become a notice of motion.

              RECOGNITION OF UPLIFTMENT WORK OF ROSEMARY NALDEN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die opheffingswerk wat Rosemary Nalden in die
       afgelope vyf jaar met selflose naastediens met kinders van Diepkloof
       in Soweto verrig het;


  (2) sy waardering uitspreek vir die musiekopleiding wat sy verskaf met
       die Nuskaid Soweto String Project;


  (3) haar gelukwens met die sukses wat sy behaal met die groep se optrede
       ook in die buiteland; en


  (4) haar bedank vir die kultuur van leer wat geskep word, die
       opheffingswerk wat gedoen word onder die jeug en die skep van
       beroepsvaardighede vir jong mense in die voorheen agtergeblewe
       gemeenskappe.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the upliftment work that Rosemary Nalden has been performing
       with selfless charity over the past five years with the children of
       Diepkloof in Soweto;


  (2) expresses its appreciation for the musical training provided by her
       with the Nuskaid Soweto String Project;


  (3) congratulates her on the success she is achieving with the group's
       performances, abroad as well; and


  (4) thanks her for the culture of learning that is being created, the
       upliftment that is taking place among the youth and the creation of
       professional skills for young people in the previously disadvantaged
       communities.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          ACCIDENT ON VANRHYNS PASS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mev J WITBOOI: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met groot hartseer kennis neem van die tragiese en grusame ongeluk
       waarin 17 mense, van wie baie nog in die fleur van hulle lewe was,
       gesterf het in die Vanrhynspas naby Vanrhynsdorp in die Wes-Kaap; en


  (2) sy innige meegevoel met die naasbestaandes betuig, daar hulle hierdie
       komende Saterdag hul geliefdes ter ruste sal lê.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great sadness the tragic and terrible accident in which 17
       people, many of whom were still in their prime, died on the Vanrhyns
       Pass near Vanrhynsdorp in the Western Cape; and
  (2) expresses its sincere condolences towards the next of kin, as they
       will be laying their loved ones to rest this forthcoming Saturday.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       CLAMPDOWN ON PLASTIC POLLUTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the widespread support for the clampdown on plastic and
       supports the challenge of cleaning up South Africa collectively by
       all sectors of society, including big business;


  (2) notes that the attitude of plastic federations who could not care
       less about their product has made them part of the problem rather
       than of the solution;
  (3) notes that plastic is the most visible form of pollution, which needs
       to be nipped in the bud;


  (4) is of the opinion that we have to make sure that the costs of
       cleaning this type of pollution are no longer borne by innocent
       individuals and communities, but by the perpetrators themselves,
       according to the internationally acceptable principle of the polluter
       pays, whether directly or indirectly; and


  (5) strongly believes that more jobs are likely to be created by the
       market for alternatives, including re-usable plastic bags, which will
       have value and encourage recycling.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S RESPONSE TO TAXI CONFLICT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Democratic Party has always been quick to criticise
       the ANC-led central and provincial governments for not doing enough
       to quell taxi violence in other provinces;


  (2) wishes to draw the DP's attention to the fact that they are governing
       a province that is currently plagued by violent taxi conflict; and


  (3) expresses its concern over the suffering of the innocent commuters
       who are caught in the middle of this continuing violent conflict.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] There are objections, and the motion will
therefore become a notice of motion.

                  LANGUAGE POLICY OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad daarvan kennis neem dat -


  (1) die onsekerheid oor taalbeleid wat in die Departement van Justisie
       geskep is, weer eens in die praktyk gemanifesteer het;


  (2) die persepsie dat die departement se taalbeleid Engels is, 'n
       ondersoek tot gevolg het oor 'n prokureur wat geweier het om sy vrae
       in Engels te stel en dat die saak oor dié ``onprofessionele optrede''
       uitgestel is;


  (3) in die praktyk verwarring heers oor taal van prosedure en taal van
       verslag in die howe; en


  (4) 'n nasionale taalbeleid en -wet nou noodsaaklik is om rigting te gee
       aan die verwarring.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the uncertainty regarding language policy which has been created in
       the Department of Justice, has once again been manifested in
       practice;


  (2) the perception that the department's language policy is English has
       led to an investigation regarding an attorney who refused to put his
       questions in English and that the case regarding this "unprofessional
       conduct" has been postponed;


  (3) in practice confusion exists about the language of procedure and the
       language of record in courts; and


  (4) a national language policy and Act is now essential to give direction
       to the confusion.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL: Order! Mr Van Niekerk, I seem to recall
that a similar motion has been tabled previously in this regard. I think we
will look at the record and establish whether in fact this is so. I will
not deal with the motion procedurally until we have established this fact.
We do have more sittings this week and this afternoon, and will return to
this matter.

                          OVERPOPULATION OF PRISONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the unacceptable situation in respect of the
       overpopulation of the Pollsmoor Prison and other prisons in our
       country; and


  (2) requests the Minister of Correctional Services during the debate on
       the Budget Vote for Correctional Services in this Council on 8 June
       2000 to furnish the Council with a report -


       (a)  giving details of the position in respect of the overpopulation
           of the prisons in all nine provinces;
       (b)  giving details of his department's plans of action, if any,
           including timeframes, to address the problem of overpopulation
           in our prisons;


       (c)  giving details of what it will cost to address the aforesaid
           situation effectively; and


       (d)  indicating whether there is sufficient provision in the current
           budget for Correctional Services to address the problem of
           overpopulation in our prisons.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Is there any objection to that motion?
Yes, there is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of
motion.
  REFERRAL OF REQUEST REGARDING APPOINTMENT OF NATIONAL YOUTH COMMISSIONERS
                        TO JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the draft resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly, the request
  from the Minister in The Presidency regarding the appointment of
  Commissioners to serve on the National Youth Commission be referred to
  the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and
  Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons for consideration in terms
  of section 4 of the National Youth Commission Act, 1996 (Act No 19 of
  1996).

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I notice we have Mr Moss in the Chamber
who may have come to visit us. I am not quite sure whether he is in the
right place. I will be guided by the Chief Whip. [Interjections.] Could the
service officers assist Mr Moss to get to the right place in the gallery.
It should be accessible. The service officers will assist you, Mr Moss.

I am very pleased to see you here, but just as you would not allow me on
your floor, I also could not allow you on ours. [Interjections.]

     COMPOSITION OF PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION SENT TO OBSERVE ZIMBABWEAN
                                  ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the draft resolution
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Council, subject to the concurrence of the National Assembly,
  resolves that -


  (1) the South African parliamentary delegation being sent to observe the

                             (Review of Policy)

Vote No 9 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Madam Chairperson, in my
address on the Review of Policy, I would like to reflect on the state of
the nation address delivered by the President earlier this year in the two
Houses of Parliament.

In that address he said:


  At no other point of time have we ever been as well placed as we are
  today to take decisive forward steps towards the creation of the humane
  and people-centred society ... today, the nations of our common universe
  are confident that out of South Africa will emerge a thing of value that
  will contribute to the building of a more humane world.

Making the dream of a better life for all a reality is everybody's
responsibility. Growing and using tourism to achieve this dream is also
everybody's business. Protecting and conserving the environment in the
process, is the challenge that faces us as a nation.

From offering a simple smile of welcome and friendly service, to guiding a
tourist through our beautiful land, we can all contribute by sharing our
ancient and unique diversity of culture and heritage. The hopes and
expectations of the world are on this southern tip of Africa, as a leader
in the developing world, to set an example for nation-building and share
our experience in showing the way towards creating a better world for all
in the new millennium.

The responsibility on us is indeed great. But we have shown that we can
take up the challenge to create a better life for our people and be proud
of doing so. Even more exciting is the fact that in the process of creating
jobs and alleviating poverty through tourism development, we can also
showcase best practice for environmental management in our country, our
region and in Africa.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has committed itself,
over the next year, to work for a better life by growing tourism and
enhancing environmental quality and conservation, thereby developing the
people and heritage of our land for the benefit of all. The department's
plans have been aligned to ensure delivery in four key focus areas. These
plans aim to, firstly, create the conditions for responsible tourism growth
and development; secondly, promote the conservation and development of
natural and cultural resources for sustainable and equitable use; thirdly,
protect and enhance the quality and safety of the environment; and,
fourthly, provide accessible environmental and tourism information for
sound planning and decision-making.

In the same address, the President further said:


  Consistent with the decisions taken at the Jobs Summit, both the public
  and the private sectors have committed the necessary funds for the
  promotion of the tourism sector, commonly accepted as potentially one of
  the most important sectors with regard to job-creation. The work has
  therefore begun vigorously to promote the growth of this sector.

Tourism has been significantly boosted through an ambitious international
marketing campaign launched in major international markets. An additional
allocation of R100 million to marketing this year will allow this campaign
to be rolled out in a number of emerging markets in Africa, Asia, the
Middle East and South America.

Satour will continue to consolidate market share in key source markets,
that is the United Kingdom and Germany, and grow markets in the United
States, the Netherlands, France and Italy by 10%, while increasing tourism
arrivals by 20% from the growth markets. It will promote responsible
tourism by targeting high-yield tourists rather than generating high
numbers that will negatively affect ecotourism-based destinations.

At the same time, Satour is being restructured and a new board was
appointed to consolidate the partnership approach with the private sector
and to improve co-ordination of the marketing campaign. The reorganisation
at head office will be completed by June 2000 - that is this month. The
restructuring of the international offices will commence in July 2000 and
will be completed by March 2001. This process will be further informed by
the segmentation study of the priority international markets which will
soon be under way.

Government and the private sector will continue with the Welcome campaign
to highlight the important role that all South Africans play in tourism and
to improve the quality and service of the industry. Partnerships between
Government, the private sector and civil society are the basis for our
joint success. Once again, to quote the state of the nation address:


  I would like to take this opportunity once more to emphasise the
  importance we attach to the strategic objective of building the
  partnership between the public and the private sectors.

Last year the partnership between the public and private sector resulted in
the biggest budget, that is R160 million, for international marketing that
our country has ever seen. The challenge in the coming year is to take the
marketing campaign to our emerging markets and to put in place the elements
needed to welcome these new tourists to South Africa and provide them with
an experience which will make them come back for more.
One of the biggest challenges that we face in the tourism sector is the
need for black economic empowerment. This matter was raised quite strongly
in the National Assembly Budget Vote debate, and I am happy that the
chairperson of the portfolio committee is in the gallery.

The ownership patterns in this industry are particularly skewed. Too few
black people are involved in senior managerial positions. Too few black
people are registered as tour guides, and even fewer black people are
owners of tourism enterprises. It is therefore not surprising that so few
black South Africans are tourists in their own country. This is a state of
affairs that needs urgent and concentrated attention.

Once again, to quote President Mbeki's state of the nation address:


  The elimination of poverty remains one of the central objectives of the
  Government and the country ...


  Our activities will also continue to focus on the important issue of the
  deracialisation of our economy, and, therefore the encouragement of black
  economic empowerment.

During the recent Tourism Indaba 2000 in Durban, the striking absence of
black members of the tourism business was noted at the Minmec held on 16
May. Because of the seriousness of the matter, we have decided to devote
the next meeting of Minmec to the single issue of the involvement of black
South Africans in the tourism industry.

There are a number of opportunities for investment coming up. The SA
National Parks Board has now placed 12 of its lodge sites on the market for
proposals from prospective private-sector investors and operators. Nine of
these sites are in the Kruger National Park, and as part of the Lubombo
Special Development Initiative, we will be placing a string of investment
sites in the greater St Lucia Wetland Park on the market in August this
year.

I take this opportunity to encourage members of the disadvantaged
communities to respond to these business opportunities. May I quote from
the SA National Parks Board advertisement which appeared in this past
weekend's newspapers and which says:


  In order to reinforce its capacity to conserve South Africa's natural
  wildlife heritage, the SA National Parks Board is launching a programme
  of partnerships with private-sector investors. Under this programme,
  investors will be allowed to develop new private game lodges within the
  national parks or take over specified existing facilities and upgrade
  them to international standards.


  The first phase of this programme consists of 13 opportunities in Kruger,
  Addo Elephant, Golden Gate and Kalahari Gemsbok National Parks. The
  vehicle for private-sector involvement will be via long-term concession
  contracts. At this stage, the SA National Parks Board is inviting
  expressions of interest from conservation-minded investors with
  appropriate ecotourism experience.

The advertisement then goes on to say:


  South African previously disadvantaged groups are encouraged to
  participate in this process.

I would like to repeat that invitation in this House.

In February this year, Government and the Business Trust jointly launched
the learnership training programme. The aim of the programme is to train 15
000 people over four years in all aspects of the hospitality industry. An
amount of R115 million has been budgeted for, of which the Business Trust
will contribute R80 million and Government, through the Department of
Labour, has contributed R35 million.

In order to facilitate the establishment of small and medium emerging
enterprises, the Business Trust has also earmarked a further R75 million
for an enterprise development programme. This will provide invaluable and
much needed technical support to aspirant emerging entrepreneurs, and
therefore deserves our support.

The tourist guides Bill, which has now been tabled in the National Council
of Provinces, once enacted, will allow for greater representivity in the
tour-guiding fraternity. These are but a few measures. There is little
doubt in my mind that the issue of black economic empowerment will have to
be kept high up on our agenda for the foreseeable future.

South Africa's coastline and its coastal and ocean-related economic
activity which contribute very significantly to the gross domestic product
of this country must be managed and regulated in a manner which contributes
to the empowerment of disadvantaged communities. An estimate made in the
White Paper launched this morning is that as much as 35% of the GDP is
related directly or indirectly to South Africa's coastline. This is a
matter, therefore, of great importance.

I would like to repeat what I have said concerning the fishing industry in
my debate recently in the National Assembly. I said that South Africa's
fishing industry will receive special attention this year. This R2,5
billion industry, which provides 25 000 direct jobs and probably 60 000
indirect and casual jobs, with an additional 750 000 recreational fishers,
has an urgent need for stability, certainty and transparency. On the
occasion of this debate we announced the following as the way forward.

Firstly, this year we will issue medium- to long-term fishing quotas. These
will be nontransferable and conditional on compliance with a set of
criteria. Secondly, in July this year we will publish a policy framework
for the allocation of each fish species. This will set out the relative
quotas for large, medium, small and subsistence fishers. This will allow
purely discretionary and ad hoc decision-making in the allocation process
to be removed once and for all.

Thirdly, the grading of the players in the industry will be underscored by
proper pricing of fishing rights and applications. This is to encourage
small-scale and subsistence fishers, while limiting applicants for macro
quotas to the genuine players in the industry. Through this we hope to
start to weed out the paper quota holders so that the people genuinely
interested in the industry can start fishing.

Fourthly, Cabinet has appointed Mr Horst Kleinschmidt as deputy director-
general, a move which has elevated the Marine and Coastal Management chief
directorate of the department to the status of a full branch.

Fifthly, a dedicated rights allocation unit will be established to drive
the transformation of the industry. Sixthly, a high-powered legal unit is
being established in order to ensure the establishment of a requisite
capacity on the part of the department to deal with the proper
implementation and upholding of the law.

May I take this opportunity to report on matters related to co-operative
governance. The Minmec on tourism and the Minmec on environment have met on
a regular basis over the past year, with good attendance from the MECs. The
atmosphere at these meetings has always been very constructive, I must say.
I would like to express my gratitude to all nine provinces for the
excellent manner in which we continue to work and for the support I have
received.

In an unprecedented development, the provinces decided to agree to the
removal of the provincial appointees to the board of Satour. This enabled
the appointment of a board which reflects the public-private partnership we
have built in tourism. Other areas of co-operation have been in
conservation. The Eastern Cape has consented to the transfer of the
provincial Woody Cape Nature Reserve to the SA National Parks as part of
the greater Addo National Park project. Discussion is now under way about
the establishment of a Wild Coast national park in Pondoland with the
present Mkambati provincial reserve as its core.

The Northern Province has transferred the farm Greefswald, on which the
ruins of the great ancient city of Mapungubwe are situated, to the SA
National Parks as part of Vhembe/Dongola National Park project. The Free
State is currently considering the incorporation of the Qwaqwa National
Park, which is actually a provincial park although it is called a national
park, into the Golden Gate Highlands National Park. This will add more
value to the Maluti Drakensberg transfrontier conservation project, which
we hope will become our next World Heritage Site. This project is an
example of provincial and regional co-operation  as it brings KwaZulu-
Natal, Free State, the Eastern Cape and Lesotho together in a common plan
for tourism development and conservation.

In the North West we are collaborating on the Madikwe Tourism Corridor.
This co-operation extends into the Northern Cape where we have established
four tourism projects using poverty alleviation funds. With Gauteng we
celebrated Sterkfontein - the cradle of humankind - becoming a World
Heritage Site and look forward to co-operating on turning this into a world-
class educational and information site that will attract visitors from all
over the country and from across the globe.

The above follows on the successful establishment of the Cape Peninsula
National Park a few years ago. We hope that the strategic planning we are
doing on the Cape Floristic Kingdom, that spectacular park which forms a
natural spine running through an urban area, will make it possible for us
to have not only the Cape Peninsula National Park, but also the Cape
Floristic Kingdom declared a World Heritage Site. We also appreciate the
enthusiastic support we have received from the provinces in maintaining the
17 Ramsar wetlands of international importance. The conservation of these
intricate water systems secures the natural heritage of our land.

In conclusion, I would like to say just a few words about waste management,
a matter which the Deputy Minister will elaborate on later. Litter and poor
waste management constitute a major social evil of our time. Rubbish and
filth detract from the quality of all our lives, especially the poor. This
denies us a sense of pride in our country and in ourselves. It says to the
young and impressionable children of South Africa that it is okay to have a
``don't care'' attitude.

The NCOP, as an institution bringing together all three spheres of
government, can make a very special contribution to this war on waste.
Therefore I call on the Chairperson to raise the banner and to join this
fight so that we all live a life of dignity. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister, hon Chief
Whip, hon MECs present here this morning, chairpersons of standing
committees from provinces and permanent delegates, I am grateful for this
moment to participate in this debate.

We have a history which was not environmentally user-friendly and we have a
history of dispossession, and if we have a history of dispossession, not
everybody would be engaged in environmental issues. We have a history where
many people's roots were cut off, therefore they had to die a natural death
in so far as environmental issues are concerned. What happens if one is
dispossessed or one's property has been taken away? If such a person got a
chance, he or she would damage that property, because it does not belong to
him or her any longer.

How do we speedily make the dispossessed communities of South Africa aware
of their very environment? That is why what we are debating today is
extremely important. South Africa is a very beautiful country, seemingly
with an endless coastline, majestic mountain ranges, abundant wildlife and
unique natural resources that any South African would be proud of.

If one were to visit any of the provinces, one would find them falling over
themselves, bragging about the unique beauty that they have to offer. Each
of the provinces could be a potential first prize winner for being the best
province in the country. Ensuring that such beauty and natural resources
remain intact until the next millennium requires careful nurturing and
protection. It is the enormous responsibility of both the Minister and all
of us here to ensure that it remains this way.

Regarding the question of pollution, part of the challenge facing this
department lies in changing people's attitudes towards the environment. The
environment was never a priority before 1994. But this Government has
realised that for far too long we have taken our environment for granted. I
can safely say that the majority of South Africans have not yet realised
the need for environmental protection and preservation. When I look around
in my own province, in its cities, towns, industrial parks and rural areas,
I see ample evidence that none of us takes the hazards of pollution
seriously. Even if we change laws to ensure the protection of the
environment, but do not educate ourselves about the need for preservation,
we will be constantly wasting money cleaning up messes rather than
preventing messes from occurring.

Pollution will never be excusable even if it happens in our own homes. But
it becomes reprehensible when companies such as Iscor blatantly ignore the
rights of residents to a pollution-free, healthy and prosperous
neighbourhood. It is even more reprehensible when companies in this
industry pay only lip service to the protection of the environment. This is
definitely an issue the hon the Minister should follow up with vigour.

The Minister should extend his investigation even further and ask all
companies to give an environmental impact report on a regular basis.
Provinces and local government can also play their role by collaborating
with the national department in eradicating these criminals parading in
their three-piece suits. However, all of us, not only the Minister and his
department, have to be vigilant in our neighbourhoods in order to reduce
pollution.

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has an enormous
responsibility to deliver to our people, through transformational
legislation. The select committee will give serious attention to the draft
regulations that will protect the sensitive dunes, home to many species of
birds. My Minister will also share with hon members the concern that if
left unchecked, irresponsible boat owners could potentially threaten the
breeding ground of whales. We also need to commend the Minister for
following the example set by a small community which outlawed plastic bags
in their town.

We support the Minister in the challenge he has given us here in Parliament
to make this environment a plastic-free zone. We also look forward to the
White Paper on Integrated Pollution and Waste Management for SA.

This department has also proved that it cares about what happens in the
SADC region through the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal Development for
SA which is due for release shortly or has already been released. We have
all read with concern the reports on fishing quotas. Fishing communities
have spoken out at length about the inequities within the fishing
allocations. They have complained that they are now unable to earn their
living because of the inequities in the fishing quotas. They have also
complained about the fact that others players, such as the big industries
that are far removed from the coastal areas, have been granted quotas
higher than theirs. These communities have been led to understand that the
department has investigated this matter so as to assist subsistence fishing
communities to reap the benefits of the transformation of the fishing
industry.

It is long overdue, but we have read in a recent newspaper report and seen
on television news how a certain Ms Meter from Hout Bay was able to start
her own fishing business in her very poor fishing community. We saw this
woman's achievement as a very concrete example of the transformation that
this department has realised in a very polarised industry. We want to
congratulate the Minister on his efforts which have allowed our
disadvantaged communities, such as the Hout Bay community, to benefit. We
look forward to his department keeping us informed about more success
stories of this nature.

Tourism has proved to be a booming industry for South Africa since the
first democratic election in 1994. It seems that almost every day we are
either discovering new historical or cultural sites, or rediscovering the
natural beauty of our country. These discoveries, through survey marketing,
can translate into enormous economic potential for our country. However, we
must be vigilant that new tourist attraction projects benefit all our
people. The last thing we need is for multinationals to gain exclusive
marketing rights to all of our tourist attractions and elbow out local
communities.

The department needs to spend some of its budget to develop capacity in our
communities which will ensure that their goods and marketing are of the
high quality needed to promote international tourism.
In conclusion, I wish to thank the Minister and his department for the
excellent work that they have done. We look forward to working with them to
ensure that all South Africans have a better, pollution-free life, part of
which, we hope, will be spent at one of our many beautiful holiday
destinations. [Applause.]

Ms G S SINDANE (Mpumalanga): Thank you, Madam Chair, for giving me this
opportunity to participate in this important debate.

As an ANC Government we have been given a second chance by the overwhelming
majority of our people to further deepen the process of transformation,
particularly the question of economic transformation. Guided by the RDP
framework and Gear principle, I am convinced that we will not fail our
people. We dare not fail in our noble cause.

Already, the past six years traversed by the democratic Government bear
testimony to our unwavering commitment to the betterment of the lives of
our people. We have managed within a short space of time to turn around an
economy heading towards a meltdown into one that is geared towards an
economic growth path. It is within this spirit that, as a democratic
Government, we continue to seek viable economic options aimed at enhancing
economic growth and development.

The realisation of tourism as one of the vehicles that could be utilised to
spur economic growth that would lead to economic development is not
accidental. It is the product of difficult policy choices and extensive
research work carried out by the democratic Government. I might as well add
that tourism is not only an engine of economic growth and development, but
also a source of employment.

Failure to expedite this process would undoubtedly undermine our good
intentions. Therefore, the restructuring of this industry must ensure that
the racial demographics of this country are equitably reflected.

Another issue that calls for attention is funding. We can develop wonderful
strategies, comprehensive implementation programmes and well-packaged
projects, but if we are not going to direct enough financial resources into
this industry, we are definitely doomed to failure.

The issue of capacity-building, which the disadvantaged people desperately
need in order to make a meaningful contribution to this industry and to get
projects off the ground, requires financial assistance.

In conclusion, as the Mpumalanga province, we wish to see more resources
pumped into the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,
considering that tourism is currently the only industry that is better
placed to address the issues of economic growth, job creation and delivery
of basic needs to our people. Although as a province we have developed
tourism plans, we require resources. [Applause.]

Mrs C M CRONJÉ (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, I will confine my comments to
tourism because my colleague from KwaZulu-Natal, MEC Singh, will deal with
the environmental aspects.

When one reads the aim of this department, it becomes clear just how
appropriate it is to combine environmental affairs and tourism in one
department. The aim is stated as follows: ``Leading environmental
management and tourism in the interest of sustainable development for
all.''

Environmental management and tourism go hand in hand. In fact, one could
say that a clean, healthy environment in South Africa is the sine qua non,
that is, it is the essential precondition, for a healthy tourism industry
in the country. We should always remember that tourists perform a voluntary
activity. Thus,  tourists will only visit a particular destination if they
have a reasonable prospect of having a pleasant experience at that
destination; tourists cannot be forced to go to a particular destination;
tourists cannot be penalised for not going to a particular destination;
tourists will not visit a destination  that is polluted, degraded and
harmful to their health or wellbeing; tourists will not go to a destination
they perceive to be unsafe and tourists expect the residents of the host
destination to be friendly and helpful. In short, tourists will only go to
a particular place or country if they can expect to have a safe, pleasant
and aesthetically satisfying experience at that destination, without
plastic bags - I direct this to the Minister.

When the department expounds on its main aim by stating that it wants to
lead and ensure the development of responsible tourism for the benefit of
all the people of South Africa, we need to ask ourselves whether we would
come to South Africa if we were international tourists. And if not, why
not? And if we were domestic tourists, which we all potentially are, where
would we go, and where not, and what are the reasons for that?

What I am asking in essence is: How good is our product and how good is our
marketing? Which areas can we improve on to make South Africa a first-class
destination for the benefit of all the people of South Africa?

A lot has been said about tourism being used for job creation. Now, the
reason that these questions are of such fundamental importance is that it
is generally acknowledged that tourism can, in fact, be a major generator
of wealth in the country. However, it is also of fundamental importance
that that wealth does not only benefit the same people who have benefited
historically, and I am very grateful for the comments that the Minister has
made in that regard.

Tourism can be a powerful tool for economic empowerment, but we must take
care that we do not continue to empower the already empowered, because one
then gets into the spiral of the rich getting richer, and the poor getting
poorer. It is imperative that tourism contributes in a meaningful way to
the alleviation of poverty in South Africa. Therefore, as Government, we
have an obligation to ensuring that new entrants into the tourism industry
have the necessary access to capital and the required support, training and
mentoring to become successful entrepreneurs.

Capital and skills development are fundamental to ensuring that the tourism
industry does not only provide jobs to employees of big operators, welcome
as that may be, but that it is possible for new entrants to break into that
tightly-controlled market.

Tourism has, for many years, been considered an elitist pastime. In fact,
that is exactly what it was, and what it still is, to a large extent. And
unless we become very creative and imaginative in our thinking, that is
what it will continue to be. For instance, why do we not make a far greater
effort to ensure that every child who has not been to a game reserve visits
one before the end of the year? Can we not find a way to ensure that every
child who has not seen the sea sees it before the end of the year 2000?

Let us encourage owners of big tourist plants to become involved in giving
opportunities to poor people to visit them at reduced rates or even for
free, as part of their social obligation. This could be done during the off-
season when many beds are empty, in any event.

But of course, there are also many South Africans who have the means to
travel and to become tourists in their own country who, for a variety of
reasons, do not do so. We can think of the historical restrictions on the
movement of people. How good is our research on this market sector, and how
good is our marketing to attract them?

Turning to the actual Tourism budget, it is, indeed, heartening to see that
this budget has nearly doubled - that is called putting one's money where
one's mouth is.

So, in conclusion, I would like to say more strength to the Minister's arm
- he is doing a marvellous job. When he spoke on the Tim Modise show
yesterday morning, I wanted to phone in, but I thought it would be much
nicer to say that to him in person today.

Finally, I invite all those members who do not come from KwaZulu-Natal to
visit the province because it is definitely the most beautiful province and
the best tourist destination. [Applause.]

Mr S M BONOKWANE (Northern Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister, hon members of the House, the strategic approach of the Northern
Cape Department of Economic Affairs and Tourism is guided by the national
priorities of job creation and economic growth, poverty alleviation,
transformation of the tourism industry and the creation of a better living
environment.

The Northern Cape is the largest province in South Africa and has a special
charm of its own. Travelling over long distances through a rugged and
sparsely populated countryside painted with rock art by the San has served
to bring many back to earth and remind them of their place in the universe.
It has been discovered that tourism is one of the fastest-growing
industries, and continues to expand at a rate faster than the global
economy. In the area of job losses, it does become our responsibility to
ensure that tourism promotion and development is given our fullest
commitment.

Satour has calculated that 5% of foreign tourists visited the Northern
Cape, spending almost R3,9 million. Whilst this is a welcome contribution
to the provincial economy, it is our intention to increase both the
percentage of foreign tourists visiting the Northern Cape, and the amount
of money that they spend in the province.

The Northern Cape has a negligible share of the domestic travel market. The
domestic tourism market makes up a significantly large proportion of the
total tourism market. I believe it is time the rest of South Africa
discovered the rich heritage of the Northern Cape. Let us not forget that
it was the diamonds of the now famous Kimberley big hole that funded the
exploitation of the Witwatersrand gold fields and the subsequent
industrialisation of South Africa. Whilst the rest of South Africa's town
and cities were shrouded in darkness, the streets of Kimberley were lit by
electric lamps, the first in South Africa. The first electric tram was
found in Kimberley. Today there is still a working tram operating between
the city centre and the Kimberley museum.

Africa's first transfrontier park, the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, is
partly situated in the Northern Cape. This 3 million-hectare park straddles
South Africa and Botswana, making it even bigger than the Kruger National
Park, and giving our people opportunities for job creation and economic
development. The greater challenge, however, is to ensure that our
historically disadvantaged communities, both in Botswana and South Africa,
benefit from this process that has been launched recently.

The tourism vision of the Northern Cape is to promote and develop our
tourism in an economically effective, environmentally sustainable and
socially acceptable manner, whilst developing the province as a leading
niche market destination.

The Northern Cape is in full support of the national Government's policy
that states that tourism will be private-sector driven, but Government led;
and that tourism will be used as a development tool for the empowerment of
previously neglected communities by focusing investment, infrastructure,
development and improvement in visitor management programmes in
underdeveloped areas with proven tourism potential. In order to diversify
the product base, we need to remove bottlenecks and distribute resources.
This policy will ensure that, in the words of Minister Moosa, ``No stone is
left unturned in the quest to unlock the full potential of tourism.''

The Northern Cape applauds the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism for the number of initiatives it has launched and for working
together with all stakeholders to grow the benefits that the country
derives from domestic, regional and international tourism. The Northern
Cape is completely grateful for the poverty relief programme of the
department and is confident that its application for tourism
infrastructural projects will be approved. The hon the Minister will notice
that I am a little bit opportunistic about that. [Laughter.] These projects
are essential if local, provincial and national Government are to achieve
the full potential of tourism. It is only with collective resources and
effort that we will achieve our goal of a better life for all.

We support the Minister's campaign to rid our society of harmful waste and
to protect our environment. Douglas, a small town in the Northern Cape, has
taken this campaign very seriously by outlawing plastic bags and producing
cotton bags. Therefore, I think we need to encourage such initiatives in
our communities to ensure that we protect our environment and create wealth
for our people. The Northern Cape, therefore, is in full support of the
Budget Vote for the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.
[Applause.]

Mr K TSHIVHASE (Northern Province): Chairperson, hon Minister and hon
Deputy Minister, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to say
something about my province in this august House.

In terms of the published market survey carried out by Satour the
characteristics and tourism performance of the Northern Province in
relation to its neighbouring provinces and its overall performance are the
following. The Northern Province is a large and diversely populated
province, with an extremely low gross geographic product. Tourism makes up
a higher percentage of its GDP than that of any of the neighbouring
provinces. Of the total of nearly 1,5 million international arrivals in
South Africa in 1996, only 4,5% visited the Northern Province, and its
share of income from overseas visitors was estimated at only 2,3%.

In 1997 international tourist arrivals were estimated at 98 000. The
province has 71% of all game lodges in South Africa, comprising over 2 000
lodges with 6 000 rooms and nearly 13 000 beds, and it also comprises 40%
of the 404 hunting venues in the country, with 2 553 beds.

Tourism is a people-delivered activity and thus an intensive creator of
jobs. The World Travel and Tourism Organisation states that tourism is one
of the largest creators of direct and indirect employment worldwide. This
same impact is apparent today from the South African satellite account,
with 250 000 jobs in the travel and tourism industry, and nearly 740 000 in
the broader economy whose livelihood depends on the tourism sector.

Over the next decade it is estimated that there is the potential of an
additional 175 000 new jobs in the industry and more than 500 000 across
the economy, and that, optimistically, there will be an additional 800 000
new jobs in the economy at large. The figures mentioned above show the
impact and the future of tourism in South Africa, while 54% of all the
totals are, and will be, the impact of tourism in the Northern Province.

The tourist attractions of the Northern Province reside not only in its
diverse natural scenery and wildlife, but also in its diversity of
cultures, friendly people, and in their unique traditions, legends and
history, which make this place unique. The contrasts of its diverse natural
features vary from the Waterberg and the Bushveld, the Lowveld, subtropical
areas of the Northern Drakensberg and Soutpansberg catchments, to the dry
mopani and baobab tree-studded parkland north of the Soutpansberg, and to
the Limpopo.

Geographically its location is strategic as it is South Africa's gateway to
the rest of Africa, sharing borders with three neighbouring countries. The
warm climate makes the Northern Province a pleasant year-round holiday
destination.

There are five major cultures in the province, and a rich history which may
interest visitors. Traditional arts and crafts, and singing and dancing all
form part of the everyday lifestyle of the people. Apart from everyday
dancing, there are dances for special occasions, such as the rain dance of
the Modjadji, and the tshikona, malende and domba of the Vha Venda.

Even the numerous fruit stalls decorating the roadsides are part of the
culture. History, legends and superstitions add colour and a dimension of
mystique to the traveller's experience.

The area known as Venda, which means ``pleasant land'', is particularly
famous for all the legends and superstitions of the Vha Venda who stay
there, which gave cause for it to become known as the land of legend.
Certain cultures have a special fascination for visitors, because of their
uniqueness, such as that of the Modjadji - the Lobedu tribe, staying in the
mountainous Bolobedy near Duiwelskloof and ruled by successive generations
of rain queens with their mysterious rain-making powers.

Many people living in the traditional rural areas throughout the province
still stay and live in the traditional way, some virtually unaffected by
the technology of our time, such as the Maleboho tribe who stay on the
Blouberg. However, these areas are not freely accessible to visitors.

A few examples of traditional villages, presented as open-air museums,
portraying the traditional lifestyles of different ethnic cultures, exist
in the province. These examples include the Bakone Malapa, a Pedi kraal, at
Pietersburg; a Tsonga kraal in the Hans Marensky Nature Reserve; and the
Masorini in the Kruger National Park near Phalaborwa.

Ruins of historical settlements occur throughout the province, but some,
such as Dzata in Venda - which also has a museum, the museum of the drum -
are better known, the history being well known and accessible to visitors.

Archeological sites of special significance occur at Mapungubwe in the
Vhembe/Douza National Park on the Limpopo River, and also at the Makapans
Cave in the Strydpoort mountains near Potgietersrus. Rock art occurs in
abundance, especially in the Waterberg area. Examples can be seen in the
Masebe Nature Reserve ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R TOOLEY (Northern Province): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister and hon delegates of the Council, I indeed appreciate the
privilege of addressing this august House. I will confine myself to the
environment, as the hon member of the Northern Province legislature has
already spoken about tourism. Regarding the environment and quality of
life, there is an ongoing debate regarding quality of life and poverty
alleviation. It is something that we debate continually, and I would urge
the Minister and his department to come out clearly on the issue of
biospheres.

Biospheres seem to be spreading everywhere within our country, and yet
there seems to be a focus on land ownership where there should be a focus
on poverty alleviation. We would urge the Minister to come out on that
particular issue. However, I have been mandated by the standing committee
of the legislature to talk particularly on solid waste management.

We would like to start by considering the lack of personnel in the
environment department. There are only two appointed members for waste
management, while 17 posts are recognised. This may sound as if nothing is
being done in the waste fraternity. However, an audit has been done and a
needs assessment has been concluded. The outcome indicates blatantly that
what is needed is empowerment. Most waste management is done at a local
government level. In a province like ours, which is very rural, the
management of solid waste may be problematic if clear lines of
communication are not established between local government and provincial
government.

Owing to the ruralness of our province, as I have mentioned, and to small
villages spread amongst vast areas, numbering 2000, it has been suggested
that a collective solid waste site would be necessary. These particular
sites would have to be identified by scientists, and local governments
would have to manage these landfill sites. Here, again, we refer to
empowerment. We cannot have landfill sites without particular councils
having the ability to manage them.

Our limiting factor is the lack of personnel at rural government level.
However, with the new demarcation and the establishment of district
councils, this shortage of personnel may be resolved to a point, but
empowerment should still be the focus of the department, empowerment in the
management of solid waste and landfill sites by local rural governments.

With the assistance of its scientists, the department is currently
empowering the inspectorate division regarding waste management and what
the current legal framework stipulates. This means the inspectorate
division will know what constitutes transgression of the law concerning
solid waste, and act accordingly. We must place the emphasis regarding
solid waste management on the issue of empowerment. We must ensure that
personnel dealing with this crucial service know what they are up to.

The selection of a correct landfill site is crucial owing to leaching, and
leaching from rain. Should the incorrect soil be chosen, we could be
condemning our ground water, and what with this source becoming more and
more accessed by local governments, we must ensure that solid waste issues
are dealt with correctly, thereby ensuring that there is clean potable
water for future generations.

There is no doubt that both tiers of government have a role to play. Where
there is a lack of strategy in this regard, the provincial department must
and should assist in establishing a strategy. One method suggested is to
engage local governments and councillors, in particular, to discuss waste
management and the consequences of noncompliance.

The biggest amount of waste created in our country, as far as we are
concerned, is packaging, packaging meaning tin cans and plastic bags.
Whether it be a plastic bag or a tin can, the packaging industry is
definitely the biggest culprit in the creation of waste. When one thinks of
recycling, those who make the primary products, who make the plastic bags
and cans, are also the ones who recycle. One would hasten to add, the
recyclers are the Mondis, the Sappis and the Metal Boxes of the country.
Hence, the slowness of communities to become vigilant regarding recycling.

Recycling, surely, should be seen as a job creator. However, those who are
the major role-players in the recycling industry, as mentioned, do not see
this as an opportunity, but rather as a threat to their profit margins. Let
us create opportunities in the recycling industry, and, at the same time,
protect our environment for our future generations.

The Northern Province therefore supports the hon the Minister and his
department in the current policy adopted by his department. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, it
surely is a privilege to be the Minister of these two portfolios, for they
smell of potential and vibrate with success and challenges.

Although South Africa attracts only 0,2% of the annual estimated 300
million tourists in the world, they bring an estimated R20 billion a year
into our economy. Although we have had a 40% growth in foreign arrivals
since 1994, it is clear that we have only started. We have not even started
with really developing the Africa tourist industry, and this is exciting.
With all this excitement and enthusiasm, the hon the Minister must also be
cautioned not to be seduced by the many new possible ventures while turning
a blind eye to what already exists.

Let me give hon members an example. I understand that investigations are
under way to look at the Kei River area as a possible national park for the
Eastern Cape. I do not understand this, because very close to this area are
three very neglected and ignored parks. What is needed is for them to be
formed into one national park. I am referring to the Ciskei Park, the Andre
Vosloo Kudu Reserve and the Sam Knott Nature Reserve. The latter 14 farms
of the Sam Knott Reserve were donated to the province. There is thus no
need to start from scratch, or to buy additional land. It is all there just
for the taking by the Minister.

This also poses an ideal situation in which to engage the private sector as
in the case of the Kruger National Park and the other parks. Let the people
who know the business and whose business it is to develop, manage and
market such tourist attractions do it. The Minister and his department have
many other loose strings that need tightening, and we will refer to them
later on. This suggestion of the proposed expansion of the Addo Elephant
National Park will have so much to offer the tourists and the environment.

Ek wil vandag eer betoon aan 'n persoon wat teen die einde van verlede jaar
die Internasionale Biobeleidsorganisasie se -``Eerste Bioprys vir die nuwe
Millennium'' ontvang het vir ongeëwenaarde prestasie op omgewingsgebied. Dr
Anton Rupert van Suid-Afrika het hierdie welverdiende erkenning ontvang.
Wat die toekenning nog meer merkwaardig maak, is die visie van dr Rupert
met die bevordering en totstandbrenging van die wêreld se eerste oorgrens-
vredesparke, waarvan die Kgalagadi, soos my agb kollega hier genoem het,
die heel eerste was.
Hierdie konsep skep nie net moontlikhede vir die verwesenliking van ons
president Mbeki se Afrika-renaissancedroom nie, maar het ook die wêreld se
verbeelding aangegryp. Daar is pas 'n soortgelyke park aangekondig tussen
onder meer Macedonië, Griekeland en Albanië. Daar word verder gekyk na die
potensiaal van 'n park tussen Frankryk, Luxemburg en Duitsland, en ook
tussen Oostenryk en Hongarye. Dit is wonderlik dat ons die voortou neem met
die bevordering van waardes om 'n selfonderhoudende samelewing te verseker.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Today I want to pay tribute to a person who at the end of last year
received the International Bio-policy Organisation's ``First Bio Prize for
the new Millennium'' for unequalled achievements with regard to the
environment. Dr Anton Rupert from South Africa received this well-deserved
award. What makes the award even more remarkable, is Dr Rupert's vision
with the promotion and introduction of the world's first cross-border peace
parks, of which the Kgalagadi, as my colleague here mentioned, was the very
first.

This concept does not only create possibilities for the realisation of our
President Mbeki's dream of an African renaissance, but has also gripped the
world's imagination. Recently a similar park has been announced between,
inter alia, Macedonia, Greece and Albania. Furthermore, investigations are
under way into the potential of a park between France, Luxemburg and
Germany, and also between Austria and Hungary. It is wonderful that we are
taking the lead in the promotion of values to ensure a self-sustaining
society.]

It is, however, a fact that everything overall is not as good as it seems,
as reflected in the World Wildlife Foundation's Living Planet campaign
report that was released in September last year. It states that South
Africa generates 8,5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year, which is
almost as bad as Western Europe's 8,6 tons.

Planet earth relies upon her forests to suck up the carbon dioxide and to
turn it back into oxygen and carbon, but South Africa has already lost
about 73% of its forests.

Dié situasie moet gehanteer word, en daarom word die Minister se oorlog
teen besoedeling verwelkom, maar wat gaan gedoen word met die steenkool by
Witbank, wat steeds brand en gasse in die lug vrystel, en wat word beoog
vir die bekamping van lugbesoedeling in die algemeen? Het die agb Minister
die kapasiteit om lugbesoedeling, die storting van gifstowwe in riviere en
die see en besoedeling in die algemeen te moniteer en te reguleer? Ek sien
dit nie gereflekteer in sy begroting nie. Hoewel die agb Minister sterk
uitsprake maak oor die groot sondaars van besoedeling, is hy baie versigtig
oor die miljoene klein oortreders. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[This situation must be dealt with, and for that reason the Minister's war
against pollution is welcomed, but what is going to be done with the coal
at Witbank, which is still burning and releasing gases into the air, and
what is envisaged for the combating of air pollution in general? Does the
hon the Minister have the capacity to monitor and regulate air pollution,
the dumping of poisonous substances in rivers and the sea, and pollution in
general? I do not see this reflected in his budget. Although the hon the
Minister makes strong statements about the big perpetrators of pollution,
he is very careful about the millions of small offenders.]

We have accepted the fact that shoplifting is a crime but littering is also
a crime. He who litters, and it does not matter how much litter it is,
whether it is a factory dumping masses of waste, or the driver of a car or
a taxi throwing an empty can out of the window, or a kid throwing gum or a
piece of paper on the pavement, or a smoker leaving a stompie on the
driveway, that person is committing a crime. It should be regarded as an
offence because that individual is not only stealing from the taxpayer who
has to pay millions to tidy up this mess, but he or she is also stealing
the beauty of the country and, with that, stealing the good experiences of
our country's tourists and also stealing a better life for all.

I acknowledge the Minister's educational project and his own involvement,
but let us fast-track the process and discipline the offenders, for
littering is a crime.

Die agb Minister is nou al byna 'n jaar in die portefeulje en hy het reeds
talle goeie ondernemings gegee en ook self die voorbeeld gestel. Hy het ook
al sekere optredes begin implementeer, maar die tyd vir verskonings oor die
chaos in die visbedryf is nou verby. Daar is verskeie sake oor die
visbedryf wat die Minister vandag toegelig het, en ons is dankbaar vir die
stappe wat in die vooruitsig gestel word en vir die aanstelling van mnr
Kleinschmidt, maar ons sal ons taak versaak as ons nie net op die volgende
wys nie.

Die geskarrel in die bedryf is vererger toe besluit is om mense wat
voorheen nie toegang tot die bedryf gehad het nie, te bevoordeel. Nou is
dit juis hulle en veral die gevestigde vissers wat moet ly. Daar is mense
wat geslagte lank al vissers is, wat net die see ken, maar wat sonder werk
sit, terwyl daar steeds mense bevoordeel word wat seesiek word as hulle 'n
skuit op die see sien. Ons weet mos van die handel in papierkwotas wat die
Minister nou sê aangepak gaan word, maar hierdie chaos veroorsaak dat
stropery hoogty vier. Die Minister kan net sowel die regulasies en
beperkings ophef, want die stropers steur hulle nie daaraan nie. Dit lyk
egter ook of die Minister nie genoeg tyd daaraan spandeer nie. [Tyd
verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The hon the Minister has now been in the portfolio for nearly a year and
he has already given numerous good undertakings and has set a good example.
He has also already begun implementing certain activities, but the time for
excuses about the chaos in the fishing industry is now over. There are
various issues regarding the fishing industry which the Minister
highlighted today, and we are grateful for the steps envisaged and for the
appointment of Mr Kleinschmidt, but we would be neglecting our duty if we
did not just point out the following.

The scrabbling in the industry was exacerbated when a decision was taken to
favour people who did not previously have access to the industry. Now it is
precisely them and the established fishermen in particular who have to
suffer. There are people who have been fishermen for generations, who only
know the sea, but who are unemployed, while there are still people being
favoured who become seasick if they see a boat on the sea. Of course we
know about the trade in paper quotas which the Minister has now said will
be addressed, but this chaos leads to poaching being the order of the day.
The Minister may just as well abolish the regulations and restrictions,
because the poachers do not pay attention to them. However, it would appear
that the Minister does not spend enough time on this. [Time expired.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism, hon MECs and hon members, it gave me pleasure to listen to the hon
the Minister's address and to all the speakers before me.

Echoing some of them, I wish to mention the following on behalf of my
party, the IFP, and also my province, the kingdom of Kwazulu-Natal. After
six years of talking, I want to ponder the question of what marks or
percentage we should give to ourselves in this respect. I honestly believe
that we only deserve two out of 10 or approximately 20%. Why? Firstly, we
need tourism to halt inflation, beat crime, create jobs and boost the rand.
Secondly, crime is rampant, joblessness is rising, inflation is on the
rise, day after day, and interest rate hikes are threatening. The borrowers
are soon going to have sleepless nights, being strangulated by bond rates
and so forth.

We do not need to wait for a catastrophe similar to that in Zimbabwe to
happen in South Africa, our beloved country. We do not have to wait for
what occurred in Congo or Rwanda to occur in South Africa. Tourism is a
lifeline. We need to resuscitate the economy in this country. It is very
sad that we are failing ourselves in this regard. We need it now. This must
be the highest priority, and anyone who harms a tourist or creates negative
publicity to keep away tourists should be seen as committing a serious
crime against the state.

Each and every province, I believe, has several resources that could
attract tourist attention in a big way. Unfortunately, a lot of these
resources are not developed. When I think of the province that I come from,
the kingdom of KwaZulu-Natal, I can name just a few of these. Firstly,
close to my birthplace, there is a natural tunnel in a rocky place which is
one kilometre long. It is one of the wonders of creation and is known as
Ezinkonjeni. Secondly, the largest stone in Kranskop, known as iTshe
likaNtunjambili, has had several places named after it because of its
existence. The town itself Kranskop was named because of this rock.
Thirdly, some places have warm water which are known as warm baths and are
not well-developed enough to attract tourists in their numbers.

Environmental Affairs and Tourism should do a community diagnosis in each
province to identify these places which have such a rich potential to
attract tourists. This is just food for thought for the department and also
for all members who serve in this portfolio in all provinces.

Every segment of society should be putting up a welcome sign for tourists.
Every city, every region, every district and every province should make the
promotion of tourism its highest priority. Provinces that do well should
get a bonus budget supplement. [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, hon members, the main objectives of the
environmental affairs programmes are to ensure the conservation of
biodiversity and to protect the environment through the ecologically
sustainable, economically efficient and socially equitable use of the
environment in the Eastern Cape.

This is in line with the destiny of the Department of Environmental Affairs
and Tourism as depicted in the budget presented by the hon the Minister. Of
the nine provinces the Eastern Cape is currently the third most popular
summer holiday destination for domestic tourists and the fifth most popular
winter holiday destination for foreign tourists from southern Europe, with
the majority of visitors coming from the United Kingdom and the United
States of America.

A tourism indaba was held late last year with the intention of bringing
together all role-players to identify critical issues pertaining to the
province, especially where these hinder growth in tourism. We managed to
develop a way forward which will be easily monitored and evaluated. This is
the task of the Eastern Cape Tourism Board, as they are the ring leaders in
tourism.

The role of the provincial government is to formulate policies conducive to
prosperity in tourism. This may be achieved by developing further our draft
Green Paper on Tourism into at least a White Paper. It will also play a
facilitating role by devising mechanisms for safety and security, providing
incentives for the private sector to invest in tourism and providing
assistance to emerging entrepreneurs.

Local government is responsible for land-use planning in urban and rural
areas, the provision and maintenance of tourist service sites and
attractions, the marketing and promotion of local attractions, the
provision of road signage and facilitating the participation of our local
communities.

Currently, interaction with other provinces is minimal. However, the
national Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism and members of the
South African tourism industry convene meetings and co-ordinate issues,
thus making it possible for an exchange of ideas on issues of common
interest.

This province had a well-established commercial fishing sector worth about
R566 million in 1997. The economic potential of inshore or coastal living
marine resources is, however, underdeveloped and offers significant
potential to improve the livelihoods of coastal communities in the Eastern
Cape. Outside of the coastal cities and towns, the coastal economy is
essentially nature-based, and comprised of agriculture, tourism, fishing
and mariculture.

Sustainable environmental management and development support to these
sectors is essential for economic development. Sustainable resource
utilisation support to these sectors is essential, for economic benefit is
currently threatened by weak environmental management and noncompliance,
for example poaching, a lack of institutional support for economic
development based on these resources, poor institutional co-ordination and
a lack of strategic sector development planning.

Under apartheid commercial access to marine resources was denied to black
South Africans, and a clear policy to develop coastal communities based on
marine resources did not exist. Policies to address the imbalances of the
past and to promote sustainable resource utilisation are contained in the
Marine Living Resources Act, 1998, and the White Paper for Sustainable
Coastal Development.

These policies create opportunities for the development of coastal
communities and the coastal economy. However, delivery on the goals of this
Act has been limited due to a lack of policy on strategies for
implementation. In particular, policy on the roles of various Government
departments and institutions is lacking.

The economic growth potential of the Eastern Cape living marine resources
is substantial. Opportunities include the development of small-scale
entrepreneurs from coastal communities and optimising the benefits of our
natural endowment to promote tourism, and the associated job-creation
opportunities.
The wellbeing and sustainability of living marine resources is essential to
the growth of tourism. Mariculture is an undeveloped opportunity that
requires commitment to technological development and transfer. The
sustainability of the economic potential of the endowment of living marine
resources in the Eastern Cape province is threatened by poor environmental
management, noncompliance, poaching and a lack of institutional support for
development based on these resources.

Yiyo loo nto sivuya namhlanje xa uMphathiswa esixelela ukuba kukho abantu
abazizigidi ezine abahlala kufutshane nonxweme, izityebi, ooSambuntsuntsu
bezityebi, kwakunye nabo bahlwempuzeke ngeyona ndlela. Sibe novuyo ngale
ntsasa xa simva esithi iSebe lizimisele ukuyilungisa loo nto. (Translation
of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[That is why we are happy today when the hon the Minister tells us that
there are four million people staying along the coast, rich people at that,
whose wealth is immeasurable, as well as those who are very poor. We were
very happy this morning to hear that the Department is determined to
correct this anomaly.]

Policy and strategy in the form of sector development plans are required in
order to create the necessary framework and institutional support for
optimising the economic potential of the province's living marine
resources.

Xa ndigqibezela [In conclusion], we have no doubt that the challenges ahead
of us are both complex and immense, but we believe that the holistic
approach that we have adopted will work for the Eastern Cape. [Applause.]

Ms M METCALFE (Gauteng): Chairperson, I want to congratulate the Minister
on his budget speech. Gauteng will be supporting him.

We particularly want to congratulate him on the excellent work that he is
doing in tourism. That issue will be addressed by the other special
delegate from Gauteng, Sheila Weinberg.

The complexity of this portfolio makes it, I am sure, a very challenging
and interesting one for the Minister. There is a very complex set of issues
relating to the interdependency of tourism and the environment. He has
shown particular initiative and we want to congratulate him on the energy
that he has brought to this portfolio. As he has told the House today, he
has taken very active steps to extend to areas that are committed to
conservation in this country.

Recently I heard him say, and I think that he is completely correct, that
never in the history of this country has there been so much attention given
to extending the conservation status of land across the length and breadth
of the country.

With the support of the Deputy Minister, he has consistently taken our
commitments very seriously and entered into international protocols. This
has seen South Africa increasingly become a very important player and take
leadership positions in the debates, and international conventions and
structures that lead to those protocols.

We also want to congratulate him today on the launch of his White Paper for
Sustainable Coastal Development and for the principles that are contained
within that document. We need to balance stewardship and caring for our
very valuable and beautiful coastline with the opportunities and benefits
that those resources can bring in a socially responsible way.

The Minister is most famous, at the moment, for his war against the
national flower of the plastic bag. I will be talking a little bit more
about that later in my speech.

My main concern, and the subject that I will restrict myself to in my
comments in this debate, is the issue of the environment. This is
Environment Week; yesterday we celebrated World Environment Day.

I do not think that there is anyone in this House who needs to be reminded
that there are very serious consequences for our resources in terms of the
exploitative patterns of the past. Massive environmental degradation has
taken place across the length and breadth of the country, but particularly
in those areas where there has been mining, agricultural and industrial
activity. It has very serious consequences for all of us in terms of a
degraded and polluted environment and also in terms of the way that our
resources have been exploited and depleted.

The Minister faces several key challenges and those challenges, for me, can
be summarised in terms of how he takes forward our national and
constitutional commitments to sustainable development in a way in which we
mainstream that, so that the responsibility for sustainable development is
not seen as his alone or that of particularly related environmental
ministries.

Environmental concerns should be mainstreamed in our housing and health
policies and the development of infrastructure in our local governments,
thereby including all our parliamentarians, our chairpersons of portfolio
committees and everyone who participates in decision-making around the
development of infrastructure, so that they deeply understand the
environmental consequences of the decisions that they are taking. So the
first challenge to the Minister is to see that environmental concerns and
the viability of our country for the following generations are mainstreamed
across development in all Government portfolios.

The second area in which I believe that the Minister has enormous
responsibility - and people have spoken very eloquently about that today -
is in the field of educating the public about the importance of our
environmental commitments. Rev Moatshe spoke about a history of
dispossession and the reality that so many South Africans live in deeply
degraded environments, and where the opportunities to appreciate and enjoy
the beauty that we have all spoken about so eloquently is not the
experience of the majority of South Africans, but the experience of the
visitors that we bring to this country. It is our responsibility to
increase access so that people begin to understand much more meaningfully
what it is that we are cherishing in our conservation areas.

In Gauteng we have been working with the Gauteng Institute of Curriculum
Development to prepare learning materials for teachers and students in all
schools in Gauteng, to ensure that environmental education becomes a very
deep part of the curriculum experiences of children in Gauteng. I will be
returning to the issue of public understanding again and again in the other
issues that I raise.

The third responsibility, in addition to mainstreaming and educating, is
the responsibility that I believe that the Minister holds centrally in co-
ordinating intergovernmental and interministerial relations in terms of
environmental matters. We are all aware that the National Environmental
Management Act gave him the authority to establish the committee on
environmental co-ordination. I feel very strongly that the responsibility
that he must take in leading that committee is to ensure that the possible
existing fragmentation of environmental responsibilities across the
different affected Ministries is effectively managed by the person who
holds the portfolio responsible for the environment in this country.

Clearly those environmental responsibilities constitutionally cut across
both local, provincial and national government. But I am particularly
concerned about the environmental consequences of previous mining activity
in Gauteng. I am particularly concerned about the way in which dust
pollution and run-off water seriously affect the health and wellbeing of
citizens, often particularly the most disadvantaged and poorest people in
Gauteng.

It is clear that there has been inadequate rehabilitation of mining
activity in Gauteng over hundreds of years. This is causing erosion of the
rights of people in Gauteng, the erosion of their access to a safe and
healthy environment and, very seriously, degrades their living conditions.
We in the province are experiencing enormous pressure to use the National
Environmental Management Act and the provisions that it contains in defence
of the constitutional rights of people living in the province.

Clearly I am not comfortable in doing so. I would rather look to the
Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to ensure that we, indeed,
have a well-functioning system of co-operative governance so that, across
those Ministries that are responsible for environmental matters, there is
dedicated attention paid to such environmental degradation, and that the
leadership role that he plays spanning the different provinces is well co-
ordinated because, understandably, environment is a function that is
properly co-ordinated at national level.

This is also an issue that cuts across not only the Department of Minerals
and Energy, but also the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. Minister
Kasrils has been extraordinarily supportive of our province in the way in
which he has responded to environmental degradation that falls within the
responsibility of his portfolio. But today there has been a great deal of
discussion, and the Minister himself has raised the challenges of waste
management. I want to congratulate the Minister on the public initiative
that he has taken on the issue of raising public debate around waste
management, recycling and the way in which our consumerist behaviour is
contributing to pollution. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M OELRICH (Free State): Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, MECs
and hon members, it is indeed a pleasure for me to rise in this House
representing the province and, in particular, the ANC in our province. I
would appeal to the members of this House to grant me a moment's nostalgia.
My father stood in this House for a period of 20 years representing the
then United Party. For 16 of those years he was the leader of the Minority
Party in this House. I thank the House for granting me that moment of
nostalgia. [Applause.] [Interjections.] Let me add that my late father
fortunately did see our new democracy and he fully supported my venture
into the ANC. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Latest world tourism trends indicate a preference amongst tourists to meet
local people face to face. This trend is particularly exciting for the Free
State which has limited physical tourist attractions compared to South
Africa's coastal regions. On a recent visit to Europe, I was made very
aware of the fact that after being there for a week or two, when one is out
in the street all one would like to hear is somebody just saying; ``Hi!
It's great to have you here.'' That is how we Free Staters are.

It is a recognised fact in South Africa that the hospitality and warmth of
the Free State people have no equal and cannot be beaten. I would
particularly like to make reference to our hospitable farm folk, be they
workers or owners. I single out the Sesotho and Setswana-speaking Free
Staters in particular, who are known for their friendly and spontaneous
disposition.

Many urban inhabitants can testify to the pleasurable visits they have
enjoyed on Free State farms, whether they are from the ``beskawing''
[civilised places],  across the Hex River mountains, coastal dwellers or
miners returning to their ancestral environments, they are always made to
feel more than welcome.

Overseas visitors are being encouraged to become acquainted with township
life by visiting places such as Intabazwe in Harrismith, which shows off an
accurate presentation of day-to-day activities.

The previously mentioned aspects make our province ideal for hands-on
agritourism and meet-the-people tourism - this my own phraseology. This is
something that we have recently identified and instructed the Free State
tourism and marketing board to prioritise. We discourage bus drives through
townships, which only skims the surface of what the life is really like,
and without meeting the people, experiencing the heartbeat of the throbbing
environment on a personal level.

The marketing of the Free State to the rest of the world will increasingly
be left in the capable hands of Satour. We in the Free State would like to
extend our congratulations to Mr Valli Moosa on the quality appointments
made to the board of Satour. As a country and a province, we are competing
for tourists against other strong economies and democracies backed by
hundreds of years' experience in the industry. Although our six-year old
democracy is doing well and is striving to normalise the South African
society, we are still far from the ideal and the zenith of our goals.
During the second half of the twentieth century, when Europe was rebuilding
its infrastructure and creating wealth, we in South Africa had a government
which was hellbent on dividing our people and squandering the wealth
generated by inexpensively mined gold and diamonds, by maintaining 14
parliaments in order to keep up the artificial front. Politicians, however,
do not add value with their salaries, but tend to spend their money, and
when that dries up, they like to ask for more. To keep the suppressed
quiet, Pretoria kept on pouring more and more money into a bottomless pit
until the country had virtually bled dry.

In addition, the country got itself dragged into border conflicts under the
smoke screen cover of fighting communism.

That minority government controlled by a clique called the Broederbond were
only buying more time for themselves to govern at the expense of the
wellbeing of all South Africans and developing this country. European
countries did not ban communism as we had in South Africa. Instead, some
countries such as West Germany successfully built on nationalism and
communism to combine capitalism and socialism into a wealthy social welfare
state.

This background of a previously-divided South African nation is making it
difficult for us to normalise, adequately enough, our society into one
nation, which is essential if we are to make a success of people-to-people
tourism. Safe tourism means that all communities should be involved, take
responsibility and subsequently benefit. The Free State currently has too
many white product owners who are hesitant to bring on board new product
owners from traditionally disadvantaged communities. There are still too
many incidents of tourists being focused on as soft targets by the criminal
element. The recent horrendous attack on the Polish couple is such an
example, which we should all be decrying. It is only going to be when all
citizens are adequately educated about the advantages of the tourist trade
for each one of them that these attacks will stop.

Too many of our newly-established tourist forums have a life span of
approximately six months before intolerance sets in. Representatives stop
attending meetings, and eventually, the forums are steered only by white
members. To change the scenario, the Free State has established a link
between local government and tourism forums to build capacity and provide
accountability for funding and racial issues. These structures,  in turn,
link up to the provincial tourism department and the Free State tourism
marketing board, which in turn links to the national Tourism department and
Satour. This constant communication should limit the present costly
duplication taking place at those various spheres.

In conclusion, we need specialised actions to create a climate for tourism
because of the legacy of the past that divided our nation and sowed
mistrust among our people, to the extent that strangers and tourists are
not safe in our society. Farm attacks, rape and murder have become everyday
occurences. We as Government need to act just as vigorously against these
evils as we do in our campaign against HIV-Aids. Let us all motivate our
fellow citizens to reclaim the streets from criminals, the highways from
horrific evildoers.

Let us teach and educate our brothers and sisters that each tourist is not
only a potential job creator, but also an uplifter of our individuality as,
in the process of selling our country and our provinces, we ourselves are
enhanced by something greater than ourselves - our love and loyalty towards
the province and our beloved country. The Free State is determined to
address these challenges not next year, but today and now. How? Because we
have the support of a caring Government led by the ANC, a people's
government. The Free State supports the Minister in his endeavours to
promote tourism in South Africa. Finally, I invite all members to visit our
friendly, beautiful Free State. Come and experience our friendly, winning
smiles. [Applause.]

Ms M M KHUNWANA (North West): Chairperson, hon Minister, Chief Whip, MECs
from different provinces, NCOP members, chairpersons of the standing
committees, special delegates, I greet all members in the name of
democracy.

Tourism is a vital component of the North West province's economy, earning
an estimated income of R1,1 billion from 112 000 international tourists and
1 211 000 trips by local tourists as per the latest research undertaken by
Satour in 1995.

If these figures were correct, it would translate into approximately 10 120
direct jobs being created then. This is not visible due to the fact that
there is massive unemployment in our province. We are aware that statistics
are very poor in this field, a matter that is currently being vigorously
pursued by the national department. The department is also hoping to pursue
its own research programmes but is thwarted by the absence of resources to
undertake such exercises. It is estimated that tourism employs about 4% of
the workforce nationally, and has enormous potential to create
opportunities for the SMME sector, especially for the previously
disadvantaged communities.

The North West province is ranked very low in terms of the tourism receipts
in the country due the existing state of underdeveloped tourism attractions
and facilities. It has the potential to become very competitive within the
SADC region. To achieve this, the department of economic development and
tourism is working hard to implement the recently adopted North West
province tourism development strategy which was initiated by the MEC for
economic development and tourism, Mrs Edna Molewa, in conjunction with the
North West Parks and Tourism Board.

The key issues in this regard are aimed at job creation and empowerment of
the previously disenfranchised majority tourism and economic policy
implications for the province, investment towards tourism development, and
market and information analyses which should inform such developments.
Promoting tourism amongst the indigenous people in South Africa and in the
province is done in various ways. This, of course, also conforms to the
imperatives of the national White Paper on the Development and Promotion of
Tourism. It is also embodied in the North West policy document that this
industry will be government-led, private sector-driven and community-based.
A number of initiatives are currently being undertaken to ensure that the
previously disadvantaged will be acculturalised in this industry in the not
so distant future. This applies to their being hosts and entrepreneurs.

The North West also aligns itself with the current national Welcome
Campaign 2000, which is being spearheaded by the national department to
create an understanding amongst all South Africans of the importance of
tourism, encourage all South Africans to get involved in the industry,
encourage all South Africans to help and respect tourists and to encourage
all South Africans to respect the physical and social environment of the
country.

The department has established an SMME desk, whose primary task is to
assist our people to have a meaningful and rewarding involvement in this
industry. The department, together with its agency, the North West Parks
and Tourism Board, is looking at creating about 6 400 jobs in the next two
years, if circumstances permit. This, of course, will depend on various
factors such our access to the Poverty Relief Fund and the extent of
investment that will take place in the province.

A lot of effort is currently being expended to ensure that the province
will benefit adequately from the exposure that it will be getting through
professional marketing exercises including the Satour/private sector
partnership marketing strategy currently being implemented. However, the
province is also embarking on the process of establishing the Invest North
West institution whose mandate will be to cover both the tourism and
industrial investments and promotion.

As regards the water management programme, the North West province
subscribes to the principle that ``cleanliness is next to godliness''. It
also recognises some of the opportunities available for job creation
through waste management programmes. It should also be realised that whilst
this industry thrives on the environment in its various forms of
presentation, environmental management is a key factor for purposes of
preventing outbreaks of disease which can impact negatively on tourism
receipts once it hits the media.
It is also for these reasons that the North West supports the stance taken
by the national Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism to outlaw
some forms of plastic products that litter our environment. Needless to
say, it is very important to create the necessary awareness amongst the
rest of the South African population to be environmentally conscious. It is
known that some countries such as Germany does not encourage their citizens
to travel to those countries which do not take care of their environment,
and the North West cannot afford such adverse publicity.

The standing committee in the North West is particularly concerned about
medical waste management which is a medicolegal hazard in our province. We
wish this to be given serious consideration.

Tourism is a complex and cross-cutting sector which impacts on most other
economic sectors at different spatial levels and also affects various
sectors of society. Thus, in institutional terms, sustainable tourism
development requires a complete understanding of the range of functions
necessary across all spheres of government for the successful management of
the tourism system.
The national institutional framework for the management of the tourism
system on a financial basis also requires a lot of resources, both human
and financial. It is said that tourism as an economic activity is most
successful if managed by a partnership. We should also recognise that the
national tourism industry is underpinned by both the provinces and local
authorities, which are the pinnacles of the tourism industry in terms of
facilities and geographical attributes. This implies automatically that
integrated management, where resources are pooled together and plans
integrated matters. This cannot for any reason be underestimated. Once it
is accepted that the national structures hold the reins in terms of
national policy guidelines and the allocation of resources, it is also
imperative that this must be done in consultation with the grass-roots
authorities where things are happening. This will prevent parallel and ad
hoc developments that are brought about by poor consultation amongst the
three spheres of government.

It is for these reasons and others that there was a need to establish
cluster working groups, for the purpose of co-ordinating plans towards
maximising resource utilisation. This is strongly encouraged by the North
West Province government.

In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his environmental
campaign which is aimed at improving the lives of our people, and request
the Minister to continue as a revolutionary cadre to fight the
environmental cleanliness campaign to the advantage of the disadvantaged.
Therefore, the North West Province wishes to see and receive financial
support from the Minister to promote tourism in our province. [Time

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter, swak administrasie en bestuur het 'n direkte
invloed op mense se lewens en is veral sigbaar in die visbedryf.
Verskonings van te min geld en te min mense is nie meer geldig nie.
[Chairperson, poor administration and management have a direct impact on
people's lives and are especially visible in the fishing industry. Excuses
of a lack of money and too few people are no longer valid.]

It is no use having a so-called cheap government. At what cost?

Op die oomblik het ons ongeveer 55 heffings en belastings in die
Hoofdirektoraat: Mariene- en Kusbestuur, maar ons het nie die mense om dit
in te vorder nie. Wat help dit dus? [At the moment we have approximately 55
levies and taxes in the Chief Directorate: Marine and Coastal Management,
but we do not have the people to collect the money. Of what use is that?]

The best way to have effective streamlined administration is to have a
skills audit: What is needed? What have we got? For example, it has come to
my attention that, although MCM spent a total number of 2 000 hours on the
allocation on hake longline, MCM has no legal adviser. I am very glad to
hear that the Minister said that he was going for a high-power legal
entity. This post has been advertised but what is the salary of the person
going to be?

Ek gaan nie ten opsigte van salarisse die gesegde gebruik van ``peanuts''
en ``monkeys'' nie. Ek sal liewer die staaltjie gebruik wat ons in die
wynbedryf het. Iemand moes kies tussen twee bottels wyn. Hy besluit toe op
die goedkoper een, toe sê sy vriend vir hom: ``Jy sal proe wat jy nie
betaal het nie.'' Dieselfde geld vir hierdie departement.

Die direkte gevolge van swak administrasie en bestuur verwoes die
kusgemeenskappe, en ook nie net deur die toekenning van visvangregte nie.
Daar is byvoorbeeld die seewierkonsessies, die netvispermitte en die
sogenaamde ``subsistence fishermen''. Die seewierkonsessies het al in 1998
verval en daar is nog nie weer nuwes uitgereik nie, of dit is so onlangs
soos hierdie week uitgereik, maar ek is nie bewus daarvan nie. Die
netvispermitte is nou nog nie toegeken nie.

Dit bring my by die sogenaamde ``subsistence fishermen''. Ek het dokumente
en bewyse in my besit: sedert 21 Maart stuur ek name deur, kry ons vorms,
vul die mense in - die mense van Hawston, Langebaan ensovoorts ry en bring
vir ons vorms in. Daar gebeur niks nie en die seisoen het gesluit. So vir
sekere ``subsistence fishermen'' het dit wel gehelp, maar vir ander nie. Ek
wonder waar word die lyn getrek.

Dit bring my ook by die persoon wat verantwoordelik is vir die
``subsistence fishermen''. Volgens antwoorde aan my gegee in 'n vraag
gestel in hierdie Huis is daar tydelike aanstellings wat net intern
geadverteer is. Ek wil vandag die vraag vra: hoe het mnr Noel Williams, 'n
voormalige ANC-parlementslid, 'n pos in Seevisserye gekry as die pos net
intern geadverteer is? Die agb Minister kan verseker wees dat die DP hierop
sal ingaan.

Ek wil my vandag spesifiek bepaal by die hawens. Werkskepping is seker een
van die belangrikste doelwitte van die Regering. ``Job summits'' word gehou
en geld word afgetrek van mense se salarisse, maar as gevolg van swak
administrasie en bestuur gaan werk by die hawens verlore, veral aan die
Weskus - ek gaan grotendeels op die Weskus konsentreer. Die
vervangingswaarde van Suid-Afrika se hawens is verlede jaar bereken op R1
miljard en dit sluit die Portnet-hawens uit. Samsa het die naweek nog 'n
waarskuwing uitgereik dat hulle in die nuwe jaar geen lisensies of
veiligheidsertifikate gaan toeken aan bote wat nie op die sleephellings was
nie. Ons beskik nie op die oomblik oor sleephellings wat bedryf word nie.
Hoe lank gaan dit nog vat voor hulle in werking kom? In die besigheidsplan
wat die Minister vroeër die jaar aan ons gegee het, maak hy ons daarop
attent dat hy gaan konsentreer op ``public-private partnerships''.

Daar is egter ander goed waaraan ons intussen al kan aandag skenk, terwyl
ons ons voorberei op hierdie proses. Op die oomblik is die privaatsektor
besig om die sleephelling in Saldanhabaai op eie onkoste te herstel. Ek
dink dit is 'n skande vir die staat dat die privaatsektor voel, ter wille
van oorlewing, ter wille van werkskepping, ter wille van internasionale
ooreenkomste, moet hulle maar inspring en dit self regmaak. Presies 'n jaar
gelede het mnr Brown van die firma Boats getender om die sleephelling in
Saldanha teen 'n koste van R104 000 te herstel. Dit is van die hand gewys,
maar dan word daar R558 000 betaal aan 'n privaatspeurder vir 31 dae se
werk.

Wat betref St Helenabaai en Sandy Point, asook die daarmee gepaardgaande
werkskepping, verwys ek na Tully Marine, 'n voormalige pryswenner van die
Argus-Sanlam Job Creator of the Year 1998-toekenning, asook een van die
drie entrepreneurs van daardie jaar. In April vanjaar moes Tully Marine 40
van hul permanente geskoolde werkers afdank. Waarom? As gevolg van die feit
dat daar nie meer 'n sleephelling in St Helenabaai en by Sandy Point is
nie. Vyf jaar gelede het 80% van hul inkomste bestaan uit herstelwerk.
Vandag is dit minimaal. Dit is slegs 7% omdat daar nie 'n sleephelling is
nie. Die mense is op die oomblik besig om self 'n sleephelling te bou om
die bote wat hul bou net uit die fabriek in die water te kry. Hulle mag nie
bote van die water af inkry nie, want die staat het 'n sleephelling, maar
dit werk nie.

Dit bring my by die hawetariewe. In 1999 is die hawetariewe aangepas met
tot 4185%. Die verskoning is dat daar sedert 1993 geen tariewe gehef is
nie, maar wie se skuld is dit? Dit is swak administrasie en bestuur, maar
nou moet die gewone man daarvoor opdok. Wat meer is, die mense is bereid om
te betaal. Die gemiddelde inflasie oor die tydperk is deur kundiges bereken
op 72%. Hulle is bereid om dit te betaal, maar nie hierdie abnormale
verhoging nie.

Hierdie hawe kan hulle nie eens ten volle benut nie. Daar is een kaai wat
al twee jaar lank gesluit is. Een snoekkaai is al byna heeltemal verrot.
Derdens is die toegangsfooi by St Helenabaai abnormaal hoog. Daar is nie
eens ablusiegeriewe vir een mens nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Op die oomblik lê daar in St Helenabaai 'n boot van Lambertsbaai. Sy
herstelkoste beloop R60 000. Sy hawetariewe vir die maand beloop R88 000.
Hierdie mense kry nie eens kwotas nie. Hoe moet hulle hul bote regmaak?
[Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is 'n skande.

Dan is daar ook nog die driedubbele heffing op die herstel van buitelandse
bote. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[With regard to salaries, I am not going to use the saying of ``peanuts''
and ``monkeys''. I would rather make use of the analogy we have in the wine
industry. Somebody had to choose between two bottles of wine. When he
decided on the cheaper one, his friend said to him: ``You will taste what
you did not pay for.'' The same applies to this department.

The direct consequences of poor administration and management are
destroying the coastal communities, and not only through the allocation of
fishing rights. There are, for example, the concessions for seaweed, the
netting permits and the so-called subsistence fishermen. The concessions
for seaweed expired in 1998 and new ones have not yet been issued, or they
have been issued as recently as this week, but I am not aware of that
having happened. The netting permits have still not been allocated.

This brings me to the so-called subsistence fishermen. I have proof and
documents in my possession: since 21 March I have sent names through,
acquired forms, filled in by the people - the people of Hawston, Langebaan,
and so forth, went and brought us forms. Nothing has happened and the
season has come to an end. Thus, certain subsistence fishermen did benefit,
whilst others did not. I wonder where the line is drawn.

This also brings me to the person responsible for the subsistence
fishermen. In response to a question I had asked in this House I was given
the reply that there were temporary appointments which were only advertised
internally. Today I want to ask the question: How did Mr Noel Williams, a
former ANC member, acquire a post in Sea Fisheries if that post was only
advertised internally? The hon the Minister can be sure of the fact that
the DP will investigate the matter.

Today I especially want to focus on ports. Job creation is certainly one of
the most important aims of the Government. Job summits are held and money
is deducted from people's salaries, but due to poor administration and
management, jobs at ports are being lost, especially on the West Coast - I
am mainly going to focus on the West Coast. The replacement value of South
Africa's ports was calculated at R1 billion last year and this excluded the
Portnet harbours. Samsa issued another warning this weekend that in the new
year they will not be issuing any licences or safety certificates to boats
that were not on the slipways. At present we do not have operational
slipways. How long will it still be before they are operational? In the
business plan that the Minister gave us earlier this year, he drew our
attention to the fact that he will focus on public-private partnerships.

However, there are other matters to which we can in the meantime devote our
attention, while we prepare ourselves for this process. At the moment the
private sector is busy repairing the slipway at Saldanha Bay at its own
expense. I think it is a disgrace for the state that the private sector
feels that, for the sake of survival, job creation and international
agreements, they have to jump in themselves and repair it.

Precisely a year ago Mr Brown of the firm Boats put in a tender to repair
the slipway at Saldanha at a cost of R104 000. It was refused, but then a
private investigator was paid R558 000 for 31 days' work.

With regard to St Helena Bay and Sandy Point, together with the concomitant
job creation, I want to refer to Tully Marine, a former prize-winner of the
Argus-Sanlam Job Creator of the Year 1998 award, as well as one of the
three entrepreneurs of that year. In April this year Tully Marine had to
dismiss 40 of their permanent skilled workers. Why? Owing to the fact that
there are no longer slipways at St Helena Bay and at Sandy Point. Five
years ago 80% of their income consisted of repairs. Today that is minimal.
It is only 7%, because there is no slipway. At present the people are busy
building a slipway themselves, just to get the boats which they are
building out of the factory and into the water. They are not allowed to get
boats out of the water and onto dry land, because the state has a slipway,
but it is not working.

This brings me to port tariffs. In 1999 port tariffs were adjusted by as
much as 4185%. The excuse was that since 1993 no tariffs were imposed, but
whose fault is that? That is poor administration and management, but now
the man in the street has to foot the bill. What is more, the people are
prepared to pay. The average inflation over that period has been calculated
by experts at 72%. They are prepared to pay, but not this abnormal
increase.

They cannot even utilise this port fully. There is one quay that has been
closed for two years now. One snoek quay has already almost rotted away.
Thirdly, the entrance fee at St Helena Bay is abnormally high. There are
not even ablution facilities for a single person. [Interjections.]

At the moment a boat from Lamberts Bay is lying at anchor at St Helena Bay.
Its repair costs amount to R60 000. Its port tariffs amount to R88 000 for
the month. These people do not even get quotas. How must they repair their
boats? [Interjections.] It is a disgrace.

Then there is also the triple levy on the repair of foreign boats.]

I am not going to take a question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! On what point
of order are you rising, hon member?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,
are you prepared to take a question?

Mrs A M VERSVELD: No, I am absolutely not prepared to do so. If I get four
extra minutes, I will take a question.

Dan is daar ook nog driedubbele heffings op die herstel van buitelandse
bote asook R2 000 per dag om aan die kaai te lê. Die gevolg hiervan is dat
die buitelandse bote nie meer by ons hawens aandoen nie. Ons verloor baie
belangrike buitelandse valuta en meer nog, ons verloor werkgeleenthede.

Dit is nie die enigste probleme nie. Daar is ook probleme met die grond,
want mense in St Helenabaai kan die grond net vyf jaar lank huur. Ons
vriend mnr Dickie Meter in Houtbaai kan egter met die goedkeuring van die
Houtbaai-ontwikkelingstrust 25 jaar lank grond huur waarop daar nog geen
investering gedoen is nie.

Ek besef ek nader die einde van my spreektyd, en ek sluit graag af.

[Then there is also the triple levy on the repair of foreign boats, as well
as R2 000 per day to be anchored at the quay. The result of this is that
the foreign boats do not call at our ports any more. We are losing very
important foreign exchange and what is more, we are losing job
opportunities.

These are not the only problems. There are also problems with land, because
people in St Helena Bay can only rent land for five years. Our friend Mr
Dickie Meter in Hout Bay can, however, with the approval of the Hout Bay
Development Trust, rent land for 25 years, on which no investment has been
done yet.

I realise that I am nearing the end of my speaking time, and I would like
to conclude.]

I gave a notice of motion this morning to the effect that the integrity of
this House is at stake. The seriousness with which I view this issue will
be reflected in the letters to the Chairperson and the Chief Whip, which I
will send to them through the Table. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, hon Minister and Deputy Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism, members of this august House, special
delegates from provinces and MECs present here today, I am privileged to,
once again, address this House, particularly on this occasion of the policy
review debate on Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

The purpose of my address will be to set out some of the key areas,
particularly in the field of tourism, that this department will have to
grapple with much more seriously, and how this should relate to the broader
issues of tourism as a creator of sustainable jobs in the economy and the
largest foreign currency earner.

As we emerge from the pariah state that South Africa had become through
successive gangster regimes that had blindly defended the morally repugnant
system of apartheid, we are now confidently and proudly into the second
term of our democratic order, ably led by the glorious army of the majority
of the people of this country, the ANC. This has brought with it increased
societal awareness of the strategic importance of tourism, although it is
not the panacea for all the social ills in our country.

The question should therefore be asked whether we have, indeed, done enough
as a nation to unlock the tremendous potential that tourism has for South
Africa in relation to the all-important matter of job creation, thus
dealing with some of the social ills in our country, particularly the
colossal unemployment and abject poverty which I referred to earlier on.

Our ability, therefore, to effectively unlock this potential depends, to a
very large extent, on our ability to have a shared patriotism, commitment
and a shared vision in terms of how we want to turn this industry into
South Africa's single biggest creator of jobs in the economy to benefit the
most vulnerable in society, particularly women in rural communities and
young people.

This industry must deliberately create an entrepreneurial class of young
men and women who must, in turn, contribute to the development of a vibrant
SMME sector to provide much-needed jobs for school-leavers and first-time
job seekers in the country. It should therefore not be seen as a sole
preserve or exclusive domain of the historically advantaged - who still are
in this position - and its business and its professional class.

It must be said that the collective minds of those that planned and
defended apartheid colonialism for decades in this country must now be used
progressively to unlock and promote the tourism industry in South Africa on
an unprecedented scale to eliminate poverty and thus create a better life
for all. It is through all of us genuinely confronting these realities that
we can boldly declare, as young people do, that yesterday is, indeed, a
foreign country, and that tomorrow belongs to us all.

Having said that, I must also point out that tourism, as a source of job
creation, should be Government's priority in view of the sector's potential
for foreign currency earnings and employment, as I indicated earlier on. It
must also be borne in mind that it is this sector that has a substantial
flow-through effect which touches all sectors of the economy. It has a
great potential as a catalyst for future economic and social development
throughout our SADC region.

All our people, particularly the majority on whose behalf I speak in this
Chamber, must benefit from the much-talked-about ``world's greatest tourist
attractions'' which South Africa boasts, with regard to both the natural
and the cultural heritage, ranging from game parks and pristine scenery to
beaches and traditional villages. We should make it possible for low-income
earners to marvel with pride at the beauty of these attractions, while
equally engaging the unemployed in this sector, using it as a launching pad
for economic development, particularly among rural communities.

Tourism development's major preoccupation should, therefore, be to raise
the wellbeing of local communities, to promote mutual understanding in
order to achieve peace, to conserve nature and the environment, and to
preserve traditions as well as the social and cultural values of our
country. The interests of local people must, therefore, be taken care of so
that a peaceful atmosphere within which tourism can thrive can then
prevail.

If South Africa attracts 0,2% of the annual estimated 300 million tourists
in the world - and we rank number 42 when it comes to tourism earners in
the world - then we need to do much more in the area of marketing our
precious country. We need to have the best marketing strategies, through
partnerships with the private sector, so that we can become serious world
players in world tourism.

Our ability to achieve all of these things also depends on the capacity of
provinces to market their various attractions among local people and to
build local economies. Local government, being the confluence of delivery,
must then begin to find, in a much more concrete way, innovative strategies
for creating a local tourism corps to develop tourism-related products at a
local level. In this way we will be able to showcase certain attractions at
a local level and bring the richness of the history to tourists and thus
effectively create sustainable jobs locally and provide local authorities
with much-needed revenue. This tourism corps must also become the first
line of defence for tourists against criminal elements in areas where these
elements are to be found.

If the number of jobs in the trade, catering and accommodation sectors of
the economy grew by 9% last year as a result of growth in tourism and if
tourism currently brings an estimated R20 billion a year into the economy,
second only to mining and manufacturing in its contribution to the GDP,
then with our renewed determination, commitment and energy, we could
effectively be in a position to double if not treble the statistics.

As South Africans, we must again do what we are capable of doing, and that
is to give tourists a friendly smile when they visit this country. We
should stop and talk to them whenever we meet them. We should be positive
about our cultures, our country and its future, and be proud of our
facilities, keep our environment litter-free and say no to plastic bags. We
should also be able to talk about these cultures, our customs and say a big
no to crime, and above all, be proud of being South African.

The Minister has touched on a number of critical areas, which I feel I must
also comment on, in relation to the whole issue of us as Government
creating strategic partnerships with the private sector. A case in point
relates to SAA's recent global partnership with Delta airlines which
promises to bring an additional 26 000 visitors per year to South Africa.
This view was reinforced by the Minister in his most recent address at the
Indaba 2000 travel showcase, which this industry holds almost annually,
where the Minister spoke of the strategic importance of all of us working
as a nation to make South Africa one of the hottest destinations on the
globe. If this is the approach of the Minister, there honestly is not even
a shade of doubt in my mind that this industry is going through its own
renaissance. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, colleagues
in the Council, it is a pleasure for me to participate in this policy
debate on Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

The hon the Deputy Minister is not only a finger-wagging Deputy Minister,
but has also become a fist-wagging Deputy Minister in today's editorial of
the Business Day. She must keep it up! [Laughter.] As my colleague Mrs
Cronjé indicated to the House, I will focus on environmental issues. She
has touched on some of the tourism issues. However, I must also state that
some of the issues that I am going to touch on have been discussed at
Minmec, but I thought it would be wise for me to share some of the
information with my colleagues here in this honourable Council of ours.

I do not know if it was an act of omission, and I would like to think that
it was so, where, on the last page of the hon the Minister's speech which I
have just read, he referred to the celebration which he had with the
province of Gauteng with regard to the Sterkfontein caves. I must remind
the hon the Minister that we also celebrated the declaration of the Greater
St Lucia Wetland park as a World Heritage site with him, and I am sure that
it was an omission. We are also looking forward to the declaration of the
Drakensberg-Ukhalamba range as having World Heritage status for both the
cultural and natural beauty that it offers.

I just want to make a few remarks on tourism. I was delighted to learn, a
few days ago, that the Global Environment Facility, via the World Bank, has
approved a loan or grant totalling some R15 million which will go towards a
project to protect the exceptional biodiversity of the Maluti-Drakensberg
mountains through conservation-sustainable resource use and land use, and
development planning. I think what is exciting about this particular
project, as the hon Minister indicated to us, is that it is not only South
Africa and three provinces within South Africa that are involved in this
project, but that it also involves the neighbouring country of Lesotho. I
am sure that the national department will do everything that it has to do
to ensure that we get this particular loan.

My colleague Mrs Cronjé spoke about tourism, and others spoke about some of
the factors that would negatively influence tourism in our country.
However, I would also like for us to remember that poor waste management
will also impact negatively on visitors' experiences and, consequently,
damage the image that tourism marketing campaigns endeavour to project of
South Africa as an international destination. I will be reflecting on waste
management later on. However, since this is Environment  Week and we
celebrated World Environment Day yesterday, I am very pleased that the
national department and the Minister and Deputy Minister have taken the
opportunity to extend the awareness campaign for ten days, and not only
celebrate and make people aware on World Environment Day.

Now, we have various challenges that we face in KwaZulu-Natal, and I
thought I would share some of these challenges with hon members. Land
fertility is declining. Land degradation is increasing. The rapid growth of
urbanisation is causing massive air pollution. Marine fisheries are being
overexploited to the point that their ability to quickly recover is in
doubt. Wetlands are under considerable pressure as a result of
predominantly agricultural and commercial forestry development. When it
comes to industrial development, although monitoring seems to indicate that
there are no major problems with air quality in areas of complex
development, I believe there is considerable public concern about air
pollution from industries operating in the province, and I will refer to
this a little later as well.

I would like to say to members of this Council, that as the department of
environmental affairs in KwaZulu-Natal, we have  engaged in various
activities over the last few days, some of which have been visits to
schools and conducting environmental awareness campaigns - the eradication
of alien plants within and outside school premises and the planting of
indigenous trees -  and the propagation and planting of medicinal plants
with traditional healers. We promoted an anti-litter campaign involving
local communities and schools. We had live talk shows, and it was a
pleasure for me to participate in a talk show with the hon Deputy Minister
last night. We have encouraged art competitions aimed at learners and
adults, and we offered cash prizes and awarded prizes for the best
functional art and best visual art entries using waste materials. So these
are just some of the activities that we have engaged in in the province.

Turning to waste management and environmental affairs, I would like to
discuss the responsibility that we as provinces have in this sphere of
environmental affairs, especially in respect of pollution control. The
Constitution provides for the right of the individual to live in a clean
and healthy environment. Natural law probably confers the same right on him
or her. The Constitution also clearly provides that protection of the
environment should be a concurrent responsibility of national and
provincial Government. It is a basic responsibility that neither sphere of
Government can shirk. We have to decide where the division of
responsibilities should lie, which functions of protecting the environment
are most effectively provided by which sphere of government, and here I
refer to the three spheres of Government that we have. I believe that
everything has to mesh at the end of the day, whether it is the provincial
government, or the local government that carries out the functions.
Everything has to mesh with the national framework of standards and
procedures.

We also have to decide how such functions are to be funded. As I said, the
Constitution places on Government the responsibility for environmental
care, but the Constitution does not provide the funding for the task.

We in Government have a serious mandate which is inadequately funded. I
think that is true of both spheres of government, national and provincial.
We simply do not have the trained personnel, and I think the Northern
Province referred to that. We simply do not have the trained personnel in
sufficient numbers, nor the budgets, to provide the environmental
protection mandated to us by the Constitution. We cannot allow this kind of
scenario to continue.
KwaZulu-Natal has been giving attention to this anomaly. We take seriously,
as I am sure other colleagues would, the responsibilities toward the
environment and human society. Early in April we organised a workshop in
Durban to discuss the responsibility of various spheres of government,
national, provincial and local. We were delighted that there were
colleagues of ours from five other provinces present at this workshop,
where we engaged in a full-day workshop to try to fathom from the National
Environmental Management Act what exactly our responsibilities are.

The report has been given to the hon the Minister, and I am sure that the
national department will take this forward so that there is clarity on who
has to do what and when. To this end we are concerned about the levels of
pollution, particularly in the Southern Durban area, and I want to thank
the hon the Minister and the Deputy Minister for the proactive steps that
they have taken to come to the province to try to sort out this problem.

Unfortunately what does tend to happen is that, because my portfolio title
is ``MEC for Environmental Affairs'', the first port of call is my office.
So, I think here again we have to sort out, particularly when it comes to
disasters, who goes in and acts. I would like to think that any sphere of
government which is available at that moment when there is a disaster,
should be able to act, as we did when it came to a sulphur dioxide leak at
one of the factories recently. We had problems there. We instituted a
committee which investigated the matter.

I am looking forward to the investigating committee on the polythene
chlorine leaks as well. I understand that a panel has been put together,
and I hope that this investigation can start soon, because the hon the
Minister did indicate publicly that there would be an investigation into
this matter. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G C ADAMS (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister, colleagues and members of this House, it is an honour for me to
be here today to address this House in the debate on the national policy
review.

Before I start I would like to say that I met with the Minister yesterday
at a clean-up project, and I spoke to him about funding a project in the
Western Cape that is very dear to my heart. He was quite agreeable about
it. What happened was that I then had to go back and redraft my speech. So,
my speech today, if anything, is well considered. [Laughter.]

Yesterday was World Environment Day. It is thus fitting that the budget
debate on the environmental portfolio should be held today, because the
Unep theme for this year is: ``The Environment Millennium, Time to Act''.
One's will to act is evidenced by one's will to spend. In this instance it
is taxpayers' money we are spending. The question that therefore arises is
not only how much we are prepared to commit, but also whether that
expenditure is effective.

It is correct to target poverty alleviation and job creation as priority
goals in the environmental budget, but what must also be recognised is the
role that privileged people play in our society in the generation of waste
and pollution. Almost inevitably, although it is not the intention, poor
people get the blame for our environmental woes. The sooner poverty
alleviation is linked to the causes of waste pollution, and the consumption
of resources through privilege, the more balanced the budgetary approach
will be. In other words, the causes of poverty and the causes of
environmental degradation must be linked, not the results.

The expenditure on the development of an integrated waste management
strategy must be fast-tracked, and not be held hostage by the popular
issues in the environmental budget. By this I mean that the Minister has
gained himself superhero status with his intention to combat plastic bags
as litter. I agree with him, and will give 100% support to his initiatives,
but the problem must be seen for what it is. It is a litter problem along
with all the filth and litter we encounter. Whilst the plastic bag issue
merits the national priority that it is enjoying, one can similarly wage a
war on paper products, cans, glass and tyres. An integrated waste
management strategy is needed wherein plastic bags, all the other litter
problems, and incentive-linked recycling projects must be situated and be
accorded relative priority. We cannot wait two or three years to implement
an integrated national waste management policy.

I turn to the issue of 4x4 vehicles, and note the Minister's public
statement in this regard. Whilst I feel just as strongly about 4x4 vehicles
on our beaches as he does, I think that this matter has to be reconsidered.
Instead of 4x4 vehicles being banned from the beaches, beaches should be
graded according to their sensitivity and the impact the projected volume
of 4x4 vehicles would have on that area. In some instances, one might opt
for controlled access, and in others, no access whatsoever by 4x4 vehicles.
A total ban is too blunt an instrument. [Interjections.]
I fully endorse the hon the Minister's stance on industrial pollution. I
agree that there is rampant lawlessness amongst industrial operators who
pollute without regard. They tend to have the public relations machinery to
sanitise their public image whilst their pollution affects the health of
our children and degrades our environment. The sooner the regulations he is
drafting sees the light of day, the better off we will be.

Related to this is the ubiquitous foreign investor. Whenever any decision
is made on the environment, we are threatened that we will scare away one
or other foreign investor. Whilst I acknowledge the importance of foreign
investment, we cannot be held hostage to their demands, nor can we allow
ourselves to become the dumping ground of their capital expenditure.
Investment must be conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner,
otherwise it will migrate anyway, but only after it has wreaked havoc in
our land.

I am further pleased to see the Minister's support for local agenda 21
coming through and I trust with each successive budget more resources can
be allocated to our obligations on agenda 21 issues. So, too, must our
international obligations on biodiversity, climate change, transport of
hazardous goods, nuclear waste, etc, be monitored and implemented.

Now I am done with the compliments. If ever there was a blot on the
Minister's fine record in his portfolio up to now - and I say up to now,
because I was encouraged by his words this morning - then it must be the
fishing industry. It is time that the Minister concedes failure in the
current marine resources management system and redesigns it. We in the
Western Cape, where nearly 90% of the industry is concentrated, had the ear
of the role-players, and can see that the present system is profoundly
dysfunctional.

When one sees flagship empowerment initiatives being boasted about on the
SABC news, and knows that a family member was a member of the Fisheries
Transformation Council, then one does not need a private investigator to
tell one that nepotism is rife. When the Deputy Minister stands up in
Parliament and declares that the private investigator found nothing wrong,
and a few days later one reads that the same private investigator is
threatening to go public and uncover compromising information, then the
system is seriously and profoundly corrupt. [Interjections.]

Look at the so-called transformation in the industry which is almost
synonymous with an old cronies club. Very poor and desperate people are
suffering because the ruling party is keen to dish out patronage. This is
wrong. Please bring an end to it. If Minister Kader Asmal can rethink
Curriculum 2005, then the Minister can redesign the quota system. Perhaps
it is time to consider sharing the responsibility of marine and coastal
management with the other spheres of government.

Finally, environmentalists understand the difficulties that are inherent in
this portfolio. The Minister has done much to raise the profile of
sustainable environmental management in this country. The challenge will be
to see whether the legacy of this new approach will be one that meets the
profile.

The Minister and I share a common vision. We will work together to realise
this vision, but we will agree to differ over issues where the environment
is used as a political football. The environmental challenges facing us are
much bigger than the politics of the day. Let us not lose sight of the
bigger picture. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Thank you, hon
member. You have perhaps set a good example. When we allocate time, it does
not mean that you must exhaust it. [Laughter.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Mr Chair, Minister and the House at large, section 24(a) of
our Constitution provides that every person has the right to an environment
that is not harmful to their health or wellbeing. Flowing from that
provision, I would like to share with the Minister and this House a few
observations connected to the environmental problems I have experienced in
the Northern Province.
We have a problem with the state of disrepair of the security fences along
the Kruger National Park. These fences are commonly known there as ``10
heights''. The problems related to these are as follows: Firstly, these
fences are very dilapidated. Wild animals and predators often leave the
park and enter villages, causing problems and destroying livestock. A month
ago, we had a terrible situation. Seven lions, along with one cheetah and
one buffalo escaped from the Kruger National Park. Later on, these lions
were tracked down and four were shot dead. Three are still at large along
with the cheetah and the buffalo. One other shocking experience in that
area is that a certain gentleman called Judas Baloyi was knocked down by a
buffalo and became unconscious, and he eventually recovered in hospital.

I am just trying to indicate to the Minister the problems that we
experience in the unfriendly environment in that particular area. The state
of affairs is definitely not pleasing in that particular area, and is
mainly due to the fencing which is quite loose. This might not fall within
the competency of the Minister, but I think it is worth mentioning because
it is connected to the environment.

One other observation about a problem is that the environment there becomes
so unfriendly that some people lose livestock. Hence, I would like to know
from the Minister if there is an intention to establish a compensation
policy because a lot of the livestock in those areas serve as a means of
income for the rural people there. I know of a lot of youths that have gone
to universities and technikons because of the fact that their parents
reared livestock, and this is very important.
One other observation that I wish to make is that, especially at the
ranches where people come to see the animals and some come for professional
hunting purposes, and there is a pile of stores and goods that are going to
waste. For example, at the Letaba ranch, we have hides and skins that were
left there by the former homeland governments which are piling up and
rotting. These could be sold and this money could go into the government
coffers.

We also have equipment, machinery and other items in those areas. They are
lying there unused. I would request that, if this particular matter falls
within the competency of the Minister, it should please receive very urgent
attention.

It is a pity that, in most cases, I do not have much time. I always have
only four minutes. Otherwise, I could have told him more stories about
baboons and other things that are moving around there that are creating an
unfriendly environment in those areas. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Thank you, we
will hear more about baboons later. [Laughter.]
The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chair, hon
members and delegates, I think as responsible political leaders of this
country, we must put the citizens first on our agendas and make positive
contributions to their lives, because we feel that cheap politicking or
vote-touting make no positive contribution to our people. It is usually
those who have no programmes or anything to offer to our people who try to
distract us from the real visions and real and noble cause of this new
democratic Government.

It is our people who suffered in the past and, even now, are being made to
suffer in a very subtle way. The communities are getting confused and we
should please not rub salt on the open wounds that are there. We definitely
would like to focus on assisting our people and making a difference in
their lives, and what we hear, we will take as noise pollution and nothing
else. [Laughter.]

To make some comments on what has been said, it is true that certain
harbours have been repaired by private businesses. That is true. The
businesses offered to do so and, anyway, the deputy director-general is on
his way to thank them. They offered to do it, and it is good. We are
working in partnership with business and civil society, and there is
nothing wrong with that. We have now budgeted R10 million to repair those
harbours.

Coming to Noel Williams, he was appointed within the legal parameters. We
can go on investigating, but we do not have the time. We want to deliver to
our people. [Interjections.]

With regard to harbour fees, we have had a meeting. We have discussed this,
and we have said that the people who are involved in fishing must come and
tell us about it. We are waiting for them to bring their proposals and we
are going to sit down with them. In fact, those harbour fees were set by
those hon members' government because they were in government. I think we
must not waste our time. [Interjections.] Please listen to what we want to
do. We are acting on those plans.

This year, the theme of World Environment Week has a clear message that it
is time to act and clean up our country to create a better life. Our
country is getting dirtier every day and our people's lives are endangered.
Our environment is degraded by ill-managed and hazardous waste, and our
children are in constant danger of contracting diseases. Because of air
pollution, as a world, we are faced with the real possibility of global
warming and similar dangers emanating from atmospheric changes, and our
enormous coastline is threatened by irresponsible human behaviour. We have
resolved to get a foothold on all these issues through clear policies and
firm action in order to entrench the principles of sustainable development
geared towards the improvement of our people's quality of life.

To do this, an integrated strategy is indispensable. A forum such as the
NCOP, that brings all the spheres of government together, is tasked with a
role that can make or break our endeavours to carry this vision forward. If
provinces and local governments do not localise and implement these
policies that we have set out here, those policies remain meaningless to
the poor majority we purport to serve.

Pollution and waste management issues are foremost on our agenda. Just two
weeks ago, we unveiled the White Paper on Integrated Pollution and Waste
Management for SA. We are determined to turn this policy into reality. To
this end, we have published, for public comment, regulations that spell out
our intention to ban the use of plastic carrier bags. Let me hasten to say
that the ban is not on all plastics, but we will only ban the thin carrier
bags that have 79 microns or less that are given free of charge in all the
supermarkets, and that are always visible in our country's landscape.
Everyone uses plastic, and therefore we strongly believe that this issue
will help us reach every South African and encourage a culture of
cleanliness.

Visible action is being taken to establish waste management infrastructure
in townships dealing with medical waste - this is what was raised by the
hon member from the North West who was worried about medical waste. We had
a lot of incidents even in the Western Cape and all over the country, and
we need to deal with it, and other hazardous waste which continues to
threaten our communities and is contributing to increased poverty and the
degradation of the environment.

To this end, in August this year, we will be publishing guidelines for
integrated waste management planning for local government. Local government
has a key role to play in the community awareness campaigns, the designing
of alternative collection systems and the creation of community-based waste
collection systems.

It is the role of local government to put in place local by-laws,
ordinances and regulations that are effective. It is appropriate to
acknowledge the steps taken by the Northern Cape town of Douglas, as has
already been mentioned, of banning plastic carrier bags well ahead of this
becoming law. Last weekend some shops in Pretoria also announced to their
customers and to the communities that, as from next month, they would not
be using any plastic bags; people must bring their own carrier bags. We are
proud of these initiatives. The city of Cape Town will also soon be
launching a huge campaign against litter in the Mother City. This is the
type of initiative we expect from local government if we are to succeed in
defeating the scourge of waste that threatens to drown us all.

The state of health care waste management in South Africa is very poor.
Contributing to this state of affairs is a lack of training and awareness,
and limited financial resources, particularly at the provincial health care
level. Add to this the lack of capacity at authority level, and one has a
situation where the disposal of health care waste to inappropriate
landfills and informal dumps becomes commonplace in our country.

Whilst some institutions are managing infectious waste in an unacceptable
manner, almost none has acceptable procedures and management systems in
place for chemical, including pharmaceutical, waste and low-level
radioactive waste. A brief study into the current status of health care
waste management, the approach used internationally and the needs in South
Africa has been conducted by our department. We will shortly be publishing
regulations that will serve as guidelines for health care waste management
to correct this scary situation.

Over the past few months, concern has been expressed about air pollution.
Some corporate citizens have been less than responsible in their commitment
to limit emission levels to acceptable and hazard-free levels.

Government, on its side, has been consistent over the past six years in
enforcing sustained emission reduction programmes at each of the four
refineries in our country. We are confident that this will result in
significant improvement in ambient air pollution levels in the vicinity of
these plants. In fact, the results of our independently audited monitoring
reveals that the emission levels which residents are exposed to are well
below the standards of the World Health Organisation. However, we are still
concerned that these levels have not yet been reached everywhere, because
communities are still suffering in these areas. We are determined to
continue monitoring this.

The hon member Mr Van Niekerk is indeed correct in saying that littering is
a crime. In fact, people in some areas have already implemented certain
initiatives. The other day I launched a buy-back centre in Thohoyandou.
There the youth have volunteered to enforce this. They wore T-shirts with
the words ``littering is a crime''. There are initiatives that we do not
know about. We encourage people to go on with this. Littering really is a
crime.

Despite these improvements, Government is committed to heed the calls of
our people who have, over the years, moved closer to sites near refineries
and in some instances, of course, the refineries were built near them. We
have stated, on a number of occasions, that we have no tolerance for
companies that harm the health of residents and workers through their
activities. We will not hesitate to prosecute and recover damages from
companies that disregard environmental norms and standards.

We have agreed to start negotiations with the refineries on putting in
place co-operative agreements in terms of the National Environmental
Management Act, which will entail the operation of ambient and emission
monitoring, independent auditing of monitoring results and agreeing on
emission reduction programmes. These negotiations do not preclude more
drastic action against the major pollutors in this country, we will still
prosecute them. Polluters will be made to pay to clean up their mess. They
will have to pay for all the expenses incurred by the communities.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Could the hon
the Deputy Minister wrap up?

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Yes.

Internationally we are playing our part in these areas. South Africa has
been mandated to host the Basel Regional Training Centre on behalf of the
English speaking countries, which is intended to build capacity in
hazardous waste management and the transboundary movement of waste.
We are well aware of the problems of asbestos. The case will be heard in
London on 19 June and we are all supporting this. We must definitely all do
this.

Concerning climate change, we in South Africa have joined a convention on
climate change to get a solution to the escalating greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere. Because South Africa's economy is coal
based, we will still have problems in this regard. We need alternatives in
our townships to supply electricity or alternative means of energy.

This morning we launched the White Paper for Sustainable Coastal
Development in South Africa. It comes at a very good time, because this
week we celebrate World Environment Week.

It is estimated that these resources contribute R168 billion annually to
the national economy, approximately 35% of the gross domestic product. The
coastal population of approximately 13,7 million people includes some of
South Africa's poorest and most overcrowded communities. It is our
challenge as politicians to assist those communities. They must have access
to our resources, but they must know how to conserve and take care of these
coastal areas so as not to degrade them continuously.

This policy is aimed at maximising and sustaining the social, economic and
environmental benefits provided by coastal resources. In a partnership
between Government and civil society, the department will initiate a course
of action that will unlock the full potential of our coast whilst
maintaining the wealth, diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems.

Central to this strategy is support for local demonstration projects aimed
at fostering shared responsibility of coastal resources between Government
and coastal communities. Certain communities are joining the Blue Flag
campaign. This means that that particular community is able to keep the
coast clean. Communities which achieve this, will get a Blue Flag. All
coastal communities must strive to do that. Durban is the first recipient
of the Blue Flag, and I am proud of that. All communities, right up to here
in the Western Cape, should join.

With the help of this White Paper, we can establish ``one-stop-shops'' for
obtaining planning, environmental and other approvals for coastal
development applications. We need to support these ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon Deputy
Minister, you are three minutes over your time.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: All right.

All these initiatives are challenges to all of us here as political leaders
and we need to take them seriously. [Applause.]

Ms S WEINBERG (Gauteng): Chairperson, I would like to make some
introductory remarks just to say that it is a real honour for me to be
speaking in the NCOP. I fought long and hard for the struggle to be here.
[Applause.]

Gauteng is the most industrialised province in this country and contributes
at least 39% of the GDP. Being industrialised, the generation of waste is
greatest in our province of all provinces. We are accordingly extremely
enthusiastic about the national waste management strategy and were
encouraged by the recently released White Paper. We look forward to the
regulations mentioned by the Deputy Minister. We wish great strength to the
elbows of the department.

There is much criticism out there of this ANC-led Government, and much
praise, praise for the way in which we have formulated plans, strategies
and White Papers. Here we have the best minds in the world, creative
thinkers, people experienced in the ways of the world. The question and
problem we are now faced with in the second five years of government is
simply how to implement these wonderful plans. The critics are waiting for
us to fail, but they will wait in vain.

The Gauteng provincial government is committed to implementing the national
waste management strategy in order to make a decisive difference to the
lives of ordinary people in our province. People should not have to live
near rubbish heaps where they are exposed to the effluent of mining and
industrial operations. We see the enforcement of environmental protection
regulations as a prime priority of the province. We are aware of who the
polluters are and are determined to make them pay for the disaster they are
creating.
With regard to medical waste, which is a major problem when children
playing in the vicinity of household rubbish dumps are found with used
syringes and other immensely dangerous medical waste, the Gauteng
provincial government has embarked on a process of education and
consultation which will arrive at a sustainable medical waste management
system. We are confident that the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism will take the role as lead agent on pollution management with
dedication and verve, and will co-ordinate other departments in the drive
for a clean and safe world for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.

When it comes to tourism, we are proud to acknowledge that the Gauteng
Tourism Authority, established in terms of our provincial legislation, has
been launched. Recently passed regulations will allow for the registration
and levying of all accommodation facilities, and an estimated R2,5 million
will be raised. We are well on track with sophisticated computer software
to undertake the registration and marketing of all tourism facilities, from
the lowliest community tourist guide to the largest hotel.

We acknowledge that Gauteng does not have the oceans, mountains and major
wilderness areas of other provinces. So we see ourselves as a conference
and convention destination, with opportunities for emerging operators in
day tours to interesting places. Soweto, for instance, is the 10th most
visited destination in South Africa. Also, tourists are interested in our
struggle for liberation, and places of interest such as Alexandra township,
where ex-President Mandela stayed when he first came to Johannesburg, and
the homes of the likes of Alfred Nzo, Wally Serote and many others from our
liberation struggle whose roots are in Alexandra, will become part of our
tourist product. We also boast, as has been mentioned, a World Heritage
site known as the Cradle of Humankind.

However, before Alexandra and other townships and, indeed, the country as a
whole can become a serious mass tourist destination, there is much that
must be cleaned up. I refer not only to waste management and plastic bags,
which are the challenges I have already mentioned, but also to tourism
safety, to be achieved in conjunction with the SA Police Service and, more
importantly, the challenge of beginning to turn around the perceptions
which people hold about South Africa, and Gauteng in particular, as a
dangerous place to come to. Gauteng is no more dangerous than London, Rome
or New York for tourists.

The price of the rand in relation to the dollar and the pound sterling
certainly makes our country an attractive destination, even for budget
tourists and backpackers. However, we do call on the private sector to
avoid the temptation of greed, and to set their prices at a level which is
also accessible for local tourists, and, hence, encourage the overall
growth of the industry. What we and Government need to do now is to create
an industry that is coherent, service-oriented, clean and bright.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I have to say to the Minister that I have been
highly impressed, and I hope he has too, by the high standard of speeches
that we have heard here today. It really encourages one for the future. I
want to say to the Minister that we too wish to be responsible and wise
custodians of our God-given environment. We wish to promote policy that
meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability
of future generations to meet those needs, that is, the principle of
sustainability.

We need not only a vision that is shared and pursued by all inhabitants of
all the provinces, but also a vision which is understood and supported at
every level of society. How do we achieve these lofty goals? Unless
ordinary people buy into the lofty intentions we have, there is not going
to be sustainable environmental protection. We feel the shortcoming on the
development agenda is that we are dealing with functional and physical
considerations only, and that we are ignoring too much in a real sense the
norms, values and ethics which should underpin and uphold our environment.

Having identified and agreed on these norms, values and ethical standards
where possible, we need to link them to the Constitution. Two of these
values are democratic representivity and the inclusion of the individual,
the community and the local area in the planning process and
sustainability. Through effective communication and education, we need to
disseminate those shared norms and values to the whole nation so that
everybody can identify with them, because if they do not seek to do that
and feel that these things have no meaning, value or relevance to them,
they will become alienated and the environment will become an object of
envy.
Finally, the public benefit of good environmental management needs to be
understood by everybody, the public and the Government alike. Tourism is a
wonderful thing, but if it is to be promoted and encouraged - and I
congratulate the Minister on what he is doing in outsourcing and
privatising as these are wonderful things - we cannot have a new apartheid
between hard-currency visitors, who come to wonder at our pristine and
natural areas, and those of us in our own country who are left out because
they cannot afford access to that environment. I am echoing what several of
our colleagues, such as Ms Metcalf and others, have said.

We, all of us, must not become commercially excluded in our own country. A
balance has to be struck and access ensured for all South Africans. Access
is absolutely vital. We also need to find together those norms, values and
ethics that should underlie our wish to preserve and conserve our
environment for all our people. So we need to identify with what we find -
the norms and values that we find together - to communicate, to educate,
and finally, to experience our environment, and understand and feel the
benefits of the wild stewardship that the God-given environment brings.

Finally, may I say to the Minister - and I do not want to be flippant about
this - that if he and his colleagues can halve the crime rate, they will
double the tourism intake in this country. [Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, hon Ministers and Deputy Minister, hon MECs, hon
members and special delegates, section 24 of the Constitution guarantees
that everyone has the right to an environment that is not harmful to their
health or wellbeing;  and also to have the environment protected, for the
benefit of present and future generations, through reasonable legislative
and other measures that prevent pollution and ecological degradation,
promote conservation, and secure ecologically sustainable development and
use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social
development.

The benefit of environmental conservation of our natural resources, trees
being one of them, is invaluable. The value of trees is often
underestimated. Apart form the fact that trees supply our timber and fire
wood needs, trees enrich our environment, therefore they need to be
conserved.

The progress in industrial development is degrading the quality of life,
and the productive capacity of the environment will soon run into
bankruptcy. Humanity needs a sense of kinship between people and nature,
and there is a moral responsibility to protect the environment from abuse.
Economically speaking, we need to utilise our tree resources on a
sustainable basis on the one hand. On the other hand, there is a social and
moral decay that is crippling.

Although preserving trees is important because of their economic value,
their ecological value is not always fully appreciated. Trees release an
enormous amount of oxygen which is responsible for our human survival. The
leaves of trees filter dust from the air, thus creating a healthy
environment. The careless neglect and destruction of trees may result in an
as yet unknown risk or damage to the quality of human life. Their
photosynthesis properties benefit not only humans, but animals, birds and
insects. Fruits and nuts borne by the trees provide food for these species,
while flowers produce nectar and pollen, from which bees make honey. This
preserves animal species by providing not only food but a habitat as well.

Within and enclosed in the crown of a tree, a beneficial microclimate is
created where birds and insects are protected from the extremes of weather
and climate. These micro-organisms, such as insects, also need to be
protected. They are just as important to human welfare as the black rhino,
and also play an important role in the ecosystem. The issue is not that we
should preserve certain species like the rhino, the issue is that we should
preserve life-giving ecosystems and, in this sense, a rhino is not more
important than a bird or an insect.

Soil erosion is another problem that threatens our environment. Every year
millions of tons of soil are washed or blown away from the farmlands of
South Africa. With the world population doubling every 40 years soil will
become an even more crucial resource for the provision of food and homes.
As pressure on soil resources increases it becomes vitally important that
the existing resources are correctly and efficiently used.

The best soil is completely exposed to rain drops and the scouring of
running water. Soil cover intercepts this energy and dissipates it before
it reaches the ground. Old tree leaves which fall to the ground protect the
soil from erosion, and provide cover and food for many small animals and
insects. The humus improves the texture and fertility of the soil, stores
moisture and makes it easier for water to enter the soil. The roots of
trees can help to hold the soil together, thus reducing erosion. Roots
penetrate deeply into the soil and the underlying rock, opening channels
for air and water and also promoting the formation of new soil.

The effects of erosion are long-lasting and more serious than is often
imagined. The removal of topsoil leaves behind the less productive subsoil
layers. Soil nutrients are washed away and this results in reduced and low-
quality yields. Eroded soil may contain pesticides which can pollute
streams and smother estuarine and lake ecosystems. The washed-away sediment
settles in dams and lakes, thus reducing their capacity to carry water,
resulting in flooding.

Trees also act as windbreaks, thus reducing the effects of wind erosion and
damage. We therefore need an increasing awareness of the enormity of the
effects of wind and water erosion. We must also become aware that the
purpose of conservation is the protection of resources to serve humanity.
Although a resource is not always directly measurable in monetary terms,
its function does, however, possess a particular value in an ecosystem. A
sustainable tourist industry is measured through its conservation of the
environment.

In conclusion, we must instil in the minds and hearts of people that
conservation is not something that is carried out by the Government in a
nature reserve, for example, but can happen in our back yards. [Time
expired] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, I would
like to express my gratitude to all those who participated in this debate.
It is quite clear that a tremendous amount of preparation has gone into
this debate, and I really enjoyed listening to everybody. I think that
there was quite a lot for all of us to learn. I have taken note very
carefully of the comments that everybody has made. May I assure you,
Chairperson, that we will sift through the large number of suggestions that
have been made in the debate here and all of them will receive our serious
attention.

As I do not want to keep members from their lunch I will not respond to
every detail of what many of the speakers have said. However, because of
the time I should perhaps just then say to the Chairperson that we have
received very good co-operation generally from the select committee under
the leadership of Rev Moatshe. I would like to use this opportunity to
express my appreciation for the manner in which we have worked together,
and for the support that he has given both the Ministry and the department.
I hope that we will continue along these lines for the rest of the year.
[Applause.]

I want to use this opportunity to express my gratitude for and give my
congratulations to the Northern Cape province, particularly the people of
Douglas, on having taken their own initiative to stop the use of plastic
bags in their town. That is an initiative that they have taken on their
own. Nobody has given them the funding to do it. They did not ask anybody
for permission to do it. The community, on their own, decided to do this,
and I think it sets a wonderful example for the rest of South Africa.
[Applause.] I hope that we will be able to use that as a way of challenging
towns and cities and the rest of the country to follow the same example.
The only final point then which I would like to make is that a number of
people have spoken about the need for us to mainstream the environment and
environmental issues in this country. Members will know that much of what
we do, much of the philosophy and the direction that we follow on
environmental questions flow out of Agenda 21, which really is the product
of the Earth Summit which was held in Rio in 1992. It was only after the
1992 Earth Summit in Rio that a range of international protocols were
entered into. Members will know, for example, that recently negotiations
around a biosafety protocol, which regulates GMOs and other sorts of
things, were concluded successfully. The Rio Earth Summit really produced
what was a comprehensive agenda for the global community to follow on
environmental questions, such as CSD questions related to climate change
and global warming, matters related to local governance - all of those
things.

The next earth summit, referred to loosely as ``Rio plus 10'', takes place
in 2002, which is 10 years from the Rio summit, and is convened by the
United Nations itself, as members know. The United Nations General Assembly
will take a decision pretty soon on where that earth summit is to be held.
I thought we should use this opportunity to inform Parliament that Cabinet
has decided that South Africa will make itself available to host ``Rio
plus 10'', in other words, the next earth summit. [Applause.]

We are reasonably confident that we will be chosen as the venue for a whole
range of reasons, which I am not going to go into here. Many countries
around the world have indicated that in their view we would be the ideal
host for the earth summit.

The magnitude and significance of that summit are difficult to actually go
into in a few minutes. However, one can expect that it will be attended by
scores of heads of state, that it will be attended by literally tens of
thousands of delegates from around the world, and that there will be a
string of satellite summits of all sorts that will be associated with that
summit. When we get to know, in a month or two, whether we will be hosting
it, we would like to involve Parliament, the provinces and, in
particularly, local governments in a massive effort to ensure not only that
South Africa is used as a venue, but that the mere fact of the earth summit
being held here leaves a lasting impact on South Africa and on
environmental questions in this country, in the region and certainly in
Africa also. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of Policy)

Vote No 35 - Welfare:

The MINISTER FOR WELFARE AND POPULATION DEVELOPMENT: Hon Chairperson of the
NCOP, hon members, representatives of the welfare community, distinguished
guests, comrades and friends, I am pleased to present the Budget Vote of
the Department of Welfare and Population Development to the National
Council of Provinces. In making this Budget speech, I would like to
reiterate a statement made by President Mbeki during his opening address to
Parliament in February this year. He stated that whereas in the past
suffering and degradation were the only things that were certain in the
lives of millions of our people, hope has now taken the place of despair.

In my Budget Vote speech today I wish to focus on the steps that the
national department and provincial governments have taken in the field of
social welfare and development to ensure that hope takes the place of
despair.

When I introduced the Welfare debate in the National Assembly on 18 April I
indicated that during the first period of democratic government the
foundations were laid for a restructuring of the welfare system. My
predecessor led the introduction of significant policy and legislative
changes within the framework of the Constitution and the Reconstruction and
Development Programme. The White Paper on Social Welfare as well as a
number of other policies provide examples of policy changes in social
welfare since 1994.

The fact that there have been sweeping changes that have touched the lives
of millions of people in our country is unquestionable, but touching the
lives of the poorest of the poor is not enough. As Government, and
especially as the Department of Welfare, we have to ensure that the way we
work at national, provincial and local levels does not lead to the
alienation and further marginalisation of the most vulnerable sectors of
our communities.

How do we transform our approaches, our welfare systems, our work
behaviour, and organise our departments at national and provincial levels
to begin to make a real difference to the people who matter? How do we
ensure that we do not squeeze out care, the invisible heart of human
development and social transformation, in the way we work?

To do this we have to understand our constitutional mandate as well as our
relationship with provincial governments. Moreover, we need to translate
the principle of co-operative governance into reality so that there is
clarity on what people can expect of us as we attempt to respond to their
needs. Today I will share with hon members how we are giving effect to
this.

Within the policy and legislative environment that has been established to
deal with the legacy of apartheid and social welfare provisions, we are, at
both national and provincial level, required to implement national
legislation, and policy and programme initiatives to address poverty,
social disintegration and other persistent social problems and ills.

The national department is obliged to assist each provincial welfare
department to understand the legislative and programme imperatives that
drive the work of the Government. To do this, we have undertaken to work
together, all of us, both at national and provincial levels, to implement a
10-point programme that has come out of national and provincial processes
of engagement with people and organisations of civil society.

The members of the council of Welfare Ministers are, like me,  new entrants
in the welfare field in this term of government.  However, let me add that
we are not new to the issues of poverty we are grappling with. We are
working together, with me as an invaluable and crucial link to those we
serve.

In our engagement on the wide-ranging problems that need to be dealt with
to provide an effective welfare and development service, the council of
Welfare Ministers is challenged to, firstly, implement the 10-point plan in
a strategic programme of action within the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework and provincial budget allocations. Secondly, their task is to
identify the blocks in the way of the implementation of welfare services
and to devise ways of addressing these. Thirdly, they must monitor the
implementation of the programmes and the performance of provincial welfare
departments in fulfilling constitutional obligations and reaching
performance targets. Fourthly, they must mobilise action with our
stakeholders, civil society organisations and the welfare sector to
accelerate social delivery to those most at risk and in need. Fifthly, they
must support the implementation of the national Government's priorities,
undertake such corrective measures as may be required to deal with the
backlogs in welfare services, and function as a forum for collective
executive decision-making on related matters.

I have visited almost all the provinces, with the exception of the Northern
Cape, to gain an understanding of the state of welfare, and monitor what is
happening. My MECs have joined me in my visits and meetings to expose some
of the problems and to find ways to address these.

We are determined that systematic attempts be made to root out
inefficiency, corruption and indifference. In this we are all united. We
may not be able to see the type of changes that we want as quickly as is
needed, but let me assure hon members that we must and will change the way
we work in welfare and development.

These are not just promises. As hon members are aware, during the debate on
the Poverty Relief Programme on 9 March in the NCOP, I detailed the many
problems that had bedevilled the programme. Today I would like to report on
the actions we have taken to bring the principles of human development and
social protection into welfare practice.

We continue to implement an integrated poverty eradication strategy that
provides direct benefits to those who are in greatest need within a
sustainable development approach. During the past year we supported 1 933
projects in provinces and 15 national programmes. These projects assisted
approximately 11 197 women, 2 904 men, and 2 055 youths and disabled
persons. Detailed information on the projects that have received funds is
available on the Department of Welfare's website. This can be found at
www.welfare.gov.za.

Corrective measures have been instituted to deal with problems related to
the initial delays in the disbursement of welfare and poverty relief funds.
These measures include, firstly, a financial audit of the poverty relief
disbursements made in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years. Secondly,
the responsibilities and roles of national and provincial departments have
been clarified. In the Minmec we have established a committee, which I
chair, to ensure the alignment of all projects with programme objectives.
Provinces have been assigned a larger role in project selection, and the
national department will be responsible for co-ordinating the monitoring
and evaluation of the programme. Accountability structures with detailed
guidelines are being established for all sectors.

In addition, we have established a partnership with a number of faith-based
organisations and NGOs working in the area of poverty relief. Based on
these consultations, guidelines are being drawn up on ways of improving the
programme management processes in the poverty relief fund.

The role of the Independent Development Trust, or IDT, as a disbursement
agency has been invaluable in the poverty relief programme. Its
disbursement role will be enhanced to encompass a monitoring and capacity-
building function. This monitoring and evaluation will include a central
role for the NGO and faith-based sectors.

These protocols need to have acceptable guidelines for the selection of
projects, disbursement procedures, financial and professional
accountability and evaluation. We will ensure that national and provincial
departments of welfare have the requisite procedures and systems for
effective financial control, management, monitoring and accountability.

Further initiatives, as part of the integrated poverty eradication
strategy, include the community empowerment programmes currently being
piloted in the North West province. Plans are under way to extend this
programme to Mpumalanga. The main aim of this programme is to build
community capacity to plan and manage a range of locally-based development
initiatives.

The micro-save programme in KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Province and the
Eastern Cape, as part of the Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development
Strategy, is being improved. These programmes aim to strengthen the stokvel-
type savings collectives to promote a culture of saving and the economic
viability of microenterprises for poor households, and especially for
women. We have forged new partnerships with organisations such as People's
Dialogue and appreciate the technical support provided by the United
Nations Development Programme and the International Labour Organisation in
these programmes.

I would like to address the issue of social security. A key policy
objective of our social security system is to provide social assistance to
those citizens who are not able to provide for themselves. The social
assistance programme provides benefits to approximately 3 million of the
most vulnerable people in our society, namely older persons, persons with
disabilities, and children under the age of seven years.

The intake roll of the child support grant has increased from 36 000 in
April 1999 to 334 000 in March 2000. This represents an increase of almost
1 000%. In seven of the provinces the re-registration process is almost
complete. This process is designed to clean the database and eliminate
fraud from the system.

The South African Constitution grants everyone the right to have access to
social security and appropriate social assistance for those individuals who
are unable to support themselves. It also obliges the state to implement
measures to ensure the progressive realisation of these rights. Cabinet has
therefore established a committee of investigation into social security.
This committee will make a proposal on how we develop a comprehensive
social security system that links contributory and noncontributory schemes
and prioritises the most vulnerable households. The Department of Welfare
is leading this critical process.

An important part of its brief includes an investigation into the extension
of social protection to the working poor, unwaged workers and all those
currently not covered by any form of assistance. Furthermore, it has been
charged with the task of working on the proposal from the Jobs Summit for a
basic income grant, or what I prefer to call a development grant.

The committee has already held two meeetings to take forward its brief. It
has met with both national and international experts in the field of social
security and has worked out a detailed plan on how it will involve the
provinces, civil society, Government departments and relevant stakeholders,
including workers' organisations and business in its deliberations.

A progress report on what has been done by this committee thus far will be
given to me in the next two weeks. I will ensure that the provinces and
this House get the report as soon as possible. Since the committee's work
has major significance for us, as we attempt to promote national interests
and provide for the poorest people, we will ensure that the process is
thorough and comprehensive. As such, the work of the committee will be
conducted over a period of at least 12 to 18 months and will involve
vigorous investigation, debate and proposals based on South African
realities.

A new welfare payment and information service is also being established to
improve the operational efficiency of the welfare system. However, all
these initiatives need to be supported by appropriate infrastructural
development at provincial level to ensure that pensioners do not suffer in
long queues.

Another issue of concern is the increase in the number of litigation cases
against the provinces with regard to their implementation of the
regulations of the Social Assistance Act of 1992. We are actively working
with the provinces to ensure that this situation is addressed speedily.

We have strengthened programmes to respond to the brutal effects of all
forms of violence against women and children and older persons. The
department has established 60 one-stop service centres through which abused
women and children can receive assistance. The high level of abuse against
elderly persons is unacceptable and is being urgently addressed. The
committee of inquiry into the abuse of the elderly which was established at
the end of March 2000 will be submitting its report by September. The
committee has visited traditional leaders in the Northern Province, the
North West and the Eastern Cape to secure their support. Provincial visits
and public hearings have been held in the Free State, the Northern Cape and
the Eastern Cape.

Negotiations with the Minister of Safety and Security are under way to
ensure the protection of older persons when they receive their pension
payments. The free reign that criminals and loan sharks have had to harass
and intimidate older persons on pension payment days will soon come to an
end. A national audit of the physical infrastructure used for the
disbursement of welfare grant payments is being commissioned. The
infrastructure and associated working conditions make it extremely
difficult for staff to render an efficient service.

Discussions with the Minister of Health to ensure the provision of adequate
first aid and medical services for older persons, when they go to receive
their pension payments, are also to be held.

Urgent attention has been given to the development of a national strategy
to reduce the number of young people in trouble with the law and to promote
youth development. Our prevention and remedial services for youth have
sought to accelerate the transformation of the youth and child care system
to ensure that our interventions are developmental. We have introduced 15
child and youth care service projects in 8 provinces with development
assistance from the Netherlands government. One of these projects,
``Stepping Stones'' in the Eastern Cape, won an award for innovative
service delivery. The Netherlands government recommended that it should
become an international learning site. I wish to congratulate those
involved in this project in the provincial department of welfare in the
Eastern Cape. These projects have provided best-practice models for ongoing
work in this field.

While the national and provincial departments are concerned about the
increasing number of children in prisons and police cells, most provinces
are in the process of establishing secure care facilities that meet the
specified minimum requirements. I would like to single out two provinces.
The Northern Cape now has two secure care centres - one in Kimberley and
the other in Upington. The Free State is exploring the feasibility of
combining its exemplary secure care facilities with a one-stop youth
justice centre.

The most critical aspect of our work with young people is our response to
one of the fastest growing incidence of HIV-Aids in the world. Our response
to the HIV-Aids epidemic requires that we confront the denial, fear and
stigmatisation associated with the disease. All of this is not possible
without greater involvement from people living with and/or affected by HIV-
Aids. One of the challenges for the Department of Welfare is to create an
enabling and supportive environment for children infected and affected by
HIV-Aids. A particular challenge is to ensure the rights and development of
Aids orphans.

We have engaged in extensive consultation with the provinces and have
collectively drawn up a national integrated plan for children infected and
affected by HIV-Aids. The plan is a joint venture and is an effort between
the departments of Welfare, Education and Health. In order to accelerate
the implementation of the plan, the departments of Welfare and Health have
held a joint Minmec meeting to assess the most effective ways of supporting
community and home-based care. The Government has allocated an amount of R6
million to Welfare for this programme over the next year. The child
protection week campaign which took place between 28 May and 3 June 2000
under the leadership of the Department of Welfare has once again served to
ensure that this issue remains in the public spotlight.

It is very significant that, for the first time in our nation's history, we
have also been able to spearhead and implement an Angolan solidarity
programme. We are committed to mobilising the people of South Africa to
provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Angola. This year, as we
celebrate and commemorate the International Day of the Child, National
Youth Day and Child Abuse Prevention Week, we will be highlighting the
linkages to the Angola solidarity programme. An interdepartmental committee
for solidarity with Angola has been in place since February and has been
responsible for organising the Angola Focus weeks, which ran from 15 May to
30 May 2000. The public response has been overwhelming and encouraging.
Many organisations and individuals have made contributions and many more
are still coming forward. Contributions have been received from faith-based
organisations, provinces, individuals and the business sector. Even
prisoners from Cullinan have donated shoes for Angolan victims of war. Let
me take this opportunity to thank all those that have contributed to this
campaign. Nangamso ningadinwa. [Do the same to other people as well.] I
make a heartfelt appeal to all our people: People should support the Angola
appeal fund.

The disaster relief fund has processed applications for assistance due to
various floods, tornadoes, and veldfires across the country. We are
committed to making social welfare services accessible and available to
people in rural, periurban and informal settlements. Ensuring equity in
service provision is critical to the caring society that we are trying to
build. I am therefore pleased to report that, with respect to access and
coverage, our service provision is increasingly reaching the poorest
members of our communities. There is a significant shift away from a race-
based welfare system to one that is needs-based, but racism and inequities
will take some time to overcome.
I would like to conclude this Budget Vote speech by reiterating our
commitment to co-operative governance. The MECs for social welfare in the
provinces, and the full range of civil society organisations, including
voluntary, welfare and faith-based organisations, have been working with me
and my department to find practical solutions to their problems. I commend
their commitment to addressing the needs of the poorest of the poor and I
am sure that, together, we can develop a process based on accountability,
responsiveness, efficiency and equity.

We have been working on a number of fronts to change the welfare system. I
have only dealt with a few in my speech to the House today. Can we say that
we are reinventing the system by bringing care, the invisible heart of
human development, into the system? I hope so. Let us work together so that
hope can take the place of despair.

I would like to take this opportunity also to thank the Department of
Welfare, the director-general and all the management concerned in the work
that they have done who have been able to help me achieve what has been put
in front of me by the people of South Africa. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Comrade Chairperson, comrade Minister, hon MECs, special
delegates and members, I am once more honoured to have been given an
opportunity to participate in this very important debate that affects the
livelihood of millions of our people.

For the purposes of this debate, the select committee identified the
following areas of concern that affect our respective provinces in one way
or another. The first one is management and administration of social grants
and the question of fraud and corruption management, both of which I will
deal with together; the second is the question of the integration of the
welfare services; the third is poverty alleviation; and the fourth is the
impact of HIV-Aids on the welfare system.
The Department of Welfare and Population Development was one of the
Government departments that in the past, was always characterised by fraud
and corruption and ghost beneficiaries, and many a time there were reports
of grants and pensions lining the pockets of nondeserving clients. All of
us, including the Minister himself, can testify to having heard reports of
beneficiaries who draw more than one grant or pension, either in the same
province or in different provinces. This has led to deserving beneficiaries
not being able to access state grants or pensions, and some of our senior
citizens passing on, after having worked their whole lives, without having
had the benefit of an old age pension.

The process of reregistration launched in July 1997 was aimed at cleaning
up the database of beneficiaries and ensuring that pensions and grants get
to the most vulnerable, that is the aged, the disabled, women and children.


We were told at a recent select committee meeting that the process of
reregistration was 80% complete and that by the end of this month, which is
June, it would be 100% complete. May I say that we will hold the department
to this commitment and that we will visit our welfare departments in the
different provinces during our next constituency period in order to
ascertain whether this has, in fact, happened.

The issue of cash-in-transit heists, particularly involving pension moneys,
which have been taking place in the Eastern Cape, calls for a serious
investigation and close co-operation between the Department of Welfare and
the Department of Safety and Security, both provincially and nationally.
The culprits, whoever they are and wherever they might be, must be found
and brought to book. It is unacceptable that money earmarked for the most
vulnerable members of our society gets plundered by heartless criminals and
corrupt elements in our communities.

Regarding the integration of welfare services, the 1999-2000 annual report
of the department highlights the following areas of focus: Firstly, human
resource development, secondly, human resource management and, thirdly,
strategic planning and business repositioning. In the same annual report,
mention is made of the reorientation of social services workers' courses.
This, indeed, is good news for all of us. It is in line with the
Government's programme to create a more effective public service in order
to meet the priorities of social service delivery and realise the concept
of Batho Pele. This programme was kickstarted in three provinces, namely
KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and the Northern Province, and I hope by now it
has been extended to the remaining six provinces.

I just want to refer briefly here to the Gauteng Citizens' Charter which
was launched in around 1997 or 1998. The citizens' charter, says:


  We, the Department of Welfare and Population Development, declare to the
  citizens of Gauteng that we as the department shall actively work towards
  a better quality of life for all. At the outset, we want to place the
  social welfare and population development at the cutting edge of
  combating poverty that affects a large sector of our people. We declare
  that social welfare is a critical tool that complements the RDP and the
  macroeconomic strategy to effectively address socioeconomic problems
  faced by our people.

It goes on and lists eight commitments that the department makes to the
citizens of Gauteng.

In the area of human resource management, the question of job evaluation
and performance management is critical. As a department that delivers an
important service to our community, we cannot afford to employ people who
are not sensitive to the needs of our people. Far too many reports have
reached us in our constituencies about the uncaring attitude of welfare
public servants for us to ignore this matter. So, it is appropriate that
the Minister has targeted performance management as a priority.

Regarding the question of poverty alleviation, a lot has already been said
about the campaign of declaring war against poverty. We had, not so long
ago, a snap debate in this House where some very pertinent questions were
posed to the Minister and his department. I am sure that the MECs and the
special delegates present here will raise additional questions around the
issue of poverty alleviation as it pertains to their respective provinces.
The Minister has also alluded to the programmes and projects that are
funded in this regard.

Two weeks ago, we as members of the Select Committee on Social Services and
the Portfolio Committee on Welfare of the National Assembly, visited three
farms in the Phillippi area. The conditions that these farmworkers and
their families live under are, to say the least, appalling. Some earn as
little as R18 a week. They spend the very same R18 at the shop owned by the
farmer on the premises. Simple calculations indicate that one cannot even
buy a loaf of bread for each day of the week with this R18. So, these
workers continue to be oppressed despite our democracy and despite the
programmes specifically geared towards alleviating poverty.

The Departments of Welfare, Health and Agriculture and Land Affairs should
work together towards the provision of subsistence food security for these
farmworkers and their families. Food security is not only about food
production, but also about access to adequate, affordable and safe food. I
am sure I do not have to stress the importance of good nutrition,
especially for children during their cognitive developmental years. A way
must be found to improve the quality of life of some of these farmworkers,
particularly in the rural areas.

We also have to embark on an evaluation process whereby flagship programmes
or projects in the different provinces can be audited and evaluated to
ensure that they fulfil the objectives of sustainable development and job
creation.

Regarding the question of the impact of HIV-Aids on our welfare system,
according to the department's annual report of 1999-2000, we have an
estimated 1 600 new HIV infections occurring daily. The Department of
Welfare will probably be the hardest hit by this epidemic, since, together
with the Department of Health, it will have to care and provide resources
for children orphaned by Aids and adults suffering from the disease. The
Minister has already referred to plans in the department in this regard.

The provision of services to support community-based care will also have a
profound effect on the welfare budget in the long term. The establishment
of the SA National Aids Council and the inclusion of Ministers of Welfare,
Health, Finance, Labour, Education and others goes a long way in developing
an interdepartmental machinery in order to lessen the impact of the blow of
HIV-Aids on the financial and human resources of our country.

In conclusion, the Department of Welfare has a huge responsibility to
redress the backlogs left by the apartheid legacy. It cannot afford to have
insufficient human resources to fulfil this obligation, because if the
department cannot deliver, we know that somewhere a potential beneficiary
will suffer and may even die. I want to urge the Minister to ensure that
the key finance posts within the department are filled expeditiously and,
thereafter, all the other managerial posts, in order to ensure more
efficient and effective delivery to our people.

I want to thank the Minister and his team for interacting with us this
afternoon, and I am sure that together we will continue to make the needs
of the most vulnerable people our priority, thereby creating a better life
for all our people. [Applause.]

Mr V R P SKHOSANA (Gauteng): Chairperson, Comrade Minister, fellow MECs and
members, it is indeed a great privilege for me to participate in this
Budget Review. In his state of the nation address on 24 May 1994, former
President Nelson Mandela said, and I quote:


  My Government's commitment to create a people-centred society of liberty
  binds us to the pursuit of the goals of freedom from want, freedom from
  hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from
  suppression and freedom from fear. These freedoms are fundamental to the
  guarantee of human dignity. They will therefore constitute part of the
  centrepiece of what this Government will seek to achieve, the focal point
  on which our attention will continuously be focused ...
  We must address the needs of the aged and disabled, uplift disadvantaged
  sectors such as the women and the youth, and improve the lives of our
  people in the rural communities and the informal settlements ...


  We must combat such social pathologies as widespread poverty, the
  breakdown of family life, crime, alcohol and drug abuse, the abuse of
  children, women and the elderly and the painful reality of street
  children.

Although we have achieved much in the past five years, we still need to do
more to reverse poverty and social disintegration in our society. Our
province, which is a microcosm of our country,  is still characterised by
the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. Distribution of
wealth and income is among the most unequal. The poorest 40% of households
receive 11% and the richest 10% receive more than 40% of the total income.
It is these realities that led to the Minister of Welfare, Dr Zola
Skweyiya, stating that, and I quote:


  South Africa has been, and is experiencing a deep social crisis. This
  crisis has the potential to reverse the democratic gains made since 1994.
  The disintegration of the social fabric of family and community life is a
  reality that has to be acknowledged at a fundamental level.

We aim to meet this challenge and others posed by President Mbeki in his
call for a caring society by focusing on the following priorities. The
first priority is the rebuilding of family, community and social life. The
objective of social welfare is to promote the wellbeing of individuals,
families and communities. Welfare services are part of the broad menu of
social services rendered by various departments, which aim to enhance the
quality of life of citizens and which provide an enabling environment for
children, youth, women, families and older persons to achieve their
aspirations.
We are involved in initiatives to ensure the transformation of social
services within a developmental framework, including a policy on
developmental social welfare services, a new welfare financing policy and a
developmental quality assurance management instrument. In attending to
these programmes we as a province believe that it is important that the
following key principles are adhered to, namely the principles of
empowerment, continuity of care and development, restorative justice and
family preservation.

On the integration of a poverty eradication strategy, our approach to
welfare and development is amply described in the phrase ``war against
poverty''. This approach requires a strong investment to ensure that an
integrated process of human and community capacity-building takes place to
fight poverty and promote social integration. The central theme to this
approach is social development. Underpinning this approach is the
recognition that while there is a need to address the symptoms of problems
through material relief or grants, sustainable development strategies are
required, strategies which focus on building institutional capacity to
address structural economic conditions such as long-term quality
employment.
Our target group in the antipoverty programme will continue to be the
unemployed in disadvantaged communities, with the emphasis on poverty
pockets in the province, youth in disadvantaged communities, people with
disabilities, social security beneficiaries, not-for-profit NGOs, CBOs,
institutions and service providers. We believe that merely funding
individual poverty relief projects will not have a significant long-term
poverty impact. We are embarking on financing models that will promote the
establishment and growth of development nodes and contribute to local
economic development. This approach will rely on strong collaborative
project facilitation methodologies, well-grounded research and accurate,
reliable information systems for poverty targeting.

To reduce duplication and wastage in the war against poverty, the province
has established an interdepartmental committee which brings together all
the departments. This will ensure that there is co-ordination, that we
apply the same criteria and that there is one clearing house for all
projects. We are also in the process of engaging the communities of faith
and all other NGOs to ensure that these programmes do really make an impact
in our communities.
The flagship project at Bekkersdal, which was implemented during 1997,
demonstrates that developmental approach social welfare can be made a
reality as it combines income generation with skills training and early
childhood development programmes. At its inception this project only
consisted of a fast-food outlet and only employed about 25 women. At
present it has a food garden restaurant facility, a car facility, an
overnight facility catering for 14 people, a beauty salon, a recreation
centre and a crèche, and in total now employs about 170 women. Further
flagship programmes have been established in the following areas:
Germiston, Katlehong, Vosloorus, Devon, Daveyton, Kagiso, Dobsonville,
Randfontein and Toekomsrus.

In the past year 115 antipoverty programmes received close to R18,3 million
from both national and provincial departments. Eighty percent of these
programmes targeted women, with the remaining 20% of programmes targeting
people with disabilities and the youth.

As regards social security, we consider social security to be one of the
major poverty alleviation mechanisms, reaching over 300 000 beneficiaries
in Gauteng, and putting R168 million in the hands of beneficiaries and
their families every month. Due to increased efficiency in this area, there
has been an 11% increase in the number of beneficiaries, and in many areas
we have been able to achieve an average one-month turnaround period for
social grant application and payment. There are areas which are still
lagging behind and we are putting systems in place to ensure that they also
reach an average one-month turnaround time. The child support grant
beneficiaries have increased in our province from 2 505 on 1 April 1999 to
over 60 000 by the end of May.

As regards violence against women and children, the department is the lead
department in the victim empowerment programme under the National Crime
Prevention Strategy, which provides support to survivors of crime and
violence. Victim empowerment is essential, firstly for making it possible
for a victim to heal and recover from the crime with the least possible
harm or loss, and secondly for ensuring that the victim is empowered to
contribute to a process of restorative justice by entrenching
internationally accepted basic victims' rights, as agreed upon by the UN.

The programme aims to provide one-stop centres at victim-friendly police
stations. Three centres have been launched in a partnership with key
departments such as Safety and Security, Health and Education. The centres
are based at Eldorado Park police station, and Chris Hani Baragwanath and
Leratong Hospitals. Many of these services operate on a 24-hour basis and
are staffed by volunteers who have undergone the necessary training. We are
currently focusing on developing some of these centres in rural and
periurban areas, as well as informal settlements.

As regards the issue of HIV-Aids, the department is involved in national
pilot programmes such as the children-in-distress model of KwaZulu-Natal,
which is a network of social welfare agencies and other stakeholders. We
are developing models which will provide the best possible quality of
upbringing for a large number of orphans, rapid identification and
placement of orphaned, abandoned and abused children, economic self-
sufficiency for people who care for orphans, and motivation and support for
people and organisations involved in social services.

Secondly, we are involved in the care and intervention programme for
children and families affected by the Aids epidemic. This is an integral
part of the professional health care system at Kalafong Hospital and
Pretoria Academic Hospital. Working amongst people infected with and
affected by HIV-Aids, Carocs was recommended in the recently published
national Aids review as being an ideal combined community-hospital-NGO
model of care for people living with Aids. [Applause.]

Ms N C KONDLO (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, comrade Minister, hon
members and comrades, my colleagues from the different provinces.

Ingaba ndiyavakala Mhlali-ngaphambili?

UMHLALINGAPHAMBILI WEBHUNGA LESIZWE LAMAPHONDO: Uyavakala.

Nksz N C KONDLO: Nam mandi zibandakanye nabasele bethethile phambi kwam
ndibulele ngokunikwa kwethu inkxaxheba siliphondo laseMpuma Koloni yokuba
size kuxoxa ngolu hlahlo-lwabiwo mali kule Ndlu.

IPhondo leMpuma Koloni liphondo elinembali yokungabina mathuba emisebenzi
ngaphezu kwamashumi amahlanu ekhulwini, ngokomlinganiselo, ndaweni nye
nendlala egqubayo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Am I audible, Chairperson?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You are.

Ms N C KONDLO: Let me also fall into step with those who have spoken before
me and express our gratitude as a province for the opportunity to come and
participate in this Budget Vote in this House.

The Eastern Cape is a province with a history of having not more than 50%
job opportunities, in addition to widespread poverty.]

It is under these socioeconomic conditions that the department of welfare
in the Eastern Cape has to render welfare services.

Again, it is common knowledge indeed that the department of welfare in the
Eastern Cape has, once more, been in the media for the past two weeks
because of issues and/or problems that relate to social grants. For a
province such as ours, we have to render and manage the social security
payment grants, 60% of which are cheque payments, to approximately 600 000
beneficiaries. We have almost 465 officials to render that service. This,
in practical terms, translates to a ratio of approximately 1 300
beneficiaries to one official without the outsourcing of the payment
function. This is more than double the national norm of 500:1 with the
payment of grants having been outsourced. It was interesting, indeed, to
listen to the MEC from Gauteng where they have a total of about 300 000
beneficiaries.

It bears noting, therefore, that the department of welfare in the Eastern
Cape utilises its in-house human resources to effect the payment of grants.
As a result, each month, the social security personnel have to spend two-
thirds of their time doing payments in the field, and one-third of the time
being in office to do administration. This, of course, is a recipe for the
ongoing accumulation of backlogs in that province. This indeed has an
impact on the segregation of functions which gives rise to the high levels
of fraud and mismanagement, as the same official who processes the
application is responsible for payment.

Be that as it may, we pride ourselves, as the province of the Eastern Cape,
on having amalgamated three administrations with six systems into one since
1994 and we believe that the outsourcing programme, which is in an advanced
stage as we speak, will go a long way in addressing some of the problems.
We believe that the benefit of outsourcing will relieve the social security
personnel of the fieldwork that they have to do, and enable them to devote
their time to the functioning as well as the administration of the social
security system. We believe this will improve the service delivery levels
in line with the Batho Pele principles, and will also reduce the incidence
of fraud and corruption in the system itself, as well as eliminate the risk
to life and limb.

I think we should again say, as the department of welfare and as the
province of the Eastern Cape, that we believe the review process on the
policy on disability grants will also go a long way in addressing some of
the problems and/or challenges that we are faced with in that province.

The department of welfare in the Eastern Cape is faced with enormous
challenges as far as fraud and corruption are concerned. The department is
engaged in a number of strategies which include continuous data running,
regular file audits, proper review of grants, proper reconciliation, public
education, quick handling of detected fraudulent activities and, indeed,
immediate disciplinary action that is taken where departmental staff are
involved. But I must hasten to say that this, in many instances, is indeed
a difficult programme to implement due to shortages of staff within the
department.

I will now address the issue of the integration of social services: The
national initiative of the bosberaad that was held towards the end of last
year whose theme was the integration of social welfare services and which
focused on the integration of social security into the broader social
services that are rendered by the department, the professionalisation of
social security and the sharing of best-practicemodels within and amongst
provinces will, we believe, assist us in terms of ensuring that the
integration will go a long way in rendering service to the poorest of the
poor in an integrated manner. We believe the next bosberaad that will be
held in September will also enhance our delivery structure and strategy
programme.

With regard to poverty eradication, as the Minister and the speakers before
me have indicated, in the past financial years one of the major problems
that the department faced was around the management of this programme. We
believe that the steps that the Minister together with his colleagues has
taken, will go a long way in addressing some of the problems.

Kodwa ndiyafuna ukongeza ngelithi, thina phaya kwiphondo leMpuma Koloni
siyifumanisile into yokuba, le nto yokumana sisithi xa sigxotha indlala
ekhaya masisoloko sisenza amagcuntswana eeprojekti, esicinga into yokuba
aza kusincedisa ekugxotheni indlala, ayisincedi nganto. Yiyo loo nto
sisithi siliphondo sifuna ukushenxa siye kwinqanaba apho ... [However, I do
want to add that we in the Eastern Cape realised that trying to alleviate
poverty by taking up projects in dribs and drabs does not help us at all.
That is the reason we say as a province that we want to move to a level
where ... ]

... the project itself will ensure that it benefits the broader society
rather than a group of individuals.

Again, we believe that the changes and interventions that the Minister has
outlined this afternoon in this debate will enhance the poverty eradication
programme to the maximum.

With regard to the impact of HIV-Aids on the welfare system, it is indeed a
fact that an increase in HIV-Aids will impact on our budget as a province
and, I believe, on all of us as a nation in the sense that the number of
children who will be orphaned due to Aids-related death will increase and
they will have to be taken care of by the Department of Welfare as the lead
department. The number of women who will not be able to perform their
parental function and therefore render children vulnerable to child neglect
will increase. This, indeed, will increase our social assistance and social
security budgets because, as we know, the needs of these children will have
to be budgeted for in the intersectoral integrated plan that the Department
of Welfare, together with that of Health and of Education has set up, and
in the pilot projects that are in the process of being implemented in the
province. This means, therefore, that the 93% of our budget that is spent
on social security will indeed increase.

I then want to come to the most important aspect of the state of affairs in
the province of the Eastern Cape which relates to our delivery of services.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr A MARAIS: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, in his budget
speech in April this year, the Minister for Welfare and Population
Development indicated that the challenge of Government during this term of
office would be to consolidate the policy gains of the past five years into
concrete programmatic changes, and I quote:


  ... so that the ordinary citizens especially those who experience the
  worst forms of poverty, can begin to see the evidence of real change in
  their daily lives.

He then went on to identify the national priorities that need to be
addressed during the present term of Government in order to achieve this.
We, in the Free State, fully endorse what the hon the Minister stated, and
have accepted his invitation to join him in the implementation and
monitoring of these national priorities so that we can help make a
difference in the lives of the most needy and disadvantaged people in the
Free State.
I will highlight only some of the concrete steps that we have undertaken in
the Free State to implement the national priorities which the Minister
referred to in his speech. On the implementation of an integrated poverty
eradication strategy, the Free State is experiencing high levels of
poverty, especially in rural areas. Our own poverty eradication strategy
indicates that the poverty level in our province stands at 63%, while
Qwaqwa has the highest at 88%.

Poor households are characterised by a lack of wage income as a result of
unemployment or low wages. Census '96 has shown that the workforce in the
Free State is the lowest paid in the country and this in itself keeps those
rural areas trapped in poverty.

Individuals are unable to take full advantage of the few amenities to which
they have access. From 1997 to 1999 funds to the value of R16 million were
allocated for social development, and the primary focus was on poverty
eradication through economic, human and social development.

The province will continue with a number of different developmental
programmes for promoting self-employment, income generation and the
acquisition of skills. Other Government departments and NGOs are
contributing towards skills development, for example the Department of
Labour, training institutions, etc. Funds have been set aside to promote
the sustainability of projects.

With regard to social security, the Free State will continue to provide
social assistance benefits to our most vulnerable citizens. It is our
intention to increase the number of children benefiting from the child
support grants by 60 000 this financial year.

The reregistration of our beneficiaries that commenced in 1997 will be
completed by this month. It is important to reiterate the point that the
reregistration process is not, and was never, aimed at removing legitimate
grant beneficiaries from the system. It was, and remains, a deliberate
programme to eradicate fraud and corruption from our system. As we complete
this process we will continue addressing complaints and enquiries by those
wrongly removed from the system.

With regard to violence against women and children, the province will
continue training volunteers to offer effective survivor-support services
to victims of domestic violence. There is an increasing need for shelters
for abused women in the province. We are looking into the establishment of
emergency safety centres during this financial year. There is already a
shelter established in Bloemfontein, and two others are planned for the
southern and northern Free State respectively.

With regard to HIV-Aids, the province has committed itself to making
certain that the service we are rendering to children extends to those
infected and affected by HIV-Aids. Firstly, during this financial year we
are implementing our comprehensive LSE programme, which is a prevention
programme through the promotion of positive values, lifestyles and
behaviour. Secondly, we are strengthening the capacity of the individual,
family and communities to provide for the care, protection and development
of persons infected and affected by HIV-Aids. Aids co-ordinators have been
appointed in all our districts. Thirdly, in collaboration with the
Department of Health, we have designed, as a pilot project, home-based and
community-based care with regard to HIV-Aids. Fourthly, the rise of HIV-
Aids threatens the growth of the population of this country and the
province. The population unit has been tasked to look into the programme on
HIV-Aids, with specific reference to population development.

Regarding the issue of young people in trouble with the law, children and
young people in conflict with the law will continue to receive services in
the province. We have a privately run,  modern, securecare centre in
Kroonstad, and we will be opening a second securecare centre which will be
combined with the one-stop youth justice services in the province.
[Interjections.] Sorry, Minister, sorry! [Laughter.]

With regard to redesigning services for people with disabilities, the
fragmented nature of the service delivery system for people with
disabilities often leads to a lack of effective referral to other sectors.
This means that social welfare has to deal with education, employment,
transport and housing-related issues.

Changing the way people regard disability, from purely health and welfare
issues to primary human rights and development issues, has significant
implications for the principles, objectives and goals of the existing
welfare services. The welfare services, as currently rendered by NGOs, need
to be redesigned to facilitate independence in society rather than
dependence on welfare services.

To this effect, we have facilitated the establishment of the disability
desk in the office of the premier. Agreements have been reached with NGOs
that render services on our behalf to people with disabilities to orientate
the personnel of the department to be disability-sensitive in community
development processes. The department will integrate the development of
support services for persons with disabilities in communities, as
stipulated by the White Paper on an Integrated National Disability
Strategy. We will, in collaboration with other departments, attend to the
development of children with disabilities.

The province is in the process of designing a diversion programme for
people with temporary disabilities who have been taken off the social
security system. This prevents dependency and ensures social integration of
people with disabilities.

As I said earlier, I have highlighted only a few of our present programmes
in the Free State which are in line with national priorities.
In conclusion, we commit ourselves to continuing to find innovative ways of
addressing community needs. We will continue to make sure that we mobilise
for a caring society. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Perhaps, hon
member, you can now enjoy your laughter.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs, hon special
delegates and equally honourable members, I will try to resist catching the
infectious disease of the previous speaker. [Laughter.]

The appropriateness of any welfare programme of any society is not only
judged by its theories, but is also judged, mostly, by how it cares for and
delivers to the poor and, especially, the most vulnerable. Our provincial
and community programmes are led by national initiatives which, at the
present moment, are by far the most advanced and caring compared to those
in the rest of the world.

It is most unfortunate that instead of recording successes flowing from
these elaborate programmes laid out on paper, we have to experience the
agony of narrating some failures, which failures are brought about by poor
performance at best, and total nonperformance at worst.

We should continue, however, to probe what all officials, and especially
those at the higher echelons of this department, keep themselves busy with
all day if they do not attend to the work at hand. We should also probe why
senior management in the Department of Welfare do not pick up problems
routinely. We only learn about these problems from the annual report of the
Auditor-General. We would like to see the department not only reporting on
its successes to the Select Committee on Social Services, but on its
constraints and challenges as well.

Since the budget forms a major programme of action for the department, one
would expect then that the senior management of the department should
monitor progress of this major programme on a continual basis and highlight
all major constraints timeously. To receive a report at the end of the
financial year lamenting constraints such as lack of capacity, lack of
infrastructure and so forth, is but a futile exercise that has all the
hallmarks of a management structure lacking in commitment, dedication and
above all, the transformatory direction which this Government has embarked
on since 1994.

My information indicates that there are cadets trained in project
initiation, project implementation, project management and the formulation
of business plans in the various provinces, who were trained through the
RDP programmes since 1994. In particular, in Mpumalanga, these cadets have
completed some major projects with remarkable success. I am referring here
to the community halls, inter alia, built at Phiva, Silindile and
Kromdraai. These projects are landmarks of the capabilities of project
implementation executed by the communities. It therefore comes as an insult
to these able members of the community to say that the funds could not be
expended because there is no capacity. Our challenge is one of closer
communication and co-ordination so that we as public representatives
actively assist in creating a better life for all, especially for the
poorest of the poor.

We would not, at any rate, like to have a situation in which people go
hungry whilst the Government has resources, but these resources cannot be
accessed. I am sure that such a situation eats away at the conscience of
every one of us in this House.

Another disturbing report that I have received about social grant
applications in my province is the situation where landowners complete
application forms on behalf of their illiterate workers, and, on approval
of these applications, the landowners acquire procuration holder status.
This then essentially means that the landowner is entitled to receive the
money on behalf of the beneficiary. Unfortunately some of these landowners
are not so honest.

Another grave concern is the declaration of disability by district
surgeons. These doctors seemingly have excessive discretionary powers in
these matters. It has come to my attention that sometimes they deny
deserving cases. Because of the unfettered discretion they enjoy they
cannot be challenged, so the destitute people continue to starve just
because the doctor denied them access to Government assistance. In this
process, our goals as Government are severely undermined. I would appeal to
the hon the Minister to intervene in addressing this anomaly.

The MINISTER FOR WELFARE AND POPULATION DEVELOPMENT: [Inaudible.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Yes, I have mentioned that, hon Minister. We are partners
in that. [Laughter.]

I believe that the Department of Welfare has not deviated from its goal to
bring about a better life for all. I believe that they are still very much
committed to improving the quality of life, but we need to tighten the
management structures, so that we all grind in the same direction.
[Applause.]

Ms M M KHUNWANA (North West): Chairperson, thank you for giving me this
opportunity for commenting on the review debate on Welfare and Population
Development. Hon Minister, MECs from the provinces, NCOP members, members
from the standing committees, distinguished guests, fraud within the
department and the CPS was so great that the department, in its endeavour
to fight fraud and corruption, has designed a multipronged approach. A
committee, chaired by MEC R N Rasmeni, has been established to address
fraud and corruption in the welfare system. Any official who carries out
any fraudulent actions will be severely dealt with. The new system of
paying cash to beneficiaries will be fraud-free, through ensuring that only
the beneficiary or procurator will be allowed to draw money.
Appropriate selection and training of pensioner committees will be carried
out during this financial year. Those officials who have fraudulently
received social pensions, whilst in employment with the same state, are
being dealt with severely. The province has embarked upon a reregistration
process which aims to eradicate fraud and ghost beneficiaries. A clean
database is what is aimed at. The provinces received a high return of
responses in respect of the reregistration process, with 96% of cash
beneficiaries having reregistered and 92% of those beneficiaries receiving
payments through banks and post offices successfully being reregistered.

The department has suspended 7 500 beneficiaries. Reasons for suspensions
have been that pensioners were not disabled, the medical condition was
treatable, a specialist report was required, the medical form was
incomplete, not enough objective medical information was available, and the
person was not an RSA citizen.

This issue of people not being RSA citizens has posed a big problem in our
province, because most of these nonresidents of South Africa are people
from the former Bophutatswana who, indeed, are born South Africans.
However, due to the legacy of the past government they are left out as
noncitizens of South Africa, and are not able to secure any pensions. I
hope the Department of Welfare and Population Development, together with
the Department of Home Affairs, will be able to assist in this regard,
because Home Affairs is not within our competency. It is within the
competency of the national Government. In those applications where
sufficient evidence was available, ensuring the beneficiaries were entitled
to the grant, they have been immediately reinstated into the system.

It is clear that disability was often defined by the district surgeon on
the basis of the individual's socioeconomic status, and not on medical
grounds. Workshops have been conducted with medical teams regarding
appropriate assessment. The disability policy requires rigorous review, and
the need for strengthening the safety net and the provisions for a basic
income grant, especially for the unemployed, cannot be underestimated.

Finally, a critical success factor is the management of fraud and
corruption in the department, aimed towards 98% elimination of fraud in the
payment of grants and 98% of beneficiaries receiving appropriate grants on
time. Eighty percent of eligible beneficiaries are reached.

Regarding the poverty alleviation programme, a poverty fund was announced
by the Minister of Finance in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 financial years. An
amount of R4 million was secured for the North West province in 1997-98,
and R14 million was secured from the R203 million in 1998-99. The
evaluation of the R4 million allocation has been completed by the national
Department of Welfare. In both these allocations, the province has made an
effort to reach the poorest communities.

The call for business plans was constrained by late notices. A broad range
of communication strategies was utilised and extensive collaboration with
the NGO sector was undertaken. Three hundred and thirty-six projects were
forwarded to the national Department of Welfare for approval, and only 114
were funded. Effective targeting of poverty pockets in the province guided
the process, shifting from isolated projects to comprehensive and
integrated poverty eradication programmes.

The allocation made to the province by the national Department of Welfare
is not commensurate with the poverty profile of the province. Abject
poverty in the province is compounded by the absence of job opportunities,
inadequate water and sanitation services, and a high level of male
absenteeism due to migratory search for employment.

Nine percent of South Africans reside in the North West province, and 60%
of this 9% population is rural. A provincial poverty committee has been
established, with representatives from other government departments, the
local universities, the NGO and CBO sectors. Much planning has taken place
towards the development of an antipoverty strategy for the North West
province.

Furthermore, clear monitoring and evaluation measures as well as an
integrated plan have been designed towards rural development. The committee
is also addressing the development of antipoverty policies. The development
of a management information system is imperative for the province to ensure
appropriate targeting.
In the two former poverty fund allocations, all moneys have been increased
in terms of business plans, and projects have been submitted. In a few
instances, goals and objectives have had to be reformulated to ensure
sustainability. Seventy-five percent of the poverty alleviation programmes
have been extended to agricultural projects, promoting job creation and the
development of SMMEs. In addition, allocations have been made to disabled
groups and low-income groups. The province boasts many successes.

Next, I would like to talk about flagship programmes for women and children
under five. The community empowerment project piloted by the national
department in the province demonstrates some best-practice models and
principles of community and sustainable development.

Regarding the management of social grants, the North West has the third
highest poverty rate of the nine provinces, but the sixth lowest number of
beneficiaries in the country. The social security expenditure is below the
national average of R364,00 per capita. The unequal coverage of target
population shows the province's lack of capacity and information on the
need and demand for services, which reflect negatively on the adequacy of
services.

To address this issue, the popularisation of social grants has taken place
with the help of MEC Rachel Rasmeni, who put together an extensive road
show promotion. The 300% rapid uptake of child support grants demonstrates
the effectiveness of the popularisation strategy. At present the department
is paying 228 590 beneficiaries through banks, post offices and at 730
paypoints in the province.

The Department envisages an increase in beneficiaries of 240 000 in the
current financial year. [Time expired.]

Prince G L ZULU (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues,
I will touch on only three issues, namely poverty alleviation, the review
of pension beneficiaries and fraud.

I will start with fraud, and I am going to talk about strategies to fight
fraud and corruption. Fraud and corruption is one of the ailments that
continue to bleed Government of millions. In all public and other meetings,
I caution both staff and members of the public of the impact that
corruption causes when it comes to delivery of services and the resultant
penalty.

We do not take any pride in the number of officials we have charged so far
as this could be construed to be a bad reflection on the part of the
management. However, this phenomenon, theft and corruption, is not unique
to welfare alone. What is important is the pace the welfare department is
setting in fighting this scourge. Through partnerships with the Departments
of Justice, of Health and Education and the SA Police Service, we have been
able and continue to put culprits behind bars. Asidlali, siyabopha -
sigquma ejele. [We are not joking, we make arrests, we put criminals in
prison.] [Laughter.]

Our conviction statistics are as follows: 36 suspended government
officials; 28 charged government officials; 11 charged members of the
public; and 91 cases pending trial in court. Regarding the question of rand
savings, loss and projections, government has been saved millions of rands
through joint operations mounted by the government fraud unit of KwaZulu-
Natal. [Interjections.] Ewe, ndakhula ngobisi mntanexhego, hayi ngejusi. [I
grew up drinking milk, not juice.] [Laughter.] [Interjections.]
Savings from creche investigations amount to R103 113 780. With regard to
losses related to creche fraud alone in the three-year period - 1997, 1998
and 1999 totals R3 526 610,30 to date. It is anticipated that within the
next five-year period, the department projects its savings to total R3,079
million.

Regarding the question of new methods of defrauding the state, there are a
number of methods people now employ in order to milk government funds.

These are, firstly, the presentation of wrong identity documents for
disability grants; secondly, the illegal production of birth certificates
for child support grants; thirdly, capturing of information without
supporting documentation and using banks and post offices as conduits. This
is not only common in KwaZulu, but it is also common all over the country.
[Interjections.]

To date, a calculated loss of money syphoned via the post offices amounts
to R1 117 604,97. In Durban alone, a single syndicate involving bank
transactions is responsible for a loss of R379 188,11. This incident led to
a staff member leaping to his death from the 10th floor during an attempted
arrest. What a shame!

In terms of the latest evaluation instruments on the ground, eg fiscal
audit of projects, etc, we can confirm that the goals of Government are
being realised in that we see an improvement and difference in the faces of
the previously disadvantaged poor communities. We must, however, admit that
there were some teething problems noted on the ground.

In KwaZulu-Natal alone we still have vast tracts of land which we have not
covered through this intervention. There are thousands, if not millions, of
poor rural communities who have, to date, not accessed this funding due to
limited resources.

The Human Sciences Research Council has identified a number of areas as
poverty pockets in KwaZulu-Natal. Unfortunately, we have not been able to
cater for projects for people with disabilities and people infected with
and affected by the HIV-Aids epidemic. The demand is still great. It is
therefore our humble submission to the NCOP that additional funding be made
available to the Department of Welfare in order for it to meet its
constitutional obligations and wipe out the suffering painted on the faces
of our impoverished people.

I will now talk about the review of pension beneficiaries or
reregistration. The KwaZulu-Natal welfare department embarked on a process
of cleaning up the payment of grants system. The process involved
reregistration, conducting of means tests and revamping the payment system
itself.

The reregistration project was essentially a review of each current
beneficiary in the province in terms of the legislation. Good progress has
been recorded since the project was initiated. To date, a total of 568 843
interviews has been completed.

Regarding savings, we have suspended 25 177 beneficiaries through
reregistration, and this represents a projected saving of R52 million.

An additional 39 593 grants, with a projected savings of R17 million per
month, will be stopped. The only remaining challenge regarding this
important exercise is the proper management of the proposed bulk suspension
of 39 000 grants. Although most desired capital will be freed as a result
of this project, some of it will be used to fund the winding-off exercise.

These were just highlights of the problems facing welfare and the need for
more resources in order to enable the welfare department to meet its
obligations. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs, colleagues, H W Longfellow
once said, and I quote:


  Through this toilsome world, alas!
  Once and only once I pass;
  If a kindness I may show,
  If a good deed I may do
  To a suffering fellowman,
  Let me do it while I can.

These words apply to each and everybody in this House. I would like to
stress that the elderly, the poor and the frail are the responsibility of
every member. We need a more caring society. We need a change of heart and
attitude, and we need to build a better life for all, now. We have been
quoting the Presidents many times this afternoon. The Minister quoted
President Mbeki's words ``hope has taken the place of despair''.

I want to quote the President in his address at the start of the second
term of Parliament where he said, and I quote:


  ... our practical actions must ensure that none can challenge us when we
  say - we are a nation at work to build a better life!

Now, a year later, we are not at work, we are not building a better life
and we are not caring for our people. I have the facts and the figures to
confirm this statement. The main responsibility of a government is the
welfare of its people. If the government is not capable of even working and
spending according to its budget, the future looks bleak, indeed. The
Auditor-General's figures showed huge amounts that were simply not spent on
various projects. These are as follows: In 1996-97, R52 million spent; in
1997-98, R110 million unspent; in 1998-99, R353 million unspent; and in
1999-2000, R203 million unspent.

Other irregularities are as follows: Prepayments totalling R766 000 were
made to 13 organisations without the required treasury approval; R350 000
was paid to an organisation before the contract was entered into; R50 000
was paid to a project not related to welfare - and I can go on and on.

We need ministerial guidance to oversee effective management. I hear what
the MEC from the Eastern Cape, Ms Kondlo, is saying and I know that she
really has problems and challenges in the Eastern Cape. She must please do
what she can, because I know of shocking stories about what is happening in
the Eastern Cape. The fact is that these incidents are happening because
the poor and the elderly simply cannot survive on their own and are being
exploited by criminals in society.

In die lig van bogenoemde syfers en verslae van die Ouditeur-generaal stem
dit 'n mens opnuut tot kommer as dit duidelik word dat dit deur
nalatigheid, agtelosigheid en onbekwaamheid is dat ons armes en bejaardes
die slagoffers word van gewetenlose skurke wat jag maak op ou en verswakte
mense.

So kan die voorsitter van die Sterkspruit-komitee vir bejaardes getuig van
talle bejaardes wat verwaarloos is omdat hulle niemand het om hulle te
versorg nie, want hulle kan nie pensioen kry nie, bloot omdat daar 'n fout
op hulle geboortesertifikaat is. Bejaardes kan nie veilige huisvesting
bekostig nie en dan word hulle in hierdie onveilige skuilings verkrag.

Ek kan van nog baie gruweldade teenoor ons bejaardes vertel, maar laat ek
liewer weer die agb Minister herinner dat mense in die Oos-Kaap nog steeds
baie ure moet wag vir hulle pensioengeld. Ek het egter gehoor die Minister
sê hy gee aandag daaraan, en baie dankie daarvoor.

Dit is ook onder my aandag gebring hoe moeilik dit geword het om net 'n
aansoekvorm om pensioen by die regte amptenaar te kry. Ek weet van 'n dame
in Schauderville in Port Elizabeth wat nou al - agb lede sal my nie glo nie
- ses weke lank probeer om onder die eerste 40 persone in die aansoekry te
kom sodat haar vorm aanvaar kan word. Die wortel van die kwaad in die
Departement van Welsyn is die onbeholpenheid en gebrek aan doelgerigtheid
en doeltreffendheid van die amptenare.

Ek dink ons moet ophou om die simptome te probeer genees. 'n Verhoging van
R20 in die pensioen maak nie eintlik só 'n verskil nie. Ek wil sê, wat wel
'n verskil kan maak aan die lewenskwaliteit van ons mense is 'n
menswaardige behandeling, dissipline by die uitbetalingspunte, presiese
administrasie en onbevooroordeelde hantering van aansoeke. Ons mense moet
die Departement van Welsyn sien as 'n vriendelike, hulpvaardige instelling
en as 'n vriend in nood. Hulle moenie in vrees lewe vir dié dag in die
maand wanneer hulle moet gaan om te vra vir wat hulle reg is nie.

Ek wil afsluit waar ek begin het. Kom ons probeer almal om uit te reik en
te doen wat ons kan om ons medemens se ellende te verlig. Kom ons dring aan
op doeltreffende administrasie sodat ons ons mense en kinders naby ons hou
sodat daar nie dalk 'n dag aanbreek wanneer niemand meer hoop het nie. Ek
haal Kahlil Gibran aan:


  Die hoogtepunt van ellende is om 'n leë hand na jou medemens uit te steek
  en niks te ontvang nie. Die hoogtepunt van hopeloosheid is egter om
  gevulde hande na jou medemens uit te hou en daar is niemand wat iets wil
  neem nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[In the light of the above figures and reports of the Auditor-General one
is once again concerned when it becomes clear that it is through
negligence, carelessness and incompetence that our poor and elderly are the
victims of unscrupulous villains who prey on the old and the frail.

Thus the chairman of the Sterkspruit committee for the aged can testify
that many aged people are neglected because they have no one to look after
them, because they cannot receive a pension, merely because there is an
error on their birth certificate. The aged cannot afford safe housing, and
are then raped in these unsafe dwellings.

I can give many more examples of atrocities committed against our elderly,
but let me rather remind the hon the Minister again that people in the
Eastern Cape still have to wait many hours for their pensions. However, I
heard the Minister say that he is giving attention to this, and I want to
thank him most sincerely for that.

It has also been brought to my attention how difficult it has become merely
to get an application form for a pension from the right official. I know of
a lady in Schauderville in Port Elizabeth who has been trying - hon members
will not believe me - for six weeks to be one of the first 40 people in the
application queue to get her form accepted. The root of the trouble in the
Department of Welfare is the ineptness and lack of purpose and efficiency
of the officials.

I think we should stop trying to cure the symptoms. An increase of R20 in
the pension does not really make such a big difference. I want to say that
what can make a difference to the quality of life of our people is humane
treatment, discipline at the pay points, accurate administration and
unprejudiced handling of applications. Our people should regard the
Department of Welfare as a friendly, helpful institution, and as a friend
in need. They should not live in fear of the day in the month when they
have to go and ask for what is rightfully theirs.

I want to conclude where I started. Let all of us try to reach out and do
what we can to relieve the misery of our fellow men. Let us insist on
efficient administration so that we keep our people and children close to
us so that the day never dawns when no one has hope any longer.

Kahlil Gibran said that the height of misery was to extend an empty hand to
one's fellow humans and to receive nothing. The height of hopelessness,
however, is to hold out full hands to one's fellow humans and there is no
one who wants to take something. [Applause.]]

Mr F A WYNGAARDT (Northern Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members of
the NCOP and hon MECs, as a nation, we are currently challenged with the
most critical period of transformation within our welfare system. We are
content that the policy formulation process has progressed considerably and
provision of welfare services has been properly established.

The vision of the Department of Social Services and Population Development
in the Northern Cape is to have a welfare service delivery system which
promotes self-reliance within a caring society. The creation of a caring
society gives rise to the fact that Batho Pele becomes our way of life in
the department. It is the most important priority in this department which
will be reflected within all programmes and policies of the department.

The following are the critical aspects I wish to highlight to this
gathering today. Social security is one of the major challenges facing this
department with 105 000 people depending on the payment of social grants.
The provincial office is co-ordinating six regions which are managed by
social security managers. We have an operation centre which is responsible
for the training of social security personnel and the interpretation of the
Social Assistance Act and regulations. It also serves as a help desk with a
toll-free number for beneficiaries to register their complaints.

The payment of social grants has been outsourced to a private company, Cash
Paymaster Services. Two hundred and eighteen paypoints, 22 district
offices, 13 satellite offices and 34 service points have been established
throughout the province.

Welfare volunteer committees have been established to assist with crowd
control on payment days. We have recently established a welfare review
committee which enables communities to participate in the screening of
disability grant applications.

The department echoed the establishment of a comprehensive social security
system as embodied within the 10-point plan of the national Minister. It
was very disturbing to get reports and allegations, during a visit to one
of the regions in the province, of gross abuse of human rights of
farmworkers who are beneficiaries in the province. During my visit to Van
Wyksvlei, an old man told me: ``MEC, ek het op die plaas gewerk en 'n sak
mielies het op my rug geval.'' [``MEC, I worked on the farm and a sack of
maize fell on my back.''] Another family at Middelpos told me: ``MEC, ons
het op die boer se plaas gewerk en is weggejaag. Ons het geen heenkome
gehad nie.''[MEC, we worked on the farm and the farmer sent us packing. We
had nowhere to go.'']

'n Ander vrou het gesê: ``MEC, ek betaal maandeliks huur aan die boer vir
'n huis wat my man self gebou het.'' [Another woman said: ``MEC, I pay the
farmer monthly rent for a house that my husband built himself.'']

This Government can no longer tolerate the abuse of farmworkers and older
persons. It is also within the light of this gross violation of human
rights that we need to develop a comprehensive social security system that
links contributory and noncontributory schemes and priorities to the most
vulnerable households. Such a system must reduce dependency on
noncontributory cash payments by this Government. Farmers should therefore
take responsibility in contributing towards the retirement of their own
farmworkers.

This department is vigorous in the fight against fraud and corruption, and
an internal control unit with the objective to conduct auditing in all
sectors as well as to investigate grey areas in the socpen system has been
established within the department. This unit is currently conducting a
compliance audit into the poverty alleviation projects. An
interdepartmental internal control steering committee was established to
oversee fraud and corruption within the department. This committee meets
once a month to discuss the matters brought before it by the internal
control unit.

Regarding the integration of all former welfare systems, the Northern Cape
province was faced with the integration of the House of Assembly, House of
Representatives and the Cape Provincial Administration. The process of
amalgamating the three different administrations was swift and the
department is currently functioning as an established unitary entity.

The central theme of the transformation of the social services is social
development, which aims to bring about sustainable improvements in the
wellbeing of poor and vulnerable individuals, families and communities.
Derived from the department's mission, the core business of the social
development programme is to focus on poverty alleviation, reduction and
eradication.

The department received R10,8 million, as awarded by the national
department. This allocation enabled the department to fund 120 community-
based projects. In addition to these 120 funded small business programmes,
the department is still engaged in the support and monitoring of the
previously funded projects. We have succeeded in establishing 20 projects
as fully fledged businesses by securing government contracts through
tendering.

To date, the provincial tender board has secured three-year tender
contracts to poverty projects in cleaning services, catering, laundering,
sewing and security services. Through this process, employment was created
for 150 persons. The monthly income of approximately R500 to R1 400 is far
in excess of the R100 provided in the child support grant.

The sustainability of most projects is in question due to the lack of
markets - no market research was done in respect of projects - and business
plans which were poorly designed. A critical need is the support of
technical experts for marketing, finance and project management. Social
development staff, project members and the cluster co-ordinators lack the
necessary business development and financial skills. The geographical
vastness and remote rural areas have also contributed to the difficulty to
provide on-line support and guidance to projects.

In honouring the corrective measures that were instituted by the national
Minister, Minister Skweyiya, this province was proactive in ensuring the
financial administration of the poverty relief programme. We have embarked
on a financial auditing process in respect of every individual project.

We are committed to preserving our nation and are therefore vigorous in the
fight against HIV-Aids. This department is a role-player in the provincial
interdepartmental committee on HIV-Aids. This deadly virus will have a
devastating impact on the welfare system. The number of orphans will impact
on the social security system and statutory obligations in child care
legislation.

In a family where the mother or father dies, the remaining parent, if
unemployed and the children are not over the age of seven, will apply for
child support grant. In a case where both parents die or where a single
parent dies as a result of Aids, the children will be placed in foster care
and a foster care grant paid.

There will be a child-headed household which will have a social impact on
community life. Community-based care activities will have financial
implications for this department, eg. strengthening of families,
alternative care placement options and safety houses. Social relief will
also have to be provided for families infected who have no source of
income.

Cabinet has established an interministerial committee on HIV-Aids in order
to monitor the trends and programmes in our fight against HIV. An
interdepartmental committee has been established to extensively involve
government departments in HIV-Aids mobilisation. Departments such as
Welfare, Health and Education have developed a programme for children
infected and affected by the epidemic.

We need to intensify our mass mobilisation campaign. Within the next month,
a provincial Aids council will be in place, and by the end of the financial
year 2002, regional Aids councils will be in operation. The department has
restructured the Mimosa Place for Safety into a multipurpose centre for
persons living with HIV-Aids.

This programme is spearheaded by the Department of Health and is
conceptualised on a multidisciplinary facet approach. The centre will
provide economic empowerment programmes, counselling services, family
reintegration and day care facilities for children of parents who
participate in the programme.

The restoration of the ethics of care into our programmes is of importance
to this department. For this purpose, the department has established an
interfaith committee on the ``RDP'' of the soul.'' This interfaith
committee assists the department in the fight against alcohol and drug
abuse, violence against women and children, and HIV-Aids in order to
restore the moral renewal of the people of the Northern Cape province.

In conclusion, it is clear that this department is tasked with serving the
most vulnerable people in society. The legacy of the past is still haunting
us. Reflecting on the situation of the beneficiaries on farms leaves me
with no alternative but to realise that, as Government, we need to ensure
legislation to enforce that farmers, miners and businesses in general are
liable for the retirement and injury on duty pay for their  workers.[Time

Mr N V E NGIDI (KwaZulu-Natal): Mr Chairperson, our budget and programmes
for community intervention must be advised by the need to lift our people
from the ravages and degradation of poverty. The Daily News of 12 May 1998
gave a graphic view of poverty in the country through the following
statistics: 53% live below the R301 per month poverty line, 87% of all
African children under 12 are nutritionally compromised and about 23% of
children under the age of six suffer from chronic malnutrition or stunting.


It is against this background that I discuss poverty alleviation
programmes. The question that must be asked is whether these programmes
really address social welfare needs. Are they directed at the correct
target, especially children who, because of their age, are no longer
covered by the child support grant? Have we developed mechanisms to monitor
these programmes? Is there adequate information available to enable people
to mobilise these programmes?

It must be said that our endeavours in information dissemination must allow
for extraordinary means because such is the unequal development in our
country that areas still exist where one has to use the most backward
methods of information dissemination.

I am raising these questions because I have been in contact with a number
of women who say that, in the past, they were covered by the maintenance
grant, but since this grant has been phased out, they have been left high
and dry with no means to support and maintain their children who are still
minors below the age limit set by the child support grant. There is either
not enough information to enable those in need to access these programmes
or there are serious bottlenecks in the implementation of these programmes.
Another area of consideration is the channels through which resources meant
for these programmes make their passage. Are these transparent and the
stages thereof clear? Would any person, irrespective of where the person
is, know where to go in order to access these resources? Are the people
charged with the task of ensuring that these resources reach their intended
destination motivated or sensitive to the plight of the poor people? What
are the structures of supervision and how do they operate?

Poverty alleviation is not our ultimate goal, but we should go beyond this.
It is poverty eradication that we should aim at. How do we then ensure that
poverty alleviation programmes are fully integrated into social development
programmes so as to begin to positively influence the lives of the poor?
Where is the connection? There must be a connection if we are to transform
the department from being a department giving hand-outs into a
developmental one.

Poverty does not only affect the lives of people, but it is a destabilising
factor. It has been characterised as the silent killer. We are unaware as
poverty wipes out communities. It rips asunder the moral fibre of any
nation and undermines the values that holds it together. It turns people
into scavenging and marauding animals who are cannibalising towards their
kith and kin. The bond of friendship and family, an important adhesive for
national unity, is greatly undermined. It is therefore imperative that, to
eradicate poverty, we go the extra mile, because poverty is our greatest
challenge. [Applause.]

Mev J WITBOOI: Mnr die Voorsitter, agb Minister, agb LUR'e en agb lede, ook
ek wil ons President aanhaal. Dieselfde aanhaling is ook in die Minister se
Begrotingsrede in die Nasionale Vergadering op 18 April 2000. Ek haal aan:


  ... at no other point in time have we ever been as well placed as we are
  today to take decisive forward steps towards the creation of the humane
  and people-centred society for which the organisations that were unbanned
  10 years ago struggled for many decades.

Dit is wat die regeringsleier gesê het en daaruit maak ek die afleiding dat
ons nou die geleentheid gebied word om gemeenskappe te skep waar ons vir
mekaar omgee.

Hierdie edel woorde word daagliks geëvalueer deur die miljoene hulpelose
mense daar buite, mense wat met kinderlike afwagting geglo het dat hulle
swaarkry, hongerlyding en bedelstand ná die 1994-verkiesing tot 'n einde
sou kom. Vandag kry ons as lede van hierdie Huis weer die geleentheid om te
kyk in watter mate ons daarin kon slaag om aan die armoede in ons land
aandag te gee.

Kom ons begin by ons bejaardes; daardie weerlose groep mense wat steeds in
die tyd waarin ons leef die prooi van genadelose mense is. Die meeste van
hierdie gewetenlose misbruikers van ons bejaardes se pensioentoelaes is
hulle eie families wat die sorgbehoewendes vergesel na die pensioentoelae
betaalpunte om op die skamele bedraggies beslag te lê.

Ook kry ons diegene wat die ou mense op hulle terugtogte inwag met
invorderingsboekies om hulle drankskuld te delg. Tragies maar waar is ook
die feit hierdie euwel nog steeds dwarsdeur die land voortduur en in baie
gevalle steur die gemeenskappe hulle nie daaraan nie of hulle is magteloos
om iets daaraan te doen.

Die Nuwe NP wil vandag 'n pleidooi lewer dat die Regering hom hard sal
uitspreek teenoor hierdie tipe vergrype aan bejaardes se pensioentoelaes,
en ons is dankbaar teenoor die Minister vir die feit dat hy genoem het dat
ons 'n verslag hieroor afwag.

Daar is ook 'n ander aspek wat ek vandag onder die Huis se aandag wil
bring. Mense probeer die persepsie daar buite vestig dat dit slegs die ANC
is wat aandag aan ons behoeftes gee. Ek wil dit vandag in hierdie Huis noem
dat dit van alle waarheid ontbloot is. In Citrusdal, waar ek vandaan kom,
het 'n groep vroue hulle in so 'n mate in die lot van bejaardes ingeleef
dat hulle met die hulp van vele vriende eiehandig woonstelle vir die
armstes onder die armes opgerig het.

Sonder die hulp van die staat het die vroue bykans drie jaar lank onverwyld
geswoeg om huisvesting te bied aan sorgbehoewende manne en vroue wat winter
en somer onder brûe en onder bosse geslaap het. Vandag bly hulle in hul
nuwe tuiste, Heuwelrus. Hulle het lopende water, ligte en sanitasiegeriewe,
en hulle is verlos van mense wat soos aasvoëls op hulle toesak op
uitbetaaldag. Maklik was dit vir hierdie vroue nie. Daar was erge
teenkanting teen hulle strewe om aan hierdie mense 'n beter oudag te bied.

Wat dit egter skokkend maak, is dat die grootste teenstand gekom het van
die ANC-leiers in Citrusdal. Hulle wou nie deel wees van hierdie pragtige
projek nie. Hulle alleen sal die antwoorde ken waarom nie. Vandag is hulle
skaam, want die eerste ouma wat haar woonstelletjie betrek het, is die ouma
van 'n prominente ANC-lid op Citrusdal. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die Nuwe NP salueer die vele vrywillige werkers dwarsdeur die landÿ.ÿ.ÿ.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek weet agb lede is geskok. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons weet
agb lede is geskok. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ons was ook geskok. [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, hon MECs and hon members, I too
would like to quote our President. The same quotation is also in the
Minister's Budget speech in the National Assembly on 18 April 2000. I
quote:


  ... at no other point in time have we ever been as well placed as we are
  today to take decisive forward steps towards the creation of the humane
  and people-centred society for which the organisations that were unbanned
  10 years ago struggled for many decades.
This is what the Government leader said and from this I come to the
conclusion that we are now given the opportunity to create communities
where we care for each other.

These noble words are evaluated daily by the millions of helpless people
out there, people who believed with childlike expectation that after the
1994 election their suffering, hunger and begging will come to an end.
Today we, as members of this House, once again have the opportunity to see
to which degree we succeeded in devoting attention to the poverty in our
country.

Let us begin with the elderly; this vulnerable group of people who are
still in this era in which we are living the prey of merciless people. Most
of these unscrupulous abusers of the pension grants of our elderly are
their own families who accompany the indigent to pay-points for pension
grants to lay claim on that meagre amount.

There are also those who wait for the old people on their way back with
recovery books so that they could settle their drinking debts. The tragic,
but true fact is that these evils perpetuate throughout the country and in
many instances the communities do not take any notice of it or are unable
to do anything about it.

The New NP wants to appeal today that the Government will take a harsh
stand against this type of offence of taking the pension grants of the
elderly and we are grateful to the Minister for the fact that he mentioned
that we are awaiting a report in this regard.

There is also another aspect which I would like to bring to the attention
of the House today. People try to create the perception out there that it
is only the ANC who devotes attention to our needs. I would like to mention
in this House today that that is devoid of all truth. In Citrusdal, where I
come from, a group of women felt the fate of the elderly to such a degree
that with the help of many friends they themselves, with their own hands,
built flats for the poorest of the poor.

Without the aid of the state, the women toiled without delay for almost
three years to provide housing to indigent men and women who slept under
bridges and bushes during winter and summer. Today they live in their new
home, Heuwelrus. They have running water, lights and sanitation facilities,
and they are rid of people who mob them like vultures on payday. It was not
easy for these women. There was much resistance against the desire to
present these people with a better old age.

However, what makes it shocking, is that the greatest resistance came from
the ANC leaders in Citrusdal. They did not want to be part of this
beautiful project. They alone will know the answers why not. Today they are
ashamed, because the first grandmother who moved into her flatlet, is the
grandmother of a prominent ANC member in Citrusdal. [Interjections.]

The New NP salutes the many voluntary workers throughout the country ...
Interjections.] I know hon members are shocked. [Interjections.] We know
hon members are shocked. [Interjections.] We were also shocked.
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order, hon members,
order! [Interjections.]

Mrs J WITBOOI: Die Nuwe NP ... [The New NP ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Order! Could
you take your seat, hon Witbooi. [Interjections.] On what point are you
rising, hon member?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

An HON MEMBER: She cannot!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Okay, let me
deal with that first. I will come back to you. Yes, what is it?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Are you prepared to
take a question?

Mrs J WITBOOI: No!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Thank you. She will
not take a question. [Interjections.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I want to know whether it is parliamentary
for an hon member to tell another member `` ... om sy bek te hou''. [to
shut his trap.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Who said that?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: The hon member right here.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: [Inaudible.] [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, op 'n punt van orde ... [Mr
Chairman, on a point of order ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Yes, hon member. Are
you rising on another point of order?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, is dit parlementêr om 'n leuen in
hierdie Huis te vertel? [Mr Chairman, is it parliamentary to tell a lie in
this House?]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Mr Van Niekerk, can
we deal with the point of order first? We did not hear what she said, and
she says she did not say what you say she said. So we are not able to make
any ruling in the absence of any record.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mnr die Voorsitter, kan ons Hansard vra om net die
opname na te gaan? [Mr Chairman, can we ask Hansard to check this
recording?]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): If there is a
translation of that, yes. Hon member, could you proceed.

Mev J WITBOOI: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP salueer die vele vrywillige
werkers dwarsoor die land wat gestalte gee aan ons President se oproep tot
gemeenskapdiens aan die talle behoeftiges. Die punt wat ek vandag hier wil
beklemtoon, is dat aan elkeen, ongeag ras of kleur, wat meehelp om die lot
van andere te verlig erkenning gegee moet word.

As die tyd my sal toelaat, wil ek 'n pleidooi lewer ten opsigte van die
kindertoelae. Laat ons weer kyk na die regeringsbeleid ten opsigte hiervan.
Die vermindering van die toelae aan kinders wanneer hulle die ouderdom van
sewe bereik, het drakoniese gevolge. 'n Kind se uitgawes raak méér sodra hy
op sewejarige ouderdom skool toe gaan, en 'n skamel geklede en honger kind
kan nie vorder nie.

Ons mag ons oë nie sluit vir hierdie weerloses wat omstandigheidsgevalle is
nie. President Mbeki het gesê dat die struggle baie dekades lank gevoer is
om ons nou in 'n posisie te plaas om na ons mense om te sien.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Gelag.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs J WITBOOI: Mr Chairman, the New NP salutes the many voluntary workers
throughout the country who give effect to our President's appeal to render
community service to the many indigent. The point which I would like to
highlight today, is that everyone, irrespective of race or colour, who
contributes to alleviating the fate of others, should receive recognition.

If the time will allow me, I would like to make an appeal in respect of the
child grants. Let us look again at the Government's policy in this respect.
The reduction of the grant given to children once they reach the age of
seven, has draconic results. The expenses of a child increase as soon as he
goes to school at the age of seven, and a scantily clad and hungry child
cannot make progress.

We may not shut our eyes to these vulnerable ones who are victims of
circumstances. President Mbeki said that the struggle was fought for many
decades so as to place us in a position where we can take care of our
people now. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Order! Hon
members, I will not stop this hon member if you interrupt her.

Mrs J WITBOOI: Die struggle is verby. Waarom moet ons nou nog ly?
[Tussenwerpsels.] [The struggle is over. Why must we continue to suffer?
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon members,
this is not a beer hall, please. [Laughter.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, allow me to start off by
expressing my sincere condolences to the hon Mr Makoela from my province
who has, in quick succession, lost three members of his family: His
brother, his nephew and his sister. As a consequence, he is unable to
attend this Budget Vote debate.

There are those members who are not ready to see or to hear the progress
made by the Government. So let us not give them an opportunity to retard
us. Let us progress.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

Mrs C NKUNA: Secondly, I would like to make a comment on the R20 issue. The
R20 increase does not create any difference to a person who has had it
comfortable before ...

Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

Mrs C NKUNA: ... but to a person from a rural area and to a person who has
been excluded in the past, and, again, looking at the budget and at the
number of pensioners that are supposed to be taken on board, R20 does make
a big difference. [Applause.]

Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!
Mrs C NKUNA: Our province has wholeheartedly embraced the delivery of
quality service to the most vulnerable in our community. Improved service
delivery is evidenced by the sterling example set by the pension committee
in my province. The committee has played a vital role in our Operation
Dignity campaign. For those who are not aware of it, this campaign was
launched in November 1999 and is aimed primarily at restoring dignity to
the most vulnerable sectors of our community, namely the elderly and the
disabled.

I would like to mention that a good government is judged by the manner in
which it treats its senior citizens and by the manner in which it treats
its disabled persons. Even though we are busy trying to restore the dignity
of our senior citizens, we still carry them in wheelbarrows from their
homesteads to the pension pay points. Where is the dignity of such a
person? It is for us and the Ministry to address this issue.

By now, we might have all either heard about or watched a programme on
Carte Blanche, dealing with the abuse of the elderly. But even if we have
not had the reports of our aged dying in queues while waiting for their
pensions, this has hit the headlines often enough.

We believe that this project has helped to establish humane conditions at
pay points. We also believe that we have, at least, made our public
servants aware that they must treat all people making use of the service
they provide with the dignity they deserve. We are looking forward to
seeing this campaign replicated throughout the country.

In this regard, I need to make mention of the fact that some of our
beneficiaries have had to be very patient with the provincial Department of
Welfare so that it could reinstate those beneficiaries who had been
erroneously removed from the welfare system during the clean-up campaign.
The situation has been rectified. We in the province will assist the
department in monitoring the situation so that it does not recur.

With regard to poverty alleviation, our province, more so than other
provinces, has enormous challenges posed by poverty, and the example I
mentioned earlier of taking an elderly person to a pay point in a
wheelbarrow is another sign of poverty. It does not mean that the
Government is not delivering.

We, together with the national Department of Welfare, need to look for
innovative and creative ways in which we can revamp our poverty alleviation
programmes. Here I am thinking especially of those poverty alleviation
initiatives such as community-based nutrition programmes and primary school
nutrition. With the latter, we have been able to create a situation
conducive to learning.

With regard to programmes and community self-help projects, we want to
encourage the Department of Welfare to channel all the necessary resources
to where they belong, that is, with the poor in our community.

The national Department of Welfare need not think that this fight against
poverty is exclusively theirs. Indeed, it is a fight that all of us,
including business, NGOs, community-based organisations and faith-based
organisations are prepared to share, and we will not hesitate to direct the
national department to where the needs are in our province.

We need to sit down and discuss what the criteria are to access the funding
and then empower our communities, through education, to gain this access.
There should be no need at all for poverty alleviation funds to remain
unspent. Some of these discussions have already taken place, and I am sure
that partnership will develop soon between the Department of Welfare and
Population Development and NGOs, faith-based organisations and
intergovernmental departments. I am also sure that the 101 poverty
alleviation projects and the 55 new projects underway in my province would
not mind the competition that new poverty alleviation funding would bring.

As far as applications for social security grants are concerned, the
Northern Province has, in the past, experienced serious backlogs, but we
are happy to report that a central data capturing centre was established to
address all backlogs. All 60 000 child support grants were captured, which
was our provincial target. New pay points were identified, and we now have
about 400 000 social security beneficiaries that were paid out across all
grant types.

In addition to this, our provincial department has put in place the
necessary administrative systems to ensure that any pensioner who applies
for a grant gets it within three months, within the limits of available
resources. We have set a target for child support grants at R130 000 for
the year 2000-01. Given the success of our recruitment campaign, I am
confident that our province will reach this target. We have already
budgeted for an addition of about 70 000 children in the 2001 budget.

Our province, along with Mpumalanga and the other affected provinces, has
been heavily hit by the floods in February this year. This was and
continues to be a very trying time for us, especially where roads and
bridges were washed away, houses crumbled and people were cut off from food
resources. Some areas in my province have even been declared disaster areas
by the President.

During this disaster, the Department of Welfare proved itself equal to the
task of dealing with disasters. Out of the Welfare budget, 8 067 food
parcels at the cost of about R1 million were purchased, and an additional 1
600 food parcels were purchased out of the provincial disaster relief fund.
Social workers were actively involved in identifying and accessing cases of
need and provided much counselling for those who needed it. In the face of
adversity, one's character is tested to its limits, and during this
disaster, the Department of Welfare, the SANDF, health workers and the
community at large showed a great deal of commitment.

(Translation of Tsonga paragraph follows.)

[Hon Chairperson, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity
to represent the Northern Province, and to say a few words to our leader
who is present here today. We from the Northern Province have pledged to
work hand in hand with him so that when, at the end of the day, a person
like me becomes aged, as he will too, those who are younger than us will be
able to take care of us in the same way as we manage to take care of our
aged of both sexes at present. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr P G QOKWENI: Chairperson, hon Minister, MECs and members, we support
this Budget Vote in full recognition of the millions of destitute South
Africans who cannot survive without social welfare services in the rural
and urban areas. We are engaged in this debate, motivated by a desire to
improve the lives of our masses and create a world-class nation. In doing
this, we have to contend with the harsh realities of life in South Africa,
as one of the most unequal countries in the world in racial and geographic
terms.

Those situated in the rural areas suffer the worst hardships, many of them
still living below the minimum household subsistence level. Their distances
from the main service centres and the lack of communication networks reduce
their access to information, including the information that is essential to
their livelihood. This means that we must make extra effort to communicate
the policies, programmes and grants that we offer, so that the intended
beneficiaries actually take advantage of the benefits to reduce poverty and
inequalities. I have in mind the example of the child support grant. I
found that many in our communities did not know about this at one time. We
need documents such as birth certificates and identity documents to pre-
empt corruption and promote clean and effective administration.

UMphathiswa uyayazi le nto kuba isinqe sakhe siseDikeni, kwesikaNdlambe.
Wayesakuthi uNozamile, waqala ukuva inimba ngoBhesengile, xa ooGaseti
nooNathawu babevela kuhlamba ingceke esizibeni, bephuma ethontweni ngonyaka
weentlumayo. [Uwele-wele.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The Minister is aware of this because his place of birth is Alice, the
land of amaNdlambe. Nozamile used to say that she felt, for the first time,
the pangs of childbirth with Bhesengile, when Gaseti and Nathawu returned
from washing off the clay at the river pool as they came out of the
traditional hut of the initiation school in the year when the cowpeas grew
in abundance.]

The impact of this on our processes will be felt long after we have put
modern measures in place to eliminate it. The officers who therefore call
for the documents must use a socially accountable and customer-centred
approach which conscientises them to deal with the members of the public
with empathy and in terms of the time standards set.

It is not good performance management which disregards the duration of the
task performed and the quality of the service delivery. We appreciate the
department's integration of the welfare systems to keep more reliable data
on beneficiaries and strengthen the management of social grants. However,
we must confront the fact that there are deserving beneficiaries who fell
out as we integrated, and that we must reinstate them.

The Minister has set up corrective measures to make the use of poverty
relief funds more efficient. Firstly, I would like to suggest that we
continue to monitor the distribution to ensure that the funds are given in
terms of the criteria laid down, and that partisanship does not influence
the choice of project beneficiaries, especially given the role of the
councillors in some of the allocation processes. Secondly, we must
capacitate not only the intermediaries, but also the beneficiaries,
especially in the rural areas where illiteracy levels are higher. Lastly,
we have oversight responsibilities as public representatives. These charge
us to monitor the implementation of these plans, so that when we are
confronted with failure to deliver, we understand that we also have to
accept our fair share of the blame, and not only the Minister or the
department alone. [Applause.]

Ms P C NGWENYA (Mpumalanga): Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs,
hon members and guests, it is a great pleasure for me to be given this
opportunity to address members on the policy review on social services and
population development. Firstly, I want to congratulate the Minister and
the MECs for the good work done in the Department of Welfare and Population
Development. Since this department is people-based, it has to make the
lives of our people better, especially those of the aged, the children, the
disabled and the women.

Concerning the management of social grants, we know and understand that
there is a social security section which deals with social grants, and
which has proved to be effective and efficient. They have established
pension committees to help to raise the concerns of the beneficiaries. The
training programme was in place for the committees to understand their
role.
The social grant needs to be marketed widely in all languages so that the
needy and deserving previously disadvantaged people can access the
information. The grants should be marketed extensively on radio which is
the best marketing vehicle for rural communities. Our constituency offices
and local councils should also be used to disseminate the information to
the communities. At all our meetings, social grants need to be an item on
the agenda.

The department is aware of the frustrations of people at different pay
points. We understand and know that the aged queue from morning to sunset.
However, the department will put in place a plan in order to try and
improve the services at the pay points by introducing smart cards, and the
aged will be trained on how to use those smart card. Shelters will be
erected in order to protect the aged from the sun and the rain. Working
with economic affairs, the department will establish village banks. They
will extend the pay dates in order to minimise the problem of long queues
and also establish other pay points if there is a need, so that the aged
need not travel long distances. The aged have to register a person they
trust to receive the grant on their behalf.

The department alone cannot manage this, but we as legislators need to play
a role. During our constituency period, we need to meet with the pension
committees and hear their concerns and visit the pay points during paydays
and monitor whether the services provided are according to the policy and
plans of the department.

Concerning fraud and corruption, we know and understand that fraud is still
a problem. However, the department has come up with a strategy to combat
this. The province is continuing with the reregistration of beneficiaries
and advocates for the development of the integration of the Government and
private sector system for screening applications for grants. Fraud units,
an anticorruption unit and the departmental investigation unit have been
established to deal with fraud and corruption. The department has also
developed a partnership with the SAPS, TLCs and community structures in
order to assist in rooting out fraud and corruption.

The integration of the 14 welfare systems into one has afforded all
citizens access to welfare services.

Concerning poverty alleviation, the province records a poverty rate of 57%
despite its contribution of 8,15% to the total GDP. An estimated amount of
R28 billion is required to close the poverty gap in South Africa. The most
affected areas are the former homelands and some rural farming communities.
Areas identified as poverty pockets are former Kangwane and KwaNdebele
which accommodate 51% of the total population of the province, of which,
coincidentally, 99% is African.

There is a relationship between poverty and the unemployment rate, which is
approximately 37%. The unemployment rate in the above-mentioned former
homelands is not less than 42%. The provincial department and the national
department are currently involved in the process of reviewing all the
poverty projects with the aim of developing a sustainable model of poverty
eradication. One hundred and eighty-six projects have benefited from the
R9,6 million allocated from the national budget for 1998-99. Of this, an
amount of R2 million is earmarked for the community empowerment pilot
project at Mjejane. The main thrust of this pilot project is to initiate a
large-scale poverty intervention project and develop indicators, and to
build up the skills and expertise of other departments and stakeholders.

Staff involved in the poverty alleviation programmes have been trained on
project management, and there are 16 cluster co-ordinators charged with the
development of income generation and financial management. The present
funding of poverty alleviation projects has been done through the national
department. The criteria for funding has been too restrictive for the
poorest of the poor communities to access these funds, due to the
requirements laid down by the national department.

Funding has also been disbursed through the national disbursement agency.
Recommendations have been made to the national department to allocate
funding to provinces' and that provinces should develop funding criteria
based on the needs and circumstances of the province. In this way, the
department will be able to provide funding to poor communities using
poverty pockets as a basis of targeting poverty alleviation projects.

With regard to HIV-Aids, orphans of this pandemic qualify for the foster
care grant. An amount of R13 million has been set aside by the national
department to be accessed to provinces. Tonga has been identified a pilot
site for the integrated approach, which encompasses home-based care,
voluntary testing and counselling, and life-skills training for schools and
outreach programmes. We have received recent statistics which reveal that
Schoemansdal has 705 children affected or infected. This information is
still being analysed by the department to determine how many children are
infected or affected. The department is continuing to provide support to
organisations involved in the development of home-based care projects in
Evander, Standerton, Malelane, White River, Witbank, KwaMhlanga and
Nkomazi.

Regarding the impact of HIV-Aids on the welfare system, the department has
developed home-based care and support for people living with HIV-Aids and
infected children, promoted voluntariness and community participation in
caring for people living with HIV-Aids, and provided counselling services
to people living with HIV-Aids. The impact will be very high on the welfare
budget as the number of affected people and the number of orphans to be
cared for increases. It is important that communities be sensitised in
providing home-based care for the orphans of HIV-Aids, so that as many
orphans as possible can benefit from social grants instead of becoming
institutionalised.

We need to take the issue of HIV-Aids seriously. While the department is
providing the home-based care, we need to have an awareness programme. We
need to join hands with churches, communities, NGOs, CBOs, student
organisations and other departments to conscientise people about HIV-Aids.
This will assist in minimising the number of deaths and orphans. I think
prevention is better than cure.

We also appreciate the support given by the department with regard to
educare centres. We understand that the department is providing nutrition
to children, while the Department of Education is responsible for the
payment of salaries for teachers. We need to note that the Department
cannot assist all the educare centres at once, but that it will be a
process. As legislators, we also need to visit those centres and monitor
whether children are getting food as expected.

We appreciate the phasing out of the state maintenance grant. This is a
good move, since only the minority group was benefiting from it. Currently
about 222 000 children are receiving the CSG grant. The target of the
Department of social services in Mpumalanga is to reach 210 000 children by
the year 2004. Again, we need to assist the department to reach its target
by informing the people about this grant, calling community meetings, and
assisting parents who have children under the age of seven to go and apply
for this grant. We must also make follow-ups of whether the grants are
received in time and as expected.

Some people are saying that there is no difference.

In conclusion, I want to say: onamehlo makabone; onezindlebe makezwe [those
who have eyes, must see; and those who have ears, must hear.] [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs from provinces, hon
members, when we speak about welfare, we include the wellbeing of everybody
- from an unborn baby who is still a fetus, to the senior citizen of
whatever age, as long as that individual is still alive. We also speak of
the welfare of all other living creatures, which may not be human beings,
and which fall under separate departments.

Today we are dealing with human beings, as I have mentioned, from the womb
to the cradle to the grave. I will repeat this - from the womb to the
cradle to the grave - otherwise there would be no antenatal or postnatal
health care services. [Interjections.] This means that this department is
entrusted with one of the most outstanding responsibilities of government.

To highlight what I have just said, I will start with the welfare of all
members of the community.

In the KwaZulu-Natal province, most people make a living by farming, either
on a small or large scale. This depends upon capacity and the availability
of land and finance. Without land and finance, nothing can be ventured
into. Naturally, our people are industrious. This can be traced from as far
back as the time of our ancestors. Most people cannot afford to cultivate
their land because of poverty, shortage of funds due to unemployment, and
joblessness. We appeal to the Department of Welfare to give the necessary
assistance to these people in order to enhance and promote their wellbeing
and economy.

Gardening is a well-known exercise by most citizens of this country, as I
have already mentioned. It is an old trade of our forefathers. People make
a living by cultivating land for various projects, for instance, planting
fruits and vegetables, sugar plantations and forestry. Support structures
that are available, such as servant support schemes should be effectively
utilised. There must be no strings attached in giving out this money,
because, one way or another, it could end up being misappropriated by
greedy individuals, while the children who need it have not benefited.

Regarding old age pension, people who qualify for pensions because of old
age must get this money for their wellbeing and survival. Some families
abuse their elders when it comes to the use of this money. We commend the
hon MEC in KwaZulu-Natal, the hon Prince J L Zulu, because we all know how
he successfully dealt with this notoriety in the province. He has explained
how many people are behind bars and so on. We really commend him for that.

Regarding the question of street children, street children in towns, cities
and suburban areas need love and care. The Department of Welfare should
have programmes to rehabilitate street children. Institutions should be
built where they can be supervised and given behaviour modification skills
in order to boost their morale and self-esteem to enable them to fight
against street crime and the drug addiction that they have completely
succumbed to.

People with specific skills should be financially assisted in order to
promote their work skills and trade by all means, so that their welfare and
wellbeing is catered for in the most appropriate manner possible. The IFP
supports the Budget Review. [Applause.]

Ms F J ADAMS (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs - my
colleagues - and members of this House, I would like to say thank you very
much, in the first instance, for just allowing me to take part in this
Budget Review debate of hon Minister Skweyiya.

I think, by now, it is common knowledge that for the next 10 to 15 years
the two most critical areas of concern that will dominate the global
platform for debate will definitely be HIV-Aids and, of course, poverty.
Until relatively recently, I must say, the issue of HIV-Aids has been dealt
with within a very unco-ordinated tunnel vision and erroneous assumption
that it is an issue that belongs only to the health department, and that
therefore it is only a health matter. But, from the outset I want to say
that that is not the prerogative of any department or institution to claim
that it is not someone else's problem, but the problem of all of us
collectively here. [Interjections.]

To fight this epidemic which, according to the last count - and these are
the stats that I actually got hold of - is blighting the lives ...
[Interjections] ... we actually call statistics stats in psychology.
[Interjections.] It is actually blighting the lives of almost 3 million
South Africans. All of us - Government organisations, the private sector,
community organisations, etc - need to embark on an all-year-round campaign
for at least the next 15 years.

I think that members will agree with me when I say that if HIV-Aids had
followed the same course as the Ebola virus - can members remember what
happened a few years back - which killed many people within three weeks.
Maybe - just maybe - perceptions and ignorance, and therefore behaviour,
regarding this silent invisible killing force could have changed much
earlier in our communities, our provinces and our country. [Interjections.]


Any government - and members will agree with me on that - that is
threatened by a visible destructive force at its borders will intervene and
stop such a force immediately if it knows that such a force is out to kill
almost half its women and children population. It would do everything in
its power to stop it. What would it do? Such a government or country would
mobilise all the citizen forces that it can lay its hands on. It would
purchase new military tanks and jet fighters and, above all, it might just
declare a national emergency. [Interjections.]

However, we know that our country is faced with the most lethal threat
which is not as visible as a military threat. But it is, indeed, eight
hundred trillion invisible, microscopic HIV viruses that are being produced
daily and spread to other victims, and which will definitely kill hundreds
of thousands of South African citizens. [Laughter.] Youth and children will
not be victims immediately, but within ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,
could you please take your seat. On what point are you rising hon member?

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, can the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Are you prepared to
take a question, hon member?

Ms F J ADAMS: Chairperson, I only have 10 minutes, and this is such a
serious matter that I cannot waste my time with questions. [Interjections.]
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! The hon member
is not prepared to take a question. Could the hon member please proceed.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Ms F J ADAMS: Mr Chairperson, I want to repeat ...

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: This shows how old
this Council is. But can I just remind members that a colleague is making
her maiden speech. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! What is your
point of order?

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I just think that colleagues should take
that into account. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! That is not a
point of order!

Ms F J ADAMS: Chairperson ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Could you take
your seat until they are quiet. Take your seat, and when they are quiet,
you will speak.

Ms F J ADAMS: Chairperson, I just hope that my 10 minutes have not run out.


I just want to remind members once again that that killing force does not
act immediately, but will do so within the next 10 years when this virus,
at the end of the day, would have manifested itself into Aids. Even worse,
the number of full-blown Aids cases amongst our young girls between the
ages of 15 to 24 years, is horrific. Why do I say it is horrific? It is
because it means - and I want the community leaders and all our political
leaders to please listen - that our young girls have become HIV-positive at
the early age of between eight and 15 years. This means that the level of
child sex in South Africa has, in itself, reached endemic proportions. Why
are we then not vocal enough about the rights of the non-HIV-Aids-positive
young girls, and the fact that having sex with them is not only a
fundamental violation of their innocence, but also that it should be
classified as murder.

I am very happy to observe that the hon Minister, the Government and all
institutions are no longer giving this epidemic scant interest, but are, in
fact, collectively rising to the challenge in order to engage and fight
this epidemic and contain its spread. The fact is that this pandemic, apart
from many others in the history of the world or South Africa, and also of
our provinces, is concentrated in young adult populations and that there
has been a steady increase in the number of infected young women in all our
provinces in the past five years. Let me remind the hon Chairperson and hon
Minister about this by quoting somebody. This time I am going to quote from
the hon Mr Mandela's 1994 inauguration speech when he said, and could hon
members please listen:


  The youth of our country are valued possessions of our nation. Without
  them there can be no Reconstruction and Development Programme; without
  them there can be no future.

However, why on earth is there still too much apathy and so much silence
about the sexual abuse of our young children and our youth? The perception
out there is that this silence extends to some part of the legal
fraternity, some of our powerful leaders, politicians, church leaders and
community leaders - these are the perceptions that exist out there. Of
course, I commend those leaders, politicians and other concerned role-
players who are committed to involving themselves in and dedicating
themselves to combating, preventing and containing the spread of HIV-Aids.

The legal and ethical issues have already been raised here - I will not go
into that. But I must stress specific areas of focus, including the legal
status of the HIV-Aids sufferer, the consent required for testing for HIV-
Aids, the question of anonymity and confidentiality and many others. We as
provincial government rededicate ourselves, in front of our colleagues in
all the other provinces and in the national Government, to collectively
working with all other spheres of government, NGOs, church groups and other
Aids-combating agencies and institutions to eradicate the scourge of HIV-
Aids in our provinces and our country.

Members will agree with me that there is definite causality and link
between HIV-Aids and poverty. Members will also agree with me when I say
that one of the greatest symptoms of poverty, which has already been stated
here, is unemployment. Unemployment manifests itself in various other forms
such as a decline in moral standards, which we heard about this afternoon
here, wife battering, domestic violence, increasing crime, rape, child
abuse, murder, and substance abuse such as alcohol and drug dependence.

These are the realities that we are faced with in our province. I can only
speak for our province and, I think, for our country.

One of the primary focuses of the department of social services in the
Western Cape is the forging of partnerships with strategic partners and
various other developmental initiatives with regard to poverty relief
programmes. An example of such a mechanism available to us is the poverty
relief and investment programme. Currently, funding for antipoverty
strategies is available from the provinces in the form of capacity-building
funds, flagship programme funds, multipurpose centre funds and various
subsidies for early childhood development and other services.

This is in addition to the social security grant programme which in itself
constitutes a massive antipoverty fund. The poverty relief and
infrastructure investment programme differ from other funding because the
funds do not flow through the province, but are dispatched through the IDT
- a support agency of the national Department of Welfare. The new funding
policy explicitly states that Government must shift from being a funder of
welfare services to a purchaser of relevant and appropriate welfare
services.

Important issues that the branch needs to concern itself with - and we are
committed to do so - are the following: an analysis of the living
conditions of the focus groups in order to target them more efficiently,
with the aim of delivering more effective services; their developmental
priorities ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M L Mushwana): Order! Hon member,
you have exhausted even your one and a half extra minutes for your maiden
speech. [Laughter.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MECs, hon members, I do not
know if the audience is going to listen to me after such a long good
lecture. [Interjections.] I would like to quote the following:


  Poverty is pain, it feels like a disease, it attacks a person not only
  materially, but also morally. It eats away one's dignity and drives one
  into total despair.

A poor woman called Moldova said these words.

Deep class and racial divisions mark South Africa's legacy of apartheid.
While 40% of the total population is income poor, the percentage for black
South Africans is 60%. Almost three quarters of the poor live in woefully
underdeveloped rural areas. Many people lack adequate housing and access to
basic social services. The democratic governments elected since 1994 have
placed poverty and inequality at the centre of their development agendas.

South Africa's antipoverty policies, which were part of its RDP, began in
1996 in order to engineer growth through increased public expenditure on
such items as housing, electricity, water, education and health. Since
then, antipoverty policies have been more explicitly incorporated in Gear,
which rallies on market-led growth in order to increase the resources for
redistribution.

Poverty is a multidimensional problem requiring comprehensive multisectoral
programmes linked to national policy-making. South Africa is one of the few
countries which cater for poverty reduction through its regular Government
budget. The Department of Finance has also set up a special poverty relief
fund which will be able to mobilise some external resources. Other
Government departments can obtain resources from the fund only if they have
already made their budgets pro-poor. This arrangement increases incentives
for a greater focus on poverty in all Government programmes.

In per capita terms, South Africa is an upper-middle-income country. But
despite this relative wealth, the experience of most South African
households is of outright poverty or of continuing vulnerability to being
poor. The distribution of income and wealth in South Africa is among the
most unequal in the world, and many households still have unsatisfactory
access to education, health care, energy and clean water.

The ANC Government is committed to eradicating poverty and closing the gap
between the rich and the poor. The ANC Government puts priority on
addressing the lack of access to basic social services. A total of 4,5
million people have gained access to potable water and more than 600 000
inexpensive houses are under construction. Today we have a free and
compulsory ten-year education for our children and free medical care for
pregnant women and children under six years of age. There has also been
progress in providing secure land tenure to labour tenants who where
previously subjected to arbitrary and unfair evictions.

I want to remind my colleagues that some of us here today created poverty
in this country with inhuman policies. Some of us are still benefiting from
the fruits of those policies to the detriment of the majority of the
citizens.

The ANC believes that the fight against poverty can be won by bearing the
following in mind. Economic growth and human development are linked. To
achieve a better life for all, the capabilities of disadvantaged
communities, households and individuals should be advanced. Government
should increase the emphasis on redistribution measures. Government needs
to be more assertive in facilitating the transfer of assets and services
from the wealthy to the poor, matched by market, institutional and spatial
reforms benefiting the less well-off.

In conclusion, as the ANC Government we will strive to make growth more pro-
poor. We will continue to target inequality at all levels and we will
empower the poor. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR WELFARE AND POPULATION DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chairperson,
first of all I would like to thank the hon members for their participation
in this debate, and the spirit of co-operation and helpfulness that has
been displayed by all parties concerned.

The issues that the department is dealing with are surely issues that face
the constituencies that elected us to this place, and as such we should
work together more in order to ensure that we do achieve what we have
promised the people who have put us in this place. More importantly, it is
our moral, and not only political, duty that we should ensure that the
people of South Africa do achieve the better life that we promised them.
This should not be done only on paper, but basically by us being involved,
individually and collectively, in ensuring that those rights and those
grants that are given by Government reach them.

If I say I speak on behalf of Government, I really mean that I speak on
behalf of all members, specifically the heads of departments and, more
importantly, the MECs from the provinces with whom we have been working
very closely in order to ensure that our mandate is carried out as fast as
possible. We have been working very closely as a team with the hope of
improving whatever there is so that the poorest of the poor can receive the
best that they can.

Of course there are problems that need to be resolved as fast as possible,
some of which we have inherited from the past. This is the case as the MEC
from the Eastern Cape, the hon Ncumisa Khondlo, has indicated here. Some of
the problems confronting the Eastern Cape at present are issues that come
directly from the past problems with the creation of a new province,
problems of the transformation of the Public Service and problems that
really need to be looked into, not only by the Government and public
servants but also by all political representatives in all spheres of
government in South Africa. We hope to work very closely with the provinces
in order to ensure that this does take place and that we improve our
quality of service and reach the poorest of the poor.

Surely, the other problems that have been raised here pertain to issues
that concern our role as members of Parliament. It is quite clear that in
so far as poverty relief is concerned we are working closely as a team, as
I have said earlier, with the MECs and with the Government in the
provinces. However, we need the individual and collective support of
members of Parliament. They need to monitor what we are doing, assist us
where there are problems and direct us where we are failing, one way or the
other. It does not help much for us, or others, to come here and complain
when we have the power - I repeat, we have the power - to make a change, to
make things move much better.

We are all servants of the people. We are paid by the taxpayer, and the
taxpayer, irrespective of whatever political party he or she may support,
expects something better because we are members of Parliament wherever we
are. So, in other words, I think it should not be left to the MECs or the
public servants alone. It should be left to the individual member, working
very closely with civil society and the churches to which members are
supposed to be going, even if they do not go - some members do not go - and
with the teams that exist outside, sportspeople, in order to ensure that
our people do get their grants every month.

At least, in each and every constituency it is the duty of members to know
who gets his or her grant, whether he or she got it this month or will get
it next week ...

... phaya eMpumalanga naphaya eEastern Cape. [... in Mpumalanga and in the
Eastern Cape.]

It is not a joke. It is a reality. That is the members' job, to serve the
people.

I know many members look down on welfare, thinking it has nothing to do
with them, it is for the poor people. But those are the people that put us
where we are at the present moment. Those are our bosses. We should be seen
to be serving them, individually and collectively.

Many issues have been raised here with regard to the question of district
surgeons. It is quite true. Some of the problems that exist in the Western
Cape, the Eastern Cape and the Northern Province concern these honourable,
learned gentlemen who are really not doing their jobs. They are public
servants. It is members' duty to tell them that they are public servants.
Members should call them to come and give account in the legislature,
before the portfolio committees on health and welfare, of what they are
doing, so as to ensure that people do get their disability grants and that
people are served. The way in which people are suffering at the present
moment is completely unacceptable.

With regard to poverty relief, the issue has been raised of whether there
is a need for poverty relief. Why should we not simply eradicate poverty? I
think we should be human and more practical. Poverty cannot go in one day,
nor can it go in 50 years' time. It has to be worked on. It takes time. The
main problem, as we all know, is not only the question of being poor, but
the question of unemployment. Many people would love to work if there were
jobs. Members know - I do not have to tell them -the problems we have here
as a result of globalisation. Theoretically one can run away and say
globalisation is an enemy. But it is there. It is a challenge and it also
provides opportunities for all of us. It is the way in which we engage
ourselves as South Africans and as a Government with that globalisation
process that we will enable us to resolve some of the problems that face
South Africa at the present moment.

So, also on the question of poverty we need to know exactly where these
projects are that receive the funds. As I have said, members should go to
their computers, get to the welfare website and they will find these
projects there. More importantly, I would appeal to members to go and find
out whether these projects exist. I am asking: Do they exist? Money might
have been sent to them, and even if they do exist, how is that money being
used? Does it reach our target? Those are the questions members ought to be
asking at the present moment, individually and collectively, also through
their churches. We are working with all the churches, all of them, and they
have agreed that they will work very closely with us. We are also working
with all faith-based organisations and the NGO sector. One has to work with
them and tell them that these are the problems that we are facing as
members of Parliament.

In so far as improvements at pay points are concerned, it is quite true
that there is a need for them. It is unacceptable - I repeat, unacceptable
- that our aged have to go through so much suffering whenever they go to
receive grants. Some of them receive their grants at pay points set up in
the veld without shelter. It has been said that some of them are carried on
wheelbarrows just to get their grants. Do they have to go through that?

What do we do as members of Parliament who know that so-and-so is entitled
to a grant? Why can we not help, one way or the other, to ensure that that
person gets his or her grant? Members should not forget that they are these
people's servants. They can be driving around in their Volvos, they can be
living in mansions, but in the final analysis the person who put them in
Parliament is the person who cannot get to a pay point, because he or she
is unable to. That is our job.

Regarding the question of the state maintenance grant, I think it has been
talked about for such a long time. I know it is a political issue,
particularly in the Western Cape and amongst minorities in general.
However, the reality is that money is not there. People should accept that.
This issue was used by the New NP to buy the support and votes of the
coloured minority at that time. [Interjections.] However, this Constitution
maintains that each and every individual should be treated equally, and
this state does not have the resources to treat everybody equally. Hence,
the child support grant was introduced so that the amount could be
distributed equally. Three years have passed since then - I want to repeat
this: three years have passed - so everybody should get the same amount and
it is ending this year. Everybody will get R100. We know it is not enough,
but everybody is getting it. People should accept that. It is a reality,
and will not change. Hon members should tell the people not to tell lies
and all these other things that I hear being said in the newspapers. This
reality is not going to change. Everybody must get something. The
Constitution which put us all here demands that. We cannot continue with
that amount. We all have to come to the level and then all grow up
together. Those are realities.

The question of reregistration is, quite obviously, a painful process. It
is a painful process, but it has been agreed to by each and every
individual and each and every political party. No political party can stand
up here and say that it agrees with the fraud that is going on. This is
painful, but in its application reregistration should be more humane. It
should consider the people concerned. It should be more humane than it is
at the present moment. The people we are dealing with are the poorest of
the poor and they need our support.

Regarding the question of Aids, it is quite obvious that we have to work
very closely with the NGO sector. We have to work even more closely with
local government, because, I think, local government has been running away
from this issue, seeing it as a question that concerns the national
Government and provincial governments. Local government should be involved
in the fight against Aids, the fight to ensure that people living with Aids
get more humane treatment than they do at the present moment.
Local government should work with us as national Government, with
provincial government, as well as with the NGO sector, to ensure that the
policies we are fighting for and the money that is there, that has been
given by provincial and national Government, is used with the resources
that local government has to ensure that our treatment of people living
with Aids becomes more humane than it is at the present moment.

Furthermore, although the issue of assessment of disability grants has been
touched on, I think we should go back to it. Again, as members of
Parliament, we should tell people that this disability grant, if it is not
a permanent one, is only meant for a year. Before the end of that year
beneficiaries should ensure that they go back to the district surgeon who
would be able to do what is necessary - whether one continues or not in
terms of being well or not. That is necessary. This should be explained to
beneficiaries, specifically if the grant is provided on a temporary basis.

Of course, in so far as the department is concerned, I think it is quite
clear that there are still problems, but there has been a vast improvement
this year. There is still room for more improvement, but I think everybody
is doing his or her best to ensure that we agree and will serve our people
much better than we are doing right now.

We have introduced the issue of capacity-building in different provinces.
At national level we have advertised the post of chief financial officer.
We have also completed a thorough review of our expenditure patterns, and
are putting in place a number of strategies to address underexpenditure. We
have presented a comprehensive report on this issue to the Public Accounts
Committee. We should not underestimate the enormous challenge of building
capacity in the national and provincial departments. I think there is this
tendency, from listening to the speeches made here. Hon members should
understand that one of the compromises that we made during the negotiations
was to keep the public service that we found under apartheid and the
Bantustan system. We should not run away from that fact. Hon members should
accept it. If they accept that fact then, naturally, they will find ways to
remedy it. The majority, specifically from the Bantustans, did not
necessarily have that capacity, and we are saddled with that at the present
moment. However, we should not underestimate the enormous challenge of
building capacity in both national and provincial government.

Last year 6 666 officials were trained across the country in project
management development, developmental social welfare and management, and we
need more. The national and provincial departments are working on a joint
human resource development strategy. We will not only focus on building
skills, but also on infusing the ethics of care into our officials. We
expect all of our officials to comply with the code of conduct for public
servants, and we have not hesitated to take disciplinary action against
those who transgress the code.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Minister, I am afraid your
speaking time has expired.

The MINISTER: To conclude, I would like to thank all members for what they
have done, and, in the final analysis, the job we are doing is our job and
not only mine. With due respect, Madam Chair, I have to sit down.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you. I have very strict instructions
from the Whippery with respect to speaking time, hon Minister. Thank you
for all of the debate.

Debate concluded.

                            MOTION WITHOUT NOTICE

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Before adjourning the House I would
like to deal with the question of the motion without notice that was
proposed by Mr Van Niekerk at our sitting this morning. During the sitting
Mr Van Niekerk proposed the move of a motion without notice. I deferred the
decision on the question in order to determine whether this House had
previously passed a similar motion. As members are aware, Rule 75(2)(a)
provides that:


  A draft resolution proposed for approval by the Council may not in
  substance be the same as a draft resolution which has been approved or
  rejected by the Council during the preceding six months.

I have studied the motion proposed by Mr Van Niekerk, as well as previous
motions passed by this House on the subject of language in South Africa. I
am satisfied that during the past six months this House has not passed a
similar motion to the one read out this morning. I will therefore proceed
to put the question with respect to the motion read out by Mr Van Niekerk.
Are there any objections to the motion being agreed to?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I want to raise a similar objection to that
motion.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! There is an objection. The motion will
therefore become a notice of motion.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:40.
                                 __________
