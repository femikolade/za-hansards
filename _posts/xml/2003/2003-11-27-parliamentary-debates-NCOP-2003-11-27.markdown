 SIXTEEN DAYS OF ACTIVISM: SOUTH AFRICA UNITED IN FIGHTING VIOLENCE AGAINST
                             WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Deputy Chair, before I say anything, are  all  members
wearing the white ribbon?

HON MEMBERS: Yes!

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Are you sure?

HON MEMBERS: Yes! [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Ukhona oomama ongayinxibanga? [Is there any woman  not
wearing it?] [Laughter.]

At  least  the  majority  is  wearing  it.  Thank  you  very  much.   Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP,  hon  members,  thank  you  for  affording  me  the
opportunity to interact with this House on such a crucial matter.

The issue of eradicating violence  and  abuse  directed  towards  women  and
children has seized the attention of our nation for a period of time now.  I
believe we should begin this debate  by  acknowledging  and  applauding  the
amount of work that has been done by all sectors to raise awareness  with  a
view to eradicating this scourge.

It is to the credit of our country that in the democratic era, this  serious
problem is no longer swept under the carpet, but  is  openly  discussed  and
confronted, no matter how painful it is. The first step towards  eradicating
such a social malady is through transparency. Through awareness  the  public
will be able to identify and report cases of abuse.

National awareness of the problem is long-standing. The public has,  in  the
recent past, had to come to terms with horrific cases of child abuse  -  one
infant having been as young as five months of age. We  were  revolted,  many
people were traumatised, but in the end we  all  resolved  to  roll  up  our
sleeves and do something to avoid a recurrence.

Similarly, the abuse of women is becoming recognised, not as a  domestic  or
internal matter as it used to be before 1994, but as a matter that  requires
family members, relatives, neighbours, and communities to condemn  and  take
action to stop it. Our criminal  justice  system  is  strengthened  by  such
assistance from the community.

This vigilance and determination to end this scourge is enhanced by  various
campaigns, including the one of 16 Days of Activism  launched  in  Kimberley
this week. This  campaign  is  aimed  at  further  promoting  awareness  and
galvanising all families, communities and indeed all sectors  to  action  in
support of this national task.

We are also encouraged by the fact that the Moral Regeneration  Movement  is
taking  root.  A  number  of  municipalities  and  provinces  have   already
established Moral Regeneration Movement structures,  and  this  will  locate
the campaigns to build caring societies firmly under this umbrella.

The participation of families, relatives and local communities  is  critical
in ending this plague, because we believe that such  acts  of  violence  and
abuse are perpetrated not by strangers, but by people known to the victims.

I believe, Madam Chairperson ... Deputy Chairperson, sorry about  trying  to
change you into the opposite sex. [Laughter.]

I believe that  as  public  representatives  we  have  a  responsibility  to
promote  this  campaign,  and  to  work  within   our   constituencies   and
communities to bring an end to these despicable acts, going  beyond  the  16
Days of Activism to every day of each year.

As we head for the tenth year of the anniversary of our democracy,  we  also
acknowledge  the  excellent  work  that  Parliament  has  done  in   passing
legislation that promotes the rights, security  and  comfort  of  women  and
children.

The Domestic Violence Act, for instance, was passed in Parliament  in  1998,
and through this Act women are afforded greater  protection  against  actual
or threatened physical violence and  sexual,  emotional,  verbal  and  other
abuses. It also protects women against intimidation,  stalking,  harassment,
and damage to or destruction of their property, or entry  into  their  homes
without their consent.

Also recognising the responsibility of fathers to maintain  their  children,
Parliament  enacted  the  Maintenance  Act  to  bring  about  a  number   of
significant  improvements  in  the   maintenance   system,   including   the
appointment of maintenance investigators.

On other fronts, the SA Children's  Charter  and  various  other  pieces  of
legislation aimed at protecting children's and women's  rights  are  further
supported by Chapter 9 institutions,  including  the  Commission  on  Gender
Equality, the Public Protector and the Human Rights Commission.

Also soon to be passed in Parliament is  the  Sexual  Offences  Bill,  which
will broaden the definition of ``sexual violence'' and further  ensure  that
convicted perpetrators receive the maximum penalty from the state.  I  would
like to urge members of Parliament to monitor the  implementation  of  these
laws, to ensure that they achieve the intended objectives.

In the next decade of our freedom, we intend  to  continue  our  efforts  to
make our country one that is not only protective of women and children,  but
that continues to work tirelessly to  engender  a  culture  of  respect  and
dignity for women and children as part of building a caring society. We  are
convinced that the majority of South Africans share these ideals.

I  would  like  to  urge  hon  members,  as  Parliament  adjourns  for   the
constituency  period  and  festive  season,   that   we   individually   and
collectively encourage all citizens in our constituencies to participate  in
the 16 days campaign, encouraging awareness that extends  to  every  day  of
the year. Working together, we can make a difference. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, hon Deputy President, this debate fits in  quite
well with our committee's report on the provincial tours that  we  undertook
to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Domestic  Violence  Act  and  the
Maintenance Act, which were debated in this House the day before yesterday.

It has always been the mandate of the Joint Monitoring Committee on  Quality
of Life and Status of Women to oversee and monitor any  and  all  situations
that deal with the preservation of human rights of women and to unite  South
Africa in fighting violence against women and children. This is one  of  the
cornerstones of our committee's activities.

Our  Government,  by  participating  in  this   programme,   is   not   only
demonstrating that it aligns itself with the past 10  years'  activities  by
marking the 16 days of activism taking place around the world to end gender-
based violence, but we are also  unambiguously  articulating  that  we  will
play our part to raise awareness in the global campaign for  the  protection
of survivors of  violence  and  the  elimination  of  all  forms  of  gender
violence.

Make Sihlalo, likhaya akusilo likhaya nalite make. Likhaya  akusilo  likhaya
nalite bantfwana. Kwentiwa yini kutsi sihlukumete bomake  kanye  nebantfwana
betfu? [Madam Chairperson, a home is not a home if there  is  no  mother.  A
home is not a home if there are no children. Why are women and  children  so
much abused?]

The  25th  of  November,  when  we  started  the  campaign,   was   declared
International Day of No Violence Against Women in 1981. This day was  chosen
to commemorate  the  death  of  the  Mirabal  sisters  in  1960  during  the
dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic.

The three Mirabal sisters were tortured, raped and killed by the police  for
their opposition to the Trujillo regime. The day was  officially  recognised
by the United Nations in 1999 as the International Day for  the  Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

Within our  own  country's  borders,  among  every  single  race  group  and
religious  denomination,  we  struggle  against  years  of  oppression   and
subjugation to change the mindset of not only our brothers, fathers,  uncles
and sons but also the submissiveness of our sisters and mothers.  How  often
have we experienced repeated beatings taking place in our own families.

Ngiyakhumbula kuleliviki lelendlulile, kumabonakudze,  Mgcinisihlalo,  kutsi
bekunemfana lowavela kumabonakudze asho atsi ngakhulela ngaphansi  kwemphilo
lenjena yekuhlukumeta. Ngabonela kubabe wami ashaya make wami.

Nami-ke ngatsatsa ngekutsi nguyona mphilo lekufanele ngiphile ngayo.  Ngatsi
nami  nase  ngikhulile  ngabe  sengilingisa  yena  babe  wami  kantsi   loku
lengikwentako akusiyo intfo lelungile. Kanjalo  ngitsi  asibambaneni  sonkhe
silwe nalobudlova lobungenile emiphakatsini, kusho lomfana. (Translation  of
Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[I remember last week, there was a boy who  appeared  on  television  saying
that he grew up under such abusive conditions. He said that he also used  to
see his father beat his mother.

The boy thought it was the normal way of living. He  also  said  that  as  a
grown-up man, he treated his wife like his father treated  his  mother,  yet
he did not know that what he was doing was not  the  right  thing.  The  boy
urged all the communities to work together against women and child abuse  in
their communities.]

Often the victim takes the blame for the action and seeks  to  find  excuses
to explain away the behaviour of the perpetrator. There is even an  increase
in family killings, where the husband makes a decision to kill every  single
member of his family.
In our communities when there is a robbery  and  a  woman  is  the  targeted
victim, the robbery is often also accompanied by rape,  the  worst  kind  of
violation of a woman. The  woman  in  this  situation  therefore  becomes  a
victim twice over.

Increasingly children are also at the receiving end of  abuse  or  rape.  We
have had quite a few  cases  in  recent  years  of  baby  rape,  where  even
suckling infants are  not  exempted  from  the  brutal  violation  of  their
bodies. Across our continent and in every  war  situation  worldwide,  women
and children are rounded up in war camps and abused in  more  ways  than  we
can even begin to imagine.

South Africa, therefore, has a moral and  social  obligation  which  it  has
exercised since 1998 to increase  awareness  of  the  negative  impact  that
violence against women has on our society.  The  Office  on  the  Status  of
Women, the Office on the Status of Children and the Office on the Status  of
Disabled  Persons,   together   with   the   Department   of   Justice   and
Constitutional Affairs and  the  national  gender  machinery,  that  is  the
Commission on Gender Equality, have shown great leadership  in  spearheading
our own 16  Days  of  Activism  which  will  incorporate  the  International
HIV/Aids Day on 1 December and an International Day for the  Disabled  on  3
December.

The programme is there for all the provinces. I also urge members that  when
they go back to their constituencies they  must  also  join  the  programmes
that are being planned in each province. Indeed, the call to all  businesses
and civil society, whether NGOs, CBOs, sports or religious organisations  to
enthusiastically participate in the 16 Days  of  Activism,  illustrates  the
gravity with which our Government  views  the  need  to  stem  the  tide  of
violence against women and children.

All spheres of Government have been encouraged to consult  with  the  gender
focal  points  in  each  department  and  departmental  clusters  so  as  to
participate in the White Ribbon  campaign.  The  erection  of  the  Wall  of
Solidarity and numerous other awareness  programmes  that  will  take  place
throughout the country will conclude in Parliament on 10 December.

As the ANC we are proud that we have  a  government  that  continues  to  be
focused on improving the lives of all our women, children and the  disabled,
despite all negative criticism. We are especially proud that  the  awareness
programmes are elevating the  role  of  men  and  boys,  inspiring  them  to
protect their sisters, mothers and loved ones  from  being  the  targets  of
rapists and abusers. I want to encourage ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, Minister,  Deputy  President,  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP and hon members, the abuse of women and children is not limited to  the
act of abuse alone but extends to the choice by those  who  know  about  the
abuse to remain silent.

Abuse of any sort is a crime whether or  not  the  abuser  is  a  friend,  a
partner or a family member. Silence about abuse is  almost  as  bad  as  the
abuse itself. Choosing silence is choosing to allow the cycle  of  abuse  to
be repeated.
The New NP believes that the safety and security of our women  and  children
of South Africa is non-negotiable. That is why the New NP  supports  and  is
actively promoting the creation of a  sexual  offenders  register,  which  I
believe the Department of Justice is busy looking  into;  more  funding  for
civil society and NGOs - even if the DA criticises everything, I  think  the
Government will still carry on its work;  greater  awareness  of  protection
orders; more victim-friendly courts; and harsher possible sentencing.

The Government, the police and the courts alone can never solve the  problem
of abuse. Every woman or child that is  protected  is  a  victory,  but  the
fight will only be over when our women and children are safe.

Die gemeenskappe moet 'n ondersteunende rol  speel,  veral  wat  betref  die
mishandeling van vroue of kinders. Kom ons vat hande en  werk  saam  om  die
probleem hok te slaan en veral ten opsigte van die  Regering  se  programme.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[The communities must play a  supporting  role,  especially  concerning  the
abuse of women and children. Let us join hands and work  together  to  crack
down  on  the  problem  and  especially  with  regard  to  the  Government's
programmes.]

In conclusion, I want to say that the more people choose  to  speak  out  to
expose those criminals, the sooner we will win  the  battle  against  abuse.
Let us make a choice to speak out in these 16 days and as long  as  we  live
to fight abuse. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Hon Chairperson,  Deputy  President,  Deputy  Minister,  at  the
heart of our Constitution lies the affirmation of equality  and  dignity  of
ordinary men and women. It tells us that the  humblest  amongst  us  have  a
right to respect  and  protection.  It  assures  us  that  the  law  has  no
favourites; or does it? This question has plagued me for a long time. It  is
very relevant to the debate here today. Are we creating a society  in  which
women can truly rely on the force of the law to  protect  them  and  not  to
work against them?

Sexual harassment is not necessarily an act of  violence;  it  is  its  soft
underbelly.  It  is  subtle,  secretive  and  leaves  no  bruises,  but   it
categorically denies a woman her dignity. And  for  this  reason  alone  you
would expect vigilance in rooting out any signs of this  culture  finding  a
foothold in our society, especially in our public  life  where  leaders  are
expected to lead by  example,  upholding  the  values  of  the  Constitution
through their own actions and leaving no room for doubt on where they  stand
with regard to women.

It is at this level that President Mbeki can exert moral leadership  of  the
nation to which he has committed  himself  at  the  start  of  the  16-days'
campaign of fighting violence against women and children. I  have  therefore
today, again, written to Foreign  Minister  Nkosazana  Dlamini-Zuma,  urging
her to take  action  in  the  disciplinary  processes  involving  Ambassador
Norman Mashabane. [Interjections.] And I have sent a copy of this letter  to
President Mbeki's office.

Two weeks ago Ambassador Mashabane was found guilty  on  a  22nd  charge  of
sexual harassment, and has this past week again  lodged  an  appeal  against
the  guilty  verdict.  In  the  meantime,  he  remains  in  full  employ  as
Ambassador and his first appeal is two years old.

The disgrace of Kamp Staaldraad,  although  not  directly  involving  women,
displays a mentality  which  has  nothing  to  do  with  team  building  and
everything to do with dehumanising men.  This  is  an  attitude  which  must
never be allowed to flourish in the new South Africa. It is the  mindset  of
domination which so often translates into abuse of women.

Three women who reported harassment by  Tamsanqa  Khoza,  then  head  of  St
Albans Prison in East London, have all left the Department  of  Correctional
Services. As one said to me, it was much harder to speak out  than  to  keep
quiet. The botched processes, which  led  to  their  eventual  resignations,
speak of mismanagement on a  terrifying  scale,  but  also  of  an  inherent
resistance by a powerful brotherhood to a fair trial.

In Bisho, Ngwadi Mzamo, a housing department  official,  has  recently  been
promoted despite his conviction  on  charges  of  sexual  assault  with  the
sentence of a fine of R5 000 or 12 months in prison. His victim,  meanwhile,
has been demoted. This was the outcome of her  courageous  stand  to  charge
her superior.

When addressing  a  big,  mixed  audience  on  lack  of  discipline  in  the
Vooruitsig prison in Kroonstad,  the  acting  provincial  commissioner  Zack
Modise explained transformation in the following way:  ``Men,  if  you  make
love to your wives, you should try changing position. Let them  lie  on  top
and see how good it is'', and more of the same.  This  was  not  said  in  a
secret corridor, but in an open meeting.  Quite  clearly,  the  commissioner
did  not  consider  these  statements  as  reflecting  on  his  professional
judgment.

These are not examples of actions by  underprivileged  and  uneducated  men.
They are the actions of men in powerful public  positions,  having  attained
the top posts in their fields. They are the public  face  of  South  Africa,
and what their actions are saying is: Might is right. It is saying that  the
Constitution is for other people; that it is okay  for  women  to  have  top
jobs as long they are compliant when sex is demanded of them; that  as  long
as you keep quiet and don't complain, you  will  be  okay.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I would just like to say that  the  campaign  is
to be welcomed ... [Interjections.] ... Deputy President gave. I  also  read
his speech of the other day - a long speech  -  which  I  thought  was  very
good, and we welcome it.

The campaign has several objectives, the primary one must  be  to  sensitise
the public generally with regard to the prevalence of this  kind  of  abuse.
This abuse often goes unnoticed and quietly, and  often  close  friends  and
family are not aware that it's taking place. So it becomes, then,  incumbent
on the church, on schools and on families to become  sensitive  to  some  of
the tell-tale signs of the abuse and to become educated and aware of how  to
deal with it.

It's very often one thing to know what abuse takes place, but quite  another
to know what the correct action is,  what  would  be  positive  and  helpful
action to take, what your legal rights are, what  your  social  duties  are,
how you should go about  it  so  that  you  deal  with  it  sensitively  and
effectively in order to stop the abuse and help end the abuse;  and  to  get
alongside people and counsel them in whatever way you can.

Just as one needs to learn first aid so that when one comes upon  the  scene
of an accident one has the equipment and the knowledge of how to  cope  with
people, so it is also with this kind of thing: that the public, and  I  hope
this campaign, will help people become sensitive to the prevalence  of  this
abuse so that we can help reduce it.

The state also has a role, families have  a  role,  churches  have  a  role.
Permissiveness,  pornography,  extreme  forms  of  TV  and  film   violence,
gambling, prostitution, and the so-called  sex  industry  are  all  breeding
grounds that foster family breakdowns and sexual abuse. They reduce  respect
for life and for property.

The state has a role to play; to lead in this. We can't complain  about  the
products or consequences of some of  these  so-called  industries,  complain
about what is taking place, when very often the very fact that these  things
exist - some of these gambling houses  and  so  on  -  have  the  effect  of
eroding  and  assaulting  the  very  values  that  underpin  a  healthy  and
productive family life, and good relationships. A breakdown is often  caused
by some of this violence that we see on our televisions, in  our  films  and
by some of the things we allow in our society.

I'd  implore  the  Deputy  President  to   please   stop   this   trend   of
permissiveness, promiscuity and pornography and so on. Let's roll it back  a
bit, at least, so that thereby, in my view, we make a contribution  also  to
reducing abuse.

We wish the programme well, and we are glad that we are  able  to  speak  on
it. I thank you.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chair, his Excellency the Deputy President,  the  hon
Minister, and the honourable House, the launch  of  this  programme  by  the
Government is splendid  confirmation  that  we  shall  not  tire,  but  will
grapple with the monster of violence and abuse against our loved ones  until
we die.

I wholeheartedly agree with those who say that we cannot turn  the  tide  if
we don't involve the men as  the  solution  rather  than  the  problem.  The
statistics  on  violence,  especially  sexual  violence  against  women  and
children, show that 52 425 cases of rape and attempted  rape  were  reported
to the police  between  April  last  year  and  March  this  year.  This  is
abhorrent and we, as men, must be prepared to take the bull by the horns.

I am ashamed, as a man, by what is rightly reported to  have  been  said  by
the Mayor of Cape Town, namely that now we must define a new  way  of  being
men: men of compassion, men who do not turn their anger and  frustration  on
the women and children in their lives, men who are strong enough  to  reject
making victims of those who are smaller and weaker than they are.

My appeal to all menfolk is that we  should  propagate  the  message  of  no
violence against women and children throughout, so that it should not  be  a
message  that  dies  off  with  the  lapse  of  time.  I  thank  you,  Madam
Chairperson. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Chairperson, as always, I am called upon to  be
honest and to congratulate the hon Botha for the remarks  she  has  made.  I
think it  is  certainly  our  organisation,  the  governing  party  in  this
country, that has led the way in determining laws that would address  sexual
harassment and abuse against women, and it is our duty to be true  to  those
principles. The hon Botha is correct in  the  remarks  that  she  has  made,
namely, that we show action on the principles that we have encoded  in  law.
Therefore we cannot, on a basis of  party  political  differences,  disagree
with  the  need  to  address  the  very  serious  matter  that  she  raised.
[Applause.]

I am pleased that I am a member of a party which doesn't fear  acknowledging
a need to address where principle is breached, and I  am  sure  the  matters
she has referred to will be addressed.

Earlier speakers have indicated that the national campaign  of  16  Days  of
Activism is a continuation of our country's ongoing  struggle  to  eradicate
violence against women and children and all vulnerable persons. In a  recent
radio interview, young men phoning in sought to ask why I was not  referring
to males who are often  the  subject  of  violence.  I  indicated  that  the
intention of the campaign, while it highlights those who are most often  the
victims of violence, was to address violence against all persons, and it  is
our intention that all violence against all persons who face such  abuse  is
eradicated in our society.
I think a  cursory  review  of  South  Africa's  legislative  framework,  in
respect of the matter of violence, would reveal  that  much  has  been  done
from our Constitution, our national laws, our judicial  innovation  as  well
as community and civil society action. There has  been  much  progress.  The
measures that we are  forced  to  use  to  mark  this  progress  are  a  sad
indictment on our society.

We have recorded that over 2 500 women have in this year, up to  this  time,
approached our police  stations  for  protection  orders;  and  hundreds  of
police persons have  begun  to  improve  their  understanding  of  the  laws
directed at ending  violence  and  bringing  perpetrators  to  book.  Police
stations across our country look very different from five  years  ago.  Many
now have reception  or  trauma  rooms  where  victims  of  violence  receive
support and counselling.

Hundreds of victims are breaking the silence.  In  speaking,  many  of  them
criticise the Police Service and  tell  of  what  they  call  their  further
abuse, and then refer to their  further  abuse  in  our  courts.  These  are
matters we still need to address. With all this  evidence  we  have  a  very
serious problem, one in which  our  Government,  I  believe,  is  playing  a
leading role in  attempting  to  resolve  it.  We  have,  I  think,  to  ask
ourselves: What is wrong with South Africa? What is wrong with  our  people?
Why do we continue on this path of violence against women, against  children
and against ourselves?

Recent developments in our courts suggest  to  me  that  we  may  have  some
indication of areas that require further attention, of areas  that  we  must
address if we are to succeed in confronting this particular  blight  on  our
society.

Our Constitution provides women with the right to be free from violence.  It
is a right that we treasure.  But  it  is  a  right  that  is  difficult  to
practically enforce, despite the revolution our first democratic  Government
wrought on our society and our culture.

Our Constitution contains, in section 12(1)(c), the right to  be  free  from
all forms of violence, from public  or  private  sources.  Of  course,  this
right is available both to men and women. But in our  recent  constitutional
jurisprudence, it has primarily been used to protect  the  most  vulnerable,
women, from violent men.

In the 1990s, the issues of gender violence became a global issue. In  1992,
the Committee on the Elimination of  Discrimination  against  Women  defined
gender-based violence as  a  form  of  discrimination.  The  elimination  of
gender-based violence became a human right, and this right was confirmed  at
the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women.

Recently, our law has been developing what is reasonable to  expect  of  our
police in their task of preventing women from  coming  to  harm.  Two  areas
have been earmarked. Firstly, our courts have held that the police  need  to
be diligent in making sure that only fit and proper people are  granted  gun
licences. When they fail in this duty of  filtering  out  those  with  known
records of violence or psychological disorders, the police  have  been  held
liable and victims have recently been awarded substantial damages.

Secondly, we have the now  famous  Carmichelle  case  which  turned  on  the
release on bail of a man whom the  police  and  prosecutors  knew  to  be  a
sexual threat to women. He had a  string  of  convictions  for  assault  and
rape, and the court finally held, after  a  marathon  process  -  a  painful
marathon, through various courts - that  the  police  and  prosecutors  were
wrong to release him, and that his release was the factual and  legal  cause
of the victim's violation, and that she was entitled  to  damages  from  the
state as a result.

The reason that I raise this case in this House is not only because it is  a
landmark case in our struggle to be free from violence, but also because  it
raises in my mind the issue of  the  insensitivity  of  the  judges  of  our
country to victims of rape.

I read with grave concern the other week the words of Carmel Rickard in  the
Sunday Times, where she wrote:
  As a group, South African judges  -  still  overwhelmingly  male  -  have
  developed a reputation for a lack of sensitivity when it comes to  issues
  relating to women, issues such as rape or gratuitous  physical  violence.
  Nor do they feel the need to  consider  the  listener  when  speaking  in
  court.

She was referring here to the appeal hearing into the Carmichelle matter  in
which one of our most senior judges  was  considering  the  earlier  violent
record of the man who subsequently attacked  and  violated  Carmichelle.  In
the judge's view, one of the rapist's  earlier  convictions  scored,  as  he
said, only a 5 out of 10 on his rape scale.

What outraged Rickard, and I think what should outrage every member in  this
House, is the notion that we can grade rape; you can give it a 1 out  of  10
or a 3 out of 10, or else, the judge did a 5 out of 10. This  5  out  of  10
rape occurred two months before the brutal attack on Carmichelle.

I think it is unacceptable to hear our judges talk like this. We should  all
call out loud to those judges in Bloemfontein and  elsewhere  that  we  will
not stand for this sort of verbal abuse of the ordeal  that  so  many  women
are forced to endure in contemporary South Africa.

I was also outraged in September to read about  the  decision  in  the  Cape
High Court to overturn rape convictions in  a  paedophile  case.  The  court
ruled that the girl-children,  aged  13,  had  consented  to  sex,  and  the
perpetrators were found guilty of the lesser offence of statutory  rape  and
given a three year sentence.

Experts working in this field have claimed that this judgment sets back  the
battle against paedophilia by 15 to 20 years, as one authority said  at  the
time:


  This taps into children's worst fears - that we adults are going to blame
  them. We are going to say they asked for it - they wanted  it,  and  that
  maybe they liked the experience.
Thirteen-year-old children are raped by adult men, and this is how  some  of
our judges are dealing with these matters.

I believe that this must change. I would ask that our Government looks  very
seriously at some of the  statements  of  judges  and  of  magistrates,  the
sentences they hand down and the kind of  attitude  they  convey  about  how
they intend to address these very serious  concerns  that  we  have  in  our
society.

However, we need to go beyond the judiciary. We need to go, as  I  said,  to
our communities. We need to ask about the degree to  which  our  communities
are committed to women and children's safety. We need  to  ask  whether  our
neighbours are interested in the safety of their neighbours. We need to  ask
whether in our schools we are doing enough. Are we educating young  men  out
of violence? Are we educating young women to be confident  citizens  of  our
country?  Are  we  addressing  the  violent  nature  of  our  society  after
apartheid? Because a negative character has been left on our society and  we
must pay attention to it. We do have a  negative  notion  of  women  in  our
society. We regard them as subordinate, open to abuse  by  males  and  worth
little in many of our communities. I think we need to have this  attitudinal
component placed in our curriculum as a standard part  of  the  learning  of
our society.

I think the law is certainly an important agent of change. But I believe  it
is vital that we begin to examine other aspects of the law that  may  remain
wanting at this time. For example, is it still  the  case  that  only  young
people of 18 and above have access to places which sell alcohol? I see  many
young people entering places where alcohol is sold. And  we  hear  from  the
Police Service that many of these youth clubs, that claim to  be  for  under
18 children, have a lively drug trade within them, and that after the  clubs
have closed their doors, young girls  are  exposed  to  violence,  rape  and
other threats.

We need to look at whether we are indeed assisting perpetrators to  overcome
their psychological attitude towards  women  and  to  overcome  the  violent
character that they have. Are we linking prison  sentencing  to  counselling
so that people do not emerge from prison and become repeat offenders?

I believe it is vital that we take action to make the 16 Days of Activism  a
real victory for our society, as our President  has  said:  ``Let  it  be  a
focus on strategic partnerships'' - let it be  Government,  let  it  be  the
private sector, let it be civil society, let it be organised labour, let  it
be the diplomatic community and all of us united in  spreading  the  message
about combating violence against women and children, because  until  we  act
together, we will not defeat this blight. Thank you. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, hon Deputy President, hon members, thank you very much  for  an
exceedingly encouraging debate. Very often, because justice is  the  leading
department, which only means that we support the  Presidency,  the  face  of
this campaign has a justice profile  and  that  is  incorrect.  One  of  the
things that we must remember is that in this work, I  take  my  justice  hat
off and I report directly to the Minister and the Presidency. It is  because
the Presidency has demonstrated the political will  to  drive  this  process
that our programme is getting stronger and stronger each year.

Mr Deputy President, I must thank you  and  the  President  for  giving  our
campaign the kind of gravitas that it needs, and it also lends us  the  kind
of muscle - because we need muscle -  to  change  attitudes  and  behaviours
that are demonstrated in our country. So, without the  political  will,  let
us just acknowledge that we would be  nowhere.  I  am  concerned  about  the
eight minutes because it's too little time. We could talk  for  three  hours
and we know this. But I will try to acknowledge the inputs of everyone.

I would like to thank the hon Themba so much for knowing  about  the  events
of the programme. Mr Deputy President, you will be interested to  know  that
there are over 400 activities happening in this country within the  next  16
days. Communities in the rural areas and in the  towns  have  come  together
and said: How do we acknowledge and join this process? I can only  say  that
it  is  because  of  members  of  Parliament  like  these,  who  tell  their
communities through their constituency offices what work  has  to  be  done,
that this kind of message gets spread around. I am very grateful to you  for
your support.

To the hon Adams, I agree with you. Silence is an abuse. Very often we  have
people who come and use the legislation, for instance,  on  sexual  offences
and domestic violence. They are then pressured by families  and  spouses  to
withdraw the charges. So, we must  please  say  that  if  we  are  going  to
eradicate the stigma that  is  attached  to  sexual  offences  and  domestic
violence, it is imperative that the mother of the child  or  the  father  of
the child stands up and says: I am proud to support my  child  through  this
legal process, because it is the right  thing  to  do.  So  please,  I  must
acknowledge the hon Adams's input.

With regard to the hon Botha's input, I must concur with her  and  with  the
Chairperson of this House that we have principles, and we  should  stick  to
them. When they have not fulfilled themselves in the living reality  of  all
of us, we then are let down by  systems.  We  trust  that  the  disciplinary
process will kick  in  and  that  the  dignity  accorded  to  women  by  our
Constitution and other legislation - the women of this country,  both  young
and old - are vindicated through the disciplinary process.

Mr Durr, we agree that  we  need,  critically,  not  to  just  make  this  a
mouthing discussion. It must not be merely words.  Because  in  fact,  until
behaviours are changed, it is through them that we acknowledge equality  and
dignity within our relationships, in our workplace  and  in  the  community.
Until our behaviour changes,  to  demonstrate  the  changed  values  in  our
society and within ourselves, these are just words. This programme  has  got
to be extended beyond 16 days. Every  day  has  to  be  a  concerted  battle
against violence against women and children.

The role  of  parents  here  is  critically  important.  Perhaps  more  than
anything this goes beyond justice because we are talking to  ourselves  and,
in my case, as the mother of a son. I raise a son in the hope that  one  day
as an adult, he will be proud to say that he has chosen the path  of  peace,
because this demonstrates most eloquently his  real  manhood.  We  know  and
acknowledge that violence is the ultimate cowardice,  because  it  is  about
domination and targeting the vulnerable. I hope that as  a  parent,  I  have
taught my son these values.

It is so important that we show our children also how to avoid  risk.  Don't
let your child walk to the café on his or her own, if they are  young.  They
are vulnerable. Make sure that some adult, elder  brother  or  sister  walks
with the young child. Avoid risks. Don't walk into dark areas. We can  teach
our children to be very savvy about how to avoid risks - not  in  fear,  but
in strength, and to say: ``no, to affirm  my  individuality,  I  will  avoid
this risk. I will make sure that I call an adult, or if I need  to  cross  a
dark area, I will go and get three adults to walk with me,  if  necessary.''
They need to learn how to be very savvy,  modern  citizens  and  to  protect
themselves from these impositions.

We are all shamed by violence of any kind. But we are so shamed by  violence
against children and women because it is the vulnerability of these  victims
that makes this a statement about our national psyche. I am determined  that
with the kind of support that we have had  in  the  conversation  today,  we
stand a chance, by standing together, because the  Chairperson  referred  to
this as a struggle and she is right. This society is not free  -  not  until
the women of this country are free. We can put as  many  laws  in  place  to
create opportunities, but opportunities cannot be realised in  the  face  of
violence. If people are afraid, in the workplace, to assert their  right  to
promotion because there is fear of threats, violence  and  harassment,  they
will not assert themselves. This happens particularly in the case  of  women
in the workplace, in communities, and all over the place.

I would like to say to you, Chairperson, that our courts are getting  better
and better at responding to these issues of domestic  violence.  We  saw  in
the report of this House that it is far from  perfect.  But  you  know,  the
frightening thing about this is that at the  Wynberg  court  in  Cape  Town,
during the first six month of this year, that court issued 2 500  protection
orders. Of the number of applications for protection  orders,  93%  in  fact
ended in successful  protection  orders  being  issued  by  the  court.  The
problem is that we are devoting more and  more  of  our  resources  to  this
problem because women, men and children are using the legislation.

Until we demonstrate the will to prevent violence in  the  first  place,  we
could actually in the long run undermine our entire justice  system  because
our civil justice system will collapse in the  face  of  this  process.  Our
family courts cannot deal with the other issues around this because it is  a
very important issue and they prioritise it. South  Africans  should  decide
and recognise that the role of the criminal justice system is,  in  fact,  a
response mechanism to this process. We tend to respond after the damage  has
been done. That is why as South Africans, brothers and sisters, we  have  to
ensure that the damage is not done in the first place. The Act entitles  you
to certain levels of service from the police officers, and  if  you  do  not
get those services,  you  have  the  right  to  complain  and  an  automatic
disciplinary process comes  into  play.  If  you  hear  women  and  children
screaming next door, go and report the  violence.  You  are  your  brother's
keeper.

Let me just say about the way in which our men learn to socialise,  that  if
we raise our boys in the psychologist's  trap  that  they  are  cowboys  who
don't cry, they just bleed, we will never get  this  problem  right.  It  is
interesting that the group most vulnerable to violence, internationally  and
particularly in this country, are young men  between  15  and  24.  This  is
because they participate in riskier behaviour. They drive fast  cars,  carry
guns and experiment with drugs. But the point about this is that  until  the
boys start recognising their vulnerability to violence  and  that  they  are
potential victims, and hopefully survivors of violence, they  will  continue
to be statistics, to perpetrate violent acts upon women because  they  would
not identify with the victim status of either men or women in this process.

They cannot become positive and proactive agents of change.  It  is  how  we
raise our children that is  a  crucial  question.  And  that  we  teach  our
children that the path of peace is an eloquent and  admirable  demonstration
of their manhood, if they are boys, and of  their  womanhood,  if  they  are
girls. I thank you, members, for a very nice debate and I ask you to  please
join us. [Applause.]

There is one  final  thing:  We  are  raising  funds  for  the  Government's
programmes for NGOs working with victims of violence. Last  year  we  raised
R1,8 million, and we want to try and better this. This money  goes  straight
to the Foundation for Human Rights and it  is  earmarked  for  NGOs  working
with victims of violence. You can  pledge  R10  by  dialling  the  following
number - 082 003 9181. There is also a landline facility  -  086  747  7400.
The money goes straight to victims of  violence.  When  we  ask  people  for
donations, we raise it in such a way that  administrative  costs  are  taken
off and the monies dedicated and the Foundation for Human  Rights  helps  us
in this process. Thank you all for your support. [Applause.]

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

                                  (Debate)

Mr T RALANE: Deputy Chair of Committees,  Deputy  President,  and  Minister,
the period, commencing Wednesday  12  November  2003,  was,  for  the  Joint
Budget Committee, the beginning of the most  intensive  activity  since  its
formation.  On  this  day  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement   was
released.

The  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  precedes  the  formal  national
Budget, to be released in February next year. The Medium-Term Budget  Policy
Statement sets  out  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policy  framework  and
informs the 2004-Budget.

In other words, the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement  gives  the  country
and its citizens an opportunity to discuss  the  measures  necessary  to  be
taken in order to meet the goal of incrementally transforming our society.

The Reconstruction and Development Programme provided  the  country  with  a
comprehensive plan to overhaul the public policy and services of the  former
regime. The objectives of the Reconstruction and Development  Programme  are
the following: to meet basic needs; to build  the  economy;  to  democratise
the state and society; and to develop  human  resources  and  to  build  the
nation.

Government's  performance   in   addressing   these   objectives,   and   in
implementing subsequent policies and  programmes,  has  been  examined.  The
document  titled,  ``Towards  a  Ten-year  Review''  assesses   Government's
progress and shortcomings.

The Ten-year Review attempts to evaluate the extent to which Government  has
achieved its objectives in the past decade. It also  explores  the  possible
policy permutations for the next decade in the context of the  RDP  and  the
national Constitution. To address the challenges outlined  in  the  Ten-year
Review  is  the  point  of  departure  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget   Policy
Statement.

The Joint Budget Committee held public hearings  before  which  20  national
departments and 12 parastatal and civil society institutions appeared.

Although our GDP growth is expected to be around 2,2%  this  year,  the  ANC
Government managed its  macroeconomy  in  a  manner  that  has  resulted  in
unprecedented stability. The inflation rate fell to 5,4% in September  2003,
and is expected to remain within the target range of between 3% and 6%  over
the medium-term period.

The prime interest rate has fallen  to  its  lowest  level  over  a  17-year
period. Moreover, in his  address  to  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-
operation and Development - Global Forum  on  International  Investment,  on
Monday, 17 November 2003, the Minister of Finance said the following:
  Despite  stagnant  global  demand,  total  investment  in  South  Africa,
  expanded by over 8% in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  continuing  the
  momentum from 9% in the second  half  of  the  year.  Private  investment
  expanded by 7% in the first half  of  this  year.  We  have  achieved  15
  quarters of uninterrupted growth in investment spending and  18  quarters
  of uninterrupted growth in Gross Domestic Product.

During the public hearings, economists were of one mind:  South  Africa  has
achieved remarkable macroeconomic stability.  Expansion  of  the  government
deficit to 2,6% of the GDP for the current year and 3,2% projected  for  the
next year - more than the  2,4%  estimated  in  the  2003-Budget  review  in
February this year - does not threaten macrostability. The  negative  effect
of this expansion is cushioned by the gains from lower  costs  of  servicing
Government's debts and lower inflation.

We need to understand deficit expansion in relation to  confidence-building.
On this score, I am indebted to Joseph Stiglitz - the  former  economist  at
the World Bank - and  his  recently-published  book  The  Roaring  Nineties.
Stiglitz argues that confidence matters in economic policy;  and  it  cannot
be whipped out of thin air.

In South Africa, carefully targeted deficit spending stimulates the  economy
in the short run and strengthens growth in the long run. This wider  deficit
in the short term is  in  line  with  Government's  counter-cyclical  fiscal
policy approach and is consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability.

The key priorities, as set out in the Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement,
are: renewed focus on employment creation through the expanded Public  Works
Programme; increased infrastructure spending;  R12 billion for HIV/Aids  and
ARV rollout over four years; extension of  social  security  grants  through
child support grants and other grants targeting  vulnerable  groups;  school
textbooks for poor schools;  strengthening the safety  and  security  sector
through the sector policing strategy, and  a  new  protection  and  security
services sector;  justice centres for children; promoting  peace  in  Africa
and promoting broad-based black  economic  empowerment  -  a  new  budgetary
priority.

The increased investment in social expenditure enhances  our  prospects  for
peace. Government is seen to be investing in its people  and  is  the  major
contributor to a renewal of confidence.

Accelerated depreciation allowances for designated urban  development  zones
have been introduced. The additional sum of  R1,9  billion  rands  has  been
announced  and  this  initiates  the   national   antiretroviral   treatment
programme.

Child support grants are extended to children up to the  age  of  14.  Three
thousand additional personnel members will be  employed  in  the  SA  Police
Service over the MTEF period. Children are  diverted  from  prisons  towards
rehabilitative environments.  The number of workers and learners  benefiting
from skills programmes overseen by the Setas  -  the  sector  education  and
training authorities - will be increased.

All this proves that fiscal reductions are growth-enhancing.  Investment  in
people, by expanding their skill base and promoting their safety  and  their
health, has a remarkable symmetrical  effect  on  economic  growth.  In  any
economy poorly equipped schools, decadent inner cities and high crime  rates
make investment unattractive. Structured and phased deficits  are  the  best
way to promote  confidence  in  a  nation.  This  defies  standard  economic
theory, universally taught in economic courses around the world.

I trust that NCOP members enjoyed their interaction with  and  participation
in the work of the Joint Budget Committee. I would  like  to  thank  my  co-
chair in the National Assembly, Mr Nhlanhla Nene, for  his  co-operation.  I
urge the House to endorse the Report tabled in the ATC  on  18  November.  I
thank you.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you, hon Chair, hon Minister. I think every single  person
who is competent to address the Medium-Term Budget Statement,  and  everyone
who is not, has already done so. So,  while  I  do  not  hesitate  to  class
myself amongst the latter, I still  hope  I  am  not  going  to  stand  here
regurgitating comments which have now become common coinage. Therefore I  do
not want to tell the Minister that his is an ``election  budget''  which  he
has already denied, and I will give him the benefit  of  the  doubt.  He  is
probably telling the truth - the election budget will come in February.

Also, I do not want to comment  on  the  Aids  budget  and  its  chances  of
actually reaching the millions who need to be touched by  it  sooner  rather
than later, except in the context of sharing my  concern  that  delivery  in
this country is increasingly being devolved down to  a  local  level,  where
capacity and commitment simply do not match the need.

I rather  want  to  concentrate  on  the  proposals  to  alleviate  poverty.
Discussions in the Joint Budget Committee by all  the  various  commentators
reflected relative consensus on the  concern  that  the  enormous  envisaged
Public Works Programme would be more poverty alleviating than job creating.

I believe we have insufficiently confronted the issue of  job  shedding  and
job creation as intensively and openly as we should.  At  global  level,  it
should be the subject of intensive think-tank  discussions.  It  is  at  one
level an issue where policy differences in  approach  to  economic  problems
play an important role, but it is bigger than  that.  Jobs  in  the  primary
sector have been shed for the past 50 years - it is not a new phenomenon.

The fact that many of our unemployed are not skilled beyond the level  where
they can do anything  other  than  the  unskilled  work  required  in  these
sectors, presents us with  a  particular  problem.  Temporary  jobs  in  the
public sector are not going to address the long-term problem.

But the positive factor is that this Budget statement clearly shows that  we
have the money to finance projects  which  can  at  least  create  temporary
relief, and perhaps put down a foundation for growth on a  scale  which  can
increase salaries and wages to the employed, from whence  I  fear  the  only
trickle-down effect will actually derive. What has been most interesting  to
me, is the way the Budget statement throws a spotlight  on  how  intricately
interrelated Government  decision-making  and  its  intended  or  unintended
consequences are.

On the one hand we have Black Economic  Empowerment  and  Employment  Equity
Targets; on the other, a firm conviction amongst whites  that  their  skills
are not valued. This very extended Public Works Programme of Government  has
again convinced me that the approach of disaggregating these two  components
of the South African economy  is  short-sighted,  and  will  not  serve  the
interests of the real poor.

About R120 billion in combined spending  from  Government  and  the  private
sector will be earmarked for engineering projects over the next five  years.
At the head of this enormous project, aimed at creating a million new  jobs,
will be the Public Service. At the delivery end will be local government.

But last week the SA Association of Consulting Engineers warned  that  there
might not be enough engineers left to cope with the work. Up to 90%  of  its
members had problems finding quality staff, as many qualified engineers  had
left the country, and the profession had trouble  attracting  new  recruits.
This applies  equally  to  finding  black  engineers  and  recruiting  white
engineers to develop and  maintain  infrastructure.  ``Increasingly,''  says
the SA Association of Consulting  Engineers,  ``engineering,  especially  at
the Public Service level, is seen as a commodity whose cost can be bid  down
to the lowest level''.

Minister, I hope that Treasury does  not  find  its  sound,  basic  economic
approach hamstrung by an approach to race  and  training,  which  sacrifices
the huge potential we have for growing the economy and the welfare of  South
African citizens, on the altar of  a  misplaced  political  correctness.  We
need  everybody  involved.  We  cannot   afford   to   ignore   one   single
contribution, no matter from whence it comes, in  achieving  a  better  life
for all.

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister van Finansies  en  kollegas:"Die
middeltermyn begrotingsraamwerk is geensins op die verkiesing gerig  nie  en
die Regering sal nie fiskale dissipline met  groter  tekorte  oorboord  gooi
nie.''

Hierdie aanhaling is uit 'n Afrikaanse dagblad gister na aanleiding van  wat
die agb Minister van Finansies tydens 'n debat eergister in die  ander  Huis
sou gesê het. Hoewel ek nie tydens dié debat teenwoordig  was  nie,  kan  ek
aanvaar dat die Minister nie so 'n stelling sommer uit die bloute  sou  maak
nie, maar dat dit in antwoord op 'n vraag moes gewees  het.  Indien  dit  so
was, kan ek net verder spekuleer dat mens nie ver vir die oorsprong van  die
vraag hoef te soek nie, en dat dit sonder twyfel  uit  die  bondel  van  die
sogenaamde ``koalisie vir verandering'' kom - en uit die aard van die  vraag
- dat dit kom van die ``terugveg"-vennoot in daardie  koalise  wat  loop  en
dagdroom oor 'n alternatiewe regering vir Suid-Afrika.

Maar laat ek ophou spekuleer oor die goedkoop politieke munt wat mense  hoop
om  uit  so  'n   belangrike   beleidsverklaring   soos   die   middeltermyn
begrotingsraamwerk te put en liewer konsentreer op 'n positiewe benadering.

Dit word verder berig dat die Minister gesê het dat, en  ek  haal  weer  aan
uit   dieselfde   berig,   ``die   begrotingsraamwerk   is   versigtig    en
verantwoordelik opgestel en gegrond op organiese groei en prestasie  in  die
verlede''.

Uit ondervinding van  soortgelyke  begrotings  en  mini-begrotings  oor  ten
minste die afgelope vyf jaar, en met inagneming van die  huidige  stand  van
die land se finansies, weet ons dat ook  hierdie  begrotingsraamwerk  uiters
versigtig en verantwoordelik opgestel is.

Voorsitter, ek is ook 'n lid van die Gesamentlike Begrotingskomitee wat  oor
die  afgelope  twee  weke  voorleggings  deur   verskeie   departemente   en
instansies na aanleiding van  die  Minister  se  toespraak  op  12  November
aangehoor het en enige kommentaar wat ek  vandag  lewer,  is  merendeels  na
aanleiding van mededelings deur die gemelde instansies,  soos  dit  ook  uit
die verslag van die Gesamentlike  Begrotingskomitee  blyk.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance and colleagues:


  Die middeltermyn begrotingsraamwerk is geensins op die  verkiesing  gerig
  nie en die  Regering  sal  nie  fiskale  dissipline  met  groter  tekorte
  oorboord gooi nie.

This quotation comes  from  an  Afrikaans  daily  paper  of  yesterday  with
reference to what the hon  Minister  of  Finance  allegedly  said  during  a
debate in the other House the day  before  yesterday.  Although  I  was  not
present during this debate, I can accept that the Minister  would  not  have
made such a statement for no particular reason, but that it must  have  been
in reply to a question. If that was the case, I can just  further  speculate
that one does not have to look any further for the origin of this  question,
and that it comes,  without  a  doubt,  from  the  ranks  of  the  so-called
``coalition for change'' - and from the very nature of the question  -  that
it comes from the ``fight back'' component of  that  coalition  which  walks
around daydreaming about an alternative government for South Africa.

But let me stop my speculation about the cheap political  gain  that  people
hope to derive from such an important policy statement  as  the  Medium-Term
Budget Framework, and rather focus on a positive approach.

It is further reported that the Minister has said that,  and  I  quote  from
the same article, ``die begrotingsraamwerk is versigtig  en  verantwoordelik
opgestel en gegrond op organiese groei en prestasie in die verlede.''

We know, from our experience with similar budgets and mini-budgets  over  at
least the past five years, and bearing in mind the present position  of  the
country's finances, that this budget  framework  has  also  been  formulated
with extreme care and responsibility.

Chairperson, I am also a member of the  Joint  Budget  Committee  which  has
been hearing submissions by various departments and  institutions  over  the
past two weeks based on the  Minister's  speech  of  12  November,  and  any
comments that I make today are  for  the  greater  part  with  reference  to
statements by the said institutions, as is also apparent from the report  of
the Joint Budget Committee.]

Chairperson, firstly, I associate myself fully with  the  positive  approach
of the  Joint  Budget  Committee  towards  the  MTBPS,  namely  its  careful
consideration of  the  likely  impact  of  expenditure  allocations  on  the
effectiveness  and  efficiency  with  which  departments  respond   to   the
Government's stated policy priorities;  and  secondly,  whether  departments
are making the tough choices required and  tailoring  their  expenditure  to
priorities by  choosing  effective  strategies  and  seeking  efficiency  in
implementation.

Looking at the MTBPS from this perspective, one realises that it  is,  to  a
great  extent,  a  planning  and  monitoring  document   to   be   used   by
beneficiaries in a self-reflection exercise. Do they really need  what  they
have been asking for and have they used with care  the  resources  allocated
to them?

Do they realise that the funds which were previously allocated to them,  and
which might have been lying unspent by  them,  could  have  been  used  more
resourcefully by other departments to alleviate the need and  the  suffering
of the poor and the sick? If they do that, then the MTBPS almost  becomes  a
training manual in spending priorities, effective strategies  and  efficient
implementation, and a checklist against which  departments  can  and  should
gauge their own financial performance.

In conclusion I wish to congratulate the Minister  on  a  sound  and  wisely
constructed Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement.  South  Africa  can  rest
assured that its finances are in very capable hands.

The New NP supports the MTBPS. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister  and  hon  members,
economists, civil society  and  the  public  at  large  have  received  very
positively the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, which was tabled  on  12
November by the Minister of Finance. This response is  appropriate,  because
once more the Government and the Minister of Finance have demonstrated  that
our country is capable of making decisions  that  are  consistent  with  the
objectives set long ago by the ANC policies,  before  1994,  as  opposed  to
what the hon Sandra is saying. It also confirms that we are  capable,  as  a
nation, to live up to the challenges that our country still faces in  trying
to redress the imbalances of the past.

The release of the Towards Ten Years of Freedom  review  document  has  also
confirmed that the past ten years have  been  fruitfully  employed,  gaining
experience and making policy interventions, in  order  to  improve  people's
lives. It has also highlighted the challenges and shortcomings that we  need
to address, as Government, as we move forward.

The  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  has  clearly  demonstrated  the
political will of the ANC Government to respond to  the  serious  challenges
that our country faces. This has  been  done  despite  the  global  economic
slowdown, which has exerted its impact on our domestic economy. Despite  all
this we have steadily decreased the CPIX inflation rate, which  has  reached
its lowest level in 20 years. And this bodes well for further reductions  in
interest rates, as we take into account  the  latest  results  on  inflation
reported by Statistics South Africa two days ago.

While recognising all the positive developments in the economy, it  is  very
important that we continue to be vigilant because prices tend to be  sticky,
even in the long run. For  example,  increases  in  producer  prices  almost
always trigger higher prices for consumers, but  producer  price  reductions
do not necessarily lead to lower prices for  consumers.  Therefore  consumer
activism in South Africa is very important so that the poorest of  the  poor
can benefit from the positive developments that  have  resulted  from  these
good things happening in our economy.

In tabling the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement the Minister informed  us
that Government has set up, or established, a team to look at the impact  of
the administered prices in achieving the macro-economic objective, which  is
inflation targeting between the range of 2% to 6%.

We therefore call upon all committees in Parliament to make sure  that  they
do their oversight work - and even in municipalities and other state  organs
- so that whatever they do in increasing rates and taxes, they are  able  to
do that within this objective; because it allows us as a country  to  reduce
inflation so that poor people can continue to afford to buy  food.  I  think
it is in the interest of the majority of the  poor  citizens  that  we  must
continue to do so, in doing our oversight.

It is against this background that we are able to  still  see  increases  in
the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  projections  over  the  next  three
years. Provinces will get a bigger share of the budget over the MTEF  period
for the provision of basic social services that they provide in the form  of
health,  education,  social  development  and  housing.   And   also   local
government's share over the MTEF period will see a substantial  increase  in
order to meet the need  for  free  basic  services,  in  the  form  of  free
electricity, free water and sanitation.

Allocations to provinces will increase in  order  to  ensure  that,  amongst
other reasons, the take-up for the  child  support  grant  is  accommodated,
because the age  cohorts  will  increase  further  to  accommodate  children
between the ages of nine and 10-years old. Hon members  will  remember  that
the take-up of social grants  has  increased  substantially,  including  the
take-up of the old age pension, the foster care  grant,  the  child  support
grant, the disability grant and other grants. So it is  therefore  important
that we understand that,  within  these  parameters,  this  budget  increase
going to provinces, amongst others,  is  aimed  at  servicing  this,  whilst
noting that there is an agency that is being mooted.  There  is  a  Bill  in
Parliament currently which is talking about establishing the agency.  So  it
is important that we understand  this  issue;  that  this  increase  in  the
provincial allocation, amongst other things, considers this kind of issue.

The R12 billion that has been allocated to the  roll-out  of  antiretroviral
drugs, alongside prevention measures, is very important. With this lies  the
responsibility of all of us, and society at large, to rise to the  challenge
and assist people who  have  Aids  by  making  sure  that  they  take  their
medication as prescribed. If communities are not going  to  be  involved  in
the monitoring of people who are taking these drugs, then  these  drugs  are
not going to have the desired impact.

It is also important that we note that  these  drugs  will  not  necessarily
cure Aids, but rather that it will prolong people's lives,  that  is,  those
who are affected by HIV and Aids. It is therefore incumbent upon all  of  us
to make sure that the millions of people who are  not  yet  affected,  those
who are not yet HIV-positive, remain negative. And  the  resources  that  we
have in the form of antiretrovirals and other mechanisms  that  we  have  in
our comprehensive strategy are geared  at  making  sure  that  those  people
remain negative.

Let us therefore redouble  our  efforts  to  encourage  those  who  are  not
sexually active to abstain, and those  who  cannot  abstain  to  please  use
condoms. And those who cannot do either of the two must remain  faithful  to
their partners. Let us spread the message, not the disease.

Members, it is also important to note  that  Government  has  completed  its
work on the HIV and Aids programme. This  has  been  made  possible  by  the
pilot studies that have been implemented throughout  the  country  over  the
past two years. This process must not be seen outside  of  the  Government's
comprehensive policies on HIV and Aids. But it must  be  seen  as  part  and
parcel of completing that process, because often it is said that  Government
has never had policies on Aids. This response is just a  kneejerk  response.
However, we believe that is not the truth.

The committee welcomes the fact that learner  support  materials  have  been
prioritised  by  our  Government,  with  a  particular  focus  on  the  poor
communities in the rural areas. This is  important  to  these  learners  and
their parents who may not have any means  to  pay  for  such  materials,  if
Government did not have this kind of priority.

Recently we visited some  provinces  when  doing  political  work  with  the
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. But what we saw in  one  community  hall
in this particular province, which I will not mention, was  a  big  pile  of
learner support materials, for example, exercise  books,  pencils,  erasers,
and so forth, including  textbooks  and  the  files  which  were  meant  for
governing bodies to be utilised for their training  and  to  equip  them  in
understanding their role. All these things were lying there  in  this  room,
and the MEC concerned of that province claimed that he  did  not  know  what
was going on. And  I  hope  that  this  additional  allocation  for  learner
support material will be used for the purpose intended,  but  in  particular
that the stationery procured will be delivered to schools  and  utilised  by
learners for the purpose intended.

And I do wish  to  appeal  to  all  legislators,  including  provincial  and
national parliamentarians, to play an active part in carrying out  oversight
over departments and civil servants at all levels.  We  must  guard  against
abuse and misuse of resources, but  always  strive  towards  improving  poor
people's lives. And I think the delivery of stationery in this  instance  is
a case in point.

It is my firm belief that the limited resources  at  our  disposal  must  be
utilised  to  improve  people's  lives,  and  the  provisioning  of   school
materials in this regard must be advanced; and we must not  compromise  this
objective. I am saying this in the light of  the  fact  that  in  order  for
Government  to  provide  the  necessary  allocation  to  address  the   many
competing needs facing our country - sometimes we have to go out and  borrow
resources in order to do so - it is necessary  that  these  resources,  when
they are at the disposal of departments, be utilised accordingly.

Government has been commended in the past, and even now,  for  managing  our
finances in  a  manner  that  is  prudent.  The  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement also continues to take a careful approach in the financing of  the
budget deficit that our country has. And I think we would  like  to  commend
the Minister and Government for this.

The committee supports the bold decision taken  by  Government  to  do  away
with the Community-Based Public Works Programme and to replace it  with  the
Extended Public Works Programme which will employ thousands of  people  over
the next five years. We would like to see the private sector rising  to  the
challenge by creating jobs as per what was agreed upon  at  the  Growth  and
Development Summit. But it must also make sure that the 72 000  learnerships
that was agreed to in the job summit are taken up, because it is one of  the
mechanisms of giving  young  people,  who  do  not  have  experience  of  or
exposure to work, the potential of being employed, one way or the other,  or
the opportunity of gaining experience.

We also welcome our Government's continuing peace efforts on the  continent,
because peace in the region is crucial if our country  is  to  maintain  the
stability that we have built financially, economically and  politically.  We
must all strive to give our men and women the  support  they  deserve  while
they are deployed in the many parts of our continent, and that will help  us
to achieve stability. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, may I express my sincere  appreciation
to the contributors  to  this  debate  this  afternoon,  and  perhaps,  more
importantly, to the work of the Joint Budget Committee.

When we first  undertook  the  tabling  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement, about five years ago, it was a bit of  a  shot  in  the  dark.  I
would like to also say that when the first Joint Budget Committee was  first
established, its terms of reference were ill-defined. But, what we  see  now
in the work of the Joint Budget Committee  is  the  maturing  of  a  process
where we, as Government, can receive well-considered advice from  the  Joint
Budget Committee and input this into the finalisation of the numbers  as  we
prepare for the conclusion of the Budget.

The Joint Budget Committee had  dealt  with  a  series  of  issues  but,  in
particular, I would like  to  abstract  three  issues  concerning  which  we
listened very carefully. The first of those  is  the  manner  in  which  the
Joint Budget Committee dealt with the recapitalisation of PostBank. We  take
that advice very seriously. The other two issues are the  sustainability  of
the SA National Defence Force in its own transformation  and  in  empowering
it to undertake the necessary peace-keeping efforts, and the realism of  the
land reform targets. So, we note those issues and I would like to  say  that
we take all of the advice proffered  by  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  very
seriously.

Similarly, it's very important that we remind ourselves that the process  of
Budget reform is still underway. Key within that process of  reform  is  the
shift from the input of departments - how much money  we  can  get  -  to  a
focus on the outcomes. For the first  year,  this  year,  the  Estimates  of
National Expenditure included measurable objectives. They aren't  there  for
filling pages but they are there for parliamentary oversight. I  would  like
to repeat  that  appeal  to  this  House:  to  exercise  that  oversight  by
utilising the information supplied. Certainly,  as  we  prepare  the  Budget
documentation for next year, this is already an  invitation  to  members  of
this House to  look  at  those  measurable  objectives  for  next  year  and
evaluate them against performance  in  this  year.  Similarly,  the  monthly
expenditure figures - which are published quarterly and are  very  important
for the NCOP - of  actual  expenditures  of  provincial  governments  become
important in recasting the Budget going forward.
The hon Botha commented on the issue of jobs. Let's just  stand  aside  from
jobs as they occur in the South African economy and remind ourselves, for  a
moment, about the trends in the global economy.  The  first  point  to  make
about this is  that  the  global  economy  is  now  marked  by  very  severe
imbalances. In the United States, the largest  economy  in  the  world,  the
fiscal deficit for the current year, which is called Fiscal 2004 in the  US,
would be 4,6% of the GDP - this from the surplus of  1,2%  just  four  years
ago. Also, the balance of payments will see a deficit of some  5,3%  of  GDP
in the United States. They have sapped savings from everywhere else  in  the
world. In the year 2000 it was about US$1,2 trillion. It's down now  and  so
they are sitting with this huge uncovered position. It's  a  country  living
beyond its means and it poses an enormous risk to the  rest  of  the  global
economy.

Similarly, events in Brussels earlier this  week  focused  very  sharply  on
problems in  Europe.  The  two  largest  economies  in  Europe,  France  and
Germany, are living beyond their means and outside of the  rules  agreed  to
within the stability pact which gave rise to the European Central  Bank  and
indeed  the  single  currency  for  Europe.  So  there,  too,  are  enormous
problems, and the Japanese economy remains very deeply in a quagmire.

So, in this environment, South Africa is battling to improve on  the  living
standards of all our people, and battling to  get  up  growth  levels.  It's
very hard because very clearly global demand patterns are down and this  has
a profound impact on what we produce and what we export. But, against  that,
because we are a resource-strong economy, our currency  is  appreciating  in
leaps and bounds. Thus, we have this  contradiction.  It's  not  a  uniquely
South African contradiction but it is an outcome and  consequence  of  these
enormous imbalances in the global economy.

The third quarter growth numbers  that  were  published  earlier  this  week
were, of course, also marked by one element that has shown  huge  isolation,
and that is agricultural output. This was largely as a result  of  the  fact
that the rains have been as unpredictable as they have thus  far  this  year
in  comparison  with  last  year.  So,  our  own  growth  numbers  are  down
substantially. Those issues of the context are important.

Our commitment, I think, is therefore based on a number of  issues.  One  of
them is a question and it remains  an  open  question:  What  would  be  the
nature of jobs going forward? How  many  jobs  can  an  economy  like  South
Africa provide for, granted that we have a very peculiar  history  that  has
seen a very bad set of distortions relating to skill? So, what kind of  jobs
will there be in this economy going forward?

It's very important that we talk about these issues  because  I  think  that
they are our collective concerns. They are our collective concerns,  because
they can't be used by anybody to make silly promises ahead of  an  election.
They are big issues. They are going to remain big issues now  and  they  are
going to remain big issues before the 2009  elections.  They  are  going  to
remain big  issues  everywhere  in  the  world,  because  the  processes  of
manufacturing have changed as radically as they have.

So it's important that we talk about these issues, because I think  we  have
collective responsibility for the lives of especially young people who  make
up the vast majority of the  unemployed.  It's  in  this  context  that  the
issues of training are as important as  they  are.  I  am  sure  that  every
member of this House  would  be  very  familiar  with  the  address  of  the
President some two weeks ago, on 11 November, to  the  National  Council  of
Provinces where he spelt out in some detail our commitment  to  an  expanded
Public Works programme.

However, I want to add to what the President said. In the same  spirit  that
the hon Botha addressed this issue, a lot of these programmes would  be  run
quite locally. So the nature of constituency work changes radically  because
communities need to identify with these initiatives. Zenzeleni doesn't  work
unless there is an empowerment of local communities. The  responsibility  of
members of Parliament is  to  be  involved  in  that  empowerment  of  local
communities. To ensure that proposals can be drafted, and to ensure that  we
can take these very expensive consultants out of play  become  part  of  our
commitment to democracy. So  ensuring  that  we  can  deal  with  the  worst
ravages of unemployment and poverty in constituencies that we  represent  is
an important part of constituency work going forward.

She also spoke about whites feeling displaced. I think that those views  may
be somewhat dated. When we addressed the National Assembly  on  12  November
when we tabled the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement, I  spoke  about  the
views of one of the largest removal companies  in  South  Africa  which  can
comment very favourably on the turnaround. In the  80s  and  the  early  90s
they were taking lots of people out of this country. By  2001-02,  they  had
reached a point of equilibrium. Now, for the first time, they  are  bringing
many more people into South Africa than they are taking out of the  country.
Many of those are in fact amongst what  the  removal  companies  would  call
``many happy returns''. Those are South  Africans  who  have  lived  abroad,
tasted that life, want to return, bring their skills back, and find  comfort
and security here in South Africa. I think that that would be the  shape  of
things to come in the future.

Let me conclude by saying that I was quoted as having given 19  February  as
the date of the Budget to be tabled in the National Assembly. That was  said
by me in error. The date  of  the  Budget  to  be  tabled  in  the  National
Assembly is 18 February. I would like to just correct that  for  the  record
and also for the benefit of members here, and advise that the  work  of  the
Joint Budget Committee would be  taken  into  account  as  we  firm  up  the
numbers and sharpen our positions, not for  an  election  Budget.  We  don't
need that, we need to look long beyond the election. Our commitment  is  not
just to a set of election manifestos; it is to the people  of  South  Africa
who  should  be  the  beneficiaries  of  democracy.  The  poorest  and  most
vulnerable of our people remain the object whom we are here to serve.

Those commitments remain and, as we argued the other day, I  must  say  here
that the trend line is organic. As Government improves, so does the  ability
to absorb resources, and to measurably improve on  the  objectives  and  the
outcomes of the resources received; and so, too, can we spend  more  wisely.
The trend line now is the one that was established some years  ago,  but  we
need a firm hand to ensure that the absorption rate for financial  resources
improves. That is very much in evidence in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement. But, members of the Joint Budget Committee certainly got  a  fair
grip of that in engagement both with officials of the National Treasury  and
also with officials from other departments, and outsiders  who  participated
in those hearings.

I would like to thank the committee, once  again,  for  its  work,  for  the
maturing of the process and for the quality of advice  received.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I shall now put the question in respect of  the
First Order. The question is that the report be agreed to. The  decision  is
dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution.  I  acknowledge  that
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their  provinces'  vote.
If there is any delegation that feels it is headless, it should indicate  so
now.

In accordance with Rule 71 I shall first allow provinces an  opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote  if  they  wish  to  do  so.  Is  there  any
province wishing to make a declaration of vote? There is  none.  We  proceed
to voting on the question.  We  will  do  this  in  alphabetical  order  per
province. Eastern Cape? Is Eastern Cape headless?

Ms B N DLULANE: Eastern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Free State?

Mr T RALANE: Supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Gauteng supports.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, Minister and delegates, just like any budget,  our
national  Budget  often  requires  adjustment.  This  could  mean  that  the
executive  appeals  to  Parliament  for  increased   allocations   to   some
programmes, decreases in others or a shifting of funds between Votes  -  all
in terms of the appropriations passed by Parliament in February this year.

Of course, the Public Finance Management Act limits the  kinds  of  requests
that  departments  are  permitted  to  make  for  additional  funding.  Most
requests  for  additional  funding  are,  by  and  large,  for   emergencies
considered unforeseen and unavoidable.

This year  the  following  amounts  require  the  approval  of  this  House:
R103 million  for  the  Department  of  Home   Affairs,   mainly   for   the
unanticipated costs of the Lindela Detention Centre and for the  current  ID
campaign in preparation for the national elections  next  year;  R34 million
for the rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure in the  Western  Cape
and  KwaZulu-Natal  municipalities;  R180 million  for  Public   Works   for
unanticipated  rates  and  municipal  charges  owing  on  state  properties;
R90 million for the Department  of  Health  to  begin  implementation  of  a
broader treatment plan  for  HIV  and  Aids;  R27 million  for  Correctional
Services for unanticipated increases in the cost of health care  for  prison
inmates, transport  costs  and  urgent  repair  work,  among  other  things;
R500 million to meet the unanticipated costs of the Defence Vote of Phase  3
of the United Nations peace  mission  in  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the
Congo, for South Africa's participation in the Burundi  peace  mission,  and
for  provision  for   support   of   the   UN-mandated   Interim   Emergency
Multinational Force from June to  August  this  year;  R36 million  for  the
Agriculture Vote in order  to  combat  foot-and-mouth  disease  and  provide
emergency fodder assistance to farmers in the Limpopo province;  R50 million
for the Communications Vote to meet the unanticipated costs of  the  closure
of the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation and  for  the  settlement  of
liabilities of the Independent Communications Authority of  SA;  R20 million
for the Department of Transport to  meet  urgent  road  repair  costs  at  a
number of border posts; and R346 million for  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,
mainly to provide a ready response to forest fires, to meet emergency  water
supplies in  drought-affected  communities,  to  settle  unrecoverable  debt
obligations  of  several  water-user   associations,   and   to   meet   the
restructuring  costs   associated   with   the   transfer   of   staff   and
infrastructure to municipalities and other entities.

Hon members should note that an amount of  R400 million  has  been  provided
for members of Parliament and members of provincial legislatures who do  not
return to elected office, or who leave  their  seats.  Such  representatives
will  receive  a  supplementary  service  benefit   equivalent   to   annual
pensionable salary for a completed term of service, up to a maximum  of  two
terms.

The Adjustments Appropriation Bill also provides  for  R1,1 billion  in  the
approved roll-over of moneys unspent by national departments in 2002-03.  In
total,  R5,4 billion  in  additional  expenditure  is  proposed,  of   which
R2,5 billion will go directly to provinces.

On behalf of our committee, I commend  the  2003  Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill for approval by the NCOP. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance  and  colleagues,  as  I
mentioned in my address to this House exactly 17  months  ago,  on  26  June
last year, and at a similar occasion the year before, it  becomes  necessary
once in a while to neatly tie a collection of amendments  to  a  variety  of
facts, and more specifically so when these refer to tax matters.

Today is no different from last year or the year before,  for  that  matter.
The Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  of  2003,  which  was  introduced  on  18
November 2003, aims to give effect  to  all  outstanding  tax  proposals  as
outlined in the 2003 Budget and to amend all related Acts.

The present Bill, contained in a hefty document of no less  than  138  pages
and 226 clauses, introduces amendments to Acts, varying  from  the  Transfer
Duty Act of 1949 to the Exchange Control Amnesty and Amendment  of  Taxation
Laws Act of 2003, and even amends the Revenue Laws  Amendment  Act  of  2001
and the Second Revenue Laws Amendment Act of 2001.

A new, comprehensive corporate reorganisation regime  was  introduced  on  1
October 2001. This regime was modified and clarified in  2002,  in  response
to taxpayers' comments.  The  modified  regime  came  into  operation  on  6
November, 2002. A few issues, however, remained unresolved and, in order  to
remedy any remaining minor issues, the National Treasury and Sars  requested
public comment with respect  to  the  corporate  reorganisation  regime  and
collateral, related amendments regarding issues that  involve  clarification
of ambiguities, removal  of  inconsistencies  and  changes  to  reflect  the
corporate reorganisation regime's initial intent.

While  some  of  the  clauses  are  repetitive  and  most  of  the  proposed
amendments merely refine the present  regime  or  clarify  aspects  thereof,
others are more substantive. The proposals regarding  elective  relief,  the
ring-fencing of trading stock and financial instruments,  the  treatment  of
financial-instrument-holding companies and unbundling transactions are  more
substantive. The limited time at my disposal, however, does not allow me  to
go into any detail. I will  now  proceed  to  highlight  some  of  the  more
significant amendments.

In clause 86(b), it is proposed that a personal liability be  introduced  in
respect  of  employees'  tax  for  representative  employers,  as  well   as
directors or shareholders who control  or  are  regularly  involved  in  the
management  of  the  company's  overall  financial  affairs.   International
experience has shown that the imposition of personal liability  on  officers
and shareholders of a company is  an  effective  procedure  to  prevent  the
misuse or misappropriation of funds collected on behalf of the state.

Clause 134 proposes an amendment to section 6 of the Customs and Excise  Act
of 1964, which relates to the powers of the commissioner to prescribe or  to
appoint, inter alia, places where degrouping depots for  air  cargo  may  be
established, while clause 136 refers to the provision for the liability  for
duty of a degrouping depot operator and  the  circumstances  in  which  such
liability ceases.

The proposed amendment of section 35(a) of the Customs  and  Excise  Act  of
1964, clause 135, is intended to assist the commissioner in  curtailing  the
smuggling of cigarettes and will enable him or her to make  rules  regarding
distinguishing marks and numbers which must or must not appear on  cigarette
containers, in addition to the existing provision for a stamp impression.

In   clause   137,   the   words,   ``International   Trade   Administration
Commission'', replace the words, ``Board of Tariffs and  Trade'',  in  terms
of the International Trade Administration Act of 2002.

Clause 147 causes a new chapter XA to be inserted after  chapter  X  in  the
Customs and Excise Act of 1964. Part A provides for internal  administrative
appeals and an appeal committee  which  will  make  recommendations  to  the
commissioner, while part B provides for an  alternative  dispute  resolution
whereby the Minister of Finance may, after consultation  with  the  Minister
for  Justice,  promulgate  rules  which  may  also  include  categories   of
decisions which are not suitable for alternate dispute resolution.

Clause 166 refers to value-added tax treatment of grants paid by public  and
local  authorities.  When  Government  entities  currently   registered   as
enterprises deregister, they will have to  pay  output  tax  on  the  market
value of their assets, which will result in a circular flow of funds in  the
government sphere. A proviso in section 8(2)  is  proposed  to  prevent  the
operation of the provisions  when  Government  bodies  are  deregistered  in
terms of this Act.

As announced in the 2003  Budget  Review,  the  definition  of  ``a  lending
arrangement'' will be modified to allow for securities  on-lending  as  long
as the loan is not outstanding  for  more  than  12  months.  The  amendment
proposes the replacement of the definition of ``lending  arrangement''.  The
new  definition,  inter  alia,  provides  for  the  on-lending   of   listed
securities and requires the borrower to deliver the securities within a  10-
business-day period after the date of the agreement.

Clauses 199 to 203, as well as  clause  205,  refer  to  Customs  Controlled
Areas or CCAs, and  Industrial  Development  Zones  or  IDZs.  A  number  of
sections which would have to come into operation on  a  date  fixed  by  the
President are being repealed or amended.  These  sections  provide  for  the
licensing of wharfs,  container  terminals,  transit  sheds  and  degrouping
depots.

The various provisions contemplated controlled movement  of  imported  goods
between those licensed premises until delivery  after  due  entry.  It  has,
however, been  found  necessary  to  introduce  licensing  requirements  for
degrouping depots before any of the other  activities  concerned  reach  the
implementation stage. As the introduction of the licensing  requirements  on
a piecemeal  basis  could  lead  to  numerous  amendments  of  the  existing
legislation awaiting implementation, the  provisions  are  repealed  in  the
meantime.

I will now proceed to  read  into  the  record  a  list  of  administrative,
printing and other errors and corrections in respect  of  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill.

On page 11, line 27, to insert (1) before section  3;  page  11,  to  insert
after line 57, (2) subsection (1)(c) ``shall, in so far as  it  deletes  the
reference to sections 9E and 9F, come into operation on  1  June  2004,  and
shall apply in respect of years of assessment commencing on  or  after  that
date"; page 18, line 54, ``controlled'' must be deleted; page 32,  line  25,
words must read, ``commits to the objective of processing";  page  84,  line
47, ``this Act'' must read ``that Act"; page  97,  line  19,  ``by  notice''
should read ``by proclamation"; page 115, lines 1 and 2 should  read,  ``(g)
by the substitution in subparagraph (h)  of  paragraph  (3)  for  the  words
preceding item (i) of the following words"; page 135,  line  51,  add  after
``Income Tax Act, 1962'', the following words,  ``for  the  words  preceding
paragraph (a) of the following words''.

In conclusion, I wish to  thank,  on  behalf  of  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance, our friends from Sars, for the very  clear  explanatory  memorandum
which has made an otherwise very technical Bill perfectly digestible.

On behalf of the Select  Committee  on  Finance,  I  request  the  House  to
support this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

     CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE ON HEARINGS
          CONCERNING PREFERENTIAL PROCUREMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK ACT

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, this is a report  that  the  select  committee
compiled after extensive public hearings  which  were  held  from  8  to  10
September. We just want to thank all the presenters  who  took  interest  to
come before the committee to present. Indeed, they  managed  to  assist  the
committee to do the investigation that we wanted.

I will just outline a few issues that are critical in this report.  I  would
like to highlight to the House what the aim of  the  hearings  was,  in  the
first place. The aim of the hearings was to hear from civil society and  the
industry how the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act has  achieved
its objectives since its inception, and how far it gives effect  to  section
217(2) of the Constitution. The hearings also played a  role  regarding  the
investigations of legislative problem areas  which  may  warrant  Government
intervention in order for the Act to  become  a  key  policy  instrument  to
effectively ensure economic transformation in South Africa.

I would also like to remind members about the few key elements of  what  the
Act says. When applying the Preferential Procurement Policy  Framework  Act,
the relevant institutions  must  consider  the  following:  the  points  for
historically  disadvantaged  individuals  in  terms  of  ownership,  with  a
proviso that the HDIs concerned must be actively involved in the  day-to-day
management  of  that  business;  the  points  for  the  Reconstruction   and
Development Programme goals to be promoted must be clearly specified in  the
tender documents; that goals must be measurable, quantifiable and  monitored
for compliance; the tender must be awarded to  the  bidder  who  scores  the
highest number of  points  unless  sound  reasons  justify  awarding  it  to
another, and this must stand the test of any court of  law;  and,  that  the
bidder's tax status must be in order.

Amongst other  things,  the  regulations  of  the  Preferential  Procurement
Policy Framework Act which were published in 2001 specify that in  contracts
of less  than  R500  000  an  80-20  system  applies,  with  the  price  and
functionality allocated a maximum of  80  points,  and  the  maximum  of  20
points allocated to the historically  disadvantaged  and  other  RDP  goals.
Government thus is willing to pay a 25%  premium  on  these  contracts.  The
second point deals with the 90-10 principles which cover contracts that  are
over R500 000, with price and functionality weighted  at  a  maximum  of  90
points, and the HDIs and other RDP goals scoring a  maximum  of  10  points.
The premium in this instance is 11-11 by Government.

I just want to highlight a few  important  issues  -  having  indicated  and
reminded members of what the Act and regulations  stipulate.  What  we  then
found to be the  prevailing  circumstances  when  we  conducted  the  public
hearings was that there is a lot of fronting. I am sure  that  members  have
heard those kinds of stories that there is ``rent-a-black'' and those  kinds
of things. A situation where blacks  are  put  on  tender  documentation  as
partners in the business, while those individuals are general  employees  or
domestic workers, indicates the practices taking place around tendering  and
highlights the difficulty of promoting policy implementation.  At  the  time
of  tendering,  the  company  profile  is  black  and  owned  by  previously
disadvantaged people but at the time of delivery, the profile  changes.  How
to deal with this problem is still an elusive question.  Once  tenders  have
been awarded, it is often difficult and costly  to  withdraw  these  tenders
despite the fact that the  Act  allows  that  there  must  be  some  process
involved if the tender changes face in the process.

It should be understood that organisations and labour  markets  are  dynamic
and that people move from one company to the next.  Monitoring  systems  are
not in place to counter  these  and  related  fronting  practices.  In  many
respects, the point system facilitates the formation  of  partnerships.  The
quality of those partnerships is therefore questionable  in  many  of  these
instances.

Black ownership, to this date, is  very  narrow.  Special  purpose  vehicles
served up to encourage equity ownership allow for  and  facilitate  fronting
practices, in many cases. It is common to transfer the ownership of a  white
male-owned company into the name of a spouse, in this instance  to  a  white
female because the white male thinks that he is not going to get the  tender
and therefore transfers  ownership  to  a  spouse's  name.  Regarding  white
women, it does not specify and clarify the characteristics required of  such
a woman. In such instances, it is being manipulated because, between me  and
all  other  members,  we   understand   what   we   mean   by   historically
disadvantaged, but people who implement  these  things  find  all  sorts  of
means and mechanisms of manipulating the  system,  and  find  loopholes.  In
this example, they managed to bring in a white woman to be a beneficiary  so
that she could fall under ``historically disadvantaged''.

It should be understood  that  black  companies  also  approach  white-owned
companies and thus promote fronting. Legal  fronting  can  also  be  defined
through the fact that  the  tenderer  is  not  always  the  manufacturer  or
supplier. I think all members can tell different stories  where  people  get
contracts and don't even own a bus, or whatever, in order to  provide  those
services. At the end of the day, when  the  contract  is  awarded,  a  white
company then takes responsibility and  executes  that  task.  I  think  that
creates a problem.

One of the presenters who came before the committee from  Armscor  commented
in their submission that most companies previously owned by  nonhistorically
disadvantaged individuals have now  restructured  their  companies  and  are
changing ownership of these companies to  give  them  to  relatives  and  so
forth. From Armscor's presentation, it could be  established  that  this  is
happening mainly in the arms industry. A key element of fronting is that  it
is designed to meet empowerment criteria for the purposes  of  a  particular
contract while holding back on genuine  institutional  transformation.  This
may involve the criteria of ad hoc artificial bidding entities to  meet  the
PPPFA and black economic empowerment  criteria.  This  may  involve  only  a
small part of the business operation and the HDI representation  in  such  a
segment will appear less significant when set against an entire operation.

One of the things that we want to highlight as a difficulty  is  a  scenario
where you find state-owned enterprises or independent bodies, such  as  your
SABC, who will find every opportunity or loophole not  to  want  to  procure
goods in South Africa. The excuse that is given by the  SABC  is  that  they
are a broadcasting corporation. We do not get adequate answers when  we  ask
them to indicate to us where exactly the Act prohibits them from not  buying
goods overseas.

The Act also provides that if an entity  or  state  organ  cannot  find  the
goods that they need in South Africa, they  can  then  be  exempted  by  the
Minister through publication in the Government Gazette. They do not do  this
but want, in the process, to find all sorts of mechanisms and loopholes  not
to fall within the Act. If public corporations such as the SABC do not  want
to assist the historically disadvantaged in the  procurement  of  goods  and
services, I don't know what we then expect from other  people  who  are  not
part of the Public Service.

The other problems around the implementation concerns a lot of  difficulties
that were noted by  the  Treasury.  These  difficulties  in  particular  are
around the laborious calculation processes, ie when  you  either  deal  with
the 90-10 or 80-20 principle, you have  to  engage  in  tedious  calculation
processes. The other important element which I also  need  to  highlight  is
that, as we all know, the Act was passed in 2000 and between 2000 and now  a
lot of policy development has taken place, including the passing of the  BEE
strategy and the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Bill in  Parliament.
So all those things make  it  difficult  for  the  alignment  to  happen  in
implementing procurements. The committee, amongst other  things,  recommends
that we make sure that, in going forward, there  is  some  consideration  by
the Treasury and DTI that there must be alignment within these  policies  so
that people who are out there who want  to  find  loopholes  do  not  choose
interpretations that suit them more than the others.

One other element that the Act provides for is the empowerment of women  and
youth, in particular, around  historical  disadvantage.  We  noted,  in  the
submission by the  Treasury  regarding  what  has  happened  practically  to
people who have been given contracts, that the majority of those people  are
not necessarily women nor are they youth. It  is  therefore  important  that
the Treasury considers putting systems in place  within  this  decentralised
system that you are going  to  have  in  all  departments.  But,  a  guiding
framework and a database must be kept which are going  to  clearly  indicate
whether those are black women,  white  women  or  youth  and  give  a  clear
classification regarding the nature of those companies. As things stand  now
and from the information that we were  given  by  the  Treasury,  Government
departments and provinces, it is difficult to know and understand  how  many
women have benefited from the  process,  and  how  many  young  people  have
benefited. So these are the kinds of  issues  that  I  think  Treasury  must
consider very carefully and be able to give some guidance on.

As I conclude, I would like to say that we made some  recommendations  as  a
committee, because the report is very lengthy. One  of  them  was  that  the
alignment must take place within all these  policies  between  the  DTI  and
National Treasury, and that there must be some uniformity.  Where  there  is
ambiguity in any of the Acts, particularly around the RDP goals ...

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order: I want to know  if
it is in order for an  hon  member  to  read  magazines  during  the  debate
session.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I  think  it's  certainly  not  in  order.  Hon
members should be paying attention to the business of the House.  The  House
is not a reading room. So I would ask hon members  to  desist  from  reading
newspapers or magazines in the House. Proceed, hon Mahlangu.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Thank you, Chairperson. Also, we  propose  that  mechanisms
should be put in place to assist officials  and  practitioners  with  proper
interpretation and implementation of the Act. We also propose  that  company
premises should be visited before tenders are awarded as  suggested  by  the
Armscor presentation, because you find that you award a  tender  but  people
have not gone out to look whether that  company  indeed  exists  or  whether
they really operate in the  stated  premises.  So  we  propose  that  before
tenders are awarded, there must be  people  who  go  out  there  to  do  the
physical inspection. We  also  propose  that  closed  tender  processes  are
needed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I shall now put the question. The  question  is
that the report be agreed to.  The  decision  is  dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution. We note that  delegation  heads  are  indeed
present in the Chamber. We would first allow  provinces  an  opportunity  to

                                 LIQUOR BILL

                           (Consideration of Bill)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, in the  first  instance  I  want  to  donate  nine
minutes of my 10 minutes to you, to use at your own discretion,  as  I  need
only one minute. [Laughter.]

We will remember that this House passed the  Liquor  Bill  with  amendments,
and that's my emphasis, on 8 October this year. Because we had  amended  the
Bill, it was  referred  back  to  the  National  Assembly  to  consider  our
amendments. The  National  Assembly  approved  all  our  amendments,  except
clause 6(2), which reads, and I quote:  ``A  person  must  not  manufacture,
sell or supply any potent substance.''

Their view was that it must read as follows, and I quote:  ``A  person  must
not manufacture, sell or supply as liquor''  -  that's  my  emphasis  -  any
``potent substance.''

In other words, they argued that there must be an  addition  of  two  words,
which are, ``as liquor''. The  Bill  was  then  referred  to  the  mediation
committee on 18 November, where it was agreed that we add  the  words,  ``as
liquor'' to clause 6.

We are still committed to what we presented to this House, that among  other
things,  liquor  is  a  potentially  dangerous  substance   and   that   its
manufacture, distribution and retail cannot just be left to  market  forces.
There is a need for us to regulate it. However, the amendments agreed to  by
the mediation committee do not change the real essence of the Bill. We  want
to urge this House to adopt the mediated version of the Bill. I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I believe, hon member, that you  stole  one  of
the minutes you donated to me. [Laughter.]

I shall now put the question. The question is that the Bill  be  agreed  to.
Again,  we  deal  with  the  decision  in  terms  of  section  65   of   the
Constitution. Is there any province wishing to make a declaration  of  vote?
There is none. We proceed to voting on the question. Eastern Cape?

                    ELECTORAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                   JUDICIAL MATTERS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, as usual, this committee did  a  very  thorough
job in respect of this Bill, which one can call an omnibus Bill.  We  nearly
refused, as a committee, to entertain the briefing by  the  department  when
they did not have available the existing legislation to be  amended  at  the
first briefing. However, under the leadership  of  our  fair,  accommodating
chairperson we agreed to do that and go ahead. I must say  that  after  that
they have been extremely helpful, and we wish to  really  thank  them  as  a
committee for being so helpful and assisting us with this.

The Bill deals with various amendments to  various  Acts,  inter  alia,  the
Administration  Amendment  Act,  the  Insolvency  Act,  the  Prevention   of
Counterfeiting of Currency Act, the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  the  Divorce
Act, the Maintenance Act, the Mediation in Certain Divorce Matters  Act  and
the Promotion of Access to Information Act.

During the course of deliberations on  the  Bill,  the  committee  raised  a
number  of  questions  regarding  certain  courses.  And  because  of   time
restraints, we requested the department to report back to the  committee  on
these issues as early as possible during the next year's session,  of  2004,
and where necessary to submit appropriate  legislative  proposals.  I  could
just refer to a few of these matters.

Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 60 of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  by
obliging presiding officers to take a pretrial services report into  account
during bail proceedings if such a report is  available.  The  purpose  of  a
pretrial services report is  to  assist  the  court  in  making  a  decision
regarding the release of a person on bail.

The committee notes  the  request  from  the  portfolio  committee  in  this
regard, that is that the department should undertake  a  feasibility  study.
This committee requests the department, during this  feasibility  study,  to
also look into the linkages between the pretrial services  project  and  the
Automated Fingerprinting Identification System  project  mentioned  here.  I
note in the report that Afis is spelt wrongly. It should be Afis. It is  the
Automated Fingerprinting Identification System and not Aphis.

In the process  they  should  undertake  a  cost-benefit  analysis  of  both
projects to  ensure  that  scarce  resources  will  not  be  inappropriately
utilised if there is a duplication of  processes,  or  if  the  one  project
seems to be better placed than the other to achieve the goals set out.

Clause  5  aims  to  establish  legal   certainty   regarding   correctional
supervision as a sentencing option in respect of all offences. While  we  as
a committee endorse the amendment in principle, we requested the  department
to consider and submit a manual amendment to the proviso  contained  in  the
clause as soon as circumstances permit, to the effect that a court  may  not
impose the punishments referred to in the  said  section  if  the  court  is
obliged to impose a sentence contemplated in section 51 of the Criminal  Law
Amendment Act, and not if the court intends to do so.

Clause 6 of the Bill entitles victims of  crime  -  an  extremely  important
provision - when the accused person in question is considered for parole  or
correctional supervision by a  parole  board,  to  have  a  say.  Whilst  we
welcome a provision of this  nature,  the  committee  raised  the  following
questions: Firstly, why is this right only limited to victims of  crime  who
are actually physically present when  the  sentence  is  imposed?  Secondly,
should a mechanism not be put in place in the legislation that  will  ensure
the confidentiality surrounding the identity and whereabouts of  any  victim
who supplies his or her name and address?

We requested the department to take these issues up with the  Department  of
Correctional Services and to address them by way of appropriate  legislative
proposals, which must be submitted to  Parliament  at  the  first  available
opportunity next year. And we feel very strongly about this question of  the
identity of victims and that there should be  no  chance  or  risk  of  them
being intimidated.

We  requested  the  department,  depending  on  the  enactment  of  amending
legislation, to deal with confidentiality of victims and, when  implementing
the legislation, to put administrative measures  in  place  to  ensure  that
confidentiality is maintained.

Another clause  which  I  must  mention  is  clause  11,  which  deals  with
provisions of the Divorce Act,  revolving  around  the  sharing  of  pension
benefits on divorce. I think this is  also  extremely  important  especially
for, in most instances, women.

The committee requests the department  to  investigate  the  possibility  of
allowing the spouse who is not a member of a pension fund to gain access  to
her or his share of the pension benefit at the  time  of  divorce,  and  not
only when the pension benefits eventually - and sometimes maybe  20  or  30-
years' time - accrue to the spouse who is a member of a fund.

The last clause that we refer to  is  clause  25,  which  is  an  empowering
provision allowing the Minister for Justice,  when  making  regulations,  to
criminalise any act or omission  contemplated  in  the  regulations  dealing
with manuals as contemplated in the Promotion of Access to Information Act.

We, as a committee,  while  recognising  the  fact  that  numerous  Acts  of
Parliament and  subordinate  legislation  already  empower  members  of  the
executive to make regulations which criminalise various acts  or  omissions,
raised the concern regarding the desirability of creating offences in  terms
of subordinate legislation, which is not easily  accessible  to  members  of
the public. We consequently requested the department, or possibly  even  the
SA  Law  Reform  Commission,  to  initiate   an   investigation   into   the
desirability and even  the  constitutionality  of  all  provisions  of  this
nature on this Statute Book.

We, of course, recommend that the House accept this Judicial Matters  Second
Amendment Bill, which deals with various amendments to various  Acts,  as  I
pointed out. As you can see, we as a  committee  really  thoroughly  applied
our minds to this Bill in hand. Thank you, very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  I've  been
informed that there will be one debate in respect of Orders 9 to 14.

                        TRANSNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
 AFFAIRS - PROTOCOL AGAINST THE ILLICIT MANUFACTURING OF AND TRAFFICKING IN
   FIREARMS, THEIR PARTS AND COMPONENTS AND AMMUNITION, SUPPLEMENTING THE
       UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, if one looks at the Order Paper, it appears  that
my task to deal with  six  reports  in  five  minutes  is  a  daunting  one.
However, due to the generosity of the Chief Whip - I don't know if  it's  Mr
Tolo's minutes he has reallocated to me - I have some more time. Also,  it's
not as bad as it seems because the six reports  from  the  select  committee
deal with  one  United  Nations  convention  which  is  the  United  Nations
Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and three  protocols  which
are  in  fact  supplementary  to  the  convention.  Clearly,  then,  it   is
appropriate to deal with these six reports in one statement.

Due to the time constraints, I will not deal with every technical aspect  of
the convention and the three protocols.  I  will  simply  try  and  give  an
overview of the convention and  the  three  protocols  that  supplement  the
convention.

The purpose of the convention is to promote  international  co-operation  to
prevent and combat  transnational  organised  crime  more  effectively.  The
convention deals with  four  specific  crimes:  participation  in  organised
criminal groups; money-laundering; corruption; and obstruction  of  justice.
Our domestic law already caters for the four crimes just  mentioned.  It  is
important to note that the convention requires liability  for  these  crimes
to extend to legal persons. This is an  important  provision  because  crime
bosses  have  increasingly  used  companies  to   facilitate   transnational
organised crime.

The convention  requires  state  parties  to  empower  courts  or  competent
authorities to make  available  or  seize  bank  or  financial  records  and
prohibits a state party from hiding behind bank secrecy laws.

Co-operation in terms of the  convention  includes  extradition  and  mutual
legal assistance. The convention requires  that  participating  states  take
measures within their means to assist and protect  members  covered  by  the
convention. This has been interpreted to mean  that  a  participating  state
must implement legislative procedures that  would  allow  victims  to  claim
compensation from the perpetrators of crimes defined in the convention.  The
convention further requires  states  that  are  developed  to  provide  less
developed participating states with expertise, resources or  both  in  order
to allow the developing states to implement the convention properly.

Protocol one supplements the convention. Its main purpose is to prevent  and
combat trafficking in persons especially women and children and  further  to
protect and assist the victims of such trafficking.  The  protocol  requires
participating states to establish the crime of trafficking in persons.  Here
I must refer to the select committee's second report on the first  protocol.
At this point, South Africa does not have any legislation that  criminalises
trafficking in persons. I must therefore draw the attention of the House  to
the resolution proposed in the second report on the first protocol that  the
Government  fulfil  its  obligation  and  pass   legislation   criminalising
trafficking in persons within three months of adopting this resolution.

The first protocol  requires  participating  states  to  consider  providing
assistance to victims of trafficking in persons. It does not oblige a  state
to provide this assistance,  but  urges  participating  states  to  consider
providing appropriate housing, counselling and information on legal  rights,
medical and psychological and material assistance as well as employment  and
education  opportunities.  Our  law  must  also  allow  victims   to   claim
compensation from perpetrators. But the state is not obliged to establish  a
compensation fund for victims under the protocol.

Protocol two also supplements the convention and its purpose is  to  prevent
and combat the smuggling of migrants and  to  promote  co-operation  amongst
participating states to combat such  smuggling.  This  protocol  adopts  the
position that migrants shall not be liable  to  criminal  prosecution  under
this  protocol.  The  protocol  requires  the  adoption  of  legislation  to
establish the smuggling of migrants as a criminal offence.  Here,  again,  I
must draw  the  House's  attention  to  the  second  report  of  the  select
committee on protocol  two.  At  present  there  is  no  domestic  law  that
criminalises the smuggling of migrants and again three months  are  provided
to rectify the position. Participating  states  are  required  within  their
available means to tighten up on border  controls,  to  prevent  and  detect
smuggling of migrants. Participating states are required to co-operate  with
the return of smuggled migrants.

Protocol three also supplements the convention and aims to  prevent,  combat
and  eradicate  the  elicit  manufacturing  and  trafficking  in   firearms.
Participating  states  are  required  to  have  in  place  legislation  that
criminalises the illegal manufacture  and  trafficking  in  firearms,  their
parts and components as well as ammunition;  and  also  to  criminalise  the
falsifying or obliterating, removing or altering of marks on  firearms.  Our
domestic law is fully compliant with this protocol. There are  a  number  of
technical requirements relating to licensing and maintenance of  records  in
the protocol. Regarding the convention and the  three  protocols  concerned,
we  recommend  its  adoption  with  one  reservation  in  respect   of   the
jurisdiction of the International Court of  Justice.  The  report  makes  it
clear that the reservation is a temporary measure that  will  stand  as  and
until  the  Government  has  given  its  consideration  to  the   compulsory
jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.

It is therefore my honour to  urge  this  House  to  adopt  the  convention,
protocols and reports  of  the  select  committee  on  that  convention  and
protocols. Thank you. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Lever. I shall now  put
the question in respect of the Ninth Order. The question is that the  report

therefore declare the report agreed to.

Report  accordingly  adopted  in  accordance  with   section   65   of   the
Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
     AFFAIRS - PROTOCOL ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT (SADC) TRIBUNAL
 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
  AFFAIRS - AGREEMENT AMENDING THE PROTOCOL ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
                               (SADC) TRIBUNAL

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chair, I have been requested by Oom  Dawie  not  to  speak,
but that request is not acceded to.

The object of the protocol before this House is to constitute the  tribunal.
You will recall that in terms of article nine of the SADC treaty,  provision
is made for the establishment of SADC institutions,  one  of  which  is  the
tribunal.

Article  16(1)  of  that  treaty  indicates  that  the  tribunal  shall   be
constituted to  ensure  adherence  to,  and  proper  interpretation  of  the
provisions of the treaty which we are talking about. Article  16(2)  of  the
same treaty provides that the composition, powers, functions, procedure  and
other related matters governing  the  tribunal  shall  be  prescribed  in  a
protocol which should be adopted at a summit.
The protocol is before this hon House, and on 7  August  2000  in  Windhoek,
Namibia, heads of state signed this protocol. We are therefore calling  upon
this honourable House, which  I  had  forgotten  to  greet  from  corner  to
corner, but I will do that next time around, to ratify this  treaty.  I  can
assure you, I can put my  head  on  a  block,  that  no  provision  of  this
protocol is in conflict with any  of  our  domestic  laws,  or  any  of  the
international laws. It is therefore  correct  that  we  should  ratify  this
protocol.

I like the second part, because it is very long. Listen to  me,  and  listen
carefully, we are requesting you and the hon House to approve the  agreement
amending the protocol. Those amendments are technical, that is why they  are
long. What we want to do is to delete the words `` states''  and  ``state'';
and substitute it with the words ``member  states''  and  ``member  state'',
because we want to make it very clear  that  we  are  talking  about  member
states.

What we want this  House  to  do  is  to  approve  what  I  have  requested.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I shall  now  put  the

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT RULES COMMITTEE - IMPLEMENTATION OF
    RECOMMENDATIONS OF JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

The CHIEF WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  the  Constitution  and  its
founding principles enjoins this Parliament and Government  to  ensure  that
they operate in an accountable manner,  and  that  Parliament  oversees  the
actions of the  executive,  and  that  the  executive,  as  well  as  public
representatives, act in a manner that is transparent and responsive.

The  question  that  we  have  to  ask,  as  members  of   Parliament,   and
particularly  members  of  this  Council,  is  whether,  in  terms  of   the
provisions of the Constitution, we have complied with the  dictates  of  the
Constitution  and  whether,  in  fact,  we  have  promoted   oversight   and
accountability   as   quite   central   to   our   activities   as    public
representatives.

In order to respond to that, one has to only look  at  the  Order  Paper  of
today. For example, we had the Presidency account to Parliament in terms  of
an issue to which it responded, a compelling issue, and  that  is  combating
violence against women and children. The Presidency was available here,  and
in a very transparent manner, accounted to this particular Council. We  also
had the Deputy Minister for Justice.
If we look more closely at the Order Paper, we also  find  that  there  were
public hearings that were held by the Committee  on  Finance.  This  was  in
relation to the procurement preference policy. This meant  that  Parliament,
in terms of its activities, ensured that it reached out to  the  people  and
allowed public opinion to shape its reports and determinations. This  matter
is debated in Parliament, and again here is an exercise of transparency  and
inclusivity. It is a people-driven process. I think the Council  must  again
be commended for it.

If  you  look  at  the  penultimate  item  on  the  Order  Paper,  it's  the
consideration of the report on the visit by the ad hoc committee,  led  ably
by the Chairperson of Committees Ms Joyce Kgoali, to Mafikeng, the  province
that I come from. This is  in  terms  of  a  constitutional  provision.  The
Constitution enjoins the NCOP to act as arbiter when intervention  is  made,
either by provinces  in  local  government,  or  where  national  Government
intervenes in the activities of local government to ensure that there  is  a
respect for the integrity of the different spheres of government,  but  more
importantly to ensure that the intervention that occurs is  legitimate.  The
NCOP then acts as an arbiter.

Did we, in fact, fulfil our constitutional obligation? The answer must be  a
huge yes. Not only did we go to the province  as  a  multiparty  delegation,
report to our peers in the ATC, and report back to the  House,  but  we  are
now debating it, in full view of the public, to ensure that we  promote  the
transparency that our Constitution enjoins us to do.

I do not wish to repeat the contents of  the  ATC  report,  but  I  want  to
acknowledge and recognise the role played by the co-chairperson of the  NCOP
to this joint committee, Mrs Nkuna, who is ill today, and has not  therefore
been able to participate in this debate.  We  also  have  to  recognise  the
contributions of Mr Lawrence Lever and the task team that put together  this
very comprehensive, and I think, very meticulous report on  this  particular
issue, as well as Mr Matthee and other members who worked as  part  of  that
particular  committee.  I  think  their   contributions   have   been   very
commendable.

We should also say that we have done commendably well in terms of  the  fact
that  we  have  debated  and  discussed  the   issues   of   oversight   and
accountability, which was one of  the  recommendations  of  this  particular
joint committee. If my memory serves me correctly, I think we  have  debated
it on no less than three occasions. So, we have already dealt with that.  It
is also recommended as an immediate step to  be  implemented  that  we  look
very closely at the vision and mission of Parliament.

This has in fact occurred; the NCOP more than six months ago had a  workshop
where it sought to chart out the vision and mission  of  the  NCOP  and  the
other House. It also recommends, amongst other things, that  a  protocol  be
developed to determine the relationship between the NCOP  and  the  National
Assembly committees - the select committees and the portfolio  committees  -
in terms of  the  exercise  of  oversight,  as  well  as  communication  and
interaction  between  the  committees  in  their  role  of   oversight   and
accountability. Whilst we have developed  positive  practices  in  terms  of
that, this has not  been  formalised  and  certainly  this  is  one  of  the
challenges that the new Parliament would face.

I think what is most critical is  that  this  committee  here  had  done  an
extensive amount of work, deliberated very cautiously  and  carefully  about
it, went through the Constitution thoroughly, looked at  the  practices  out
here and came up with recommendations which would provide the  institutional
memory of Parliament with an important document on which the new  Parliament
could base its activity. In other words, they would not  have  to  reinvent,
or start a process anew.

One of the other recommendations of the  joint  committee,  which  was  also
adopted  by  the  Joint  Rules  Committee,  was  that  there  should  be   a
constitutional  landscape  on  oversight  and  accountability.  This   would
derive, amongst other things, from the constitutional  provisions,  as  well
as the practices of the parliaments, the current Parliament, as well as  the
past Parliament, and also  contributions  of  various  stakeholders  in  the
constitution-making process; so that we have  a  comprehensive  balance  and
complete  guide,  which  would  assist   members   of   Parliament,   public
representatives and members of the provincial legislatures  in  doing  their
oversight and accountability work.

There have also been recommendations, which have been approved, of the  fact
that there should be an audit of all  entities  holding  public  power,  and
this would require quite a bit of resources. What is  very  significant,  is
that the recommendations of this committee is that this  process  should  be
driven by the Chairperson of the  NCOP  and  the  Speaker  of  the  National
Assembly who would convene the task team, which would  be  made  up  of  key
stakeholders from all political parties, and it  would  then  designate  the
work to different components that would deal with different areas.

Given the time constraints here, I can only end by saying that, as a  House,
I do believe that we have fulfilled our task  wonderfully  well.  We  should
commend all the members and all the committees for the excellent  work  that
they have done, and also the oversight work,  particularly  with  regard  to
two aspects. The first is the activities during the provincial  weeks  where
Parliament as a whole conducted oversight activity in all nine provinces  at
the same time, was able to compile a consolidated report, and  debated  here
with the Ministers who are accountable in that regard. The  second  -  which
was certainly a highlight of this Council this year,  and  we  must  commend
the presiding officers for this as well as the staff that ably  assisted  in
this particular process - is when Parliament went to the people and  ensured
that it listened and reached out to the people.

I think we have led the way in ensuring that our democracy is an  inclusive,
transparent and responsive one.  I  conclude  by  not  only  commending  the
members that served on this committee, but this House, its chairpersons  and
all its members for the wonderful work that they have  done.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON INTERVENTION IN THE MAFIKENG
                             LOCAL MUNICIPALITY

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, we went and we are back. The question is:  Why
did we go there? We wanted to ascertain as to whether the  intervention  was
necessary or not. We are back because we believe that we have  fufilled  our
mandate.

We were in Mafikeng at the beginning of  October  as  an  ad  hoc  committee
under the capable leadership of that  dynamic,  vibrant  person  called  hon
Joyce Kgoali. Chair, in  Mafikeng  we  met  various  relevant  stakeholders,
amongst those the MEC for local government, his director-general -  in  fact
he was here yesterday - the new mayor, the acting municipal manager who  was
seconded to that municipality by the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government, HODs in that  particular  municipality,  the  municipal  council
itself, organised labour,  Salga,  the  business  community,  Sanco  and  so
forth. We met all of them because we wanted to be sure about what we  wanted
to achieve there.

Now that we are back, we believe that we have fulfilled our mandate. Let  us
tell you, Chair, what we have discovered. I hope that in the  end  all  will
agree with us when we make our recommendations. What we discovered was  that
the budget of that municipality is very low. Before the 2000 elections  that
municipality was only responsible for, should I call it,  the  urban  areas:
Mafikeng, Mmabatho.  After  the  2000  elections  all  villages  surrounding
Mafikeng then became part of this municipality.  Unfortunately,  because  of
some lack of understanding of the administration proper explanation was  not
given to the finance department in order for them to receive  the  necessary
resources, so that they could address the needs of  the  entire  population.
It is against that background that we say that the equitable share does  not
reflect the demographics and the needs of the municipal area.

The municipality has few sources of income and this  impacts  negatively  on
service delivery. We were told, and confirmed,  that  cheques  amounting  to
R1,6 million were dishonoured due to insufficient funds in June  this  year.
The municipality of Mafikeng  missed  the  2003  deadline  for  passing  its
budget. For 2003-04 the municipality budgeted for a deficit of R7,7  million
and Treasury did not approve because it is not allowed. What  we  discovered
is that there is a lack of skills in that particular municipality and  as  a
result people are unable to do what they are supposed to do. I do  not  want
to go into details, because it might take the whole of today to do so.

The municipality also failed to finalise the placement of staff.  What  also
disturbed  the  committee  was  that  the  casual  or  contract  staff  were
appointed at a cost of R268 000 per month, which placed a  heavy  burden  on
the resources of that particular municipality. The personnel costs  of  that
municipality exceed 50%, which is far above the norms and standards  as  set
at national level. The municipal council took a decision that said that  the
overdraft should not exceed R7 million. Unfortunately it did. It  went  from
R7 million to R11 million.

The IDP is not linked to the budget  of  that  municipality.  There  are  no
business plans in place. They could not meet the deadline for June  2003  to
finalise their IDP. They were to finalise it in October. Let  us  hope  they
did so.

The other problem is that the majority of  our  colleagues,  councillors  in
that municipality, are not familiar with the relevant legislation  governing
local government. They are not. They say that they appreciate the work  done
by  Kgoshi  Mokoena  and  his  committee.  The  committee  system  in   that
municipality is not functioning. From 2000-2003 the council did not  receive
information on the financial status of the municipality.

There is no visible service delivery in Mafikeng.  We  are  told  that  from
time to time traffic lights are not  working.  There  is  an  unco-ordinated
approach to land sales. The land register is not accurate.  Their  financial
system has no performance management aspects  in  it.  There  is  a  lot  of
inadequacies in their billing systems. Queries are not adequately  addressed
or resolved. Reports from the Auditor-General are not followed up and  as  a
result, there is a recurrence of the same audit queries. There is a lack  of
community participation. Ward committees are very weak and in some areas  do
not exist at all.

All these happened during the time of the former  mayor  who  has  now  been
dismissed. The former municipal manager is under suspension. The  new  mayor
and the acting municipal manager, when we arrived in  Mafikeng,  were  at  a
filling station. They were saying to  us:  ``We  have  taken  this  car  for
mayoral services. We are happy now that the engine is  operating  very  well
and the top gasket is now ...''

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, please wrap up.

Mr P D N MALOYI: ``We are now going to fill up with fuel and oil. Then  this
car  will  run,''  they  said.  We  agree  with  that.  This  committee   is
recommending that the intervention in Mafikeng should  be  approved.  It  is
necessary to do so and it is the right thing  to  do.  Secondly,  the  MEC's
office should report to this House on a monthly basis about the progress  in
that particular municipality, in order for us to monitor the  implementation
of all recommendations made. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now  put  the  question:  That
the Report be agreed to. As it is dealt with in terms of section 65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their votes. In accordance  with  rule  71  I
shall first allow provinces the opportunity to make  their  declarations  of
vote, if they so wish. We shall now proceed on the question  of  the  voting
in alphabetical order per province.

therefore declare the report agreed to.

  ARRIVE ALIVE: THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SOUTH AFRICANS IN STRIVING TO REDUCE
        ROAD FATALITIES DURING THE FESTIVE SEASON AND ALL YEAR ROUND

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Thank you, Deputy Chair of Chairs.  Arrive  Alive  has  a
simple brief - reduce the number of fatalities and injuries  on  our  roads,
and in even simpler terms the objective is to save  lives.  It  sounds  very
simple indeed.

In order to achieve this, we have  to  reduce  the  number  of  road  safety
infringements which in turn requires that we change  the  behaviour  of  our
road users - drivers, taxi owners, as well as  passengers  and  pedestrians.
At the risk of generalisation, Chairperson, let me say that  in  most  cases
accidents are caused by people: People who fail to maintain  their  vehicles
in good order; people who drive too  fast  or  drive  under  the  influence;
people who cross the roads inappropriately;  people  who  fail  to  maintain
adequate following distances; and people who  make  unrealistic  demands  on
their drivers resulting in many embarking on long journeys  with  as  little
as two hours sleep. We have to change the behaviour of people  in  order  to
save the lives of people.

To illustrate the point, allow me to  ask  rhetorical  questions.  Is  there
anyone in this room today who has not driven at a speed  in  excess  of  the
legal limit? Is there anyone in this room who  has  not  at  the  same  time
driven under the influence, or has close family and friends  who  have  done
so? How many of us, who have  been  passengers  of  speeding  drivers,  have
insisted that the driver pull over? We are all guilty, Chairperson.

Whenever we  see  others  breaking  the  law,  the  first  response  is  let
Government do something about that. What if the tables were turned? What  if
you were the driver that Government should  do  something  about?  How,  for
example, will the  Government  stop  you  from  speeding,  or  drinking  and
driving, or drinking and walking?

The roads will become safer  when  drivers  decide  to  drive  safely,  when
passengers stand up for their rights, and when vehicle owners  honour  their
obligation to maintain their vehicles despite the cost of doing so.  We  all
need to accept co-responsibility for what is happening on our roads.

I urge all South Africans to make road safety an issue in  our  communities,
and to give children the tools to be safe on the road by teaching  them  how
to behave as pedestrians and also as cyclists. Let us all  undertake  to  be
law-abiding road users. Life is too valuable not to.

The recently launched Operation Juggernaut, which is  an  integral  part  of
Arrive Alive, involves provinces and the national Department  of  Transport.
Its focus is merely on driver and vehicle fitness. The idea is  to  surround
our key city or district exit and entry points, with very  tight  roadblocks
which will be manned by traffic officials, the national Defence  Force,  and
the South African Police Service. In order  to  enable  provinces  to  mount
this operation, an amount of R12 million has been allocated to provinces  by
the national Department of Transport.

Operation Juggernaut is an example of increasing  the  risk  of  prosecution
and of  removing  all  unroadworthy  vehicles  from  our  roads.  Since  its
inception, 108 drivers have been  arrested  in  seven  provinces;  37  truck
drivers and 30 minibus-taxi drivers have been  arrested;  93  vehicles  have
been suspended from the road;  220  trucks  and  89  buses  have  also  been
removed; 1000 vehicles were fined for  overloading  and  29  363  fines  for
offences were issued.

However, we cannot block every road and search every vehicle.  We  need  co-
operation from all citizens. There are seven road safety  commandments,  and
failure to observe them lead to sorrow and grief. They are:  do  not  speed;
do not drink and drive; do not drink and walk; do not  overload;  wear  your
seat belt;  ensure  driver  and  vehicle  fitness;  and  promote  pedestrian
safety. If you are not putting on your safety belts and the car is  cruising
at 160 km per hour, then you will also, when the car  crashes,  cruise  from
your seat at 160 km per hour.

It is with great sadness, ladies and gentlemen, hon members, that I  mention
that during the month of October this year we saw several  terrible  crashes
in which many people lost their lives. To mention a few: in  Gauteng,  on  5
October, 14 people died when a truck travelling  down  Potgieter  Street  in
Pretoria hit over two vehicles as a result of brake failure; in KZN,  on  20
October, 18 people died when the driver of a  heavy  vehicle  lost  control,
and most of the elderly people, who were in the queue to receive their  pay,
died; in Mpumalanga, on 26 October, a minibus and a heavy  vehicle  collided
head-on along the N2 between Piet Retief and Pongola, and claimed 14  lives;
and on 30 October 2002  on  the  same  road  there  was  a  similar  vehicle
accident that caused about 12 deaths; and another accident  in  the  Western
Cape also on 30 October. The list is endless, Chairperson, but it  needs  us
all to do something about how we drive.

Chairperson, there are powers that have been given to  traffic  officers  in
relation to overloading control. They are contained in  section  11  of  the
Road Traffic Act of 1989, and also in the Criminal  Procedure  Act  of  1977
which  give  them  the  powers  relating  to  the  arrest,  impoundment  and
confiscation of vehicles that have been overloaded.

Chairperson, it is our duty as South Africans  that  we  arrive  alive,  and
let's educate all South Africans. Let's be patient  on  our  roads.  And  on
behalf of the Select Committee on Public Services I want to wish  all  South
Africans a safe journey home, a safe journey to  their  holidays,  and  come
back alive. Arrive alive. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie debat  oor  ``Arrive  Alive''  kon

Mr Chair, the awareness of road safety is of the utmost importance  at  this
time of the year, especially, if one looks at  the  statistics  released  by
the Department of Transport recently. According to the department there  are
6 million licensed drivers and 6,7 million licensed motorised vehicles  that
travel approximately 140 billion kilometres per year on a  road  network  of
750 000 km, causing over 500 000 traffic accidents per annum,  killing  over
10 000 people per year and mutilating about 18  000.  That  means  that  one
person is killed every 48  minutes,  and  every  four  seconds  an  accident
occurs on our roads, costing  the  country  approximately  R16  billion  per
year.

It is quite clear that a tremendous  challenge  lies  ahead  of  the  Arrive
Alive campaign during the next festive season. The  campaign  was  applauded
in 1998 as one of the best initiatives initiating a positive change  in  the
attitude of road users. That is  so  important,  because  according  to  the
Department of Transport between 80% to 90% of all road  collisions  are  the
result  of  driver  behaviour  like  speeding,   aggression,   recklessness,
negligence, inconsiderate driving and drunken driving.

Today the Arrive Alive  campaign  has  become  an  important  part  of  road
traffic safety projects in South Africa. But,  we  must,  however,  remember
that the Arrive Alive campaign is not the mere function of  one  person,  or
one department, but should be seen as  an  effort  by  the  whole  of  South
Africa to join hands in the promotion of road safety.

Mr Chair, what can we do as citizens? My advice to you is don't  drive  when
you are tired. Don't bluff yourselves. Speed kills and plays a role  in  75%
of all accidents.  Don't  drink  and  drive.  Sixty  percent  of  all  motor
accidents involve alcohol.  Don't  talk  on  your  cellphone  when  you  are
driving. Remember your mind goes out of the car to that person that you  are
talking to. Don't lose your temper, and don't shout ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member, your  time  has
expired.

Dr P J C NEL: Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chairperson and hon  colleagues,  according  to  statistics
provided to the Portfolio Committee on Transport a total of 60 127  vehicles
are  driving  around  with   expired   CRWs,   that   is   certificates   of
roadworthiness - 15 130 heavy passenger transport vehicles, including  buses
and minibus taxis; 24 583 trucks; 20 414 heavy-load trailers.

There are 279 597 unlicensed vehicles. These vehicles, wherever they  are  -
depots, yards, backyards, and garages - must be clamped and not  be  allowed
to  get  onto  our  roads  before  their  licences   and   certificates   of
roadworthiness are in order. The Arrive Alive business plan  must  intensify
law enforcement and control of driver and vehicle fitness aspects.

The Democratic Alliance had long ago suggested  the  use  of  lights  during
daylight driving, and we are happy that the green light has now  been  given
for this. Just as motorcycle accidents have minimised somewhat,  so  we  are
sure there would be fewer road crashes when motor vehicles are also  allowed
to use their lights during their daylight driving.

Road accidents must now be  considered  criminal  acts.  Enough  is  enough.
There must be no holds barred. Strong law enforcement is the  answer.  There
should be no mercy for criminals on the  road.  Commitment  to  road  safety
must become the obligation of every motorist, passenger and pedestrian.  Co-
responsibility of road users to lessen the number  of  crashes  and  spills,
resulting in deaths and serious injuries, must be consciously adopted.

The harnessing of fuel stations on the main highways to help in  advertising
the dangers on the road and alerting motorist to them is most  welcome.  The
involvement of the private sector in helping conscientising  the  road  user
to road safety measures is critical to changing attitudes.

The Democratic Alliance welcomes Operation Juggernaut over  the  next  three
months, including the forthcoming festive season. The  thrust  of  Operation
Juggernaut is more than the supporting of Arrive Alive. The  operation  must
be a  bare-knuckle  confrontation  against  unroadworthy  freight  vehicles,
buses and minibus taxis, unlicensed vehicles,  unlicensed  drivers,  drivers
with expired licences, and drivers under the influence of alcohol.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam  Chairperson  and  the  honourable  House,  the  road
safety measures put in place in the North West province  are  the  strictest
ever. Vehicles are no longer randomly stopped but  are  stopped  on  a  more
regular basis. I have seen drivers sticking their hands  out  to  hand  over
their card drivers' licences even before they are actually  stopped  or  are
demanded to do so by the traffic cops. It seems they already  know  what  is
going to be asked of them.

I am in possession of a ticket of R500 for a head lamp that  failed  when  I
bumped into a pothole. [Interjections.] There  seems  to  be  no  excuse.  A
traffic officer who attends the same church as I do is a  different  man  on
the road. He puts on a different cap to the one he puts on when he  goes  to
church. All this is happening in an attempt to reduce  road  fatalities  and
save lives.

Speeding is certainly one of the contributing factors  that  is  frustrating
the road safety strategy and the Arrive  Alive  campaign.  Many  pedestrians
have lost their lives as a result of speeding, and  very  often  a  speeding
vehicle is less controllable than  a  slow-moving  vehicle.  The  use  of  a
cellphone  while  driving  is  a  distraction  and  has  resulted  in   many
collisions owing to the divided attention of the driver,  something  Dr  Nel
has already alluded to. One is aware that it  has  been  outlawed,  but  its
prohibition has not been vigorously enforced so as to serve as  a  deterrent
to other prospective road users.

Notwithstanding the  above,  I  hope  the  Arrive  Alive  road  strategy  is
certainly going to achieve its purposes in our province this year.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I want to congratulate my  colleagues  on  their
interesting speeches.

I wish to focus on just one aspect, and that  is  the  people  that  do  not
arrive alive. I think there should be an inquiry  into  the  effect  of  the
practice of raising memorials and placing markers and crosses at  the  place
of a severe accident for people that have tragically lost their  lives.  The
people that erect those memorials have mixed  objectives:  to  remember,  to
honour, to warn and to caution. Of course, one's heart goes out to them  and
one has the deepest sympathy for them. But the question is: Do they  achieve
their objectives with these markers?

Along our roads there is a growing forest of crosses. When I drive  home,  I
can see on either side of the road - growing all the  time  -  a  forest  of
crosses and markers. I believe that they are so prevalent  as  to  brutalise
our society and to have the opposite effect from that which was intended.

I have seen groups of cars and people  gathered  dangerously  by  such  road
side group markings in a service, endangering their lives and the  lives  of
other  motorists.  Some  of  these  are  now  permanent  markers,  some  are
gravestones  and  headstones  that  are  a  traffic  hazard.  The   practice
continues along our major roads. Soon it will  be  like  driving  through  a
graveyard when you drive along our roads, and this  cannot  be  right.  This
cannot be good for tourism. It is playing no role, in my view,  in  reducing
fatalities. I can understand, perhaps, people leaving flowers  by  the  road
side after an  accident,  at  the  place  of  a  tragedy  and  even  on  the
anniversary of an accident. But raising  permanent  markers  is  a  practice
that, I think, we should discourage and disallow. They are  distracting  and
depressing, and they are  so  prevalent  as  to  brutalise  rather  than  to
sensitise.

Together with the members of the committee and with Ms  Majodina,  who  made
an  excellent  speech,  the  ACD  has  considered  this  and  supports  this
wonderful programme. We support Operation Juggernaut. It  is  our  hope  and
prayer that everybody will return safely, not  only  alive  but  elected.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

An HON MEMBER: Bathathe mama! [Take them on, mamma!]

Rev M CHABAKU: Angithathi ``niks'' bathathile. [There  is  nothing  to  take
on. They have done that already.]

I completely endorse the previous presentations by my hon  colleagues.  They
have said the bulk of what I wanted to say. I almost have  nothing  to  say,
except to support what they said.

This statement of mine endorses the Arrive Alive campaign. It  is  not  only
for Easter and the festive season of December, but for every  time  and  for
everyone. It is the right of all people to arrive alive  wherever  they  go.
It is especially so for innocent children, the sickly and the  aged  or  the
indigent.

It is time for all people to rise up and make sure that  all  people  arrive
alive. We call on passengers to make a note  of  the  number  plate  of  the
vehicle they are going to ride in and, if the  driver  is  overspeeding,  to
call Arrive Alive and report that driver by giving the registration  number,
the time, where they are and where they are going. Arrive Alive  will  check
immediately in a few seconds where they are and discourage the  driver  from
risking  the  lives  of  all  in  the  vehicle.  Passengers   should   avoid
overloading with children and with big, heavy and bulky baggage  which  make
it hard for vehicles to carry the loads.
We, as parliamentarians, have been actively involved  in  making  sure  that
drivers, owners of vehicles, goods and passengers are safe on the roads.  We
need to also check that the following are roadworthy, and  these  have  been
mentioned before: the brakes, the steering wheel, the tyres  and  what  have
you.

Let us also keep an eye on those who have cool drinks  mixed  with  alcohol.
There need to be humps where  adventurers  do  drag  racing  in  residential
areas so that more of this speeding can  be  avoided.  We  must  also  avoid
bribery. Corruption  has  been  the  issue  that  has  destroyed  everything
everywhere. We must be so morally strong that we do not  get  bribed  easily
by money, drinks, sex or personal or selfish ambitions. It does  not  matter
what education or wealth you have, because  even  if  you  are  an  academic
giant, if you are morally weak you become a dwarf. May we help ourselves  to
avoid these accidents and similar  ones.  I  urge  that  we  publicise  this
Arrive Alive number, which is: 0861 400 800. I will say it  again:  0861 400
800. So, Arrive Alive throughout December and January, and for the  rest  of
our lives.

The Select Committee on Public Services  of  this  Parliament  endorses  the
Arrive  Alive  programme.  The  number  again:  0861 400 800.  More   police
recruits are not the answer. All of us use the road and use vehicles  so  we
are all responsible. Let old and young decide  to  do  something  right  now
about Arrive Alive to reduce this loss of life.

This is a season of joy, happiness, reunions and forgiveness. The  scripture
says: ``Glory be to God on high and on earth peace and goodwill towards  all
people.'' I urge you to follow this upside down, which  means  that,  if  we
are willing to be good to all people, there will  be  peace  on  earth,  and
with peace on earth, there will be glory to God on  high.  Again,  I  plead:
Arrive alive. The number is: 0861 400 800.

We support Arrive Alive. [Applause.]

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES
THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES: Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson. In saying farewell to the members at the end of this very  busy
year, we would have to start with the leadership  you  have  displayed,  the
guidance that  you  have  given  to  this  particular  Council,  your  quiet
authority and your guidance at all critical times. I think  I  could  say  I
speak on behalf of all the members when we  acknowledge  and  recognise  the
role that you have played in leading this House.  We  also  acknowledge  the
support that you have received from  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  who  is  not
present here, and congratulate him in his absence on his appointment to  the
Pan-African Parliament.

This is a quite unique House and I think we are all leaders here and  almost
members of a family and it is quite inspiring and motivating to  be  working
in a House like this where you have the tremendous support and  co-operation
from  all  members,  from  different  provinces  from  different   political
parties;  and  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  support,   the   mutual
understanding, the tolerance and the cameraderie that  have  been  displayed
here throughout the year. So I say, from the ANC, thank you to  the  members
from all the other political parties as well as the members of  the  African
National Congress. As the Chief Whip, thank you  to  the  Whippery,  to  the
chairpersons of committees for their leadership,  the  chairpersons  of  the
various committees for their role that they played in guiding  this  Council
through its difficult period.  I  know  the  programme  has  been  extremely
demanding this year, but we have been able to accomplish much  in  terms  of
oversight, taking Parliament to the people,  provincial  weeks,  legislative
scrutiny, the wonderful  amendments  that  have  been  brought  through  the
various committees. In fact, more than 80% of the Bills  that  have  reached
us have been amended; so committees have been hard at work. May you  have  a
restful festive season. We thank you for that.

But before we conclude, I think we have  to  acknowledge  the  role  of  the
Secretary of the NCOP, the heads of committees and the  various  members  of
the  committee  section,  the  Table  staff,  the  service   officers,   the
interpreters, working very hard, the members of staff of the  NCOP,  Hansard
and all and sundry who are attached to this institution for  their  support.
We also extend our best wishes to them during the festive  season  and  also
thank them for the unstinting support they have given to the institution.

With these words I say, arrive alive and being as  considerate  as  you  are
when you drive, you will have due regard for the safety of other  motorists,
the passengers in your vehicle as well as pedestrians. May God be with  you!
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, by my reckoning, this is the  fifth  end  of  the
year in which we take leave of each other, and it signals also that some  of
us perhaps in the democratic process will not be coming back, some of us  by
choice and others perhaps not so, but whatever the situation is,  on  behalf
of myself and my colleagues in the DA, we wish everyone the  best  over  the
festive season. We hope they have fulfilled  their  personal  goals  and  we
also express our gratitude to all our colleagues from all  parties  in  this
House for the general goodwill we have experienced over these  five  end-of-
year seasons and also in our work in this Council,  and  I  simply  wish  to
express the good wishes of myself and my colleagues  to  everybody.  Have  a
good New Year and festive season and come  back  safely,  if  that  is  your
fate. [Applause.]

Mr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  want  to  share  something  with  my
colleagues and that is about a woman who smiled  at  a  sorrowful  stranger.
The smile seemed to make him feel a little bit better.  He  remembered  past
kindnesses of a friend and wrote him a thank you letter. The friend  was  so
pleased with the thank you letter that he left a large tip after lunch.  The
waitress, surprised by the size of the tip, bet the whole thing on a  hunch.
The next day, she picked up her winnings, and gave part  to  a  man  on  the
street. The man on the street was grateful; for two days he had had  nothing
to eat. After he had finished his dinner,  he  left  for  his  small,  dingy
room. He did not know at that moment that he might be facing  his  doom.  On
the way, he picked up a shivering puppy and took him home to get  warm.  The
puppy was very grateful to be in out of the storm.  That  night,  the  house
caught on fire. The puppy barked the alarm.  He  barked  till  he  woke  the
whole household and saved everybody from harm.  One  of  the  boys  that  he
rescued grew up to be president. All this because of  a  simple  smile  that
had not cost a single cent.

Chairperson, on behalf of the New NP, I want to thank  you  and  the  deputy
presiding  officers  for  your  smiles,  the  secretariat  for  theirs,  the
supporting staff, Hansard and the media, but especially five people that  we
so often take for granted in this House. I want to call out their names.  On
behalf of the New NP, I have a gesture of thanks for  each  of  them.  These
people are Dorothy Kovo, Brent Leeuwendal, Moira Foster,  Zuko  Bokwana  and
Freek Erasmus. I am sure many of the members sitting here do not  even  know
who they are. They are our service officers here and, on behalf  of  myself,
I want to thank you specially and I want to give you your envelopes when  we
go out. To all my colleagues, the Christian colleagues, I hope  you  have  a
Christian-filled season and to all the other colleagues,  I  hope  you  will
also enjoy the peace of this festive season. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, at last we have come to the  end  of  our  five-
year parliamentary term, and to epitomise this lengthy period  of  hard  and
difficult work in the NCOP, perhaps  Shakespeare  would  have  put  it  into
these words: ``Let's call the field to rest and part  the  glories  of  this
happy day.'' And myself and Mom Vilakazi wish to say that we have been  very
happy in the NCOP and we have been very happy in every sense of the word.

We meet to part and part to meet and as I stand here, I would not  say  that
I will come back to the NCOP nor that I will come back in the  NA,  but  you
see, as we all know, politics being what it is, I will never  know  where  I
will end up. Perhaps I will end up in my province. But having said  that,  I
wish to commend, Madam Chair, your sterling leadership, which has been  very
unprecedented, particularly the way you steered the NCOP as an  institution.
Your leadership qualities are indeed living proof that not only the  sterner
sex,  but  also  the  fairer  sex  can  actually  display  those  leadership
qualities. I have been very impressed by your global vision  which  has  not
been blurred by party politics. Most of us actually succumb to that kind  of
a thing.

I will miss the wonderful co-operation from my Chief Whip, Mr  Surty.  Allow
me to thank my colleague, Sis Joyce. I usually call her Sis  Joyce.  I  will
not forget the way she addresses me. She will always  say  ``Ngcolisi''.  As
an African that actually touches the very ... [Interjections.] I  wish  also
to thank all the political parties in the NCOP, including provincial  Whips.
I also wish to thank all the  staff  who  have  been  very  kind  to  us  in
executing our job. With those few words, I think  that  members  will  agree
with me that we have tried, in this NCOP, to make it a family  and  I  think
that that spirit will continue even  if  we  are  not  here.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Thank you, Chair. We have once  more  come  to  the  end  of
another year and, of course, it's not far from the end of the term,  but  we
need to acknowledge that we managed to serve in this Parliament up  to  this
time not due to our own making, but rather due to the mercy of our Creator.

The UDM regrets the passing away  of  some  of  our  colleagues  during  the
course of this year and term as well.  We  salute  them  because  they  died
while engaged in the struggle for transformation and reconstruction  of  our
country, ravaged by the past apartheid regime.

We recognise and acknowledge the outstanding  leadership  qualities  of  our
Chairperson, the hon member, Grace Naledi Pandor.  She  is  indeed  a  star,
hence the word ``Naledi''. Let's not forget the Deputy Chair, hon  member  J
M Mahlangu. He has been, to me,  very  accommodating  and  approachable  and
always sober-minded.

Our Chief Whip, Enver Surty, has  more  often  reflected  Christian  virtues
than those of a prefect  or  a  Whip.  He  has  been  accommodating  in  our
multiparty Whips' forum. We  never  experienced  deadlocks  because  of  his
leadership skills. Chairpersons of Committees,  you  have  been  considerate
indeed and have managed your committees skilfully  and  successfully.  Chair
of Chairs, Sis Joyce, you have always displayed a high degree of  dedication
and commitment to your work. As for me and  as  for  apparently  this  House
here, we are going to miss the laughter that was in this House, sounds  like
``Order! Order!'', sounds  like  ``Goikolê!  Goikolê''  ...  [Laughter]  ...
sounds like ``Ke ya rona! Ke ya rona!'' [We support.] [Laughter.]

In conclusion, I wish everybody a  happy  Christmas  and  a  prosperous  New
Year. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson and  the  honourable
House. Saying goodbye to people whom one has befriended closely  is  not  an
easy task. It touches the  inner  feelings  of  those  that  are  being  bid
goodbye, as well as the one that bids them goodbye. As  I  bid  you  goodbye
this afternoon, I feel within my heart the temporary  cutting  off  of  that
chord that always bound us together irrespective of our different  political
affiliations. The Chairperson,  a  very  strict  but  likable  lady  with  a
pleasant disposition, has been our mother and guide since we  came  to  this
House. I wish her a pleasant festive season and a prosperous New  Year.  The
Deputy Chairperson and the Chief Whip, a very humble and accommodating  man,
have  been  our  help  and  support  in  problematic  times.  I  take   this
opportunity to wish them, together with all my comrades  and  colleagues  in
this House a pleasant festive season and a prosperous New Year.

Mr K D S DURR: Thank you very much. I  ask  myself,  when  I  reflect  back,
Chairperson, over the past twelve months, a few simple  questions  and  that
is: Have we made a difference? I think we have. Have we  made  good  law?  I
think we have. Have we improved legislation that has been  sent  to  us?  We
have, on a very large scale. [Applause.] Have we enriched  our  society?  We
have. Have we broken new ground? We have. Have we done our  duty?  We  have.
Have we been self-critical? If you listen to our Chairperson when she  spoke
in the President's debate, when,  positive  though  she  is  and  supportive
though she is of this institution, she  remained  self-critical  and  looked
for ways and means, as we constantly must, to improve  the  situation  here.
So with all of that, I have to say my cup runneth over and I think  that  we
have done our duty, and that is always good.

I greet my colleagues here. Thank you, Chairperson, your deputy,  the  Chief
Whip, and all of my colleagues. They are wonderful. Also in the  opposition,
you know the small party I  have,  I  have  always  been  encouraged  by  my
colleagues on the ANC side. I would not tell  you  how  and  why,  but  they
have; and they have enriched my life and I thank them for that.

I would then greet everybody rather in my farewell speech not in  the  sense
of goodbye, but in the sense of au revoir. I thank you. [Applause.]

THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, hon members. Now, I  must  first  of
all remind hon members that unless they know something that I do  not  know,
the term has not ended. You are merely saying au revoir  until  26  January,
or 26 January, 2004. You will then be back. Following that, we do not  know,
but we have another term which we must complete and work in.

I note hon members, and this is not at all a  political  comment,  that  the
two clocks in our chamber indicate different times. The clock  to  my  right
is behind time and the clock to my left is absolutely  accurate.  I  am  not
quite sure  politically  what  that  means.  [Laughter.]  I  must,  however,
proceed to thank all hon members for the contributions  they  have  made  to
the House in this year. And I must, having said that,  congratulate  you  on
your sterling, hard work. I believe members have been quite  amazing.  I  am
most impressed. I thank you heartily for  your  dedication.  I  believe  you
have been working extremely hard and you are deserving of the rest  you  are
about to proceed to.

To all members I say  therefore,  your  work  in  the  National  Council  of
Provinces has been extremely well done. I wish you well during  the  festive
season.

I congratulate the Deputy  Chairperson  on  having  joined  this  House  and
having taken so well to the work of the National  Council  of  Provinces.  I
also congratulate him on his elevation to being our representative  of  this
Parliament, one of five, who will serve us in the Pan-African Parliament.

I also would like to express particular thanks  to  the  presiding  officers
who assist us - the Chairperson of Committees, Mrs Kgoali,  and  the  Deputy
Chairperson of Committees, Mr Bhengu. I also must thank the chairpersons  of
our select committees.

BoKgosi Mokoena le ba bangwe, le dira tiro e kgolo. Re  a  le  leboga.  [The
Kgoshi Mokoenas and the others, you are doing a great job.  We  thank  you.]
You certainly give us status through the excellent way  in  which  you  lead
our committees. And, of course,  the  members  play  an  important  role  in
ensuring that our committees do work.

I must then proceed to thank the Chief Whip of the National Council for  his
consistent, hard work and dedication to this House.  I  had  been  observing
his hair for some time and I wondered whether it would be all white  by  the
end of the year, but because we still have a term to  go,  perhaps  we  will
see at the end of that next  term  whether  the  all-white  will  come,  but
certainly the hard work points to a need for more white hairs,  because  you
are certainly one of the hardest-working people that I have ever met.

I also thank all  the  provincial  Whips  and  the  party  Whips  for  their
leadership roles and their contributions  within  the  National  Council  of
Provinces. I congratulated them particularly for having learned in the  last
six months to be early for the programme committee meetings. This is  indeed
a huge success for the National Council of Provinces.

I would like,  hon  members,  on  your  behalf,  to  proceed  to  thank  the
Secretary to Parliament, the Deputy Secretary, the Assistant Secretary,  all
the divisional managers as well as all the general staff for  the  excellent
work and role they play in this institution in providing it with  management
support and in ensuring that our systems begin to work toward a point  where
they will efficiently service parliamentarians and the public at large.

We have noted a number of achievements. We have begun to  craft  a  language
policy, which I believe will begin  to  serve  our  Parliament  well  as  we
develop it into a practical policy. I also would like to thank the  language
staff, because we tend, in this House, to use language rather often  and  we
have been well-served through good interpretation services and we thank  our
language and Hansard staff for that role.

I would also like to congratulate the staff and the Secretary in  particular
for having ensured that we have an  information  technology  support  centre
available to members, for having given support to our committees  to  ensure
that they do work well.

Having thanked the Secretary to Parliament, I am sure you would not deny  me
the right to thank the Secretary to the National  Council  of  Provinces  in
particular and her staff for their dedication to  the  House  and  the  very
hard work that they have done on our behalf.

Hon  members,  working  in  the  National  Council  of  Provinces   requires
dexterity, decisiveness, flexibility  and  a  well-rounded  competence,  and
each one of you has these qualities. We also  express  appreciation  to  our
provincial representatives and leadership, the  Premiers,  the  Speakers  of
the provincial legislatures, and members in the provincial legislatures  who
work so well with us. We thank local government through Salga as well.

We must also acknowledge the liaison officers and, of  course,  our  service
officers. I am curious, you all have to bring the  envelopes  to  my  office
and I will decide whether you keep  them!  [Laughter.]  But,  certainly,  we
thank our service officers for always being so ready to be of assistance  to
us in this House. I observe them from this Chair and thus far,  I  have  not
seen a single one of them taking a peek at the many  notes  that  we  write.
They have a very well-developed sense of confidentiality, and I admire  them
for that and thank them for that honesty. Each one  of  you  and  the  staff
play vital roles  in  ensuring  the  progress  of  our  democracy.  You  are
necessary to our continued progress.

I hope that hon members will strive hard to ensure  that  they  continue  to
play a role in the life of our country and that the process  of  determining
candidates for 2004 will not see our members holding back in  ensuring  that
indeed they continue to play some form of a life in  the  democracy  and  in
our Parliament.

I conclude by asking you to ensure that you arrive alive. The way to  do  it
is to limit that liquid that Mr Raju referred to. Alcohol is the  blight  of
our nation. It is destructive, and we cannot drink and  drive.  I  wish  you
all a very happy festive season, a merry Christmas, a  happy  2004,  a  good
election campaign, safety and the return on 26 January at 8:30  am  for  the
first committee meeting and then the programme committee  thereafter.  Thank
you very much, hon members. My thanks to you all. Happy holidays.

The Council adjourned at 18.44.
