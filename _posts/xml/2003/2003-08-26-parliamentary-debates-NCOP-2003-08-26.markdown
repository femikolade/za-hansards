                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
you are all most welcome back  from  your  recess.  I  know  you  have  been
attending your committees. This is our first sitting today. Thank  you  very
much, and you are all welcome.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the  next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the blatant  lies  which  the  DA  is  using  in  their
       campaign in the municipal by-election in  Pietermaritzburg  in  their
       attempts to mislead the voters by -


       (a)  suggesting on their posters and in  their  propaganda  pamphlets
           that a vote for the DA will ``Keep the ANC  Out'',  whilst  full
           well knowing that -


           (i)   this is impossible in that the ANC already has an absolute
                 majority  of  43  councillors  out  of  the  total  of   73
                 councillors on the Pietermaritzburg Msinduzi  council,  and
                 that the results of the coming by-election will in  no  way
                 change this absolute majority of the ANC; and


           (ii)  the DA does not at present have, nor after the by-election
                 will have, any influence whatsoever on any decisions of the
                 Pietermaritzburg  Msinduzi  Council,  irrespective  of  the
                 outcome of the by-election;


       (b)  stating that ``the  ANC  now  wants  to  decide  for  you  which
           religious faith should be practised during school hours''; and


       (c)  saying ``Don't let the ANC decide how your religious rights must
           be exercised''; and


  (2) expresses its disgust at the lack of integrity  and  honesty  in  the
       propaganda  of  the  DA  and  requests  the   Independent   Electoral
       Commission to institute measures to prevent this  kind  of  political
       fraud against the voters before the general election next year.

[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of the Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the blatant  lies  which  the  DA  is  using  in  their
       campaign in the municipal by-election in  Pietermaritzburg  in  their
       attempts to mislead the voters by stating  in  their  pamphlets  that
       they ``will put 150 000 cops on the streets'' whilst they  know  full
       well that they cannot even put one policeman on the street; and


  (2) expresses its disgust at the lack of integrity  and  honesty  in  the
       propaganda  of  the  DA  and  requests  the   Independent   Electoral
       Commission to institute measures to prevent this  kind  of  political
       fraud against the voters before the general election next year.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  met  die
volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem -


  (1) van die blatante leuens wat die DA in hul munisipale tussenverkiesing
       in Pietermaritzburg gebruik wanneer hulle sê  slegs  die  DA,  as  'n
       sterk opposisie, staan  tussen  die  ANC  en  'n  eenpartystaat  soos
       Zimbabwe;


  (2) dat die stelling onwaar is, want Zimbabwe het die sterkste  opposisie
       in die hele Afrika; en


  (3) dat al  wat  tussen  Suid-Afrika  en  Zimbabwe  staan  die  gematigde
       leierskap van die ANC is, wat ondersteun moet word deur  inspraak  en
       die behoud van eie identiteit.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I shall move at the next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the Council notes -


  (1) the blatant lies used by the DA in  their  municipal  by-election  in
       Pietermaritzburg when  they  say  that  only  the  DA,  as  a  strong
       opposition, stands  between  the  ANC  and  a  one-party  state  like
       Zimbabwe;


  (2) that the statement is untrue,  because  Zimbabwe  has  the  strongest
       opposition in the whole of Africa; and


  (3) that only the leadership of the ANC, supported by  participation  and
       retention of  an  own  identity,  stands  between  South  Africa  and
       Zimbabwe.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Chairperson, I give notice that at  the  next  meeting  of
the Council, I am going to move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)   the  provincial  auditor-general's  remarks,  highlighting  the
           remarkable improvement of performance by provincial  departments
           in terms of the Public Finance Management Act in repect  of  the
           past three years; and


       (b)  that the  provincial  auditor-general  reported  that  only  one
           department out of twelve got a qualified audit opinion; and


  (2)  congratulates  the  provincial  government  of  Mpumalanga  on  this
       splendid performance and urges it to improve further, bearing in mind
       that the province in the  not-so-distant  past  was  subjected  to  a
       section 100 intervention.
              AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION OF VOTERS IN SOUTH AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) with a view to the coming  and  subsequent  democratic  elections  in
       South Africa, calls upon the Government generally and the  Department
       of Home  Affairs  in  particular  to  work  towards  encouraging  the
       automatic registration of voters  by  local  authorities  and  public
       bodies  whenever  voters  apply  for  municipal  services   such   as
       electricity and water, or pay rates;


  (2) is of the view that -


       (a)  the particular service should only be provided  if  the  records
           show that the applicant is registered as a voter at the address;
       (b)  if the applicant is not registered, he  or  she  should  sign  a
           voter registration form before the service is provided to ensure
           the registration of an  applicant  as  well  as  that  of  other
           related occupants at the same address;


       (c)  political parties would be free to  continue  with  registration
           support to voters; and


       (d)  the same principle can be applied when TV licences or  telephone
           services are applied for; and


  (3) acknowledges that the above procedures of automatic registration  are
       the norm in many democratic countries and ensure  a  high  degree  of
       voter registration and thus participation at election time, and  will
       save the country and political parties a  huge  amount  of  time  and
       money.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       hoofstroompolitiek   'n    werklikheid    te    maak    en    daarmee
       isolasiepolitiek, soos bedryf op die Westminster-styl, 'n nekslag toe
       te dien; en


  (3) hom sterkte en sukses toewens, en die Vrystaatse  Wetgewer  gelukwens
       met die begin van die implementering van die ooreenkoms.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)
[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Mr Inus Aucamp, leader of the New NP in  the  Free  State,
       has been appointed as Deputy Speaker in the Free State Legislature;


  (2) is of the  opinion  that  this  appointment  confirms  the  agreement
       between the ANC and the New NP  to  make  participation  by  minority
       groups in mainstream politics a reality, thereby dealing a  finishing
       blow to isolation politics based on the Westminster style; and


  (3) wishes him well and all the best in his new post, and wishes the Free
       State Legislature success with the implementation of the agreement.]

                     NATURAL SCIENTIFIC PROFESSIONS BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:  Thank  you,  Sir.  I
take it I can speak from here, or is there a podium?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Unfortunately,
Minister, we do not have a podium here. You can speak from your seat.

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  They  are  lovely
seats, Sir. Congratulations to the NCOP for the beautiful arrangement.

Deputy Chairperson,  hon  colleagues  and  my  colleague  Mrs  Sonjica,  the
Natural Scientific Professions Bill which we are proposing for  adoption  by
the  NCOP  represents  an  important  milestone  in  the  reorganisation  of
governance in the science and technology system  following  the  achievement
of democracy in 1994.

It has been given careful consideration by the Portfolio Committee on  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology. We have  contributed  thoughtful  proposals
to strengthen the Bill and to ensure that the objectives of  this  piece  of
legislation can be fully met. I would like to thank the  committee  for  the
diligent way in which they went about this work and for the product that  is
before you today. I would  also  like  to  thank  the  Select  Committee  on
Education and Recreation of the NCOP for their inputs in the Bill.

Scientific professions represent a critical element of the workforce  within
a knowledge economy. As the impact of  science  and  technology  on  society
increases, there is a need to provide an  effective  process  of  monitoring
and registering certain categories of practitioners, so that their  economic
activities can be undertaken in a fully professional  manner.  In  addition,
there is a broader need to provide scientists  with  an  opportunity  to  be
registered and therefore be available to  the  South  African  community  to
assist in, for instance,  the  setting  of  standards  for  the  quality  of
training that is provided within the public  education  system.  This  is  a
positive  role  already  undertaken   on   a   voluntary   basis   by   many
professionals.

The current Natural Scientific Professions Act  suffers  from  a  number  of
deficiencies in respect of the governance of  the  SA  Council  for  Natural
Scientific Professions in the context of the new South Africa.  The  process
of appointing the council tended to be bottom-up and potentially  uncreative
in  respect  of  transformation  and  representivity.  The  new   mechanisms
established in the Bill which is before you deal with this matter in  a  far
more open, inclusive and transparent process.  This  can  only  enhance  the
status of the council and allow it to play its full role in the  context  of
the new South Africa.

Examples of disciplines where the registration  of  natural  scientists  has
proven its  worth  include  the  area  of  the  geological  sciences,  where
consultants and practitioners  undertake  work  that  can  have  significant
economic impact. With  the  changes  relating  to  mineral  rights  and  the
associated requirement for Government to play a more  active  role  in  this
area, the consequences of a lack of professionalism or  suitable  competence
relating to  economic  geology  could  be  detrimental  to  the  process  of
transformation.

The new legislation provides a far more flexible  framework  for  definition
of disciplines and will therefore be  much  more  efficiently  administered.
Good governance and effective administration are key principles to which  we
must adhere. The Bill before you is fully within the spirit  of  Batho  Pele
and represents a considerable  improvement  on  the  current  situation.  It
embodies the important principle that natural scientists are expected to  be
professional and accountable in  how  they  use  their  knowledge,  and  the
impact this  has  on  the  economic  performance  of  our  country  and  the
livelihood of our people.  I  urge  you,  therefore,  to  adopt  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  Deputy  Minister,
before I say something, let me just  touch  on  the  report  of  the  Select
Committee on Education and Recreation on the Natural Scientific  Professions
Bill (B 56B-2002). The Select Committee on Education and  Recreation  having
considered the subject of  the  Bill,  reports  the  Bill  with  a  proposed
amendment as follows: clause 53, on page 16 in line 15, after ``the  state''
to insert, ``except in  so  far  as  the  state  provides  for  its  science
services''.

One of the indicators of the  degree  of  sophistication  of  our  country's
science system is the range of  science  and  technology  institutions  that
exists, and also the extent to which those institutions are governed.

The Bill before us today introduces a direction that not only addresses  our
shortcomings, but in addition seeks to see  us  function  in  a  transparent
fashion. National bodies  covered  by  this  Bill  include  a  comprehensive
range, such as the Medical Research Council, the  Council  for  Science  and
Industrial Research and others. These bodies  can,  however,  only  function
optimally if their representivity is  governed  and  managed,  meaning  that
they are composed of and represent the different categories of  the  natural
scientific professions and the diverse people of this country.

As we know, the outgoing SA Council for Natural Scientific  Professions  has
been in existence for a number of years  and  it  is  therefore  appropriate
that we pay tribute to these dedicated people. We admire  their  dedication,
vision and perseverance. We can  today  all  be  proud  that  through  their
efforts we are well on our way to further transforming this establishment.

Our ANC-led Government is keenly aware of the scientific  and  technological
challenges facing our country, and it is certain that we will  find  the  SA
National Council for Natural Scientific  Professions  a  valuable  ally.  We
expect that Government will consult  with  it,  request  it  to  investigate
science policy options and  constructively  use  the  information  emanating
from this body. Moreover, students  of  science  today  generally  recognise
that one of the critical success factors  for  science  is  crosspollination
between the different fields of science. This body  certainly  provides  the
platform for budding and emerging  young  scientists  to  network  and  thus
exchange  views  and  ideas,  and  to  create  interest  in  the   sciences,
especially among young black South Africans.

As pointed out by both the hon the Minister and  the  Deputy,  it  is  clear
that  the  principal  Act  has  become  outdated  and  did  not   meet   the
transformation  demands  of  our  democratic  South  Africa.   The   Natural
Scientific Professions Bill will  go  a  long  way  towards  addressing  the
developments  in  higher  education  in  terms  of  the  SA   Qualifications
Authority and the challenges of Nepad, and also speaks to our  own  domestic
backlogs.

As the ANC we are of one mind that it is in line  with  our  human  resource
development strategy. Having said that, it goes without saying that  only  a
small fraction of our population is in fact scientifically literate. We  are
confident that  through  this  council  understanding  of  science  will  be
increased across the length and breadth of South Africa.

The Bill has been subjected  to  rigorous  scrutiny  by  the  committee.  In
addition, we  know  that  the  department  consulted  widely  and  with  all
accredited national scientific institutions and bodies. We believe that  the
foundation has been laid for the new council to take off. It  could  reflect
how much has  been  achieved  in  the  past  ten  years  and  focus  on  the
challenges ahead  of  it.  We  know  that  in  science  every  day  requires
innovation and presents new challenges.

In  conclusion,  we  trust   that   this   will   reposition   our   country
scientifically in the global arena,  and  produce  relevant,  important  and
fascinating sources of information for the young here and on  the  continent
because the undesirable impact of apartheid  and  colonialism  has  left  an
indelible mark. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER:  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Minister,  colleagues,  this  is  not  a
contentious Bill. The DA, in substance, supports this Bill. I  do,  however,
wish to highlight some of the issues that were highlighted by  my  party  in
the National Assembly.
Firstly, it is our hope that in its application this Bill  will  not  become
overbureacratic. Secondly, there is a  concern  relating  to  clause  16(3),
which compels the council to provide  information  at  the  request  of  the
director-general. It is our view  that,  in  some  circumstances,  this  may
infringe on the individual's right  to  privacy.  But  despite  these  minor
concerns, the Democratic Alliance supports this Bill. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I see the  hon  Deputy
Minister of Arts, Science and Technology. Congratulations on behalf  of  the
Council on being appointed Deputy Minister. I know you as  my  close  friend
and a hard-working woman and I'm very sure that you'll  be  very  useful  in
that department in assisting the Minister in his work. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Thank  you
very much, Chairperson, for your kind words. Probably I  need  to  start  by
expressing appreciation  to  the  Chief  Whip  of  the  majority  party  for
affording me the opportunity to address this House for the very  first  time
in my life. Probably if I'd missed this opportunity I wouldn't  be  able  to
come back and address you again because I may  be  redeployed  -  you  never
know. [Laughter.]

Chairperson, Minister Ngubane, members of  the  Council  and  colleagues,  I
agree with  the  Minister  this  afternoon  that  we  have  reached  another
milestone in transforming our legislative framework in the area  of  science
and technology. What is encouraging is that we all seem to agree that as  we
implement the laws and policies, we  have  to  evaluate  if  such  laws  are
implementable and respond to the broad objective of  improving  the  quality
of life of our people.

At this stage I would like to thank the outgoing  council,  the  SA  Council
for Natural Scientific Professions, for being co-operative  in  the  process
of not only amending but replacing the principal Act of 1993  through  which
it was established, and for  acknowledging,  in  their  submissions  to  the
portfolio  committee  in  the  National  Assembly,   that   this   Act   has
limitations.

This is a  demonstration  of  commitment  to  the  imperatives  of  the  new
dispensation, and this communicates a message  which  says  that  scientists
are also agents of change.

It is for obvious reasons that this Bill does not  amend  but  replaces  the
original Act  of  1993.  The  Bill  before  us  today  reflects  the  policy
framework that we ushered in through the election of  our  first  democratic
Government in  1994,  whose  core  elements  includes  transparency,  public
participation, accountability, an integrated approach to governance  and  so
on.

The composition of the new council is expected to reflect  the  demographics
of our country. This means a very diverse  membership  along  the  lines  of
race, gender and age. What  is  even  more  unique  is  the  provision  that
requires representation from  the  public.  A  more  transparent  nomination
process that involves public participation in clause 4(1)  of  the  Bill  is
but another vehicle for making science accessible to the ordinary people  of
South Africa.

This new council will be a symbol of democracy because not only people  with
academic  qualifications  will  participate,  but  it  will  recognise   the
contribution that ordinary people who are the consumers of science can  make
in this area. We hope that through the process of public  participation  and
transparent nomination, we will be  able  to  identify  people  who  have  a
wealth of experience from working not only as laboratory assistants  but  as
ordinary workers.

We are all aware of a gentleman by the name of Hamilton Naki, who  was  born
at kwaNgcingane in the Eastern Cape and came to Cape Town at the age of  18.
He found a job as a gardener at the University of Cape Town and ended up  as
a laboratory assistant for an organ  transplant.  In  June  this  year,  the
University of Cape Town awarded him an honorary degree of Master of  Science
in Medicine.

The ideas of this ordinary South African gave  rise  to  the  world-renowned
first heart transplant that was performed by the late Dr Christiaan  Barnard
on 2 December 1967. In his own words, Dr  Christiaan  Barnard  acknowledged,
and I quote:


  Hamilton Naki was technically better than I was on heart transplant.

Mr Hamilton Naki, we  are  told,  was  one  of  the  few  people  who  could
anaesthetise  a  pig  and  transplant  its  liver  virtually   without   any
assistance, and I want to add that he is probably the only  person  who  was
able to do this without any technical and scientific training.

As we implement our laws and policies, another weakness that we identify  is
a lack of co-ordination at the level of service  delivery,  both  vertically
and horizontally at different levels of government. As  Government  we  need
to take the policy of co-operative governance as an urgent challenge  as  we
enter the second decade of democracy. However,  we  are  greatly  encouraged
that this Bill provides for the new council to  co-ordinate  its  activities
with the relevant bodies, such as the SA Qualifications  Authority  and  the
Council on Higher Education.

It is also reassuring  to  see  statutory  bodies  being  conscious  of  the
concept of co-operative governance, as provided for  in  Chapter  3  of  our
Constitution.  Co-ordination  and  co-operative  governance  facilitate  the
efficient utilisation of resources  for  the  benefit  of  our  diverse  and
competing developmental needs.

In South Africa we  have  adopted  the  principle  of  accountability  as  a
measure of good governance. We can only emphasise the provisions  of  clause
15, which requires that the council should provide accountability  in  terms
of the Public Finance Management Act. The Bill gives the council  discretion
to establish and administer a fund for the  purpose  of  the  education  and
training  of  students  in  natural  scientific  professions  and  for   the
continued education and training of registered persons  in  compliance  with
the national development imperatives.

Although clause 15(5) of the  Bill  does  not  prescribe  that  the  council
should establish this fund, as Government we would  strongly  encourage  its
establishment, because as a country we have identified  a  serious  lack  of
expertise and capacity in the field of science.  Recent  surveys  inform  us
that our scientific community is mainly white, male  and  ageing.  Therefore
this council, like other similar bodies, has a challenging task to grow  the
numbers, especially from the previously disadvantaged communities  and  with
particular attention given to women and girls.

The amendment that has been effected by the NCOP in clause 43  of  the  Bill
excludes the state's natural scientists in the area  of  forensic  services.
This we welcome, given the challenges we are faced with in this  area  as  a
country.

In conclusion I would like to thank Parliament, both  the  select  committee
and  the  portfolio  committee,  for  their  careful  consideration  of  and
deliberation on the Bill. I would also like to thank the  officials  of  our
Department of Science and Technology for their tireless  efforts  in  making
sure that all inputs from Parliament and the public at large  are  reflected
in the final draft Bill.

I want to further encourage the strong team spirit that was demonstrated  by
these officials during the processing of this Bill, and I particularly  want
to thank Ms Anusha Lucen for her ever ready response  to  any  queries  that
needed attention.

Last but not least, and very importantly, I want to  thank  and  acknowledge
my Minister, and my predecessor, Minister  of  Housing,  Mrs  Mabandla,  for
their outstanding role in transforming the area of science  and  technology.
I therefore join the Minister in urging you to adopt this Bill as amended.

I thank you and I hope you understood why I took so long, since this was  my
maiden speech  and  I  had  to  allow  you  to  listen  to  me  for  longer.
[Laughter.] Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you,  Deputy
Minister. You have not been controversial in your maiden  speech,  otherwise
there would have been a point of order. Thank you very much, you did well.

Mnr F ADAMS: Mnr die Adjunkvoorsitter, Minister, Adjunkminister en lede  van
die Huis, laat  my  toe  om  die  Adjunkminister  geluk  te  wens  met  haar
nuwelingstoespraak in die  Huis,  en  ek  hoop  daar  sal  vele  sulke  mooi
toesprake wees van so 'n mooi dame! [Tussenwerpsels.] Veels geluk!

Met die hantering van hierdie wetsontwerp  het  die  Departement  van  Kuns,
Kultuur, Wetenskap en Tegnologie sy funksionering verbeter. Daarvoor wil  ek
erkenning gee aan die  Minister  en  sy  departement,  die  voorsitter,  mnr
Kgware, en lede van ons komitee, wat begin het om stelsels  en  gebruike  in
te stel wat lank reeds in  sommige  ander  lande  gevestig  is.  Dit  is  'n
geskiedkundige tyd vir Suid-Afrika en ek is  bly  om  as  'n  Suid-Afrikaner
deel te wees van hierdie geskiedenis. Die Nuwe  NP  steun  die  wetsontwerp.
Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Mr Deputy Chairperson, Minister, Deputy  Minister  and  members
of the House, allow me to congratulate the Deputy  Minister  on  her  maiden
speech in the House, and I hope that  there  will  be  many  such  beautiful
speeches from such a beautiful lady! [Interjections.] Congratulations!

In dealing with this Bill, the Department  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology has improved its functioning. For this I want to acknowledge  the
Minister and his department, the chairperson, Mr Kgware, and members of  our
committee,  who  began  implementing  systems  and   practices   that   were
established in other countries long ago. It is a historical time  for  South
Africa and as a South African I am pleased to be part of this  history.  The
New NP supports the Bill. Thank you.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister
and hon members, as the ANC we are indeed pleased  to  have  this  important
Bill before this House today. We are pleased because it emerged as a  result
of Government's and the department's concerns regarding the  limitations  of
the Natural Scientific Professions Act of 1993.

As in the case of all legislation passed  by  the  ANC-led  Government,  the
review of the principal Act was comprehensive and detailed. To  the  ANC  it
highlighted practices within  the  system  that  were  not  geared  to  good
governance, transparency and flexibility.

To address these goals, this Bill seeks to provide for the establishment  of
the South African Council for Natural Scientific  Professions  and  for  the
registration   of   professional   candidates   and   certificated   natural
scientists.  Accordingly,  it  ensures  that  members  of  the  council  are
nominated through an open process of public participation.

Furthermore, the Bill requires that nominations be presented to an  advisory
panel appointed  by  the  Minister,  thereby  ensuring  the  appointment  of
council members is done in an open and representative fashion. Moreover,  it
will ensure that the council reflects the demographics of our country.

As we are approaching the end of the first decade  of  freedom,  we  cannot,
for the sake of our electorate, allow for things to be  business  as  usual.
The field of science is one of the few areas of serious combat left to us.

Having said this, we must acknowledge the role, expertise and  contributions
made by the previously advantaged in the sphere of science in  our  country.
However, the goal of access to the  field  of  science  needs  to  be  fast-
tracked as a matter of urgency. Cognisant of this objective, as spelled  out
clearly in our human resource development strategy, we in the ANC will  work
together with the Department of Science and Technology to extend  assistance
to this sphere. Moreover, this  will  enable  us  to  effect  the  necessary
changes to ensure that we have the people  with  the  right  skills  in  the
right places.

Many reasons are  put  forward  to  explain  why  unemployment  and  poverty
persist in our society when there is still much to be achieved, and not  all
reasons have to do with the capabilities of people. Many  have  to  do  with
the unequal  distribution  of  scientific  skills  in  our  society.  It  is
therefore critical that we do away with ignorance  amongst  our  schoolgoing
population and remind  them  that  we  were  historically  deprived  of  the
opportunity to study these career paths.

We believe  that  this  Bill  will  ensure  the  sufficient  publication  of
scientific literature, in simple language, of  innovations  and  inventions.
This, we believe, will create a sense of curiosity amongst our young  people
and will  encourage  them  to  emulate  some  of  these  achievements.  Most
importantly, it might just produce the first Einstein from Africa.

With regards to the governance of the council, we  are  assured  of  a  high
level of co-ordination, as the powers of  the  council  are  linked  to  the
provisions of the SA Qualifications Authority and the Higher  Education  Act
of 1997. This is a demonstrated commitment to the principle of  co-operative
governance as enshrined in Chapter 3 of the Constitution.

As the NCOP  we  are  greatly  encouraged  to  see  statutory  bodies  being
conscious of the concept of co-operative governance. Also, we  are  glad  to
highlight the provision that ensures prudent  financial  administration,  as
provided for in clause 15 of the Bill.

The ANC supports the Bill and does so without any hesitation. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY:  Deputy  Chairperson,
thank you to the hon members of the NCOP for their  very  positive  response
and support for this important piece of legislation. I must  also  thank  Mr
Kgware,  the  chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Education   and
Recreation, for the work that they did, in partnership with my colleague  Ms
Sonjica, in finalising and finetuning this Bill to the  stage  where  it  is
now.

South Africa is in its ninth year of freedom and democracy. A  lot  of  work
has been done through the leadership of our Presidents, the Cabinet and  the
parliamentary  system.  We  are  now  at  a  stage  of  fine-tuning  certain
important aspects of legislation, and this is one such aspect.

We are very much aware that any  individual  performing  a  public  function
will be subject to the Access to  Information  Act  and  its  provisions.  I
would therefore like to assure Mr Lever that  there  is  in  any  case  this
Access to Information Act, which prescribes that we who are  in  the  public
domain  make  available  every  aspect  that  is  required  by  the  public,
Parliament and constituents. I do not think  this  represents  a  threat  to
privacy, because if one is in a public role, such as being  a  member  of  a
statutory council for a profession, then one should be  transparent  in  all
actions and aspects of practice.

As we approach the tenth year of democracy  which  we  will  celebrate  next
year, my hope is that the  NCOP  is  going  to  deepen  its  involvement  in
matters  of  science  and  technology,  because  these  are  the  basis  for
innovation. Provinces have to understand that they must harness  information
and communication technologies, as well as all other aspects of science  and
technology endeavour, in order to  better  the  quality  of  life  of  their
people. We should be partners, through the  NCOP,  with  the  provinces.  My
colleague has been visiting the provinces, and she will continue to  do  so.
We would like to have science and technology missions to the provinces.

Thank you for supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.
                  MINING TITLES REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T  S  SETONA:  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  members,  fellow  comrades  and
friends, at  this  hour  of  destiny,  the  focus  month  dedicated  to  the
selfnessness and heroism of our women  in  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs  presents  for
adoption the  Mining  Titles  Registration  Amendment  Bill,  after  careful
consideration.

In dealing with this Bill, the committee did not confer with  provinces,  as
it is a section 75 Bill that  does  not  require  provincial  mandates.  The
select committee  is  however  satisfied  with  the  substantive  levels  of
consultation  with  stakeholders  by  the  department  and   the   Portfolio
Committee  on  Minerals  and  Energy  in  the   National   Assembly.   These
consultations culminated in the broad acceptance of the Bill as  amended  by
all  stakeholders,  including  organised  labour  and   the   major   mining
corporations in this country.
As a testimony to this reality, the managing director of De Beers,  Mr  Gary
Ralf, had this to say, and I quote:


  The company takes comfort from the process of  constructive  consultation
  that has preceded the passing of the  Bill.  We  are  encouraged  by  the
  willingness of the department to engage with the mining industry in  this
  open and transparent manner.

The essence of the Bill is to align the Act with  the  new  mandate  of  the
Minerals and Petroleum Resources Developmnent Act of 2002,  of  placing  the
custodianship of the mineral resources of our country in the  hands  of  the
state. This  breaks  the  monopolistic  patterns  of  ownership  of  mineral
resources by the few historically advantaged sections of our community.

Clause 2 of the Bill establishes  a  central  registration  office  for  all
mining deeds and registration, thus eradicating the duplications created  by
the Minerals Act of 1991, in terms of which the  mining  titles  office  and
the deeds office were responsible for registration. This  is  in  compliance
with the principle of Batho Pele, which is  at  the  heart  of  Government's
agenda for accelerated service delivery.

The Bill also seeks to delete clauses and  definitions  which  are  obsolete
and not in line with the current realities of the South  African  situation.
In the main, the objectives of the Bill are amongst other things:  to  amend
the Mining Titles Registration Act, Act 16 of 1967, with regard  to  certain
definitions; to  re-regulate  the  registration  of  mineral  and  petroleum
titles and other rights connected therewith  and  certain  other  deeds  and
documents; and to effect certain amendments necessary to ensure  consistency
with the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act of 2002.

This amending Bill will for the first time expand the access to  information
in  the  mining  industry,   thus   opening   opportunities   for   enhanced
participation and investment in the industry. The Bill will further  protect
the old order rights and security of tenure in the mining industry.

Whilst there  is  general  consensus  on  the  Bill,  it  is  noteworthy  to
highlight the fact that the issue of succession  of  rights  in  the  mining
industry has been raised from time to  time  at  the  level  of  the  select
committee. The approach of  the  Bill  in  this  regard,  which  the  select
committee concurs with, is the principle of ``use  it  or  lose  it''.  This
approach proceeds from the understanding that it is not  automatic  for  one
to inherit a business in the mining  industry,  unless  that  individual  is
willing to participate  and  is  also  compliant  with  all  other  relevant
requirements. This refers to the whole issue of inheritance.

Since the rights are originally granted by the  state,  they  should  revert
back to the state as the original grantor. This will  enhance  participation
based on the principle of ``willing buyer, willing owner''.

The committee urges this House to pass this amending Bill,  as  amended,  to
further turn the tide against poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
  AFFAIRS - INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF CRIMES
   AGAINST INTERNATIONALLY PROTECTED PERSONS, INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC AGENTS

Mr B J  MKHALIPHI:  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  International  Convention  on
Prevention  and  Punishment  of  Crimes  against  Internationally  Protected
Persons, Including Diplomatic Agents is  a  sequel  to  the  United  Nations
Security Council Resolution passed on  28  September  2001.  The  resolution
called upon all member states,  among  others,  to  become  parties  to  the
relevant international conventions  and  protocols  relating  to  terrorism,
including the International Convention for the Suppression of  Financing  of
Terrorism of 9 December 1999.

In  practical  terms  this  convention  seeks  to  protect   internationally
protected persons - that is yourselves, hon members, when you are  abroad  -
a head of state or government, a minister  of  foreign  affairs  when  in  a
foreign state, an official of a  state  or  an  agent  of  an  international
organisation. The convention stipulates a number of obligations,  conditions
and procedures for the treatment of these internationally protected  persons
in the event of them transgressing the laws of a host state or when  enemies
attack them.

South Africa has committed itself to combating terrorism and the  taking  of
hostages by way of its undertakings in the United Nations,  the  Non-Aligned
Movement and the African Union. We can't pretend not to  know  the  role  of
this country in the African Union. This  therefore  requires  us  to  ratify
this protocol. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! That  concludes
the debate. I shall now put the question in relation to the adoption of  the
report. As the decision is  dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether all the delegation  heads  are
present in  the  Chamber  to  cast  their  provinces'  votes.  Are  all  the
delegation heads present?

HON MEMBERS: Yes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Yes,  present.
In accordance with rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity

Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
      AFFAIRS - INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, our obligation to become party to the  counter-
terrorism conventions as soon as possible, as we have heard, stems from  the
commitments South Africa has made in the  United  Nations,  the  Non-Aligned
Movement and the African Union to combat terrorism.

Paragraph 3(b) of Resolution 1373,  2001,  adopted  by  the  United  Nations
Security Council at its 4 385th meeting on 28  September  2001,  a  mere  17
days after the tragic events of 11 September 2001, reads as follows:


  The Security Council decides that all states shall become parties as soon
  as possible to  the  relevant  international  conventions  and  protocols
  relating to terrorism.
In terms of article 2 of the  AU  Algiers  Convention  on  Terrorism,  state
parties undertook to consider  as  a  matter  of  priority  the  signing  or
ratification of, or accession to, the international  instruments  listed  in
the annexure thereto which they had not yet signed, ratified or acceded to.

This convention, as well as the previous one that we have acceded to  -  the
International Convention on Prevention  and  Punishment  of  Crimes  against
Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents  -  are  both
included in this annexure. South Africa is  therefore  obliged  to  urgently
consider  accession  to  the  12  international  conventions  and  protocols
dealing with terrorism. In the case of some of them  we  have  already  done
so. I think after this one today there are three left.

In the foreword to this convention, which was already signed on 18  December
1979, it is stated that:


  ... considering that the taking  of  hostages  is  an  offence  of  grave
  concern to the international community, and that in accordance  with  the
  provisions of this convention any person committing an  act  of  hostage-
  taking shall either be prosecuted or extradited, being convinced that  it
  is urgently  necessary  to  develop  international  co-operation  between
  states in devising and adopting effective measures  for  the  prevention,
  prosecution  and  punishment  of  all  acts  of  taking  of  hostages  as
  manifestations of international terrorism.

In terms of Article 1 of the convention before us, it is a crime  to  seize,
detain, threaten to kill or detain another  person  in  order  to  compel  a
third party - namely a state, international intergovernmental  organisation,
a natural or juridical person, or group of persons - to do or  abstain  from
doing any act as an implicit condition for the release of  the  hostage.  An
attempt or participation is also included. State parties must  in  terms  of
Article 2 make the above offences punishable with appropriate penalties.
In terms of the convention, state parties are obliged  to  take  appropriate
steps to ease the situation of hostages; to  secure  their  release  and  to
facilitate  their  departure;  to  take   appropriate   steps   to   prevent
preparations for offences and prohibit in its terrority  illegal  activities
of persons, groups or organisations that encourage, instigate,  organise  or
engage in the perpetration of acts  of  taking  hostages;  and  to  exchange
information  and  co-ordinate  measures  to  prevent  commission  of   these
offences.

A state party shall also establish jurisdiction over  offences  of  hostage-
taking in its territory, on board  ships  and  aircraft  registered  in  the
state, and by any of its nationals  or  stateless  persons  who  have  their
habitual stay in its territoty in order  to  compel  that  state  to  do  or
abstain from doing any act with respect to a hostage which is a national  of
that state.

State parties are further also obliged to prosecute or extradite  offenders,
to notify the United Nations of the presence of  persons  involved  and  the
outcome of prosecutions, and  to  afford  mutual  legal  assistance  to  one
another. This convention, of course, does  not  apply  when  an  offence  is
committed in a single state, the hostage and the offender are  nationals  of
that state and the alleged offender  is  found  in  the  territory  of  that
state.

The  new  antiterrorism  Bill  currently  before  the   relevant   portfolio
committee in the National Assembly, inter alia,  addresses  our  obligations
in terms of this convention and the others referred to. It is  a  pity  that
it has taken us more than  23  years,  since  18  December  1979  when  this
convention was signed in New York, to accede to it,  and  I  therefore  urge
you all unanimously to  accept  the  report  of  the  select  committee  and
thereby accede to this convention right now, so that our country can  fulfil
its international obligations regarding these matters. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! That  concludes
the debate. I shall now put the question that the report be adopted. As  the

Constitution.
    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                     AFFAIRS - SADC PROTOCOL ON FORESTRY

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, as a member of SADC, South Africa strives  to
foster regional development and economic growth  to  alleviate  poverty  and
enhance the standard of living  and  quality  of  life  of  the  peoples  of
Southern Africa through regional integration and co-operation.

In terms of the management of natural resources  and  the  environment,  our
stated objective is to achieve the sustainable use of natural resources  and
the effective protection  of  the  environment.  The  overall  goal  of  our
Government is thus to promote a thriving  regional  forestry  sector  to  be
utilised in a sustainable manner for the lasting  benefit  of  the  region's
nations.

Sixty-five per cent of South Africa is covered  by  indigenous  forests  and
woodlands. As a country, we understand that these forests are  indispensable
to our regional heritage of wildlife environment,  while  it  also  provides
important  job  and  economic  opportunities.  The  forests  support   local
industries that produce lumber, wood-pulp, paper, flooring  and  other  wood
products.

Of  equally  great  importance  is  the  diverse  range  of  other  products
indispensable to the lives of the people of South Africa. Fruits,  fish  and
game, other forest derived foods and medicinal plants are among  the  common
products  coming  from  the  indigenous  forests,  especially  in  times  of
drought. Poles and domestic construction materials are also in high demand.

The forests are the habitat for the biologically diverse range of plant  and
animal species and the ecosystem upon which the national  park  systems  and
the  tourism  industry  are  based.  They  provide  critical   environmental
functions such as moderating the local climate, regulating water  production
and conserving the soil.

The  principal  threat  to  the  future  of  forests  in  South  Africa   is
deforestation. The consequences of  deforestation  are  major  soil  erosion
that results in reduced productivity and saltation; loss of  forest  capital
and future economic benefits from the forests; loss  of  biodiversity  as  a
multitude of flora and fauna are eliminated; and change in  local  climates,
as the moderating effect of the forest is destroyed.

As a region beset by problems such as poverty and underdevelopment,  we  can
ill afford to  lose  the  contribution  which  our  forests  are  making  in
reversing these colonial legacies. For  this  contribution  to  continue  in
future, it is of fundamental importance sustainably to manage  the  region's
forests.

The SADC Protocol on Forestry is a powerful  tool  in  achieving  the  above
objectives.  It  seeks,  among  other  things,  firstly,  to   promote   the
development, conservation, sustainable management  and  utilisation  of  all
types of forests and trees; secondly, to promote trade  in  forest  products
throughout the region in order to alleviate poverty  and  generate  economic
opportunities;  and  lastly,  to  achieve  effective   protection   of   the
environment  and  safeguard  the  interests  of  the  present   and   future
generations.

South Africa has already taken the  lead  in  setting  a  good  example  for
sustainable forest management. In many  respects,  the  work  that  we  have
already done is in line with the aims and objectives of  this  protocol.  We
have a National Forest Act which provides a framework  for  the  development
of principles, criteria, indicators and  standards  for  sustainable  forest
management, both indigenous and commercial. Our local communities  are  also
actively encouraged to become  involved  in  the  management  of  indigenous
forests. In a commercial sense, stringent environmental codes and  practices
are enforced in all plantation and processing activities.

The commercial  forest  industry  is  committed  to  practising  sustainable
forest  management  and  is  promoting  rural   development   and   economic
empowerment through a small-grower afforestation programme. A key  challenge
for us lies in exporting these best practices so that they  become  standard
practice across the region.

As a leading country in the region, we have the responsibility to assist  in
strengthening institutional support for  sustainable  forest  management  in
our SADC neighbours. The preservation of our  own  forests  is  inextricably
linked to that of our neighbours. It therefore requires  greater  commitment
from us in terms of increasing the number of qualified technical  personnel;
enhancing protection from fire and animal damage; creating  shared  resource
databases and keeping them  up  to  date;  enhancing  capacity  of  research
institutions within the region;  sharing  information  adequately  with  the
region; and providing cost-effective approaches to research,  education  and
training, industrial development and  data  colletion  across  our  national
boundaries.

The select committee wants to propose the ratification  of  this  particular
protocol. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  I  shall  now
