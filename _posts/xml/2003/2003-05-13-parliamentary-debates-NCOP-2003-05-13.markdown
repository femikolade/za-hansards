  SWEARING IN OF PERMANENT DELEGATES AND THE ELECTION OF CHAIRPERSON OF THE
                                    NCOP

The JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE CAPE HIGH COURT: Hon members,  this  Plenary  has
been called for the swearing-in  ceremony  of  permanent  delegates  to  the
NCOP, as well as the election of its Chairperson. In terms of section 62  of
the Constitution, every permanent delegate of the NCOP has to make  an  oath
or subscribe  to  the  solemn  affirmation  before  performing  his  or  her
functions in the Council.

A delegate is entitled to making  an  oath  or  subscribing  to  the  solemn
affirmation in the official language of his or her own choice. It  has  been
arranged that the delegates will make the oaths or  solemn  affirmations  in
language groups. Will delegates, when their names  are  called  out,  please
take their places in front of the Table in their groups, as pre-arranged.

I will request the clerk  to  read  the  oath  and  solemn  affirmation,  as
prescribed, in terms of section 4 of schedule 2 of the Constitution, in  the
various official languages, after which delegates must respond  individually
by saying "I do" when making the solemn affirmation,  or  by  raising  their
right hands and saying "so help me God" when making the oath.

Will the secretary announce and read the names of the members in the  group,
please.

Conclusion of oaths and solemn affirmations.

The JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE CAPE HIGH COURT:  We  will  now  proceed  to  the
election of a  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP.  I  wish  to  announce  that  the
Returning Officer is the Secretary to Parliament,  Mr  Sindiso  Mfenyane.  I
wish to announce further that, in terms of Rule  2  of  the  Rules  for  the
Election of a Chairperson, Ms L L Matyolo, Mr B V L Momoti, Ms J Borien  and
Mr B N Nonyane have been appointed by the  Returning  Officer  as  Assistant
Returning Officers.

I wish to announce further, that the oath or affirmation  has  already  been
administered to the Returning Officer and Assistant Returning  Officers,  as
required by the Rules.

Before calling for nominations I wish to remind delegates that, in terms  of
the Constitution and the Rules, each nomination must  be  submitted  on  the
prescribed  form  and  duly  seconded.  Furthermore,  I  wish  to  draw  the
attention of the delegates, specifically to section 64 of the  Constitution,
in terms of which no person may be elected as a Chairperson of the  Council,
unless he or she is a permanent delegate of the Council.

I also wish to inform delegates that, in terms  of  item  4  of  Part  A  of
Schedule 3 to the Constitution, there may be no debate whatsoever.

There will  now  be  an  opportunity  for  nominations  for  Chairperson  of
Council.

THE PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): My lord, Judge  President,
I rise to  nominate  the  hon  member  Grace  Naledi  Mandisa  Pandor  as  a
Chairperson of this NCOP.

The JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE CAPE HIGH COURT: Thank you, Mr Dipico. Ms  Naledi
Pandor has been nominated. Is the nomination seconded?

Mr M C VAN SCHALKWYK: Judge President, I would like to second  Mrs  Pandor's
nomination.

The JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE CAPE HIGH COURT: Thank  you,  Mr  van  Schalkwyk.
Please present the nomination form to the Returning Officer. Are  there  any
further nominations? [Interjections.]

Can I nominate  myself?  [Laughter.]  Are  there  any  further  nominations,
please?

Hon MEMBERS: No.

The JUDGE PRESIDENT OF THE CAPE HIGH COURT: Thank you. Since  there  are  no
further nominations, that concludes the business for nominations.  Only  one
candidate has been nominated namely, Ms Naledi Pandor. [Applause.] May I  go
on to say that the nomination is in order, in terms of item 5 of Part  A  of
Schedule 3 to the Constitution.  I  accordingly  declare  Ms  Naledi  Pandor
elected Chairperson of the NCOP.

On behalf of  all  present,  I  congratulate  you  on  having  been  elected
Chairperson of the NCOP. Now I invite you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank  you  to  the  hon  Judge  President  for
having stepped in so kindly to assist  us  this  afternoon.  I  should  also
proceed to  congratulate  those  newly  sworn-in  members  of  the  National
Council of Provinces.  I  would  like,  before  we  proceed,  to  take  this
opportunity to refer to some of the challenges that we are  confronted  with
as a House, as  a  consequence  of  the  signing  into  law  of  the  second
amendment to the Constitution.

We have been faced this afternoon, as you witnessed, with the need to  swear
in permanent delegates who lost their seats by  virtue  of  the  legislation
that I have referred to. In section 61(2)(b) of the  Constitution,  we  find
this: That if the composition of a  provincial  legislature  is  changed  on
account  of  changes  of  party   membership,   mergers   between   parties,
subdivisions of parties or any change that is referred to within the  second
amendment  Act,  the  legislature  should  within  30  days  determine,   in
accordance with the national legislation referred to in paragraph  (a),  the
number of each party's delegates who are to be permanent delegates  and  the
number who are to  be  special  delegates,  and  to  appoint  the  permanent
delegates in accordance with the nominations of the parties.

Section 62(3) of the Constitution indicates  that  permanent  delegates  are
appointed for a term that expires (a) immediately before the  first  sitting
of the provincial legislature after its next election or,  (b)  on  the  day
before the appointment of permanent delegates  in  accordance  with  section
61(2)(b)(ii) takes effect.

Our recent experiences highlighted  the  fact  that  the  implementation  of
these provisions has an unintended consequence which  in  my  view  requires
attention. The current effect of section 62(3)(b) is that  where  there  are
any changes in a provincial legislature in terms of  section  61(2)(b),  all
permanent delegates, including those whose parties were  not  impacted  upon
by the changes  arising  from  crossing  of  the  floor  in  the  provincial
legislature, lose their membership of the National Council of Provinces.

Members will surely appreciate that such an outcome places this House in  an
invidious position in that we  have  to  reconstitute  ourselves  each  time
there are changes in the  composition  of  provincial  legislatures  arising
from floor crossing which may affect a small proportion of the members of  a
legislature.

There are also  difficulties  related  to  the  situation  where  provincial
legislatures have failed to appoint the permanent delegates within  the  30-
day period which is stipulated in the legislation.  I  think  the  important
lesson that we as members can take from  this  experience  is  that  we  are
reminded once more of how vital it is that legislation is carefully  drafted
by ourselves in our committee work and that  we  ensure  at  all  times,  as
public representatives, that legislation clearly conveys the  intentions  of
Parliament.

It is difficult to accept that it could have been the logical  intention  of
Parliament that  at  each  change  that  occurs  in  the  composition  of  a
provincial  legislature,  the  entire  permanent  delegation  would  require
swearing in by a judge, given that it is not a  casual  vacancy,  and  would
require the election of office-bearers once more. All  of  these  unintended
consequences arise from the present formulation of the Act and, in my  view,
require urgent attention from the committees of this House as well  as  from
Parliament generally.

Those of you who are puzzled, that is an indication of the changes  and  the
challenges that have arisen from the Constitution of the Republic  of  South
Africa Second Amendment Act, Act 21 of 2002.

Having outlined those  challenges  to  you  and  hoping  that  the  relevant
committees will take up these matters, allow me to thank you,  hon  members,
for having shown confidence in  me  once  more.  I  wondered  for  a  moment
whether I should not decline nomination since I failed to ensure  that  such
legislation did pass before these walls. It also seems to be fairly  strange
that this day is the day on which my mother died exactly one year ago and  I
wonder what all of this might mean.

With those words, I thank you and hope that we will ensure that  we  address
this invidious situation in which we find ourselves. [Applause.]

                           STATEMENT OF CONDOLENCE

                         (The late Mr W M U Sisulu)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, before  I  proceed  may  I  take
this opportunity of congratulating you on  your  appointment.  It  is  clear
from the response you have received from the House that you enjoy  the  full
confidence of this House and we are pleased to note that  you  have  resumed
your seat with the necessary authority  and  confidence  as  you  have  done
hitherto.

Chairperson, we also share with you in the  grief  that  you  may  be  going
through today on the anniversary of your mum's death and we certainly  share
and empathise with you on this particular day.

In relation to the statement that we  have  to  make  in  this  Council,  we
remember a great revolutionary, a giant of the  freedom  struggle  of  South
Africa, Walter Sisulu. Thousands of  people  across  South  Africa  and  the
world have paid tribute to this giant  of  a  man.  Editorials  abound  with
descriptions of his wisdom,  resilience,  courage,  nobility  and  humility.
Perhaps it would be appropriate  to  quote  from  our  former  President  in
relation to the passing away of Tata Sisulu. He had the following to say.


  Xhamela is no more ... His absence has carved a void. A  part  of  me  is
  gone. We shared the joy of living and the pain. Together we shared ideas,
  forged common commitments. We walked side by side to the valley of death,
  nursing each other's bruises,  holding  each  other  up  when  our  steps
  faltered. Together we savoured the taste of freedom. From the  moment  we
  first met, he has been my friend, my brother, my keeper and my comrade.

Our President Thabo Mbeki had the following to say:


  South Africa's beloved friend and statesman of liberation, Walter  Sisulu
  has passed out of this life. He was a massive force of enlightenment  and
  freedom and earned his place in the annals of history together with great
  figures like  O  R  Thambo  who  pursued  the  struggle  with  unflagging
  determination in the dark and difficult days of apartheid.

As we remember, Walter Sisulu  was  born  in  the  year  that  the  ANC  was
established and unwaveringly committed himself to  the  liberation  of  this
country and the establishment of a nonracial,  nonsexist  and  united  South
Africa. We should ponder and reflect briefly on the kind of  qualities  that
he had as a person. We hear or read from George Bizos,  a  very  experienced
and senior advocate, how he sustained five days of cross-examination  during
the famous Rivonia trial and during that period held the moral  high  ground
in terms of the struggle of the Blacks in a very repressive  and  oppressive
system. We hear and learn from the fact that as a result of  his  composure,
patience, wisdom and sincerety, the  people  who  were  subjected  to  these
trials were in fact saved from the noose.

We hear from his son, Max  Sisulu  how  he,  accompanying  his  dad  to  the
offices of the African National Congress,  on  their  way  to  do  Christmas
shopping, came across some children who were very  poor  and  Walter  Sisulu
took the money that he had with him for purposes  of  purchasing  items  for
Christmas and handed it over to the  poorest  of  the  poor.  This  in  fact
reflects a particular character of Walter Sisulu.

We also know that not only was he a liberator, a  person  committed  to  the
struggle for freedom, but he imbued in his family, friends and comrades  the
importance of the value of education. We have  read  that  when  he  was  in
prison on Robben Island, he had learnt that Max Sisulu, his son, who  was  a
chief whip in the National Assembly, had wanted to join  the  military  wing
of the African National Congress.  He  wrote  to  his  dear  wife  Albertina
Sisulu, and may God  give  her  strength  during  this  difficult  time,  to
indicate to her that he should first complete his education before he  joins
the military. This means that he has always  emphasised  the  importance  of
education and enlightenment  in  the  pursuit  of  the  leadership  of  this
country.

His life, commitment and resilience is a monument to  the  people  of  South
Africa. As we think about him, we think about those, such as  Oliver  Thambo
and Govan Mbeki who possessed a quiet confidence, the wisdom,  determination
and the humility to lead this  country.  He  has  served  the  ANC  and  his
leadership, he has been a counsellor and a mentor to great people and  great
leaders such as Nelson Mandela.  He  in  fact  was  responsible  for  Nelson
Mandela being mobilised into the African National Congress Youth League  and
he had an important role as he did so.

 Another attribute of this  great  soul  was  his  ability  to  ensure  that
decisions were debated robustly. Nelson Mandela speaks about the  fact  that
while they were incarcerated they would debate robustly various  issues  and
they would disagree but were never alienated or estranged from  each  other.
They preserved  the  friendship,  the  support  and  they  walked  together.
Another significant attribute of what Sisulu had  brought  to  this  country
and to this nation is the fact that leadership cannot  exist  in  a  vacuum,
that it is all about collective decisions and  he  was  largely  responsible
for bringing the ethic of debate and consensus into the ANC.

As we stand here and reflect on the greatness of this man,  I  think  it  is
important that we remember the grief and the suffering that  his  family  is
going through and this Council conveys  its  sincerest  condolences  to  his
children, grandchildren and members of his family. We believe from  what  we
have read, what we have heard and seen that the  entire  nation  mourns  the
loss of Walter Sisulu. And, I believe Chairperson  that  it  is  appropriate
that we dedicate this debate that we  have  today  as  we  speak  about  our
freedom, democracy and development in  the  country  to  our  stalwart,  our
giant, Walter Sisulu.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, dit is 'n voorreg om 'n paar woorde te  sê  oor
so 'n merkwaardige groot Suid-Afrikaner soos wyle Walter Sisulu  en  om  hom
te  salueer.  Hy  was,   volgens   Ahmed   Kathrada,   die   man   wat   die
spreekwoordelike hekke oopgemaak het vir Suid-Afrikaners van alle rasse,  om
deel te wees van die vrye demokratiese bestel wat ons vandag het toe hy  die
leiding  gegee  het  om  die  destydse  ANC  te  laat  afsien  van  'n  eng,
eksklusiewe Afrikanasionalisme. Daarvoor moet ons hom altyd eer en  dankbaar
wees.  Sy  nederigheid,  wysheid  en  innemendheid  is  vir  ons  almal   'n
voorbeeld. Sy oplossingsgerigtheid en positiewe  ingesteldheid  selfs  onder
baie moeilike omstandighede - soos blyk uit die laaste sin van  sy  artikel,
``We shall overcome'', geskryf terwyl hy op Robbeneiland in die tronk was  -
kan vir ons almal as aansporing dien en ook soos die agb Hoofsweep  van  die
Raad gesê het, is dit ook van toepassing op ons debat vandag:
  In the history of mankind, it is a law of life that problems  arise  when
  the conditions are there for their solution.

Ons diepste meegevoel gaan met al sy familie en naasbestaandes. Ek  dank  u.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATHEE: Chairperson, it is a privilege to  say  a  few  words  about
such a distinguished South African as the late Walter Sisulu and  to  salute
him. He was, according to Ahmed Kathrada, the man who opened the  proverbial
gates for South Africans of all races to be  part  of  the  free  democratic
dispensation which we have today when he took the lead in  guiding  the  ANC
at that time to renounce a narrow, exclusive African  nationalism.  We  must
always honour him and be grateful to him for that. His humility, wisdom  and
grace serve as an example to all of us. His solution-directed  and  positive
disposition even under very trying circumstances - as clearly shown  by  the
last sentence of his article, ``We shall overcome'', written  while  he  was
still in prison on Robben Island - can serve as an inspiration to all of  us
and, as the hon Chief Whip of the Council said, is applicable to our  debate
today:


  In the history of mankind, it is a law of life that problems  arise  when
  conditions are there for their solution.

Our deepest sympathy goes to his whole family and next of  kin.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, may I profess my remarks on behalf of my party  to
congratulate you on your re-election to the Chair.

The official opposition, the Democratic Alliance, joins  the  South  African
nation in mourning the demise of the late Walter Sisulu  who  had  succumbed
strikingly to the final call of death, the great leveller in  our  lives  on
Monday 5 May 2003. From all accounts Mr  Sisulu  was  the  source  of  great
inspiration to the leaders  and  the  vanguard  of  the  titanic  liberation
struggle for freedom and democracy in our beloved South Africa.
A formidable opponent of the apartheid regime, and  as  the  member  of  the
illustrious triumvirate comprising his colleagues the late Mr  Oliver  Tambo
and Mr Nelson Mandela in the vanguard of the struggle, Walter Sisulu  strode
the political firmament of this land like a  veritable  colossus.  My  party
salutes a surveillant and intrepid  fighter  against  racial  discrimination
and denial of human rights.  Having  served  incarceration  as  a  political
prisoner on Robben Island, for over  a  quarter  of  a  century,  Mr  Sisulu
emerged unscathed with his integrity in tact as on  the  day  he  was  taken
prisoner, with remarkable stoicism and profound belief in  the  justness  of
the cause he espoused; the cause of a nonracial democracy for and  in  South
Africa.

With  unimpeachable  integrity,  and  impeccable  credentials  as  a  family
person, a caring husband and father, Mr  Sisulu  had  endeared  himself  not
only to his immediate family and friends but to the nation as a  whole.  One
who  shunned  the  limelight,  and  who  eschewed  pomp   and   status,   he
nevertheless remained behind the curtains as a powerful prop to ensure  that
others enjoy the glow of publicity and approbation. We salute the great  man
for his human efforts in laying the solid foundation for  the  democracy  we
nurture today. We join the Sisulu family, the Soweto community, the  African
National Congress, the South African nation and the international  community
in mourning the loss of this great South African son.

With apologies to the great Bard of Avon William Shakespeare, this  was  the
noblest of them all, his life was gentle and all the elements  so  mix'd  in
him, that Nature might stand up and say to  all  the  world,  ``This  was  a
man''.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, first of all I wish to congratulate you on  your
reappointment. Following in the steps of Mr Raju's eloquency I choose to  be
very brief, but remain right in the centre of the whole thing, and say  that
the sudden death of the late Walter Sisulu has left not  only  this  country
but the entire community devastated. He was indeed and still is an  icon  of
international repute who could rise above party politics  to  the  level  of
humanity.

He was a member of the African National Congress  but  he  belonged  to  the
human race. He was a monument larger than life.

Kufa, awunamahloni ngokusithathela iqhawe  lethu.  Kufa  ngabe  luphi  udosi
lwakho na? Thina be-IFP sithi ulale ngokuthula,  Xhamela!  To  the  bereaved
family of Sisulu we say, ``Nilale ngenxeba. Akwehlanga  lungehli''.  [Death,
you are a disgrace for taking our hero away from us. Death,  where  is  your
sting? We, the IFP,  say,  ``May  you  rest  in  peace,  Xhamela''.  To  the
bereaved family of Sisulu we say, ``May you be comforted''.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: I rise to express the  UDM's  condolences  to  the  bereaved
family members of the late Walter Sisulu especially to his wife.  We,  South
Africa's citizens, owe many thanks and gratitude to the people like him  for
the total and protracted commitment towards the liberation of its people.
When asked by methodist clergy George Emhaulzer and Professor Herbert  Shore
what was going through his  mind  when  he  was  awaiting  sentence  at  the
Rivonia trial, and expecting the  death  penalty,  the  hon  Comrade  Sisulu
responded as follows: ``I was thinking how I must go to the gallows,  and  I
thought I must go to the gallows singing for  the  sake  of  the  youth  who
follow us so that they will know that we fulfilled  our  task  in  life.  We
must show that our death must not mark the end but would be  an  inspiration
to our people''

There could be no better way  for  the  comrade  to  adequately  depict  the
extent and magnitude of one's commitment to the liberation of one's people.

Etlela hi ku rhula nkulukumba. [Rest in peace, sir.]

Mr  J  O  TLHAGALE:  Madam  Chairperson,  thank  you  very  much   for   the
opportunity. It is not very common except by  the  grace  of  God  that  the
person realises the fruition of his long-term aspirations during his or  her
lifetime. Today we are proud of a stalwart of Tata Sisulu's calibre who  has
lived to witness the liberation and formation of a democratic  South  Africa
that he struggled and suffered for. We have known Tata Sisulu  as  a  gentle
and humble person, a people's person and a very  intimate  family  man.  May
his soul rest in peace. May his family and fellow comrades in the  ANC  know
that their loss is our loss.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I just want to associate myself with  the  words
of congratulations to you on your re-election. It is an honour to say a  few
words about Walter Sisulu. There are four qualities that comes to mind  that
stand out for me when one looks across his great  life.  They  are  courage,
humility,  family  values  and  nonracialism.  Nonracialism   was   a   huge
contribution that he made. We in  the  ACDP  associate  ourselves  with  the
motion in his honour and with the words moved by the Chief Whip  and  by  my
colleagues.

  Our  deepest  condolences  go  out  to  Mrs  Sisulu  and  to  his  family.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I thank hon members  for  their  expression  of
condolences and join them in that expression. Our struggle  for  freedom  in
our country has given rise to many ironies  and  anomalies.  Great  men  and
women have had no public recognition and were  often  rendered  criminal  in
their efforts for democracy.

Their commitment to universally recognised human rights was not a gift  they
themselves personally enjoyed although they strived for  this  character  in
our society. Family, friends and colleagues often became  absent  companions
for these heroes and heroines.

Tata Sisulu's life reflects all these anomalies. Yet he  has  a  distinction
above all heroes in that he humbly turned away recognition of greatness.  He
never sought public acknowledgement,  preferring  as  we  all  no  know  the
innocence of needy children as his great cause, rather than  popular  issues
of the day.

Our task as those who remain will be to  ensure  that  unlike  the  fate  of
Ceasar, the good of Tata Sisulu should not be interred with his bones.  Tata
Sisulu would, I am sure, urge us from mourning to action: action as  to  how
we will remember him and the many who were his companions  in  the  struggle
for freedom and justice in our country, action as to what  we  shall  do  in
our schools, our cultural institutions, our publishing  houses,  our  media,
to ensure that the principles and values he upheld and  promoted  are  never
forgotten; action to ensure democracy and freedom thrive  in  South  Africa.
We will live up to his great expectations if we  maintain  action  of  these
ideals.

Tata Sisulu, we will strive not to fail you. Rest in peace. Your  spear  has
fallen, but you have succeeded. You built a rearguard able to pick  up  your
spear and raise it high in support of democracy and the ideals you  suffered
so long for.

We send our sympathies to Ma Sisulu and the entire  Sisulu  family  as  this
National Council.

  (1) notes with sadness the bus accident in the Northern Cape on  Workers'
       Day, 1 May, which claimed the lives of 51 people;

       for their support in alleviating the suffering of the families of the
       victims;


  (4) commends  the  President  of  our  country  for  the  commitment  and
       dedication he has shown in  his  support  for  the  families  of  the
       victims; and

                      TRAGIC ACCIDENT IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the  tragic  accident  in  Bulwer,  KwaZulu-Natal,
       which claimed the lives of six people;


  (2) expresses its shock at reports that the bodies of  the  victims  were
       left to lie next to the wrecked vehicle for  12  hours  before  being
       removed by the police;


  (3) believes this delay in removing the bodies was unnecessary and showed
       an utter lack  of  appreciation  by  traffic,  police  and  emergency
       authorities in the area of the standards of service delivery required
       from public officials; and


  (4) calls on the relevant  provincial  departments  to  investigate  this
       delay in removing the victims' bodies as a matter of urgency.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  BARBARIC ASSAULT OF FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD GIRL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with deep concern  the  indecent  and  barbaric  assault  of  a
       fifteen year-old girl in Kempton Park last month;


  (2) further notes that the perpetrators, who are reported to  be  Chinese
       nationals, allegedly forced the victim to have sex with a dog  whilst
       they were looking on, have already appeared in court;


  (3) condemns in the extreme, on behalf of all the people of South Africa,
       this incident and all other forms of violence against children, women
       and vulnerable groups;


  (4) believes that violence and abuse of this nature are contrary  to  the
       values and spirit of our democratic society; and


  (5)  appreciates  the  efforts  made  by  the  relevant   law-enforcement
       authorities to deal with this repulsive transgression  expeditiously,
       whilst at the same time sending out strong signals that  any  similar
       forms of abuse would encounter the full force of the law.

                   CELEBRATION OF INTERNATIONAL NURSES DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  International Nurses Day is celebrated every year on 12  May  on
           the anniversary of Florence Nightingale's birthday - this year's
           theme is "Fighting the Aids stigma and caring for all";


       (b)  nurses are  the  frontline  caring,  giving  professionals  whom
           patients interact with most often;


       (c)  many nurses work 24 hours a day, seven days a  week  and  almost
           every  holiday  and  weekend,  at  times  under  very  difficult
           conditions;


  (2) honours the 172 300 nurses of South Africa and thanks them for  being
       kind-hearted to us, and taking care of us when we need them the  most
       and for their compassion and understanding; and


  (3) calls on all members to carry them in their prayers and  to  ask  the
       Lord to strengthen them in their selfless service and to enable  them
       to bring joy to the lives of those that they serve.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I have a note here which is  supposed  to  have
been directed to the hon Botha, perhaps by a person who  is  not  a  genuine
member  of  the  ANC,  asking  if  the  hon   Botha   could   indicate   the
characteristics which give rise to a person being  described  in  that  way.
So, perhaps hon Botha, I will direct the member to you.

       collision between two minibus taxis near Umzinto in KwaZulu-Natal;
  (2) regrets the loss of young lives, most of whom were schoolchildren;


  (3) further regrets that the accident could have  been  avoided  had  the
       taxi drivers been more vigilant and refrained from playing the often-
       played game of "chicken";


  (4) calls on all road users,  passengers  and  pedestrians  to  be  extra
       vigilant on the roads and to adhere  to  the  traffic  rules  at  all
       times; and


  (5) offers its deepest condolences to the families  and  friends  of  the
       victims.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              EFFECTS OF THE DROUGHTS IN PARTS OF SOUTH AFRICA

           the inevitable consequences of drought and  the  Mugabe-inspired
           Zimbabwean economic implosion.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move the motion as printed  in
my name on the Order Paper:


  That, notwithstanding the provision of Joint Rule 138(1)(b), the  Council
  ratify the following decision of the Speaker of the National Assembly and
  the Chairperson of the Council, acting jointly after consulting the Chief
  Whip of the majority party in the Assembly and  the  Chief  Whip  of  the

dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution. I will therefore  ask
delegation heads to  indicate  the  votes  of  their  provinces.  Before  we
proceed to voting I shall first  allow  provinces  an  opportunity  to  make
their declaration of vote in terms of Rule 71, if they wish  to  do  so.  Is
there any province wishing to make a declaration of vote? There is none.  We
therefore proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  This  shall  be  done  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads  should  indicate  whether
they vote in favour, against or abstain from voting. The Eastern Cape?

Ms B  N  DLULANE:  IMpuma  Koloni  iyayixhasa  ingxelo.  [The  Eastern  Cape

    NINE YEARS OF DEMOCRACY: THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT IN PROMOTING FREEDOM,
                  DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  MAHLANGU):  Chairperson,  may  I
first  and  foremost  begin  by  congratulating  you  on  your  election  as
chairperson. I have been hearing my colleagues here - though  they  did  not
say it very loud - that we did not tell them in  time  that  they  can  also
stand and therefore they did not have enough time to lobby  for  their  best
horses to stand. At the same time I wish to congratulate all those who  have
been renominated and have been sworn in today. I also thank  very  much  the
permanent member from the Free State for joining this House.

When we as new members of Parliament entered Parliament for the  first  time
in 1994, I suspect that few of us knew that the  task  of  transforming  the
old  authoritarian  apartheid  structures  into  well-oiled,  effective  and
responsive systems capable of delivering democracy would be such  a  mammoth
one. As in almost every structure and institution in  the  country,  radical
transformation  was   needed   to   give   practical   expression   to   the
constitutional vision of an interactive, participatory and  people-sensitive
democracy.

Parliament and Government's  role  is  to  pursue  the  realisation  of  the
constitutional mandate to promote the newly-established democracy. In  terms
of the  Constitution,  Parliament's  role  with  regard  to  development  of
democracy  includes,  amongst  other  things,  the   following:   Initiating
legislation that promotes various elements of democracy; ensuring  that  the
draft legislation emanating from the Executive conforms to the  Constitution
and is effective in promoting democracy; exercising oversight over  spending
and budget reprioritisation; exercising oversight over  the  development  of
government  policy;  exercising  oversight  over   the   implementation   of
legislation and policy;  helping  to  determine  the  normative  content  of
constitutional rights and  supporting  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of
local government in its delivery of basic services.  Providing  the  support
by legislative and other measures would do this.

For  most  of  the  20th   century,   sectors   of   our   population   were
disenfranchised and the majority of the population  was  excluded  from  the
South  African  polity.  The  democratic  elections  in  1994  installed   a
Parliament that now reflects the demographic composition of the  country  to
a  far  greater  extent  than  ever  before.  Inevitably,   this   increased
representativeness brought  with  it  a  new  culture  that  had  widespread
ramifications  for  Parliament's  role  in  developing  our   constitutional
democracy. Our Parliament is a beacon of representative democracy. This  new
era in the history of our country  offered  institutions  of  democracy  the
opportunity and potential  of  representing  the  true  aspirations  of  the
people of  South  Africa.  These  institutions  previously  represented  the
interests of a minority and in no manner reflected the values of  democracy,
accountability and a people-centered approach to development.

The first challenge therefore of our Parliament  was  to  become  an  active
agent in the constitutional project of transforming the country and  not  to
be relegated to the sidelines. The basic objective of human  development  is
to enlarge the range of  people's  choices  in  particular  with  regard  to
access to income and  employment  opportunities,  education,  health  and  a
clean and safe physical  environment  in  order  to  make  development  more
democratic  and  participatory.   Sustained   poverty   reduction   requires
equitable growth, but it also  requires  that  poor  people  have  political
power. And the best way to achieve that in a manner  consistent  with  human
development objectives is by building strong and deep  forms  of  democratic
governance at all levels of society.
Democracies are notably better in meeting the most pressing social needs  of
citizens. Democratic participation is a critical end of  human  development,
not just a means of achieving it. The liberation  of  the  country  did  not
automatically bring about prosperity. The  need  to  address  socio-economic
challenges was thus placed high on Parliament's agenda. The  basis  for  the
role of Parliament in the  development  agenda  could  be  cemented  by  the
following: The electoral mandates give Parliament  a  degree  of  legitimacy
that civil society lacks and Parliament provides  a  forum  for  building  a
multiparty consensus on poverty-reduction priorities. Parliament's  approval
is required to enact budgets and legislation needed  to  implement  poverty-
reduction  strategies.   It   could   facilitate   greater   civil   society
participation and could further strengthen representational capacity.  Also,
links between MPs and constituents is  a  useful  tool  in  building  public
awareness of poverty reduction and development efforts.

Parliaments  often  face   significant   human   resources   and   financial
constraints. However, Parliament's goals have been to provide a wider  range
of options  for  parliamentarians  and  to  build  capacity  to  allow  more
opportunities for parliamentary engagement. With regard  to  implementation,
it identified that raising public  awareness  through  constituent  outreach
activities  would  enable  parliamentarians  to   play   a   key   role   in
disseminating  information  about  development  programmes  and   it   would
simultaneously  develop  public  demand  for  successful  implementation  of
programmes. In reviewing legislation  or  budgets,  legislatures  had  drawn
attention to  inconsistencies  between  draft  legislation  and  development
policies. Parliament's role does not end there. It has also,  in  compliance
with its constitutional mandate, performed oversight over the  executive  by
receiving  information  from  constituents  about  problems   in   programme
implementation.

More than that Chairperson, you would agree with me that  the  NGOs  play  a
very vital role also in playing  the  oversight  function  in  collaboration
with our committees in Parliament. That is a very critical point  which  did
not happen in the apartheid era. Now given the links of the  constituencies,
legislators are in a position to see  the  impact  of  programmes  in  their
districts and to ensure domestic accountability for  the  implementation  of
those programmes. Indeed Chairperson, our  Parliament  and  parliamentarians
have laid a foundation for the essential contribution to  poverty  reduction
by: Firstly, performing legislative duties such as scrutinising  budgets  to
ensure transparent and effective  use  of  public  resources;  secondly,  by
encouraging governments to deliver on their  commitments;  and  thirdly,  by
strengthening  accountability  through  parliamentary  committees   and   by
reaching out to all groups of citizens they  represent  and  ensuring  their
inclusion in government processes.

Chairperson, I would also like to share with you that  our  Parliament  does
not only play a developmental role in the domestic matters or internally  in
our country, but also in Africa as a whole. You would  agree  with  me  that
our Parliament recently has played  a  very  vital  role  in  launching  the
African Union in Durban in July 2002. And it also played a very  vital  role
in organising the World Summit on Sustainable  Development.  Our  Parliament
is also expanding bilateral relations to promote trade  investment  and  co-
operation in various fields with a  view  to  advancing  the  goals  of  our
developmental agenda. Our Parliament also has played a very  vital  role  in
the creation of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  and  it  will  give  concrete
expression to  the  vision  of  a  united,  integrated  and  strong  Africa.
Parliament  must  play  a  role  also  in   achieving   the   socio-economic
development  of  the  continent,  particularly  as  detailed  in   the   New
Partnership for Africa's Development.

Chairperson, you would also agree that the House would agree  with  me  that
Parliament conducted its business during this period in accordance with  the
spirit and letter of the Constitution. We have respected  our  Constitution,
we have done everything in our best to pass the laws that are  being  placed
upon us by  the  Constitution  that  will  transform  this  country  and  do
whatever possible that we are supposed to do as politicians.  The  doors  of
Parliament for the first time have been open for the public to  engage  with
Government, and also to engage with Parliament itself in the way  of  public
participation and also giving their voice, or airing  their  voice,  to  the
government that represents them if they are not  happy  about  what  we  are
delivering to them.

Parliament is the link between Government and the people.  That  is  why  we
are encouraging our people to continuously  participate  in  the  issues  of
Parliament and Government. The laws that we are making  are  the  laws  that
are promoting democracy and must therefore be the  laws  also  that  promote
development in the country as a  whole.  Our  country  has  a  programme  of
action regarding the way  in  which  the  people  are  to  be  governed  and
Parliament had to look into the Constitution to  determine  what  laws  best
promote and protect democracy.

Parliament has also been conscious of the regional efforts that promote  and
protect   democracy.   Apart   from   domestic   and    regional    efforts,
parliamentarians had to be able to ensure that domestic laws  were  in  line
with the international instruments  for  the  protection  and  promotion  of
democracy. The political transformation of  the  institution  of  Parliament
has  been  accompanied  by   far-reaching   administrative   transformation.
Parliament went from being a part-time rubber stamp to a  full-time  vibrant
place of work, almost overnight.

To consolidate democracy in a country  with  a  divided  and  violent  past,
democratic  tradition  and  an  urgent  need   for   social   and   economic
transformation is by no means an easy task. But it is the project  that  the
Constitution  demands   from   the   Government   and   the   representative
institutions of South Africa. To cite but  a  few  things,  we  now  in  our
parliaments have women taking part in  the  decision-making  structures,  in
government structures as well as in political  structures.  Disabled  groups
are participating in our Government and Parliament  and  also  in  political
structures and in many,  many  other  structures  that  take  our  democracy
forward.

The rural areas, which were neglected as bantustan areas  in  the  apartheid
era, have a voice in the development of this country and have a  voice  also
in promoting democracy in this country according to  our  Constitution.  The
international world recognises South Africa as one of  the  best  countries.
We were never, never in the apartheid era recognised as a country,  but  now
we  have  a  place  in  the  international  world.  We  are  an  accountable
Government. The apartheid era government was not an accountable  government.
We respond to the needs of the people, we take questions,  we  talk  to  our
people and we listen to what they have to say. The voice of the poor,  as  I
have already said, in those areas out there, are now  being  taken  care  of
and they have a chance to talk to us.  Our  old  mothers  and  fathers,  our
youth, the ladies, everyone has an opportunity to talk to us in  Government.
This is how we have promoted democracy in this country.  This  is  how  this
Parliament has played a role in developmental issues in the country.

In conclusion, we enter the next decade  of  democracy  with  no  hesitation
about the extent to which democracy has  taken  root  in  our  society.  The
progress that we have made is due to  the  intervention  of  Parliament  and
provincial  legislatures  in  setting  the  parameters  and  direction   for
transformation in devoted attention to  draft  legislation  and  interaction
with the citizenry. And I would like to say thank you to  the  leaders  like
the late Comrade Sisulu, Comrade Mandela,  and  O  R  Tambo  who  made  this
democracy a success. It is upon us to see  that  it  proceeds  and  that  we
develop this country as we are expected to do by the Constitution.

Mnu L SUKA: Enkosi, Mhlalingaphambili.

Andizi kuba mde, ndiza kuba mfutshane. Ndiza  kuzathuza  nje  kwesi  sihloko
senu   sanamhlanje   esimalunga   nendima   yePalamente   ekulweni   indlala
nasekuphuculeni ubomi bethu.

Okokuqala, masikubulele ngendima oyithathileyo ngokuba uphinde unyulwe  yile
Ndlu.  Oko  ibikukubonakalisa  intembeko  kuwe.  SiliPhondo  iMpuma   Koloni
siyakuvuyela oko.  Okwesibini  ke,  asizi  kuba  ngathi  sigxwal'  emswaneni
njengoko  iqhawe  lethu  lithe  lawa.  Sithi  kumzi  wakwaSisulu   akuhlanga
lungehliyo. Sikunye nabo  kule  ntlungu  yabo.  Utata  uSisulu,  njengegorha
phakathi  kwamaninzi  e-ANC,  ungomnye   wabantu   abathe   baseka   isiseko
esiluqilima  namhlanje,  esi  sokuba  namhlanje  sithethe   ngesi   sihloko,
endicinga  ukuba  uza  kunika  ingxelo  kwabasandulelayo,   ooTat'   uTambo;
ooqabane uChris Hani nabaninzi, malunga nale ndibano sikuyo namhlanje.

Xa sithetha  ngePalamente  sithetha  ngomlomo  wabantu  abakwisininzi  kweli
loMzantsi Afrika, kunjalonje iPalamente kufuneka iziveze ngalo lonke  ixesha
ebantwini. Yindima yayo leyo. Xa iza kwenza imithetho  yeli  lizwe  kufuneka
iye   ebantwini,   ifumane   izimvo   zabo   ngokunjalo   nakumaqela   onke,
ingakhethanga  maqela  ezopolitiko  odwa  kodwa  bonke  abahlali   boMzantsi
Afrika. IPalamente kufuneka  ijongane  nokuba  iimali  zikaRhulumente  ukuba
zisebenziseka ngendlela eyiyo na ukuze ikwazi ukuphendula  xa  kufanelekile.
Le  Palamente  sikuyo  namhlanje  ibhentsise  into  yokuba  nabanina  onikwe
isikhundla kwezopolitiko akwazi ukuziveza, aze kuphendula imibuzo.  Loo  nto
ke yenziwa leli setyana  kuthiwa  yiKomiti  yePalamente.  Maxa  wambi  bathi
yiPortfolio  Committee,  yiSelect  Committee  okanye  iStanding   Committee.
Yindima ke yezo Komiti ukujongana nento  yokuba  uRhulumente  uyazenza  yaye
uyazifezekisa iimfuno zabantu ezithe zabekwa kulaa  Mthetho  ubizwa  ngokuba
nguMgaqo-siseko.

Phaya kuMgaqo-siseko isihloko  sesibini  sithetha  ngamalungelo.  Amalungelo
abantu ke amele ukuze akhuselwe yiNdlu yoWiso-Mthetho. Ukuba  iNdlu  yoWiso-
Mthetho ayijongani nesiya  sahluko  sesibini  kuMgaqo-siseko,  loo  nto  iya
kuthetha  ukuba  ayifezekanga  enye  yezinto  esimelwe  kukuzenza   ngokwale
Palamente sinayo.

Okulandelayo, le Palamente yethu inoxanduva lokuthatha  amalungu  ePalamente
la sinawo iwathumele  kumanye  amazwe  ukwenzela  ukuba  la  malungu  akwazi
ukufunda izinto ezenziwayo kwezinye iipalamente ze abuye  nobo  buchwepheshe
abufundileyo aze kuxelenga apha  phakathi  kwethu  ukwenzela  ukuba  sandise
ulwazi lwethu kuba kaloku uMzantsi Afrika lo awuphili  kwilizwe  wodwa  koko
uphila phakathi kwamazwe ngamazwe  adale  ukuba  kubekho  iinguqu  namhlanje
kweli lizwe. Ndiyithanda ngento enye ke iPalamente yethu,  loo  nto  ikukuba
le Ndlu iyisondeze ebantwini  ngoomabonakude  nangoonomathotholo,  nto  leyo
eyayingekho kooRhulumente bangaphambili. Siyambulela  uRhulumente  ngokwenza
loo nto kuba thina phaya emaphandleni asikwazi ukufikelela  apha  ngobuninzi
bethu kodwa ngenxa yokuba nicaphule kulaa ntetho ithi, 'Ukuba  ngaba  intaba
akukwazi ukufikelela kuyo, yona  mayize  kuwe'.  Nina  nenze  loo  nto  apha
namhlanje. Ndifuna ukuyibulela kwale Ndlu sikuyo apha nesakuba  yeyeengwevu;
leNdlu yamaphondo osithoba. Isiqalo enithe  nasenza  andiqondi  ukuba  sakhe
senzeka kwimbali yeli lizwe. Ukumana  nijikeleza  kula  maphondo  nisisa  le
Palamente ebantwini kuloo maphondo. Ewe, izolo oku siyazi ukuba  benikweliya
laseTranskei apho benimamele khona izimvo  zabantu.  Yindima  yenu  ke  leyo
yaye siyanincoma ngelo galelo. Ningadinwa nangomso.

Kanti ke ikwakhona nendawana  ethi  apha  ePalamente  kumele  ukuba  kubekho
igunjana okanye iofisana eza kwamkela  izikhalazo  zabahlali  okanye  zabemi
beli  ukwenzela  ukuba  amalungu  ePalamente  azihluze   ezo   zinto   ukuze
niphendule kwezo zikhalazo okanye zincomo nithe nazithunyelwa. Loo  nto  iya
kwenza ukuba iPalamente yamkeleke ngalo lonke ixesha ebantwini. Into  yokuba
oomama babe khona ePalamente siyayazi ukuba yenziwe  yimibutho  yezopolitiko
ukuze le  ingabi  yiNdlu  yamadoda  esabuhlanti  odwa.  Kambe  sicela  ukuba
namanye amaqela ezopolitiko ayenze le  nto,  angayithethi  nje  apha.  Phaya
kuthi ePhondweni sinawo amaqela angenabo oomama.  Sithi  ke  mayenzeke  kuba
indima yePalamente kukujonga ukuba oomama mababe khona  ngalo  lonke  ixesha
kwezopolitiko, ekuphuculeni ubomi babo nasekuguquleni imithetho yeli  lizwe.
Singabashiyanga ngasemva nabakhubazekileyo. Utat' uMahlangu  uhlomle  ngaloo
mba ngoko ke andizi kuyiphinda. Naleyo  ke  siyayincoma  kule  mihla  sikuyo
kuba  yayizizinto  ezazingekho  ngaphambili.    (Translation   of   isiXhosa

[Mr L SUKA: Thank you, Chairperson.

I will not be long; I will be very brief. I am going to comment  on  today's
topic that  is  about  the  role  of  Parliament  in  fighting  poverty  and
improving our lives.

Firstly, we should commend your role in this House, which necessitated  your
re-election. That was a way of showing our confidence in  you.  We,  as  the
Eastern Cape Province are happy for that. Secondly, we  will  not  bore  you
with our lamentations as one of our heroes has passed away.  We  would  like
to express our sincere condolences to the  Sisulu  family.  We  share  their
pain. Mr Sisulu, as a hero amongst many of the ANC, is  one  of  the  people
that founded a solid foundation today, which made it possible for  us  today
to talk about what we are talking about, hoping that he will give  a  report
to those who left before him, the likes of Mr Tambo, comrade Chris Hani  and
many others, about this gathering today.

When we talk about Parliament, we talk about the mouthpiece of the  majority
of South Africa, and Parliament should seek to avail itself  to  people  all
the time. When it is going to pass laws, it  must  seek  people's  views  as
well as those of different organisations, not only  political  organisations
but also all the citizens of the country. Parliament  should  manage  public
funds in an appropriate manner so that it can account when the  time  comes.
This Parliament that we are in today has informed us that everyone that  has
been in a political position should declare that  so  that  he  or  she  can
answer some questions. The Parliamentary Committee conducts that.  Sometimes
it is called the portfolio committee,  the  select  committee  or  even  the
standing committee. It is the  function  of  those  committees  to  look  at
whether the Government meets the needs of people  that  are  tabled  in  the
Constitution.

In the Constitution, clause 2 talks  about  rights.  The  National  Assembly
therefore should protect people's rights. If the National Assembly does  not
consider Chapter 2 of the Constitution, that would mean that what we have  a
responsibility to do, which we did not do.

Further to that, this Parliament has a responsibility to send  some  members
to other countries so that these members can  learn  how  other  parliaments
conduct their business. They then come back with the  knowledge  and  impart
it to us so that we could increase  our  own  knowledge  because  we  should
remember that South Africa does not  exist  in  a  vacuum,  but  it  has  to
interact with various other countries that effect changes in  this  country.
I like one thing about our Parliament and that is that it has  been  brought
closer  to  people  who  now  can  see  and  hear  the  proceedings  through
television and radio, something  that  never  existed  during  the  previous
government. We commend the Government for that responsible move so that  we,
people living in rural areas, can be able to access information and even  be
present here in our majority. You probably took the saying that  goes,  ``If
you cannot reach the mountain, the mountain must come  to  you''.  You  have
done that. I would like to commend this House, which used to be  called  the
senate, the House of the nine provinces. You have certainly set a  precedent
that was never thought of in the history  of  this  country.  Visitation  to
provinces on a rotational basis trying to bring this  Parliament  closer  to
people is a commendable exercise. Indeed, just yesterday  you  were  in  the
former Transkei are where there were public hearings. That is your role  and
you are doing it successfully. Thank you very much.

There is a suggestion also that there should  be  an  office  that  receives
public complaints so that Members of Parliament would  look  into  them  and
respond accordingly, or hear what they are  praising  us  about.  That  will
make Parliament to be always welcome to  people.  Women's  participation  in
Parliament is a hot issue that political organisations are  pushing  for  so
that this House can be equally represented by both men and  women.  However,
we would like to challenge other political organisations to do likewise.  In
our Province we have organisations that cannot boast  of  women  membership.
We are asking for that because one of the roles of Parliament is to  see  to
it that women are involved as  much  in  politics,  in  improving  lives  of
people and in changing laws of this  country.  We  could  never  forget  the
disabled persons. Hon Mahlangu  talked  much  about  that  particular  issue
therefore I will not repeat it. We commend that as  well  nowadays  as  such
issues were never mentioned before.]

I would like to conclude by saying that the role of Parliament  is  pivotal.
We cannot undermine  it,  especially  when  it  comes  to  the  question  of
oversight. You know, this issue of oversight is a very  critical  role  that
needs to be played by all public representatives especially  the  committees
because  if  committees  do  not  hold  the  Government  or  the   executive
accountable, then definitely we will be failing our mandate to  being  here.
Sometimes it is very disturbing to  find  that  a  committee  has  done  its
oversight function, but two days later you get in the press that there is  a
scam in the very same committee that you are serving on  in  relation  to  a
certain department. So we are saying that the oversight  is  very  important
and critical in our democracy.

To advance our development, especially in the  rural  communities,  we  also
want to say it is a huge challenge. Yes, Parliament  has  made  a  start  by
making our executive members accountable. I believe  that  today,  each  and
every council or district municipality has seen  an  improvement.  There  is
delivery  through  the   role   of   Parliament   to   make   those   public
representatives, who are occupying critical strategic positions, deliver  to
our people.

Sithi ke nangomso ningadinwa. Luselude uhambo. Enkosi. [We say,  thank  you.
The road is still very long ahead of us. Thank you.]

Mrs B N SONO: Thank you, Chairperson. Do I have your protection?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: It is not required in this House. [Laughter.]

Mrs N B SONO: Chairperson, I would like to align myself  largely  with  what
the last speaker has alluded to. On the freedom front more gains  have  been
made because of the role of Parliament. For instance, we  now  have  freedom
of expression and we are part of the law-making process, which we were  not.
We have freedom of movement; we are no longer subject to harassment. We  are
even able to stay in areas where we were not  previously  allowed  to  stay.
The rural people have access to basic services,  for  instance,  electricity
and there have been measurable gains made in housing.

The role of Parliament, in my humble opinion, will  be  decisive  monitoring
and improving institutional capacity to implement the  variety  of  laws  to
maximise impact on the lives of the people. For instance,  in  the  area  of
electricity, there are rural areas which  have  been  electrified,  but  the
layout of rural electrification gives a problem in the sense that one  would
find that, in areas where electricity as a service could have been  used  to
advance the economic prowess of the people, it is not available. So I  think
the role of Parliament is to see to it that implementation takes place.  The
laws that we pass here must be implemented to impact on  the  lives  of  the
people. This becomes a paramount role that we can play, also in holding  the
executive to account.
In the area of development, we as Parliament make  laws  and  set  deadlines
without the capacity to process implementation and that makes nothing but  a
mockery of the developmental plight of  the  needy.  There  are  many  state
enterprises which are set up with little planning or  projection  of  costs.
The plethora of state intervention in the  economy  have  brought  in  their
wake two interrelated problems, that is ineptitude and corruption.

At a portfolio committee meeting I asked, at some stage in  the  year  2000,
when the incumbent Director-General of the Department of Trade and  Industry
was being introduced, if we have an economic strategy. After five  years  of
democracy he said no, we did not have  one.  He  said  he  was  tasked  with
implementing and  developing  an  economic  strategy.  Even  in  yesterday's
Sowetan the Deputy Minister of  Trade  and  Industry  alluded  to  the  very
problem of the national economic strategy, especially  pertaining  to  small
business development. I quote  her,  where  she  says:  ``This  Government's
strategy for small business development is fraud'', which is true.
In front of us there will be some amendments to the National Small  Business
Act which we need to make.  We  need  to  see  how  we  could  maximise  the
Government's intervention. Our role as Parliament, once again in  my  humble
opinion, would be to see to it  that  the  executive  is  held  accountable,
because at the end of the day, from 2001 to now, R20 billion was  made  just
in black empowerment initiatives. However, right now  the  majority  of  our
people have not been economically empowered.

In the area of democracy, this Government has  carefully  crafted  Bills  of
human rights, has signed the United Nations Declaration of Human  Rights  as
well as the African Charter on Human Rights, donored by  the  OAU.  But  one
finds in respect of a lot of instances, especially in the rural areas,  that
the impact  of  intergovernmental  intervention,  especially  to  cater  for
women, has not been maximised. And it is worth noting that nine  years  into
democracy in this  country,  all  has  been  elite-managed  and  controlled.
Although civil participation is encouraged through  public  hearings,  their
input usually accounts for nothing.
The TRC saga is one case in point.  The  TRC  found  victims  in  search  of
promised services returned to  the  President  Fund  empty-handed.  The  TRC
could not get statistics from the provincial administrators to indicate  how
many victims have been assisted with health, welfare  or  housing.  I  could
even quote the Minister of Welfare, who said  in  response:  ``We  know  the
Public Service does not work.'' The Minister of Welfare said so himself.

What has been the role of Parliament? In my humble opinion,  Parliament  has
the last word on reparations. In fact, I am  very  pleased  that  hon  Surty
mentioned something like a committee being made up  of  parliamentarians  to
look into the question of reparations. I would also really urge my  comrades
here in the ANC to really, as and when, as parliamentarians,  we  look  into
the question of reparations that at the end of the  day  we  try  and  avoid
unintended consequences by our actions. I Thank you.

Mr M C MOKITLANE: Deputy Chairperson, may I also take the  opportunity  from
the Free State to congratulate Mrs Naledi Pandor on her re-election  to  the
position of the Chairperson of the NCOP.

I have difficulty in understanding the logic of the DA. I do not  know  what
else we need to say to awake them from this 40-year sleep  which  they  have
embarked upon. [Laughter.] I think that the only people who can  bring  this
reality to their attention are the masses of our people  there  in  our  own
villages, towns and townships who day after  day  applaud  the  achievements
which  have  been  reached  since  the  ushering  in   of   the   democratic
dispensation in 1994.

I cannot understand because the hon member also talks about the Minister  of
Trade and Industry and in the same breath she talks about  `she'.  I  cannot
understand really what she is trying to say when  the  hon  member  mentions
that we do not have an SMME strategy when that was just unfolded recently.

May I continue to say that  the  litmus  test  of  Parliament  in  promoting
freedom, equality and development is not to be found in  the  laws  and  the
constitutional provisions. We design, but rather in the  actual  realisation
of meaningfulness in the lives of the ordinary people.

We are people coming from a background of laws  that  were  antithetical  to
freedom, equality and development. Designing  enabling  laws  and  having  a
Constitution which central theme is the protection of  human  rights  was  a
logical imperative to set the stage for ushering in a better life  for  all.
During the nine years of democracy,  Parliament  has  indeed  set  about  to
systematically revoke any  piece  of  legislation  that  inhibited  freedom,
democracy and development in  our  country  and  establish  in  their  place
legislation  and  administrative  institutions  that  will  ensure  that  we
deliver basic services to the millions of our people  who  throughout  their
lives fought for a better life.

As Parliament, constituted of public representatives,  we  needed,  together
with our people, to identify those basic amenities which when  addressed  by
Government will signal a period of development,  equality  and  freedom.  We
needed to make electricity available to those who never had  it.  Those  who
now have the opportunity to access it are able to develop their reading  and
writing skills to equip themselves to tackle the challenges in  our  country
brought about by our social and economic evolution.

We needed to bring water,  sanitation,  housing,  telecommunication,  health
facilities, free education, and infrastructure in general as  necessary  for
the development of our country. We did this as Parliament as we  voted  year
after year for the budgets of the government departments and in the  process
exercised oversight over the  spending  on  programmes  by  departments  and
ensured accountability through the committees of Parliament.

The fiscal and monetary policies, which were adopted by  Parliament  wherein
public representatives made substantial inputs, have ensured  that  we  have
the stability necessary to reach the comfort threshold of both domestic  and
foreign investors, to begin to have confidence  to  move  from  indirect  to
direct investment. Slowly we are beginning to see this  investment  reducing
the army of the unemployed and eroding  alienation  which  our  people  were
beginning to experience as a result of joblessness.

We have through our tax laws ensured the better collection of  revenue,  the
result of which is a radical reduction in our debt as a country, more  funds
to deliver basic services to our people and a  reduction  in  personal  tax.
The disposable income, which is a product of  that,  in  the  hands  of  our
people has had an effect of more savings, increased demands  for  goods  and
services and increased investments.

Our capacity derives from legislation and  the  institutions  that  we  have
created to fight all forms of crime, for example violent, white  collar  and
domestic violent crimes, have created an unprecedented climate of  stability
which has made our country  not  only  favourable  for  investment  but  the
tourist destination with the highest growth rate in the world.
A year ago, we were the only country in the world which had a  quantum  leap
growth of 21%. Our nine years of democracy has inspired the  world.  It  has
made it possible  that  within  the  framework  of  Nepad  we  are  able  to
intervene in countries like Burundi, the DRC  and  many  others  to  further
widen prospects of our own freedom and development.

Our adoption as Parliament of international protocols and  participation  in
international bodies has given leverage to our efforts as a country to  open
domestic markets in Africa and international markets to supply  domestically
produced goods and services  thus  giving  impetus  to  the  growth  of  our
economy.

The widening and deepening of our democracy need us to do more than  I  have
said. I believe that  as  a  people  who  have  participated  in  the  great
movement to bring about democracy, peace and justice, there is in no way  in
which we will be lulled to  sleep  by  some  of  the  achievements  we  have
registered based on the process of a Parliament which we engaged in.

We still need as Parliament to ensure that  the  spending  patterns  in  the
budgets of departments navigate further in their bias towards the poor,  the
rural and workers of this country. We still need  to  ensure  that  we  move
further in our affirmation of the previously  disadvantaged,  the  poor  and
women. We  still  need  to  further  ensure  manpower  planning  and  skills
development to ensure our country's competitiveness with  the  international
world. We still need to ensure as committees of Parliament  that  government
departments reach their targets as contained in their planning and budgets.

The greatest task still facing us is also  forging  unity  in  diversity  to
enable our people to experience freedom from  all  forms  of  discrimination
and to attain a common nationhood. The TRC has laid the foundation and  ours
is to further enhance this freedom through our day-to-day interactions.

As a province we have taken part to ensure that we  make  an  input  in  the
debate which is unfolding in our country. We  have  steadfastly  worked  for
the development of the province and  delivered  in  terms  of  the  delivery
objectives we have set ourselves.

We know that we have a hard and long road ahead of us, but  whilst  we  look
at the summits of the distant mountains  that  we  should  still  climb,  we
should be encouraged by the commitment of our people for the  broadening  of
the theatre of democracy and our determination  should  be  raised  when  we
look back at the lofty peaks we  have  conquered  as  Parliament  and  as  a
people. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chair, many South Africans might  argue  today  that
what significance does it hold in debating the nine years of democracy.  Let
me respond by quoting from an article in the Republican News in  Ireland  on
27 February 2003. The title read  as  follows,  and  I  quote:  ``Challenges
remain for the new South Africa":


  The enormity of the task facing the Government is far greater  than  many
  of us can imagine and the progress made to date cannot be scoffed at.
These are the views of Eoin O'Brion.

Based on his assessment, I would like to give my overview and assessment  on
our achievements and the challenges that remain in a  young  democracy  that
is less than a decade old. This Government led by  the  ANC  has  since  the
victory of democracy  in  1994,  made  reasonable  and  steady  progress  in
addressing the apartheid legacy of inequality  and  poverty.  This  enormous
challenge would not have been easily achieved and  transformed  had  it  not
been for the tremendous work done by  the  ANC  in  1955,  by  drafting  the
Freedom Charter, which today serves as  the  foundation  of  this  country's
strategy in achieving the ultimate goal in addressing the spotlight  of  the
poorest of the poor.

When the people of South Africa in their masses united in  1994,  they  gave
this Government, under the leadership of the  ANC,  the  mandate  to  ensure
that the following aspects, in terms of the Freedom  Charter,  be  realised:
Firstly, all national groups shall have equal  rights;  secondly,  the  land
shall be shared amongst those who work on  it;  thirdly,  the  people  shall
share in the country's wealth; fourthly, there shall be  work  and  security
and lastly, there shall be houses, security and comfort.

Today we salute remarkable  leaders,  amongst  others,  like  Oliver  Tambo,
Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu for their  endless  contributions,  sacrifices
and value  they  have  put  to  the  realising  of  these  noble  objectives
entrenched in the Freedom Charter. Long live the spirit of these  remarkable
leaders.

When we reflect on the first five years, which I want to  refer  to  as  the
receptive period, a period  of  unification,  reconciliation,  amending  and
strategic planning, and the period during which the eyes of  the  world  was
focused on a  liberation  force  to  prove  whether  they  can  conquer  the
challenges that a young democracy holds. Indeed, under the leadership of  an
outstanding leader like Mr Nelson Mandela, the Government could lay a  solid
foundation in realising change. It was during  this  period  that  we  could
ensure that concrete  programmes  could  be  developed  and  implemented  to
ensure the expanding of service delivery and eradicating the  socio-economic
disparities within the South African society, to sustain economic growth  in
a volatile global setting. We further worked as a united force  in  ensuring
that millions of our people have gained access to  services  of  which  they
were deprived prior to 1994.

Allow me to concentrate on some of the key  areas,  which  contributed  over
the past nine years to the eradication of poverty and addressing the  plight
of the poorest of the poor. When the ANC-led Government came to  power,  the
majority of our citizens were  deprived  of  decent  houses.  We  have  made
tremendous inroads in terms of this major task. Our  first  objective  as  a
Government, was to develop and adopt this country's first  housing  strategy
in December 1994. Since  then  housing  has  undergone  fundamental  change.
Today, we can proudly report that more than a million housing  opportunities
have been created, providing more than five  million  people  with  security
and safe homes. Not withholding  the  fact  that  resource  constraints  and
changing demographics necessitate more rigorous  focus  on  quality,  rather
than quantity-driven delivery.

In 2000, a new housing strategy was adopted, which focus  was  shifted  from
the 1994 strategy in terms of  quantity,  to  quality  to  ensure  equitable
access to  housing  opportunities  for  poor  and  previously  disadvantaged
persons. Hence the formulation of people's housing projects and  the  review
of the National Housing Subsidy  Programme.  Housing  is  now  part  of  the
integrated development planning.

Let me concentrate for a moment on a few  statistics  in  terms  of  housing
delivery. Being reminded of  the  huge  backlog  that  existed  due  to  our
apartheid legacy, between 1994 and 2000 more than 1 129 612 houses had  been
delivered or were  under  construction,  while  1  323  205  subsidies  were
allocated. Of these subsidies allocated since 1994, 5015 560 were  allocated
to female-headed households. By 2001, this Government had  spent  more  than
R14 billion to deliver a total of 1 167 435 houses  and  1  351  260  in  15
areas in all nine provinces in a human settlement programme.
Based on an integrated development plan of this country,  let  us  not  lose
sight of the fact that with  the  access  to  safe  housing,  we  have  also
provided these citizens with free basic services, access to  primary  health
care facilities, access to electricity, water and sanitation.

By highlighting our achievements, we do not say that  we  have  reached  our
objectives  completely.  Major  challenges  still  remain.  However,  as  we
continue through voluntarism, we will ensure that  the  people  continue  to
act as the builders of their own future. The  conditions  and  climate  have
been nurtured and are constant items on our  agenda.  We  will  continue  to
succeed if we identify the numbers of the elderly, children and people  with
disabilities who are entitled to social grants to  assist  them  in  gaining
access to these.

We also need to pay specific attention to  the  close  relationship  between
extreme poverty and particularly crime. This is based  on  the  increase  in
violence against women and children, that we ensure  that  the  campaign  of
safety and security be highlighted in the global context  of  our  programme
for reconstruction and development.

The effects of HIV/Aids is on the increase daily. It is and will remain  our
duty as responsible citizens of our young democracy, to spread  the  message
of support, abstaining, faithfulness, protection and general alert in  terms
of prevention and openness. It would stay the collective responsibility  and
not only a responsibility of the Government  of  the  day.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr K D S  DURR:  Mr  Chairman,  I  listened  to  my  colleagues  with  great
appreciation and understanding and agree with so much of what they say.  But
as a South African I am sometimes disappointed at the  lack  of  recognition
given by our colleagues to the massive contribution of  people  like  Mr  De
Klerk at the time, who made it possible.

In our country we could not have achieved what we achieved on our  own.  One
of the great things about South Africa, one of the great  things  about  our
future, is that we did so much together that we found each  other,  that  we
ennobled ourselves, that we rose above our  own  divisiveness  and  our  own
poor background, that we ennobled our country, that we  elevated  ourselves,
that we rose above our weakness. Great people like  Mr  Mandela,  Mr  Sisulu
and others and people like Mr De Klerk - if we do not honour  those  people,
we dishonour ourselves. We do not increase that which we have  achieved,  we
diminish what we have achieved. We elevate ourselves and our society  if  we
recognise what those people have done. I say that with great humility to  my
colleagues, Chairman.

Parliament is the custodian, along with the  Constitutional  Court,  of  our
constitutional rights and we are the curator of our Statute Book - the  laws
which govern our land. The rights, conventions and freedoms  we  enjoy  have
been fought hard for and have been passed  down  to  us  over  a  very  long
period and have become the inclusive property of all our citizens  over  the
past nine years in a peaceful transition.

It is here in Parliament that Government and society must  give  account  of
themselves through their political parties and where we  can  be  called  to
account. If we were in a European company, in Public company terms we  would
be the supervisory board, the Cabinet would  be  the  executive  board,  our
citizens the stakeholders and  we  need  to  manage  the  country  in  their
interests. They are also the voters and the ultimate arbitrators as  to  who
should act as custodians in our Parliament  of  the  national  interest  and
their interests.

It  is  vital  that  our  actions  in  Parliament   should   benefit   these
stakeholders and that they should see long-term growth  and  the  fulfilment
of their reasonable aspirations on a sustainable basis, and that  Parliament
should  balance  the  competing  interests  of  society  and  the  long-term
interest of our country and all its people.

I can just say that what made me proud today in this Parliament was  when  I
heard that it was a combined effort from the ANC and the New  NP  that  they
have returned honourable  colleagues  like  Mr  Matthee  and  Mr  Adams  ...
[Interjections.] No, honestly, it is an enormous sign  of  the  maturity  of
our society. It need not have been, but it was and  it  is  a  sign  of  the
growing maturity of this Parliament. It is a sign  of  strength  and  I  was
really most impressed. Because apart from the fact that we did not  want  to
lose such eminent members, it was a sign of maturity and  greatness  on  the
part of the ANC and I really appreciate it.

Today,  as  with  international  business,   few,   if   any   international
governments can escape the consequences of governing  badly.  The  state  of
the nation is the litmus test of the effectiveness of Parliament.  There  is
a direct linkage between good government and the rising standards  of  life.
Good government and good parliamentary institutions functioning  effectively
and  fairly  on  a  nonintrusive  basis  in  society  are  the  hallmark  of
successful countries. Corruption and deviant behaviour are illnesses in  the
body politic that hinder and even ultimately waste a  society,  as  we  have
seen so often worldwide and on our continent.

Governments and parliaments cannot hide anymore, because with the  click  of
a mouse almost all is  revealed  instantly  and  worldwide  to  the  trained
observer and consumer and there is no place to hide. When one governs  well,
the markets reward one; when one governs badly the markets cane  one.  There
is no escape.

The world will invest in a country only if they  trust  its  government  and
its institutions. The greater the trust, the bigger will  be  the  long-term
investment. [Time expired.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, each and every one of us as representatives  of
the people of the provinces of South Africa must do our  best  to  heal  the
divisions of the past and establish a society based  on  democratic  values,
social justice and fundamental human rights. We must do our best to  promote
a democratic and open society in which government is based on  the  will  of
the people and every citizen is equally protected by law.  We  must  do  our
best to improve the quality of  life  of  all  our  citizens  and  free  the
potential of each and every South African. We must do our best  to  build  a
united and democratic South Africa able to take  its  rightful  place  as  a
sovereign state in the family of nations.

It is expected from each and  every  one  of  us  in  the  preamble  to  our
Constitution and this must be the aim and the goal  of  any  development  in
South Africa. This is not only a  distinct  vision  or  theoretical  vision.
This is the test that we as parliamentarians  must  submit  ourselves,  this
House and our parties  to,  so  as  to  establish  whether  or  not  we  are
effectively promoting real development in South Africa as envisaged  in  our
Constitution or whether some of us are not  actually  working  against  such
development.

Voorsitter, wanneer ons terugkyk oor nege jaar van demokrasie  en  spesifiek
waar ons op daardie tydstip was, nie net as Parlement nie  maar  ook  as  'n
nasie, dan kan ons terselfdertyd met nederigheid trots en dankbaar wees  oor
wat ons reeds bereik het. Ten spyte van skeptici in die  buiteland  en  hier
te lande, wat 'n klaaglike mislukking voorspel het, en steeds  voortgaan  om
dit  te  doen,  het  ons  daarin  geslaag  om  ons  demokratiese  bestel  te
konsolideer en 'n kultuur van menseregte te vestig wat die  karakter  geword
het van ons sisteem van regering en ons hele gemeenskap. Ons  word  bemoedig
deur die  voortuitgang  wat  daar  reeds  gemaak  is  ten  opsigte  van  die
uitwissing van armoede en ontwikkeling en die ras-, geslag-  en  geografiese
wanbalanse van die verlede. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, when we look back on nine years of democracy and  specifically
where we were at that point in time, not only as Parliament, but also  as  a
nation, then we can at the same time be proud and humbly thankful  for  what
we have already achieved. In spite of sceptics abroad and in  this  country,
who predicted a dismal failure and still continue to do so, we have  managed
to consolidate our democratic dispensation and to  establish  a  culture  of
human rights that became the character of our system of government  and  our
whole community. We are heartened by the  progress  that  has  already  been
made with regard to the eradication of poverty, development and the  racial,
gender and geographical imbalances of the past.]

We just have to look at Chapter 3 of our  latest  Yearbook  for  2002-03  in
which an overview is given of the enormous progress that  has  already  been
made. I will just mention one, namely the Community Water Supply  Programme,
which by April 2002 had brought access to clean  water  to  over  7  million
mainly rural people who previously had no access. At  the  current  rate  of
spending the infrastructure backlog for basic water  supply  will  be  wiped
out by 2008 and sanitation by  2010,  thereby  matching  the  UN  Millennium
Declaration target of reducing the  proportion  of  the  world's  population
without access to water and sanitation by 50% by 2015.

The pace of delivery of this programme was internationally  recognised  when
this programme was chosen as the best programme  at  the  Globe  Awards  for
sustainable development in water. Like other developing  countries  we  are,
however, still faced with huge social  obstacles  and  economic  challenges.
The unacceptably high crime levels, an  unemployment  rate  of  around  40%,
HIV/Aids, TB and malaria infection  levels  threaten  to  swamp  our  health
resources and the terrible poverty among so many of our people.

To achieve the vision as set out in the Constitution and  to  enable  us  to
effectively address the enormous challenges of our country,  we  do  not  at
this stage in  our  lives  in  this  country  need  a  more  aggressive  and
confrontational political opposition.  What  we  need  is  MPs  and  parties
committed to the building of  a  better  and  a  more  effective  government
focused on delivery, who will present  their  perspectives,  criticisms  and
solutions in a constructive and positive manner in the political centre  and
in such a way that it includes and unites every South African  community  in
our shared South African patriotism.

The rationale behind our House is on the one hand to  ensure  that  national
legislation or policy responds to provincial interests,  and  on  the  other
hand, to ensure that provinces are integrated into the national  legislative
process and that proper delivery does in fact take place at  provincial  and
local levels. The proper and effective utilisation of the oversight role  of
the NCOP is essential for the improvement of delivery to our  people.  There
is the wrong impression among some sections of  the  public  that  oversight
is, in the first place, a function of the opposition. We must at  all  times
demonstrate to the public that this is a fallacy.

The  NCOP  is  a  functioning  partnership  among  the  three   spheres   of
Government, namely national, provincial and local  which  has  a  tremendous
task to ensure that there is proper delivery to our people. When we look  at
the challenges ahead of us, I also want to refer members  to  two  lines  in
our Constitution. In the preamble, which  we  often  overlook,  we  see  the
goals and visions set out for us; after that - and this is so often  ignored
- it says: We also pray that God may protect our people.  And  this  is  the
only place where it stands like this in all the languages and it also  says:
God bless South Africa.

Voorsitter, ek wil ook van hierdie geleentheid  gebruik  maak  om  almal  te
bedank, beide in my party en in die ANC waarna die agb Durr verwys het,  wat
dit moontlik gemaak het vir my en  my  kollega  van  die  Wes-Kaap,  Freddie
Adams, om terug te keer na hierdie Huis, om steeds te probeer om dié rol  te
vervul wat ons Grondwet so duidelik vir ons uitspel. Ek wil die  onderneming
in my persoonlike hoedanigheid gee, nie aan enige  persoon  of  enige  party
nie, maar aan my volksgenote en in getrouheid ook aan hierdie Grondwet,  dat
ek te alle tye sal poog om die  visie  wat  hierin  uitgespel  word,  na  te
streef met al  die  krag  tot  my  beskikking.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I also want to take this opportunity to thank everyone, in  my
party as well as in the ANC to which the hon  Durr  referred,  who  made  it
possible for my colleague and I from  the  Western  Cape  Freddie  Adams  to
return to this House to keep trying to play this role that our  Constitution
outlines so clearly for  us.  I  want  to  give  the  assurance  in  my  own
capacity, not to any person or any party, but to  my  compatriots  and  also
with loyalty to this Constitution, that I will at  all  times  endeavour  to
follow the vision that has been outlined herein  with  all  the  strength  I
have at my disposal. [Applause.]]

Nksz N C PHENDUKA  (Ntshona  Koloni):  Sekela  Sihlalo,  mandizeke  mzekweni
kwabathe  bathetha  ngaphambili.  Mandiqale  ndithabathe  eli  thuba  ndithi
''Halala'' kuSihlalo weBhunga leSizwe lamaPhondo  ngokuthi  uMzantsi  Afrika

kwizifungo zakhe zokwakha nokukhokela le Ndlu  ngokungena  mkhethe,  asoloko
esenjenjalo ukuba lithandazwe. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Ms N C PHENDUKA (Western Cape): Deputy Chair,  let  me  follow  suit,  like
others  who  spoke  before  me.  Let  me  first  take  this  opportunity  to
congratulate the Chairperson of the NCOP for having  been  found,  by  South
Africans, to be still suitable to lead this House. May she hold  on  to  her
pledge to build and lead this House with impartiality, may she  continue  to
be a patriot.]
As we begin the last month of the first decade of freedom we need to  remind
ourselves that our strategic goal is still  the  transformation  of  society
and reconstruction and development of our  country.  The  historic  day,  27
April 1994, was in some respect a new era to usher  us  to  a  more  complex
development scenario.

The  new  Constitution  guarantees  equal  rights  to  all  South  Africans,
including those who benefited from the governing  structures  of  apartheid.
We have witnessed the rapid change that has taken  place  in  South  Africa,
such as parliamentary and presidential elections,  a  process  that  gave  a
chance to the people of South Africa  to  vote.  It  gave  rise  to  a  new,
nonsexist,  nonracial  and  democratic  Constitution  which  recognised  the
rights of people in the community to determine their own future.

It is also  committed  to  organisational  and  individual  development  and
working in partnerships.  This  Government  has  a  partnership  with  civil
society. Development agencies are  part  of  the  Government.  It  seeks  to
address the legacy of the past, particularly  poverty,  and  decreasing  the
gap between the rich and the poor in South Africa.

Black economic empowerment is meant to correct social imbalances and  create
jobs within the context of fiscal and monetary  discipline.  These  and  the
consolidation  of  democratic  processes  remain  the  main  aim   of   this
Government's economic policies.

Kule minyaka ilithoba idlulileyo  zininzi  iinguqu  ezenziwe  buburhulumente
ukuhlangabezana neengxaki zabantu abahluphekileyo: Kunyuswe iimali  zendodla
zabadala,  ezabantwana  abakhubazekileyo  nezabantwana  abagcinwe   emakhaya
ngeenxa  yeemeko  ezahlukeneyo.   Ngokunjalo,   kuye   kwanikwa   amalungelo
amakhosikazi ebekade engenalizwi kwimithetho  yeli  lizwe.  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[There are many changes that have been brought about by  the  Government  in
the past nine years to address the problems  of  the  poor:  Welfare  grants
have been increased, and that of  disabled  children  as  well  as  that  of
children living with foster parents. In  the  same  manner  women,  who  all
along had no voice in the making of the laws  of  this  country,  were  also
given rights.]

We have a Government that is accountable to all the people of South  Africa,
is efficient and has done a fair amount of work for the  citizens.  We  have
witnessed the establishment of many institutions, such as the  Human  Rights
Commission, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as the  passing
of laws that bring about stability in people's lives in  the  labour  market
and the public service, including skills development,  such  as  the  Equity
Act. All these set up appropriate  measures  to  address  the  disadvantaged
position of black people, particularly women in the workplace.

The enormous disparities that have been existing between  black  and  white,
rich and poor, will not be removed by the miracle of  a  new  South  Africa,
and neither will the  relationship  between  black  and  white  citizens  be
improved by such. We know that our rainbow nation is not quite as  shiny  as
we might want  it  to  be.  There  are  still  pockets  of  racism  in  many
provinces. We all need to work towards eradicating racism in our country.

There are challenges that do not face the President or  Ministers  only,  as
many would believe. We must all work to meet each other halfway and at  last
march on the same line. We need to  intensify  our  communication  with  the
public and encourage more participation by the civil  society  in  deepening
democracy.

Lastly, I want to dedicate this day to the heroes of South  Africa  and  the
people that have contributed to what we are today and to  what  the  country
is today, that is Comrade Mandela, Comrade Sisulu and  the  colleagues  that
have been working in this country.

We want to dedicate this day to the President of this country who  has  been
in and out of this country setting the pace not only for South  Africa,  but
also for Africa,  in  a  very  meaningful  way,  for  building  this  lovely
country. Left and right, those who think that this country is not  going  to
make it and succeed in future are  actually  shooting  themselves  down.  We
hope that this country, at the end of the decade,  will  achieve  everything
and that everybody will live in harmony and  in  prosperity.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chairperson, I must take this opportunity and echo  the  words
of hon Mr Durr - I see that he has just left - when he spoke about the  kind
of arrangements we ourselves have made as a movement of our people in  terms
of ensuring that indeed we are able to retain members of the  New  NP  owing
to  the  kind  of  changes  which  were  occasioned  by  the  floor-crossing
legislation. That does in fact bear a cogent testimony to  the  high  levels
of political maturity on the part of this glorious movement of  our  people,
the ANC. I felt that I needed to echo the words of the hon Mr Durr.  I  want
to say that indeed this is a correct path that we have chosen as the ANC  in
pursuit of our strategic objective of building one nation and  building  one
country and to ensure that indeed, there is thoroughgoing transformation  of
our society at all its levels.

But I will be failing this very glorious movement of our  people  if  I  did
not consciously and  deliberately  respond  to  the  kind  of  untruths  and
distortions by the hon member Sono from the DA when she made  the  following
remarks. Of course, one is that she alludes to the fact that indeed  as  the
ANC, who gave them the freedom to speak in the  manner  in  which  they  are
speaking this afternoon, we gave the majority of our people in this  country
access to basic services. These are achievements that are out there for  all
to see. But she goes further, albeit in a very naive sense,  and  makes  the
point that South Africa is where it is today precisely because -  I  do  not
know where she got this from - we do not have a national economic  strategy,
which in my view is nothing but sheer political myopia of  the  worst  kind.
[Laughter.] I say this with all due respect, because she is the same age  as
my late mother, and I do not want to take her reputation.

The basis of these untruths she has said in this Chamber to the cleaners.  I
would not do that myself, for the ANC is far too  decent  to  stoop  to  the
level of the political gutter, in the manner that she has  stooped  in  this
Chamber this afternoon.

The one salient point that I want to make in this Chamber this afternoon  is
that, as the ANC, part of our broad macro-economic  strategy  reaffirms  the
kind of macroeconomic reforms we need in this country  that  are  designated
to further sparing our economy to a level where we  can  achieve  our  broad
social and economic objectives. The creation and strengthening of a  vibrant
SMME sector are part of these macroeconomic reforms. What is  the  hon  Sono
talking about? Because, if anything, if the truth be told, this  is  clearly
what  I  would  call  utter   hogwash.   I   must   admit   ...   [Laughter]
[Interjections] ... it is actually errant twaddle. It  is  sheer  balderdash
of the worst kind. Some of these hon members, honestly,  have  created  some
kind of special political island for themselves. As cadres of  the  ANC  who
are  free,  who  are  available  to  dish  out  free  economic  lessons  ...
[Interjections]  ...  not   on   macroeconomics,   on   microeconomics   ...
[Interjections.] Ordinary South Africans ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  Please,  hon  members  on  the
floor, I do not expect a second meeting there.

Mr T B TAABE: Hon Chairperson, ordinary  South  Africans,  the  majority  of
whom were oppressed for many decades by draconian apartheid legislation  and
on whose behalf I speak as a cadre of the glorious army of our  people,  the
ANC this afternoon, would confirm that when they voted for us  on  27  April
1994, for our freedom to be complete we needed  to  act  together  fully  to
transform our country to a nonracial, nonsexist, democratic  and  prosperous
nation and that they would continue to be part of the ongoing  struggle  for
total change.

Equally, as the ANC we pledged that we would use  all  institutions  at  our
disposal, including this Parliament, necessarily and principally  to  engage
in a struggle for total transformation. Our people ought to be saluted  this
afternoon, because nine  years  into  our  democracy,  even  when  at  times
challenges relating to the legacy of the past seem to delay our march  to  a
better tomorrow, they steadfastly refused to be lied to and discouraged  hon
Sono because, however rough and bumpy the  road  will  be,  their  eyes  and
minds are firmly fixed on the destination we defined together. [Applause.]

This is understood up to this very date, for this  destination  was  defined
when  our  people,  through  their  movement,  the  ANC,  met  in  Kliptown,
Johannesburg, in 1955, and concluded the Freedom Charter with the  following
words:


  These freedoms we will fight for side by side, throughout our lives until
  we have won our liberty.

In the course of  our  struggle  we  emerged  as  the  ANC,  the  liberation
movement that waged a bitter  and  resolute  struggle  against  the  morally
repugnant and evil system of apartheid. Our people continue to give  us  the
mandate to lead the new democratic system and to  reconstruct,  develop  and
transform the  country  and  further  to  transform  and  create  a  vibrant
political and economic system, thereby bringing  about  improvement  in  the
lives of millions of our  people  across  the  length  and  breadth  of  our
country.

This is the mandate we will carry resolutely and with  sheer  determination.
What practically was done we did ourselves as the movement of our people  to
realise these objectives. I think that is the question we should  be  posing
this afternoon. But it  is  equally  disheartening  to  hear  one  of  these
leaders in this  country,  leading  their  usual  double-faced  and  double-
tongued Micky Mouse flock, some of whom are represented in this  Parliament,
make a bold, albeit myopic assertion in Parliament that  the  South  African
reality is that for millions of our fellow citizens life is  no  better  now
than it was in 1994. And that for many people, in spite of  their  political
freedom, life is actually ... worse. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo [Hon Chairperson], it is indeed  a
great honour and privilege for me to be afforded the opportunity to  address
the House on this topic. We have  many  things  for  which  we  need  to  be
grateful in the new democratic dispensation in South Africa. The  transition
from apartheid  to  democracy  has  been  internationally  celebrated  as  a
political miracle, and the country's truth and  reconciliation  process  has
been wide ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Sorry, mama  Vilakazi,
there is a member who wants to make a point of order. What is your point  of
order, Mr Raju?

Mr N M RAJU: The point of order, Hon Chair, is whether it  is  parliamentary
to be reading a newspaper while  a  colleague  of  mine  is  addressing  the
House.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Please continue,  mama
Vilakazi.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: South Africa  has  not  been  without  its  own  share  of
problems. Oh, I am sorry, I have been disturbed. Postapartheid South  Africa
has not been without its own share  of  problems.  No  turnaround  could  be
expected within just nine years. The new Government  inherited  a  shattered
economy, unemployment and social dislocation with  its  attendant  problems,
such as drug abuse, gangsterism and widespread poverty. The major  challenge
facing us at this juncture in the history of our new democracy  is  that  of
securing economic justice for the  vast  majority  of  our  people  who  are
living in poverty. Despite nine years of democratic rule,  there  are  still
vast inequalities of wealth in our country.

On the other hand,  the  most  vulnerable  of  our  society,  in  particular
children, older persons, people with disabilities and people  infected  with
and affected by HIV/Aids and other diseases, are more than ever before.  The
Government has, over the years, intensified its responses  to  reducing  the
pain and ongoing suffering of  our  people,  especially  older  persons  and
people with disabilities during the processing and payment of grants.

I would like to say that progress  has  been  made  in  the  poverty  relief
programme. It is one of the programmes that places the  poor  themselves  at
the centre of development, whilst attempting to increase their  asset  base.
This takes place in the context  in  which  the  majority  of  projects  are
located in rural areas, in which there are high  levels  of  illiteracy  and
malnutrition, and in which access to services is  severely  inadequate.  The
challenges  confronting  the  projects  themselves   may   require   greater
flexibility in our financing and development policies.

Sihlalo  ohloniphekileyo  neNdlu  yonke,  kule  minyaka  eyisishiyagalolunye
ukuphatha  kwabamnyama  eNingizimu  Afrika,   kulethe   inkululeko   kithina
ebesicindezelwe iminyaka ngabamhlophe. Khona nje ukuthi  ngikhuluma  ngolimi

ezindlini, amanzi  ahlanzekileyo  eyayingeke  iwathole  kuleya  ngcindezelo.
Abesifazane  babambe  iqhaza  elikhulu  ezikhundleni   eziphezulu,   nokunye

Kodwa  nakhu  okuseyiva  enyameni,  okokuqala  ukucwasa  ngebala  kusekhona.
Akuqedwe nya!  Otholakala  ecwasa  ngebala  makajeziswe  kanzima  angaphinde

Okwesine,  ubugebengu  nobudlova   busathe   bhe!   Okwesihlanu,   uHulumeni

Akunciphe izinkulumo ezingathi shu! Makwande umsebenzi oncomekayo  e-Afrika.
Sesikhuluma ulimi olusha manje lweNepad,  lwe-AU  nolwe-African  Parliament.
Nazo izithelo ezinhle  ezidingekayo  ukwandisa  umnotho  nokuzwana  e-Afrika
jikelele.  Egameni  leNkatha  Freedom  Party,  sithi  phambili  ngemisebenzi
emihle,  phansi  ngobubi!  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[Hon  Chairperson  and  the  House,  in  the  past  nine  years  the   black
administration has brought freedom to us who, for years, were  oppressed  by
whites in South Africa. Even the fact  that  I  speak  in  my  own  language
indicates an achievement. There has  been  an  increase  in  the  number  of
families who use electricity in their homes which they would never have  had
during the term of the white  oppressive  regime.  Many  families  now  have
clean running water which they would  never  have  had  in  that  oppressive
environment. Women occupy high positions, etc.

However, firstly, the fact that discrimination on the basis of colour  still
prevails is a pain in the neck. It must be completely eradicated!  A  person
who is found to be discriminating against others  on  the  basis  of  colour
should be given a stiff penalty so that they  would  never  do  that  again.
Secondly, jobs are scarce. We black people live in abject poverty.  Thirdly,
our children who attend the former Model C schools  are  really  unhappy.  I
appeal to the Department of Education to pull up its socks and address  this
matter. Affirmative action is not functioning properly  in  those  education
centres. The school governing bodies are still exclusively made up of  white
people. It is only one or two black  people  who  are  co-opted  into  those
structures. Things are still not fine at all there.

Fourthly, the levels of violence and criminal activity are still very  high.
Fifthly, we appeal to the Government to help us by resolving  the  issue  of
traditional leadership. In these  nine  years  there  should  have  been  an
increase in respect and helping one another, co-operation  and  not  looking
down upon others. Let us  do  away  with  useless  talk.  Let  there  be  an
increase of commendable actions in Africa. We now speak a  new  language  of
Nepad, AU and African parliament. Those are the fruits that  are  needed  to
increase the wealth and co-existence in the whole of Africa.  On  behalf  of
the IFP, we would like to say: Forward with  good  deeds!  Down  with  nasty
acts! [Applause.]]

The  CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Thank  you  very   much,   Chairperson.
Chairperson, it is indeed a privilege to  be  speaking  after  Mrs  Vilakazi
because she clearly illustrates that the challenge  that  we  face  in  this
country is not to polarise ourselves, but to work together towards a  common
objective that we've all agreed to when we developed  the  Constitution.  In
fact it is what Mr Matthee referred to as his vision statement.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, please!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Chairperson,  Cyril
Ramaphosa referred to the Constitution as  the  birth  certificate  of  this
democratic nation. Indeed it is so. It is in this Constitution that we  have
the values of human dignity, freedom and equality  imbued.  In  fact  as  we
look at the past nine years, as we reflect on these past nine years,  it  is
important to note that the single greatest achievement  of  this  Parliament
here has been the adoption of a Constitution  that  was  supported  by  most
political parties, if not all.

This was the result of two years of intensive negotiations and hard work  in
terms whereof  this  nation  through  its  public  representatives  achieved
consensus. The  Constitution  itself  incorporates  a  fundamental  Bill  of
Rights which can be regarded as the most modern charter of  rights  in  this
world.  In  no  other  constitution  in  the  world  you  have  a  right  to
administrative justice. In no other constitution in the world  do  you  have
the right to information. In no other constitution in this  world  does  the
right to equality apply horizontally.

In this Constitution of ours we stated, and that's part of  our  vision  and
our mission, that it is not enough  for  us  to  have  civil  and  political
liberties such as freedom of expression  and  freedom  of  movement  without
addressing the other freedoms: the freedom from  hunger,  the  freedom  from
being without shelter. And therefore we again in our Constitution,  much  to
the original reluctance of the Democratic Party - Mr Leon  in  fact  opposed
it originally, but was subsequently convinced and persuaded that  we  should
- in fact have a bill of rights which  incorporates  socio-economic  rights.
We now have a right to housing, we have a right to food, we have a right  to
the environment - third-generation rights. These are  wonderful,  formidable
achievements.

Our Constitution also sets out the framework in terms  whereof  there  is  a
separation of powers. We can say  in  the  past  nine  years  that  we  have
respected Government and Parliament. The ANC has respected the  independence
of the judiciary. It has not interfered with nor has it  intervened  in  the
process of the judiciary. I think that is a remarkable achievement.

So as we look back into our nine years we must  reflect  very  carefully  on
these achievements. The framework which  incorporates  the  vision  and  the
ideology belongs not to the African National Congress, not to the  IFP,  not
to the New National Party, but to this nation as a whole. And  it  is  those
political parties who have slept through a social and political  revolution,
as we referred to it, like Rip van  Winkels  who  are  unable  to  recognise
these realities.

It is those political  parties  who  would  say  that  yes,  fine  you  have
delivered electricity to millions of our people in the  hinterland,  in  the
far rural areas, but you have paid insufficient attention to  these  details
here. The fact is either they are fast asleep,  sleeping  through  a  social
and political revolution, or alternatively their  eyes  are  open  but  they
refuse to see.

Now  I  understand  the  difficulties,   Chairperson.   I   understand   the
difficulties of a person who has  come  from  a  historically  disadvantaged
community who sees delivery taking place to the poorest  of  the  poor,  who
sees improvements in the quality of the lives of  our  people,  particularly
the poorest of the poor, who recognises those realities and achievements  as
has been clearly established by Mrs Vilakazi. But  because  of  his  or  her
association to a political party that seeks to  polarise  our  society  they
refuse or are unable to articulate the achievements of this  democracy.  And
I think it is important that such persons really address  and  look  at  the
realities of life.

What Mr Matthee is saying and what Mr Durr is  saying  is  that  the  single
greatest achievement of this Parliament and this democracy is that  we  have
built  this  nation  together.  Our  commitment   to   nation-building   and
reconciliation has been a collective  commitment  across  the  colour  line,
across all creeds and across all religious  persuasions.  And  that  is  the
reality we have to recognise.

But we must also  recognise  what  Mrs  Vilakazi  is  saying  and  that  our
Constitution enjoins us  as  legislators  to  ensure  that  we  redress  the
inequalities of the past, that we  transform  institutions  that  are  still
racially composed, that we  ensure  that  there  is  representation  in  our
schools,  and  that  there  is  representation  in  all  institutions  which
represent our democracy. And  it  is  for  that  very  reason  that  in  our
Constitution we provided the pillars that support our democracy,  Chapter  9
institutions. The Gender  Commission  is  there  to  ensure  that  there  is
empowerment of our women who have been disadvantaged and prejudiced  for  so
long and live on the periphery of society.

This Parliament and this House, is evidence of the fact that we do  in  fact
have a representative nation,  reflected  in  its  composition  through  our
women and our men who are present here. And  unless  and  until  we  embrace
that reality we are going to have difficulty in moving forward.  But  it  is
heartening to hear, that Mrs Vilakazi's, who comes from  a  political  party
other than the African National Congress, appeal is the same as  the  ANC's.
Mr Matthee's appeal is the same as the ANC's. Mr Durr's appeal is  the  same
as the ANC's. So we can say as we stand here, without any reservation,  that
the ANC is moving in a way that addresses the  concerns,  the  visions,  the
hopes and the expectations of this nation as a whole.

I do not believe that  it  is  the  intention,  certainly  I  can  say  that
categorically, of the African  National  Congress,  nor  of  Government  and
certainly not of Parliament to suppress the voice  of  other  people.  I  do
believe and I recognise that we have challenges. But as we were  engaged  in
setting  out  a  constitutional  framework  and  ensuring  that  we   repeal
repressive legislation and transforming the nature of the  legislation  that
is going to regulate our lives, we are also  faced  with  the  challenge  of
ensuring that we accelerate  delivery,  particularly  to  the  rural  areas,
particularly to the poorest of the poor,  and  change  the  quality  of  the
lives of our people.

We have to push back the frontiers of poverty. It is  a  commitment  by  the
ANC, and this commitment is reflected in its policies. It has  the  soundest
economic  policies.  Our  currency  has  performed  the  best  amongst   all
currencies, Mr Sono, in the world against the basket of  currencies.  It  is
because we have stable, firm economic policies.

We have a budget that  is  transparent.  We  have  a  budget  that  provides
information and it goes beyond its  legal  requirements  and  constitutional
requirements. It provides you, the Treasury does this, with the  medium-term
expenditure budget framework. It provides  you  with  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review. It provides you with information that you could  examine  and
utilise in a meaningful  way  in  your  oversight  work.  And  that  is  the
responsibility  of  our  Parliament.  And  I  believe  as  we  look  at  our
Parliament we must say that we  have  passed  through  this  Parliament,  as
lawmakers, very, very important transformatory legislation which enables  us
as parliamentarians to use it as effective tools to  ensure  that  there  is
effective delivery and that there is transformation  in  the  lives  of  our
people. That is the reality that we must embrace. That is the  reality  that
we must recognise as we move forward to say that, whilst we  recognise  that
we are all equal before the law, certainly  in  socio-economic  terms  there
are too many inequalities that we have inherited which we have  to  redress.
And we have to do so in a meaningful way.

We have to admit that we have to transform the judiciary, that it has to  be
more credible and more legitimate. We have to admit  that  our  economy,  in
terms of its management, has to be transformed. We have to admit that  black
economic empowerment is a necessary  instrument  for  transformation.  These
are important policies to move our country forward so that it  becomes  more
representative and it becomes a nation which has now moved forward in  terms
of  redressing  the  inequalities   of   the   past   and   fulfilling   its
constitutional mandate.

Chairperson, I think as we are sitting out here, in general terms, we  could
say with great sincerity, and I think with conviction that we  have  through
this institution, and the  National  Council  of  Provinces  in  particular,
established nation-building, established a consensus in terms of our  vision
and our objectives in terms of  the  work  we  do.  We  can  also  say  with
conviction that we have recognised our responsibilities in  doing  effective
oversight work, and that we are looking at the  areas  our  President  spoke
about  and  that  is  integrated  sustainable  rural  development.  That  is
precisely what you are referring to. Our Minister  of  Economic  Affairs  is
talking precisely about developing  your  micros.  This  is  what  has  been
raised. So these are policy issues. But if you are unaware of  the  policies
of this Government then you have this difficulty.

Chairperson, may I conclude by saying that we should also  be  grateful  for
the fact that we have the leadership that we have in this  institution.  And
it is quite interesting that the Deputy Chairperson, the Chairperson of  the
NCOP and myself were quite part and parcel  of  this  very,  very  important
deliberative  instrument  which  sets  out  our  mission  and  vision,   the
Constitution, the supreme  law  of  our  land.  I  thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

                          GEOSCIENCE AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Economic and
                          Foreign Affairs thereon)

Mr B J  TOLO:  Chair  and  hon  members,  thank  you  very  much.  Now,  the
Geoscience Amendment Bill is a small amending Bill  which  seeks  to  effect
the lawful transfer of movable and immovable property  from  the  Department
of Minerals and Energy to the Council for Geoscience.

Now, when the Geoscience Act which established the  geoscience  council  was
passed in 1993, the property which was to be transferred to the Council  for
Geoscience was not transferred. That property was  to  be  devolved  to  the
council when that law came into operation.  But  unfortunately  as  I  said,
that did not take place. The state law advisers have actually  advised  that
you cannot all of a sudden now,  because  you  have  not  done  it  at  that
particular time, just transfer it because there was a lapse of time.

Now they have then suggested that there is a need for a small  amendment  so
that that anomaly can actually be corrected. Now the  Bill  therefore  is  a
small technical  amendment,  which  provides  for  the  devolution  of  that
property to the council.

Now I must say that the select committee looked at the Bill and agreed  that
we are going to ask this House to pass the Bill as it stands. I thank you.

             APPOINTEES TO BOARD OF SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL PARKS

   (Consideration of Report of Select Committee on Land and Environmental
                                  Affairs)

Rev P MOATSHE:  Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  allow  me  to  make  a
statement on the appointment of members to the South African National  Parks
Board. SANParks is the custodian of the nation's biological diversity and  a
major player in the national tourism sector.

Parks under  its  management  include  such  icons  as  the  Cape  Peninsula
National Park, a veritable centre of endemism with its rich  Cape  floristic
kingdom. There is the marine and coastal Tsitsikama National Park, with  its
indigenous forest; the arid Kgalagadi  Transfrontier  Park  and  its  desert
micro-creatures and  the  Kruger  National  Park,  world  renowned  for  its
diversity of mammals and richness of bird life. This is  to  mention  but  a
few.

In keeping with the national development agenda, SANParks has increased  its
participation in programmmes aimed at socioeconomic and cultural  upliftment
of historically deprived populations, in particular  those  living  adjacent
to the national parks. A key role-player in the  transfrontier  conservation
initiatives,  SANParks  is  involved  together  with  several   other   SADC
conservation organizations in bio-diversity  management,  tourism  promotion
and  community  development  within  the  Southern   African   region.   The
leadership provided by  the  board  will  play  an  important  role  in  the
archievement of all of this. Moreover, the board has  the  crucial  task  of
transferring power and control of resources from the minority that had  been
appointed and privileged by an undemocratic system,  to  the  majority  that
participates in the new democratic process.

Having considered the nominations for the new  members  of  the  board,  the
select committee has no doubt that their  appointment  will  strengthen  the
South African National Parks and will further contribute  towards  directing
the benefits of South Africa's National Parks to  providing  for  all  South
Africans, rather than the more wealthy and privileged sections  of  society.
We welcome the appointments by the Minister  and  look  forward  to  working
with the new members of the board. We thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate. I shall now put the question. The question is  that  the  report  be
adopted. As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether delegation heads are  present.
I think they are all present.

In accordance with Rule 71 I shall first allow provinces the opportunity  to
make declarations of vote, if they so wish. We  shall  now  proceed  to  the
voting on the question. I shall do this in alphabetical order per  province.
Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they  vote  in
favour or against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Siyayamkela. [We welcome it.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Free State?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: North West in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Western Cape?

Ms N C PHENDUKA: Western Cape in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you.  All
provinces have voted in favour. I  therefore  declare  the  report  adopted.
[Applause.] That concludes the business of the day.

The Council adjourned at 16:59.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The progress Report on the Appointment of the  Inspector  General  for
     Intelligence:


         The Inspector General for Intelligence Services, Dr MF Randera  was
         appointed by the President on 1st May 2000.  As  mentioned  in  our
         previous annual  report,  the  Inspector  General  resigned  on  27
         February 2002, for private  and  personal  reasons.  The  President
         accepted his resignation  and  requested  parliament,  through  the
         Speaker  to  initiate  the  process  of  replacing  the   Inspector
         General. The Speaker referred this task to the JSCI.


         The committee met with the Ministry for Intelligence  Services  and
         agreed on the need to appoint the critical staff under the CEO  and
         finalise the administrative regulations. There was also  a  process
         of  legislative  amendments  which   was   already   entering   the
         parliamentary process. The CEO asked for a period  of  six  months,
         up to  the  end  of  October  to  finalise  these  regulations  and
         appointments.


         In November  2002,  JSCI  advertised  for  the  post  allowing  two
         months, up to the end of January  2003,  for  nominations  for  the
         post. Adverts were placed in national and regional newspapers.  The
         committee met in February 2003 to consider  the  applications.  The
         Committee  unanimously  agreed  that  we  did  not  attract  enough
         suitable  candidates  for  this  important  post.   Most   of   the
         applicants   were   Junior   Police   Officers    and    unemployed
         matriculants. This left the Committee unable to  shortlist  any  of
         the candidates.


         The Committee decided to embark on the processes which will  inform
         parliament  and  the  South  African  public  about   the   nature,
         responsibility and requirements of the post.
         The IG is one of the administrative oversight mechanisms  over  our
         intelligence structures. The main functions amongst others are:


              1.  to monitor compliance of services  with  the  constitution
                 and the operational policies.
              2.  to review operational activities of the Services.
              3.  to receive and process complaints from the members of  the
                 public on the violation of policies by the Services.


         Once the IG is appointed he must take an oath of  secrecy  under  a
         judge. He/she functions within the intelligence  community  but  is
         independent in his/her decision making.  This  is  consistent  with
         the international best practices.


         The JSCI is responsible for the public advertisement,  shortlisting
         for interview and recommendation of a candidate to the  house.  The
         candidate must receive two thirds of  National  Assembly  votes  in
         order to be recommended to the President for appointment.


         The requirements of the post are:


              1.  The candidate shall be a South African citizen;
              2.  The candidate should be a person of integrity with insight
                 to intelligence; and
              3.   A  successful  candidate  should   undergo   a   security
                 clearance.


         The Committee unanimously resolves to:


              1.  Request Parliament to grant  JSCI  an  extension  for  the
                 appointment of the Inspector General until  31  July  2003;
                 and
              2.  Appeal to the South  African  public,  and  Parliament  to
                 assist in the identification  and  nomination  of  suitable
                 candidates to this important post.

National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Chairperson:


     (a)    Final Declaration of the Conference of  the  Inter-Parliamentary
         Union on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) held in Geneva  on  17-
         18 February 2003.


         Referred to the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs.


     (b)    Report of the Visit of the National Council of Provinces to  the
         North West Province (Taung and Mafikeng) 9-13 March 2003:


         1. Concept


              The innovation of the "Parliament  to  the  People"  programme
              lies in moving Parliament from Cape Town to  a  place  in  the
              provinces. The National Council of Provinces  is,  unlike  the
              National Assembly, permitted  to  meet  outside  the  seat  of
              Parliament in Cape Town.


              Parliament has a responsibility to educate and  inform  people
              about its work. Parliament also has a responsibility to ensure
              that its work is informed  by  the  views  of  the  people  it
              represents.  And  Parliament  has  a  responsibility  to  make
              special efforts to reach those parts of  the  electorate  that
              are unable to participate on account of distance, poverty or a
              lack of education.


              Many  of  our  people  are  unfamiliar  with  their  right  to
              participate  in  government,   unfamiliar   with   legislative
              processes in general, and unfamiliar with the role of the NCOP
              in particular.


              The "Parliament to the People" programme was conceived as both
              a public-education and a  public-participation  programme.  In
              respect to public education, the NCOP is a  public  forum  for
              debate and needs to make its proceedings and  decisions  known
              to the public through media and personal contact.  In  respect
              to public participation, the NCOP needs to  be  responsive  to
              the  people  and  take  their  views  into   account.   Public
              participation alerts the NCOP  to  problems  and  achievements
              faced by our people. Listening to what  people  have  to  tell
              Parliament strengthens  the  NCOP's  ability  to  oversee  the
              implementation of key programmes for their benefit.


         2. Location and attendance


              On the 9, 10 and 11 March the NCOP sat in the Mmabana Cultural
              Centre at Taung, a market town serving a rural district in the
              North West Province. On 11 and 12 March the NCOP  sat  in  the
              Embassy Hall in  Mafikeng,  the  capital  of  the  North  West
              province.


              A number of general points are worth making about the  venues,
              one rural and one urban, and the interaction between  MPs  and
              the people who participated in the parliamentary proceedings.


              First, a great number of  people  attended  the  parliamentary
              proceedings in  Taung.  The  formal  session  in  the  Mmabana
              cultural centre was held in a large gymnasium and  the  people
              sat in the gallery from where they would normally watch a game
              of basket ball or indoor football. The gallery was  filled  to
              overflowing and the remainder were  accommodated  in  a  large
              theatre in the centre  from  where  they  were  able  to  hear
              proceedings.  The  large  turn-out  was  the  result  of   the
              effective advertising of the event  in  local  structures  and
              through local radio. The turn-out also attests to the good co-
              operation between  the  NCOP  administration,  the  provincial
              legislature,  and  local  government  representatives  in  the
              Bophirima municipality.


              Second, the location of  the  session  in  a  modern  one-stop
              cultural centre in Taung facilitated the participation of  the
              people in parliamentary proceedings.


              Third,  the  design  of  the  programme  provided  the   ideal
              interface  for  MPs  to  engage   with   people   from   rural
              communities.  More  than  anything  else  it  emphasised   the
              importance Parliament attaches to the business of bringing our
              constitution  to  life  and  sustaining  it  through   ongoing
              dialogue, interaction and discourse. The programme provided  a
              unique opportunity to share  experiences  and  enhance  mutual
              understanding. The feedback that MPs received  from  community
              representatives provided invaluable information, and set  down
              key markers in improving the delivery of services.


              Fourth, the enthusiastic participation of North West MECs  and
              provincial politicians was made in the spirit of  co-operative
              governance. Enormous care was taken over  the  preparation  of
              background material on social welfare  and  opportunities  for
              economic development. In fact, enthusiastic participation  led
              to lengthy speeches that crowded out  the  time  available  to
              listen to people's contributions.


              Fifth, the ability of MPs to interact with the people in  many
              languages was noteworthy.


              Sixth, the open nature of the  meetings  allowed  for  a  wide
              range of participants to express their  viewpoints.  Of  great
              interest was the  active  participation  of  members  of  ward
              committees.


              Seventh, there was considerable radio and television  coverage
              of the programme. On the first day in Taung etv and  the  SABC
              broadcast news clips and  thereafter  there  were  many  radio
              interviews with MPs. The impact was considerable on the  local
              level, but less so at a national level and in the print media.


              Last but not least, the  NCOP  sat  in  the  Embassy  Hall  in
              Mafikeng. Fewer people attended our proceedings there than  in
              Taung, but this did little to dampen  enthusiasm  or  diminish
              the quality of the contributions.


         3. Proceedings


              Meetings were  held  with  the  following  groups  of  people:
              traditional  leaders  and  councillors,   women,   youth   and
              organised  groups,   farmers,   business   organisations   and
              individual entrepreneurs, educators and  civil  servants,  and
              lawyers.


              The report highlights the main issues raised at  each  meeting
              and the recommendations made.


              (a) Meeting with Traditional Leaders and Councillors


                  Topic: opportunities for  cooperative  governance,  issues
                  affecting the IDP, job creation and rural  development  at
                  local and provincial government level


                  Presentation: Mr D.E. Afrika  (MEC  for  Local  Government
                  and Housing)


                  The following issues were discussed:


                  (i)  The lack  of  coordination  between  councillors  and
                            traditional  leaders   on   the   delivery   of
                            services.


                  (ii) The  need  to  address  poverty  and  illiteracy,  in
                            particular,  in  areas  under  the  control  of
                            traditional leaders.


                  (iii)        The   problems   faced    by    female-headed
                            households.


                  (iv) The large number of  poorly-educated  and  unemployed
                            youth in the area.
                  (v)  The lack of accessibility  to  land  in  those  areas
                            under traditional leaders' control.


                  (vi) Proposed  remuneration  to  traditional  leaders  for
                            attending  local  government  meetings  to   be
                            extended to ward committees.


                  The following progress was recorded  on  the  delivery  of
                  services:


                  (i)  Electricity:  The  supply  of  electricity  has  been
                            improved to many areas, but there  is  still  a
                            capacity problem. In  the  2001/2002  financial
                            year, 5,000 connections were made.  Funds  have
                            been secured  for  7,000  connections  for  the
                            2003/2004 financial year, but that would  leave
                            a backlog of 23,011 connections.


                  (ii) Sanitation: It was reported  that  106  installations
                            were made in rural villages over the  past  few
                            months.


                  (iii)       Water:   The   municipality   has   begun   to
                            distribute free water to communities, but there
                            is a lack of infrastructure in some areas.


                  (iv) Housing: There has been robust  housing  development,
                            particularly in the Ba-ga Mothibi area.


                  (v)  Roads: There are programmes underway to  upgrade  the
                            roads.


              (b) Meeting with women


                  Topic: the role of women in pushing back the frontiers  of
                  poverty


                  Presentation:  Mrs  G.N.  Pandor   (Chairperson   of   the
                  National Council of Provinces)


                  During discussion the following issues emerged:


                  (i)  Traditional Leaders  refuse  to  provide  women  with
                            licences to mine.


                  (ii) Pension pay-out centres need to have facilities  such
                            as  toilets,  seating,  and  shelter  for   the
                            pensioners.


                  (iii)      The Government needs  to  assist  parents,  who
                            cannot afford to  pay  school  fees  for  their
                            children.


                  (iv) Women had grouped  themselves  into  enterprises  and
                            small businesses and often  submitted  business
                            plans  and  tenders  to  the  parastatals,  but
                            without any success.


                  (v)   The  Office  on  the  Status  of  Women  should   be
                            decentralised in order to reach as  many  women
                            as possible.


                  (vi) Health volunteers assist many of  the  old  women  in
                            the  communities,  but  did  not  receive   any
                            grants, and had to use their own funds.


                  (vii)       Certain  officials  required  members  of  the
                            public to pay them R5, R10 or R30 for accessing
                            pensions and other grants.


                  (viii)     Certain perpetrators of violence against  women
                            bribed the police to assist them


                  Responses from MPs and provincial politicians:


                  (i)  The chiefs and local councillors had recently held  a
                            meeting on the issue of women being  helped  to
                            acquire contracts and  businesses.  The  chiefs
                            had encouraged women  who  were  interested  in
                            opening   mines   to    register    as    close
                            corporations,  and  to  approach   the   tribal
                            authorities in this regard.


                  (ii) In terms of the procurement  framework  that  applies
                            to  government  at  all  levels,  all  required
                            services had  to  go  out  to  tender.  If  the
                            relevant MEC was  not  responding  to  queries,
                            then people should  approach  the  constituency
                            offices of their public representatives.
                  (iii)      Parents who were unemployed and who  could  not
                            afford  school   fees   should   complete   the
                            necessary exemption forms. Children  could  not
                            be  expelled  from  school  for  nonpayment  of
                            school fees.


                  (iv) The facilities at  pension  pay-points  were  in  the
                            process of being improved.


                  (v)   The  issue  of  nonrecognition   and   support   for
                            volunteers  was  an  area  that  needed  to  be
                            addressed. The Department  of  Social  services
                            should be engaging with social workers. It  was
                            however  also  important   to   remember   that
                            volunteers,   by   definition,   offer    their
                            assistance for free.


                  (vi) Government had recognised the impact of  HIV/Aids  on
                            families and women  in  particular.  Therefore,
                            even young adults,  who  were  responsible  for
                            younger  siblings,  were  able  to  apply   for
                            housing subsidies.


                  (vii)      The public needed to approach  the  Independent
                            Complaints Directorate and the MEC  for  Safety
                            and Security  to  report  all  instances  where
                            police  were  not  implementing  the   Domestic
                            Violence  legislation  and/or  were   accepting
                            bribes.


              (c) Meeting with Youth and Organised Groups


                  Topic:   promoting   and/or   creating   initiatives   and
                  partnerships aimed  at  defeating  poverty  and  promoting
                  development


                  Presentation:  Mr  P.D.  Maloyi  (member  of   the   Joint
                  Monitoring Committee on  the  Improvement  of  Quality  of
                  Life of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons)


                  Some of the issues raised were:


                  (i)   Youths  identified   the   role   they   played   in
                            dismantling apartheid and agreed that the  same
                            energy that was displayed in fighting apartheid
                            should be channelled towards youth development.
                  (ii) Youths noted that one of  the  challenges  after  the
                            democratisation of South Africa  was  to  bring
                            youth issues to the national agenda. Thus,  the
                            following organisations had  been  established:
                            the National Youth Commission, the  North  West
                            Youth Commission, a youth desk in the Office of
                            the  Presidency,  and  a  youth  desk  in   the
                            Premier's Office in the North West Province.


                  (iii)      The North West Youth Commission has  undertaken
                            to embark on a development programme.


                  (iv) A programme, jointly initiated by the  South  African
                            Defence   Force   and   the   National    Youth
                            Commission, was established to recruit youth to
                            join the Defence Force in order  to  give  them
                            the opportunity to study.


                  (v)  A research project, the initiative of the North  West
                            Youth Commission  and  the  University  of  the
                            North West,  would  culminate  in  a  strategic
                            planning  session   that   would   enable   the
                            formulation of  a  business  plan  on  how  the
                            Commission would envisage itself in the  coming
                            years.


                  Challenges identified;


                  (i)  Better information needs  to  be  made  available  by
                            government on how to apply for Umsobomvu funds.


                  (ii) Improve coordination  between  the  Youth  Commission
                            and   provincial   departments    over    youth
                            development.


                  (iii)      Career guidance at schools.


                  (iv) Youths going in to business still  face  difficulties
                            in  applying  for  funds,   as   most   lending
                            institutions require collateral for loans.


              (d) Public hearing


                  Topic: Poverty Alleviation and Social Grants


                  Presentation: M.J. Mahlangu  (Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
                  NCOP)


                  The following emerged from the presentation and comments:


                  (i)  People in rural areas are more  affected  by  poverty
                            than people in urban areas.


                  (ii) Rural women are the most affected by rural poverty.


                  (iii)      Government has taken a  decision  to  alleviate
                            poverty  in   general   and,   in   particular,
                            programmes  are  focussed   on   rural   women,
                            children, youth, the disabled, aged and  people
                            affected/infected with HIV/AIDS.


                  (iv) Women were encouraged to form co-operatives in  order
                            to establish small businesses


                  (v)  It was noted that  child  grants  are  sometimes  not
                            utilised  for  the   purpose   meant   for   by
                            guardians.


                  (vi) Pensioners raised concern about  fraudulent  funeral-
                            policy schemes.


                  (vii)      Volunteers raised  concerns  about  a  lack  of
                            recognition for their work.


                  (viii)     A concern was raised  about  the  behaviour  of
                            social workers towards the  elderly  and  those
                            who apply for disability grants.


                  (ix) Some chiefs required remuneration  before  confirming
                            that people lived in areas under their control.


                  (x)  The absence of an  identity  document  has  prevented
                            some people from applying for social grants.


                  Responses:


                  1.   Education: provincial government has budgeted  R18  m
                       to renovate and build 14 schools. Feeding schemes are
                       in place in  most  schools  and,  in  particular,  in
                       schools situated on farms.


                  2.   Delivery of free basic  services:  in  some  villages
                       government has succeeded  in  delivering  free  basic
                       service to the poor.


                  3.   Social Grant System: It  was  noted  that  since  the
                       introduction of pension committees,  the  payment  of
                       pensions has improved.


              (e) Meeting with Farming Community and Farmers


                  Topic: opportunities and challenges for  emerging  farmers
                  and  the  possibilities   for   partnership   arrangements
                  between established and emerging farmers.


                  Presentation: Rev P. Moatshe (Chairperson  of  the  Select
                  Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs, NCOP)


                  Participants raised the following issues.


                  (i)  It was noted that the Department of  Agriculture  had
                            developed a plan that highlights the importance
                            of developing  small-scale  farming,  a  sector
                            that  had  received  little  infrastructure  or
                            financial support in the past.


                  (ii) In the past resources were devoted to one  sector  of
                            the farming community, that is, the large-scale
                            commercial  farming  sector  and  the  emerging
                            farming  sector  was   ignored.   The   present
                            government  has  undertaken   an   agricultural
                            development   policy,   which   provides    for
                            development for all farmers in South Africa.


                  (iii)      The Department  of  Agriculture  has  developed
                            the Broadening the Access to Agriculture  Trust
                            (BATAT), which is focused on the services  that
                            government can provide for meeting the needs of
                            farmers.  BATAT  seeks  ways  of   managing   a
                            diversified agricultural  sector  in  the  most
                            cost effective way.


                  (iv) The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture  (27
                            November  2001)  is  a  mutual  strategy   that
                            provides the focus  to  unite  the  sector.  It
                            recognizes the need to  maintain  and  increase
                            commercial production, to  build  international
                            competitiveness, and to address the  historical
                            legacies that have resulted in skewed access to
                            land.


                  (v)   The  Land  and  Agricultural  Development  Bank   is
                            providing   an   enabling    environment    for
                            sustainable  economic  growth   and   long-term
                            success of farmers and, particularly,  emerging
                            farmers. Projects taken on by the Land Bank are
                            aligned to  the  Integrated  Rural  Development
                            Strategy of which the primary objective  is  to
                            conduct  a  sustained  campaign  against  rural
                            poverty,   unemployment   and   infrastructural
                            underdevelopment.    In    pursuit    of    its
                            developmental  mandate  it  continually   seeks
                            creative ways to promote  the  empowerment  and
                            development of  developing  farmers  to  assist
                            them in making  a  shift  from  small-scale  to
                            fully-fledged commercial farmers.


                  (vi)  Land  redistribution  for  agricultural  development
                            supports  and  assists  the  implementation  of
                            Government's land reform programme. It  enables
                            previously disadvantaged individuals to receive
                            grant  funding  from  the  Department  of  Land
                            affairs  as  well  as   to   obtain   financial
                            assistance in the form of loans from  the  Land
                            Bank.


                  The following  challenges  facing  the  farming  community
                  were identified:


                  (i)   The  broadening  of  participation  in  farming,  in
                            particular among the youth and women  in  order
                            to provide equitable access  and  participation
                            in agriculture to ensure broad participation in
                            communities,


                  (ii) The availability  of  arable  land  for  farming,  in
                            particular  for  the  previously  disadvantaged
                            communities.


                  (iii)      Availability of  markets  for  the  established
                            small-scale commercial farmers.


                  (iv) Training for emerging farmers.


                  (v)  Capital for emerging farmers.


                  Responses from provincial politicians:


                  (i)  The Land Bank has forged partnerships to bring  about
                            a sharing of ideas and best practices  so  that
                            it   can   better   align    programmes    with
                            Government's vision and support  Government  in
                            implementing its development initiatives.


                  (ii) There is a temporary fund to assist emerging  farmers
                            in terms of tools and loans to  start  farming.
                            The problem of land was addressed  through  the
                            Land Reform Programme.


                  (iii)      To address the  concern  of  job  creation  and
                            volunteers, an internship  programme  had  been
                            created and  302  students  had  recently  been
                            trained, 150 of whom will be placed in farming.


              (f)  Meeting  with  Business  Organisations   and   Individual
                  Entrepreneurs (held in Mafikeng)


                  Topic:  how  can  the  business   sector   contribute   to
                  alleviate poverty


                  Presentation: Mr M.J. Kuskus (North West MEC for Finance)


                  Poverty  and  unemployment,  caused  by   the   systematic
                  efforts of the previous government to make sure that  only
                  a  racial  minority  benefited  from  the  wealth  of  the
                  country,  are  the  two  biggest  challenges  facing   the
                  country.


                  This in turn resulted in South Africa  being  one  of  the
                  most  unequal  countries  in  the  world   in   terms   of
                  opportunities and resources.  Since  1994  the  government
                  has attempted through bold legislative  and  institutional
                  framework to tackle the problem head on.


                  The State has a very important role  to  play  in  poverty
                  alleviation. But it needs the support of  social  partners
                  like a vibrant private sector as well as  the  involvement
                  of all other sectors of the community.


                  Throughout  the  world  the  notion  of   good   corporate
                  citizenship  is  coming  to  the  fore.  Business   cannot
                  operate in isolation from the  community  it  is  serving.
                  Business needs to influence positively the environment  in
                  which they conduct their business so that the client  base
                  can be broadened.


                  The following  challenges  were  identified  in  order  to
                  encourage good corporate citizenship;


                  1.   Corporate social investment  strategy  to  make  sure
                       that real empowerment takes place.


                  2.   Everyone to be responsive to the environment and  the
                       preservation of natural resources, and to maintain  a
                       responsible tax culture.


                  3.   Businesses should also, in terms  of  good  corporate
                       citizenship,   look   at   the   implementation    of
                       procurement   policies   that   benefit    previously
                       disadvantaged individuals.


              (g) Meeting with Educators and Civil Servants
                  Topic: economic development as a key to job  creation  and
                  poverty alleviation


                  Presentation: Mrs  G.N.  Pandor  MP  (Chairperson  of  the
                  National Council of Provinces); Mr Z Tolo (North West  MEC
                  for Education)


                  The challenges faced  by  the  North  West  Department  of
                  Education were the following:


                  (i)  The Department is  currently  in  the  process  of  a
                            major  schools  curriculum  transformation.   A
                            process of phasing in this curriculum in grades
                            1 - 9 is under way, and plans are under way  to
                            phase in grades 10 - 12.


                  (ii) The second major  change  is  the  restructuring  and
                            landscaping of Further Education  and  Training
                            (FET) colleges.


                  (iii)       The  Department  is  also   transforming   the
                            curriculum within the  colleges.  The  Province
                            inherited 17 colleges in 1994:  seven  of  them
                            were  teacher  colleges;  three  were  manpower
                            centres;  and  another   six   were   technical
                            colleges. Eleven of these have been merged  and
                            three FET institutions have been created.


                  (iv) The Department is in  partnership  with  the  private
                            sector, in particular,  the  National  Business
                            Initiative. It is assisting the Department  and
                            plays   an   important   role   in   curriculum
                            transformation.


                  (v)   Currently  many  teachers  are  under-qualified   or
                            unqualified, but since 1996 a programme of  re-
                            skilling has been undertaken.


                  (vi) In some schools hotel management and hospitality  are
                            offered as  subjects.  The  North  West  has  a
                            greater potential for tourism.  The  foundation
                            needs  to  be  laid  at  the  level  of  junior
                            secondary and even primary schools.


                  (vii)      To address the problem  of  children  going  to
                            school hungry, the  Department  of  Health  had
                            introduced a feeding  scheme  for  children  in
                            primary schools from grades 1-7.


                  (viii)      In  the  next  financial  year's  budget   the
                            Department  would  put  aside  money   to   buy
                            gardening equipment that would  be  distributed
                            to  schools  to  encourage  children  to  start
                            gardening. The intention is  to  encourage  the
                            growth of vegetables  that  would  be  used  to
                            prepare hot soup for children.


                  (ix)  The  Department  would   identify   technical   high
                            schools, especially  those  far  from  the  FET
                            institutions, so as to make them satellites  of
                            these institutions in order to  cut  travelling
                            costs.


                  (x)  The issue of subject  advisors  is  being  addressed.
                            The  Department  is  currently   undergoing   a
                            process of being strengthened and restructured.
                            When the new structure is in place, it will  be
                            better  able  to   assist   schools   in   this
                            connection.


                  (xi) The Department will be embarking on  a  programme  to
                            provide bicycles  for  learners  to  facilitate
                            long-distance travelling  by  those  living  on
                            farms.


              (h) Meeting with Legal Fraternity


                  Topic:  the  role  and   responsibility   of   the   legal
                  profession  in  creating  an  ethos  of  volunteerism   to
                  promote social justice


                  Presentation: Mr M.E. Surty  (Chief  Whip  of  the  NCOP);
                  Madam Justice B.E. Nkabinde  (Bophuthatswana  Division  of
                  High Court)


                  Among some of the issues highlighted were:


                  (i)  That the rule of law and  the  effective  functioning
                            and legal system are central to the elements of
                            good governance.


                  (ii) It was noted that the strength of a  country's  legal
                            system does not depend on the judiciary  alone,
                            but also on the joint efforts  of  the  courts,
                            lawyers and government.


                  (iii)      The most important element  necessary  for  the
                            professional independence  is  the  maintenance
                            and enhancement of  public  confidence  in  the
                            profession and the judiciary.


                  The challenges faced by the legal profession, in order  to
                  influence law and public policy were identified as:


                  (i)  The legal profession should be alive to the  cultural
                            diversity of the people  of  South  Africa  and
                            respect  the  rights  of  diverse  groups   and
                            minorities, and must clearly see the  realities
                            of the world so as to achieve social justice.


                  (ii) In spite of the provisions of the  Constitution  that
                            relate to the  right  to  legal  representation
                            many South Africans are tried in criminal cases
                            without legal representation, because they  are
                            too poor  to  pay  or  do  not  understand  the
                            nature, extent and effect of  their  rights  in
                            criminal proceedings.
                  (iii)      Some of the factors that may contribute to  the
                            ethos  of  promoting  social  justice  are  the
                            following; encourage class actions; revive  pro
                            bono work; and  examine  the  need  to  educate
                            every citizen about his/her rights.


         4. Conclusions and recommendations:


              1.  In order to address all the challenges facing the  Greater
                 Taung municipalities, there is a need to  create  jobs  and
                 provide   opportunities   for   education,   training   and
                 development.


              2.  In order to revive tourism, resources are needed to market
                 areas declared heritage sites.


              3.  Strengthening relations between traditional leaders,  ward
                 committees,  the   farming   community,   youth   and   all
                 stakeholders in order to have  a  foundation  for  mutually
                 beneficial planning and development.


              4.   Developing   a   partnership   between   the   provincial
                 government, local government and traditional leaders.


              5.  Ward committees need to be strengthened and  developed  so
                 as to be able to take a vital role in development.


              6.  The government should find ways and means of investigating
                 the issue of debts owed by municipalities,  as  it  affects
                 the delivery of free basic services to the people.


              7.  A memorandum of understanding should be signed between the
                 provincial Youth Commission and Umsobomvu fund, and a  road
                 show should be undertaken in order to inform the  youth  in
                 the North West Province about the fund.


              8.  Field workers should be employed in all the four districts
                 of the North West in  order  to  work  closely  with  local
                 councils that have youth councils in their midst.


              9.  The National Youth Commission should liase with the  South
                 African Local Government Association (SALGA) to establish a
                 youth desk in all the mayoral offices that are  members  of
                 SALGA in order to integrate issues affecting the  youth  in
                 the planning of the municipal programmes.


              10.  The  provincial  department  should  engage  with  social
                  workers in  and  around  Taung  to  try  and  address  the
                  concerns of community members.
              11. A partnership should be developed  between  the  Land  and
                  Agricultural  Development  Bank  and  the  National  Youth
                  Commission with the objective of utilizing  the  farms  in
                  the possession of the Land Bank in order  to  promote  the
                  establishment of aspirant young  farmers  on  these  farms
                  and provide them with the necessary training  and  support
                  to   ensure   they   become   viable    and    sustainable
                  entrepreneurs.


              12. The MEC for Agriculture in the North West should  call  an
                  "Imbizo"  and  explain  all  the   programmes   that   are
                  available  in  the  agricultural  sector   for   assisting
                  emerging farmers.


              13. That the report be referred to all  select  committees  of
                  the National Council of Provinces,  for  consideration  on
                  matters that were raised by presenters and the public.
