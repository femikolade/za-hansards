                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I intend moving  the
following motion:


  That this House -


  (1) disapproves of the failure of the Chief Whips' Forum to address the
       DA's request for the appointment of an ad hoc committee to
       investigate the JIT report relating to the arms deal scandal;


  (2) believes that the failure by the Chief Whips' Forum is explained by
       the fact that the ANC has no desire to have a thoroughgoing
       investigation and will do whatever is necessary to cover up the
       scandal;


  (3) affirms that it is entirely proper for Scopa to investigate whether
       it was misled by the Auditor-General; and


  (4) resolves -


       (a)  that any further investigation into the arms deal scandal should
           be undertaken by an ad hoc committee, representative of all
           parties and including members of Scopa and members of portfolio
           committees such as Trade and Industry, Finance, Defence, Justice
           and Public Service and other interested committees; and
       (b)  to instruct the Chief Whips' Forum to expedite its discussion
           and decision so that the House can proceed with the appointment
           of the committee.

[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                  GROWTH IN SOUTH AFRICAN TOURISM INDUSTRY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr D M BAKKER: Mevrou die Speaker ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing
voor:


  Dat die Huis -


     (1)    kennis neem dat -


         (a)     Suid-Afrika se toerisme steeds floreer terwyl toerisme in
              baie ander lande 'n afname in besoekergetalle ondervind vanweë
              die oorlog in Irak en ander faktore; en


         (b)     die eerste kwartaal se toerismesyfers op 'n toename van
              11,3% dui, wat bevestig dat Suid-Afrika sy posisie as een van
              die gewildste toerismebestemmings verstewig; en


       2) glo dat die toeristetoename nie net positief is vir Suid-Afrika
          se beeld nie, maar ook dui op 'n toename in internasionale
          vertroue in ons land.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr D M BAKKER: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


     (1)    notes that -


         (a)     South Africa's tourism continues to flourish while tourism
              to other countries experiences a decrease in visitor numbers
              as a result of the war in Iraq and other factors; and


         (b)     the tourism figures for the first quarter show an increase
              of 11,3%, which confirms that South Africa is strengthening
              its position as one of the most popular tourist destinations;
              and


     (2)    believes that the increase in tourist numbers is not only
         positive for South Africa's image, but also points to an increase
         in international confidence in our country.]

Agreed vote.

                       REGISTRATION OF YOUTH AS VOTERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G  B  MAGWANISHE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  during  the  first  democratic
elections in 1994 there was a high voter turn-out. Ninety three  percent  of
young people between the ages of 19 to 25 voted in the first elections.

However, a large number of young people did not vote in the 1999 general
elections. Research has shown that the low voter turn-out of youth in the
last elections was because they did not register to vote due to, among
other things, a lack of bar-coded identity documents.

Young people, as the future leaders, must play an active role in building a
better future for themselves and for the people of South Africa, within the
context of seizing opportunities created as a result of freedom. Young
people must exercise their right to choose a party of their choice to
govern this country and champion their cause.

The ANC calls on all young people who are eligible to vote to get identity
documents and register as voters, and participate in next year's general
elections. The ANC further calls on Government to make it easier for young
people in school and the unemployed youth to apply for and access their
identity documents. [Applause.]

                     VIOLENCE IN GOVERNANCE OF ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G B D McINTOSH (DA): Madam Speaker, in the past week we have all seen
the horrific reality of totalitarian rule in Zimbabwe. The Mail &
Guardian's front page photograph ... [Interjections.] Madam Speaker, these
members seem to be insensitive to the suffering of fellow Africans.
[Interjections.] The Mail & Guardian's front page photograph of a
Zimbabwean policeman's boot pressing a citizen's neck to the ground;
photographs of opposition supporters beaten and bloodied by security
forces; the appalling and dehumanising treatment of MDC leader, Morgan
Tsvangirai, who was escorted into court yesterday in a prison uniform, and
with his feet shackled and his hands cuffed. The old regime in this country
would have done the same.

The MDC has consistently followed the route of legal, constitutional and
non-violent means to assert its majority support and Mugabe's illegitimacy
as president. Yet its leader is treated like a common and violent criminal.
[Interjections.] Despite these horrors and the damage to our own economy,
the silence from President Mbeki has been deafening. [Interjections.] The
World Economic Forum provides the perfect platform for him to break his
silence. [Interjections.]

The DA calls on the President to condemn the arrest and imprisonment of
Zimbabwe's opposition leader and the brutal oppression of his supporters.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                        CRIME AND THE ROLE OF JUSTICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz M XULU (IFP): Mhlonishwa Somlomo, abantu bakithi bayahlukumezeka
ngenxa yobugebengu obunhlobonhlobo obenzeka kuzo zonke izindawo lapho
behlala khona. Okuyaye kube buhlungu kakhulu ukuthi esikhathini esiningi
abaze bangaluthola usizo olwanele nolusheshayo kwezomthetho. Ngesinye
isikhathi izinswelaboya azibanjwa, kwesinye isikhathi nesezibanjiwe
zingagwetshwa. Lokhu sekuqede ithemba kwabaningi mayelana neqhaza elibanjwa
yisandla somthetho ekulweni nobugebengu. Kwezinye izindawo sekuze kwabanga
ukuthi abantu bazithathele umthetho ngezandla ukuze bazivikele
ngezinkantolo zasehlathini. Lokhu-ke akulungile futhi kuyingozi ngoba
kwesinye isikhathi kujeziswa abantu abangenacala.

Nokho kuyathokozisa ukuthi phezu kwalezi zinkinga zobugebengu ezikhungethe
isizwe, kunezindawo lapho kukhona ukusebenzisana phakathi kwezisebenzi
zomthetho, amaphoyisa, kanye nomphakathi ukulweni nobugebengu ngendlela
eyimpumelelo. Njengasendaweni yaseBabanango - KwaZulu, imantshi,
umshushisi, umphathi wesiteshi samaphoyisa, amakhosi endawo kanye
nomphakathi basebenza ngokukhulu ukubambisana ekulweni nobugebengu kule
ndawo. Ngenxa yalokhu kubambisana sekuboshwe izigebengu kanti
nezigilamkhuba ebeseziningi sezinciphile.
Okuncomekayo ukuthi kule ndawo imantshi yakhona umuntu wesifazane
nomshushisi wakhona umuntu wesifazane, okuyikhona okwenza ukuthi umsebenzi
uhambe kalula. Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu speech
follows.)

[Miss M XULU (IFP): Hon Speaker, our people are being victimised by all
sorts of crime, which takes place wherever people live. What is even more
painful is that, more often than not, people don't get enough help from the
law enforcement agencies, or they don't get it quickly enough. Sometimes
the culprits are not apprehended and those who have been apprehended go
free. This has discouraged many people in so far as the role played by law
enforcement in combating crime is concerned. In some places this has caused
people to take the law into their own hands in order to protect themselves
through extrajudicial courts. This is not right, and it is dangerous
because sometimes the innocent get punished.

However, it makes one happy that in spite of these problems which are
prevalent in the country, there are still areas where there is
collaboration between law officers, the police and the community in
combating crime in a successful manner. In Babanango, KwaZulu-Natal, for
example, the magistrate, prosecutor, station commander, local traditional
leaders and community are working together in combating crime in this area.
Because of this collaboration, a lot of criminals have been arrested and
the wrongdoers who had increased have been brought to a minimum.

What is commendable in this area is that the magistrate is a woman and so
is the prosecutor, which is the reason why the job runs so smoothly. Thank
you. [Applause.]]

             LAUNCHING OF WALTER SISULU HOPE FOR CHILDREN AWARD

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M L NGWENYA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Walter Sisulu Hope for Children
Award was launched in Johannesburg on Tuesday, 10 June 2003. This award
will serve to recognise the efforts of individuals who have lent a helping
hand to make a difference in the lives of children. It is befitting that
such an award is named after the late Comrade Walter Sisulu who, throughout
his life, made immense sacrifices, fighting for freedom in order to build a
better life for all and especially the children.

The ANC welcomes the Walter Sisulu Hope for Children Award, and further
believes that this award will encourage later generations to carry forward
Comrade Sisulu's legacy of contributing to make the world a better place
for its people, especially its children. [Applause.]

    CALM SURROUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT OF SALARY INCREASES FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Speaker, die rustige
atmosfeer waarin die aankondiging van salarisverhogings aan staatsamptenare
vanjaar plaasgevind het, is 'n aanduiding van die suksesse wat in Suid-
Afrika behaal kan word wanneer belangegroepe bereid is om soos
verantwoordelike bouers aan die nuwe Suid-Afrika te soek na oplossings
rondom die onderhandelingstafel eerder as in die strate of in die media.

Anders as vorige jare waarin dreigemente van massa-aksie en gepaardgaande
negatiewe persepsies die wêreld ingestuur is wat beleggersvertroue geskaad
het, behoort die rustigheid omtrent die aankondiging van 'n
salarisverhoging van 9,5% positiewe seine uit te stuur.

Dit is ook verblydend dat die Minister vir die Staatsdiens en Administrasie
in hierdie stadium nie bereid is om die sperdatum vir die
herskikkingsproses te verskuif nie. Staatsdepartemente het voldoende tyd
gehad om die herskikkingsprogram te voltooi.

Hierdie proses kan nie langer vertraag word nie, aangesien belangrike poste
nou gevul moet word wat tot dusver deur die moratorium op aanstellings
gekortwiek is. Hierdie moratorium het 'n onnodige las op departemente
geplaas wat teen miljoene rande van die duurste konsultante gebruik moes
maak.

Die Nuwe NP wil die Minister gelukwens met haar knap en ferme hantering van
hierdie baie belangrike aangeleenthede. Sy is 'n rolmodel vir sommige van
haar kabinetskollegas, veral vir die Minister van Binnelandse Sake, die
alliansievennoot van die DA. Ek dank u. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Madam Speaker, the calm atmosphere in
which the announcement of salary increases for public servants took place
this year is an indication of the successes that can be achieved in South
Africa when the interested parties are prepared, like responsible builders
of the new South Africa, to seek new solutions around the negotiating
table, instead of on the streets or in the media.

In contrast with previous years, when threats of mass action, together with
negative perceptions, were sent into the world, which damaged investor
confidence, the calm surrounding the announcement of a salary increase of
9.5% should send out positive signals.

It is also heartening that the Minister for the Public Service and
Administration is not prepared to shift the deadline to complete the
transition process at this stage. Government departments have had
sufficient time to complete the transition programme.

This process cannot be delayed any longer, because important positions that
could not be filled because of the moratorium on appointments, must now be
filled. This moratorium has placed an unnecessary burden on departments
that had to make use of the most expensive consultants at a cost of
millions of rands.

The New NP wishes to congratulate the Minister on her capable and firm
handling of these very important matters. She is a role-model for some of
the colleages in the Cabinet, especially the Minister of Home Affairs, the
alliance partner of the DA. I thank you. [Interjections.]

                        GROWING RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P H K DITSHETELO (UCDP): Madam Speaker, there is a worrying factor with
regard to the number of people who are losing their jobs on a daily basis
because of the state of our economy. Some of the problems are being
attributed to the rate at which our economy is growing - as we are not
meeting Gear targets - the high interest rates and the labour regime.

The major concern is the claim by businesses that they lay off workers due
to the rising high costs of production, especially with the manufacturing
companies. This means that this percentage adds to the already high number
of unemployment and the unemployable because of lack of skills.

The Government has to rethink its policies in terms of how companies that
add value to the economy of our country can be assisted so that they don't
close down.

With regard to the stimulation of the growth of the SMMEs, so far we have
not seen any concrete evidence with regard to this commitment. The Minister
of Trade and Industry, together with the Minister of Labour and the
Governor of the Reserve Bank, must come up with immediate short-term and
long-term plans to address this problem. The reality on the ground is that
poverty is wreaking havoc with our people.

   LAUNCHING OF TAXI INDUSTRY SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof S S RIPINGA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the MEC for transport in KwaZulu-
Natal, Comrade S'bu Ndebele, will officially launch the Taxi Industry's
Skills Development Project on Sunday, 15 June 2003, at Nquthu Stadium in
Northern KwaZulu-Natal. The objective of this pilot project is to train 150
taxi owners in road safety and business development management. The KwaZulu-
Natal Transport Department has invested R1,2 million in this ground-
breaking project.

The ANC congratulates MEC S'bu Ndebele, uManzankosi, the KwaZulu-Natal
transport department and other stakeholders for embarking on this project.
We hope that this project will contribute positively in enhancing road
safety and thus reducing the unnecessary loss of lives on our roads. The
ANC further calls on other provinces to emulate this shining example and
implement similar projects. Safety for our people, arrive alive!
[Applause.]

                          ATTACK PROMPTED BY RACISM

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss S RAJBALLY (MF): Madam Speaker, the MF is appalled by the racist
killing of 21-year-old Gugendrin Chetty near the Parow Night Club in
Amanzimtoti, KwaZulu-Natal, on the night of Friday, 6 June 2003. Gugendrin
and his friends, on the way to the club, were subjected to racist remarks
by two males not sharing their ancestral heritage. A verbal response
resulted in one of the attackers striking Chetty on the head with an
aluminium bat and running over Chetty's friend.

The MF expresses its disgust at this barbarism and denounces this behaviour
as unacceptable in our democracy. The MF is pleased with the South African
Police Services' swift arrest of the perpetrators and hopes that charges of
murder and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm will be met with
heavy sentences as punishment. Racism and discrimination are not to be
tolerated in South Africa.

The MF extends its condolences to the bereaved family of the late
Gugendrin. May he rest in peace. To the victims of this tragedy, we
sincerely apologise for your trauma. May God give you the strength to
overcome this ordeal and not allow the infestation of hatred in our
community as a result of this incident. Thank you.

                    TRANSPORT FOR LEARNERS IN RURAL AREAS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr O BAPELA (ANC): Madam Speaker, in his budget speech the MEC for
education in Gauteng, Ignatius Jacobs, highlighted that the ANC Government
has set aside R34 million to improve transport for learners in rural areas.
He indicated that the Government will be redesigning the rural transport
system to improve efficiency and to ensure greater access to schooling for
learners living far from schools, especially in rural areas and informal
settlements where there are no educational services.

The ANC believes that this move will alleviate some of the challenges
facing farm schools, including accessibility. This will also make pupils,
especially girls, less vulnerable to rape and abuse as they will no longer
have to request lifts or walk alone for long distances. The free scholar
transport system will also complement Government's plan to build hostels to
accommodate learners who live far from schools.

These plans are a demonstration of Government's commitment to building a
caring environment for children and a truly dynamic education system that
is accessible to all. The ANC welcomes the announcement made by the MEC
during his budget speech. [Applause.]

                    NEW NP'S STATUS IN ALLIANCE WITH ANC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N J J VAN R KOORNHOF (DA): Madam Speaker, the New NP is reverting back
to form, taking their old-style relationship of "baas" and "klaas" back on
board. Only, this time they are "klaas," according to "baas" Kader.
[Interjections.]

On 4 June 2003 the hon Minister Kader Asmal, while responding  to  a  speech
by the MEC Mr Gaum in the NCOP, said the following, and I quote:
  I mentioned at the beginning that one of the virtues of coming to this
  House is that you listen to special delegates, MECs, who come with the
  authority of the province. Hon MEC Gaum does not speak for the Western
  Cape. The majority of the members of that legislative assembly are ANC
  members. I represent ANC policy. I speak for the ANC policy here. We have
  the majority in that legislative assembly and he, Gaum, has not sought
  the consent of the ANC element, either in the Cabinet or the legislative
  assembly.

It is clear that at least the hon Minister Asmal understands the dynamics
of the alliance between the ANC and the New NP. The hon Asmal echoes the
concerns of the hon Dr Boy Geldenhuys when he admitted that the New NP does
not have any influence on the ANC. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

         SOUTH AFRICA'S RANKING IN AFRICA ACCORDING TO LATEST SURVEY

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Madam Speaker, the study released on the opening day
of the World Economic Forum's Africa Economic Summit in Durban on Wednesday
revealed that South Africa is ranked number four out of 21 African
countries in a newly conducted survey by the same forum. Botswana has been
ranked number one.

The survey's terms of reference comprised the rule of law, impressions on
corruption and the enforcement of contracts. The results of the survey
augur well for Africa in general and for South Africa in particular. There
could be no better economic news than this in the new millennium at the
height of the well-conceived African renaissance era and on the eve of the
New Partnership for Africa's Development.

To be seen by the outside world as being on top of the problems faced by
most governments, ie problems on the rule of law, corruption and botched
and elite-serving contracts is a step in the right direction. The study
reveals that South Africa was seen as the third least corrupt country, but
the overall impression of the country was dragged down by the perceived
costs linked to organised crime.

Therefore, on that very score we need, as a country, to focus our efforts
on fighting organised crime if it is seen by the influential economic
bodies and the outside world as dragging us down. We also need to fight
some traces and remnants of corruption amongst ourselves and in the private
and public organs. All state deals, as this is one of the major barometers
of assessing the rule of law and level of corruption, must be transparent
for all and sundry to see and reckon that indeed we subscribe to all the
principles of good governance.

                         ERADICATION OF CHILD LABOUR

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr J BENJAMIN (ANC): Madam Speaker, 12 June is the World Day Against Child
Labour. It is estimated that some 246 million children between the ages of
five and 17 years are working instead of attending school around the world.
Nearly three quarters of these children are exposed to work that is
hazardous to their health.

This day has been chosen to focus the world's attention on the urgent need
to eradicate child labour. The ANC believes that the problem of child
labour should be tackled by all sectors in society. There has to be
national consensus, national action and political will in society to tackle
this problem. The ANC calls on all South Africans to work towards the
eradication of child labour. [Applause.]

   INVESTIGATION INTO OWNERSHIP, EXISTENCE AND PRACTICES OF CREDIT BUREAUS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S PILLAY (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP is aware that credit
bureaus are entrenched institutions, and as entrenched institutions they
take on a life of their own and are prone to abuse their status, as they
become a law unto themselves.

The credit bureaus list a person negatively and that person is effectively
condemned for a period of five years. As an example, no reason is provided
for the listing. The effect is that many innocent people are listed and,
under the present system, very costly legal fees are needed to be cleared
from the bureaus. Many aspirant businesspeople find that they are listed
and that ensures that they cannot participate in the economy in terms of
SMMEs and other economic activities.

The New NP therefore calls on the Ministers in The Presidency, Trade and
Industry, and Finance to appoint a commission of inquiry into the
ownership, existence and practices of all credit bureaus. Furthermore, the
New NP calls on the relevant Ministers to re-examine the idea of a women's
bank to ensure that the prejudices of the retail banks do not affect South
Africans in general and women specifically. In most instances links have
been found between credit bureaus and retail banks. Credit bureaus directly
contribute to denying people job opportunities and causing job losses, as
some conveniently suffer from selective amnesia and blame the Minister of
Labour. [Applause.]

                  INTERNSHIP PROGRAMMES TO BOOST EXPERIENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B G MBULAWA-HANS (ANC): Madam Speaker, organised youth formations and
the National Youth Commission propose employment internship for youth in
the public and private sectors. This programme will address the problem of
lack of experience. Through this programme, young people will be exposed to
a world of work. This programme will also provide a possibility for young
people to be absorbed into full employment on the completion of their
learnership programmes. Government can recruit these interns to provide
service in needy areas and be cadres for community service.

The ANC-led Government has identified, as one of its priorities for this
year, the need to recruit young people to various Government Seta
programmes so that young people can get the necessary skills and
experience. The ANC welcomes Government's initiative to recruit youth to
these Seta programmes. The ANC calls on the private sector to emulate this
shining example and join hands with Government in tackling the challenge of
youth unemployment. Now is the time, vukuzenzele. [Applause.]

      INVESTIGATION OF CREDIT BUREAUS AND GROWING RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker and members, I
rise to respond to issues that were raised which relate to the economic
cluster of Ministers. I would just like to say to the member from the New
NP who raised the issue around the credit bureaus that indeed we will take
into consideration the concerns that have been raised and I am sure that
the relevant Ministers will soon be able to indicate what has been done.

With regard to the issue of the UCDP on the  challenge  of  unemployment  in
our country and  the  issues  of  the  growth  in  the  economy,  you  would
appreciate that these are matters that have been  deliberated  upon  in  the
growth summit, as well as in  preparation  for  going  to  that  summit,  by
various stakeholders in Government, business as well as labour, to  look  at
what mechanisms can be employed to ensure that we deal with  the  challenges
that South Africa faces. If there are any  proposals  that  the  hon  member
would like to make, I am sure the hon Ministers would be  able  to  look  at
them, and comment and indicate what would be done with those. [Applause.]

                     VIOLENCE IN GOVERNANCE OF ZIMBABWE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINSTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I just want to rise and say that
sometime in the course of late last year the question was raised, from the
floor in the House, as to ``why the ANC was not engaging in discussions
with the MDC, and why we were concentrating on Zanu-PF''.

Since then the President and President Obasanjo have led a move to initiate
discussions between Zanu-PF and the MDC. I said last week that it is not
helpful for the MDC to leave the talks and take to the streets and then, of
course, create an atmosphere as if there is unwillingness to negotiate a
settlement in Zimbabwe. [Interjections.]

We have been pushing Zanu-PF and the MDC to talk, and they must talk. They
are not going to solve the problems there by running away from the talks.
[Interjections.] They must go back to the talks. [Interjections.] The
picture of somebody walking in chains, handcuffed and so on, is not
something very grand to us. We have been subjected to worse situations by
the previous government. [Interjections.] [Applause.] They must go back to
the talks. We spent all of our lives persuading the white government in the
past, for years, to come to talk to us. They must go back to talk it out.
[Applause.]

   EXTENSION OF DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF REPORT OF AD HOC JOINT COMMITTEE ON
                                 REPARATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on behalf of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the motion printed in his name
on the Order Paper as follows:


  That, subject to the concurrence of the National Council of Provinces and
  notwithstanding the joint decision by the Speaker and the Chairperson of
  the National Council of Provinces (see Announcements, Tablings and
  Committee Reports, 24 April 2003, p 314) that was ratified by the House
  on 13 May 2003 (see Minutes of Proceedings, p 346), the date by which the
  Ad Hoc Joint Committee on Reparations has to submit a report to both
  Houses, be extended to 25 June 2003.

Agreed to.

            YOUTH ACTION TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF DEMOCRACY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The SPEAKER: Before the Minister takes the podium, I want to advise you
that I received, on your behalf, a declaration submitted by the Youth
Assembly meeting in Cape Town today. I wish to acknowledge the presence in
the gallery of representatives of the youth who have brought their concerns
and commitments to Parliament. [Applause.] The declaration submitted to
Parliament will be tabled. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Madam Speaker, thank you very much. I was
hoping you would say I was with you when you received it. [Laughter.]

Madam Speaker, hon members, it would seem to me that every year when we
mark the occasion of June 16, it behoves us to reflect upon the fact that
we are able to sit in this House, in this Parliament, debate, discuss, and
pass laws in this Parliament, because very, very, very, very many young
people sacrificed their blood and their lives so that we could enjoy the
fruits of freedom and democracy. [Applause.]

It is also an occasion for all of us, including the old youth, to renew our
commitments to the youth of our country. It is essential that we don't
speak a language which says we must give the youth opportunities, we must
do this, we must do that. There is no young person waiting for us to tell
them what to do. They are going to do it. The question is whether we have
the capacity to work with the young people of South Africa to improve the
quality of life of the masses of our people.

One of the critical structures that has assisted us in the mobilisation and
galvanisation of the youth in South Africa has been the National Youth
Commission. In its short life, the National Youth Commission has actively
promoted youth participation across a wide range of fronts and has ensured
that the voice of young people is part of the chorus of our democracy. They
have ensured a better and co-ordinated policy direction, youth information
sharing, capacity-building for the organisations of young people, concrete
input and recommendations into important national and international forums,
such as the World Conference against Racism, the WSSD, Nepad, the AU and,
recently, the Growth and Development Summit.

I do know, and I'm fairly certain that this will happen when the debate
takes place later, that there may be some amongst us who would argue that
the National Youth Commission should be disbanded. Let me say this here and
now: The National Youth Commission is not going to be disbanded, no matter
what those to my left say. [Applause.] And they would be wise to take the
opportunity that's given to youth organisations representing political
parties and other structures across the wide political spectrum to play a
role in ensuring that the young people of South Africa play their full part
in the political, economic, social and cultural life of our country. So,
never mind what they're going to say here. Let them speak; let them shout;
let them scream. The National Youth Commission is here to stay. [Applause.]

Recently, Madam Speaker, we had a very interesting development in South
Africa. Two weeks ago at the bi-annual general meeting of the South African
Youth Council, which is a youth council which brings together
representatives of organisations right across the political and ideological
spectrum in our country, no fewer than 150 organisations were represented
at that meeting, ranging from political formations such as the ANC Youth
League - even the DA Youth League was there - to the Federasie vir
Afrikaanse Kultuur. These are young intellectuals and volunteers of Africa.


What they did at that bi-annual meeting was quite clearly demonstrated:
That those of us who are still backward in terms of trying to mobilise
across this political and ideological spectrum in the national interest
will get left even further behind. And this, in my view, was a great
achievement of the South African Youth Council in which both the National
Youth Commission as well as the Umsobomvu Fund played a critical role.

It is obvious that one of the most critical issues that we face today is
the reality of unemployment amongst our young people, that is, specifically
young women and young people with disabilities. At the core of this is the
problem and the challenge of unemployment in the rural areas. Now, we
cannot resolve these issues unless we act in partnership and unless we act
in concert - this means the trade union movement, business, Government and
broad civil society structures.

It is in all our interest that we move decisively in the direction in which
we create far greater opportunities for our young people not only to find
jobs, but also to enrol in the learnership programmes that will be rolled
out. It would be instructive to note that one of the decisions taken at the
Growth and Development Summit was to intensify the campaign to enrol young
people in the learnership campaigns that are going to take place.

The issue of unemployment is not a matter just of young people getting a
job, but it also has to do with the dignity of young people. Therefore,
it's quite critical that all of us, and especially those of us who sit in
this House, act together and act in partnership to do something about this.


There is no doubt that the youth of South Africa is not apolitical, that
the youth of South Africa is not disinterested in what happens to their
country. The youth of South Africa is not disinterested in what happens on
the African continent. The question is: Do we have the capacity to work
with our young people? It would also be important for all of us, again
across the political spectrum in this House, to intensify the campaign to
ensure that every young person gets an ID card. Having got an ID card, they
should register to vote. On election day, they should go and cast their
votes.

Now, of course, some of the opposition parties might not be very much
interested in this because they are afraid that the overwhelming majority
of young people are not going to vote for them. [Laughter.] But, in the
hope that maybe a teeny-weeny section of the youth will vote for them, it
is still in their interest to get people registered for their ID cards and
registered to vote.

Madam Speaker, you told us about the declaration that you've received on
behalf of all of us. In conclusion, let me quote to you the conclusion of
that declaration. It says:


  We, the youth of South Africa, live in a unique country. Our challenges
  are many and complex. Our people are diverse and expectant. Our dreams
  are beautiful and melancholic. Our history is tragic and inspired. Our
  future is literally in our hands. We need a continued rebirth of hope and
  unity to regain and fulfil our dreams. We in the National Youth Assembly
  pledge to support all efforts by our Government to declare war on poverty
  and underdevelopment, to combat racism and imperialism. We are determined
  in our resolve to ensure that never again will youth be the subject of
  marginalisation and exploitation. We believe that our Government
  understands the assertion that: "One measure of a progressive state is
  the way it treats its youth."

I hope all of us understand that measure. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr S D MONTSITSI: Madam Speaker, we shall forever be indebted to the youth
of this country for giving us permission, through the National Youth
Commission, to speak - that is, myself and the hon Minister Pahad.

You have to realise that almost every year, they actually give us
permission. As I said, we are very happy and highly indebted to them. As we
celebrate the 27th anniversary of youth mass action and achievement across
the country, we should pause and salute the gallant fighters and icons of
the youth movement like Ephraim Mogale, Siphiwe Mthimkhulu, Peter Mokaba
and many others.

I wish to draw a parallel with regard to how the youth of 1976 were treated
by the apartheid government and the respect that the present youth have
gained both from their Government and communities. The late former
president of the African National Congress, Comrade Oliver Tambo, said, and
I quote:


  A nation that does not value its youth, does not deserve a future.

The establishment and the location of the National Youth Commission in The
Office of the Presidency speaks volumes about how the present Government
espouses and cherishes the aspirations of young people in South Africa.
This particular gesture and statement is intended to declare to the world
and country at large that never again will the youth of this country be
treated like scum, baggage or animals. The fact that the new South Africa
invests in its youth as the youth is the future.

Apartheid subjected us to torture and death in detention, massive fire
power on students who were unarmed. On Wednesday, 16 June 1976, we turned
out in our thousands, pounding the dirty streets of Soweto with one
resounding voice: Scrap Afrikaans as a medium of instruction - not as a
language - abolish Bantu education and away with apartheid. The peaceful
student march was met with brutal force as volleys of bullets rained on
unarmed students.

Instead of breaking the spirit and instilling fear in the youth, the
resolve to fight on and defy the might of apartheid went from strength to
strength. This day set the pace and foundation for youth activities and
mobilisation to flourish from the 70s right up to the 90s. Let me share
with the youth and the country some of the most horrific experiences we
have gone through.

In August 1976, I was marching alongside a fellow SRC member from Jabulane
Technical School. His name was Douglas. As we were leading the march
towards New Canada Station, marching to town, the police opened fire and
followed up with teargas. I turned and fled, leaving Douglas behind.

At a safe distance I turned and looked for him. I saw him carrying an
injured schoolgirl in his arms, with police surrounding him. He was put
inside the police van with the rest of the youth who were overcome by
teargas and could not run. When he was released, he told me that the girl
he was carrying had had a gaping wound in her stomach and that her
intestines were falling freely out of her body. Douglas did the best he
could to push them back. The girl died in his arms in the police van.

These are actions of the government of the past and the horrors of
apartheid. Now that we are free and the youth of this country have the
right to vote, the obstacles that impede youth from being able to carry
identity documents should actually be removed.

The National Youth Commission gives clear statistics regarding voter
registration in 1999 amongst youth. The lowest rate emerged amongst those
age between 18 and 20 years. The lowest percentages amongst provinces in
terms of registration by youth is Kwa-Zulu Natal with 38% registration, and
the Eastern Cape and the Northern Province with 43% each. Gauteng and the
Western Cape showed at least an improvement of 62%.

We therefore call for a massive campaign amongst the young people of South
Africa to ensure that they acquire identity documents in order to come and
vote in large numbers. Despite the challenges which are confronting the
current youth, there are sterling successes which ought to be applauded.

First, the Umsobomvu Fund is funding a project in North West's Atamelang
township where about 80 youths under the joint enrichment programme
established three municipal food gardens to sustain production and earn
income for themselves and for 500 community pensioners, some of whom are
ill and disabled. They also assist their community with Lifeline
counselling - this is the youth that was supposed to be lost and out of
direction or out of step.

In partnership with the National Youth Commission, the State Information
and Technology Agency is helping graduates find jobs to increase the
country's IT capability. Two-hundred-and-thirty graduates will be exposed
to life skills training, case management and work experience. These
graduates will be absorbed into the Public Service armed with high level IT
skills to enhance the quality of work within the Public Service.

Those who are sceptical about our youth should pause and think about the
abundance of loyalty and patriotism that drove Sibusiso Vilane to climb the
8 000 m height of Mount Everest and reach the summit on 26 May 2003. He had
this to say to the youth of South Africa and the world over:


   Putting my feet on the summit made me feel great. Africans can do
   everything. Nothing can stop us, as long as we prepare properly.

[Applause.] Coming to the declaration which has just been handed to you,
Madam Speaker, let us remember that the youth, on the 21st anniversary of
16 June, have the theme which they called: Nonracialism, a youth vision for
the 21st century. This shows that the youth are prepared, still, to reach
out to the youth of other nationalities.

In the past, however, this is what used to happen. The apartheid museum has
information on its walls about what they refer to as the chameleon dance.
Most nationalities of South Africa were displaced. The census of that time
showed that 702 coloureds were displaced and became white; 19 whites became
coloured; one Indian became white; three Chinese became white; 50 Indians
became coloured; 43 coloureds became Indian; two blacks became other
Asians; one black became Griqua; 11 coloureds became Chinese; and one
Chinese became coloured; but no black became white and no white became
black. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Madam Speaker, every nation puts its faith in its future
on the promise of its youth. Consequently, every nation devotes every
effort in nurturing, guiding and supporting its youth. Leaders take
responsibility to protect and invest in our country's future, making every
necessary sacrifice and committing every available resource to this
essential task to secure a better future for coming generations.

A nation that fails in this is doomed to blunder into the future without
vision, without direction. Failure to adopt a bold vision of a future with
great promise will destroy any hopes young people may hold, creating an
ideal environment for self-destructive juvenile delinquency.

South Africa, unfortunately, is burdened with a mediocre Government that
stumbles forward without vision or direction, providing ineffective
piecemeal solutions ... [Interjections] ... a Government in breach of its
obligations, deliberately manipulating organs of state for its own sake, to
the detriment of our youth. To this Government, our future is not
important. [Interjections.]

Sadtu's right to strike when a teacher is disciplined for poor service
seems more important to Government than the future of our children. What
future can we expect if only 40% of scholars complete matric, which is the
basic requirement for young people to develop? What future can we expect?
While Sadtu is satisfied, our nation loses precious potential, which is the
very essence of our future. Imagine the deep disillusionment of a young
person who does pass matric when he or she learns that only one in ten
matriculants will get an opportunity to develop further. How heart-
wrenching it must be to have your dreams destroyed; the dreams promised by
an education so brutally betrayed.

Yet it is more important to Government to satisfy the demands of Cosatu at
the Growth and Development Summit than to ensure our youth's future.
[Interjections.] An opportunity to secure the future by committing
substantial resources for investment in our youth and making radical
changes necessary to drastically improve their prospects for employment was
squandered. What a shame.

The ruling party looked after its own youth league through the
establishment of the National Youth Commission. It seems more important to
the ANC to decide who will be in a position to buy a silk shirt or Italian
shoes with taxpayer's money than it is to honestly face substance abuse,
gang violence and teenage pregnancies, all of which threaten our future.
Face those issues. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

It is more important for Government to defend the indefensible and protect
the President's standing than it is to save the lives of young people, and
that's a fact. HIV/Aids will have claimed 620 000 young, bright and
talented South Africans by the end of this month. Ironically, it's the
month of the youth. Yet, no comprehensive antiretroviral treatment
programme has been put on the table and made available to young people in
this country. Why not? [Interjections.]

We do not have to imagine the impact this will have on our future. We can
already see it in the number of young professionals who die every day, not
to mention the burden placed on many young people who have become
responsible for their families before they've had an opportunity to fully
develop. [Interjections.]

Let me offer you an alternative vision for young South Africans, a vision
where young people do not suffer the indignity of begging money from the
meagre pensions of their grandmothers, where young people leave schools
with the skills required by employers, and the opportunity to develop those
and new skills further through skills transfer and training.
[Interjections.]

Last week's Growth and Development Summit finally committed to increase the
number of learnerships offered to unskilled and unemployed people from 23
000 to 72 000. Besides its being primarily a commitment by business and not
Government, it is also a mere drop in the ocean, compared to the 8 million
unemployed young people in our country today. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

It is also nothing compared to the 4,5 million opportunity vouchers that
the DA would provide for learnerships and skills development over five
years. This would amount to 4,5 million job opportunities. [Interjections.]
[Applause.] This is a credible vision of a better future in which young
people can believe. This is a vision, a vision where international donors
queue up to replenish the Umsobomvu Fund because, after five years, it has
already distributed nearly R1 billion to so many successful young people
and job creation projects throughout the country, a vision where young
people's lives aren't cut short, where children do not lose their parents
and families, do not ...

Mr M T GONIWE: Madam Speaker, is it in order for the hon member to confuse
young people? [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! That is a spurious point of order. Please continue, hon
member.

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Thank you, Madam Speaker. This is a vision where young
people's lives aren't cut short, where children do not lose their parents
and families, do not lose their breadwinners to the scourge of Aids,
because those parents and breadwinners would have had access to life-saving
antiretroviral treatment. [Applause.]

Seldom has a nation had the opportunity to start over as we had, nearly ten
years ago. How criminal is it that we have squandered such a golden
opportunity. In the past decade, we have seen Government systematically
betray the youth, time and time again. We say this: Government's
celebration of June 16 has become a hollow one because there is nothing to
celebrate for the unemployed young people of our country, for those young
people who have Aids and those young people who have left us because of
Aids, because Government does not care.

We only need to look at this declaration to see that there is no mention of
the roll-out of antiretrovirals to save lives. The Government does not
care. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker and hon members, I'm reminded of a quote by
Shakespeare who once said: ``Many a flower is borne to bloom unseen, and
waste its sweetness on the desert air.''

This is true of many of the talented youth of our country. This afternoon,
I want to say, irrespective of our political and diverse roles within the
Government of this country, we all share a common responsibility, that is,
to address the needs of our young people.

A professor at Wits University, Eddie Webster, points out in a lead
article:


  If you are a young person in South Africa today, about to embark in the
  world, you have to master the English language, which is the language of
  globalisation. You have to master mathematics, you have to be computer
  literate, and you have to find yourself a niche.

What is happening today does not begin nor end at our borders. Yet, South
Africa is experiencing a double transition. Firstly, there is the
transition to a globally competitive economy, while simultaneously
attempting to consolidate democracy at home. Democracy is about respect. It
is about having your voice heard, it is about jobs, it is about food and it
is about power.

We cannot simply create democracy via the Constitution. There has to be the
requisite culture. Very often it is difficult for decision-makers, who are
thrust into the position and have to come up with projects and programmes.
What we should be doing is exposing the youth to a specific culture, a
culture related to democratic practice and concepts. In doing this, we
teach youth the values of respect, tolerance, rights, responsibilities and
ubuntu.

Human instincts are not based on democracy. They are based on having food
to eat. Democracy doesn't mean a thing if people can't eat three times a
day or don't have a job. It is about the ability to survive. Today, the
human calamity faced by the Aids pandemic presents one of the greatest
risks to the youth of the world. This is just one of the many problems.
Democratic nations demonstrate that, indeed, democracy itself does not
guarantee greater social justice. Democracy must be accompanied by
political will and commitment. Therefore, there is also a need to
strengthen the capacity of nations to deliver the tangible benefits of
democracy. We need to move away from the ideological towards the practical.

I'm reminded of the words of Martin Luther King Jnr who said, in 1964, when
accepting the Nobel Peace Prize: ``If peace is our goal, it must be our
way.'' Today, I add: If democracy is our goal, it must be the only way.

Another issue I want to talk about is the increasing number of young people
brought up in nuclear and often dysfunctional families. We don't like
talking about this, but it is a reality. Too many young people have
surrogate parents and communities. What does this mean for them? It means a
life of vigilantism, some joining a gang and trying to emulate some
infamous role model. Part of democracy is an industrialised economy. We
need people who are functional, people who are stable and Government has to
help create the conditions for this.

The central idea to the consolidation of democracy is the idea of social
citizenship. Coupled with this is the right to income, the right to
security and the right to education. The IFP believes that to be a vibrant
democracy, education is the road to travel on. Education is the solid base
on which democracy can be built. There is no other way.

No democracy can exist on ignorance. To pull people out of the abyss of
poverty, education and skills training have to be the helping hand. The
question we need to ask is: What skills are we offering? Are they
productive? Are they accessible? Are they relevant? Youth have to engage in
survivalist strategies, and often, they are imbued with feelings of
insecurity. This creates a loss of self-worth and self-dignity.

It is very easy to lose perspective in a fast-paced world. The challenge is
to foster a culture of education and skills. The protected South African
economy of the past, based on mining and agriculture, is over. Right now,
we are witnessing a challenge, a challenge of international competition,
which is driven by information capitalism and information technology. This
is the challenge for us and for Nepad.

We must inculcate the learning of science and technology. This is non-
negotiable. Here, I just want to add that partnerships - I know the
Minister spoke about partnerships - must be on a broad level. We have to
bring all stakeholders on board.

In the absence of a base level of mathematics and science, unemployment
would be burgeoning. The IFP believes that, through the actions and demands
of young people, history is shaped and circumstances are changed. The youth
must have a vision. Government must have a plan, even if it means refining
and revising our institutions such as the National Youth Commission. Our
challenges are many and complex. Our people are diverse and expectant.

We need to embark on that path. I began with a quotation from Shakespeare,
and I want to end with my version of it: Let not the flowers be wasted. We
owe it to the youth of our country. We need to pledge all our efforts
across party lines to ensure that the youth take their rightful place in
our society. Youth, your age has come. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I was young once. In 1976, I was a young
student. Recently I had the great pleasure of being part of a team in
Parliament, the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of
Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons, and we interviewed
candidates for the National Youth Commission. At this process I could see
the improved quality of our young people. One could see that they live in a
country where the Government is concerned about developmental issues as far
as the youth is concerned.

Two weeks ago, I attended the bi-annual congress of the youth council where
the new executive was elected. Once again, I was impressed with the quality
and the intelligence, but more especially, with the love and patriotism
that burns in the hearts of those young people. They reminded me of myself
and my colleagues in 1976 when we stood against the government then.

When we commemorate 16 June 1976, we need to remember those who made it
possible. We should never forget the youth of 1976, never forget their
commitment and the price they paid and are still paying to make this
freedom that we all are enjoying possible. They scarified their lives,
their education and their future to liberate all of us from oppression and
racial discrimination. To appreciate the role of the youth, one needs to
understand the conditions in this country then.

In the late 1960s, the idea of black consciousness heralded an era of
alternative political awareness in South Africa. A self-empowering,
vibrant, reconstructionist world view emphasised the potential role of
black initiative and responsibility in articulating the power of the
powerless.

Between 1968 and 1976, the black consciousness movement was one
characterised by the most significant developments in South Africa, not
only because of the self-confident protests and rebellion that it
unleashed, but also because of the questions it posed about the nature of
opposition politics in South Africa and its relation to the nature of South
African society. Indeed, blacks in South Africa, in the 1960s, were ready
for an ideology of liberation.

The oppression of apartheid society was overt and blatant. All opposition
had been silenced and institutionalised racism flourished triumphantly.
Centuries of exclusionary practices led to what might be described as the
inferiorisation of blacks. They were portrayed as innately inferior,
accustomed to dehumanised living, sexually promiscuous, intellectually
limited and prone to violence. Blackness symbolised evil, demise, chaos,
corruption and uncleanliness.
Thus, black consciousness emanated from the differential material and
political circumstances in which blacks were situated. Its prime movers in
the early phase were relatively privileged medical students, not workers,
who served as educated articulators of the plight of the unprivileged and
politically excluded. Yet, unlike most medical students elsewhere, many of
them came from working-class backgrounds and were not insulated from the
harsh conditions of their society then. They were joined by other students
on the newly created segregated black campuses where they operated under
severe restrictions.

The youth of the 70s transformed negative attitudes about subordinate
nonwhites into a positive discourse of resistance. It offered psychological
support to oppressed groups by providing a model for positive
identification and sought to alleviate the self-contempt often felt by the
oppressed.

We, therefore, owe a tremendous debt to those young people who gave their
all. Not only did they suffer, but also their children, who are the youth
today, because they were willing to offer themselves to economic
empowerment. Our debt to the youth of 1976 and their children today is not
only a debt that must be paid, it is also an investment in our future as a
nation.

What are some of the problems facing our youth? There is the problem of
youth unemployment. The number of young people who have no skills to offer
is high, but even graduates who can show a certificate cannot find jobs.
There is also growing evidence that HIV/Aids is affecting the youth, ages
14 to 35, more than any other age component of the population. Clearly, the
demands of the new South Africa on young people are more rigorous and less
forgiving of individual shortcomings and early mistakes than was the case
when some of us grew up.

The trends cited above pose difficult challenges for our society,
especially the youth. They suggest South Africa's youth are in trouble.
This would make it an odd time for South Africa to be drifting into a `what
will be will be' attitude towards issues affecting the youth.
We should implement the National Youth Strategy. The vision is the
development of youth through providing a long-term and effective means of
reconstructing South African youth through physical rehabilitation, asset-
building and renewal of community resources and rebuilding the fabric of
communities. The National Youth Strategy will foster a spirit of nation-
building by inculcating a culture of service, a common sense of nationhood
and engendering a new form of patriotism as well as promoting
intergenerational understanding.

In line with this vision, the following are the goals of the National Youth
Strategy: to inculcate a culture of service by supporting the youth to
participate constructively in nation-building, and to inculcate in young
people an understanding of their role in the promotion of civic awareness
and national reconstruction.

Youth Day should be a celebration of the energies and achievements of young
people. South Africa has young people coming from diverse backgrounds with
different talents to offer. Some will be intellectuals and some interested
in sport. Some are from rural areas and some from urban areas. Together
they all can become part of an engine that can achieve excellence and make
this country a prosperous one, and a great place to live in. [[Applause.]

Mr K M MOEKETSE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, comrades and
compatriots, I want to reiterate what the Minister has said: The National
Youth Commission is here to stay. This august House, the very final verdict
and tribunal of our people, joins the nation and young people in particular
in the celebration of the heroic and selfless deeds of the youth of our
country in the transformation of our land.

Ho totobetse hore histori kapa nalane ya naha ena e ngotswe ka madi a
barwetsana le bahlankana, hore re iphumane re le mona moo re leng teng
kajeno. [It is clear that the history of our country was written with the
blood of young women and young men, for us to be where we are today.]

This debate takes place at a time when our country is confronted with the
most difficult challenge of turning the tide against poverty, homelessness,
joblessness and a skewed human resource development base created by the
legacy of apartheid and colonialism.

As we engage in this debate in honour of the heroic deeds of successive
generations of youth, we must equally take stock of the impact our
Government has made on improving the lives of our people and the youth in
particular, and position ourselves for challenges ahead. We do so as the
ANC because of the special place the youth occupies in the centre stage of
democracy, development and growth.

Of the total number of the economically active population, 72% of those who
are unemployed are youth, in particular young women. Research on crime
statistics also point to a scenario where youth are predominant as both the
perpetrators and victims of crime.

The previous government never bothered about the welfare, development and
interests of the majority of youth of this country, in particular the
African youth. Skills training, employment and access to quality sports and
cultural participation was a preserve of the white section of the youth of
this country.

Our detractors, who represent narrow interests of the privileged section of
the youth of this country, would want to convince us this afternoon that
the lives of the youth in this country have moved from bad to worse since
1994. In doing so, they choose to ignore, amongst others, the fact that the
economy of this country had witnessed a downward swing since the 1970s and
the 1980s, culminating at 30% in 1993, thus shedding many jobs.

Our country has never known a culture of human rights before 1994. It is
the ANC Government that has introduced this culture as entrenched in our
Bill of Rights. The supreme law of our country protects and spells out in
clear terms the inalienable rights that should be protected as a matter of
law.

This has resulted in the transformation of the criminal justice system to
be geared towards rehabilitative measures as opposed to punishment with
impunity that always results in the destruction of the self-esteem of the
victims. For the first time, our criminal justice system recognises the
rights of the underaged to learn and not to be mixed with hardcore serious
offenders whilst in custody.

In pursuit of this noble goal of protecting the rights of the youth and
children who are in conflict with the law, our Government has gone the
extra mile to put resources in place to create special facilities for
custody of young people who are in conflict with the law. The establishment
of one-stop centres to assist children or youth who are victims of violent
crimes has not only increased the reporting levels of violence against
children, but further heightened public consciousness around children and
youth's rights.
Many children who are in custody due to being in conflict with the law are
entitled to further their education as a basic right. This helps to
alleviate the social burden when these children or youth are reintegrated
back into society for productive social participation. It is a fact that
when a child grows up in custody and is deprived of the right to learn, by
the time he/she comes back, he/she loses hope in positive social
participation.

We can boldly illustrate how this new system of child justice has
rechannelled the energies of some young offenders who, upon return from
custody, applied their acquired skills to participate meaningfully in
society thus inspiring others to believe that crime does not pay. We
proceed from the understanding and conviction that a child and a youth's
place is not in prison.

Certainly, crimes against the youth and children in particular cannot be
policed. Its prevention resides in the mobilisation and conscientisation of
communities against all sorts of crimes against the youth and children.
Our Government, through outreach and community awareness programmes, has
made a dent in the incidence of crime against children. The fact that the
level of reportage on crimes against the youth and children has risen is a
clear testimony to this reality. Through their active participation in
prison workshops, the youth learn new skills to contribute positively once
they are reunited with society.

The National Youth Commission has been established through an Act of
Parliament in 1996 to champion youth development at the level of policy
formulation by, among other things, interacting with government departments
in the legislative processes to ensure a youth bias. This Act outlines very
clearly what the key competency areas are for this statutory body for youth
development, which are among others, the following: policy research, policy
development and setting of an agenda for youth development and monitoring
of policies of Government in relation to youth development.

It should be clear that some people are deliberately judging the National
Youth Commission on aspects that do not concern its competency areas. The
commission is a policy institution, but it has facilitated some of the
pilot projects which some government departments have taken seriously.
Amongst these are the following: Young Positive-Living Ambassadors, which
is very supportive to young people who are HIV-positive and encourages
positive living. Some government departments, like the Free State health
department, have incorporated the project within their Ministries.

The National Youth Commission and the Land Bank recently launched an
agricultural project in the Northern Cape and Free State in Paul Roux, the
eastern part of the Free State, and this programme will be expanded to
other provinces.

Skills development remains an important project for the youth, which is the
best way of facilitating youth economic participation. The Department of
Labour has set a target of 80 000 learnerships in 2005. It is for the
private sector to play a meaningful role in youth development projects.

On the civil society level, we have the SA Youth Council which continues to
be a central body for non-statutory organisations of South African youth.
This organisation continues to do its work, notwithstanding its financial
position. It commands the support of many youth organisations across the
political and cultural spectrum.

The reality is that many of our young people are graduated to unemployment
and many more are matriculated to unemployment too. This, in the main,
continues to impact on the majority of our youth in particular because of
deliberate programmes of the past which were meant to dehumanise us.

Some challenges are that we need a deliberate effort to find the best way
of making the youth of our country participants in the economy and this can
only be done by clear preferential policies under the spirit of the Black
Economic Empowerment agenda, supported by both the public and private
sector.

The Umsobomvu Fund, as part of the agreements of the 1998 Presidential Job
Summit, was set up to assist in the creation of youth entrepreneurship. To
date, approximately R1 billion has been raised. However, R1 billion is
still not enough to address our problems of unemployment, given the
matriculation of tens of thousands of our youth who cannot be absorbed by
both our higher education systems and the job market.

There is no doubt that the ANC-led Government inherited a huge backlog in
1994. There was high unemployment and the economy has been in recession for
some years and was structurally defective. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Adv Z L MADASA: Speaker, my speech is about remembering the late Mr Xolile
Musi, a friend of mine, with whom I struggled and who was killed in 1976 on
the day we went to enquire about our leader at Langa Police Station.

As the ACDP we are calling upon the youth and say that they should not sit
back while things are happening. This country is where it is today because
of the youth of 1944, 1976 and the 1980s that were such a strong movement
that eventually led to the change that we see today. I want to encourage
the youth to thinK creatively and start initiating things. Jobs are scarce
and there will not be any more. Wherever they are, the youth need to get
together and form an organisation just like the organisation I am going to
read about today.

I received an invitation from a youth organisation called Saki Macozoma
Male Voices Entertaining for Tourists from Port Elizabeth. On 16 June 2003
they will be hosting a Youth Day Festival. This is what they say about
themselves, and I quote:]


  The festival will showcase the talented youth, the young people around
  metro involving traditional dance, gospel, choral music and the young
  people of Enkuselweni proving themselves that they are part of the
  community with pantsula jive, gumboots dance and lots of entertainment
  from them with the help of the Saki Macozoma male voices.

This is an example of young people who have taken the initiative and
started up something where they live. I am issuing this warning to all
youth and cautioning them that if they wait for the Government to do things
for them, they will go hungry. Wake up, stand up wherever you are, get
together and form an organisation and start a small enterprise and speak to
the Government, go to companies and come to parties such as ours. Choose
carefully though, and do not join just any party. Look at the leadership of
the party and what it stands for. [Applause.]]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Deputy Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, someone once
said, "Youth is wasted on the young." In South Africa, it is too often the
case that our youth never get a proper opportunity to be young.
Unemployment, poverty and the death of parents due to HIV/Aids are but some
of the pervasive challenges that force young people into lives of hardship
and suffering.

When we speak of the youth seizing the opportunities of democracy, it rings
a hollow note for many of our young people who cannot, no matter how
desperately they wish to, find these opportunities in order to seize them.
A recent shocking revelation has indicated the extremely poor levels of
literacy among Grade 3 pupils. What opportunities will these young people
be able to seize later in life?

By far the biggest challenge facing the youth is the unemployment crisis in
South Africa. Of the more than 4 million unemployed adults in the country,
the vast majority are younger than 30. In fact, every year, hundreds of
thousands of young people matriculate and enter a job market that is unable
to provide most of them with employment opportunities.

If we want to do something for the youth then we must address the
unemployment crisis. Nice parliamentary speeches do not change their
reality. The sad truth is that many young people are beginning to lose
faith in this democracy that does not provide them with opportunities,
which is why so many young people did not participate in the past election.
This is a warning signal of growing discontent among our young people and
we dare not ignore this warning.

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, the FF believes that politics is
always about the future. The youth is the future of a country. In politics
we make decisions today that will affect people tomorrow. Today we are
debating ``Youth action to seize the opportunities of democracy''.

The opportunities in South Africa are unlimited. What a beautiful country
with room and opportunities for everybody. But why are so many young people
leaving South Africa?

Ek wil vir u voorlees uit 'n brief van 'n jong dame, en ek haal aan:


  Ek is 'n jong Afrikaner in exile. Ek woon en werk in 'n vreemde land, nie
  omdat ek van benede vriespuntweer hou, graag in oorvol moltreine ry of
  verkies om 'n vreemde taal te praat nie. Ek is hier omdat my vaderland
  nie meer vir my 'n toekoms bied nie. Dit maak my bitter en die duiwel in.
  Ons jongmense kan maar geoffer word. Ons kan maar regstellende aksie en
  die gevolge daarvan aanvaar, maar ons moet net nie branders maak nie. Die
  prys wat betaal moet word, is glo as gevolg van die ``legacy of
  apartheid''. Maar ons in die vreemde het boggerol te doen gehad met
  apartheid. Meeste van ons was skaars gebore toe die ANC ontban is. Op die
  oomblik is ek 'n wéreldburger en verdien ek goeie buitelandse geld, maar
  as ek kon kies, sou ek eerder wou huistoe kom. Maak dit asseblief vir my
  moontlik. Gee 'n plan.

Die VF sê daar is 'n plan om hierdie jong mense weer opgewonde oor Suid-
Afrika en die toekoms te maak. Artikel 9 van ons Grondwet bepaal dat almal
gelyk is. Daar mag nie teenoor 'n persoon gediskrimineer word op grond van
ras, geslag of etniese afkoms nie. Hoekom word dan teen hierdie jongmense
gediskrimineer? Omdat artikel 9(2) bepaal dat daar wel omrede regstellende
aksie gediskrimineer mag word.

Die VF stel voor dat ons hierdie kwalifikasie in die Grondwet verander en
die jeug vrystel van regstellende aksie. Die VF het so 'n grondwetlike
wysiging voorgestel. Om watter rede moet daar steeds teen hulle
gediskrimineer word en vir hoe lank nog? U sal verbaas wees om te sien
watter bydrae hierdie jongmense vir Suid-Afrika se toekoms sal maak, as
hulle vir hulself weer geleenthede en hoop sien ná so 'n wysiging. Ek dank
u. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to read to you from a letter by a young woman, and I quote:

The FF says that there is a plan to make these young people excited about
South Africa and the future again. Section 9 of our Constitution provides
that everyone is equal. No person may be discriminated against on the basis
of race, gender, ethnic origin. Why then are these young people being
discriminated against? Because section 9(2) provides that there may in fact
be discrimination because of affirmative action.

The FF proposes that we change this qualification in the Constitution and
free the youth from affirmative action. The FF proposed such a
constitutional amendment. For what reason must they still be discriminated
against and for how much longer? You would be surprised to see what
contribution these young people would make to South Africa's future, if
they saw opportunities and hope for themselves again after such an
amendment. I thank you. [Interjections.]]

Mme M A SEECO: Modulasetilo, maloko a a fano a a tlotlegang, UCDP ya re go

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, hon members present, the UCDP says that the
youth of South Africa should strive to live like the five fingers of a
hand. Knowing their culture will allow our youth to act like children when
they are supposed to. They should reflect a huge responsibility, like the
middle finger, and be adults who are responsible, like the ring finger. The
next finger shows the strength is fading. The thumb shows wisdom.]

The youth face a number of challenges in South Africa. Amongst others, they
are confronted with the challenges of unemployment, poverty, health-related
issues such as HIV/Aids, lack of skills, and lack of information that would
enable them to make informed decisions about their lives.

With the ushering in of democracy in 1994, the youth was seen as a vital
resource for the country. Without them, there can be no future. They are
the centre of reconstruction and development. Against this backdrop, this
brief will consider the opportunities offered by the National Youth
Commission and the Umsobomvu Fund to assist young people to overcome the
challenges that they continue to face.

There are approximately 17,5 million youth between the ages of 14 and 35 in
South Africa, of whom three-fifths are unemployed. According to Statistics
South Africa's Labour Force Survey, there are a total of 31,22% unemployed
people between the ages of 15 and 24, and 40,17% unemployed between the
ages of 25 and 34. The youth thus make up the largest number of the
unemployed.

The NYC was established to address the problems and challenges facing young
men and women in South Africa. Its mandates which are set out in the Act
include, firstly, implementing measures to redress the imbalances of the
past relating to various forms of disadvantages suffered by young people
generally, and secondly, maintaining close liaison with institutions,
bodies or authorities similar to the NYC so that common policies and
practices can be established to promote co-operation.

The NYC's HIV/Aids programme is an outreach programme that ensures that the
interest, awareness and participation of youth are central in the fight
against HIV/Aids. It is premised on the principle of positive living. The
main goal of the project is to promote acceptance and care of young people
who are living with HIV/Aids and to prevent the further spread of HIV,
particularly among young people. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Madam Speaker, a great welcome goes to the young people of
South Africa, our future. [Applause.]

The hon Da Camara said that the ANC Government is mediocre. We are actually
giants. The world comes here to learn the various aspects of governance and
change. The DA are giants of destruction of what we are trying to build.
[Applause.]

You said that there are no jobs for young people and there is a lack of
education. You forget that we have inherited a faulty economy from your
predecessors. You choose to ignore the fact that, to date, we are still
servicing an apartheid debt. The bulk of our GDP goes towards servicing
this debt. But besides this, the bulk of our national Budget goes to
education. This is what you should tell the youth.

Every single year from 1994 to date, we have been spending most of our
Budget on education, and incrementally so. Your previous government taught
our youth to be clerks, police, nurses and teachers. We have now opened the
door for them to be anything they want to be. The future is in their hands.
[Applause.]

You cannot be the custodian of the future of our youth. You cannot. Anybody
who fills our youth with wrong and negative messages is the enemy of their
future. Psychologists, politicians and parents know that in raising and
nurturing the youth, one should always fills one's children with positive
messages, not negative ones. [Applause.]

Young people of South Africa, you are beneficiaries of democracy and
freedom. This democracy was fought for with blood, tears, sweat and life
itself. You should not take this democracy for granted but should value it.
It has created opportunities and they should be seized. The youth are a
national asset and our pride. The ANC-led Government loves the youth, and
so do the people of South Africa because we know botlhale jwa phala bo tswa
phalaneng. [children can give good advice to their parents].

The youth are appreciated and are encouraged to do and achieve whatever
they want to. They have the ability and the capability. They can. The youth
are the inheritors of the future and they should prepare for it now. The
ANC-led Government has opened doors for them and they should respond
accordingly and positively.

We have solicited funds for the youth. Some people have already mentioned
the Umsobomvu Fund, Khula and Ntsika. The funds should be approached by the
youth and made to work for them. We have created structures such as the
National Youth Council and the National Youth Commission and anybody who
shoots down these structures is the enemy of the future of the youth. These
structures should be defended as they were put in place by them to serve
the youth. They should be made to work and they should be defended with all
that they have.

The media and those who do not like the future of the youth keep on saying
that the youth are apathetic. I disagree. Like Mandela and his comrades in
1952, the youth are the main force in the Letsema and voluntarism campaign.
They are in our police stations and police reserves. They are in old age
homes and schools, in public service and doing home-based care. We are
proud of the youth. The youth are involved in national life. [Applause.]

The future is in the hands of the youth ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, may I request that we stop the
whistling. Let us please observe some decorum in the House! Please proceed,
hon member.

Ms M P MENTOR: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The youth must learn and take
their education seriously. The youth must prepare for the future now. The
youth is the present and the future.

Anton Lembede, Kenneth Kaunda, Patrice Lumumba, Kwame Nkrumah, Nelson
Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and Thabo Mbeki all started when they
were young. They did not wait until they were members of Parliament to come
here and critique what we are trying to build.

The youth must learn from their books, communities of the struggle for
freedom of South Africans, Guinea-Bissau, Congo, Ghana, Mozambique, Angola
and Zimbabwe, Nicaragua, Chile and Vietnam. They should draw lessons from
Frelimo, MK, MPLA and SWAPO. [Applause.]

We are proud of our youth and they in return should be proud of themselves.
We love our youth. They should love themselves. The media and opposition
say that the youth are apathetic to a point that they do not care about
their future and they will not vote. The youth should go and get their
ID's, register and vote correctly for people who have the youth's interest,
wellbeing and development at heart. [Applause.]

The youth should assist other young people to obtain their IDs and
register. They should insist that their schools, universities, churches and
public servants assist. The youth should demand that public servants,
whether they work for Home Affairs or not, assist in this process. This is
very important. The vote of the youth, like them, is very special and
important.

The lives of the youth are precious and they should ensure that they do not
contract HIV/Aids. They should join the youth brigades for HIV/Aids that
are proposed. We ask that working young people should donate one day's wage
into the coffers of youth development, as agreed upon last weekend at the
Growth and Development Summit. We know that the youth will heed that call.

We are proud of our young people in rural areas, townships, cities and on
farms. They have what it takes, and the power and future is in their hands.
We call on the youth to fight gender-based violence, rape and child abuse.
Some youth have physical disabilities but they have power within
themselves. Some are intellectuals and can make a difference and
contribute. Some are unemployed or out of school but this Government has
created learnerships for the youth. These should be seized.

Business and government departments should be approached in order to obtain
learnerships so that they can earn and make a difference to the economy and
the lives of our people. This Government should be assisted by the youth to
push back the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

In conclusion, Kwame Nkrumah, in quoting William Wordsworth, my favourite
poet, said in 1961, when he opened the assembly for the first time in
Ghana:


  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
  But to be young was very heaven.

I am saying to young South Africans that it is bliss for them to be living
in this era that this ANC Government and the heroic struggle of our people
has created for them, but that it is heaven for them to be young.

The youth should seize the opportunities that have been created for them.
They should believe in themselves, just as we believe in them. We trust
them and therefore they should be trustworthy. We rely on them and they
should be self-reliant. The power is in their hands and they should not
listen to anybody who says the youth are useless and apathetic. The power
is in their hands. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Deputy Speaker, June 16 is a red letter day in the history
of our struggle for the liberation of our country.

It is therefore important, on this day, to remember the South African
Student Organisation and its leaders who rebelled against Nusas and made
history, which resulted in the Black Consciousness Movement led by our
martyrs such as Onkgopotse Tiro, Steve Biko and hundreds of others. The
secret trial of 18 PAC leaders at Bethal, such as Zephania Mothopeng, John
Ganya and many others, must also be noted. They were sentenced to a total
of 162 years for the Soweto uprising and so-called terrorism.

The best thing that can be done for our youth today is to provide them with
free education. [Applause.] They cannot seize any opportunities for
democracy when the vast majority of them find it difficult to acquire
education and technical skills.

A nation which perpetually depends on outsiders for skills is not a healthy
nation. A nation which retrenches teachers and has only 40% of its students
writing matric is committing national suicide. [Applause.]

A very high price was paid for the future of our youth on 16 June, 1976 and
through the imprisonment of freedom fighters, like Zephania Mothopeng. That
suffering, that service, that sacrifice was meant to give our youth a
bright and glorious future. [Applause.] Their future is bleak without
education and jobs. [Interjections.]

Let us pay tribute to all our martyrs who fell on June 16, 1976 by invoking
the spirit of ...

... uphaqa njengelanga, inyathi yasenhlakanhlakeni,  unokuzil' ukudla
kwamagwala.
Amagwal' adl' ububende, uLanga phum' endlwin' yendlovu.
Nyakambe liye kuphuma kweyengonyama.
Impunzi kaNdaba bayibambe ngeendlebe, yadlamka, yadl' amadoda. Uguqadele.
Lefatshe la rona. [Our world.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The most crucial stage in
a child's life is his or her primary socialisation. The apartheid era had
moulded its youth to continue in gruesome segregation and today, with the
onset of democracy, our status of democratic values should be administered
into a child's upbringing.

Children are influenced by circumstances around them. Their mindsets are
greatly influenced by the environment of upbringing. It is therefore
crucial for parents and guardians to instil democratic values in their
children's development.

As the future of our country, democratic values circumscribed by our
national Constitution should form part of our school curriculum. This
encourages the continuous democracy of South Africa. Schools should invest
in programmes that involve their students in mock democracies that will
equip them with values to be practised in the future.

It is sad to note that discrimination is evident at a number of educational
institutes, which the MF firmly despises. The recent segregation in sport
by the AVS's ``Bokkieweek'' is one of those. The MF feels that freedom to
practise should be upheld but definitely not the freedom to exclude. It is
discriminatory.

We as political parties also have a major role to play in involving our
youth in democracy. Youth programmes and youth leagues should be embarked
on as a duty to our youth and the future of South Africa. Youth input and
discussions should be encouraged on a number of government issues and, in
turn, youth comment should be given valid attention.

The MF feels seriously that school curriculums should encourage government
issues for debate. This would contribute to our youth seizing the
opportunities of democracy as our future leaders. Thank you, Madam Deputy
Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, thanks go to the previous speaker who calmed
down the audience. [Interjections.]

Agb Speaker, die nuwe vryhede en geleenthede wat vir ons jeug oopgegaan
het, bring ook verantwoordelikhede mee, wat, indien nie reg bestuur word
nie, 'n ontredderde en ontnugterde jong geslag tot gevolg gaan hê.

Kyk maar na die meeste oorsese rolprente en meestal vind jy so 'n klein
mannetjie van so tien twaalf jaar wat die hele gesin om sy pinkie draai.
Vind jy ouers wat gereeld om verskoning vra omdat hulle die fyn besnaarde
klein wesentjie kwansuis weer verkeerd opgevryf het. Net om te sien hoe hy
hulle in 'n volgende rondte weer gaan manipuleer. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Mev die Speaker, dis nie die tipe jeug wat Suid-Afrika nodig het nie.
Hollywood verskaf nie die rolmodelle vir ons jong mense nie. Ons sal dit
self doen. By al die geleenthede wat ons jeug kan gee, bly die heel
belangrikste, 'n geborge omgewing, 'n soliede waardesisteem en 'n stabiele
gesinslewe. Ons jeug het vleuels nodig om die nuwe vryhede te verken, maar
hulle het ook ankers nodig om nie reddeloos rond te dobber nie.

Ons soek jongmense met inisiatief, wat geleenthede skep en aangryp, wat hul
vryheid kan geniet, maar in hul eie belang, ook jongmense wat in
verantwoordelikheid daarmee kan omgaan, wat bouers word en nie brekers nie.

Daarom, agb Speaker, sal dit altyd vir my onaanvaarbaar bly dat Jeugdag in
Suid-Afrika gekoppel word aan 'n dag van opstand en rebellie. Dis nie die
sein wat ons van en vir ons jeug moet uitstuur nie. Gedenk die bydrae van
die jeug tot die struggle, as u wil, maar moet dit nie verbind aan Jeugdag
vir al die jongmense in Suid-Afrika nie. Ons soek nie ons jeug in optogte
en in massa-aksies nie. Ons soek hulle op ons sportvelde. Ons soek hulle
agter hulle boeke. Ons soek hulle in konsertsale en op die verhoë.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Speaker, the new freedoms and opportunities that have opened up for
our youth also carry responsibilities, which if not managed properly, could
result in a damaged and disillusioned younger generation.

Just look at most of the overseas films, and you will mostly find a young
boy of about ten or twelve who twists the entire family around his little
finger. You will find parents regularly apologising because they have
apparently rubbed the highly strung small being up the wrong way again.
Only to see how he manipulates them again in the next round.
[Interjections.]

Madam Speaker, this is not the type of youth that South Africa needs.
Hollywood does not provide role models for our young people. We will do it
ourselves. Of all the opportunities that we can provide our youth, the most
important remains a secure environment, a solid value system and a stable
family life. Our youth needs wings to explore these new freedoms, but they
also need anchors in order not to drift about aimlessly.

We are looking for young people with initiative, who can create
opportunities and seize them, who can enjoy their freedom, but for their
own good, also youth who can deal with that responsibly, who will become
builders and not destroyers.

Therefore, hon Speaker, it will always remain unacceptable to me that Youth
Day in South Africa is associated with a day of uprising and rebellion.
This is not the signal that we should send out of and for our youth.
Commemorate the contribution of the youth to the struggle, if you want to,
but do not associate it with Youth Day for all of the youth of South
Africa. We do not want our youth in marches and mass action. We want them
on our sports grounds. We want them behind their books. We want them in
concert halls and on stages.]

Lastly, Madam Speaker, our topic speaks of the opportunities of democracy
for our youth. Let us also do something about those thousands of young
people for whom opportunities have been closed through affirmative action.
Give them hope as well through a new deal that will not address the lack of
past opportunities by depriving a new generation of those very
opportunities. I thank you. [Interjections.]

Mrs L MALONEY: Madam Deputy Speaker, before I start, I want to warn the
speakers of the opposition parties that they should ignore their senior
members and co-operate with the youth in the country. They are aware that
their seniors are about to be recycled. [Laughter.]

At the end of the 10 year regime of B J Vorster, the longest of any
Nationalist Prime Minister, and after 28 years of apartheid rule, the
students of Soweto and other parts of South Africa later, with dustbin lids
and stones, rose up against the imposition of Bantu education. B J Vorster
characterised this uprising as the worst crisis the National Party
government ever faced since it came to power. The National Liberation
Movement, led by the ANC on the other side characterised this development
in the following way: ``Soweto closed the debate about the legitimacy of
armed struggle.''

From then on, all those who supported the struggle against apartheid, at
home and abroad, agreed that there was no other avenue open to the
oppressed other than the pursuit of armed struggle. We all said that the
march to freedom must be intensified with greater speed and determination.

It is not my intention here, Madam Deputy Speaker, to dwell on the history
of this glorious generation of youth. I, however, would like to say that,
despite all efforts of repression, brutality, torture, exile and
imprisonment, the resilience of all people of South Africa made South
Africa a free and democratic country. [Applause.]

We salute the youth of South Africa, the generation of Soweto and I
dedicate my speech to this youth in particular, the young women of 16 June,
who dared all to be counted in the roll call of heroes of our country. We
are today able to stand at this podium as free and proud people, thanks to
the tenacity and sacrifices of many young people of South Africa.

To me and many African women who faced triple oppression, oppressed as a
class, a nation and also on the basis of gender, it is a celebration that
we have rightly taken our place in this august House. We salute in
particular the ANC, whose visionary policies allowed for a quota of women
to be in its list. We come here, as women, not out of favour, but because
we are taking our deserved places in the seats of Parliament. There are
many parties, like the DP, who do not understand these revolutionary
policies that help in breaking the bondage of gender oppression and
ensuring that the place of a woman is in the struggle.

Many of us as women and as parents have sacrificed by leaving our children
and our homes, confident that our participation in this House would enhance
many of the ideals we stand for, in particular, the rights of the child,
the rights of women and a better life for all.

The central challenge of the youth of 1976 was that of a better education
system and better skills for black people. As I stand here, I do so with
pride, because this House led by the ANC under the visionary leadership of
former president Nelson Mandela and the current President, Comrade Thabo
Mbeki, has not failed our children and youth.

The education system today is taking in strides in realising its objective
of a better and quality education. It is now designed to produce a youth
that is able to think critically and better equipped to meet the skills and
challenges of today.

Our children are better placed today to enjoy opportunities and protections
that were not available in the past. Child support grants and other social
security programmes are issues the poor warmly welcome and celebrate.

I must quickly salute the President for convening a successful Growth and
Development Summit. Even those who sat on the sidelines wishing for the
collapse of the GDS have been left utterly disappointed. The GDS was a
resounding success.

For the youth and poor in particular, the resolutions of the GDS will help
to consolidate hope and confidence that our Government is serious when it
talks of a better life for all. The practical resolution on creating jobs,
encouraging entrepreneurship through, inter alia, expanded public works
programmes, youth brigades, training programmes and broadening skills bases
are things that we applaud.

The question of youth development is not just about the youth, but also
about the development of the whole nation and investment in the future.
This is the core of national development and at the centre stage of all
efforts of communities and sections of our society.

This issue of youth development seeks to counteract the effects of our
past, which saw deliberate racial marginalisation of the majority of our
youth, in particular the African youth. This is an attempt to address the
developmental backlog, which I think should have, as its cornerstone,
education and training.

The second question is the National Youth Service which seeks to find ways
and means to respond rapidly to youth employment, deficit in skills and
meaningful youth participation in the economy. We celebrate in particular
the resolution on National Youth Service, because it is part and parcel of
addressing issues of a generation who, though they were in the majority in
the fight for a better South Africa, continue to be a statistic in issues
of unemployment.

Even though these programmes may not offer full employment, we however
agree that they will contribute greatly to the programme of gaining work
experience, which in turn will increase employability of the youth. Those
who get this temporary employment will also get subsistence income which in
turn will contribute in the struggle to push back the frontiers of poverty.

As a woman activist of the ANC, I am indeed proud that my organisation has
risen to the challenges of the day. These programmes, I am certain, will
help in building the confidence and morale of the youth. Never again should
we speak of the lost generation. To us in the ANC, it was never a lost
generation, but a generation that sacrificed its future for South Africa to
be free.

We are free today and we can stand here as members of Parliament because of
the sweat, the blood and the class of 1976. In the struggle to push back
the frontiers of poverty, there is no room for wailers and complainers,
like these ones. The critical call to all of us is to put our shoulders to
the wheel and advance to development and prosperity.

We should all emulate the spirit of Solomon Mahlangu, Ashley Kriel, Peter
Mokaba, Parks Mankahlana and many others who have passed on. Theirs was a
celebrated life and selfless service to the people of South Africa. We once
again shout, ``Long Live June 16''!

But, before I end my speech, I  want  to  talk  about  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Deputy Speaker, as the new kid on the block, I am very
very delighted indeed to participate in this debate.

It is very clear that the opportunities that democracy afford our youth
really amount to their taking control over their own affairs politically.
That is why the mission of the party that I am now working with and that I
have for myself in politics is to ensure that young people come into
politics so that they begin to understand how our democracy works, and how
our parliamentary system works.

I am very delighted that this afternoon we have 40 to 50 such young people
who are here where they are beginning to realise that South Africa is the
most beautiful country in the world. It's a country that affords them the
opportunities to remain here, to seize the opportunities and to begin to
become politically active. By ensuring that we develop the skills of
leadership, and the way in which parliamentary politics work, we can
guarantee this country that a future supply of capable and dedicated young
leaders will be there for them to do what they think will be necessary to
take our country forward.

This, to my mind, is the best way we should be working. We are also going
out on the campaign that ours is a proposition party, not an opposition
party. [Applause.] Though we will sit on the opposition benches, we will
come to this Parliament with concrete proposals and good ideas so that if
the ANC has brewed good coffee, we will not pour that coffee down the drain
but, if needs be, we will provide the cream so that we finish with a very,
very good and attractive cup of coffee. [Applause.]

To my mind, this will be the first time in this country or elsewhere that
we will be engaging in proposition politics. So watch us with great
interest. We will be making waves. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is perhaps fitting to begin
by paying tribute to the black youth that went into the streets of our
country in order to transform our society. We will remember here that the
youth were raising important political questions, and that is whether the
youth of this country should continue to be taught in languages that they
did not speak in their own homes. I am proud to say that I am happy that my
organisation participated in this event of June 16.

But as I was sitting there listening to some of the speakers, I got worried
that we still have vestiges of the apartheid past. I stand here to invite
the youth to join hands with all of us who love the future in order to
eradicate the past so that we can move freely to the future. When I was
listening I said to myself: Those of you who are in the youth structures,
who still have parents that teach you about the past, I invite you to join
all other youth and patriots to move towards the future and disregard what
your parents are teaching you. [Applause.]

This struggle will continue to persist and we must all join hands in order
to eradicate that which kept all of us in bondage. It is therefore
necessary for us, collectively, to think and reflect on what our new
democracy offers to the youth. As we do so, we should also be aware that
most of the youth are very clear and committed and they are patriots to the
new dispensation. Our society should therefore get rid of all the old
vestiges and also be prepared to encapsulate what our youth is here to do.

Addressing youth unemployment, youth access to education, and improving
youth education should be the cornerstone of our society. I therefore urge
all the youth to participate in all formations that have been created so
that their future can be improved.

I was also reminded of the saying: "You can lead a horse to water but you
cannot make him drink." Indeed, Comrade Montsitsi, it appears that black
will remain black, and white will remain white. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: Madam Deputy Speaker, I prepared my speech to greet the hon
Minister Pahad because this portfolio of youth matters is part of his
responsibility but he hasn't even honoured us with his presence. That's how
seriously he takes this matter.

When we commemorate the events of 16 June 1976, we remind ourselves and the
generations who were not there to bear witness to the atrocities of that
day, that any single party who attempts to dominate another would create
and precipitate conflict. In 1976 it was the minority led-government that
sought to dominate the majority of South Africans who were not taken
seriously enough by those that were in power then.

Similarly throughout the world, even here, in the almost 10-year-old new
South Africa, and especially on our doorstep in Zimbabwe, we find that the
majority of youth who is excluded by the elite feel that they are not
playing a meaningful role in decision-making and are therefore feeling
disillusioned, disaffected and marginalised by government and politicians
in general. That answers the question why so many youth have not registered
and it explains the concern of the ANC and their encouraging the youth to
vote now. The youth will vote if they have a reason to vote. The elitism of
the ANC-led Government is the reason why the youth is not registering.

The youth is increasingly cynical and disengaging. We have not made them
that way. The disillusionment comes from the promises that you have not
fulfilled. Because of the lack of delivery on the election promises that
the ANC has made since 1994, South Africa's youth is generally withdrawing
from formal party political activity. They look at many leaders within the
ANC-led Government, the National Youth Commission and the ANC Youth League,
and they see the same people very similar to Tony Yengeni and Winnie
Mandela. [Interjections.]

They see fallen heroes who fought a good fight as soldiers in the struggle
against apartheid, but who have now deserted the youth in the remaining
battle to achieve economic freedom. All they see is an elite who is
increasingly becoming enriched at the expense of the blood of the youth who
lost their lives in 1976, and those that are still losing their lives now
because of the lack of delivery on treatment for HIV/Aids, jobs and
poverty.

They see the cronies of the ANC Youth League dominate the structures of
government such as the National Youth Commission and the Umsobomvu Fund,
and they see that the few projects that have managed to roll out now ahead
of the elections would not benefit anyone except the closest brothers and
sisters of the ANC. The youth out there is vigilant enough to see that the
ANC Youth League Secretary-General, Fikile Mbalula, has a brother, Jabu
Mbalula, who was appointed by the President as the Chairman of the National
Youth Commission. They are not stupid, they see that. They see the
nepotism. [Interjections.]

You see, Madam Deputy Speaker, Government's numerous izimbizos and
lekgotlas to reach out to youth in communities have become perceived as
nothing more than Government-sponsored ANC road shows ahead of next year's
elections. They see that.

A recent example of this is the road show last month which the National
Youth Commission, the Umsobomvu Fund and the ANC Youth League jointly
undertook through the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and elsewhere to
dangle the pre-election carrot of funding for young entrepreneurs. This is
necessary, but don't abuse the powers of state to do so.

It cannot be established if any votes have been bought in this manner but
only time will tell whether the Umsobomvu Fund's R850 million will be
sufficient to buy enough votes for the youth constituency. Why does the
National Youth Commission not consult the legitimate youth organisations of
this country?

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: Is it possible for
someone to help this speaker to talk sense? [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr C M MORKEL: That's why the DA won in your constituency, because you
don't talk sense.

We are consistently told that the National Youth Commission consults the
South African Youth Council. Does the South African Youth Council have the
participation and representivity of youth out there? The answer is
unfortunately ``no''. The youth has disengaged.

This must be the priority of Government - to find a way of building the
capacity of structures such as the South African Youth Commission, because
we are not against a mechanism to facilitate youth development but the
bloatedness of the present National Youth Commission structure. We say the
type of streamlined structure that we, as the DA, have put in place in the
Western Cape government is the type of structure that we need elsewhere in
the country. We don't need a youth commission that does not have contact
with the youth.

The majority of the youth who are unemployed and cannot study any further
are left with little or nothing to live for. If they don't vote for us,
they won't vote for the ANC. The DA would prefer that Government implement
a basic income grant and opportunity voucher to utilise funds from, for
example, the National Skills Fund. Thank you. [Interjections.] [Time
expired.]

Mr E N MTHETHWA: Deputy Chair, some of the things which are said by the DA
really do not deserve any response. They are just jokes, seriously. The DA
can never say anything about the youth because they know nothing.

We who have trodden the path of youth activism know exactly that the only
thing that the DA knows, through their leader, is to be propagandists of
the killing machine, the SADF of the past. That's all they know. They are
really a disgrace to the nation. Their reactionary mindset and their
thoughts remind us of Jurassic Park. They belong in the past.

I want to start my contribution here by paying tribute to all the
generations of youth who fought apartheid. I want to pay particular tribute
to the current generation of the youth who are faced with the challenge of
fighting poverty created by centuries of colonialism and apartheid. We call
on the youth to acquire identity documents, even if you come across long
queues and frustrations, you have to acquire them. It's about your future.

Sihlalo, esontweni langomhla ka-26 kuya kumhla ka-30 kuMeyi siye
savakashela egatsheni engilisebenzelayo endaweni yakwaMthethwa.
Besinemihlangano nentsha ezikoleni zamazinga aphakeme. Ziningi izinto
ebesixoxa ngazo, kusukela ezindabeni zezifundo ezibalulekile i-ANC elokhu
izisho njalo zeSayensi nezoBuchwepheshe nezinye, ukwakhiwa kwama-SGB
nezinye izinto ezifuze lezo.

Siye sakhuluma kakhulu ngamalungelo abantwana kanye nokuvikeleka kwawo.
Kodwa enye into esike sayibalula kakhulu indaba yokuvuselelwa kwezwekazi
lase-Afrika. Sigxile kakhulu siqinisa ezinselelweni ukuvuselelwa kwe-Afrika
okubhekene nazo. Enye yazo ukulwisana nesihlava sokubandlululana
nokucwasana phakathi kwabantu abamnyama bebodwa okwande kakhulu
ikakhulukazi esifundeni engiphuma kuso KwaZulu-Natali.

Ngenxa yokuthi sasikhuluma nabaThethwa, sabakhumbuza ngeqhaza elabanjwa
ukhokho wabo ekulweni lesi sihlava sokubandlululana ngobuzwe, uPixley ka-
Isaka Seme mayethi ukucwasana lokhu lidimoni okumele liqedwe nezimpande
zalo. Sabanxusa abafundi nothisha ukuthi balandele ezinyathelweni zakhe
uSeme, uNyambose inkonyane yenkosi. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs
follows.)

[Chairperson, during the week of 26 to 30 May we visited the branch I work
for in the Mthethwa area. We had meetings with the youth at high schools.
We talked about many issues of importance that the ANC is always
emphasising, namely science and technology, as well as the implementation
of SGBs and other things related to this.

We talked a lot about children's rights and their protection. However,
another thing that we pointed out, in particular, was the issue of the
African Renaissance. We focused on challenges that the African Renaissance
is faced with. One of them is the fight against discrimination among black
people, which is prevalent in the KwaZulu-Natal province in particular,
where I come from.

When we were talking with the Mthethwa clan, we reminded them about the
role their forefathers played in fighting against tribal discrimination.
Pixley ka-Isaka Seme said discrimination is a demon which needs to be
uprooted. We appealed to learners and teachers to follow in the footsteps
of Seme, Nyambose, the prince.]

The first major opportunity for the youth is the platform created by the
democratic Government. The very fact that we and the dinosaurs of the past
discussed, today, matters of youth is a step forward. Flowing from this,
the National Youth Commission is in The Presidency - the highest office in
the land. We need to emphasise to cynics such as the DA that the National
Youth Commission's mandate is to ensure that Government takes youth matters
seriously. This therefore means that it has to be judged against this
backdrop.

We know, as we have participated in the struggle for freedom, that the
price young people paid for their freedom is incalculable. The National
Youth Service has received a positive response from Government, and this is
visible progress. The National Youth Service will help our country create a
general young community worker. We call on the Gauteng and Western Cape
provincial legislatures to form youth commissions, thus following the
example of other provinces. [Applause.]

Since the appointment of the fund CEO, Mr M Kekana, in 2001 the roll-out
programmes are beginning to make a difference throughout the country. By
way of example, the youth of Mohlaletsi village in Limpopo have recently
completed the Department of Public Works programme in which they have also
been accredited with certificates in this field. Out of 60 of them, 57
passed; two went to school and one got a job. This is a success story of
internship learning from among the many stories we have.

In Ermelo in Mpumalanga province 20 youth are being trained as red meat
producers. When they finish this course, they will be in a position to
start their own businesses. In KwaZulu-Natal, Umsobomvu visited the
constituency I serve in March this year. Subsequent to that, the youth of
Mabhuyeni grouped themselves and formed a development youth committee, and
they were trained as HIV/Aids counsellors and accredited to provide home-
based care.

These programmes are run in partnership with almost all government
departments. We call on the youth to seize these opportunities and locate
offices of the Umsobomvu Fund in their areas. We thank Government for these
opportunities and proudly inform Government that there is overwhelming
approval of the fund, but also a need to support and increase the Umsobomvu
Fund's coffers to face the challenge of youth development. We say this
because we know that our Government is serious about youth development.

We also call on business, organised labour and all progress-loving South
Africans to invest in the youth for they would be investing in the future.
The area of state machinery has to be entered as well. We commend those
youths who are police reservists. We further call on the youth to join the
army, the navy and the SA Air Force and help us to transform this important
arm of state. To the unemployed youth, we say that we are aware of your
situation which reflects the legacy of apartheid. However, immense
opportunities have been created for you to take advantage of.

We need to change our mindset from waiting for someone to employ us and
rather organise ourselves, approach our leaders with ideas and seize
opportunities for self-employment in the true spirit of vukuzenzele. To the
youth who are still studying, we say that the Freedom Charter proclaimed
that the doors of learning and culture shall be opened to all. Take
advantage of this reality today! Change Verwoerd's vision for blacks and
Africans particularly! Learn to lead, to manage, to employ our people and
not to be hewers of wood and drawers of water, as Verwoerd proclaimed.

To the youth in the minorities, we say that you need to join hands with the
progressive youth alliance of the country and together engage yourselves in
building bridges. Defy those who preach racism for it has no place in the
country, now and in the future. We commend all youth in the national
minorities, particularly white youth, for their participation at the
funeral of Tata Sisulu and their attendance of the Africa Month celebration
addressed by President Mbeki. This is what true patriotism means. Continue
in that way because this is your country. Keep in contact with your
compatriots.

To the working youth we say that the ANC Government is the only one
championing your interests. There can never be any other. Take advantage of
legislative and institutional frameworks created for democracy and engage
your Government constructively.

To the youth with disabilities, your movement, the ANC, and Government are
humbled by your immense support and positive contributions that you
continue to make in the construction and development of our country.
Government will continue, for its part, to pay special attention to your
needs.

To young women, the Government's policy is biased towards women
particularly from the disadvantaged communities. This is because of our
commitment to gender equality projects in society. Seize this opportunity
to further engage Government and society in your situation.

To the youth in sport we say that you need to continue sport to foster
patriotism and nation-building, raising a healthy youth and fostering
academic success and excellence. It is time that sport's transformation
code is adapted to enforce transformation and deracialisation. Investment
in sport development has to be fast-tracked. We must also invest in young
women's sport and encourage them to engage in all sports codes.

In the spirit of vukuzenzele we say that all youth must seize the
opportunity of democracy. Clearly at the Government level, we have more
effectively used people's power to create the resources, both financial and
human, to fight poverty, expand spending, social and economic investment
and human development, thus responding positively to the challenges of
reconstruction and development of our country.

To all young people, we say that seizing the opportunities of democracy is
about taking responsibility to move our struggle to a new level. It is
about the vitally important spirit and practice of vukuzenzele. In the
words of wisdom expressed by Moses Kotane, I quote:


  At this hour of destiny, your country and your people need you. The
  future is in your hands and it will be what you make of it.

We want to emphasise to those prophets of doom who come to sit here and
shout slogans that there is only one thing we can assure them of: They will
continue whining and we will continue to democratically rule this country.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson and hon
members, meeting at the Congress of the People in June 1955, our country's
freedom fighters promulgated the vision of a South Africa in which the
people shall govern. United in a common sense of mission, they undertook to
reconstruct the socioeconomic foundations of South African society, to make
South Africa a place the wealth of which is shared amongst those who work
it.

The vision we speak of became the legacy that tempered the steel. It
inspired the youth of the 1970s. These were the young lions who took to the
streets in June 1976. As they took to the streets, their roaring voice
haunted the apartheid regime with a spectre of its own negation. Some of
them have since passed on, leaving us with the obligation and the honour to
build the South Africa of the 21st century into a monument that celebrates
their dream.

Seated in the public gallery, this afternoon, are some of the pathfinders
of our democratic system of government. They include members of the
provincial executive councils, mayors and councillors, municipal managers
and other practitioners. Sitting alongside them are the traditional leaders
of our people, led by Inkosi Mpiyezintombi Mzimela. Also present in the
gallery are members of the task team which is facilitating the consultative
process towards the White Paper on the Role of Traditional Leaders in our
system of government.

These esteemed representatives of our people are guided in their work by
the slew of legislation which was passed by this House. These laws we
passed in this House sought to define the meaning of national development,
as well as the mechanisms and strategies by which development is to be
achieved. Those who are at the coalface of the effort to make our
democratic system of government functional are familiar with the syndrome
of issues which constitute the formidable challenge we face.

They know what it takes to deal with the enduring legacy left by those who
pursued exclusionary policies and strategies. Some of them are saddled with
local areas that are without any productive economic activity to speak of,
and therefore local jurisdictions without a revenue base that can be used
as a platform from which to make welfare-enhancing interventions.

Previously, state structures were mechanisms of domination that discounted
participation by the masses of the people. The toy telephones that were
established in the townships, and in the so-called homelands, were meant to
draw those who were willing to auction their souls into networks of
patronage. Similar distortions could be observed in the composition and
operation of the parastatals. These were part of a public system that
sought to produce a racially skewed pattern of resource allocation. They
were complicit in the act of spawning indigence in a country that is not
only endowed with an abundance of natural and mineral resources, but also
has a relatively developed industrial base.

The totality of the apartheid state machinery consisted of a central
government, four administrations, ten bantustan administrations and over 1
200 racially segregated local government administrations. Within the
relatively short period of nine years, we have been able to bring down that
apartheid ediface, and to construct a new state machinery with an
inclusive, democratic and egalitarian orientation.

When they wrote the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, our
lawmakers were driven by the desire to create a structure of government
which would be suited to the task of overcoming conditions of
underdevelopment, conditions which, to this day, continue to beset our
country. In the first five years of democratic governance, building
governmental structures at the level of national and provincial spheres was
an area of priority focus.

Under the rubric of the RDP, Government was able to define key sectors and
areas for immediate intervention. What began with the four priority areas
of the RDP, namely, meeting basic needs, developing our human resources,
building the economy and democratising the state and society resulted in a
fundamental reconstruction of the South African polity.

National Government's achievement in extricating the economy from the
doldrums of negative growth is a matter of record. Following growth of 3%
in 2002, the economy is set to expand by 3,3% this year, rising to 3,7% in
2004 and 4% in 2005. Whilst these projections are encouraging, it is
important for us to realise that the achievement of dynamic growth cannot
be assured unless we have functional, efficient and developmentally
oriented structures across our three spheres of government. It goes without
saying that had such structures been in place from the onset of our
democratic transition, we would by now have realised more robust rates of
economic growth.

This year's division of revenue provides for a strong real growth in
national transfers to provinces and local government of 6,1% and 12,2%
respectively over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period. These
increases speak to our commitment to accelerate the delivery of free basic
services and to extend the provision of these services to those who cannot
afford them. The increases also signal our intention to direct resources
towards the goal of creating employment opportunities through the expansion
of labour-intensive infrastructure development programmes.

Provinces are increasingly proving that their place in the developmental
division of labour entails more than serving as a locus of social spending.
They need to be oriented more and more towards making a more intimate and
substantial contribution to the national effort of growing the economy. The
growing ability of provinces to make effective use of increased funding
from the national fiscus is a matter that is deserving of commendation.

In this regard we are particularly heartened by the outstanding achievement
of the Limpopo province. Between 1995 and the year 2000, the province
experienced an average growth rate of 5,5% in real terms.  This is way
above the national average. Although this growth is of a low base, the fact
that it is happening at all means that our confidence in the provincial
government sphere is not misplaced. It is even more gratifying to see this
happening in what is predominantly a rural province. It says to all of us
that depending on what we do, the rural areas of our country can also
emerge from the trap of negative economic growth and even from the doldrums
of low surplus equilibrium.

Mindful of the need to reinforce these positive trends which are emerging
within the provincial sphere, the Ministry of Provincial and Local
Government has been systematically working at helping to improve provincial
governments' capacity for developing growth and development strategies and
to ensure that there are synergistic links between those strategies and the
Integrated Development Plans of the municipalities.

Experience has shown that the impact of the progress we make, thanks to the
efforts of national and provincial government, has tended to be minimised
by the absence of support from local jurisdictions. The growing maturity of
local government increases the possibility for our overall system of
government to pay consistent and co-ordinated attention to the problems
which beset our local economies.

With this in mind, we are paying attention to the task of increasing the
capacity of municipalities to make informed interventions; interventions
which seek to stimulate economic growth and put us in a position to meet
the basic needs of our people on a sustainable basis. Through the
Integrated Development Plans, municipalities are developing local
socioeconomic profiles which should help the public sector and the private
sector to take decisions that are mutually beneficial.

In particular, we are encouraging municipalities that are home to
designated rural development and urban renewal nodes to make use of these
mechanisms in order to influence investment within the small-scale segment
of the economy. The stimulation of economic activity in these areas,
however small, will touch in very positive ways the lives of our people who
are confined to positions that are marginal to the economy.

In the 2003 budget, we make substantial resources available to the local
government sphere. This is meant to provide for poverty relief, to extend
infrastructure delivery and to further strengthen the local government
system. National transfers to local government increase at an annual growth
rate of 18,4% from R8,8 billion in 2003 to R14,6 billion in the 2005-06
financial year.

The bulk of the additional resources will be directed towards the provision
of free basic services and the extension of services to areas which are not
presently serviced. Part of that resource will also be directed towards
infrastructure development. In total, R4,1 billion over the MTEF period
will be made available for water, electricity, refuse removal and
sanitation. This will be done as part of Government's commitment to
providing free basic services to households who cannot afford them.

So immense are the responsibilities we are progressively devolving to local
government that all of us will have to pay unflagging attention to the task
of building local government capacity. Although uneven, the progress made
by our municipalities so far is indeed significant. Key areas of progress
include the fact that all municipalities have now adopted Integrated
Development Plans. The overall quality of the IDPs is now steadily
improving.

Further improvements are expected in the light of increased funding for
various municipal, capital, operating and capacity-building grants from
national Government. Municipal, capital and operating budgets are estimate
to total R74,5 billion in the financial year 2002-03 compared to R64,5
billion in 2001-02. The spatial distortions which are a function of the
differential impact of the apartheid legacy are manifested in part by the
fact that our municipalities are variable in their capacity to discharge
their constitutional mandate.

The district municipalities in particular are in the lower spectrum of
capability. So far we have succeeded in augmenting the institutional
capacity of district municipalities by establishing planning,
implementation and support centres in 39 district municipalities. It is our
intention to make sure that in the not-so-distant future, these Pim centres
shall have been established in all 47 district municipalities.

An additional R300 million over this MTEF period has been set aside for
capacity-building. An interim framework has also been adopted for aligning
the capacity-building grants into a single grant by 2005-06.

As we all know, our local government legislation provides for a system of
local government which attaches significant importance to societal
participation in matters of governance. Indeed, communities in our country
cannot make the transition from poverty to prosperity without governmental
structures that approximate the ideal type model visualised in our local
government legislation. The absence of such structures constrains our
ability to achieve development.

There is a continuing need for us to ensure that we have structures of
government with the necessary capacity to mobilise and arouse the masses of
our people into co-ordinated action for sustainable development. On 24 and
25 June, the Ministry and Department of Provincial and Local Government are
convening a national conference to look at the functional status of ward
committees. Ward committees already exist in many of our municipalities. We
want to learn from the invaluable diversity of experience gained by ward
committee members in the crucible of practice.

The importance of ward committees cannot be overemphasised. If a ward
committee does not yet exist in your local area, it means that you have not
yet taken the opportunity to bring democracy to the place where you live.
The quality of service you receive is only as good as the quality of
democracy that you have in your local area. I therefore urge our people to
take their destiny into their own hands by participating in the activities
of ward committees. With each passing day, we see the tide of
democratisation continually and irreversibly turning towards the pinnacle
of human achievement.

Our conviction in the inevitability of that for which many in our country
sacrificed their lives is enhanced by the actions of many South Africans of
goodwill. We have noted with appreciation the recent study visit undertaken
by the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local
Government. Members of the portfolio committee visited 63 municipalities in
various parts of the country in order to put their collective finger on the
heartbeat of the system. They came to a conclusion with which we agree,
namely that the system is alive. Our collective responsibility is to pay
continuing attention to the health of the system.

The progress made thus far to the extent that our Ministry and Department
are associated with it could not have been possible without the peer
counsel of my Cabinet colleagues. In addition, the Deputy Minister, the
Director-General Lindiwe Msengana-Ndlela, as well as the rest of the
Ministry and departmental staff have always done what they had to do in
order to render tolerable the weight of the load we carry. The premiers,
MECs, traditional leaders, mayors and councillors are among the partners
whose continuing co-operation is a sine qua non of our success.

Our overall capacity to serve the country of our birth has improved thanks
to the contribution of our many partners, some of whom are in the gallery
this afternoon. With partners such as we have, whose commitment to our
country and our people is so unconditional, the prospects for the future
could not be brighter. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Chairperson, comrades and friends - and lest he gets upset,
my good friend and Comrade MEC Mohamed Bhabha who is here and who, as you
know, was until not so long ago, the NCOP chairperson for the committee.
May I also, on behalf of the portfolio committee, welcome our many friends
in the gallery.

In shaping our state, we have, we pride ourselves, broken out of the mould
of unitary versus federal and forged our own unique, innovative system of
co-operative governance. In the last two years and more, we have taken this
further.

We increasingly speak of integrated governance, not just co-operative
governance. And the imperative is simple: The need for accelerated delivery
and development. We must push back the frontiers of poverty, said the
President, and indeed we must. To do this effectively, we have to have more
integrated governance. This is perhaps one of the most salient messages to
emerge from our recent study tour of municipalities. For all the
weaknesses, municipalities have made strides towards linking governance and
planning through Independent Development Plans. In time, they will improve
the links between IDPs and budgets, as suggested by the Minister a moment
ago.

But provincial and national departments, say municipalities, ignore the
IDPs in their plans, programmes and budgets. [Interjections.] Of course,
IDPs may lack quality. If so, provincial and national departments have to
assist municipalities to improve them.

Provinces, moreover, should develop provincial growth and development plans
which should be shaped by and in turn shape municipal IDPs. The portfolio
committee believes that legislation should be considered to ensure greater
co-operation from national and provincial departments on implementing IDPs.
The pending Intergovernmental Relations Bill should seek to address this
among other issues of integrated governance and planning.

It is in terms of the need for more integrated governance towards
accelerating delivery and development that the portfolio committee
approached the Ministry's and the department's budget. Our report appeared
in the ATCs of 10 June. We feel the department is more directed and focused
these days. And it spent a remarkable 99,6% of its budget over the past
financial year. In fact, of the R22,8 million unspent, R8,9 million
constituted the allocation to the cultural rights commission, which is only
to be established this financial year.

Co-ordination and coherence were the key themes of the department's budget
presentation to us. The committee certainly welcomes, as the Minister
confirmed a moment ago, the rationalisation of the different grants offered
to local government. The Local Economic Development Plan and Social Plan
Grant are to be incorporated into the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure
Programme next year. The municipal infrastructure grant will be a new grant
from this year. The local government transitional fund will be incorporated
into the local government equitable share. Local government capacity-
building is to be incorporated into the municipal systems improvement
programme in 2005-06.

The committee welcomes the 60% increase in equitable share allocated to
local government, from R3,9 billion to R6,3 billion this year. There is
also a 33% increase in the CMIP grant. These increases will enhance the
capacity of municipalities to deliver services, including free basic water
and electricity.

The more effectively and productively municipalities use this money, the
stronger becomes their case for increases in the equitable share and other
transfers from national Government. And it is clear that municipalities
will not be able to fulfil their constitutional mandate without significant
increases in funds from the national fiscus.

More money alone is not the answer. The capacity of municipalities has to
be significantly developed. This means greater co-ordination of all
capacity-building role-players within a commonly accepted framework that
the department is urged to finalise as soon as possible. The department
also has to contribute to rescuing the local government Seta, which has
been a persistent failure.

Crucial to effective service delivery and development is the proper
implementation of the new division of powers and functions between district
and local municipalities, which to come into effect on 1 July. Both our
study tour and budget reports draw attention to the considerable challenges
in this regard and we urge the department to attend to them.

The committee welcomes the more recent progress in the Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development and Urban Renewal Programmes. We are to visit
the nodes next year. While recognising the difficulties, we feel these
programmes have to be more effectively implemented. For the programmes to
be successful, integrated governance has to work, and the more integrated
governance works, the more the programmes will be successful.

These programmes reinforce the need for a single Public Service for the
country as a whole, instead of the present system in which municipal
officials and staff are not included. A single service of course will allow
the movement of officials from one sphere to another. We welcome the
progress towards realising this.

The committee also welcomes the department's commitment to focusing more on
provincial government. To ensure more effective integrated governance, it
will also be important to provide greater clarity and certainty on what
precisely the powers and functions of each sphere are and in what sense
they are distinct from and overlap each other. We need to ensure that the
distribution of powers and functions serve to advance delivery and
development. The committee feels that the department-led review of powers
and functions of each sphere should be speeded up.

Of course, integrated governance is not advanced just through the
department's intergovernmental relations subprogramme, but the committee
notes with concern that the allocation to this subprogramme has been
decreased by 13%. Partnerships, of course, are key to integrated governance
- not just among the spheres of government, but also between the state and
key actors in society. This is what underpinned last week's Growth and
Development Summit. Integrated governance is also crucial to advancing
economic growth and job creation. The department's Local Economic
Development, SMMEs and other related programmes and projects need to be
emphasised more.

The LED fund has R120 million to disburse. An amount of R26,7 million will
be allocated to rural nodes to promote agriculture and tourism. Three
thousand temporary jobs will be created in this financial year. The
department needs to assist municipalities more to implement LED and locate
this in the context of the decisions taken at the Growth and Development
Summmit.

The majority in the committee feels that the department is coping
increasingly well with its responsibilities, even if many challenges
persist. As MPs, however, we realise that it is not our responsibility
purely to fold our arms and criticise the department's budget each year and
offer all sorts of wise words. It is also our responsibility as MPs through
our constituency work and a variety of other means to actually assist in
the implementation of the programmes and projects that the Ministry,
department and ourselves share collectively.

We thank the Ministry and the department for their co-operation. In
particular, we congratulate the new Director-General, Ms Lindiwe Msengana-
Ndlela, on her appointment and note the effective manner in which she has
assumed leadership of the department. We thank all the officials of the
department and the parliamentary liaision officers, the Minister and Deputy
Minister and, also on behalf of the committee, I express our sincerest
thanks to our secretaries Mr Llewellyn Brown - and I hope he has found it
possible to tear himself away from his work to be here this afternoon - and
Ms Bulelwa Madikane and our part-time research assistant, Mr Chris
Sibanyoni. To all of them, our sincere thanks. [Applause.]

Mr G A J GROBLER: Minister, welcome back in South Africa and thank you for
arranging such a big audience for us today.

The DA puts a high premium on the performances of municipalities. The DA
acknowledges the right of municipalities to govern themselves. We agree
with the increases in the allocations of the Consolidated Municipal
Infrastructure Programme. We support the Local Economic Development
Programme, the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Strategy and the
Urban Renewal Strategy, which are key elements in poverty alleviation. And
therefore money must be channelled to municipalities through the above
grants to allow them to play a meaningful developmental role.

The DA, however, is concerned about the following. With regard to municipal
budgets, the operating and capital budgets of municipalities show an
increase of 15,7% in comparison with the previous financial year. Capital
budgets show an increase of 12% and operating income budgets an increase of
16,5%. But, one must ask oneself, when one looks at these percentage
increases recently and over the last couple of months: Was this done on a
scientific basis by municipalities? What guidelines were followed? Was the
inflation rate taken into consideration, the one that one can believe, or
maybe not?

Again we see budget increases this year well above the inflation rate. The
concern is whether it can be expected from the already overburdened
ratepayers to carry these higher-than-inflation hikes on an ongoing basis?

Regarding the categories of municipalities, the six metropolitan
municipalities constitute 62,7% of local government budgets for 2002-3;
category B municipalities constitute 30% and district municipalities only
4%. This brings me to district municipalities or category C municipalities.

This low share of category C municipalities shows clearly that through the
RSC levies, district municipalities currently make a relatively low
contribution to services in this sphere of government. We welcome the
relook at the RSC levies and request that it should be reviewed in the
light of the expansion of property rates on agricultural and communal land.
Without this source of income, the necessity of district municipalities
also comes into question, and the viability of these institutions should be
seriously looked at.

Of the amount of R24,3 billion owed to municipalities - listen carefully -
8% or R1,9 billion is owed by central and provincial government to
municipalities. This is totally unacceptable. It is R500 million more than
the total revenue from RSC levies of district municipalities in all nine
provinces. Minister, what steps are you going to take to alleviate the
situation?

Another issue is audits and annual reports. The DA's question here is: Is
the money that is budgeted for spent to the benefit of the people, or is it
wasted on incompetent administrators? Many municipalities are still not
able to submit their financial statements on time, and some not at all.
Information supplied by the Auditor-General on municipal financial
statements as at 30 September 2002 showed that 77% of financial statements
for municipal financial years 2000-01 and 2001-02 were still outstanding.
Another alarming issue on these financial statements was that a very high
portion of these audits were qualified. What is the reason for this
unacceptable situation?

In many instances, we are now experiencing the results of municipalities
appointing unqualified and inexperienced personnel. It was a case of jobs
for pals. If pals are to be appointed, at least look at pals who can do the
job. Let me give you an example: Teachers without the necessary
qualifications were appointed as municipal managers. Lecturers in history
were appointed as financial managers - to mention only two examples.
[Interjections.]

It was great to hear from the Minister earlier on that a lot of money is
being given to capacity-building and to rectify the situation, because we
need to uplift these people who have not got the financial experience or
whatever experience they need to have to be good managers in different
positions.

Another concern is the salary structure of these officials, especially that
of municipal managers. Just ask Minister Manuel. Salaries take up the
largest share of municipal budgets, totalling 32% of operating income. If
the cost of electricity and municipal transfers are excluded, the share of
personnel costs may be as high as 45%. This aspect of municipal spending
needs scrutiny.

I want to read from the Auditor-General's report tabled at a district
council meeting at the end of May 2003. It is a typical auditor's report of
the vast majority of ANC/New NP-controlled municipalities across the
country. Let me read it:


  The balance per VAT control account had not been reconciled to the VAT
  return which resulted in the difference of R9 750 309 at year end. An
  asset count was not performed. An internal audit section and audit
  committee was not in place during the financial year as required by the
  Act.

When unqualified audit reports, as experienced in all of the DA-controlled
municipalities become the order of the day, the DA will support a
provincial and local government Vote.

At the end, I just want to say thank you to the staff and personnel of the
department. Under the circumstances, they do a wonderful job. [Applause.]

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, on 29
October 2001, the hon Deputy Minister for Provincial and Local Government,
the hon Botha, made a commendable speech during the launching of
performance indicators for municipalities in Pretoria when she said, and I
quote:


  The wheel of local government transformation continues to grind. At the
  centre of this transformation process is the imperative to build a
  developmental, democratic, accountable, people-centred and efficient
  system of local government that effectively responds to the needs of
  local communities, especially the poor.

The ANC salutes this and is on track in ensuring that there is effective
delivery on the ground. It has a record and historical background of our
painful past, and of course the spirit of reconciliation, reconstruction
and development.

Our new system of local government was inaugurated a little more than three
years ago. Our approach to the system takes into account the reality that
we come from a past which was characterised by inconsistent forms of
municipalities across the country, divided tax bases with systematic
underdevelopment of black residential areas and poor or nonexistent
municipal service delivery in those areas which lacked economic and service
delivery infrastructure.

It is also important to note that the roots of apartheid local government
lay in the pre-apartheid era when segregative legislation was passed and
set in motion a racially divided system. The governing ideal was that urban
areas were essentially white creations and dwelling places, and that blacks
were only there to provide labour and move back to their reserves. Thus the
Native Act of 1923 created separate urban areas for blacks known as
townships. These fell under the control of white urban authorities.

To compound the problem, we had a system of local government financing that
assumed each municipality's capacity to manage its own challenges. The
common practice that revenue should be self-generated suited white local
authorities with wealthy populations and large economic concentrations.

From the above, it is clear that the new municipalities are not and cannot
start from the same place. Some new local municipalities and metropolitan
municipalities were, by and large, financially viable, a position they
inherited from apartheid's skewed distribution of resources. Their
creditworthiness has never been in question and, therefore, they were even
able to leverage resources from the financial institutions for use in
discharging their obligations to municipal residents. The same cannot be
said especially of those municipalities in provinces which are
predominantly rural.

It may become necessary for Salga to assist municipalities in drafting
performance contracts of municipal managers to ensure that these respond to
their developmental needs. Furthermore, it may be necessary to appreciate
or review these contracts from time to time.

In November 2000, the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act of 2000 was
published to establish a framework for planning, a performance management
system, effective use of resources and organisational change in a business
context. The Act also established a system for local councils to report on
their performance and give an opportunity to residents to compare this
performance with others.

The Government's commitment to assisting municipalities with poverty relief
primarily through the provision of free basic services to poor households
is made clear by substantial increases in the equitable share grant from
R2,6 billion in 2001-02 to R3,9 billion in 2002 with a further increase of
R5 billion in 2003 and R5,5 billion in 2004-05.

Before the introduction of the new system of local government, Cabinet and
the President's Co-ordinating Council adopted a trajectory of local
government transformation with the following timeframes. The first was the
establishment phase from 2000 to 2002 which is completed; the consolidation
phase from 2002 to 2005 which is underway; and the sustainability phase
from 2005 to 2010.

It cannot be denied that huge advances have been made with regard to the
transformation of local government towards its being a delivery sphere of
government. The municipal demarcation process has successfully been
completed by reducing the number of municipalities from 843 to 284. The
Municipal Demarcation Board determined that Johannesburg, Durban, Cape
Town, Pretoria, East Rand and Port Elizabeth be declared as metropolitan
areas.
Key pieces of legislation such as the Local Government: Municipal
Structures Act have been enacted. Major policy issues have been addressed
such as integrated development planning, municipal performance management,
local economic development and municipal services partnerships. Local
government financing issues are being addressed through pieces of
legislation such as the property rating Bills and the Public Finance
Management Act. Local government has been refocused towards development,
and poor municipalities in rural and urban areas have been targeted through
the Integrated Rural Development Programme and Urban Renewal Programme.

[Allow me to quickly give attention to my home province, the North West,
and say a few words about the good job being done by our municipalities. In
the North West we have just thrown a big celebration at the Moses Kotane
Municipality, which falls under the regional Bojanala Municipality.

Our people have waited for so long, from the time of the apartheid
government to that of the then government of Bophuthatswana, when they had
one tap of salty water and lived in the dust. I want to say that those
people were at the celebration, receiving their land back. They received
their land back and they are delighted about the enthusiasm brought about
by the municipalities. [Applause.]

I also want to say that we have provided a lot of water, which is a
provincial project, at a cost of R80 million. The people have constructed
their own tarred road of 47 kilometres, starting in the adjacent area. They
composed a song during lunch which says that apartheid is sad, and it is
satan because it dispossessed them of their land. [Laughter.] In the
background grandfathers and headmen were also singing in baritone ... [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]

Mrs S A SEATON: Deputy Chairperson, as is by now customary at this time of
the year, the IFP wishes to take issue with the Government in respect of
its dealings with traditional leaders, and in particular in respect of the
relationship between traditional authorities and the newly established
system of local government.

The core issue I wish to address today is Government's inordinate delays in
officially finalising its policy in respect of this matter. I say
officially finalising policy because it clearly finalised this matter years
ago and is merely going through the motions of currently finalising policy,
and is going through the motions of consulting in order to delay as long as
possible the eventual public release of this predetermined position.

Government published a discussion document in April 2000, entitled Towards
a White Paper on Traditional Leadership and Institutions. Over three years
have passed since that date, and at the rate we are going, it is feasible
that Government may end up delaying the release of its position until after
the elections. According to a recent comment by the department, the White
Paper is due this month, but in giving us this date, there were the by now
standard accompanying ifs and buts, suggesting we may have to wait a little
longer. Certainly if one takes heed of previous pronouncements on this
matter, the precedent is clear. Allow me to trace a little history on this
matter.

On 9 February 2001, the President indicated that the proper definition of
the role of traditional authorities was ``receiving urgent attention''.
Thus on 21 March 2001, the Cabinet appointed a Ministerial Committee to
consult all stakeholders on a Bill ``aimed at addressing, on an interim
basis, the issues of the roles and functions of traditional leaders'', the
outcome of which, according to the Minister on 1 June of that year, would
result in a draft Bill to be submitted to Cabinet.

The executive was clearly in top gear, with the Minister stating on 31 May
that he was ready to present this Bill to Cabinet while consultation
continued on the White Paper and its permanent solution. He said: ``The
White Paper will then provide us with the policy framework for permanent
legislation. All this must and can be achieved in the course of this
year.'' The President noted on 3 August 2001 that Government was ``seeking
to take this matter forward expeditiously''.

Despite the urgency and promised timing, towards year-end, it was clear
that the first deadline was just not going to be met. Thus on 4 December
2001, the Minister told traditional leaders that legislation would be
``introduced into the parliamentary process, both nationally and
provincially, in the first half of the year 2002''.

The President was also confident about 2002. On 8 February he stated that
``among the matters that we will bring to successful conclusion this year
is the definition of the role of traditional leaders in our system of
government''. He noted that there had been sufficient consultation to lay
the basis for the framework legislation. On 14 February he confirmed that
``a White Paper on the traditional system of government will be published
this year''.

By 13 June it was clear that the Minister had lost confidence in his
earlier deadline. He now claimed that "we are determined to ensure that
both the required national and provincial legislation is passed by November
this year".

Clearly this goal was proving unrealistic as well. On 29 October 2002 a
draft White Paper was published. In November, the date by which the
Minister had indicated earlier the legislation would have been passed by
Parliament, he then appointed a task team to advise on the finalisation of
the draft White Paper. Around the same time, the President too noted that
parties were ``still seized of the matter''.

So by year-end, there was still no White Paper and still no legislation. We
have now reached the mid-point of 2003 and are still waiting. By April the
President was still speaking of resolving matters ``as quickly as
possible'', which is similar to what he had been saying for several years.
Most important though, and hinting at finality, he stated:


  Obviously, we cannot celebrate our tenth anniversary of liberation in a
  situation in which we have not met our constitutional obligation to
  resolve all matters that attach to the issue of the institution of the
  traditional system of government.

The IFP concurs with the President on this. The issue has been on our
collective agenda from the time of Codesa, and it would be unthinkable to
go into elections next year with the matter still not put to bed. Still,
this gives us until April next year, another possible 10 months of no
progress.

Which brings us to the matter of why we are where we are today. Certainly,
one would be hard-pressed to object to the delays if the end result were
acceptable all round, and if the processes were really geared towards
negotiating a genuine solution. However, the IFP seriously doubts if this
is the case. One only has to remember the pathetic legislation half
introduced to Parliament and then withdrawn, purporting to grant
traditional leaders powers and functions in respect of issues such as wood
collection and rain-making, to realise that the issue was not being taken
seriously.

The Committee of Ministers appointed in March 2001 barely met. The
consultation process resulted in a draft White Paper, ignoring the inputs
of traditional leaders. On the task team appointed to advise the Minister
were two traditional leaders, strangely, both from the same province, but
notably not persons nominated by or carrying a mandate from the Coalition
of Traditional Leaders. Indeed, it was the understanding of the Coalition
of Traditional Leaders that the Minister would consult them before
appointing Coalition-nominated representatives, but this never occurred,
and the Minister appointed them unilaterally.

As a consequence the process remains a mess. When the task team sought to
consult with the Coalition, the Coalition indicated its unhappiness with
the process and refused to recognise the task team. A political wing of six
persons was then established comprising three representatives nominated by
the Minister and three by the Coalition, but in its six months of
existence, this body has never met.

The Coalition, having studied the draft terms of reference, made
recommendations to the Minister on expanding the terms of reference, and
has twice written to the Minister requesting that a meeting between its
leadership and the Minister take place, but to no avail. Indeed the
Minister has apparently not even acknowledged receipt of this
correspondence.

This is problematic to say the least, because it had also been understood
that the leadership of the Coalition would, having discussed the terms of
reference with the Minister, refer back to the Coalition with the Minister
in the form of a joint meeting. Needless to remark, this has not occurred
either. So the smoke and mirrors process continues, and there is nothing to
indicate that this Government has any serious intention of negotiating
anything.

The crux of the issue at stake is this: Government seeks to define a role
for traditional leaders and institutions of traditional leadership, which
totally exclude powers of local government - powers, which both sides
agreed, traditional authorities previously enjoyed - while traditional
leaders and their supporters seek to define a role premised on the return
of their previous powers of local governance.

The significance of these processes, delays and difficulties lies in their
constituting part of a broader backdrop in which Government has
unilaterally reneged on an agreement reached with traditional leaders
before the 2000 local government elections, and has generated a process to
either justify its behaviour or to place such a distance between the date
of the agreement and the formal conclusion of the policy process that the
starting point is rendered immaterial.

It is one thing for there to be a disagreement. It is another if this
disagreement is worsened by promises previously made which are summarily
ignored. It has just complicated matters. Put quite simply, the executive
promised traditional leaders, before the 2000 local government elections,
that the local government powers they enjoyed would be returned to them by
way of Parliament passing legislation before the elections, and that
thereafter a process would be put into motion to finally address their
powers and functions, which powers and functions would be greater than they
had at the time.

From that moment on, Government turned its back on its promises.
Legislation was indeed introduced before the elections, but this was a
perfunctory exercise, and a botched one at that which fooled no one and
embarrassed the Government. It bore no relation to the agreement and went
nowhere. Thereafter not even a pretence was made of complying with the
agreement. So here we are, two and a half years after the promises made
before the local government elections, with no indication of any serious
engagement taking place on this matter.

In conclusion, Deputy Chair, Government should come clean and put the
matter to rest. We believe it has long ago made up its mind on the policy
matters involved, and has further drafted legislation to give effect to
this. Year after year, we go through the pretence that there is a process
which could result in Government somehow changing its mind. How can it be
that a few days ago we were told that the White Paper is expected this very
month when a key consultative committee established by the Minister has not
even met yet? Is this vaguely compatible with the good faith process? What
is to be said about the imminent release of the White Paper? Clearly
nothing ... [Time expired.]

Mr A G LYLE: Deputy Chairperson, it is a universally held belief that since
our first democratic election this country has undergone a fundamental,
political, social and economic transformation, a transformation that
demands from its citizenry two important elements, nurturing and defending.

We cannot divorce the depiction that I have just outlined from a well
resourced and skilled nation. Clearly, skills, development and capacity-
building cannot be overemphasised, particularly in the realm of
developmental local government.

Certainly, the SA Local Government Association and the local government
water Seta have a major role to play in this regard. We take note of the
challenging problems that the Seta encountered during its restructuring
phase from a nondemocratic, nontransparent and exclusive institution into a
democratic, transparent, inclusive and consultative training institution.

To the Seta we would like to convey the following: With the restructuring
almost complete, the Seta is now poised to embark on a training programme
with much more vigour and precision. Our study tour of municipalities in
January this year revealed amongst other things that the following areas
need to be urgently addressed by the Seta: The failure of the local
government and water Seta to perform its role effectively; capacity-
building and training programmes are not providing effective training and
thus not having the desired results; and there needs to be more effective
co-ordination and co-operation between the local government capacity-
building and training role-players.

Our portfolio committee undertook to convene a workshop with all role-
players on 21 May 2003 to examine the capacity-building and training work
that is being done within the sector to assess the impact and identify
measures to be taken to improve the Seta's efficacy. We would like to
reiterate that our portfolio committee stands firm on the conviction that
effective capacity-building and training programmes are indispensable to
the successful implementation of the new system of local government and to
significantly advance delivery, development and democracy.

The Seta made the following presentation outlining its plans that would
strengthen its role and effectiveness, and the implementation of training
programmes, starting this financial year. The Seta has taken a decision to
expand to at least three provinces and indicated that it is planning to use
its funds to increase its support for municipalities so as to enable them
to prepare their work skills plans.

The Seta has identified the following areas as priority: Leadership skills,
strategic planning, finance management, project and contract management,
people management, technical skills, ICT and councillor training. The Seta
looked at the following to improve on delivery, avoid duplications,
synchronise plans, efforts, deliverables and the sharing of resources and
vision.

The local government and water Seta must take the lead as an authority in
this sector in regulating service providers. The following recommendations
related to the Seta were formulated at the workshop: that the Seta must
deal with its organisational issues and take the necessary measures to
improve its performance; strengthen its presence in the provinces and
increase its visibility; increase its attention on areas of priority for
local government transformation including leadership and development; work
together with DPLG and Salga to attend to the municipalities that cannot
pay their levies; and the poor return rate of workplace skills.

Salga is also undergoing restructuring as I speak. The institution made its
presentation at the workshop on its capacity-building strategy and covered
the following areas: Determining needs and competencies; building financial
and fiscal capacity; creating learning organisations; providing on-site
support; measuring and monitoring impact; building individual and
institutional capacity; measuring and monitoring success; and assisting in
restructuring the local government and water Seta.

Furthermore, Salga, with support from the Norwegian Agency of Development
and the Norwegian Association of Regional and Local Authorities, is in the
process of developing and implementing phase two of the core councillor
training programme. The implementation strategy of phase two will focus on
all the 47 district councils by November 2003, and on the local and metro
councils by June 2004.

The content material for phase two will cover the following: local
government legislation; how councils function and the roles of different
stakeholders in council; local government finance and IDPs; project
management and community development skills; labour relations; and
alternative service delivery.

Our portfolio committee assures Salga and the local government and water
Seta of its maximum support. Your failure is our failure. We do not have an
alternative. We must succeed. In conclusion, we wish Salga and the Seta
well in their endeavours. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Mr Deputy Chair. I have recently been appointed by
my party to serve on the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local
Government, but I have had extensive experience as a councillor since 1994,
being part of the evolution of local government in South Africa.

Provincial and local government is born out of a reality that we are one
nation consisting of diverse groups defined by language, culture and
religion. The success of democracy will be determined by our ability to
fete our diversity and not to see it as lines of demarcation. We should
ensure greater integrated governance and planning towards pushing back the
frontiers of poverty. We need to be aware of our historical realities and
deal with them in a responsible and sustained manner.

We need to train a new managerial class. South Africans are now focusing on
the training of a new civil service culture in South Africa. An excellent
report by the Commonwealth's expert Committee on Southern Africa sets out a
detailed rationale for the training needs of the new South Africa together
with imaginative and realistic proposals to finance and implement
educational programmes for post-apartheid skills. The magnitude and urgency
of these needs are enormous. As has often been pointed out, the efforts to
abolish apartheid pale in comparison with the task of coping with its
legacy.

Provincial, and especially local government, are the spheres of government
nearest to the people. It is their activities that affect the lives of
South Africans. Since 1993, we have been developing a model of local and
provincial government that would suit our needs and serve our people. We
now have a system in place where every square metre of this country falls
under the jurisdiction of a local authority.

Financial issues, certainly, constitute the biggest challenge confronting
municipalities. Clearly, there is a need for a new financial system for the
new model of developmental local government.

Most municipalities have a credit control and debt collection policy.
However, they either cannot or do not implement these policies effectively.
Most municipalities are aware that they have to do more to collect the
arrears owed to them for service charges, especially from those who can
afford to pay.

A significant number of municipalities said that they are not yet billing
everybody using services, as they are still gathering information on
residents and do not have proper systems in place. When the committee
visited one area, one councillor said: "The biggest problem is the rural
areas. There is no legal or administrative structure there. No title deeds,
no correct address, a very weak postal service."

Some municipalities admitted they still had different billing systems for
the different areas of the previously existing municipalities that have
been merged. Several municipalities explained that they also lacked
suitably qualified personnel to improve their billing system.
One municipality said that it had two meter readers for over 500 000
people! The meter readers did the billing manually and the mistakes made
reduced the credibility of the bills, serving to discourage residents from
paying. Several municipalities have introduced incentive schemes to
encourage residents to pay. These have had varying degrees of success, but
certainly seem to have potential.

For want of capacity, several municipalities have begun to outsource debt
collection. Some argue that not only is it efficient, but it works out
cheaper for both the municipalities and the debtors, as legal fees are
avoided, and debt collection agencies are paid on the basis of the amount
of the debt retrieved.

One of the most progressive aspects of the new system of local government
is the considerable space it provides for community participation to be
fully implemented. While, clearly, the enormous potential for community
participation is very far from being realised, there has been a fair amount
of progress. The vast majority of municipalities have at least some level
of community participation, and most seem to have established ward
committees. A significant number, indeed, have a council policy on
community participation and on ward committees especially.

Ultimately, the test of the new system of local government will be the
extent to which it leads to substantial improvements in service delivery
and development. While there is significant progress in this regard,
especially in the delivery of free basic services, particularly water,
there is still a long way to go before municipalities effectively fulfil
their responsibilities, and they have to be assisted far more by national
and provincial government and other stakeholders to do this.

The portfolio committee believes that provincial governments have a crucial
role to play in supporting the consolidation of the new system of local
government. Despite their obvious limitations of funds, resources and
personnel, provincial departments of local government and provincial
governments as a whole can do more to assist municipalities without unduly
interfering. National departments should co-operate more with provincial
departments, particularly the provincial departments of local governments,
when they deal directly with municipalities.

A brief overview of the budget: My first concern is the nearly R9 million
nonspending, Mr Minister, on the Commission for the Promotion and
Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities.
Why has this commission not been established? These are constitutional
rights and need to be promoted.

We are glad that the budget is focusing on service delivery. We welcome the
R100 million provided for the delivery of free basic water and electricity.
This is a very cold winter and the poor will need these services. We hope
the target of 28 million people will be reached in 2004.

We believe that local government is autonomous and its integrity should be
respected, but when there are constraints that affect service delivery to
the people, the national and provincial departments should intervene and
give assistance. We therefore welcome the decision to create units on the
Urban Renewal Programme, the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development
Programme, targeted provincial support, intergovernmental fiscal relations
and municipal viability, free basic services and infrastructure, corporate
governance and public participation and empowerment.

The committee pointed out after one of its visits that one of the main
issues that emerged from a recent major study tour it had undertaken of
municipalities was that there was a need for much greater integrated
governance if service delivery and development were to be advanced. The
committee stressed that municipalities generally complained that national
and provincial departments ignored IDPs in their plans, programmes and
projects. The committee felt that the department has to do more to ensure
integrated governance and is to pursue this further with the department.
The committee welcomed the department's focus on the premier's office being
responsible for co-ordinating integrated planning and we hope other
provinces will follow Gauteng's example.

The committee expressed its concern about the capacity of municipalities to
effectively implement the new division of powers and functions between
local and district municipalities to come into effect from 1 July this
year. The committee refers the department to its report, if the department
could please assist local government with recommendations.

Mr Deputy Speaker, we constantly hear the DA criticising this Government in
this House and, Mr Minister, I must inform you, as a nation we are not
where we want to be. There is a lot to be done. There are a lot of
inconsistencies in local government.

There are three local governments that are governed by the DA: One in
Pretoria, where the provincial government is now investigating the DA-led
government; Eskom wants to liquidate it because they cannot pay their
arrears.
The other one is Meyerton in Gauteng where this gentleman comes from, where
the mayor is now town clerk. While being in office, a town clerk position
was created and he was appointed. That is correct.

The third example is that when the DA governed the Western Cape unicity,
their leader said: "This is the shining city on the hill and an example to
all." In the end, Carol Baker of the Sunday Times said: "The DA is lurching
from one failure to the other; they are praying for the New NP and the ANC
to take over." I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Mr Chairperson, we first of all welcome hon Durand as a
member of the portfolio committee and also for his gallant approach to this
debate.

Mr Grobler's remarks that the district councils are not delivering any
services are very far from the truth. District municipalities are
performing an important role in the rural areas and in those areas where
they are surrounded by cash-strapped Category B municipalities. It just
shows how far the DA is removed from reality. [Interjections.]

The hon Seaton says that in ten years no progress has been made. Like Rip
van Winkel of old, she must be sleeping through a revolution not to have
noticed the progress which has been made. On the issue of traditional
leadership, she is merely echoing what the hon Peter Smith would have said
because she herself is not a member of the committee.

Intergovernmental relations is an operational framework through which
Government intends to eradicate the legacy of the past and deliver services
to communities. Through this framework, I can tell you, the ANC-led
Government has achieved much more over the nine years by way of service
delivery.

The opposition can howl as much as they want to, but the fact of the matter
is that the department, through intergovernmental relations, has
contributed a great deal to pushing back the frontiers of poverty by its
service delivery on the ground through both provinces and municipalities.
We who have to deal with the poorest sector of society will vouch for it
that the infrastructure in our communities has changed a great deal.

So in terms of the Constitution, national Government is tasked to develop a
sound IGR system that is conducive to socioeconomic transformation,
assisting municipalities in effecting fundamental change at grassroots
level. I quote from the FFC as follows:


  The structures designed to promote co-operative governance have served to
  overcome many challenges to the effective functioning of the IGR system.
  It is important to ensure that these structures continue to involve,
  evolve and operate effectively.

Of course, the IGR system evolved in an informal manner since 1994. The
network of institutions played an important role in planning, co-ordinating
and executing Government functions. A comprehensive assessment of IGR was
undertaken and this informed the IGR legislation that will come before the
committee later this year.

Chair, we are aware of the many challenges which face intergovernmental
relations. These include, amongst other things, important concepts such as
co-operation, alignment and co-ordination that will have to be defined. As
there is no legal framework for dispute settlement between spheres as
required by the Constitution, this should feature strongly in the
forthcoming legislation. In addition to aligning IGR with provincial growth
and development planning, the department mentioned that it would introduce
targeted support programmes to provinces because of their supportive role
in the IGR.

The co-ordination of IGR with provinces and with national Government is of
great importance. The interaction of departments within a province must be
spearheaded by the premier's office, precisely because that office is the
nucleus of the provincial executive. Minister, if the IGR needs to be
aligned with the provincial growth and development planning, then surely
the municipal Integrated Development Plans, IDPs, must also come into the
picture, because it is going to show that the IDPs are not just wish lists,
as some councillors would put it, but that it would be followed by
development in all the municipalities.

I want to suggest that both provincial and national departments plan their
programmes and projects in such a manner that it would be consistent with a
municipality's IDP. This co-ordination is of great importance to the IGR.

I would like to stress that co-operative governance is not just the
interaction between departments and spheres of government but it is also
about ensuring that the structures of government serve the purposes and
priorities of Government. It actually means that each person who is a cog
in the wheel of service delivery is accountable and must therefore take
responsibility.

During our recent study tour of municipalities, we found that relations
between municipalities and provinces were fair to good actually. However,
we want to see a situation where provinces are much more involved in what
is transpiring in the municipalities, especially since they have an
oversight role to play.

Many municipalities echo the sentiment that they are in need of more
support from provinces. Provinces should not just stand on the sidelines
and watch local government do its thing. On the contrary, they need to
assist municipalities with capacity-building as part of their involvement
in the affairs of local government.

Minister, during our study tour to municipalities early in the year, our
group visited the Northern Cape. We were taken on a tour of the Galeshewe
node. Galeshewe has undergone a complete transformation from what it used
to be in the past. I was absolutely thrilled to see all the changes that
have taken place. To crown it all, the new legislature of the Northern Cape
is situated right in the heart of Galeshewe. All these spheres of
government are involved in the department of the node and, to me, this is a
shining example of intergovernmental relations being successful.

However, when we visited a node in Mitchells Plain and Guguletu a few days
later, we found to our horror that the DA did not even bother to lift a
finger in order to develop those areas. It is only now that the coalition
is in place that things are happening in that node.

We have heard how negative the hon Grobler was. I am sure that his
colleague, the hon Willem Doman, formerly from the New NP is going the same
route. The Word says `you go over land and see to make one proselyte, and
once you have him, it becomes twice as bad as what you are'. The ANC
supports the Vote.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, hon
members, hon Minister, the President, in his state of the nation address in
February this year said:


  Over the past few years we have worked hard to lay the basis of the
  advances we must make to meet the goal of a better life for all. At the
  centre of this, are the related objectives of the eradication of poverty
  and the fundamental transformation of our country into one that is
  nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous.

At the World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg last
year, we recognised poverty eradication as one of the essential
requirements for sustainable development. We also recognised the reality
that as a global society, we are endowed with the resources to address the
challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development.

We expressed our resolve to increase access to basic requirements such as
clean water, sanitation, adequate shelter, energy, healthcare, food
security and protection of biodiversity. We also agreed to provide
assistance to increase income-generating employment opportunities and to
strengthen governance at all levels for the effective implementation of
local agenda 21, the Millennium Development Goals and the Johannesburg Plan
of Implementation.
The first goal of the Millennium Development Goal is that of eradicating
extreme poverty and hunger. It aims to halve the proportion of people who
live on less than R1 100 a month by the year 2015.

One of the important commitments made by the WSSD in respect of Africa was
to support the New Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad. In Nepad,
we believe that the development of Africa is ultimately the responsibility
of Africans themselves. One of the underlying objectives for the
establishment of Nepad is to eradicate poverty and place our countries,
individually and collectively, on the path of sustainable growth and
development. We realise that these twin objectives of eradicating poverty
and fostering socioeconomic development are possible through the
application of democracy and good governance.

It is these same challenges that we addressed at the recent Growth and
Development Summit, the GDS, held in Johannesburg. Part of the vision of
the GDS is the creation of a society in which there are economic
opportunities for all, poverty is eradicated, income inequalities are
reduced and basic services are available to all. These objectives at the
level of the WSSD, Nepad and the GDS reaffirm the strategic goals and
objectives of our Government to eradicate poverty and create a better life
for all.

As we review the past nine years of our democratic state, and the
challenges that we still face, we pause to reflect on some of the
historical truths. Colonialism and apartheid left behind a legacy of
inequality, poverty, underdevelopment and poor services. This legacy was so
deeply entrenched and continues to manifest itself in the form of
infrastructural backlogs, skewed spatial developments and a huge skills
deficit that we confront. Our ANC-led Government came into power with a
clear mandate - to find innovative solutions to redress these injustices.

It is important to bear this history in mind when assessing the progress
made in reaching our targets and in understanding the challenges that this
Government still faces. In the past nine years, we have put in place
concerted programmes to undo the damage caused by decades of apartheid
policies.

I recently had the opportunity of addressing the Department of Politics and
Governance at one of our universities and, in our discussion about
Government's transformation programme, it became clear to me that there is
a grave lack of understanding among some of our young people of the true
history of our country and of our people. They just could not understand
why it is taking so long to achieve this better life for all. It is
important that as we celebrate Youth Day, we encourage them to learn about
and appreciate our history as they are our leaders of tomorrow.

Our vision was clearly expressed at the Congress of the People in Kliptown
on 26 June 1955, when the Freedom Charter was adopted. Prof Wilson and Dr
Ramphele, in their book entitled Uprooting Poverty: The South African
Challenge said, and I quote:


  The Congress of the People crystallised thinking at the time of
  formulating the Freedom Charter, which focused not only on political
  power and the rule of law, but also on the need for redistribution of
  wealth, including land, and the banishment of famine.

Using the Freedom Charter as a basis, the ANC developed the Reconstruction
and Development Programme which identified the basic principles, which the
Minister referred to earlier, to address the problems of poverty and gross
inequality. This programme was adopted by the new democratic Government.
The central objective is to improve the quality of the lives of all South
Africans and, in particular, the most poor and marginalised sections of our
community.

The system of government that we have created has been designed with the
express intention of addressing these imbalances. During the period 1994-
2002, the focus of Government has been on establishing the policy,
legislation and institutional machinery of Government to implement the
three-sphere system of government established by our Constitution. During
the next three years, 2003 to 2006, the emphasis will be on making the
three spheres of government work more efficiently and effectively to
improve service delivery.

The mandate of our Ministry and department is to facilitate and promote co-
ordination among national departments, provincial governments and local
governments to provide support to provincial and local governments in
fulfilling their constitutional mandates. As the sphere closest to the
people, our intergovernmental system places local government at the
frontline of Government's delivery machinery, providing basic household
infrastructure and services to all our people. Our mandate places us at the
coalface of Government's interaction with municipalities.

The budget for this financial year has been increased by 43% to R9,4
billion. The bulk of this amount will be utilised for capacity-building in
order to bring services closer to the people at the local level. Building
the capacity of municipalities remains a major area of intervention for our
Ministry and department. We are placing special emphasis on building the
capacity of women in local government. The challenge for the next few years
will be on consolidating the various capacity-building grants and targeting
these towards building systems for development planning, financial
management and performance management. One of the initiatives we will be
embarking on is the local government leadership academy.

At the heart of poverty eradication and development is access to
infrastructure. Through the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Framework,
the MIIF, the department monitors and quantifies the extent of
infrastructure backlogs for water, sanitation, roads, stormwater and waste
removal in each province. The MIIF estimates the total municipal
infrastructure investment necessary to eliminate these backlogs as anything
between R38 billion to R53 billion, or an annual amount of over R10
billion. These backlogs have to be contrasted against the investment that
Government makes towards municipal infrastructure provision. This year we
will be revising and updating our statistics on infrastructure backlogs for
the country.

The capital investment grants that have been introduced to deal with these
backlogs include the CMIP, the Community-Based Public Works Programme, the
community water supply and sanitation and the national electrification
programme. The CMIP is one of the largest capital programmes providing
funds for bulk and connector municipal infrastructure. For example, a total
of 315 projects covering key sectors such as water, sanitation, roads and
lighting were completed in 2002-03 through the CMIP programme. The
allocation for this programme alone totals R2,3 billion for the year 2003-
04, an increase of about 25% on last year's allocation of R1,7 billion.

The substantial increases over the past years in the CMIP allocation point
to our commitment to addressing underdevelopment and changing the lives of
those marginalised by the previous apartheid dispensation. One of our most
outstanding flagship CMIP projects to date is the Umtata Peri-Urban Water
Project which, since its inception, has been driven by the local community.
Members of the community who served on the project committee and workers
have received training in a range of skills including project management,
pipe laying and operation and maintenance. The project is expected to yield
long-term positive results in the general health of the people, especially
women who will now be able to use time spent collecting water for income-
generating activities.

The fact that we have all these municipal infrastructure grant programmes
administered by different departments, all with different programmatic and
reporting requirements for local government, points to some of the
inefficiencies we still have in the system. Different infrastructure grants
result in poor planning and budgeting and therefore undermine our efforts
at integrated service delivery in an effort to promote efficiency in
infrastructure delivery.

Cabinet has approved the consolidation of the different grants into what is
termed the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Grant. The department will
be piloting the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Grant in a select
number of municipalities. In this way, the infrastructure transfers will go
directly to local government in support of the IDPs.

In addressing the dehumanising effects of deprivation and poverty, we need
to address the restoration of dignity of the lives of the people. In our
effort to provide our people with access to basic services previously
denied, we remain committed to Cabinet's decision in 2001 to provide free
basic water and electricity. Although substantial investments in
infrastructure at local level have been made since 1994, the policy is
being implemented on a progressive basis as infrastructure and capacity is
being put in place at the local level. An amount of R1 billion will be
invested towards infrastructure provision for free basic services.

Free basic water was introduced in July 2001 and free basic electricity
roll-out will commence on 1 July 2003. The good news is that in the
metropolitan and larger municipalities, this has already been implemented.
Our focus in providing a better life extends beyond putting infrastructure
in place to giving people the opportunity to become economically active
and, in this way, contribute to the economic growth of our country. An
amount of R120 million has been allocated for this financial year to our
Local Economic Development Programme.

One of the exciting and innovative projects we visited this year funded
through LED is the Silobela Agri-Business in Carolina, Mpumalanga, which
uses hydroponics to grow strawberries and other products for the local
market and their dealers. We will be visiting other projects during this
year. We are also planning to visit Kwazulu-Natal and the O R Tambo rural
district.

Our system of local government is also designed to ensure community
participation and to give effect to our objective of people-centred and
people-driven development. People in our wards must be able to mobilise
sufficient development resources from Government where necessary.

Once again, I would like to thank members of Parliament and the portfolio
committee for their unwavering support and the tremendous work that the
portfolio committee has done by visiting the municipalities. I would like
to thank the DG, Ms Lindi Msengana-Ndlela and her team for the sterling
work they have done in turning around the department to become more
dedicated, professional and goal-oriented. I also want to thank the
Ministry's staff for their co-operation and support. We also want to
express our thanks to Salga, the premiers, MECs, mayor, councillors, Inkosi
and all our strategic partners who have engaged us and supported us
throughout this period. Most importantly, I would like to thank the
Minister, Comrade Sydney Mufamadi, for his leadership, guidance and
support. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.].

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chairman, the new developmental mandate on local
government has placed greater emphasis and urgency on the fiscal review,
integration and co-ordination of the three spheres of government.

Amalgamation, unfunded mandates, powers and functions of local and district
councils, poor billing and data systems and nonpayments are but a few of
the challenges that local government faces in order to deliver effective
and efficient service delivery. What further exacerbates the viability,
capacity and management is the limited revenue-raising abilities of
municipalities. Property rates, if I may add, are not going to be the
answer to strengthen revenue-raising capacities of municipalities.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Southgate, can you please take
your seat.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Chairperson, the hon member is reflected on the screen as
the Minister for Intelligence, hon Sisulu. Can this be corrected please?
Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: This is presently being corrected.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Probably a prophesy.

The ACDP is concerned about the nonmaterialising of the many promises that
were made by the Minister and his department to table legislation with
regard to the rightful role of traditional authorities in local government.
Failure of the department to ensure proper co-operation between
municipalities and traditional authorities in rural areas has resulted in
poor service delivery in those areas.

The increases in the equitable share over the MTEF period are totally
insufficient. If local government is to be the main agent of delivery, then
the cut of the pie for the equitable share to local government should be
larger than that of its counterparts in order for it to align to its
developmental mandate.

The R24 billion debt of which a large portion is nonrecoverable and will be
written-off further impacts on annual budgets of municipalities. Revenue
budgets are prepared with the assumption of collection and when unable to
collect, it forces municipalities to erode the surplus, or access bank
overdrafts to finance the shortfall. This compromises investor and consumer
confidence. Therefore all three must improve their image in the public eye.
They must lead by example, by paying their debts in the agreed timeframes.
If not, stiffer penalties must be invoked against defaulters.

The increase in the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme which
is aimed at rehabilitation and upgrading of basic infrastructure is
welcomed. These initiatives include plans of management and sustainability
with finances targeting specific projects in the various nodal points.
However, very little or no development has been planned for poverty pockets
in urban and rural areas, thus causing inner city decay and rural
impoverishment. [Time expired.]

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Chairperson, I stand here in support of today's budget on
behalf of the African National Congress.

Let me take you through the following as I dedicate this speech to the
youth of this country, the people of Evaton in the Vaal in particular and
the poor people of this country. I pledge my Government's commitment to the
extension and improvement of free basic services to all residents of this
country.

The youth of today should know that colonial rule and apartheid rule denied
their parents and grandparents the following: the democratic right to
choose what is good for them, economic and social justice, and human
dignity, and they were displaced, let alone being humiliated and degraded.
The past has today left us with no development and extreme underdevelopment
both in rural and predominantly black areas. These areas are characterised
by social and economic infrastructure that is unintegrated. They have
infrastructure that is environmentally unsustainable, of poor quality, of
unequal distribution and underutilised. It must be noted that without good
infrastructure in place, there is no way that we can have qualitative and
quantitative service delivery.

The challenge facing the ANC-led Government today does not exclude the
following: poor co-ordination in the development of new infrastructure poor
quality of infrastructure provision, lack of sustainability resulting from
lack of adequate operating planning and maintenance; industralisation that
led to urbanisation which resulted in urban sprawl and growth in informal
settlements and overutilisation of consultants without political content.
Hence we now have an estimated R170 billion of infrastructure investment
backlog.

It takes only a movement of the ANC's calibre and status to manage the
situation that I have just outlined. It is the ANC-led Government that has
policies that impact on the lives of people of this country, especially the
poor. It is the ANC-led Government that has constitutional guarantees based
on the Bill of Rights. It is also the ANC that laid the foundation for
people-centred and participatory democracy where all citizens are included
in the planning of the development of their areas. Of course, it is only
the ANC-led Government that has a developmental government, for example,
through IDPs.

It is true that we are on course. When our President, Thabo Mbeki, made a
call in the ANC Manifesto in 1999 for us to fight for change together he
said, and I quote:


  Our challenge for the next five years is to use the experience we have
  gained, the policies we have put in place and institutions of democracy
  we have created to bring about even greater change than we have achieved
  in the first five years.

The nation listened, and the department listened as it is led by Minister
Mufumadi who acted accordingly. The above commitment is justified by the
department's going through the following transformation stages as mentioned
earlier: the stabilisation phase, the consolidation phase and the
sustainability phase which, of course, entails a clear delivery mandate,
targeted reliable data and outcomes-based performance in the delivery of
free basic services.

Never was so much done by so progressive a government for so many within
such a short time. The key priorities for municipalities include expansion
of their capacity to provide services particularly free basic services
which include the implementation of policy that came into effect on 1 July
2001.

In order for the local and provincial governments to fulfil their mandate,
national Government has allocated funds for the distribution of free basic
services and many others that have been mentioned by the Deputy Minister.
Free basic services translate into the following: the provision of 6
kilolitres of free water to all households. It must be noted that clean
water is the most significant resource for reducing poverty and diseases
and improving quality of life.

To meet the challenge, coherent policy and a regulatory framework that is
appropriate to the physical realities of the South African situation should
be established. Hence it is important that institutional support be
provided. We must know that unplanned settlements and overrunnings,
resulting in a run-off into nearby streams and rivers, has led to a high
level of cholera and aggravated the sanitation problem. The Department of
Water Affairs and Forestry and the Department of Local and Provincial
Government are in agreement that the issue of water transfer shall be dealt
with without compromising the delivery thereof.

About one third of municipalities outside Gauteng currently provide their
whole jurisdiction with services. My district, Sedibeng, which is in
Gauteng South, provides free basic water to all municipalities except for
areas where there is no infrastructure. The free basic service policy does
not extend to sanitation beyond provision of basic levels on inside
sanitation such as the Ventilated Improved Pit system (VIP) which has
minimal operational costs.

Delivery in rural areas remains a challenge as identified by the
presidential and ministerial imbizos throughout the country. The issue of
water losses also is a challenge due to the old inappropriate worn-out
infrastructure that needs to be replaced.

To have electricity as Government's priority towards the provision of free
basic services is an advantage both economically and socially. Fifty
kilowatts per month for grid connection will also be provided whilst we
note that 3,5 million homes have been electrified since 1994 when the ANC
took over. Government has allocated R300 million for the provision of free
basic electricity to poor households nationally.

The provision of free basic electricity in terms of grid-connected
customers will be made on a self-targeting basis where poor households
choose to benefit from subsidies subject to being connected to the reduced
level of supply. Eskom must also note that it plays a crucial role. The
challenge facing municipalities is to ensure the smooth roll-out of free
basic services including electricity. However, some municipalities provide
certain levels of kilowatts free. We have to commend Stellenbosch for
providing 70% free. Polokwane does it according to the household.

I wish to thank the President for visiting my constituency, which is
Evaton, last year. We should be celebrating the centenary next year which
is characterised by resistance to forced removals. I must also thank
Minister Thoko Didiza for having considered celebrating 90 years of
resistance to forced removals in Evaton next week on 17 June.

In closing, I must note that the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and
Local Government has made a recommendation, which I believe has been
covered earlier on. Amongst others is the recommendation that in some
municipalities, for example, the issue of bucket systems and pit systems of
sanitation needs to be dealt with. It is only through strong and effective
ward committees that IDPs, which are the best component of our budget, can
reflect the very basic needs I have mentioned. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chair, the 1998 local government White Paper sought to
draw attention to the fact that local government should be developmental,
meaning that it is a process. Out of that has come the wall-to-wall
municipalities that blanket the country at present.

Developmental local government should be committed to working with citizens
and groups within the community to find sustainable ways to meet the
social, economic and material needs of these people in order to improve the
quality of their lives. In attempting to establish the extent to which
municipalities are committed to working with people, we noticed that the
ward committees have been established. Though such committees are primarily
the preserve and responsibility of ward councillors, we maintain that list
councillors should also call meetings, just like members of Parliament,
although elected through the party list.

The code of conduct, as set out in the legislation, is meant to govern the
behaviour of councillors, but unfortunately, a good number of councillors
continue to be found on the wrong side of the law. The high number of
mayors who have been removed from office because of unbecoming conduct
comes to mind.

Amalgamating councils and reducing them from 843 to 284 is in itself a
challenge. Not much thought was given to the scale of the administrative
integration process that would come as a result of demarcation. The
integration of the administrative, financial and information technology
systems of municipalities that were autonomous has been complex, time-
consuming and difficult, but we hope that it will be pushed into place.
In many municipalities the financial reserves of all councils with positive
bank balances have been used to settle the debts of bankrupt councils. The
selection of municipal managers has not given rise to optimism about the
general skill level of municipal managers rising to justify the salaries
they receive. It is not without reason that the hon Minister of Finance, on
the occasion of his Budget Speech, spoke strongly against the inflated
remuneration packages some of these officials receive or allocate to
themselves.

We are aware that such appointments are justified in terms of affirmative
action, but deplore the fact that others are based on political patronage
from the majority party. [Time expired.]

Mr B M SOLO: Chairperson, Ministers and Deputy Ministers that are here, hon
members, allow me to acknowledge the presence of Sister Bernard Ncube, the
executive mayor of the West Rand District Council, who was a member of this
committee, and also the presence of Mrs Martie Wenger, the mayor of Midvaal
Local Council, a constituency I serve.
As part of fighting poverty and speeding up development, the President
announced a specific, focused programme. This programme is known as the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme and the Urban Renewal
Programme. Doubting Thomases were then cynical, negative and full of
contempt. Today we are proud to say these programmes have made significant
strides in realising their objectives and are firmly on the right path to
sustainable development. We can safely say that, indeed, the tide has
turned.

The debate on the Vote today actually gives effect to the fact that this
ANC-led Government is indeed moving in a systematic and sustainable manner
to ensure a better life, particularly for the poor, powerless, previously
neglected and destitute masses of our people who have been subjected to
conditions of squalor, poverty and misery.

Resources have been set aside to ensure that this programme benefits a wide
range of the poor communities. As we see in CMIP funding, considerable
amounts have been allocated to rural projects. About R307 million will be
allocated to the 13 development nodes in 55 local municipalities.
The implementation of anchor projects, the allocation of specific funds in
terms of this budget, and the combined resources from the three spheres of
government that have been brought together demonstrate the importance of
intergovernmental relations.

The department has moved further to set up a unit that would be solely in
charge of these programmes. This demonstrates the seriousness and the
commitment of the ANC-led Government to pushing back the frontiers of
poverty.

As indicated already, most of these anchored programmes have been
implemented. Of course, there are others that are struggling to get off the
ground for various reasons. In the report on the municipalities we visited,
which we recently tabled in this House, we made mention of four urban nodes
that we had been able to visit.

The success of these programmes lies solely in integrated development
planning. These programmes should not be seen as isolated, technocratic,
academic exercises as they deal with the lives of the people. Accordingly,
community participation through your IDP processes, ward committees and
other engagements becomes critical. We call upon all key stakeholders such
as the Umsobomvu Fund, the National Coalition for Municipal Service
Delivery and departments with poverty alleviation programmes to materially
support these programmes.

As a committee we agree with the department that the key challenges are to
get the three spheres of government to co-operate around the budgeting and
planning of these key government initiatives, and to strengthen the
management of the programmes in the various nodes. From what we observed
during our tour, we are impressed with the enormous progress made in some
of these nodes.

Ngoba sithetha esikwaziyo, singqine esikubonile. E-Kimberly sibonile
kakuhle abantu benyakazela bemaxhaphetshu, bebhinqele phezulu besebenza,
kwaye besebenza ngokuzithemba nokukhuthala okukhulu. [As we talk about what
we know and attest to what we saw, in Kimberley we clearly saw people
moving about, having their hands full, busy at work, and working with
confidence and great diligence.]

Kubalulekile kanti futhi kusemqoka ukuthi abantu bakithi lapha eNingizimu
Afrika, babonakale bebamba iqhaza elibalulekile emathubeni amahle
kaHulumeni ohlelo oluhlelekile lomgomo wokuthuthukisa umnotho wezwe.
Kubalulekile kakhulu ukuba abantu batholakale beziqhenya ngokuzibiza ngawo
lo mnotho abazenzele wona njengokusho komqulu weFreedom Charter othi,
"Abantu bazobusa", bawakhe ngokwabo lo mnotho wakithi. Alikho iqiniso
eledlula lelo, siyabusa vele.

Okubalulekile kakhulu ukuthi uhulumeni, izakhamuzi kanye nomphakathi
kudingekile ukuthi balwe nobubha kanye nobuphofu behlangene beyimbumba.
Kulobo bumnyama bempi yethu yokuxosha ikati eziko, sizoyinqoba indlala

Njengoba sonke sazi ukuthi uHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose unenqubomgomo

Makube umsebenzi wethu sonke ukuzinikela ekuqapheleni ubudlova obenziwa

Isabiwozimali esiqhuba ngaso kulezi zinsuku siyathembisa ukuthi sizozifeza
izinhloso zethu ngokwecebo likahulumeni. Uhlelo oluhlelekile oluzimele
lokuphucula impilo yasemakhaya nasemadolobheni luyingxenye efakazela
uHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose. Abampofu bazozuza kakhulu uma nje

paragraphs follows.)

[It is very important that our people here in South Africa are seen to be
playing a very important role, in respect of good opportunities that the
Government creates for a programme of developing the country's economy. It
is also very important that people take pride in the very same economy they
created for themselves, as the Freedom Charter states that "the people
shall govern" and create this economy on their own. There is no truth above
that one. Of course, we are governing.
What is important is that the Government, citizens and the community must
fight against poverty jointly. In the end we will come out victorious
against this hunger, which is confronting this country. It will be like a
dream.

As we all know, the ANC-led Government has a policy on the alleviation of
hunger. Therefore, it is imperative that everybody makes a contribution.
Let us make it our responsibility and commitment to watch out for bad
behaviour from the people who have bad intentions.

Our budget that we are using these days promises that we will achieve our
goals according to the Government's plan. A well-planned programme of
developing the lives of the people of rural and urban areas serves as a
testimony to the ANC-led Government. The poor will benefit only if there is
a genuine commitment. We have already spoken about Kimberley.]

In Alexander, Johannesburg, more than 3 000 jobs have been created through
the Urban Renewal Project. The road leading to Rooseveldt Bridge has been
rehabilitated. The removal of the informal settlement on the Jukskei River
banks has led to the greening of the river banks. A Pan-African Square has
been constructed to provide formal and informal trading space.

We all know about the new police station, which was officially opened at
the beginning of this year. Thirteen primary schools and five secondary
schools have been repaired and/or renovated. Four new schools have been
built with one of the schools being for people with disabilities.

Recently, at a big community meeting, an evaluation of the development was
done. Interestingly, it was attended by none other than Prof Sangweni, the
hon MPs Johnny Mohlala and Baloyi, and MPLs Bob Mabaso and Stewart Ngwenya,
the chairs of the housing and local government standing committees
respectively.

So this budget, as it is, guarantees that we continue with the good work as
more nodal areas will still be identified. The committee is still to visit
nodes in the year 2004, so that when we stand here, we are able to say,
"Sithetha esikwaziyo, singqine esikubonile" [We talk about what we know, we
testify to what we have seen.]

We must distinguish lies from truth, and separate liars from those who are
honest. We must expose those who want to stall development and progress;
those who, by using various means, make it difficult to have these
programmes successfully implemented; those who distort the facts, and those
who come with excuses when they fail to carry out their functions.

Through this budget we are able to say that, indeed, the tide has turned.
Enkosi. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, every resident of Acacia Park must have
realised the importance of this department when we experienced a lengthy
power failure last night, and I believe it's still in progress as I speak.
I still think the hon Minister organised the whole thing to coincide with
and stress the importance of his Vote today. [Laughter.]

However, on behalf of the NA I want to focus, not on local government, but
on the section 185 Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the
Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities. As it is on the
verge of being established, it is of paramount importance to revisit the
real purpose of the commission and to see to it that this purpose is served
and reflected in the compilation of the commission. In this regard I must
recall and mention the excellent way in which committee chairperson Yunus
Carrim did it in his introduction to the public hearings on the Bill. He
was right on the spot.

In 1993 we in South Africa reached a politically negotiated settlement.
There were basically three large groups involved in the new deal: black
people who were brought into the democratic system based on one
nationality, liberal whites who sought the protection of individual human
rights only, and Afrikaners and a few other communities who felt very
strongly about the right to cultural, linguistic and religious self-
determination.

Those who negotiated for the right to self-determination to be enshrined in
the Constitution were then led to believe that certain sections were
included to accommodate them. These included sections 30 and 31 on the
right to cultural and religious self-determination, section 235 on
territorial self-determination and, of course, section 185.

The Volkstaat Council, directly linked to the right to self-determination,
was established, and eventually abolished. Section 235 was never
implemented. What remains to be seen now, is what Government is going to do
with section 185, it being probably the only section in the Constitution
that gives hope that the desires and expectations of those who are in need
of some form of self-determination will be met.

Treating the section 185 commission in a manner inconsistent with the
political negotiation process which forms the context of the commission
would and could only further alienate those who are proponents of self-
determination, and it would be detrimental to the process of nation-
building in South Africa.

Yes, we know there will and must be a solid contingent from the Afrikaner
community on the commission, but, hon Minister, to appoint Afrikaners who
have never placed a high premium on the right to self-determination would
be utterly counterproductive. To appoint "Oubaas-se-honne" [subservient]
persons, who in fact yield to the wishes of Government more than serve the
rights of communities will, from an Afrikaner point of view, make a mockery
of the commission.

Ek wil my dan ook vanaf hierdie podium wend tot leidende rolspelers in
Afrikanergeledere. Hierdie kommissie bied aan Afrikaners die uitdaging om
'n Afrikanerraad of -rade daar te stel wat by die kommissie kan registreer,
maar 'n oorhaastige poging om 'n Afrikanerraad saam te flans en te
registreer wat selektief net 'n deel van die gemeenskap verteenwoordig,
gaan die hele proses verongeluk.

Enige poging om die proses vanuit 'n bepaalde hoek te kaap sal vernietigend
wees. Onthou, "structure follows strategy". Laat die Afrikanergemeenskap
eers wyd beraadslaag, 'n deeglike oudit maak van alle relevante liggame,
hulle voluit betrek, 'n proses van interne onderhandeling voer - 'n soort
van grootste gemene deler bepaal - om dan uiteindelik die struktuur, 'n
Afrikanerraad, daar te stel en te registreer wat helend, en nie verdelend
nie, sal wees.

Ek wil ook 'n beroep doen op die Minister en op die te stigte kommissie om
nie sommer die eerste die beste aansoek te aanvaar wat voorgee om 'n
verteenwoordigende Afrikanerraad te wees nie. Vra liewer eers vir my - ek
ken die hele boksemdais! [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek dank u. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I also want to address leading role-players in the Afrikaner community
from this podium. This commission offers Afrikaners the challenge of
establishing an Afrikaner council or councils which can register with the
commission, but a too hasty effort to throw together and register an
Afrikaner council which selectively only represents part of the community
will derail the whole process.

Any effort to hijack the process from a particular camp will be
destructive. Remember, "structure follows strategy". Let the Afrikaner
community first consult widely, make a thorough audit of all relevant
bodies, involve them fully, conduct a process of internal negotiation -
determine a sort of greatest common denominator - before eventually
establishing and registering the structure, an Afrikaner council, which
will be healing and not divisive.

I also want to appeal to the Minister and the commission to be established
not to simply accept the first application which purports to be a
representative Afrikaner council. Rather ask me first - I know the whole
caboodle! [Interjections.] I thank you.]
I just want to apologise, hon Minister, for not being able to stay for your
reply, because I have to catch a plane to Pretoria. Thanks.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Why?

Mr C AUCAMP: Constituency work! [Laughter.]

Chief M NONKONYANA: Chairperson, hon members and distinguished guests,
amongst whom are traditional leaders, MECs, mayors, mayoresses and other
councillors - indeed, our foot soldiers are here - the department, mindful
of its constitutional mandate, has established departmental units or
divisions, and each unit or division has its key performance area and
measurable objectives. These must be, of course, within the budget approved
by this Parliament.

Our portfolio committee is entrusted, of course, with the task of
overseeing the overall performance of this department in accordance with
the principles of transparency and accountability. In support of this Vote,
I will deal with the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme and
the Local Economic Development and Social Plan Grant, which are two major
subprogrammes of the Governance and Development Programme. The expenditure
on the Governance and Development Programme is projected to increase by
31,3% during this financial year, and it is expected that this will
increase in the next financial year.

I'm impressed by the rural bias of this budget. [Interjections.] For
instance, in this booklet, I am told that R1,2 billion of the CMIP will be
allocated to rural projects. Of the above amount from the CMIP,
R307,7 million will go towards 13 nodes in 55 municipalities next year.
Above all, R26,7 million of the Local Economic Development Fund will go
towards the rural nodes, unlocking agricultural and tourism potential.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

I am also impressed because, in addition to this, the department has
actually produced a strategy plan for 2003 to 2006, setting out its
strategies to address poverty, especially in our rural areas. This of
course reflects the increases in the allocations of the CMIP and Local
Economic Development Grant, which are key poverty alleviation initiatives.
These are in line with the ANC's determination to push back the frontiers
of poverty.

The Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme allocation includes
R1 billion over the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period for the
provision of labour-based infrastructure investment and services to help
stimulate and support local economic development. These subprogrammes are
to be amalgamated and, along with other local government infrastructure
grants, will form part of the new Municipal Infrastructure Grant in the
next financial year.

I now wish to deal specifically with the Consolidated Municipal
Infrastructure Programme. The purpose of this programme is to fund
municipalities to enable them to provide bulk, connector infrastructure and
community facilities to poor households, as the Deputy Minister has
correctly pointed out. These funds may only be used for the specific
municipal infrastructure investment intended.

The programme will also provide for new infrastructure, and for the
rehabilitation and upgrading of existing infrastructure. This programme has
assisted more than 2,5 million households since its introduction, assisting
all municipalities to provide bulk, connector and internal infrastructure
and community facilities that benefit poor households. Projects include
water, sanitation services, roads, storm water infrastructure, solid waste
disposal and community services. Projects typically involve local
contractors and are labour-intensive, targeting women, the youth and the
disabled for employment and training.

The ANC believes that infrastructure is key to social security and economic
development. Approximately 5 million have access to both water and
electricity, and an estimated 3,4 million have access to electricity.
However, be that as it may, the ANC believes that the levels of
underservicing remain high and require an integrated strategy to address
them. Therefore infrastructure delivery must remain Government's key
priority.

Early this year it was a pleasure for me and all the people of the
Nciphizeni locality in the Kwazithathele Administrative area in the
Nyandeni local municipality within the O R Tambo district municipality - I
am happy that the mayoress of O R Tambo is here - when the Minister of
Water Affairs and Forestry, Comrade Ronnie Kasrils, officially opened a tap
with clean water for the first time in the history of that area. Similarly,
the Bhala community within Qaukeni local municipality - I am also happy
that the mayoress is here - has received infrastructure, and clean water
will be available in the course of this year.

Many municipalities have rolled out the Consolidated Municipal
Infrastructure Programme. The ANC is indeed more determined than ever
before to accelerate delivery of a better life for all. [Applause.] We
accordingly hope that in the envisaged elections in 2004, South Africans
will give us the necessary mandate to pursue these programmes by, of
course, doing the right thing and voting ANC. [Interjections.]

The budget for this financial year has been increased and we will increase
it again in the next financial year. Twenty per cent of the funds are set
aside for labour-intensive projects, and we will aim to service 650 000
households per annum. Furthermore, about 400 SMMEs per annum are targeted.

I would now like to turn briefly to local economic development. The purpose
of this grant is to support planning, promotion and implementation of job
creation and poverty alleviation projects within municipalities. The ANC
believes that now is the time for all our communities to rise and seize
developmental opportunities. The Vukuzenzele campaign initiated by our
President ... [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson and Ministers, this department assists and
manages the relationship and interaction between our three spheres of
government, namely national, provincial and local. Since 1994 the
department has successfully established and ensured the implementation of
the three spheres, and has now embarked on stabilising the system of
intergovernmental relations.

With policies, Acts and our national Constitution in place, the MF supports
the department's endeavours in respect of its management of duties. The
ability to maintain independence and yet work together with the spheres of
government is certainly a difficult task but the department has harmonised
this.

Working with the various spheres and maintaining a balance must certainly
be a difficult task but the MF is certain that our national Constitution
assists greatly in this. The plans of the department for the forthcoming
year are very promising and their implementation will depend greatly on
strategy and the utilisation of the budget.

The MF feels that the department's programme of governance and development
is aimed at utilising intergovernmental relations policies and I quote:


  Promotion of integrated planning and delivery to build co-operative and
  integrated governance.

This is crucial in order to strengthen the relationship between the various
spheres of government. This task, however, should be incumbent on all
spheres and departments of Government. By us all initiating and practising
such relations effectively, stability may be reached.

The division of the three spheres are clear-cut in our Constitution, which
may not be disregarded. Respect for this division of power has to be upheld
to ensure our democracy. The MF is pleased at the department's committed
attention to local government statutes.

The budget allocated to this department appears appropriate. The plans of
the department for the utilisation of this budget appear appropriate too.
The MF hopes that the budget will be utilised effectively in delivering
stability within the system of intergovernmental relations.

Minister, asibanike labo abangenazo [let us provide services to those who
do not have]. The MF supports the Vote. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, as a proponent of proposition politics, here
are the statements that I want to make to the hon Minister.

Hon Minister, looking at finance and its regulation within the
municipality, you have done two very good things indeed. I want to welcome,
first of all, the anticorruption unit that is going to come into existence
in July. Very well done, indeed.

Secondly, I want to compliment you for the Local Government: Municipal
Finance Management Act which will enormously tighten up all of the
financial aspects of the different municipalities. That is excellent. Now,
you have two very powerful pieces of legislation and a slew of other
legislation, as other hon members were saying.

Now, here is what I think we will need to do in order to make sure that
these beautiful Acts of Parliament are going to work powerfully. The first
question is: What intervention will be permissible by this House in respect
of the work that is going to be done by the anticorruption unit, seeing
that we are charged in the Constitution with looking after the subject of
oversight.

Secondly, we would like to know something in respect of the rights that
have been built up for ordinary citizens. Now, we have in South Africa some
of the most potent laws empowering ordinary people in these different
municipalities to play a visible role both in directing policy as well as
exercising oversight.

Now, because people do not know about these rights and they are not
sufficiently preached, the problem then arises that municipalities get away
with what they are doing, and I think it is common cause right now that
very many municipalities, when it comes to the procurement of services and
goods, are making certain that they benefit themselves rather than
benefiting the intended beneficiaries.

Now, we need to put a stop to that very quickly in order that the optimal
amount of funds are applied for the purposes for which they should, in the
first place, have gone. So, I would like the hon Minister and his Deputy to
see how we can make these laws work to their total and full potential in
order that municipal government, like the national Government, can practise
total fiscal and financial propriety.

I think the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Act and the
coming into being of the anticorruption unit are going to enormously
strengthen municipal and local governments. For that reason I wish to stand
here and support the Vote for this year. [Applause.]

Mr J M NGUBENI: Chairperson, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members
and local government practitioners present here, in 1943, the ANC annual
conference adopted a document entitled Africans' Claims in South Africa.
This document contains demands for equality and a free democratic South
Africa. But, unfortunately, the then regime led by General Smuts refused to
afford the ANC an audience to present the document.

Twelve years later, in an open field, men and women, young and old, black,
white, coloured and Indian from the length and breadth of South Africa
gathered. They had demands, some written on cardboard, exercise books and
so forth. That was the formal birth of the Freedom Charter, baptised by
popular support and participation.

This characterised the ANC as a product of a given historical period,
firstly formed to unite the African majority in the struggle for equality
and developed to embrace nonracialism. The perspectives from the two
documents and their relevance are better put into perspective by the
President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki. Allow me to quote from the letters from the
President in the first edition of ANC Today:


  Reading the document Africans' Claims in South Africa today, one is
  struck by the clear relationship between this document, the Freedom
  Charter and the Constitution of the democratic South Africa. Once again,
  this emphasises the relevance of the Freedom Charter to what we are
  working to achieve today.

The Freedom Charter says that the people shall govern. That demand has been
achieved. We are governing and the masses are actively participating in
governance issues. Structures are up and running to enable meaningful
participation at all levels of government. Participatory democracy
underpins the fundamental values of the new system of developmental local
government. In the very few years of its existence, it is exciting and
responding fairly well to the needs of the communities and the huge
challenges of the massive social and infrastructural disparities that we
inherited.

This is not a miracle or manna from heaven. These are the perspectives and
demands that characterise the relevance of the Freedom Charter. Do not
forget that the character and the strength of the people's movement, the
ANC, resides in its mass base. It is not coincidental that the ANC
Government in all spheres of government is committed to open and
transparent government that ensures that people are active, critical and
informed, but not passive recipients.

This fundamental democratic principle is evident in that, today, community
participation as a legislative requirement is law but not a choice to any
official, councillor or municipality. Ward committees are legal structures
of local government throughout the country where men, women and all
stakeholders actively participate on issues affecting their daily lives.
These processes further deepen democracy, accelerate transformation and
crush the poverty to which the African majority has been relegated.

It is with pride and admiration, when one drives through the streets of
Cape Town, that one sees posters hanging on the poles that read as follows:


  You have spoken, we listened, now come back for a report back meeting

This tells us that the ANC governs, and it is transparent and accountable
in character and approach.

Community participation is not limited to the areas I have just mentioned.
All the 284 new municipalities have prepared and adopted the Integrated
Development Plans based on formal public participation. As we further
develop a meaningful public input to the IDPS, a unique, innovative ward-
based planning programme has been piloted in Mangaung with very exciting
results. In the same breath, the Imbizo programme is an innovative
programme that has provided communities with the opportunity to be more
involved with governance issues.

All these programmes bear testimony that people are active participants in
governance issues. However, despite all these programmes, participatory
democracy is foreign to or deliberately ignored by the members of the
opposition, since they are true prophets of doom who are unfortunately
occupied with very narrow anti-transformation neoliberal agendas.
[Interjections.]

In fact, when these stereotypes talk about corruption in government, their
notion that blacks are inherently and endemically corrupt reeks of racism,
as does their suggestion that there is some sort of genetic basis for
corruption. Because of these stereotypes, they pretend that they do not
know that it is the ANC that introduced the Scorpions and anticorruption
units. With greater determination to fight corruption, the local government
anticorruption unit will be introduced in the near future.

In conclusion, despite all the negative perceptions about our councils and
also taking into account the huge challenges and the backlogs we inherited,
to millions out there, municipalities have not collapsed. To the poor
disadvantaged communities, the houses provided mean heaven, and proper
sanitation has brought back dignity, the free basic services have improved
the quality of life, and the maintenance and provision of infrastructure
brings hope and the realisation of a better life for all. I support this
Vote. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, the new municipalities came into being
with the local government elections that took place on 5 December 2000.
This dispensation is indeed a new phenomenon in our country. Like all new
structures that are put in place in order to afford greater access by our
people to government services, they are bound to experience some problems.
Bearing this in mind, Azapo is not surprised to find the following issues
that are still prevalent in these spheres of government.

Firstly, Azapo has noticed that community participation is not well
understood by officials and role-players. Some municipalities have
implemented this programme, whilst others have not even begun to take steps
towards implementation. In some rural areas the concept itself has not been
introduced to communities. Ward committees, for example, have not been
established in some areas. Azapo accepts that it takes some time to
complete the process of instituting ward committees. We are, however, of
the opinion that two years is enough for a municipality to have completed
the process of ward committees. This matter must receive your urgent
attention.

In areas where ward committees have been established, some have not been
capacitated. Where capacity-building has taken place, there is a dispute as
to the relevance of specific courses that are meant to empower members of
ward committees. Of importance is the relevance of generic courses to
specific local conditions in different municipalities. Azapo believes that
localised courses are more relevant than courses developed for general use.


Azapo has also observed that there are very few women in management and
senior positions at these municipalities that Azapo visited. To Azapo this
is a serious matter, since it goes against the country's commitment to
advance women in all spheres of life. To Azapo gender equality should be
practised in all spheres of government. We suggest that a gender audit be
conducted in all municipalities so that we can arrest this phenomenon
before it grows out of proportion. [Applause.]

The other aspect that needs urgent attention is the relationship between
traditional rule and traditional practices and elected councillors, as well
as civic associations. During our visits to the Mhinga Traditional
Authority and the Mphephu Traditional Authority, we were pleased to learn
from the solutions that have been implemented by these traditional
authorities. These solutions, in our view, go a long way to harmonise the
concept of elected representation and inherited traditional rule. Those who
believe that traditional rule is always in conflict with democracy are
advised to visit these two traditional authorities.

I support the Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr W P DOMAN: Voorsitter, die Wes-Kaapse Minister van Plaaslike Regering,
mnr Dowry, het Dinsdag die uitvoerende burgemeesterstelsel by al 30
munisipaliteite in die Wes-Kaap ingestel. Self die kleinste munisipale raad
in die land, Laingsburg, wat net ses raadslede het, het nou 'n uitvoerende
burgemeester, sy komitee, 'n uitvoerende onderburgemeester en 'n speaker.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die Wes-Kaap is die enigste provinsie in die land wat hierdie stommiteit
aanvang. Trouens, al ... [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN:  Chairperson, on Tuesday the Western Cape Minister of Local
Government, Mr Dowry, introduced the executive mayor system in all 30
municipalities in the Western Cape. Even the smallest municipal council in
the country, Laingsburg, which has only six councillors, now has an
executive mayor, its committee, an executive deputy mayor and a speaker.
[Interjections.]

The Western Cape is the only province in the country committing this folly.
Indeed, all ... [Interjections.]]

Mr J DURAND: Chair, on a point of order: Will this man, this hon member,
take a question on this issue?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is that no, hon member?

Mr J DURAND: It might be because he is scared. He proposed the system.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Continue, hon Doman.

Mnr W P DOMAN: Voorsitter, trouens, al die ANC-beheerde provinsies het baie
verantwoordelik met die saak gehandel en die bedoeling van die wet
uitgevoer deur die uitvoerende burgemeesterstelsel slegs by enkele groot
rade in te stel. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die ANC moenie toelaat dat die Nuwe NP
hulle so korrupteer hier in die Wes-Kaap nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die doel van Minister Dowry se onverantwoordelike optrede is natuurlik om
vir meer as 90% van die Nuwe NP-raadslede hoër vergoeding te gee, en só te
verseker dat hulle binne die Nuwe NP bly. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die
ondemokratiese wyse waarop hy opgetree het deur vir alle rade net een van
twee keuses te gee ... [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Chairperson, indeed, all the ANC-controlled provinces dealt
with the matter very responsibly and gave effect to the intention of the
Act by introducing the executive mayor system only in a few large councils.
[Interjections.] The ANC should not allow the New NP to corrupt them like
this here in the Western Cape. [Interjections.]

The objective of Minister Dowry's irresponsible action is, of course, to
give over 90% of the New NP councillors higher remuneration, and in this
way to ensure that they remain within the New NP. [Interjections.] The
undemocratic way in which he acted by giving all councils only two choices
... [Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member! Order! Hon members, you
are drowning out the speaker at the podium. Please give him an opportunity
to be heard.

Mnr W P DOMAN: Voorsitter, ek het nie probleme nie.  Hulle  moet  hulle  pak
vat. [Tussenwerpsels.]

... in plaas van drie, behoort in die hof getoets te word, want dit het  ook
die agt DA-beheerde rade in die uitvoerende  burgemeesterstelsel  ingedwing.
[Tussenwerpsels.]    Hulle   gaan   'n    voorbeeld    stel    deur    hulle
burgemeesterskomitees met oop deure te laat vergader, dokumentasie aan  alle
raadslede beskikbaar te stel, en om nie te  veel  mag  aan  een  persoon  te
delegeer nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Besef Minister Dowry en die Nuwe NP dat hierdie stap die belastingbetalers
van die Wes-Kaap R44 miljoen per jaar ekstra gaan kos. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek
het verlede jaar ook oor dieselfde saak met die rade geraadpleeg, maar
intussen het die agb Minister Mufamadi die reëls verander. Daardie reëls
kon gebruik geword het deur Minister Dowry om die uitvoerende
burgemeesterstelsel in te stel buite Kaapstad om twee of drie van die
grootste rade, soos Drakenstein en George, uitvoerende burgemeesters te gee
en 'n aantal voltydse raadslede aan te stel, maar hy het dit nie gedoen
nie. Wat 'n verkragting! [Tussenwerpsels.]

Agb Minister, u departement se toeligting vanjaar was van hoogstaande
gehalte, en die nuwe direkteur-generaal kan gelukgewens word met hoe sy
persoonlik verantwoordelikheid neem. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die nuwe strategiese
plan het 'n goeie inhoud, en dankie tog, dit is nie luuks gebind om te
mislei nie. Met die uitvoering daarvan gaan ons vir u help, maar ons gaan u
ook deeglik moniteer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Chairperson, I do not have problems. They must take their
hiding. [Interjections.]

... instead of three, should be tested in court, because it also forced the
eight DA-controlled councils into the executive mayor system.
[Interjections.] They are going to set an example by allowing their mayoral
committees to meet with open doors, making documentation available to all
councillors and not delegating too much power to one person.
[Interjections.]

Do Minister Dowry and the New NP realise that this step is going to cost
the taxpayers of the Western Cape an additional R44 million per annum.
[Interjections.] Last year I also consulted the councils about the same
issue, but in the meanwhile hon Minister Mufamadi has changed the rules.
Those rules could have been used by Minister Dowry to introduce the
executive mayor system outside Cape Town to give two or three of the
largest councils, such as Drakenstein and George, executive mayors and
appoint a number of full-time councillors, but he did not do that. What a
violation! [Interjections.]

Hon Minister, your department's information this year was of exceptional
quality, and the new director-general can be congratulated on the way that
she personally accepts responsibility. [Interjections.] The new strategic
plan has sound content and, thank heavens, it has not been luxuriously
bound to mislead. We are going to help you implement it, but we are also
going to monitor you thoroughly.]

PIMS centres are a waste of millions of rands. How can the department
expect a municipal manager and a staff to take much notice of two or three
people with little or no knowledge of local government to assist them with
their complicated administration? Rather spend the money on subsidising two
or three staff in the finance and personnel management at those
municipalities. Let the staff appoint them, but with your department's
specifications, to ensure real value is added.

Not only has the Seta delivered almost nothing, but municipalities are
totally confused about what they should expect from stakeholders. We
applaud the efforts of the portfolio committee to rectify the situation.
Your department should really now take the process forward.
[Interjections.]

Apart from its role as a central bargaining organisation, it seems that
councils will lose very little if Salga disappears. Minister, you should
now facilitate a process to redefine the purpose of Salga. [Interjections.]
One seriously questions whether the country's tax- and ratepayers get value
for the more than R120 million they spend on Salga, and whether there is
enough accountability within Salga to councils, to the public and to this
Parliament. [Interjections.] I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson, on a point of order: While Mr Doman was speaking,
the hon Johan Durand referred to him as "this man" when he wanted to ask
him a question. I think that is unparliamentary. Mr Doman is an hon member.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Lee, if you had listened
carefully, he corrected himself. [Interjections.]

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members and dignitaries who
have come here this afternoon keenly want to hear what the Minister is
offering to local government which comes face-to-face with poverty and the
people that need delivery.

Chairperson, service delivery is the main responsibility and the main
mandate of the local municipalities. Ultimately the test of the new system
of local government will be proved when these municipalities have matured
and have been given a chance. It is not correct that, in regard to the
municipalities that are in existence for three years, we are judgemental to
them and say that they don't work. Quite a number of the hon members were
with us when we had a tour to these municipalities. All of them said that
the situation was not what they thought it would be; the situation is
better than what we thought it would be. It was encouraging to come face to
face with realities.

The ANC-led Government is very aware that the institution that the hon
members are talking about, that of traditional leadership, occupies an
important place in South African society. Therefore we must address the
question of the institution of traditional leadership in a manner that
warrants dignity. I want to raise the issue today that some of the hon
members - the white traditional leadership of KwaZulu Natal - are giving me
the impression that the colonial rule which made use of the traditional
leadership is imminent because of how these people are speaking, glaringly
uninformed about how the ANC is dealing with the question of the
traditional leadership.

One thing that faced the ANC, when we were transforming this Government
from 1994, is the agenda of the movement and the agenda of this Government,
and how and what the role of traditional leadership is going to be in the
face of what has been happening throughout the world. These hon members
today said that it was 10 years, but we must bear in mind that we need to
handle the question of traditional leadership in a manner that we are not
going to regret tomorrow.

Now I would like to say that some of the hon members must get the
opportunity to go outside. We in the ANC cannot be proud of ourselves when
we have not taken responsibility to learn from other countries how they are
dealing with issues. One of the things that we have done is to take an
international trip to go and check how traditional leadership is handled. I
was with the chairperson of the house of traditional leaders while I was in
the province. We went to find out how traditional leadership is handled in
other countries.

The very same thing that happened in South Africa as a result of colonial
rule was the order of the day throughout the world. The traditional
leadership assumed a political power and became so powerful that they
oppressed the very same people under the cloak of being the traditional
leadership. We cannot take that road. We must take a road that says
traditional leadership occupies a unifying role for the people of this
country. They must not be the people that are deposing others and putting
traditional leadership forward.

When looking at the history of South Africa, we see that we had what we
call the independent self-governing territories. The people were appointed
by the apartheid government through the South African Act of 1909. This man
was so powerful that he could depose any other person - if one did not
smile, he could remove you and put in the traditional leadership who shared
his view, who he thought were the traditional leadership because he was
dancing to the tune of his master's voice. We are not going to do that. We
are going to deal with the question of traditional leadership in a manner
that will ensure that all of us have dignity in the role of the traditional
leadership.

The question of the White Paper on traditional leaders and the manner in
which the President opens the House of Traditional Leaders has clearly
indicated that the Government and the President are committed to making
traditional leadership work. One day, in spite of the challenges that are
there, those in the traditional leadership will not regret and say that it
was just a quick thing but that they had been given an opportunity to
ensure that it was real traditional leadership.

The spokesman for Nkosi Mzimela, the hon Mr Grobler, said that he wants to
ask him, but I think that he will not be proud of himself that today the DA
distorts some of the things that are aspired to by the ... [Interjections.]
Let me say to hon Grobler that when he came to this podium, he said that
Comrade Sydney Mufamadi had hired the crowd. I think it is an insult to the
people of this country because of the tradition of this House. During the
white rule that hon Grobler was a part of, blacks were not allowed to enter
this House. [Applause.]

Today black people are here. He says that they are hired. It is an insult
because these men, women and comrades that are here bestow dignity and want
to find out how they are going to be part of the army that shapes local
government in a manner that all of us would be proud of. I do not think
that was a correct statement made by the hon member. [Applause.]

Regarding Mrs Seaton, for the first time in the KwaZulu Natal we have a
white woman in the traditional leadership, who speaks in a wrong way, in
any event. Kodwa ukube namhlanje bewuphathwe njengeNkosi yakwaZulu-Natali
[But if you have been treated as the King of KwaZulu Natal today], then you
are busy aiming the people this negative idea because those are the lessons
that have cast aspersions on the leadership and say that they are
downplaying its importance, and yet you want to make the traditional
leadership what you want it to be. [Interjections.] It is very wrong.

The DA speaks about the money that is wasted by the Minister on the
municipalities but I can tell the House that the DA aspired to federalism
and wanted to decentralise everything. Hon member Doman, when he was a
Minister in the Western Cape, was knocking on the Minister's office door
every day, asking whether the Minister could give him money because the
municipalities were ailing. Today, the Minister is giving money, and the
hon member says that it is a waste of resources because he is not there any
longer.

Mrs Southgate talked about ... [Time expired.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson, allow me to
thank all the hon members who took part in this debate. As always, quite a
number of hon members made suggestions which should be taken into account
going forward.

The hon Mr Grobler is very fortunate because, unlike the hon Mr Komphela, I
am not in a fighting mood. He took the podium and, amongst other things,
decried the fact that the proportion of the budget of municipalities which
goes on salaries is too high and he said that he doubted whether the
approach of municipalities to their budgets was scientific. I must also say
that I doubt the scientific nature of his own approach. [Laughter.] He
ought to have known that the municipal services which are being rendered
today, given the scope of coverage, are themselves labour-intensive. But
quite apart from that, perhaps he must do a little bit of comparative
analysis because, indeed, 32% of municipal budgets, on national average, go
on salaries. However, he will find that in the case of London and New York,
54% and 60% respectively go on salaries. So, I don't know what
international benchmarking he relied on.

I have listened to the hon Mrs Seaton who has chosen to become the honorary
spokesperson of the Coalition of Traditional Leaders. She subjected the
House to a chronicle of quotations and a litany of complaints about what
Government has done as well as what Government has not done. Purporting to
be speaking on behalf of the Coalition of Traditional Leaders, she actually
defiled the atmosphere within which the process of consultation towards the
White Paper is taking place. The only warning I want to issue to her is
that she must never do that.

The other hon member who deemed it necessary to say something about what
she called the complex issue of traditional leadership was Mrs Southgate.
Unfortunately, she tried to debate what she called the complex issue within
the constraints of the two minutes which the smallness of her party
entitles her to. Therefore she was not able to come to some of the
reasonable conclusions that she would possibly have come to. She boldly
asserted that the Ministry has done nothing to improve relations between
traditional leaders and elected councillors at local level. Perhaps when
the hon Nefolovhodwe next goes to Kaminga and Dzanani, she must try to go
along with him because she will then understand that the situation is
different from what she imagines it to be. Of course, we read different
Bibles - she and I. My Bible tells me that I must always tell the truth.
[Laughter.] My advice to her is that when she is not sure of the facts she
must not take chances.
The hon Mr Aucamp, a very good member of Parliament, indeed, said his say
and left in a hurry to go and do constituency work in Pretoria. But before
taking leave of the House, he advised me to ask the President to appoint to
the section 185 commission only those Afrikaners that he chooses. He has a
good story to tell his constituency, namely that that is a request that he
made. However, I cannot guarantee that his request will be considered
favourably. [Laughter.]

What I do want to say, however, is that an appreciable level of interest
has been shown by people who want to serve on this section 185 commission.
The President has to appoint a minimum of 12 people to serve on the
commission and a maximum of 17. So far we have received 180 applications
from people who want to serve on the commission. We are in the process of
appointing a selection panel to assist us to arrive at a conclusion as to
who the appropriate people are that should serve on the commission.

The hon Mr Doman, the former MEC for local government in the Western Cape,
made a number of proposals. He made an offer which I gladly accept which is
that he will help us implement the good decisions that were taken by both
this House and the Ministry. As I say, I accept the offer but before he
came to the offer he spent a disproportionately high amount of time
complaining about the fact that Mr Dowry took over from him. That did not
give him enough time to make enough offers. [Laughter.]

Having said that, hon members, you are all invited to a cocktail party
which we are going to have at the end of this debate. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.
