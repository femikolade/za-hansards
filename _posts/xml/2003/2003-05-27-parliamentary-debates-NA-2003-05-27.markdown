                                 AFRICA DAY

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr M RAMGOBIN (ANC): Chairperson, in the days  of  liberation  politics  our
country,  South  Africa,  reverberated  with  our  calls  of  ``Mayibuye  i-
Afrika!''  and  refused  to  remain  tied  to  the  yoke   of   colonialism,
imperialism and apartheid. Our gift to our  continent  of  the  hymn,  Nkosi
Sikelel' i-Afrika, was yet another.

The total emancipation of Africa was a commitment made by  the  fathers  and
mothers of the OAU. We are emancipated, and even though  our  unity  remains
somewhat marred by colonial boundaries, we  recognise  our  shared  destiny.
The ANC is committed to engaging in  activities  that  will  take  the  2003
celebrations into the programmes and projects of Nepad to give firm  meaning
to Africa's liberation. Nepad is our continental programme and the AU  is  a
vehicle.  We  have  to  ensure  that  the  entire  continent  enjoys  peace,
stability, development and democracy.

The  celebrations  mean  that  we  have  to  be  forever  vigilant   against
destabilisation,  aggression  and  undemocratic  practices.   Equally,   the
celebrations also mean that poverty in the  midst  of  plenty  will  not  be
allowed to persist  and  that,  on  the  basis  of  human  rights,  we  also
celebrate the AU's charter on human rights which is a  worthy  gift  to  our
continent's children and their children.

For the ANC, the celebrations  are  an  integral  part  of  the  continental
movement of solidarity, stating to the world that Africa has  the  will  and
commitment to solve the problems as Africans with  the  pre-eminent  choices
of pushing back the frontiers of poverty and creating conditions for  peace,
security and stability.

The ANC calls on all political parties to begin to be  engaged.  This  is  a
call to action to make that possible so that all of us, as  Africans,  share
the burden of responsibility for our continent. [Applause.]

                        GENERAL AMNESTY FOR PRISONERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M J ELLIS (DA): Mr Chairman, the DA is opposed to a  general  amnesty  or
mass presidential pardon for prisoners as a means  of  clearing  overcrowded
prisons, especially regarding those  who  are  in  prison  for  serious  and
violent crimes. It sends a wrong message, both to  the  general  public  who
look to the state to protect them from crime and to the criminals  for  whom
a prison sentence is supposed to be a deterrent.

Judge Fagan is correct in saying that South  Africa's  jails  are  seriously
overcrowded, which results in  completely  inhumane  conditions.  They  were
built  to  accommodate  approximately  120  000  prisoners.  They  presently
accommodate over 187 000, of which 57 000 are awaiting-trial prisoners.

The solution lies not in general amnesty, but in  proper  implementation  of
available remedies through the courts. The main problem is  unsentenced  and
awaiting-trial prisoners. Many prisoners are in jail  unnecessarily  because
they cannot pay any amounts of bail in relation  to  minor  charges  against
them.
There are at present two important avenues under the  law  to  release  them
from jail or to prevent them from being jailed. The problem  is  that  these
are not being utilised. The first is a mass release of minor  offenders  who
can't pay bail under section  65(a)  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act.  The
second is the use of  pretrial  services  which  utilise  the  community  to
ensure that minor offenders turn  up  in  court  for  their  trials  without
paying bail.

Judge Fagan confirmed that if these  two  available  methods  were  utilised
properly, we could release 20  000  prisoners  within  a  matter  of  weeks.
Rather than supporting a general  amnesty,  the  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, Penuell Maduna, should ensure that  these  tools
are applied within the courts. He should also  provide  the  leadership  and
resources required to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness  with  which
criminal cases are processed through the courts.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your statement was slightly  over
the time limit, and I will reiterate the call from other presiding  officers
that your statements should be within the given time.

                    PROTECTION OF CHILDREN AGAINST ABUSE

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz  M  XULU  (IFP):  Sihlalo,  kuleli  viki  esikulo  sigubha  ukuvikeleka
kwezingane kuyo yonke inhlobo yokuhlukunyezwa.  Okubuhlungu  kakhulu  ukuthi
nakuba sigubha leli Viki lokuVikeleka kweziNgane  izigameko  zokuhlukunyezwa
kwazo  zilokhu  ziqhubeka  emphakathini  esiphila  kuwo.  Thina  njengabantu
besifazane  kusizwisa  ubuhlungu  ukuqhubeka   kwezigameko   zokuhlukunyezwa
kwezingane.

Kukhona  isehlo  esenzeke  ngempelasonto  endaweni  yakwaMhlongo,  eMandeni,
lapho sizwa kuthiwa umlisa mumbe uthe uma efica izingane  sezichithe  upende
wakhe   wazikhokhisa   ngokuziphoqa   ukuthi   zizipende   ubuso   nomzimba.
Okubuhlungu  kakhulu  ukuthi  lezi  zingane  okudlalwa  ngazo  zizintandane,
azinabazali bokuzilwela.

Lesi senzo salo mlisa asikhombisi ukuthi unomqondo ophilayo, kwazise  ukuthi
lo  muntu  kade  enguthisha  wendawo   ngaphambilini.   Kuyamangaza   ukuthi
bushonephi ubuntu kuye nokuthi,  njengothisha,  akazami  ngani  ukuthi  lezi
zingane zisizakale ngokuya esikoleni? Esikhundleni salokho, uzenza  izigqila
zakhe zokwelusa izinkomo nezimbuzi. Bekungakuhle lo mlisa  athole  isijeziso
esizoba yisifundo ezweni lonke ukuze kuthi nobesacabanga  ukudlala  ngengane
azi kahle kamhlophe ukuthi akudlalelwa  enganeni  ngoba  ingenabazali  futhi
ingenawo amandla okuziphindisela.  Ngiyabonga.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of
Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Miss  M  XULU  (IFP):  Chairperson,  this  week  we  are  celebrating   the
protection of children against all kinds of abuse. It  is  heartbreaking  to
realise that even though we are celebrating Children's  Week,  incidents  of
child abuse are still continuing in our communities.  This  continuation  of
child abuse hurts us as women.

An event took place over the weekend at Mandeni in the Mhlongo  area,  where
a certain man, having found that children had spilt  his  paint,  made  them
paint their faces and bodies as a way of repaying him.  What  is  bad  about
this situation is that these children were orphans, and they  did  not  have
parents to protect them.

This man's actions characterise an imbalanced mental  condition,  especially
because he had been a teacher in this area in previous  years.  This  brings
up so many questions about his humanity, and the fact  that  he  is  an  ex-
teacher means that he should find some means of getting these children  some
help so that they can go to  school.  Instead  of  helping  them,  he  makes
slaves of them, to look after his cattle and  goats.  It  would  be  a  good
thing if this man were to  receive  severe  punishment,  which  would  be  a
lesson to the whole country so that even those who were  still  planning  to
abuse children should know that no one should abuse a child  because  he  or
she doesn't have parents or the power to fight for him  or  herself  against
the abuser. Thank you. [Applause.]]
The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  can  I  have  your
attention please. Can  all  members  be  seated.  We  are  using  the  floor
microphones and members are walking up and down in front of the  member  who
is speaking into the microphone - between the microphone and  the  Chair.  I
must ask you all to be seated.

Can we ask the service officers to refrain from handing out  those  booklets
until after the members' statements session.

                        INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S DAY

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms L M T XINGWANA (ANC): Chairperson, the period from 27 May to 2 June  2003
is Child Protection Week. The Government and civil society as a  whole  will
use this week to highlight issues related to  upholding  and  defending  the
rights  of  children.  The  international  community  will  also   celebrate
International Children's Day on 1 June.

Critical to reaffirming the rights of children is the need to highlight  the
plight of the thousands of children who are  in  armed  conflict  situations
and those trapped in poverty. Society has an obligation to build a  brighter
future for all children. The ANC Government has  made  strides  in  ensuring
that children from all  walks  of  life  have  opportunities  for  a  better
tomorrow.  The  Government  has  ensured  that  our  education   system   is
transformed to equip the nation's children with the necessary  life  skills.
Health services are provided for free to women and  to  children  under  the
age of six years. The Government has announced that the child grant will  be
progressively extended to children up to 14 years of  age.  These  are  just
some of the  fruits  of  the  first  decade  of  freedom  for  the  nation's
children.

Whilst  the  Government  has  made  these  strides,  the  nation  is   still
confronted with barbaric acts of child abuse. The nation of South Africa  is
confronted with the huge challenge of creating a caring environment for  all
children.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order!  Hon  member,  your  time  has
expired.

Ms L M T XINGWANA (ANC): We must highlight the value of the saying,  ``Every
child  is  my  child''  and  make  child  protection  everybody's  business.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, you went well over your  time.  I
tried to indicate to you that your time had expired.

                    ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (Nuwe NP): Mnr die Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP neem kennis  dat  die
Wes-Kaap sy stryd teen pediatriese  vigs  verskerp  het  en  weer  eens  die
voortou geneem het in die stryd teen MIV/Vigs. Gister  is  bekendgemaak  dat
swanger ma's wat MIV-positief is, nou  'n  bykomende  dosis  antiretrovirale
middels sal kry. Dit sal daartoe lei dat slegs  'n  baie  klein  persentasie
kinders in die toekoms met die MI-virus gebore sal word.

Die Nuwe NP verwelkom hierdie stap, want nie alleen  stel  die  Wes-Kaap  'n
voorbeeld van hoe MIV/Vigs effektief aangespreek kan word nie, maar  hierdie
nuwe dosis antiretrovirale middels sal ook daartoe lei dat die  Wes-Kaap  sy
mikpunt om pediatriese vigs geheel en al uit te roei gouer sal  bereik.  Die
Nuwe NP  het  nog  altyd  die  standpunt  gehandhaaf  dat  die  gebruik  van
antiretrovirale middels nie genoeg beklemtoon kan word nie en  dat  dit  een
van die voorvereistes is om Vigs effektief aan te spreek.

Antiretrovirale middels kan nie net die oordrag van Vigs verhoed  nie,  maar
kan ook vir mense wat reeds positief is  'n  beter  lewenstandaard  beteken.
Dit word alreeds suksesvol in die private  sektor  gebruik.  Die  effektiewe
gebruik van die middels in die openbare  sektor  kan  nie  langer  uitgestel
word nie. Die leidende rol wat die Wes-Kaapse regering  in  hierdie  verband
geneem het en deurgaans sal speel,  sal  hopelik  die  weg  baan  vir  ander
provinsies. Dankie. [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's
statement follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS (New NP): Mr Chairperson,  the  New  NP  takes  note  that  the
Western Cape has intensified its campaign against pediatric Aids,  and  once
again took the lead in the  campaign  against  HIV/Aids.  Yesterday  it  was
announced that pregnant mothers who are HIV positive  will  now  receive  an
additional dosage of antiretrovirals. This will lead to only  a  very  small
percentage of children who will in future be born with the HI-virus.

The New NP welcomes this step, because not only is the Western Cape  setting
an example of how HIV/Aids  can  effectively  be  addressed,  but  this  new
dosage of antiretrovirals will also lead to the Western  Cape  reaching  its
goal to eradicate  pediatric  aids  much  sooner.  The  New  NP  has  always
maintained the point of view that  the  use  of  antiretrovirals  cannot  be
emphasised enough and that it is one of  the  prerequisites  to  effectively
address Aids.

Antiretrovirals not only prevent the transmission  of  Aids,  but  can  also
mean a better living standard to people who have  already  tested  positive.
This  is  already  being  used  successfully  in  the  private  sector.  The
effective use of the medication in  the  public  sector  can  no  longer  be
postponed. The leading role that the Western Cape government  is  taking  in
this regard and will continue to play,  will  hopefully  pave  the  way  for
other provinces. Thank you. [Interjections.]]

                          SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN

                            (Member's Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Chairperson, the ACDP would like to  wholeheartedly
support the cry of desperation from the  organisation  Women  Against  Child
Abuse, for Government to stop shifting the blame for  the  levels  of  child
abuse in South Africa, and change  the  legislation  it  created  when  this
Parliament legalised pornography which contributes to the problem.

The SA National Council for Child Welfare says that it handles about 26  000
cases of sexual and physical abuse of children countrywide every month.  The
blame for the recent increase in child abuse and child  rapes  needs  to  be
laid firmly  at  the  feet  of  Government  who,  through  its  liberal  and
antifamily laws, and lenient sentences that are imposed  on  criminals,  has
created a climate conducive to the spread of the unacceptable  behaviour  of
sexually abusing children who should be celebrating their innocence.

Crimes against children are taking on epic proportions, and  the  Government
should at least ensure  that  a  minimum  life  sentence  is  mandatory  and
imposed in all cases of child rape, as  criminals  found  guilty  of  crimes
against children often get off with nothing more than a slap  on  the  wrist
from the courts in our country.

The legislation on pornography has contributed  to  the  problem.  The  ACDP
wants to reiterate that Parliament made a mistake by legalising  pornography
which inflames the passion and lust of men and causes them  to  go  out  and
commit despicable acts of rape and violence  against  defenceless  children.
For as long as we have so much pornography in this  country,  the  incidence
of rape of children will keep on increasing. Pornography is the theory,  but
rape is the practice.

                      CONSERVATION OF MALI MANUSCRIPTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I VADI (ANC): Chairperson, on  Sunday  President  Thabo  Mbeki  and  Mali
President, Amadou  Touré,  launched  a  presidential  project  of  the  Mali
manuscripts during the Africa Day celebrations. These manuscripts from  14th
century  Mali  provide  early  scientific  study  around   weather,   crops,
geography and mathematics. These documents bear testimony to the  fact  that
Africa contributed immensely  to  the  development  of  world  civilisation.
These manuscripts are an important heritage of the African  people  as  they
work for unity, peace, prosperity and the revival of the African continent.
The ANC commends Presidents Mbeki and Amadou Touré for launching  a  project
for  the  conservation  of  these  manuscripts.  We   believe   that   these
manuscripts will give this generation and future generations better  insight
into  and  understanding  of  early  civilisations   in   Africa   and   its
contribution to the broader civilisation of the world. Thank you very  much.
[Applause.]

                             SECURITY IN SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms  N  C  NKABINDE  (UDM):  Chairperson,  the  UDM  extends  its   sincerest
condolences to the families of schoolchildren  who  died  in  the  spate  of
shooting incidents in the past fortnight.

The UDM calls on both the Minister of Education and Minister of  Safety  and
Security to immediately address the issue of security  in  schools  so  that
shootings among  pupils  are  prevented.  The  unfortunate  and  unnecessary
deaths of these four pupils are a stark reminder of the extent to which  the
culture of violence in society has spread to our  schools.  Parents  rightly
expect that schools should be places of  safety  for  their  children  where
attendance is compulsory.

These incidents are an indictment of the Government which dragged  its  feet
with the implementation of the Firearms Control Act. What  happened  to  the
intention of ensuring that schools would be gun-free zones? The  UDM  is  of
the view that regular surprise police inspections for  drugs  and  dangerous
weapons in schools  will  help  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  violence  at
schools. It will also encourage the silent majority  to  speak  out  against
the hooligans instead of some of them  themselves  turning  to  violence  in
retaliation.

                          HEALTH MEC IN MPUMALANGA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C AUCAMP (NA): Voorsitter, die  Uitvoerende  Raad  van  die  Mpumalanga-
wetgewer onder leiding van mnr Mahlangu het alle besluitnemingsmagte van  me
Sibongile Manana, omstrede LUR belas met gesondheid,  en  me  Rina  Charles,
haar departementshoof, weggeneem.

'n Verdoemende verslag deur die Ouditeur-generaal wat reeds in Oktober  2001
voltooi is, wys ernstige wanbestuur in die  Tonga-  en  Shonwe-hospitale  in
Mpumalanga uit. Minstens twee babas is luidens  dié  verslag  onnodig  dood.
Haar ondeurdagte en onwettige optrede teen dr Thys van  Mollendorf  is  vars
in  die  geheue,  terwyl  volgehoue  klagtes  van  gemeenskappe  regoor  die
provinsie ingestroom het.

Hoewel 'n mens die optrede teen Manana verwelkom, is dit te  min,  te  laat.
Die vraag wat die NA vra, is dit: is besluitneming nie  die  wesenlike  kern
van 'n LUR se pos nie? Wat is 'n Minister of 'n LUR  wat  nie  besluite  mag
neem nie? Dis soos 'n dominee wat nie mag preek nie -  'n  belastingbetaalde
luukse-in-opleiding.  Ons  Minister  van   Gesondheid   het   onlangs   haar
ongekwalifiseerde steun aan Manana toegesê met die stelling  dat  sy  bereid
is om saam met haar tronk toe te gaan.

Die NA wil graag van die Minister weet of dit steeds haar  standpunt  is  en
of sy enige rol daarin gespeel het dat Manana nie vervang  is  nie.  Die  NA
wil van die ANC verneem of hierdie reuseparty oor  niemand  beskik  wat  wel
politieke verantwoordelikheid vir gesondheid in Mpumalanga kan aanvaar  nie.
Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Chairperson, the  Executive  Council  of  the  Mpumalanga
Legislature under the leadership of Mr Mahlangu has taken away all decision-
making powers from Ms Sibongile Manana, the controversial MEC  charged  with
health, and Ms Rina Charles, her head of department.

A damning report by the Auditor-General, which had  already  been  completed
in October 2001 reveals  serious  mismanagement  in  the  Tonga  and  Shonwe
Hospitals in Mpumalanga. According to this report at least two  babies  died
unnecessarily. Her ill-considered and illegal action  against  Dr  Thys  von
Molendorf  is  fresh  in  our  memory,  while  continuous  complaints   from
communities throughout the province come pouring in.

Although one welcomes the action against  Manana,  it  is  too  little,  too
late. The question posed by the NA  is  this:  Is  decision-making  not  the
essential aspect of an MEC's function? Of what use is a Minister or  an  MEC
who may not make decisions? This is comparable  to  a  parson  who  may  not
preach - a luxury-in-training paid for by  the  taxpayer.  Our  Minister  of
Health recently expressed  her  unqualified  support  for  Manana  with  the
statement that she was willing to go to jail with her.

The NA would like to know from  the  Minister  whether  this  is  still  her
standpoint and whether she played any role in the fact that Manana  has  not
been replaced. The NA would like to ask the ANC whether there is no  one  in
this huge party who could, in  fact,  accept  political  responsibility  for
health in Mpumalanga. I thank you.]

                   SIBUSISO VILANE CONQUERS MOUNT EVEREST

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs B M NTULI (ANC): Comrade  Chair,  Sibusiso  Vilane  of  Mpumalanga  made
history by becoming the first black South  African  person  to  climb  Mount
Everest. Vilane's first mountain-climbing experience was last year  when  he
successfully climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Vilane is  reported  to  have  cried
while rejoicing in the realisation of his dream  by  reaching  the  peak  of
Mount Everest.

The ANC congratulates Sibusiso for successfully climbing Mount Everest.  His
success epitomises the uphill battle that the people of  South  Africa  from
all walks of life had to wage to defeat the Draconian system  of  apartheid,
and build national unity and a nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic  South
Africa.

He serves as an inspiration to all young  people  in  our  country  to  work
selflessly in order to realise the noble  dreams  that  inspired  us  as  we
fought for the freedom of all people in our country.

We hope  that  thousands  more  Sibusisos  will  flourish  and  tackle  with
diligence  and  determination  all  obstacles  that  we  experience  in  our
struggle to push back the frontiers of poverty  and  underdevelopment.  Once
again, the ANC congratulates Sibusiso and wishes him success in  his  future
endeavours. I thank you. [Applause.]

                            CHILD SUPPORT GRANTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs G M BORMAN (DA):  Chairperson,  the  DA  is  deeply  concerned  that  11
million children in South Africa live in poverty. A study by the  Children's
Institute at UCT based this  finding  on  a  poverty  measure  of  R245  per
monthly  household  income.  They  said  that  while  the   Government   has
implemented different poverty alleviating mechanisms,  these  efforts  still
fall  short  of  meeting  children's  basic  needs   and   promoting   their
socioeconomic rights. They further stated that there is an  urgent  need  to
re-examine the Government's poverty alleviating interventions.
In October 2002 only 42% of children younger than eight years  of  age,  who
have the right to assistance through social  grants,  were  benefiting  from
the child support grant. A lack of staff, officers and other resources  made
it difficult to register seven and eight-year-old children.

The DA believes that implementing a basic income grant  of  R110  per  month
will go a long way towards alleviating the  plight  of  those  children  who
live in dire poverty. However, even more important is the creation  of  jobs
for some 7 million people who are  currently  out  of  work.  I  thank  you.

                     DISCORDANT COUPLES AND HIV RESEARCH

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr  R  RABINOWITZ  (IFP):  Chairperson,  recent  research  at   Chris   Hani
Baragwanath Hospital has demonstrated the existence of so-called  discordant
couples - individuals in whom the HIV infection  of  one  partner  does  not
result in the second partner contracting HIV or Aids. A  similar  phenomenon
was discovered in regard to sex workers.

Theories to  explain  this  phenomenon  abound.  Some  relate  to  increased
immunity  and  some  relate  to  genetic  markers  called  human   leukocyte
antigens. These are proteins that play  a  role  in  activating  the  body's
immunity. A third theory suggests  that  the  resistance  is  related  to  a
specific co-receptor CD4 or Helper T cell. These cells  normally  contribute
to a person's immunity. When attacked by HIV, they begin  to  reproduce  the
virus. However, in discordant  couples,  there  may  be  difference  in  co-
receptor or Helper T cells, in particular those known as CCR5.

Though rare, the importance of these findings should not be  underestimated,
particularly by the research and academic community who fear that  knowledge
of this immunity will cause people to  underestimate  the  danger  of  being
infected with HIV. We would therefore like to  encourage  Sanac,  Government
Ministers  and  academic  institutions  to  thoroughly   investigate   these
phenomena, rare though they are, in order to  drive  Aids  research  into  a
different direction from antiretrovirals and vaccine research.

While we endorse  current  research,  we  feel  that  all  avenues  must  be
explored, including the understanding  of  natural  immunity  of  discordant
couples and investigating ways to boost  immunity  through  diet,  vitamins,
homeopathy, traditional medicines and other reasonable mechanisms that  have
produced prima facie evidence of efficacy. [Time expired.] Thank you.

                           HOUSING IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr D A A OLIFANT (ANC): Agb Voorsitter, graag wil ons die Wes-Kaap  se  LUR
vir Behuising, Me Hangana, asook die burgemeester  van  Kaapstad,  Nomaindia
Mfeketo, gelukwens met die oorhandiging van 1 443 huise binne  een  week  in
Franschoek  en  Atlantis.  Ons  neem  verder  kennis  dat  die  laaste  nuwe
behuising in Franschoek 31 jaar gelede gelewer is  en  dat  die  vorige  DA-
regering eenvoudig net nie belang gestel het in  die  behuisingsontwikkeling
van swartmense in dié gebied nie. Die ANC-NNP-regering het  nou  daadwerklik
begin om die behuisingsprobleem in die Wes-Kaap op te los  en  terselfdertyd
'n integrasieproses begin.

Tydens  die  DA-bewind  in  Atlantis   was   daar   eenvoudig   voortdurende
vertragings en ook bankrotskap wat gelei het  tot  die  likwidasie  van  die
Blouberg-behuisingsassosiasie. As gevolg van wanbestuur  kon  hierdie  huise
nie betyds gelewer word nie, en die huise wat wel gebou is, was van 'n  baie
swak gehalte en met baie gebreke. Weer  eens  moes  die  ANC-NNP-vennootskap
intree en die likwidasieproses tersyde stel om huise betyds te kon lewer.

Laastens is dit duidelik dat ons ernstig is  met  die  verbetering  van  ons
mense se lewenstandaard en nie besig is met goedkoop politiek soos  die  DA,
wat  Vrydag  tydens  die  oorhandiging  van  die  huise   in   Atlantis   'n
georkestreerde protes gehou het en wat  natuurlik  gefaal  het;  om  so  die
aandag af te trek van die  goeie  werk  wat  in  die  provinsie  en  in  die
Kaapstadse Munisipaliteit gedoen word. [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr D A A OLIFANT (ANC): Hon Mr Chairperson, we would like  to  congratulate
the MEC of Housing for the Western Cape, Ms Hangana and the  Mayor  of  Cape
Town, Nomaindia Mfeketo on handing over  1  443  houses  in  Franschoek  and
Atlantis within in one week.  Furthermore,  take  note  that  the  last  new
housing was delivered in Franschoek 31 years ago and that  the  previous  DA
administration was simply not interested in the development of  housing  for
blacks in this area. The ANC-NNP administration has now  actively  begun  to
resolve  the  housing  problem  in  the  Western  Cape  and   initiated   an
integration process at the same time.

In Atlantis, under DA rule, there were simply  too  many  continuous  delays
and insolvencies in Atlantis under the DA administration, which  contributed
to the liquidation of the Blouberg  Housing  Association.  As  a  result  of
mismanagement these houses could not be delivered on time and  besides,  the
houses that were in fact built were of a poor quality and had many  defects.
Once again the ANC-NNP partnership  had  to  intervene  and  set  aside  the
liquidation process in order to deliver houses on time.

Lastly, it is clear that we are serious about  improving  the  standards  of
living of our people and that we are not busy with cheap politics  like  the
DA,  who,  during  the  handing-over  in  Atlantis  on   Friday,   held   an
orchestrated protest that naturally failed; thereby  trying  to  divert  the
attention from the  good  work  being  done  in  the  province  and  in  the
Municipality of Cape Town. [Applause.]]

                          YOUNG MPs LEAVING THE DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Chairperson, it must have been  a  sad  day
for the DA when their three young bright  sparks,  Raenette  Taljaard,  Nick
Clelland-Stokes and Riaan Coetzee, in whom they invested so  much,  deserted
the DA in such a short space of time. This does not come as a surprise.  All
three of them - unflinchingly rebelling against all tradition, and  equipped
with  youthful  and  sometimes  irrational  passion  -  joined  the  DP  and
obviously felt at home lobbying elitist  liberal  principles.  Coetzee,  the
main fight-back strategist; Clelland-Stokes, the  presentable  face  of  the
party, and Taljaard, the superintellectual, threw in the towel and  are  now
pursuing new career opportunities.

Is it possible that there is truth in the  saying  that  wisdom  comes  with
age, or have they just had enough of their leaders'  arrogance?  Maybe  they
have realised that today's DA is on the road to  nowhere.  Can  it  be  true
that they just can't bring themselves to  fight  the  struggle  alongside  a
bunch of conservative right-wing  veterans,  and  that  they  simply  cannot
justify themselves in their youthful circles anymore? [Interjections.]

Maybe, in future, the DA will think twice before accepting just anyone  into
their party. The question remains: Which of the other disillusioned  members
of the brat pack will follow suit in their effort to get out? I  thank  you.
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

                             SECURITY IN SCHOOLS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Hon Chairperson, the  hon  member  from  the  UDM
raised the issue of guns in schools. I don't think it's proper to  say  that
the Government is responsible for that. Our policy is very clear and  it  is
being enforced in schools.

The first thing that we did, from 1999, was to fence the  schools.  Many  of
our schools were not fenced at all. In fact, the vast  majority  of  schools
which I have visited in the past four or five months are  now  fenced.  That
is the first step. The second  step  is  that  you  can't  prohibit  access.
Schools are not prisons. We don't want them to be similar to the inner  city
schools of the United  States  where  there  are  armed  guards  who  patrol
schools.
The  important  thing  that  the  UDM  must  realise  is  that  there  is  a
proliferation of guns in our country. We declared schools  to  be  gun-free,
drug-free and free of dangerous implements nearly 18 months ago.  We  didn't
wait for the legislation. But the fact that you have  passed  the  law  does
not mean that things will happen. We have  severe  penalties  being  imposed
regarding motor car accidents. However, transgressions of the  Road  Traffic
Act still  take  place.  I  think  that  it  is  the  community  sense  that
tolerates, for example, a policeman allowing his son not  to  steal  but  to
take a gun into school. It's the sense  that  we  have  no  idea  about  the
lethal nature of guns and the proliferation of guns. So, I ask the House  to
join us in  trying  to  ensure  greater  consciousness  about  guns  in  our
society.

By the way, I should say that South African schools are relatively  free  of
the kind of violence that takes place  not  only  in  inner  cities  but  in
suburbia  in  other  parts  of  the  world  and  in  the  United  States  in
particular. However, I am not satisfied. If 20 children have died - which  I
understand is the figure for the past two years - then that is 20  kids  too
many who have died. We must raise the consciousness of  our  society,  which
unfortunately shows tendencies towards  violence,  that  this  will  not  be
tolerated. We must be united in action, not only in schools  but  everywhere
in our society, to say that there is no hiding place for those who use  guns
and dangerous implements. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                        GENERAL AMNESTY FOR PRISONERS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, obviously,  Judge  Fagan
who is also the inspecting judge of prisons is concerned about the state  of
overpopulation in our prison system and, I think, rightly so.

However, what Judge Fagan mentioned is not an  entirely  new  practice.  The
issue of pardon or amnesty is an internationally accepted practice which  is
also attached to the powers and prerogatives of presidents. Some nations  do
it to deal  with  the  questions  of  economic  plight,  particularly  where
prisons drain the economy and therefore those nations could  not  deal  with
priorities. Some nations also do it simply to mark a  particular  event  and
day in their history and others do it on a humanitarian basis. So it is  not
an entirely new practice.

The hon member is  correct  in  saying  that  we  do  have  some  legal  and
constitutional provisions which we can  aggressively  pursue  to  make  sure
that we deal with this question of overcrowding. I think  that  the  cluster
of peace and security Ministers is also seized with that  matter.  It  comes
up again and again in most meetings. We are dealing with that question,  but
it is a very difficult matter to resolve as speedily as  people  would  like
us to.

                          SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  I
heard the hon Rev Meshoe saying people who indulge in all sorts of  offences
against children get off with light sentences. One would hope that  the  hon
member bases that sort of assertion on a careful  study  of  statistics  and
data in this regard, because if the hon member is merely making a  statement
it would, indeed, be a misleading statement which one would not expect  from
a member of this House. As members of this House,  whether  we  like  it  or
not, we are in a leadership position. So, the public  out  there  is  always
entitled to assume that whatever utterances we make have a basis in fact.

Prisons have many people right now who  are  serving  life  sentences  as  a
result of such offences. In one part of the country where I  was  yesterday,
Thohoyandou, just in that region, the courts imposed 20 life sentences  from
the middle of last year towards  the  beginning  of  this  year  -  20  life
sentences, and appropriately so.

I don't know whether life sentences are sentences that can, by  any  stretch
of the imagination, be described as light sentences. There is nothing  light
about a life sentence, hon member. Thanks. [Applause.]

  AFRICA DAY: FROM 40 YEARS OF SOLIDARITY IN STRUGGLE TO A CENTURY OF UNITY
                                  AND PEACE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr G C OOSTHUIZEN: Afrika ke nako!  Modulasetulo,  nako  ya  Afrika  etlile.
[Africa, the time has come! Chairperson, the time for Africa has come.]

Voorsitter, die visie van 'n Afrika-renaissance  het  aanleiding  gegee  tot
die stigting van die Afrika Unie  in  sy  huidige  vorm,  Nepad  en  al  die
gepaardgaande strukture. Vandag kan ons terugkyk en sê: dit  was  met  trots
dat ons Sondag gesien en  beleef  het  hoe  Afrika  opgestaan  het  en  self
instaan om haar uitdagings die hoof te bied.

Die stigting van die AU, die daarstel van  Nepad  en  die  geboorte  daarvan
kan,  soos  die  hele  begrip   van   die   Afrika-renaissance,   met   twee
vergrootglase ondersoek word. Die een soeklig sal sekerlik met  agterdog  na
die nuwe vorm van swartgevaar soek en indien dit nie  ooglopend  sigbaar  is
nie, sal daardie soeklig val oor waar dit  verskans  mag  wees.  Die  ander,
regte en positiewe soeklig sal val op  die  geleenthede  wat  aangegryp  kan
word om van Afrika 'n wen-kontinent te maak.

Ek en baie ander skaar ons heelhartig by  die  geleenthede  wat  die  AU  en
Nepad ons as Afrikane bied,  om  vanuit  bepaalde  beginsels  die  sake  van
Afrika  te  bestuur  -  Afrika  beginsels  en   internasionaal   aanvaarbare
beginsels; demokratiese, ekonomiese en sosiale beginsels.

Breedweg het Afrika, veral in  die  suide,  sedert  die  1800s  basies  drie
politieke modelle gehad. Nie een het gewerk nie. Ons is dankbaar dat die  AU
nie daarteen vaskyk en so perspektief op die toekoms verloor nie.

Vanaf 1840 tot 1960 was die tydperk waar die model van kolonialisme aan  die
orde van die dag  was.  In  die  koloniale  tyd  was  matige  infrastruktuur
ontwikkel, maar nodeloos om te sê, van die kolonialisme  het  eerder  geneig
tot die opleiding van slawe en onderdane,  eerder  as  die  ontwikkeling  en
opleiding van Afrika leierskap. Trouens, ons  in  Suid-Afrika  het  dit  nie
vrygespring nie, want apartheid was op die ou einde van die dag mos net  die
nierstene van kolonialisme. Waar kolonialisme  uitsluitlik  die  belang  van
die koloniale moondheid gedien het, het  apartheid  uitsluitlik  die  belang
van die blankes vooropgestel. Dit was mos verkeerd. Hand aan  hand  met  ons
bevryding in  Suid-Afrika,  word  Afrika  ook  nou  bevry.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, the vision of an African Renaissance has  given  rise  to  the
formation of the African Union in  its  current  form,  Nepad  and  all  the
associated structures. Today we can look back and say:  It  was  with  pride
that we witnessed and experienced  on  Sunday  how  Africa  has  arisen  and
accepted the responsibility to overcome her own challenges.

The formation of the AU, the creation of  Nepad  and  its  birth,  like  the
entire concept of the African  Renaissance,  can  be  examined  through  two
magnifying  glasses.  The  one  spotlight  will   certainly   search,   with
suspicion, for the new form of ``swart gevaar'' [black danger], and in  case
it is not obviously visible that spotlight will fall on where  it  might  be
hidden. The other, the right  and  positive  spotlight,  will  fall  on  the
opportunities that could be seized to make Africa a winning continent.  Like
many others, I wholeheartedly associate myself with the  opportunities  that
the AU and Nepad offer to us as Africans, to manage the  affairs  of  Africa
guided by specific  principles  -  African  principles  and  internationally
accepted principles; democratic, economic and social principles.

Broadly speaking Africa, particularly in the south, has basically had  three
political models since the 1800s. Not one has worked. We are  grateful  that
the AU is not focusing on that, and thus losing perspective of the future.

From 1840 to 1960 it was the period where the model of colonialism  was  the
order of the day. In colonial times  modest  infrastructure  was  developed,
but needless to  say,  the  colonialists  were  inclined  more  towards  the
training of  slaves  and  subjects,  rather  than  to  the  development  and
training of African leadership.  In  fact,  in  South  Africa  we  have  not
escaped this, because at the end of the day apartheid was  indeed  just  the
kidney stones of colonialism. Whereas  colonialism  exclusively  served  the
interest of the colonial powers, apartheid exclusively put the  interest  of
the whites first. Surely this was wrong. Hand in hand  with  the  liberation
of South Africa, Africa is now also being liberated.]

Mr Chairperson, in acknowledging that colonialism did  not  develop  African
leadership, the formation of the AU created high standards and  expectations
of current and future political, business and community leaders in  the  re-
creation  of  Africa.  Political  leadership  in  government  structures  is
expected to create an  environment  of  peace,  order  and  lawful  actions.
Economic leadership in business structures is expected to supply  the  basic
elements for economic growth, business development  and  sustainable  income
for the households of Africa. Leadership in civil  society  is  expected  to
keep people motivated and focused on the holistic role of  all  in  building
sound, reliable and healthy communities.

It is clear that the challenge for leadership  in  Africa,  and  for  us  as
Africans, is to take international and continental realities  into  account.
One such reality  which  poses  a  major  challenge  is  the  ever-deepening
digital and knowledge gap between and within countries. We as  Africans  are
faced with the challenge of bridging this gap and addressing  the  need  for
food security, clean water and basic health services.

In these efforts moral ethics, business leadership and leadership  in  civil
society must become an integral part of the reformation of Africa.
Net soos in Suid-Afrika, sal ons in Afrika die armes moed moet  gee  en  die
ontwikkelaars beskerming. Beide hierdie  groepe  is  deel  van  die  Afrika-
realiteit. Beide groepe sal benut moet word in ons strategie om Afrika  weer
'n  wen-kontinent  te  maak.  Die  onsekerheid  van   die   armes   en   die
ontwikkelaars moet die aandag van die Afrika leierskap hê  sodat  ons  hulle
inbinding vir ontwikkeling en groei kan hê.

Die wekroep moet wees: ``kom ons raak betrokke!''. Ons moet  ons  land,  ons
kontinent en ons planeet ontwikkel, eerder as  net  help.  Kom  ons  sê  dit
alles is nie Nepad, die AU  en  die  regering  se  plig  nie.  Die  tyd  het
aangebreek vir beide die sakesektor en  die  burgerlike  samelewing  om  ook
hulle kaarte op die tafel te plaas. Ons moet konkrete  planne  en  veral  'n
gesindheid demonstreer. Ons sal moet wegstuur daarvan om  die  aandelebeurse
en markte in te roep om die idees waarvan ons nie hou  nie,  te  straf.  Ons
sal mede-verantwoordelikheid vir ons land en kontinent moet aanvaar.

Die energie van die Afrikaners en ander  minderheidsgroepe  moet  tot  moue-
oprol oorgaan en seker maak dat  die  kinders  van  Afrika  'n  erfenis  kry
waarin hulle trotse Afrikane kan wees.

Dit is nou die tyd vir koel koppe en warm harte, want Afrika  moet  polities
en ekonomies ontwikkel word. Dis in hierdie konteks  wat  ons  saamstem  met
President Mbeki wanneer hy sê, ons kan nie die  moord  op  een  inwoner  van
Afrika deur 'n ander bekostig nie. Ons is almal Afrikane.

Ek stel voor  as  alternatief  vir  oorlog  praat,  dat  ons  versoening  en
ontwikkeling bepleit. Ek stel so voor, meneer,  want  rassehaat  en  etniese
konflik se drakebekke blaas vuur en swael en rook oor  ons  almal.  Ons  kan
die bloedige en bitter gevolge daarvan ontkom, mits ons as Afrikane saam  by
die fontein van versoening vergader om die reinigende en  helende  water  as
Afrikane te drink.

Ons krag as Afrikane lê in die diversiteit van die kulture  van  Afrika  wat
ons kan inspan as 'n krag om ons hartseer geskiedenis te breek. Dis  in  ons
vermoë om Afrika, ons kontinent, die gesamentlike tuiste van almal te maak.

Die Afrikaner en die bruin gemeenskap identifiseer nie  net  met  die  grond
van Afrika nie.  Ons  as  Afrikane  identifiseer  ook  met  die  mense,  die
probleme en die uitdagings van Afrika. Veral die  Afrikaner  het  nog  altyd
deur van hulle kultuurorganisasies gehoor dat ons 'n  goddelike  roeping  in
Afrika het. Daaraan het ek, soos baie ander, al was ons  nou  nie  lede  van
daardie organisasies nie, nooit getwyfel nie. Die feit bly, die tyd het  nou
aangebreek dat ons daardie roeping sal beantwoord en as Afrikane nie  verval
in die beheptheid van die sogenaamde Boetman-debat, of nog erger,  soos  die
Groep van 63 te wees wat niks anders is as 'n groepie mense wat hulle  ophou
met sekulêre Afrikanerdom nie.

'n Deel van ons hartseer geskiedenis is dat  daar  'n  tyd  was  toe  sekere
sogenaamde Afrikaner-ideoloë en sekere politici die pas aangegee en van  die
Afrikaanse kerke die morele argument verskaf  het,  alles  om  apartheid  te
regverdig. In hierdie proses was daar Afrikaners wat toe  al  Afrikane  was.
Ek dink hier aan W E G Louw en ds Nico Smith van  Stellenbosch  wat  hom  in
Mamelodi bevind het. Daar was ook andere wat  die  waarheid  gesien  het  en
bereid was om deur onbeskryflike opoffering die pad te wys vir die  geslagte
wat moes kom. Ons as Afrikane sê dankie aan hulle.

Ek weet 'n nuwe geslag het in  Suid-Afrika  en  Afrika  opgestaan.  Met  die
ontydige dood van  'n  groot  Afrikaan,  ons  kameraad  Walter  Sisulu,  het
hierdie volgende briefie wat ek wil aanhaal in die Beeld verskyn:


  Boetman treur.


  Hy is nie meer die bliksem in nie, nie bitter nie, nie vol wrewel nie.


  Nee, hy treur saam met die volk oor Walter Sisulu.


  'n Man wat Boetman nie mog ken nie - nie deur koerantberigte,  televisie-
  onderhoude of enige ander manier nie.


  Wat het die jare 60 en 70 nie aan ons gedoen nie! Dit het ons ons land se
  rolmodelle en helde ontneem.


  Vandag treur ons saam met die volk oor 'n groot man  -  en  ons  is  saam
  dankbaar dat hy op 'n manier ons pad gekruis het.

Ek en baie ander stem saam met Francois van Eldo Glen waar  hy  dit  in  die
Beeld skryf.

Om vir Chris Barnard, die skrywer, nie die hartpionier nie, oor die  bekende
sestigs aan te haal:  ``Die  hele  land  fuif  en  baljaar  en  ons  klompie
soekende siele soek steeds rigting, soek na mekaar, soek  na  ons  weet  nie
mooi wat nie.''

As ons oor die sestigs praat, dan sal dit mos onwaar wees om nie Adam  Small
te onthou nie. Sy gedigte wat met ons elkeen gepraat het. En  wie  sal  ooit
vergeet daai gedig van Adam Small wat sê  die  dice  het  vir  ons  verkeerd
geval?

Ek glo dis gepas om een van die Sestigers, Lina Spies, aan te haal  waar  sy
die Onse Vader gebed gevat het en eintlik  'n  Paternoster  vir  Suid-Afrika
geskryf het:


  Here laat die name geheilig word
  van al die kinders in hierdie land-
  van hulle
  wat modderkoekies gebak het uit sy aarde,
  dassies skrikgemaak het in sy klowe,
  wol getrap het in sy krale.

En later in daardie gedig sê sy:


  Vergewe ons, die vergeetagtiges, die uitgerustes,
  soos ons hulle vergewe, die luidrugtiges,
  wat nooit binne die kraal was nie,
  wat nooit rietperd gery
  en kaalvoet geloop het nie,
  En Here sien ons hande aan:
  Kyk, om my wit pols is 'n armband van gras
  my donker speelmaat het dit kunstig gevleg
  soos ek nooit kon nie ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[As in the case of South Africa, we will have to give  the  poor  in  Africa
courage and the  developers  protection.  Both  these  groups  are  part  of
Africa's reality. Both  these  groups  will  have  to  be  utilised  in  our
strategy to make Africa a winning continent again. The  uncertainty  of  the
poor and the developers must get attention from the  African  leadership  so
that they can have our commitment for development and growth.

The clarion call should be: ``Let us get involved!'' We must  be  developing
our country, our continent and our planet, rather than just  supporting  it.
Come, let us say that all of this is not only the duty of Nepad, the AU  and
the Government. The time has come for both the  business  sector  and  civil
society to put their cards on the table as well. We  must  display  concrete
plans and a particular disposition. We  must  avoid  relying  on  the  stock
exchange and markets to penalise the ideas we do not like. We will  have  to
accept co-responsibility for our country and continent.

The energy of the Afrikaners and other minority groups must proceed  to  the
rolling up of sleeves to ensure that the children of Africa get a legacy  in
which they can be proud Africans.

Now is the time for cool heads and  warm  hearts,  because  politically  and
economically Africa will have to be developed. It is in  this  context  that
we agree with President Mbeki when he says that we cannot afford the  murder
of one inhabitant of Africa by another. We are all Africans.

As an alternative to war talk, I suggest that we appeal  for  reconciliation
and development. I suggest this, Sir, because the dragon  mouths  of  racial
hatred and ethnic conflict are spitting fire and sulphur and smoke over  all
of us. We can escape its bloody and bitter consequences,  provided  that  we
as Africans gather together at the fountain of reconciliation to  drink  its
purifying and healing water, as Africans.
As Africans our strength lies in the diversity of Africa's  cultures,  which
we can use as a force to break our sad history. It is within  our  power  to
make Africa, our continent, the collective home of all.

The Afrikaner and coloured communities not only identify with  the  land  of
Africa. We as Africans also identify  with  the  people,  the  problems  and
challenges of Africa. The Afrikaner, in particular, has  always  heard  from
their cultural organisations that we have a divine  calling  in  Africa.  I,
like many others, although we were never  members  of  those  organisations,
have never had any doubt about that. The fact  remains,  the  time  has  now
come for us to acknowledge that calling and,  as  Africans,  not  to  settle
into an obsession with the so-called ``Boetman'' debate, or even  worse,  be
like the Group of 63 that is nothing more than a small group of  people  who
spend their time on secular Afrikanerdom.

A part of our sad history is that there was a time  when  certain  so-called
Afrikaner ideologues, and certain politicians, set the pace and some of  the
Afrikaans churches provided the moral  argument,  all  of  this  to  justify
apartheid. In this process there were, by then already, Afrikaners who  were
Africans. Here I am thinking of W E G  Louw  and  of  Rev  Nico  Smith  from
Stellenbosch, who found himself in Mamelodi. And there were also others  who
saw the truth and were prepared, through indescribable  sacrifice,  to  show
the way to the generations still to come. We as Africans thank them.

I know a new generation has arisen in South  Africa  and  Africa.  With  the
untimely death of a great African, our Comrade Walter Sisulu, the  following
letter, that I would like to quote, appeared in Beeld:


  Boetman treur.


  Hy is nie meer die bliksem in nie, nie bitter nie, nie vol wrewel nie.


  Nee, hy treur saam met die volk oor Walter Sisulu.
  'n Man wat Boetman nie mog ken nie - nie deur  koerantberigte,  televisie
  onderhoude of enige ander manier nie.


  Wat het die jare 60 en 70 nie aan ons gedoen nie! Dit het ons ons land se
  rolmodelle en helde ontneem.


  Vandag treur ons saam met die volk oor 'n groot man  -  en  ons  is  saam
  dankbaar dat hy op 'n manier ons pad gekruis het.

Like many others, I agree with Francois from Eldo Glen when he  writes  this
in Beeld.

To quote Chris Barnard the author, not the heart pioneer,  about  the  well-
known sixties: ``Die hele land fuif  en  baljaar  en  ons  klompie  soekende
siele soek steeds rigting, soek na mekaar, soek na ons  weet  nie  mooi  wat
nie.''

When we talk about the sixties, it  will  be  wrong  not  to  remember  Adam
Small. His poetry was talking to every one of us. And who  can  ever  forget
Adam Small's poem that says the dice were loaded against us.

I believe it is appropriate to quote one of the sixties poets,  Lina  Spies,
when she took the Our Father prayer and actually  wrote  a  Paternoster  for
South Africa:]


  Here laat die name geheilig word
  van al die kinders in hierdie land -
  van hulle
  wat modderkoekies gebak het uit sy aarde,
  dassies skrikgemaak het in sy klowe,
  wol getrap het in sy krale.

And further on in that poem she says:


  Vergewe ons, die vergeetagtiges, die uitgerustes,
  soos ons hulle vergewe, die luidrugtiges,
  wat nooit binne die kraal was nie,
  wat nooit rietperd gery
  en kaalvoet geloop het nie,
  En Here sien ons hande aan:
  Kyk, om my wit pols is 'n armband van gras
  my donker speelmaat het dit kunstig gevleg
  soos ek nooit kon nie ...]

Chairperson, at times I leave South  Africa  on  business  or  to  attend  a
conference or just on a holiday trip. But, Sir, I always come back  home  to
live.

My soul is in Africa; my body is in Africa. My parents,  their  parents  and
my great-grandparents were of Africa. They  sustained  themselves  and  they
sustained me with whatever my country, South  Africa,  had  to  offer,  both
materially and spiritually.

It is not only the hills, the rivers and the natural  resources  which  have
sustained and continue to sustain me. I have  learnt  that,  notwithstanding
what has happened in the past, the present affords us all.

Today, the forgiveness that has  been  demonstrated  by  my  fellow  African
brothers and sisters towards their fellow compatriots for  the  misdeeds  of
apartheid and  colonialism  makes  me  proud  that  I  have  the  historical
privilege of being part of this African ethos - an ethos in which  there  is
no revenge and hate and that, on the basis of  ubuntu,  loosely  translated:
``I am, because you are''. This is sufficient reason for me  to  declare:  I
am an African. [Applause.]

But more than this, it is only because I am firstly a human being  and  then
an African, that my Africanness calls  on  me  to  shoulder  and  share  the
responsibility of  leading  our  fellow  compatriots  from  their  state  of
unfreedom.

It was and is because of this duty that I  recall  the  sacrifices  made  by
fellow Afrikaners like the late Bram Fischer. In apartheid South  Africa  he
could have been a minister or even prime  minister.  Instead  he  chose  the
path of the truth, the path of ubuntu and died in prison. Bram  Fischer  was
an African. [Applause.]

It was and is because of this reason that the Rev  Beyers  Naudé,  a  former
member of the Broederbond, was  excommunicated  from  his  church.  But,  as
Afrikaner and an African, my soul is at peace.  Why?  Because  Oom  Bey  has
been re-admitted to his church. He did what he did and he does what he  does
as Beyers Naudé,  because  as  an  African  he  understood  and  understands
ubuntu. As an African he chose to be a living witness of reconciliation.

It is because of this, the pursuit of freedom and the truth of ubuntu,  that
our  fellow  Afrikaans-speaking  compatriots  are  beginning  to  share  and
shoulder the responsibility of making a better life  for  all  and  to  push
back the frontiers of poverty.

As an African I salute the efforts made by my African  compatriots,  whether
in Stellenbosch, Pretoria or elsewhere, to make South Africa  and  Africa  a
better place for all to live in - black and white.

It is because I am a human being and an African that I call upon  my  fellow
Africans to become part of the team, to  become  a  player  on  the  playing
field. I call upon them to begin sharing their expertise and  to  assist  in
the transfer of skills so that we succeed in creating a better life for  all
and to push back the frontiers of poverty in  Africa  and  South  Africa.  I
would be ignoring reality if I didn't call  upon  the  Afrikaners,  who  are
Africans, to share their land in order to  redress  the  imbalances  of  the
past. [Applause.]

I am proud that these compatriots  share  the  pride  of  being  an  African
through their deeds. They do so all the  more,  because  they  are  here  in
Africa, body and soul.

These and many more who have committed themselves to changing  South  Africa
into a viable and prosperous country, are indeed  embarrassed  by  the  foul
deeds of some who engage in subversion,  economic  exploitation  and  racial
prejudice.

As an African, Sir, in closing, I have faith in the  future  generations  of
Afrikaners who are fortunate  to  have  inherited  the  virtues  of  ubuntu,
democracy, justice, peace and harmony from our  fellow  South  Africans  who
were, until recently, oppressed, repressed and dispossessed.

It is this faith that adds to my declaration: I am an  African.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Mnr die Voorsitter, die agb Oosthuizen het 'n  paar  mooi
dinge gesê. Hy het seker vir hom 'n mooi paadjie oopgekap na  die  leierskap
van  sy  nuwe  party,  en  ek  wens  hom  geluk  daarmee.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr Chairman, the  hon  Oosthuizen  said  a  few  fine-sounding  things.  He
probably blazed  a  trail  to  the  leadership  of  his  new  party,  and  I
congratulate him on that. [Interjections.]]

I would like the hon Oosthuizen to remember that South Africans  are  taking
Africa seriously. South Africans are designing  the  road  from  Mombasa  to
Kampala. South African companies are building the new National Bank  in  Dar
es Salaam. South African companies have done all the  design  work  for  the
biggest housing estate in the whole of Africa in the  city  of  Luanda,  and
the list can go on. South Africa is making its way in Africa.

The OAU has served its purpose. It is now gone and Africa now looks  to  the
future. Our President recognises this and his leadership  role  in  the  new
African Union and his vision in the form of the  development  instrument  of
Nepad  is  a  bold  initiative.  Nepad  is  the  critical   factor   because
investment,  economic  growth,  development  of  infrastructure  and   human
development must be the partner and foundation of democracy.  In  the  Great
Lakes region and in the DRC, Presidents Mandela  and  now  Mbeki  have  been
true servant leaders in trying to end  the  suffering  of  people  there  by
trying to stop the killing. In African tradition, on behalf  of  those  they
are helping, we thank them most sincerely.

The real and sustainable future for Africa  is  being  battled  for  by  our
people as we strive to democratically choose our governments. In Nigeria  we
have had a great victory for democracy. Kenya is a shining example  of  what
the new Africa wants. There are people that  were  made  angry  by  the  old
corrupt crony regime, threw out a government that represented  the  old  OAU
with its style of arrogant and unprincipled leadership.  They  even  brought
in Uhuru Kenyatta with all those emotional  appeals  and  still  the  people
rejected him. What do they do  in  Kenya?  They  now  talk  about  a  second
liberation, and they elected the Rainbow Coalition to power.

The old and the new Africa are struggling next door to us  in  Zimbabwe.  In
June 2000 our observer team saw at close quarters how the Mugabe  government
set  about  violently  intimidating  their  political  opponents.  The   hon
Mesdames Mapisa-Nqakula, Van der Merwe and  Lobe  saw  and  heard  what  was
going on but, like the three monkeys, they chose to hear  no  evil,  see  no
evil and they didn't want to speak about any evil. They  cannot  wash  their
hands off that situation.

Ngifuna ukubuza uHulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose ukuthi, Nincengani  kuMugabe?
UMugabe  noMnangagwa  babulala   abantu   baseMatebeleland   ngegukarahundi;
uMugabe uzonda abelungu  ne-MDC;  futhi  uxosha  kanti  uhlukumenza  abalimi
bakhe   nabantu   abantsundu   abasebenza   emapulazini.    Iqembu    le-MDC
uyalicindezela, uligaya njengembokodo.  Kungani  uHulumeni  wethu  engamathe
nolimi noMugabe? (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[I want to ask the ANC-led Government, what do you seek from Mugabe?  Mugabe
and Mnangagwa killed their people in Matebeleland in  the  crushing;  Mugabe
hates whites and the MDC; he evicts and abuses his farmers  and  black  farm
workers. He oppresses the MDC and crushes it  like  a  grinding  stone.  Why
does our Government cling to Mugabe?]

The answer is a simple one: It is  socialist  struggle  solidarity,  with  a
nasty black racist ingredient added. A  few  months  ago,  our  Minister  of
Foreign Affairs said, ``to oppose land reform would  be  antirevolutionary''
and this despite everybody in Zimbabwe knowing that  the  land  issue  is  a
smokescreen created by Mugabe. This  is  despite  the  fact  that  President
Mbeki told South Africa in December at the ANC congress  that  the  ANC  has
never been a socialist party.

Mr Mbeki has been elected as our President  to  look  after  South  Africa's
interests. While President Mugabe causes huge and direct human and  economic
damage to South Africa, and while he destroys his country and oppresses  his
people, our President treats him  like  a  dear  old  uncle.  What  kind  of
leadership is this, and how can the world have confidence  in  the  AU  when
its first chairman does not effectively address the Zimbabwe issue? Who  are
his intelligence advisors? They are clearly not Mr Zwelinzima Vavi  who  has
never excused nor been shy to criticise the state of  affairs  in  Zimbabwe.
On Zimbabwe, President Mugabe's politically immoral stance has  done  damage
to the Commonwealth. [Interjections.]

The tide of the new Africa is to be seen in Kenya, Nigeria and in  Zimbabwe.
Let  us  work  towards  practical  and   peaceful   co-operation,   economic
development, peace and prosperity. Then we  can  sing,  ``Jabulani  Jabulani
Africa''. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, this morning  I  made  a
briefing to the Portfolio Committee on  Correctional  Services.  I  can  see
some of the hon members who were  there  saying,  when  I  came  up  to  the
podium, ``No, not again; not the prison overcrowding  issue  again.''  I  am
not going to  talk  about  it  this  time.  I  am  going  to  say  something
different.

I believe that it is opportune  and  proper  for  this  august  Assembly  to
commend the people of South Africa.  joined  by  their  friends  from  other
African countries,  for  the  joyous  and  majestic  manner  in  which  they
celebrated Africa week and eventually Africa Day on 25 May 2003 in  Gauteng.
South Africa demonstrated what is befitting of  the  Chair  of  the  African
Union.

The Renaissance African believes that the new  Africa  is  a  society  where
matter is brought into harmony with experience, and therefore ceases  to  be
the master over the mind; an African society where the attainment of  mental
emancipation becomes a preoccupation of the apostle or the disciple  of  the
African Renaissance.

This architect of  the  new  Africa  strives  to  rid  the  African  of  all
complexes that seek to retard his growth towards manhood in the  theatre  of
nations. Like a sleeping giant, it is now time to wake to up to harness  his
powers for his own good and that of mankind.

When addressing the Corporate Council Summit in Chantilly, Virginia, USA  in
April 1997, the then Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, briefly admonished,  and
I quote:


  Those who have eyes to see, let them see. The African Renaissance is upon
  us. As we peer through the looking glass darkly, this may not be obvious.
  But it is upon us.


  What we have been talking about  is  the  establishment  of  genuine  and
  stable democracies in Africa, in which the  systems  of  governance  will
  flourish because they derive their authority and legitimacy from the will
  of the people.

Many abroad and within South Africa, when he said that, heard in  his  words
the embrace of a resurgence of African nationalism to  the  total  exclusion
of other racial groups and, as a result, not many South African leaders  and
politicians  openly  associated  their  views  with  this  idea,  which  was
obviously a misconception on their part.

When addressing an assembly of the United World College of  Southern  Africa
in Waterford, Swaziland, on  the  tradition  and  the  modern  state  on  21
November 1997, the Minister of Home Affairs, Dr M G  Buthelezi,  said  these
words in support of the idea of an African Renaissance:


  We believe that we need to develop a  process  which  moves  the  African
  experience towards  the  centre  stage  of  our  society,  after  it  was
  marginalised for so long by the pre-eminence acquired by western cultures
  and traditions.

That was from the Kamhlaba Lecture in 1997.

These words that were said in two different countries at different times  by
two African leaders from one country reflect the enriching  re-appraisal  of
the African psyche and thinking for decades by  prominent  African  leaders,
philosophers, writers, intellectuals and social scientists who believe  that
Africa will prosper and develop when it believes  in  itself  and  not  when
Africa rejects itself. The quest and the struggle to  have  Africa's  future
influenced through the historical,  linguistic  and  cultural  consciousness
must remain as powerful, relentless and resilient as  the  African  peoples'
struggle against the evils of colonialism and apartheid.

The new Africa, I believe, must not jettison but revive and  regenerate  the
core African value systems in order to succeed in extinguishing  the  flames
of intra- and interstate armed conflicts. In order to  succeed  in  fighting
the scourge of private and public institutional corruption, crime,  poverty,
unemployment, diseases, illiteracy and  general  underdevelopment,  the  new
Africa must continue to anchor firmly  the  moral  fibre  and  stability  of
African societies, communities and family units.

The Foreign and the Defence Ministers of Africa are  presently  deliberating
hard on the  fundamental  issues  of  regional  and  continental  peace  and
security arrangements. With this should obviously come into sharp focus  the
questions  of  human  rights,  the  rule  of  law,  international  morality,
democracy and good governance.

However, notwithstanding all this, central to my concern is the fear of  the
idea that, in our passionate embrace of  the  African  Renaissance,  we  may
hasten to consolidate the roof of the African hut and totally lose sight  of
solidifying the support foundation which is  the  South  African  nationhood
and the  African  philosophy.  Our  Ubuntu/Botho,  our  African  traditional
leadership institutions and cultural heritage need  our  commitment  in  the
true spirit of national consciousness.
Contributing to the African Reader in the 1970 edition  of  The  Independent
Africa, the articulators of freedoms wrote:


  Nevertheless,  Senghor  and  many  other  artist-intellectuals  have  not
  escaped the dilemma delineated  by  Frantz  Fanon.  While  asserting  the
  values of the African past  and  African  culture,  and  envisioning  the
  continental and universal ideas for Africa, they seem to  set  aside  for
  the moment the particular social and political  realities  of  their  own
  historical context. The intellectual has at least two responsibilities in
  his society: first to perceive  what  is  good  for  his  country,  while
  holding intact the traditions of the past; and secondly  to  prepare  his
  community for a good decolonisation, for true independence.''

Introducing  Afrocentricity,  Molefe  strongly  advised   that   it   is   a
fundamental necessity for African liberation to take place at the  level  of
the psychological, economic, social, political and cultural.
In conclusion, let me say, today in our celebration of  Africa  Day,  marked
by 40 years of solidarity in the struggle to a century of unity  and  peace,
we are also saying to the prominent and perceptive  African  writer,  Chinua
Achebe, yes, things did fall apart in  Africa,  but  now  with  the  African
Union, with the New Partnership for Africa's  Development,  Nepad,  the  new
Africa is gathering things together. The new  Africa  no  longer  wishes  to
poison the nuts that she feeds to her friends,  but  Africa  wants  to  feed
herself and all her children and friends the nourishing nuts of  prosperity,
development, peace and security. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mr Chairman, the one undisputed achievement  of  the  OAU,
``with a little help from our friends'', is that colonialism  and  apartheid
have come to an end. In a way it has also been a preparation for the  AU  in
that we can learn from the mistakes  and  failures  of  the  OAU  and  avoid
repeating them. It was also a necessary  step  toward  the  emancipation  of
Africa.

Trawling through the media last week has been an interesting  exercise  and,
generally speaking, the press  has  to  be  commended  for  the  variety  of
perspectives it reflected, and the serious thinking underlying some  of  the
more insightful perspectives it brought to the debate. Africa  pessimism  is
a reality that has to be dealt with - and the media  reflected  this  -  but
helpful analyses received considerable space.

Ons leef in 'n bevoorregte tydvak: DNA is ontleed, die  menslike  genoom  is
gekarteer, die hemelruimte begin om sy  geheimenisse  te  ontbloot,  en  ons
aardse verlede verdiep en verleng met die studie  van  die  aardwetenskappe.
Wie sou kon dink dat ons noukeurig sou kon bepaal presies  watter  dele  van
die aarde deur ten  minste  drie  afsmeltingsepisodes  oor  'n  tydperk  van
ongeveer 35 000 jaar onder die see verdwyn het, en  dat  ons  nou  'n  insae
begin kry in  die  omvang  van  die  beskawingsverliese  wat  ouer,  vroeëre
natuurrampe veroorsaak het? Vermenigvuldig die beweging  van  die  Algerynse
aardkors tienvoudig en die hele Algerië is weg. Daar moet op 'n nuwe  manier
na Afrika en sy mense binne die konteks van  die  natuurgeskiedenis,  en  in
samehang met die verloop van politieke en  ekonomiese  ontwikkeling  in  die
res  van  die  wêreld  gekyk  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[We are living in a privileged era: DNA has been analysed, the human  genome
has been charted, the heavens are beginning to  reveal  their  secrets,  and
our earthly past is deepening and lengthening with the study  of  the  earth
sciences. Who would have thought that we would have been able  to  determine
precisely which parts of the earth had disappeared under the  ocean  through
at least three melting-down episodes over a period of approximately  35  000
years, and that we would now be beginning to gain an  understanding  of  the
scope  of  the  civilisation  losses  caused  by  older,   earlier   natural
disasters? Multiply the movement of the Algerian  earth  crust  tenfold  and
the whole of Algeria  would  be  gone.  Africa  and  its  people  should  be
regarded in a new  way  within  the  context  of  natural  history,  and  in
interdependence with the course of political  and  economic  development  in
the rest of the world.]

It is clear that the vast scientific knowledge and new insights gained  over
the past few decades already underpin globalisation and should be  exploited
to benefit Africa to a greater degree.  Africa  itself  needs  to  turn  its
inward glance up and out and begin to work on  its  connectedness  with  the
advanced, modern and indeed ancient societies as well. The new  world  order
requires a clearer understanding of identity and its function as a  building
block within the community and society  at  large,  but  also  globally.  It
would be short-sighted to take  up  an  antagonistic  position  against  the
successful and powerful nations in the world. Interdependence is a  reality,
and what you sow today, you will reap tomorrow.

The great powers of our day also need to  internalise  this  in  a  positive
way. Contemporary religio-cultural distinctions between Africa and the  West
do not cancel out shared history and  common  human  descent.  Africans  are
related to the people of Europe and  America  by  blood  and  culture  as  a
consequence of modern, as well as early history. Accepting  this  fact  will
make us stronger.
Dit is duidelik dat die Konstitusionele  Akte  van  die  AU  en  die  Nepad-
program juis ons erfenis in berekening bring. Om gestalte  te  gee  aan  dié
visie is wat wysheid en moed verg - ook die politieke voetwerk.  Die  ideale
van   demokrasie,   maatskaplike   regverdigheid   en   voorspoed   is   nie
onversoenbaar met die eiesoortigheid van Afrika-waardes nie.

Elke keer wanneer daar gepraat  word  van  Afrika-tradisie  en  -kultuur  as
dekmantel vir  die  miskenning  van  menseregte  van  byvoorbeeld  vroue  en
kinders, of etniese minderhede, is dit vals én ondermyn dit die  ideaal  van
die opheffing van Afrika, en dít moet end kry. Hiervoor is leierskap  nodig.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is clear that the Constitutional Act of the AU and the  Nepad  programme
specifically take our heritage into consideration.  Giving  effect  to  this
vision is what requires wisdom and courage - also  the  political  footwork.
The  ideals  of  democracy,  social   justice   and   prosperity   are   not
irreconcilable with the uniqueness of African values.

Every time there is talk of African tradition and culture as a  pretext  for
the disregard of human rights of women and  children,  for  example,  or  of
ethnic minorities, it is false and undermines the ideal  of  the  upliftment
of Africa, and  there  must  be  an  end  to  it.  For  this  leadership  is
essential.]

Violence, crime and poverty bedevil our quest, but at the root of these  lie
a lack of education, sound moral training and upbringing.  Fifty-five  years
ago, the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights  established  that  everyone
has the right to  education.  Out  of  the  millions  of  children  on  this
continent who are not in school, the majority are girls. Now, we  know  that
if you educate girls and women, you have the most effective  instrument  for
development. Every child on this continent needs  to  be  in  school,  every
girl alongside every boy. Educated people know what  they  are,  where  they
come from, and where they are going. Education is the key to  unlocking  the
potential of Africa.
The New NP is committed to the development of Africa, our home.

Ms H M MPAKA: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members, in the past the heads  of
state and governments of the  member  states  of  the  Organisation  of  the
African Unity, among others, recalled the  heroic  struggles  waged  by  our
people and our countries  for  political  independence,  human  dignity  and
economic emancipation, determined to promote and protect human and  people's
rights to consolidate democratic institutions  and  culture  and  to  ensure
good governance and rule of law.

Africa celebrated its 40 years of solidarity in struggle  to  a  century  of
unity and peace on May 25, which was the day on which  the  Organisation  of
African Unity was launched in 1963 to put  an  end  to  colonialism  and  to
unite the peoples of Africa. Since then the continent's leaders  inaugurated
its successor, the African Union, in July 2002 in Durban.

The ANC, at its Stellenbosch Conference, has committed itself  to  promoting
and protecting indigenous knowledge systems as part  of  our  transformation
process and as an integral part of Nepad.

The ANC-led  Government  has  taken  its  rightful  place  in  international
relations, playing a leading role within  the  United  Nations,  Non-Aligned
Movement and other international organisations. The progress  made  by  this
ANC-led Government in the  resolution  of  conflicts  in  Angola,  the  DRC,
Sierra Leone, Burundi, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea and other countries  through
the involvement of African multilateral institutions show that  there  is  a
need for South Africans to say ``Thank you''  to  the  rest  of  Africa  for
supporting us during our liberation struggle.

The involvement of the continent  through  solidarity  and  support  was  on
education. On behalf of the ANC, I am proud to mention that  today  we  have
this current Government because of the continent's contribution. To  mention
a few examples,  we  have  DG's,  DDGs,  Ministers,  etc  in  key  strategic
positions that are being occupied by the people of this country  because  of
the education they obtained in other countries on the continent. During  the
dark days of apartheid, they  gave  us  material  support  in  the  form  of
clothing  and  accommodation.  They  gave  us  liberation  struggle  support
through sanctions and the isolation  campaign  against  apartheid  in  South
Africa, which also included frontline  states,  civil  society,  governments
and people of the continent. As South  Africans,  it  is  important  to  say
``Thank you'' to the rest of Africa for  supporting  us  in  our  liberation
struggle. Where would this country be without your support? [Applause.]

When we talk about the rich African heritage, culture and  values,  what  we
are talking about? We need to understand what it is that makes  us  African.
What are these African values? The quick answer that comes in one's mind  is
``ubuntu'', which raises another question, and that is: What is  ``ubuntu''?
Ubuntu is about humanism, being part of a community,  sharing,  as  well  as
interdependency. We  internalise  these  values  through  the  socialisation
process. Individualism is not part of the African culture.

The African culture is very rich, especially when  it  comes  to  knowledge.
Earlier I made mention of indigenous  knowledge  systems  in  which  African
practices were set up to raise generations who would respect  these  values,
the values of bringing up of children.

This ANC-led Government has begun a joint programme that seeks to work  with
the scientific medical fraternity and traditional healers in  attempting  to
develop  the  undeveloped  technologies  as  part   of   acknowledging   the
importance  of  the  indigenous  knowledge  systems  in  our  country.  This
Government has realised that  the  indigenous  knowledge  systems  have  the
potential also to  contribute  to  the  transformation  and  paradigm  shift
within institutions, with the orientation that the human being  comes  first
and that our environment, the earth, its resources, both natural and  human,
must be conserved and preserved for life.
It has the possibilities to let  emerge  knowledge  and  liberatory  process
through its language, philosophy,  culture  and  institutions  which  are  a
natural resource and heritage.

Africans would make a meaningful expression in communicating our values.  If
I may cite one example from the performing  arts,  which  is  not  different
from ballet, it is umxhentso, a Xhosa  dance,  which  was  done  by  African
artists at the Johannesburg Stadium during celebrations, especially  by  the
Congolese artists.

The length and the breadth of the continent are peopled by  a  diversity  of
cultures, including those of the  colonialists.  These  indigenous  cultures
have this  in  common:  languages,  customs,  traditions  and  eventually  a
diversity of rules approaching, engaging, harnessing and  utilising  nature,
not from an individualistic and  competitive  point  of  view,  but  from  a
collective and communal position. Research must be done on languages on  the
African continent with special emphasis on finding  the  common  trends  and
patterns which must  point  to  their  common  roots,  the  issue  being  to
establish a point of reference which can be a basis  to  find  solutions  to
problems and conflicts emanating from tribalism.

Moral regeneration is attempting to address  these  values  because  of  our
cultural diversity and tolerance, which is  another  value  that  goes  with
reconciliation within families if we  are  to  live  as  communities.  Other
countries have made the revival of Africanness. That is why we are the  last
ones to be liberated.

We Africans need to sort  out  our  problem,  that  is,  by  developing  and
protecting value regeneration. Nepad is a channel to  attempt  to  eradicate
poverty in Africa, poverty of moral values. Africa Day should also be  about
African values and  the  eradication  of  poverty  values.  African  values,
culture and beliefs have community values which are rich in  terms  of  oral
tradition. The challenge that is facing Africans  in  this  century  is  the
issue of xenophobia which was created by  colonialism  through  geographical
borders that were imposed on us with the intention of  dividing  the  people
of the continent.

Africa has been the base and centre of knowledge, culture and  civilisation.
I am raising this because research has shown the rich  African  heritage  in
that there were manuscripts in Mali which were preserved by women more  than
100 years ago which clearly show that the people  of  Africa  were  able  to
read and write then, even before the advent of  colonialism.  African  cloth
discovery is used for  modernised  garments,  and  writing  and  mathematics
evolved out of North Africa.

In the Sahara desert, the Egyptian pyramids are one of  the  heritage  sites
in Africa recognised by the Guinness books as one of the  seven  wonders  of
the world, including smeltering of gold and iron using substance tools.

Just to elaborate further on this cultural  dynamism,  this  Government  has
embarked on a pilot project called the Timbuktu Libraries project  which  is
a Malian-based initiative supported by a team of national and  international
experts in the field of history of Islamic  thought  in  Africa,  paper  and
binding restoration,  and  physical  conservation  and  electronic  document
management. This pilot project was launched in October  2000  and  was  also
supported by Unesco  for  training  in  digital  archiving  and  by  the  US
government for research on conflict resolution. The  ultimate  goal  of  the
Timbuktu Libraries project is to preserve and promote wide  access  to  this
unique African cultural and  literary  heritage  held  in  both  public  and
private collections of manuscripts in the Timbuktu area. One of the  primary
goals of  the  said  project  is  to  increase  awareness  of  the  literary
heritage.

International communities took 31 years to understand that  our  culture  is
not only tangible, but that this tangible cultural heritage  is  transmitted
from generation to generation, and is constantly re-created  by  communities
and groups in response to their environment, their interaction  with  nature
and their historical conditions of existence, and it provides  them  with  a
sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting the  respect  for  cultural
diversity and human creativity.

There is, in different countries of  the  continent,  different  and  almost
informal or alternative knowledge systems which the majority of  our  people
have put in place as a protection of who we are, how we do  things,  how  we
engage the hostile environment to survive and how we engage  and  deal  with
other people. Cultural greetings, as  an  example,  are  part  of  community
bonding and concentration of relations.

We the ANC  today  are  proud  to  mention  that  Government  had  lined  up
activities, including a SADC Multidisciplinary Festival which  started  from
18 May to 25 May 2003 at various venues in Gauteng  which  aimed  at,  among
others, promoting culture in the region as a means of promoting  closer  co-
operation in pursuit of the realisation of the African Renaissance  and  the
New Partnership for Africa's Development.

Thank you. [Applause.]
Adv Z L  MADASA:  Solidarity  means  unity  based  on  common  interests  or
feelings. While we correctly celebrate 40 years of the now defunct  OAU  for
championing solidarity for political liberation from  colonialism,  the  OAU
has left us with another legacy of solidarity.

Over  the  years  we  have  seen  the  emergence  of  a  new  ruling   elite
characterised by an insatiable appetite for power  and  riches.  Ironically,
this elite, to succeed in its endeavours, has had to  collaborate  with  the
erstwhile colonial powers, either to loot national resources or to  help  to
store them away in secrecy.

We only speak or hear about tribalism or religion  as  the  major  cause  of
conflicts in this continent.  Whilst  this  may  be  true,  there  is  ample
evidence indicating that the root cause of the so-called tribal  wars  is  a
scramble for power and access to resources.

Those of us who are the people's representatives, not just of our  political
parties, need to speak out on their behalf.

Africa needs a new breed of public representatives who  are  truly  servants
of the people, who will be vigilant against  party  authoritarianism,  which
has been one of  the  means  by  which  dictatorships  have  arisen  on  the
continent; representatives who will not keep quiet when  policies  that  are
detrimental  to  human  development  and  food  security  are  hatched   and
implemented.

A century of unity and peace will come  when  the  people's  representatives
become what we should be: bold and  fearless  voices  of  the  marginalised,
calling on the ruling elite to account.

Will the AU have solidarity with these corrupt dictators  because  of  their
past contributions to the struggle, or will they be purged of their  present
indefensible behaviour? That is the question. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek is van Afrika en ek is 'n  Afrikaner
en hoef gelukkig nie  by  die  ANC  aan  te  sluit  om  dit  te  bewys  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Mr Chairperson, I am from Africa and I  am  an  Afrikaner
and  fortunately  do  not  have   to   join   the   ANC   to   prove   this.
[Interjections.]]

We are discussing 40 years of the African Union and  the  future  of  Africa
today. Was the  OAU  a  success?  To  determine  that  you  must  judge  the
organisation against its aims. If the aim was to fight  colonialisation  and
the South African government, then surely it was  a  success.  However,  the
Idi Amins and the Mobutus, those African leaders who gave Africa a bad  name
internationally, never had anything to fear from the OAU.

If the aim of the OAU was to democratise Africa,  to  promote  human  rights
and fight corruption, then the OAU was a dismal failure. Here  is  just  one
statistic: In 1990, after almost 30 years of the  OAU,  of  the  53  African
states, only 9 could be described  as  having  multiparty  democracies.  The
positive statistic is that this changed drastically over the past 10  years:
Today 39 states  can  be  called  democracies.  The  OAU  could  argue  that
promoting human rights in Africa was not its aim. The same  cannot  be  said
of the new African Union.

The aim of  the  AU  is  exactly  that:  Promoting  human  rights,  fighting
corruption and democratising Africa. President Mbeki said on  Saturday  that
tribalism is one of the biggest problems in Africa. He said that  we  cannot
afford the slaughter of one African by another - Tutsi  and  Hutu  are  both
African. I agree.

What President Mbeki calls tribalism in Africa is called  ethnicity,  plural
societies and minority rights in the rest of the world.

Daar is oplossings daarvoor. Dit is nie nodig om die wiel van vooraf uit  te
vind om hierdie probleme  op  te  los  nie.  Tans  is  die  ANC-regering  se
oplossing vir hierdie probleme in Afrika en in Suid-Afrika  om  'n  regering
van nasionale eenheid te vorm  en  dan  tussen  die  groepe  geweld  met  'n
vredesmag te voorkom. So 'n regering van nasionale eenheid  is  altyd  slegs
'n oorgangsoplossing en nooit 'n permanente oplossing nie, en  'n  vredesmag
kan ook net tydelik help. Minderhede in Afrika moet  geakkommodeer  word  en
ruimte gegun word om hulself te wees. Dit geld vir Tutsi en Hutu,  Afrikaner
en Sotho - daarin lê die oplossing. Moenie dat ons  al  die  foute  van  die
verlede  herhaal  nie.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[There are solutions for this. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel  in
order to solve these problems. Currently the ANC  Government's  solution  to
these problems in Africa and in South Africa is  to  form  a  government  of
national unity and then prevent violence between the groups by  means  of  a
peace force. Such a government of national unity is always only  an  interim
solution and never a permanent solution, and a peace  force  can  only  help
temporarily. Minorities in Africa have to be accommodated and granted  space
to be themselves. This goes for the Tutsi and the Hutu, Afrikaner and  Sotho
- therein lies the solution. Let us not repeat all of the mistakes from  the
past. I thank you.]
Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, it is a fitting tribute  to  the  founding
fathers of the OAU to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the  OAU  since  its
inception in 1963 in this fashion as we enter the new era to make  the  21st
century an African century.

As we celebrate this anniversary, we are reminded of  our  past,  as  it  is
easy for people to forget where they came from. It  is  important  that  the
history of the OAU is preserved so that the next generation will be able  to
appreciate the role this institution  and  its  leadership  played.  We  are
specifically proud of all those who sacrificed their lives to bring us  this
independence from colonisers who partitioned and  owned  Africa  to  satisfy
their quest for total domination. They plundered and stripped her  treasures
and cultural wealth.

The OAU should also be credited for bringing to the fore the issue of  self-
reliance as a concept aimed at promoting self-empowerment  for  Africans  to
get things  done  on  their  own.  This  mass  realisation  marked  a  major
achievement in the history of the OAU. There are  other  notable  milestones
achieved in bringing about unity within member states.

However, the replacement of the  OAU  by  the  AU  should  be  viewed  as  a
response to the continent's contemporary challenges. The  AU  is  challenged
specifically to concretise and  carry  forward  the  struggles,  ideals  and
visions of the continent to a different level, that is, to truly  achieve  a
continent that is free from poverty,  disease,  internal  wars,  corruption,
illiteracy, unemployment, dictatorship and  other  challenges  that  we  are
faced with today.

This transition aims to strengthen and  consolidate  Africa  to  resolve  to
give her citizens a new hope and determination to bring  about  a  continent
that  is  free  and  prosperous.  It  is  our  firm  belief  that  with  the
introduction of Nepad, the vision of the OAU will be realised.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, 40 years's preoccupation and grappling with  the
vision of a united Africa is no mean achievement and calls for  celebration.
This is a vision which, once it grabs you, will not  let  you  go,  whatever
happens - Nomakanjani.

We rightly pause to pay tribute to pioneer  leaders  and  philosophers  like
Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe who was honoured by Wits University  recently  with
a posthumous LLD degree. In the same vein, going back in time  were  leaders
like Kwame Nkrumah, Patrice Lumumba, Marcus Garvey, W E D Du Bois,  Senghor,
Nyerere, Sylvester Williams, C L R James, Padmore,  Mnamdi  Azikiwe,  Cheikh
Anta Diop, Mda, Sekou Toure, Modiba Keita, to mention but a few.

Most were demonised, killed and confined to their graves by myopic  nobodies
who imagined that the graves would contain the bodies as well as  the  lofty
ideas of these African giants.

The OAU was a great dream and one of the early fruits to fall from the  tree
of Pan-Africanism. Unfortunately, African leaders were not  fully  dedicated
to this dream and did not give effective leadership to the  continent.  Most
used it as a prestigious social event which they attended  annually,  unless
disturbed by occasional coups in their respective domains.

The revival of this dream today is a blessing which we  should  not  destroy
and let go. We owe it to our children and generations to come to  ruthlessly
dismantle  all  the  vestiges  of  colonial  and  imperial  divide-and-rule,
economic exploitation, social degradation and political fragmentation.

We must work ceaselessly to return Africa to the  Africans,  every  inch  of
it. ``Africans'' should be  understood  in  a  broad,  nonracist,  noncolour
interpretation. [Time expired.]

Ms T E MILLIN: With regard  to  Africa  Day,  the  question  is:  Should  we
celebrate or mourn for our continent? The optimist will always look for  the
silver lining. However, the cold daylight of reality urges  us  to  confront
the many obstacles, the ongoing warfare and atrocities, mass genocide  on  a
massive and largely unchecked scale across many countries to our north.

On our very border is Zimbabwe under its President Mugabe, who  whatever  he
might have been in the past, has become a tyrant of the  first  order  whose
time has come. His beleaguered country, now in  a  desperate  situation  for
which he is chiefly responsible, is floundering under runaway  inflation  of
around 250%. And yet, to quote a recent Mail and Guardian editorial:


  South Africa's approach to the Zim crisis is increasingly becoming one of
  the great mysteries of the modern world.

A recent report stated that  a  Mugabe-orchestrated  Zimbabwe  meltdown  has
cost South Africa and other neighbouring states in excess of $18 billion.

Now Zimbabwe faces another strike or stayaway led  by  the  MDC  which,  God
knows, has every legitimate right and duty  as  the  present  opposition  to
take such a stand against gross human rights  abuses.  The  Zimbabwe  crisis
and the volatility of our exchange rate remain key deterrents  for  would-be
investors in South Africa, as well as concerns  that  land  ownership  might
become an issue in South Africa.

Until Africans, including most importantly we South  Africans  as  the  most
advanced nation in Africa, are prepared to do more than pay lip  service  to
the basic tenets and principles resulting in our historic new  beginning  to
which we committed ourselves on 27 April 1994 - the upliftment of the  poor,
deracialisation of  society,  the  entrenchment  of  democratic  values  and
respect for everybody's human rights, good, but not too  much  governance  -
our dream of a new African Renaissance will evaporate like mist in the  heat
of the African sun. I thank you.

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Madam  Deputy  Speaker  ...  ngiyathokoza.  [Thank
you.]

It was on  18  March  2002  when  women  from  130  countries  assembled  in
Marrakesh, Morocco for the 107th conference of the Interparliamentary  Union
where they called for a pardon for a Nigerian  woman,  Safia  Hussein.  They
said that the IPU had consistently taken a stand against the application  of
the death penalty, and reaffirmed the principle of equality between men  and
women enshrined in international instruments on  human  rights  and  women's
rights.

This principle, which is strongly upheld by the IPU, is the key concept  for
the Beijing Platform for Action that was  adopted  in  1995  by  the  Fourth
World Conference on Women,  and  subsequently  signed  by  the  Republic  of
Nigeria.

``We strongly protest against the death sentence handed down  on  Mrs  Safia
Hussein for adultery and exort the authorities or the  Federal  Republic  of
Nigeria and the state  of  Sokoto  to  grant  her  pardon'',  the  delegates
declared. A month later, Amina Lawal's case came up.

This is not the Africa we are fighting for. These are the practices we  need
to fight against. The reason I  mention  these  sad  stories  is  mainly  to
remind us that as we celebrate 40 years of the OAU, we are still faced  with
these painful situations. We are daily victims of domestic  violence,  rape,
trade trafficking for sexual exploitation by the haves, genital  mutilation,
racial discrimination and xenophobia. These are as a result of the  legacies
of colonisation and apartheid.

These practices, amongst other things, violate  international  human  rights
standards that prohibit the use of torture  in  the  UN  Convention  against
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and  Punishment  and
in the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Addressing the UN Commission on the Status of Women as  it  began  its  47th
session in New York this March, Mr Desai stressed that the commission has  a
special role to play in achieving  gender  equality  and  responsibility  to
develop issues as a whole. He emphasised the link between  the  commission's
work and the work covered by major conferences  such  as  the  Second  World
Assembly  on  Ageing,  the  Monterey  World  Conference  on  Financing   for
Development and the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development.

Echoing Mr Desai's sentiments,  Angela  King,  special  advisor  to  the  UN
Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, on  gender  issues  and  the  advancement  of
women, said that the goals were mutually reinforcing, with progress  towards
one affecting any headway towards the others. The  theme  for  International
Women's Day, gender equality and  millennium  development  goals,  aimed  to
create an awareness of gender equality with respect to all the goals and  to
stress  the  importance  of  gender  dimensions  in   poverty   and   hunger
eradication.

It is obvious that the new century has to bring people back in  the  process
and institutions of democratic governments through the feminisation  of  the
political  space.  Making  our  democracies   increasingly   inclusive   and
generally representative is the basic task for the new century.

Only after bringing back the people, particularly women, will we succeed  in
saving democracy from the forces of  terror.  It  will  also  make  us  more
effective in  eliminating  three  major  challenges  of  our  time:  hunger,
violence and war. All three have devastating effects on every  society,  but
they hurt women and children more.

Mahatma Ghandi in his observation of the then young India in 1918, said:


  Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental  capacities.  She
  has the right to participate in the minute details of activities  of  men
  and she has the same rights of freedom and liberty as he.

By sheer force of a vicious system and custom, even the  most  ignorant  and
worthless of men have been enjoying superiority over women, something  which
they do not deserve and ought not to have.

Women matter in the  affairs  of  human  society.  Our  struggle  for  equal
representation in politics and decision-making is a  response  to  the  most
critical need for creating human social order, free of hunger, violence  and
conflict. With the eradication of poverty as our urgent  task,  we  must  at
the same time advance continuously towards social transformation.

I got the following words from the hon Mrs Tshivhase who heard  that  I  was
going to be talking about war. I quote from Dr Martin Luther King   Jr,  who
reminded us of the darkness ahead when he said:


  Darkness cannot drive out darkness;
  only light can do that.


  Hate cannot drive out hate;
  only love can do that.


  Hate multiplies hate,
  violence multiplies violence and  toughness  multiplies  toughness  in  a
  descending spiral of destruction -


  The chain reaction of evil - hate begetting hate,
  wars producing more wars - must be broken,


  or we shall be plunged
  into the dark abyss of annihilation.

King, like  Ghandi  and  Madiba  and  other  great  activists,  supported  a
nonviolent resistance to oppression. I thank Mrs Tshivhase for these words.

The CEO of the Office on the Status of Women in the  Presidency,  Ms  Nkomo,
reporting to the UN in March this year had this to say about our country:


  Our delegation has the opportunity to engage  with  the  content  of  the
  Secretary-General's reports and welcomes the urgency put  by  the  UN  in
  these critical areas which are important to us, especially as  we  review
  our policies approaching 10 years of freedom and  consider  what  it  has
  meant for all South Africans, particularly women and the girl child.


  With regard to women's human rights and the elimination of all  forms  of
  violence against women and girls, our Constitution guarantees  the  human
  rights and dignity of all persons. In  that  regard,  combating  violence
  against  women  and  children  is  a  priority  for  the  South   African
  Government.

In  December  2002,  South  Africa  ratified  the  UN   Convention   Against
Transnational Organised Crime and the  Protocol  to  Prevent,  Suppress  and
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. This  protocol
supplements  the  UN  conventions  on  children  and  against  transnational
organised crime as well.

Since then, we are proud to announce  that  the  South  African  Government,
through  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,   has
approved the conducting of an investigation into the trafficking of  persons
in January this year. The investigation is accorded a priority ``A''  status
and  is  to  recommend  appropriate  legislation  in   line   with   various
international agreements that South Africa is party  to,  including  the  UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination  of
All Forms of Discrimination Against Women,  and  the  Beijing  Platform  for
Action.

As we celebrate the 40 years of the OAU, we have seen even members  of  this
House come out as shining stars. I want to dedicate the Ndebele  dress  that
I have this afternoon to Comrade, the Minister of Minerals  and  Energy  for
theÿ.ÿ.ÿ. isithwalandwe ... [Praise name] ... that she got from the  Ndebele
people ... ikumbese ... [a blanket] ... to honour her for the role that  she
has played in alleviating the poverty experienced by people, and for  making
sure that SMMEs work in the mining sector. [Applause.]

It is with pride  that  Ndebele  women  wear  that  blanket  when  they  are
honoured, and when I saw Prof Kambule honouring Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka  with
it, I felt that it would be an honour for me to mention that she  is  making
all of us proud.

South Africa, as Chair of the AU, is  involved  at  regional  level  in  the
processes to complete the tax for the additional  protocol  to  the  African
Charter on human and people's rights which addresses the rights of women  in
Africa. This  is  based  on  our  conviction  that  violence  against  women
adversely impacts on our endeavours to realise the  goals  outlined  in  the
Constitutive Act of the AU.

In their book Women,  War  and  Peace,  Elizabeth  Rehn  and  Ellen  Johnson
Sirleaf say:


  As we write this, in the summer of 2002, it is hard to  imagine  a  world
  without war. Every  day,  we  hear  reports  of  new  conflicts  and  old
  grievances, of escalating tension and violence. During  our  missions  to
  conflict situations, we met generations of women and girls who have known
  nothing other than war. Many were gripped by fear and anger;  others  had
  learned to dull their feelings with  a  quality  of  silence  that  often
  follows catastrophe. Having lost so many pieces of their  lives  to  war,
  women shared their experiences with us hoping  that  we  would  make  the
  difference that would  bring  them  some  stability,  some  safety,  some
  shelter or even some food. They hoped that their voices  would  be  heard
  and their triumphs celebrated, that  we  would  showcase,  through  their
  lives, every reason that women must be considered full citizens and  must
  have a stake in deciding their own future - and that finally,  the  world
  would listen.


  We are humbled by our experience over the past year.

The report goes on to say:


  We spent long hours with women who refused to give up hope for peace, and
  who turned to us to make their claims.  How  could  we  possibly  improve
  their lives? In part, the answer will  depend  on  the  seriousness  with
  which the testimony, analysis, hopes and vision  of  these  ordinary  but
  extraordinary women - survivors, leaders, heroines -  are  both  received
  and acted upon.

To this end, we thank the Deputy Speaker and Comrade Thandi Modise,  amongst
others, for ensuring that we interact with this book.


  Women are victims of unbelievably horrific atrocities and  injustices  in
  conflict  situations;  this  is  indisputable.  As  refugees,  internally
  displaced persons, combatants, heads of household and community  leaders,
  as activists  and  peace-builders,  women  and  men  experience  conflict
  differently. Women rarely have  the  same  resources,  political  rights,
  authority or control ...

As Africans, you know that we are peaceful people. This is not  us.  We  are
not violent people. We inherited all this and, as  we  embrace  the  African
century, we must rid ourselves of all this that is not ourselves.

Re tshwanetse go boela kwa boAfrikeng. Re nne MaAfrika a  maloba,  batho  ba
ba ikanyegang, ba ba nang le botho, banna le basadi, basimane  le  basetsana
ba  tlhompho.  A  re  se  dumeleng  gore  rona  re  tla  tshwantshanngwa  le
diphologolo. Botlhokotsebe jo ga bo a tsalwa ke rona. Re tshwanetse gore  re
bo lwantshe gore re kgone  go  ja  monono  wa  kontinente  ya  rona  Afrika.
(Translation of Tswana paragraph follows.)

[We should return to being Africans. We should become Africans of the  past,
people who are trustworthy, who have humanity,  men  and  women,  girls  and
boys of respect. Let us not believe that we can be  compared  with  animals.
We should fight it so as to reap the benefits of our continent, Africa.]

Africa is a vibrant continent with people full  of  laughter  and  song.  We
dance in our countries.  At  times  we  do  so  while  we  sob  through  the
atrocities facing us. We occasionally  hear  the  drumbeat  signalling  some
action taking place. Be it sorrow or fun,  our  African  women  will  arrive
dignified despite poverty and squalor. They will rise to any  occasion  with
pride. That is perhaps what we are celebrating - that we are  survivors  and
we have been survivors. However, as the tables are turning, we are to be  at
the centre of the table to determine our destiny.

Most women on our continent head households. Therefore  they  are  the  best
economists as they are already engaged in  creating  budgets  to  run  these
family units. This contribution may not  always  be  recognised,  but  women
will continue to do good for this continent.  I  always  like  listening  to
Judith Sephuma in times of trials and she will always say, ``I cry, I  smile
and I dance.''

Women had property. They never had to rely  on  anyone  to  bring  up  their
children. When we embraced what was commonly known as Western  civilisation,
we lost all that.

Having said that, I think we need to look at capacity building. We  need  to
rectify a lot of things on our continent so that we can all be proud  as  we
celebrate the many other days that are going to come.

Bongiwe Mlangeni is right to remind us that it is incorrect  to  speak  only
about the famous men of  Africa,  Kwame  Nkrumah,  Julius  Nyerere,  Patrice
Lumumba, Duma Nokwe, Albert  Luthuli,  Nelson  Mandela,  Walter  Sisulu  and
Oliver Tambo. Their role in the formation and in the implementation  of  the
OAU principles is well documented in the books of  history  written  by  men
and women of those times. Yes, there were women in Africa and some  of  them
documented a lot of this history before the 40 years  that  we  are  talking
about.

Bongiwe Mlangeni says, ``Maybe when you are talking about  history  you  are
talking about `his story'.'' Now we  have  to  speak  about  ``her  story''.
[Applause.]

Women kept the stories of Africa and the African literature  intact  through
poetry in literature, Ama Ata Aidoo in Ghana;  Florence  Nwapa  in  Nigeria;
Ransom  Kuti  in  Nigeria;  Maymuna  Kanfal  in  Senegal;  Graca  Machel  in
Mozambique; founder member of the Pan African Woman's Organisation  Adelaide
Tambo; other South African women -  Lillian  Ngoyi,  Helen  Joseph,  Dorothy
Nyembe, Frances Baard, Gertrude Shope,  Winnie  Mandela,  Albertina  Sisulu,
Sister Bernard Ncube, Thandi Modise, Comrade Baleka Kgotsitsile and  others.
[Applause.]
As we celebrate Africa today, we should also not forget  the  ambassador  to
the world that we have in Comrade Nkosozana  Dlamini-Zuma  who  sells  South
Africa and Africa wherever she goes. I want to thank  Bongiwe  Mlangeni  for
reminding the whole of South Africa that there were  women  before  the  men
took their place at the OAU. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: I know of many men who, when they cry, say ``Mama,''.  Very
few say ``Papa.''

Madam Deputy Speaker, in irony or poetic justice let me, on  this  very  day
of the ``Africa Day'' debate, begin by quoting Robert  F.  Kennedy  when  he
said:


  Some people see things and ask why? I dream of things and ask why not?

The African dream, through the mouth and pen of Kenya's Tom Mboya,  realises
that  the  challenges  are  equally  important,  if  not  more,   than   the
celebrations and lavish feasting. He further says:


  Our task should be to examine and to analyse our experience in  order  to
  plan a better path for the future.

Forty years of solidarity in struggle to unity and peace might be  daunting,
but should not arouse despair and immobility. Tom Mboya asserts that:


  ... for those who seek fulfilment, the challenge  of  development  offers
  the most exciting and rewarding experience.

With independence or liberation, a new  phase  in  the  struggle  for  human
nationhood begins. The search for unity must  continue.  The  needs  of  the
people  cannot  wait  either.  Developing  countries,   especially   African
countries, face the challenge of development. The buzz  word  is:  Delivery!
Delivery! Delivery!

The struggle  for  liberation  has  been  very  long  and  very  costly.  In
solidarity, the people's of Africa paid dearly.  The  greatest  and  painful
price has been that of the untold loss of life  and  limb,  sometimes  self-
inflicted in  civil  strife,  the  lust  for  power  and  insatiable  greed,
corruption and bad governance.

Africa has been brutalised and bled to genocidal levels - sadly by  Africans
on Africans. It is indeed pertinent to sound the  refrain  ``Vukani  mawethu
ijala lakuthi. Tsohang litshaba se li litshuhile libone naleli ya meso.''

We laud the concept of Nepad; commendable too is the peer  review  mechanism
and  the  revamped  African  personality  that  we  now  call  the   African
Renaissance. The real litmus test is the implementation - turning the  dream
into reality - without the heady euphoria  that  dangerously  intoxicates  a
short-sighted people. It is not yet ``Uhuru'' until this  positive  mind-set
and ethics are captured and concretised.

The African Union can only succeed if each member does  a  sterling  job  of
governing their respective countries. The  peer  review  mechanism  must  be
perfected and implemented passionately, but very rigorously.  Cover-ups  for
buddies, as though they are a band of Mafioso, should not  be  allowed.  The
Zimbabwe-South-African saga is a case in point. All  members  must  remember
that charity begins at home,  as  the  idiom  goes.  We  cannot  afford  the
razzmatazz when people continue to live in deplorable shacks, are  homeless,
hungry, unemployed and insecure. Let Nero be the last to fiddle whilst  Rome
is burning. I thank you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have  had  forty  years
of history of solidarity in struggle,  solidarity  in  loss,  solidarity  in
belief,  solidarity  in  sacrifice,  solidarity  in  hope,   solidarity   in
liberation and, now, solidarity in freedom.

For all we have achieved today in peace and unity, the question  is  whether
the 40 years of inhumane hardship and suffering were  necessary.  Sadly  and
obviously,  they  were  not.  However,  through  that  hardship,  loss   and
suffering, we are able to appreciate what we have accomplished more and  the
appreciation of our togetherness should live on for many decades to come.

The dreams  of  our  forefathers  is  what  we  live  today.  Their  fights,
struggles, sacrifices, commitments and hardship  were  to  achieve  what  we
have today. The MF takes this  opportunity  to  commemorate  all  those  who
sacrificed their lives for the liberation of  their  people.  The  hon  late
Mahatma Ghandi, our own hon Nelson Mandela, the hon late Walter  Sisulu  and
many, many others, we salute you in honour of your  commitment  to  what  we
have today.

Our national Constitution is  our  Bible  to  peace  and  unity.  Overseeing
democratic government and the Bill of Rights,  our  Constitution  bears  the
pact of the South African  citizenry  to  be  one  people,  no  matter  what
colour, race or creed. The MF is pleased to note the liberation of  minority
Indians throughout South Africa and celebrates the  freedom  and  liberation
we all had been previously robbed of.

What is important is that, unlike previous years where  government  and  its
people operated on opposite sides of the fence,  today  Government  and  its
people work on the same side, hand-in-hand. I guess that is what makes us  a
government by the people, for the people. It allows for our people to  voice
not only their likes and dislikes, but their needs and wants  too,  enabling
better governance.

The MF calls for greater unity between the  Government  and  the  community.
The MF commemorates our 40 years of  struggle  in  solidarity  and  supports
unity and peace. Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy  Speaker,  Africa  Day  -  40  years.  Forty  years,
exactly the time it took Moses to lead the Israelites through the desert  to
the promised land. A pity he did not know about the  National  Action,  then
it would have taken him only fourteen days!

The question is, Deputy Speaker, after 40 years of OAU and the birth of  the
AU, are we witnessing the end of  the  desert  journey  of  Africa?  Are  we
crossing the River Jordan to a promised land for Africa? When you cross  the
Limpopo, it definitely does not look so.

Die Nasionale Aksie se leuse is: Jou toekoms is hier.  En  ``hier''  beteken
Suid-Afrika en ``hier''  beteken  Afrika.  Daarom  steun  die  NA  die  nuwe
inisiatief vir Afrika se ontwikkeling en sê ons ook  ons  is  ``van  hier.''
Die vraag is egter wat word in alle kringe bedoel met 'n Afrika-lojaliteit?

Onlangs sit ek in 'n vliegtuig langs 'n hoogs professionele  swart  man,  op
intieme voet met hoë regeringslui. Aanvanklik het hy baie  gematig  geklink,
maar soos die Romeine sê: In vino veritas.

En na die derde halfbotteltjie raak die man regtig aan die praat  en  hy  sê
vir my: ``We are 800 million blacks in Africa, you are only five.  You  will
have to become black if you want to survive.''

Ek vryf so oor my hand en sê: ``Hoe de hoenders gaan ek dit  regkry?'';  toe
antwoord hy: ``No, you must become black in your heart.''

Geagte Adjunkspeaker, is dit nie dalk wat baie keer bedoel  word  met  ``the
dawn of the African century'' nie? Die vraag is, is ek ook deel daarvan  met
behoud van 'n eie kultuur,  eie  lewenswyse  en  eie  manier  van  dink  wat
dikwels anders is as die 800 miljoen? Met 'n eie trots  in  my  geskiedenis,
prestasies, foute en al van my mense, gaan Afrika die  formule  vind  om  'n
werklike tuiste te wees en te bied vir al sy mense, mense  wat  ook  verknog
is aan hierdie aarde, maar op 'n eie unieke manier, sonder dat hulle in  hul
hart iets anders hoef te word?

Dít gaan bepaal of die komende 40 jaar steeds 'n woestynreis  gaan  wees  of
nie. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The National Action's motto is: Your future is  here.  And  ``here''  means
South Africa and ``here'' means Africa. Therefore the NA  supports  the  new
initiative for Africa's development and we also say we  are  ``from  here''.
However, the question is what is meant in all circles by African loyalty?

Recently I sat in an aeroplane next to a highly professional black  man  who
is on an intimate footing with prominent people in Government. Initially  he
sounded very moderate, but as the Romans would say: In vino veritas.

And after the third halfjack the man really became talkative and he said  to
me: ``We are 800 million blacks in Africa, you are only five. You will  have
to become black if you want to survive.''

I ran my one hand over the other and said: How the dickens will I manage  to
do that?''. Than he answered: ``No, you must become black in your heart''.

Hon Deputy Speaker, is this not what is often meant by  ``the  dawn  of  the
African century?''  The  question  is:  Am  I  also  a  part  of  it,  while
preserving an own culture, own way of life and own way  of  thinking,  which
is often different from that of the 800 million? With an  own  pride  in  my
history, achievements, mistakes and all of my people, will Africa  find  the
formula to be and offer a real home to all its people,  people who are  also
attached to this earth, but in their  own  unique  way,  without  having  to
become something else in their hearts?

This will determine if the next 40 years will still  be  a  journey  through
the desert or not. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Deputy Speaker, I have no doubt that the last  40  years
of African history will be recorded and remembered as the era  during  which
Africans managed to throw off the shackles of colonial control and rule.

So we enter  this  era  with  53  independent  sovereign  states  -  a  very
substantial achievement - for which those who have struggled for it  for  so
long deserve recognition and credit. But now, of course, we must look  ahead
to the new challenges which face us, and we should be under no illusions  as
to the magnitude of these challenges.

Yes, there are 53 sovereign, independent states, but  democracy  is  patchy;
many governments are pitifully weak and, at times, human rights  are  simply
ignored. Then there are the problems of poverty, of Aids, of ignorance,  the
lack of economic development, of skills and managerial resources, of  infant
mortality, gender inequality and the  marginalisation  of  Africa  from  the
globalisation of the world economy.

To deal with these challenges, Africa has fashioned two instruments: One  is
the African Union,  a  structure;  the  second  is  Nepad,  a  developmental
programme. I am as impressed by the objectives of the AU as I am excited  by
the prospects of Nepad.

However, based on my experiences of Africa over the past year,  I  have  two
major concerns: One is in respect of Nepad, and that  is  of  a  wide-spread
lack of knowledge and understanding of the nature  and  the  functioning  of
Nepad. At conferences, one finds varied reactions, from  qualified  approval
to misunderstandings, to ignorance, to misconception, to skepticism  and  to
hostility, not  only  from  elements  of  civil  society,  but  indeed  from
politicians and government leaders who, in fact,  should  be  promoting  and
leading the Nepad process.

I suggest that this is a matter of serious concern for the  leaders  of  the
Nepad implementation committee and  the  secretariat,  because  unless  they
give the lead explaining exactly what this is all about, you  are  going  to
get 53 different interpretations of Nepad across the African continent.

The second concern is the depth of commitment to Nepad: How deep  is  it?  I
am concerned that, of the 53 countries that signed  the  Nepad  declaration,
only 11 of them have in fact agreed to the peer review mechanism.

This does not inspire confidence in commitment. And, yet,  at  the  core  of
Nepad is a commitment; it is  based  on  a  commitment  by  African  leaders
themselves to do something for Africa. And that  has  to  be  expanded,  not
only from African leaders, it has to be expanded to the  people  of  Africa.
It cannot be a process that is led only from the top. It has  to  come  from
the people, it has to come from all sectors of society. It is not  going  to
come to us like manna from heaven or from Addis  Ababa.  It  has  to  happen
right out here in our towns, our cities, and in our communities. It  has  to
happen around Africa.

I believe that if there is the commitment and the will to  see  it  through,
Nepad can succeed. Unless there is that commitment,  unless  there  is  this
will, we can carry on making speeches in Parliament to  no  avail.  However,
if we have that commitment, if we have that will around Africa, we  will  in
fact really have a new era of peace and development in  Africa.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members,  during  the  last  decade
but one of the previous century, a British scholar,  Martin  Bernal,  caused
an academic stir in Western universities by publishing a book  titled  Black
Athena,  suggesting  that  the  origins  of  Greek  and   ancient   European
civilisation lay in Africa and Asia.

The academic heat generated by Bernal's thesis made it evident that to  most
Europeans, even those schooled in the best  universities,  the  notion  that
the Greeks owed  anything  to  Africa  was  unpalatable.  I  am  neither  an
advocate of Martin Bernal's views, nor  an  opponent  of  his  thesis  whose
merits  and  demerits  I'm  ill-equipped  to  judge,  but  the  chagrin   he
occasioned amongst his interlocutors  suggested  that  what  was  really  at
stake was not ancient history but, rather, 20th century politics.

In their enthusiasm to refute Bernal, many a reckless statement was  uttered
and published. In the midst of that controversy, Bernal  produced  a  second
volume of Black Athena, marshalling further  arguments  in  support  of  his
original thesis. The academic controversy continues and promises to be  long
and protracted. Whether we will be any the wiser when it  ends,  remains  to
be seen.

African scholars have argued that our continent descended into its own  Dark
Ages after an initial period  of  immense  creativity  and  initiative.  The
commencement of the transatlantic  slave  trade,  followed  by  the  era  of
colonialism and apartheid, deepened Africa's degradation. However,  we  have
now arrived at a point at  which  the  continued  depiction  of  Africa  and
Africans as victims is not only self-defeating, but also disempowering.

We Africans - black, brown, white, kinky-haired or  straight-haired  -  have
to  rise  to  the  challenges  facing  us  by  assuming  responsibility  for
ourselves, our continent and its future. There  is  a  Xhosa  proverb  which
says that a flock without lambs has no  future.  It  was  therefore  with  a
great sense of pride that  we  received  the  news  of  the  achievement  of
Sibusiso Vilane, the first black South African person to  reach  the  summit
of Mount Everest on Monday, 26 May 2003.

The courage, perseverance and sheer effort that this  feat  involved  is  an
inspiration to us all. We would like  to  believe  that  it  epitomises  the
spirit that  imbues  the  young  people  of  our  country  and  the  African
continent. With people like Sibusiso amongst us, there is no  reason  to  be
fearful for the future of Africa.

As we marked Africa Day on 25 May, the spirit of Pan-African solidarity  was
being given palpable and practical expression by a  team  of  South  African
rescue workers sent to Algeria to assist the citizens of  a  sister  African
country at the other end of our continent. Our hearts go out to  the  people
of Algeria at this moment of deep bereavement.  However,  while  we  express
our condolences and offer comfort to the grieving families and the  Algerian
nation, we are also in the fortunate position to give  practical  assistance
to save lives and to help rebuild.

Africa Day celebrates the struggles of  the  people  of  this  continent  to
reclaim their birthright of freedom and their inalienable  right  to  govern
themselves. As we cast  our  eyes  back  over  the  long  road  of  Africa's
struggle for liberation, a number of interesting milestones catch our eyes.
The year 1853 marks the end of the Kat River Rebellion, the first  authentic
war of independence waged on South African soil.  It  was  very  similar  in
scope, and in the profile of the  protagonists,  to  India's  First  War  of
Independence, the so-called Indian Mutiny of 1857.

In 1851 coloured ex-soldiers of the militarised  Kat  River  settlement  who
had served as  frontier  guards  for  the  Cape  Colony  along  the  eastern
frontier  after  1819,  rose  in  rebellion,  demanding  freedom  and  self-
government. Contrary to P W Botha's oft-repeated claim, it is  the  coloured
people of the Eastern Cape, and not the Afrikaners, who  can  lay  claim  to
being the pioneers of the movement for independence in Southern Africa.

A second milestone is 1903,  when  Adv  H  S  Williams,  a  Trinidadian-born
barrister, inspired the convening of  a  meeting  in  Cape  Town  where  the
African People's Organisation, the APO, a  national  political  organisation
of coloured people to strive for equal rights for all  South  Africans,  was
launched.  That  same  year  in  Natal,  John  L  Dube  founded  the   first
independent African language newspaper in Natal, Ilanga laseNatal.  Also  in
1903 Mohandas Gandhi founded a newspaper called  Indian  Opinion,  targeting
the Indian community.

This year, 2003, marks the centenary of all three of these  initiatives.  It
would be very appropriate for South Africa to find  some  way  in  which  to
celebrate them. This year is  also  the  60th  anniversary  of  The  African
Claims, adopted by the ANC's national conference on 16 December 1943,  as  a
considered response to the Atlantic  Charter  pronounced  by  Roosevelt  and
Churchill two years earlier off the coast of Newfoundland.  With  hindsight,
a human rights scholar has  characterised  The  African  Claims  as  a  very
precocious document in that it anticipated the  1948  Universal  Declaration
of Human Rights.

Permit me, Madam Deputy Speaker, to quote at some length from  its  preface,
written by Dr A B Xuma, the convenor of the committee  that  drafted  it.  I
quote:


  The soldiers of all races Europeans,  Americans,  Asiatics  and  Africans
  have won their claim and the claims of their peoples to the four freedoms
  by having taken part in this war which can be converted into  a  war  for
  human freedom if the settlement at the Peace  Table  is  based  on  human
  justice, fair play and equality of opportunity for all races, colours and
  classes.

The document continues.


  As African leaders we are not so foolish as to believe  that  because  we
  have made these declarations that our government will grant us our claims
  for the mere asking. We realise that for the African  this  is  only  the
  beginning of a long struggle entailing great sacrifices  of  them,  means
  and even life  itself.  To  the  African  people  the  declaration  is  a
  challenge to organise and unite  themselves  under  the  mass  liberation
  movement, the African National Congress. The struggle is on right now and
  it must be persistent and insistent. In a mass liberation movement  there
  is no room for divisions or for personal  ambitions.  The  goal  is  one,
  namely, freedom for all. It  should  be  the  central  and  only  aim  or
  objective of all true African nationals. Divisions and  gratification  of
  personal ambitions under the circumstances will be  a  betrayal  of  this
  great cause.

In the afterword of an edition of The African Claims published in  1946,  we
learn that Dr Xuma had in fact submitted this  document  to  South  Africa's
wartime prime minister, Gen Jan Christiaan Smuts, with a view to  having  it
discussed. However, he was rudely rebuffed with the response that the  prime
minister  ``was  not  prepared  to  discuss  proposals  which   are   wildly
impracticable.

The year 1943 was also the year in which the 31-year-old Walter  Sisulu  and
his colleagues launched the ANC Youth League, which  was  to  transform  the
ANC from a body of gentlemen with  clean  hands  into  the  mass  liberation
movement envisaged in The African Claims.

We  recall  these  milestones  because  they  are  emblematic  of  the  many
opportunities South Africa and the African  continent  have  lost,  all  too
often because of the short-sightedness of those at the helm.  The  political
values set out in The African  Claims  remain  extremely  relevant  for  the
project of an African Renaissance and Nepad.

Viewed from  that  perspective  these  principles  which  are  so  eminently
achievable,  could  be  the  key  to  Africa's  success.  Reduced  to  their
essentials, they are: firstly, that  all  governments  should  derive  their
authority from the consent of the governed; secondly, no person or group  of
persons should be subjected to oppression or domination by virtue of his  or
her race, gender, colour or religious  belief;  three,  all  persons  should
enjoy security in their  persons  and  their  goods  against  intrusions  by
secular or clerical authorities; four, all persons should  enjoy  the  right
to life, unfettered  by  the  impositions  of  either  secular  or  clerical
authorities; five, all persons should have the untrammelled  right  to  hold
and express whatever opinions they wish to subscribe  to,  as  long  as  the
exercise of that right does not infringe on the rights of others;  six,  all
persons should be equal before the law - no one should  enjoy  a  privileged
status  separate  and  above  others;   seven,   the   state   must   assume
responsibility for the wellbeing of the  citizen  by  the  provision  of  an
adequate system of education and training,  health  care  and  an  expanding
floor of rights to sustain and maintain the human dignity of all citizens.

These social  rights,  contained  in  The  African  Claims,  spelt  out  and
anticipated many of the social rights we have enshrined  in  the  democratic
Constitution South Africa adopted in 1996.

Our efforts to renew the African continent arrive at  a  time  when  African
countries  are  restoring  democratic  governance.  An  African  Renaissance
without popular participation and accountable governments is  inconceivable.
That implies regular, free and fair  multiparty  elections  to  ensure  that
governments remain sensitive and responsive to the views and aspirations  of
ordinary citizens, and that this must become  a  political  norm  throughout
the country. The challenge we face in  Africa  today  is  the  pursuance  of
rapid economic growth and development in tandem with democratic norms.

The fourth milestone is 1973, which witnessed the revival  of  a  democratic
trade union movement in  our  country,  announced  by  strikes  amongst  the
African workers in Durban  and  KwaZulu-Natal.  The  strikes  of  that  year
signalled the unfreezing of the political landscape that  had  followed  the
massive repression of the post-Rivonia period.  The  mobilisation  of  black
working people gathered momentum over the next 10 years, culminating in  the
establishment of Cosatu in 1984.

The trade union movement comprises the largest  single  component  of  South
Africa's civil society, with in  excess  of  3 million  members  distributed
amongst a number of affiliates. It  is  universally  recognised  today  that
civil society  is  a  vital  constituent  of  any  democratic  dispensation,
providing, as it does, the ordinary citizen the political  space  to  engage
with both the state and society at large around the complexities of life  in
our modern industrial societies.

South Africa's economic  future  is  also  very  integrally  linked  to  the
fortunes of our  continent.  Nepad  and  the  regeneration  of  the  African
continent should therefore be seen as  of  much  concern  to  South  African
business as they are for the Government. A  host  of  opportunities  on  the
African continent beckon, provided our businesspeople have the  courage  and
commitment to explore them.

The infrastructure of Africa sorely needs to  be  developed.  It  is  ironic
that it is Africa's ports that take African-produced  goods  away  from  the
continent that seem to work at some level  of  efficiency,  yet  the  intra-
African trade systems and networks are either nonexistent or are  threatened
with decay.

Stimulating co-operation and mutually beneficial economic relations  amongst
African countries requires  that  we  ensure  that  the  existing  transport
networks are functional and that new sustainable  ones  are  built.  African
telecommunications will also have to be greatly expanded to rapidly  improve
intra-African communications which  are  indispensable  to  the  continent's
renewal.

The inherited patterns of communication and trade,  established  during  the
colonial era, often frustrate and inhibit our  own  potential.  Africa  must
now strive to exert greater control over its resources through  multilateral
co-operation  agreements  amongst  African  countries,   while   discovering
mutually beneficial  arrangements  with  other  regions  of  the  developing
world. Economic co-operation with other developing countries, supported  and
supplemented by strategic alliances to  create  synergies  amongst  us,  can
only lend strength to such efforts.

We must also be unsparing and rigorous in our introspection.  We  must  have
the courage to face up to the reality that Africa's  millions  are  held  in
thrall, not only by poverty, but also by appalling levels of ignorance  that
compound the continent's economic and social problems.
A meaningful cultural revival demands a critical  revisiting  of  indigenous
African culture, African institutions, African  customs,  African  practices
and mores.  Sexism,  ethnicity,  tribalism  and  cronyism  are  amongst  the
indigenous ills Africans must confront if our continent is to be renewed.

The single biggest  threat  to  Africa's  economic  growth  are  preventable
diseases. The HIV/Aids pandemic has already wreaked  untold  damage  on  the
economically active population of the continent and, unless arrested,  could
pose a threat to future generations as well.  Malaria  remains  the  biggest
killer of African children, and the reappearance of  tuberculosis,  when  we
all thought it had been contained, points to the serious  challenges  facing
the African people.

The poor health suffered by many on our continent is  directly  attributable
to the premodern conditions  in  which  many  Africans  have  to  live.  The
unavailability  of  clean  water,  the  absence  of  proper  sanitation  and
inadequate shelter conspire to render the health of  far  too  many  on  the
continent precarious.

Political stability and peace are the preconditions for the regeneration  of
the African continent. Since 1994 our Government has been at  the  forefront
of efforts to achieve these, not by imposing a Pax South Africana  by  force
of arms, but by judicious interventions.

We have nudged African  countries  in  desirable  directions.  Our  role  in
Lesotho and the Great Lakes region, the role we are playing in the  DRC  and
the role we are playing in bringing the parties to  the  political  conflict
in Zimbabwe to the conference table attest to South Africa's  commitment  to
peace. We still have to persuade a critical mass of African politicians  and
other players to eschew zero-sum  politics.  Our  continent  stands  at  the
threshold of a new era, and it is  up  to  us  to  ensure  that  it  becomes
Africa's rendezvous with her destiny.

In 1906 a South African undergraduate at the  University  of  Columbia,  New
York, wrote, inter alia, and I quote:


  The regeneration of Africa means that a new and  unique  civilisation  is
  soon to be added to the world. The African is not a  proletarian  in  the
  world of science and art. He has precious creations of his own, of ivory,
  of copper and of gold, fine, plated willow-ware and weapons  of  superior
  workmanship. Civilisation resembles an organic being in its development -
  it is born, it perishes, and it can propagate itself. More  particularly,
  it resembles a plant, it takes root in the teeming earth,  and  when  the
  seeds fall in other soils new varieties sprout  up.  The  most  essential
  departure of this  new  civilisation  is  that  it  shall  be  thoroughly
  spiritual and humanistic - indeed a regeneration moral and eternal!


  O Africa!


  Like some great century plant that shall bloom
  In ages hence, we watch thee; in our dream
  See in thy swamps the Prospero of our stream;
  Thy doors unlocked, where knowledge in her tomb
  Hath lain innumerable years in gloom.
  Then shalt thou, walking with that morning gleam,
  Shine as thy sister lands with equal beam.

Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL
                  GOVERNMENT - STUDY TOUR OF MUNICIPALITIES

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  comrades,  friends,  the  hon  Pallo
Jordan points out that he didn't  use  his  full  20  minutes,  and  he  has
therefore very kindly given me his two remaining minutes. I  hope  that  the
Deputy Speaker will take that into account.

I present this report with great pleasure for adoption in  this  House.  The
portfolio committee, as many of you might know, undertook a  study  tour  of
municipalities from 20 to 30 January.

Three multiparty teams of five MPs each visited  three  provinces  each.  In
all we covered 63 municipalities, three metro sub-councils, seven  MECs  and
provincial departments, four ward  committees  and  public  meetings,  three
urban and rural nodes, and  three  Planning  and  Implementation  Management
Centres. In all we interacted with over 2 200 people.

We were rather surprised at how seriously the study tour was  taken  by  the
municipalities. Most of them prepared fully for it, with  some  even  having
preparatory workshops and meetings. We were certainly very  enthusiastically
received. Partly, we think, this is  because  municipalities  are  desperate
for support, but it also perhaps reflects the inadequate relationship we  as
MPs and MPLs have with the municipalities  we  live  in  and  in  which  our
constituencies  are.  Perhaps  we  are  not   doing   enough   through   our
constituency work to consolidate and advance the implementation of  the  new
local government system.

It was a very successful tour indeed. However,  ultimately  the  success  of
the study tour will be  measured  by  the  extent  to  which  our  portfolio
committee addresses the key  concerns  raised  by  the  municipalities,  and
reports back to them. As part of this, we published a  full  report  in  the
ATC of 13 May. We also produced 5 000 copies of a special  printed  version.
Many of you have it here on your desks, and we will have, by  this  weekend,
distributed all of them. I will briefly offer an overview of the report  and
focus on some aspects of the way forward. Other  members  of  our  portfolio
committee will focus on different aspects of the report.

What emerges very clearly from the study tour is that the  core  principles,
values and features of the new local government system are sound, but  there
needs to be greater understanding amongst all the key  stakeholders  of  the
need for the two-tier system of the local government  made  up  of  district
and local municipalities. Fundamentally, the challenges of  the  new  system
are  not  around  conceptual  and  policy  issues,  but   in   fact   around
implementation issues.

It is about plans, strategies,  programmes,  funding  and  other  resources,
quality of leadership, capacity-building and training, and the practical co-
operation of all three  spheres  of  government.  There  has  been  constant
ongoing change in local government for the past ten years and more. In  many
municipalities a significant number of new  councillors  came  in  with  the
December 2000 elections. Officials are constantly changing.  Overall,  there
is a certain measure of transformation fatigue. A measure of  stability  has
to be introduced, we argue.

Given the magnitude of the local government transformation,  there  will  be
ongoing change. However, precisely to ensure the success of this, a  measure
of stability is necessary. Most municipalities have a core of officials  and
councillors who have a very good grasp of the  challenges  before  them  and
are committed to addressing these. The gap between this advanced  elite  and
the average councillor and official  is  great,  and  needs  to  be  reduced
through capacity-building and training.

There  is  also  an  urgent  need  to  improve  management   and   practical
implementation skills of councillors and officials so that they make  better
use of limited resources, and more  effectively  convert  plans,  programmes
and  strategies  into   concrete   delivery   and   development.   The   new
municipalities have progressed reasonably well in merging several  different
pre-existing municipalities. Single administrations and  budgets  have  been
effected with hardly any disruption of service delivery.

However, the new administrations need to be more developmental.  There  also
needs to be more co-operation and a  more  productive  relationship  between
councillors  and  officials.  Relations  between  the  district  and   local
municipalities  vary  from  cordial  and  co-operative  to  conflictual  and
unproductive.  There  needs  to  be  much  more  work  done  to  effectively
implement the two-tier system of local government. National  and  provincial
Government, Salga and other role-players will  have  to  offer  considerable
support to municipalities to  effectively  implement  the  new  division  of
powers and functions between district  and  local  municipalities,  to  come
into effect on 1 July.

Municipalities are certainly aware  that  IDPs  generally  are  not  of  the
required  quality,  but  the  notion  of  development  planning   has   been
internalised   by   municipalities.   However,   provincial   and   national
departments tend to  ignore  IDPs.  If  they  have  reservations  about  the
quality of the IDPs, we argue that they must contribute to  improving  them.
Provinces need to consider new provincial development plans that are  shaped
by and also shape municipal IDPs. It is vital that there is more  integrated
government.

For significant improvement in service delivery and development,  there  has
to be more co-operation  and  co-ordination  across  the  three  spheres  of
government. Financial issues  certainly  constitute  the  biggest  challenge
confronting municipalities. Municipalities have to make far  more  effective
use of limited resources. They also have to do far more to collect the  debt
owed to them, and to raise more of their own revenue. A significant part  of
the  arrears  indeed  is  owed  by  the  private   sector   and   government
departments.

National and provincial Government have to assist municipalities to  recover
moneys owed to them by government departments  for  service  charges,  rates
and agency functions. Of course, the answer to financial difficulties  being
experienced by municipalities does not lie in flinging more money  at  them.
It is clear, however, that there is  a  need  for  a  new  local  government
financial system that is appropriate for  the  new  developmental  model  of
local government.

While the case for increases in the remuneration of some councillors is  not
sound, in the case of others it certainly is. There needs to be a much  more
open and informed debate about what the possibilities and limits are of  any
increases. Municipalities that  have  a  very  weak  rates  base  need  more
financial  support  from  the  national  Government  to  meet  the  cost  of
councillors' remuneration. However, over time, careful consideration has  to
be given, within budgetary constraints, to the  national  fiscus  meeting  a
significant part of the cost of councillors' pay.

The Minister's guidelines on  the  remuneration  of  municipal  managers  is
welcomed. If it is constitutionally  possible,  the  Minister  should  issue
regulations instead and, if  necessary,  legislative  amendments  should  be
effected to allow  him  to  do  so.  While  the  considerable  potential  of
community participation in the new  local  government  system  is  far  from
developed, there has been reasonable progress. There is a need, however,  to
ensure greater and more  consistent  community  participation,  particularly
through ward committees.

Significant progress has been  achieved  in  the  provision  of  free  basic
services, especially water.  It  is  vital,  however,  that  a  much  higher
proportion of people living in rural areas, and who are often those most  in
need, receive the  free  basic  water  services.  The  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry's handing over of full responsibility for the  delivery
of water to municipalities must  be  phased  in  sensitively  and  sensibly,
taking into account financial capacity and  other  considerations  affecting
each municipality. Failure to do  so  could  seriously  undermine  the  free
basic water programme.

There is an urgent need, moreover, to review capacity-building and  training
programmes for both councillors and officials, and  to  drastically  improve
them. More effective co-operation among the relevant  service  providers  is
crucially  necessary.  Some  municipalities,  without   the   most   minimal
financial, economic, revenue or other base, are simply  not  viable,  unless
drastic measures are taken, not just by the  municipalities  concerned,  but
by provincial and national Government, the private sector,  communities  and
other stakeholders.

Of course, fundamental changes to municipal boundaries should be  approached
cautiously. Boundary issues, moreover, should  not  be  conflated  with  the
many other  issues  affecting  the  viability  of  municipalities,  but  the
Municipal Demarcation Board might well have to reconsider the boundaries  of
these  municipalities.  The  quality  of  leadership  in   a   municipality,
especially  that  of  councillors,  but   also   officials   and   community
representatives, signally influences its effectiveness, notwithstanding  the
constraints of funds and resources, and the magnitude of the challenges.

It is clear that, unless municipalities  get  more  resources  and  increase
service delivery, the new local government system will  not  be  effectively
implemented. At the same time, unless the new  local  government  system  is
more effectively implemented, municipalities will  not  be  able  to  secure
more resources and significantly increase delivery. In short,  what  we  are
saying  is  that  municipalities  are  in  the  early  stages  of  a   major
transformation to a fundamentally new system of local government. With  huge
challenges and limited resources and capacity, municipalities are  certainly
making more progress than is commonly made  out,  even  if  less  than  they
should.

However, together with national and  provincial  Government  and  other  key
role-players, they have to be significantly more  effective.  The  portfolio
committee has made various proposals in the report on action  to  be  taken.
We have engaged with the Minister,  but  unfortunately  and  regrettably  he
couldn't be here today, but the Deputy Minister is going to respond  to  our
report. The D-G and other senior officials are  here.  We  will  shortly  be
meeting with them again to discuss a programme based on this and will,  over
time, actively monitor developments in this regard.

The Department of Provincial and Local Government,  we  are  clear,  on  its
own, cannot address the many issues raised in  our  report.  Other  national
departments,  provincial  departments  of  local   government,   and   other
provincial departments, Salga, community organisations,  trade  unions,  the
private sector and other stakeholders have a crucial role to play  as  well.
So too do Parliament and the legislatures, and in particular  our  portfolio
committee. We have also published this report on several websites to  engage
in discussion around it. We are clear that municipalities also  have  to  do
more for themselves.

There will be briefings on the report with our  respective  party  caucuses,
various Ministries and national  departments,  Salga,  MECs  and  provincial
departments, trade unions, traditional leaders and  other  structures,  some
of which have already begun. We are also  pursuing,  I  must  stress  before
this House, the possibility of securing a researcher  for  six  months,  who
would follow up on the issues raised during the  study  tour,  and  keep  in
touch with the relevant municipalities and inform them of developments.  The
researcher could also assist with our monitoring and oversight functions  in
regard to the issues for action raised in our report.

We are also exploring the possibility, and I hope the Deputy  Speaker  notes
this  in  particular,  with  the  relevant  authorities  in  Parliament,  of
allocating a week of constituency work to local  government.  Ideally,  this
should involve all MPs from both Houses taking part, and should  take  place
in the second half of this year. We must effectively  fulfil  our  oversight
functions with regard to proposals for action  in  this  report.  Obviously,
what and how much we can do to  take  forward  the  issues  raised  in  this
report depends on a very wide range of factors.

Among  these  are,  obviously,  our  legislative  and  other   parliamentary
responsibilities,   constituency   work,   political   party    deployments,
availability of research, technical and other resources,  funding,  and  the
co-operation of a wide range of stakeholders. Aspects of the  programme  set
out may not be realisable, but whatever  we  can  do,  we  should  certainly
actively seek to do. We should also, in other words, monitor ourselves.

By way of conclusion, we want to note  our  sincerest  appreciation  to  the
municipalities and other  stakeholders  for  the  considerable  co-operation
they  accorded  us,  and  the  very  warm  reception  they  gave   us.   The
organisational  details  were  dealt  with  by  our  outstanding   committee
secretary, Mr Llewellyn Brown, who can't be here yet again,  because  he  is
busy doing a whole lot of work related to our portfolio committee.  We  want
to acknowledge our sincerest appreciation to him. Our thanks also go  to  Ms
Pinkie de Villiers of the Municipal Demarcation Board, and the  researchers,
Mr Sibanyoni, Mr Liebenberg, and Mr  Dingela,  for  the  background  reports
they did, which helped us to draft this final report.

I have pleasure, therefore, in recommending  this  report  for  adoption  in
this House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G A J GROBLER: Madam Deputy Speaker, I don't  know.  I  didn't  copy  his
speech, but it was quite a good one, Yunus.

The undertaking of a tour of this magnitude by  so  many  committee  members
deserves appreciation. It was most informative and worth every  effort,  and
I must congratulate the committee chairperson for  the  role  he  played  in
organising this study tour. Also, as he has already said, a word  of  thanks
goes to Llewellyn Brown; easily one of the best committee  secretaries  that
I've ever worked with.

This fact-finding mission  was  necessary.  Not  only  did  we  come  across
success stories, but  we  were  also  exposed  to  municipalities  that  are
experiencing serious problems. An  eye-opener  for  me  personally  was  the
openness of councillors and officials regarding the specific  problems  that
they are experiencing in their various municipalities.  The  DA  would  also
like to express its gratitude to  all  the  councillors  and  officials  for
their hospitality during our visit, and also to  those  persons  responsible
for this report. As I have said, there are success stories,  but  there  are
also cries for help, both from officials and councillors.

Issues of concern for the DA are of course, firstly, executive  mayors.  The
DA feels that the existing local government system allows too much power  to
the executive mayor and mayoral committees. Where these  systems  do  exist,
the DA calls for these executive mayoral committee meetings to be more  open
to the public for more transparency. Smaller municipalities can  do  without
this executive mayoral system. I don't see why not.

I now come to my favourite topic,  district  municipalities.  The  necessity
for district municipalities remains questionable. Municipalities  also  said
that they get very little service,  and  in  most  cases,  no  service  from
district municipalities. There were many such examples, not exceptions.  The
DA firmly believes that this two-tier  system  is  unnecessary.  It  is  too
costly and definitely not viable.

These district municipalities are, to say the least, a  waste  of  rate  and
taxpayers' money. Some district municipalities immediately spent  the  first
moneys they received from central Government on lavish offices  and  mayoral
cars, and in some instances, even on cars for their speakers.

An HON MEMBER: And their members!

Mr G A J GROBLER: You are so right!

District municipalities have also  delegated  most  of  their  functions  to
category B municipalities in their areas. Meetings have been scaled down  to
the absolute legal minimum. For now,  district  municipalities  should  have
minimal powers and functions, as far I'm concerned, and,  also,  as  far  as
the DA is concerned, district municipalities should be phased  out  as  soon
as possible. My question to the Deputy Minister - it's a pity  the  Minister
is not here - is: What is the use of having these  district  municipalities?
I wish somebody would give me an answer.

I now  come  to  provincial  governments.  Many  municipalities  are  having
serious problems with their provincial governments. Provincial  governments'
constant failure to pay municipalities for  services  rendered  is  a  major
problem. Services such as the agency functions which we've heard  about  are
fulfilled  by  these  municipalities   on   behalf   of   their   provincial
governments, but they  are  not  paid  for  doing  that.  Municipalities  in
certain cases bear the administrative costs of housing  deliveries,  a  cost
which is quite substantial for most municipalities.

Moneys owed to two municipalities amount  to  R24 million  and  R150 million
respectively. One municipality mentioned that amounts owed by  the  national
and provincial  Governments  in  total  amounted  to  R400 million.  If  hon
members guessed which province it was, and if you  said  Eastern  Cape,  you
would be absolutely correct. The champion of nonperforming  provinces!  This
is not only unacceptable, it is a disgrace.

Hierdie feite wat die DA vandag hier voorhou, is  nie  uit  my  duim  gesuig
nie. Dit is die feitelike inligting wat aan ons komiteelede gegee is in  die
feitesending wat meegemaak is. U  kan  dit  lees  in  daardie  brosjure  wat
uitgegee is. Daar lê dus 'n groot uitdaging voor, en die  DA  is  bereid  om
die Regering te help om van munisipaliteite 'n sukses te maak.  Al  wat  die
ANC-Nuwe NP-alliansie moet doen, is om na  die  suksesverhale  van  die  DA-
beheerde munisipaliteite te kyk. Dis so maklik soos dit!

Ons stem egter saam dat dit immers die regeringsvlak naaste  aan  die  mense
is, en ons is dit almal eens dat ons 'n sukses daarvan moet maak.  Ons  móét
'n sukses daarvan maak, maar daar sal dan meer aandag gegee  moet  word  aan
opleiding. Ek dink my kollega gaan meer daaroor praat. Daar sal ook  ernstig
gekyk moet word na die kwaliteit van amptenare, soos  ons  ook  gehoor  het,
wat aangestel word. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Daar kan gerus ook gekyk word na  die  astronomiese  salarisse  wat  sommige
amptenare verdien. Ek bedoel,  minister  Manuel  het  reeds  verwys  na  die
salarisse van  munisipale  bestuurders.  Hulle  wil  nie  nog  wag  vir  die
``gravy'' wat hulle eendag hier  gaan  kry  nie.  Hulle  wil  die  ``gravy''
sommer al daar ónder hê! [Tussenwerpsels.]

Politieke partye sal ook moet kyk na die kwaliteit van hulle  raadslede,  en
dit sluit álle politieke partye in. Die besware van munisipaliteite oor  die
implementering van sekere dele van die  wetgewing  en  regulasies  skep  ook
probleme.

Daarom dink ek  huidige  konsepwetgewing  voor  die  Portefeuljekomitee  oor
Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering, byvoorbeeld oor grondbelasting, gaan  ook
beslis  tot  groot  probleme  lei.  Daarom  versoek  die  DA  dat  daar  met
omsigtigheid na die billikheid van dié  soort  wetgewing  gekyk  moet  word.
Aandag sal gegee moet word aan die  regverdige  toepasbaarheid  van  hierdie
voorgestelde konsepwetgewing op grondbelasting, om maar een  te  noem.  Baie
dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[These facts that the DA have given here today, are not  ones  that  I  have
fabricated. This is the factual information that was given to  us  committee
members during the fact-finding mission we were part of. You can read  about
it in that brochure that was published. Therefore,  a  huge  challenge  lies
ahead and the DA is prepared to help the Government to  make  a  success  of
municipalities. All that the ANC-New NP-alliance should do  is  to  look  at
the success stories of DA-controlled municipalities. It is as easy as that!

We agree, however, that it is indeed the government level  that  is  closest
to the people and we are all in agreement that we should make a  success  of
that. We must make a success of that, but  then  more  attention  should  be
given to training. I think my colleague  will  elaborate  further  on  that.
Serious attention will also have to be given to the  quality  of  officials,
as we have also heard, that are appointed. [Interjections.]

Attention really may very well also be given to  the  astronomical  salaries
which some officials earn. I mean, Minister Manuel has already  referred  to
the salaries of municipal managers.  They  do  not  want  to  wait  for  the
``gravy'' that they will receive here some  day.  They  want  the  ``gravy''
down there without further ado! [Interjections.]

Political  parties  will  also  have  to  look  at  the  quality  of   their
councillors, and that includes all  political  parties.  The  objections  of
municipalities about the implementation of certain parts of the  legislation
and regulations are also creating problems.

For that reason I am of the opinion that  the  present  concept  legislation
before the Portfolio Committee on Provincial  and  Local  Government,  about
land tax for example, will also definitely cause great  problems.  For  that
reason the DA requests that the equity of this type  of  legislation  should
be looked at with caution. Attention will have to be given to the  equitable
enforceability of this proposed concept legislation on  land  tax,  to  name
but one. Thank you very much.]

[Mr B J NOBUNGA: Madam Deputy Speaker, we are tabling before this hon  House
a report  about  our  visits  to  municipalities,  and  it  shows  how  deep
democracy runs in this country, which will be very clear on the day when  we
will be celebrating the 40 years since this  African  country  succeeded  in
its long struggle for unity, peace and stability.

In my endeavour I  will  be  discussing  the  dissemination  of  powers  and
functions of the two categories  of  municipalities  -  local  and  district
municipalities.

In our visits to the municipalities, we  discovered  that  the  relationship
between the two categories of municipalities differs. It proceeds  from  the
co-operative to that of non-co-operative and non-progressive.  This  creates
a great need for the clear definition of the roles and  functions  of  these
two levels of municipalities, the revisitation of the role  that  should  be
played by the district municipalities in helping the  local  municipalities,
and the boundaries  that  should  be  drawn  between  those  two  levels  of
municipalities.

Most of the municipalities said that the allocation of powers  that  has  to
be implemented between the two levels of municipalities seems to have  taken
a very long time and yet there was no  proper  communication,  as  they  had
thought  there  would  be.  Also,  the  Minister  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government should complete the finalities, what we  call  ``authorisation''.
There should have been a lot of  communication  before  the  Minister  could
have signed with regard to the levels pertaining to the powers  that  should
be bestowed upon the municipalities. Those powers are for  the  distribution
of water supply, sanitation, health, and  the  installation  of  electricity
supply.

This includes standardisation,  what  we  call  ``organisation'',  which  is
supposed to be done by provincial governments, what we call  ``MECs'',  with
regard to the power that should have been delayed  in  being  given  to  the
municipalities, taking into consideration  their  various  abilities,  while
using the bodies called ``Municipal Demarcation Boards.''

Nevertheless, there were a few municipalities who said  that  they  did  not
see the need for the district councils. They claimed that it  seemed  as  if
the work of the district council was just another waste  of  the  taxpayers'
money and time, because the district councils  are  so  arrogant,  yet  they
don't have the capacity to  do  some  of  their  duties,  like  distributing
certain services to the diverse communities accordingly.

Though there are municipalities who claim  not  to  see  the  works  of  the
district municipalities, those municipalities are there to stay,  especially
the small local municipalities. They see the good work that is done  by  the
district municipalities. However, the larger municipalities claim  that  the
district municipalities should be  responsible  for  communication  and  the
making of policies for the distribution of basic services;  meanwhile  basic
services are the responsibility of the local municipalities.]

The following are the challenges  that  district  municipalities  face.  The
first is that their boundaries are questionable and  they  are  not  viable.
Some  of  these  district  municipalities  feel  that  they  have  not  been
allocated adequate powers  and  functions.  Several  complained  that  their
powers and functions  have  been  reduced  owing  to  the  newly  demarcated
boundaries of municipalities.

The second challenge is that the local municipalities insist that  they  are
autonomous and refuse to acknowledge  a  district  role  beyond  wanting  to
confer with them on certain projects. The third one is that they are  graded
the  same  as  some  of  the  local  municipalities  within  the  very  same
jurisdiction, and they also feel that some local municipalities  within  the
same jurisdiction are graded even higher than they are.

There  are  also  common  challenges  that  are  faced  by   both   district
municipalities and local municipalities that pertain to  the  issue  of  the
autonomy of local government as enshrined in the Constitution.  There  is  a
greater feeling on the  part  of  both  district  municipalities  and  local
government that  national  Government  and  provincial  government  are  not
giving local municipalities the room that they require in order  to  perform
their functions and execute their powers.

Some of these municipalities expressed reservations about  the  capacity  of
the provinces to deliver, effectively, primary health services.  One  strong
district municipality said that it is currently  providing  health  services
on an agency basis on behalf of a  province,  and  that  that  province  has
since not paid it the dues that are due to that particular municipality,  to
the tune of R20 million.

There are also calls for clarity on the respective roles  of  the  provinces
and municipalities in providing libraries, roads and housing, and  how  this
should be funded. There  are  far  too  many  role-players  responsible  for
services in the area of municipalities. Some municipalities  said  that  the
provision of water involved too many role-players, namely the Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry and the water boards, while in some  cases  water
is also provided by municipalities.
Another challenge is the issue of  the  provision  of  land  tenure  rights.
According to municipalities, there seems  to  be  a  problem  regarding  the
manner in which the Department of Land Affairs  is  pursuing  the  issue  of
allocation  of  land  and  the  manner  in  which  traditional  leaders  are
participating in providing land in rural areas.

The portfolio committee explored with some of the more  effective  districts
the reasons they were working well. In the case of most  of  the  districts,
it  emerged  that  the  boundaries  of  those  district  municipalities  had
remained  largely  unchanged  from  those  of  previous  regional   services
councils. The fact that most of  the  members  that  are  serving  in  those
district municipalities have been serving since the pre-2000  interim  phase
of local municipalities has also contributed a great deal to  ensuring  that
there is stability in the manner in which  those  councils  are  being  run.

Mr P F SMITH: I wish to start by acknowledging that  although  the  IFP  did
not participate in the study tour and did not  contribute  significantly  to
the report itself, we  did  comment  on  the  draft  and  believe  that  the
document is an important document that should be studied by  all  those  who
believe in the success of local government of the country.  [Interjections.]
The  reason  for  not  joining  the  tour  is  simply  that,  due   to   the
intransigence of, the ANC and their attempts to manipulate the  Constitution
in respect of floor-crossing, we in KwaZulu-Natal  were  going  to  call  an
early election. Members such as myself  have  a  loyalty  to  the  party  in
contesting an election, rather than swanning around  the  countryside  on  a
study tour. That is the reason we were not there.

Having said that, we believe that the document is an important one,  and  we
would like to make a few observations in this regard.  [Interjections.]  You
are a noisy crowd!

First of all, I think we must agree with the general thrust of  the  report.
I think it is particularly important to  recognise  here  that  an  approach
towards the success and failure of local government has to be  done  from  a
perspective which recognises the real constraints and challenges facing  all
of us, the municipalities and the provincial and national Government. It  is
very important to adopt a sufficiently long-term  timeframe  in  respect  of
judging the transformation process. Anyone who  expects  miracles  within  a
year or two of the elections is going to be  sorely  disappointed.  I  think
the party would agree with the view that we need a  10-15  year  horizon  in
this regard and, in fact, we are only now a few months into year 3 from  the
2000 elections.

Judging from that perspective, I think we would  say  that,  by  and  large,
municipalities are making better progress than might have been  anticipated.
Having said that, that should not be taken as a justification  for  anything
which is plainly wrong and, if one is looking at ineptitude,  greed,  graft,
corruption, etc, obviously those things have to be put to  bed  post  haste,
and they've got nothing to do with timeframes involved in  our  judging  the
success or otherwise of local government.

Having agreed with the general approach,  may  I  comment  on  a  couple  of
specifics? The first is on the issue of  district  councils.  Here  I  would
like to take issue with our colleagues or our allies  in  local  government,
the DA. We hold a completely different view in respect of  the  desirability
of the two-tier system outside the metro. In fact, even in  respect  of  the
metro, we held the view during the  White  Paper  process  that  a  two-tier
system should be one of the options on  the  smorgasbord  of  types.  Having
said that, I think we would agree with some  of  the  observations  made  in
respect of the difficulties  that  we  have  with  the  two-tier  system  at
present.

Certainly, there is a need to strengthen the perceptions of role-players  on
the need. There is a greater need for people to understand why  there  is  a
two-tier system and how it is going to function, particularly  how  the  B's
and C's are meant to work together. It is problematic at present. It is  not
helped by the fact that the powers and functions of the two tiers  have  not
yet been finalised. We have had a  situation  that  was  obtained  in  2000,
where the 2-year transition  was  extended  for  6  months;  there  are  new
determinations in respect of the national  Ministry  and  of  the  provinces
which are going to come into effect on 1 July.

However, even when that process is completed, there  will  still  be  powers
and functions that  will  not  be  not  resolved  yet.  We  still  have  the
electrification rates that are outstanding. This whole issue of  powers  and
functions  has  bedevilled  relations  between  the   B's   and   C's   and,
unfortunately, it is likely to continue doing so for  some  time.  We  would
like greater effort to be put into reducing this conflict.

Also, the issue of financial arrangements between the B's and  C's  is  also
problematic. The department has promised us that this year - I am  not  sure
how on earth they are going to process  that  this  year  -  there  will  be
legislation to regulate the financial  relationship  between  B's  and  C's.
Assuming we get this legislation, that would be a healthy development.

I would also like to mention that the capacity constraints are something  we
strongly agreed on, which is in the  report.  It  is  a  highly  problematic
issue, and we believe far more needs to be done in terms  of  engaging  with
capacity-building within the municipalities in question. We  would  like  to
commend the  chair  and  the  committee  itself  for  having  initiated  the
process. Last week, a workshop was convened by the committee  at  which  all
important role-players  were  present  to  determine  the  problems  of  the
present capacity-building and what could be done. The process has  been  put
into effect which, we trust, will pay positive dividends.

We  are  also  of  the  view  that  financial  difficulties  experienced  by
municipalities are the major issue for many  municipalities.  The  issue  is
not one of capacity.  Certainly,  we  have  a  Local  Government:  Municipal
Finance Management Bill that should be passed this  year,  and  if  capacity
constraints are now problematic, it is going to  be  worse  once  that  Bill
comes out because it is a very complex piece of  legislation.  The  pressure
it is going to put on financial management within municipalities is  greater
than we have at present. We have that problem of capacity and the  statutory
environment in which the municipality is operating.

There are also issues like debt collection and  others.  Municipalities  are
constantly writing off debts, and the problem of  collecting  arrears  is  a
massive problem. The municipalities really need to do more than that.

Irrespective of all  the  problems,  we  strongly  believe  that  the  basic
financial system dealing with the funding  of  municipalities  needs  to  be
reviewed. The notion that  municipalities  derive  ninety-odd  per  cent  of
their funds from ratable income may be true in aggregate, but  if  you  look
at poorer municipalities in particular, the funding is highly problematic.

Thirdly, may I comment briefly  on  what  the  report  has  to  say  on  the
participation of traditional leadership in local government.  For  the  most
part, the report tries to be noncontentious and merely enumerates levels  of
participation that it observed and the comments that municipalities made  in
this  regard.  This  is  fine;  nothing  contentious  about  that.  It  also
acknowledges that there is a dispute between traditional leaders  and  other
role-players, particularly Government, on this matter, and that it needs  to
be addressed on an  urgent  basis  and  that  there  is  a  White  Paper  on
traditional leadership and framework legislation  that  is  to  be  welcomed
when it comes through.

This is all very well. That process is at work. It is very clear  to  us  as
participants, within and outside the committee,  that  irrespective  of  the
language being used to welcome the process - the White Paper  and  so  on  -
the view of the committee, as is  the  rule  of  the  ruling  party  and  of
Government, is one which is totally at  odds  with  the  view  expressed  by
parties such as ourselves and other stakeholders in respect of the  kind  of
government system we would like to see in place in  respect  of  traditional
leadership and institutions of traditional leadership.

When the chairperson said in terms of this report that the main  issues  are
those of strategy, planning and implementation and that they are  not  major
issues of principle or conceptual problems within  the  report,  it  may  be
true in terms of those who participated but, as  the  IFP,  we  would  argue
that there is conflict over the shape and form of  local  government  in  so
far as it deals with traditional communities. It  is  a  fundamental  schism
between the parties that is the foundational conflict but, other than  that,
we would like to say that the report is very good and we endorse it.

Mr A G LYLE: Comrade Deputy  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  our
Chairperson, Comrade Carrim, for a job well done in honing  this  collective
effort into a fine and instructive report. To my comrades, hon B  J  Nobunga
and Sithole  Mshudulu,  thank  you  for  your  excellent  companionship  and
outstanding  leadership  qualities  during  our  visits   to   the   various
municipalities.

Financial   issues   constitute   the    biggest    challenge    confronting
municipalities. Clearly, there is a need for a new financial system for  the
new model of developmental local  government.  A  review  of  the  financial
system is being dealt with by the major stakeholders. In the main issues  to
be reviewed are the equitable share formula; REC  levies;  capacity-building
grants; infrastructure transfers; property  rates;  the  fiscal  powers  and
functions of district councils and municipalities, and the remunerations  of
councillors and municipal managers.

The Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill and  Property  Rates
Bill before Parliament will have a significant impact on the  new  financial
system of local government. Most municipalities have a  credit  control  and
debt collection policy. A significant number of municipalities are  not  yet
billing everybody using services, as they are  still  gathering  information
on residents and do not have proper billing systems in place.

Some new municipalities which  are  a  composite  of  former  municipalities
still have to merge their systems  into  one.  Several  municipalities  lack
suitably qualified personnel to improve their billing systems. For  want  of
capacity, several municipalities have begun  to  outsource  debt  collection
and have found this to  be  an  effective  tool.  Some  municipalities  have
introduced incentive schemes to encourage residents to pay. This has  had  a
measure of  success.  The  introduction  of  free  basic  service  has  been
misconstrued by some residents and thus served  to  discourage  payment  for
services.

Where municipalities have conducted public meetings on the need to  pay  for
services, reasonable progress has  been  made.  One  municipality  increased
payment levels from 65% to 94% in a year and moved the municipality  from  a
deficit to a surplus of R400 000. From records compiled  by  municipalities,
it is clear that there are residents who  have  the  means  of  paying,  but
refuse to do so. Many  municipalities  complain  that  national  and  mainly
provincial Governments constantly fail to pay for  rates  and  services  and
for agencies' functions fulfilled on their behalf.

Municipalities also stated that they had to bear  the  administrative  costs
of housing delivery. It has  been  mentioned  by  one  speaker  before.  One
municipality said it was owed  R400  000  000  by  national  and  provincial
Government. Another said it was owed R150 000 000 by provincial  government,
and yet another was owed over R25 000 000 by the provincial  government.  To
this end, one councillor said:


  It is not ethical for government departments not to pay. They  should  be
  leading by example.

Several municipalities complained that public servants are not paying  their
personal services or rates. However, the  municipalities  continue  to  bill
them and expect payment to be made.  Most  municipalities  acknowledge  that
the percentage of the budget allocated to capital expenditure  is  far  from
adequate and  the  salaries  constitute  too  high  a  percentage  of  their
budgets. However, there has  been  an  improvement  in  this  regard  and  a
greater  percentage  of  the  budget  has  been  directed  towards   capital
expenditure over the past two years.
The vast majority of municipalities have said that the  equitable  share  is
not adequate. The portfolio committee believes that the municipalities  have
to make far more effective and productive use  of  their  limited  resources
that they have. Debt collection must be intensified towards those  that  can
pay, in particular, the private sector, the other spheres of government  and
public servants. However, if the new system of local government is going  to
be  effectively  implemented  and  municipalities  are   to   fulfil   their
constitutional mandate, national and  provincial  Government  will  have  to
allocate  more  money,  resources  and  other  forms  of  support  to  local
government.

The Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill  must  become  an
effective tool in the management of municipal finances. Some  municipalities
are simply not viable unless drastic action is taken. The Demarcation  Board
might well have to consider the boundaries of some of these  municipalities.
The general dissatisfaction with REC levies demands a  new  need  to  review
them.  Municipalities  need  to  be  more  informed  about   the   financial
implications  for  themselves  in  the  restructuring  of  the   electricity
industry. Local government should make greater efforts to  reduce  costs  on
personnel expenditure  and  redirect  these  limited  resources  to  capital
expenditure.

Finally, the review of  local  government  financial  systems  needs  to  be
speeded  up.  A  new  financial  dispensation  commensurate  with  the   new
developmental model of local government has  to  be  finalised.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE:  Deputy  Chairperson  and  Deputy  Minister,  the  report
highlights the need for intervention by national and  provincial  Government
and  other  stakeholders  to  assist   municipalities   to   improve   their
administrative functions. A number of key problems have been identified.

There is slow progress in creating an updated database  of  information  and
billing systems of  residences  within  municipalities.  Performance  audits
from municipal managers and senior managers  cannot  be  recorded,  as  some
municipalities have failed to conclude  appropriate  performance  contracts.
There are also major problems that exist between  local  municipalities  and
districts with regard to the division of powers and functions.

Although Government  requires  that  municipalities  adopt  a  developmental
approach, national and provincial Governments are slow in spelling  out  the
plans they want local municipalities to engage in within  the  framework  of
the  Integrated  Development  Plan.  Financially,  municipalities  have   to
contend with how to manage their budgetary allowance within  the  sphere  of
their duties and meet the requirements of free basic services.

One of the downsides, though, of this provision of free basic  services,  is
that it impacts on other services. Where there are  arrears  in  payment  of
certain  services,  the  community  expects  municipalities  to  write   off
arrears.

Provincial  governments  have  been  accused  of   fiscal   dumping,   which
exacerbates municipalities' expenditure capacity. Lots of money is  owed  to
municipalities by Government, public servants and the private  sector.  This
adds to the municipalities' inability  to  exercise  their  responsibilities
more appropriately.

Ward committees are the foundation of good  democracy.  However,  due  to  a
lack of policy direction, many ward committees are either  incapacitated  or
defunct due to internal strife. Municipalities  need  to  do  everything  in
their power to build up communities' capacities in their regions.

The ACDP feels that the visit has vindicated its position  that  the  powers
and functions of councils will be  reduced  if  we  have  a  large  top-down
structure. The mayoral executive committee must  be  scrapped.  We  need  to
reassess the two-tier system and, may I add, the ANC council has  asked  for
a review on this. In fact, they said it shouldn't even be there at all.

There is open conflict between district and local communities, and they  are
in constant battle. These are some of  the  hindrances  to  effective  local
government, and the sooner we  can  iron  out  the  problems  of  a  bloated
hierarchy, the better it will be for municipalities  to  concern  themselves
with direct local issues. Thank you, Mr Chair.

[Time expired.]

Rev A D GOOSEN: Thank you, Deputy Chair. I will be  speaking  on  integrated
governance and planning.

The compilation of the IDPs, which is the Integrated Development  Plans,  by
municipalities,  was  of  paramount  importance  to  us,  especially   since
priorities were going to be set by it and because it was  going  to  be  the
basis for service delivery.

Needless to say,  virtually  most  of  the  municipalities  we  visited  had
completed their IDPs, but due to the time constraints placed on  them,  they
had to sacrifice quality for  quantity.  However,  many  of  them  vowed  to
improve on their IDPs in their annual review.

I must add that the IDPs were of  great  importance  to  municipalities  and
many of them were enthusiastic about the process of  compiling  them,  while
some said it was a worthwhile experience because councillors had to work  in
close proximity with officials in order to ensure a good product.

Most municipalities used  IDPs  structures  to  oversee  the  process,  with
councillors and officials playing an important  part.  Other  municipalities
drew stakeholders to meetings while others had workshops,  public  meetings,
ward committees or a mixture of these. There are municipalities that held  a
whole range of meetings that were very well attended.

The IDP process was much more of a challenge to  district  councils  though,
especially since they had no ward committees and,  therefore,  had  to  find
alternative means of ensuring community participation.

We have no idea of what the effect of  consultation  was  because,  in  some
instances, it was said that communities merely  had  to  endorse  the  final
product whereas, in other instances, communities were  part  of  the  entire
process.

In  some  instances,  communities  had  very  high  expectations  which  the
municipalities knew were unachievable, because they would  not  be  able  to
deliver on those demands. The  difficulty  that  municipalities  encountered
was to balance the priorities  or  targets  with  practical  and  realisable
plans, taking into account the availability of  funds,  resources,  capacity
as well as the extent to which  both  provincial  and  national  Governments
would co-operate.

We found that many municipalities made extensive use  of  consultants.  Many
municipalities were aware of the shortcomings of using  consultants  because
they had to draw on their services in ways that  were  optimally  beneficial
to them.

As far as IDPs and budgets are concerned, we found that many  municipalities
could not link the two adequately. In some  instances,  we  found  that  the
budget was drawn up and that the IDP,  so  to  say,  was  patched  onto  the
budget.

Some municipalities mentioned that the linking  of  the  two  was  difficult
because  provincial  and  national  Governments  do  not  allow  funds   for
priorities identified by  the  IDP.  Other  complaints  that  municipalities
shared with us included the following. The  IDP  is  approved  by  the  MEC,
whereas the budget  is  referred  to  the  National  Treasury,  thus  posing
problems for  both  provincial  and  national  Governments  to  ensure  that
municipalities align  their  IDPs,  and  budgets.  The  provincial  and  the
national Governments ignore the IDPs and their  spheres  do  not  spell  out
what  their  plan  was  for  the  area  in  which  the  municipalities  have
jurisdiction. Both provincial and national Governments have  programmes  and
projects that are inconsistent with  municipalities'  IDP  priorities.  They
said  that  provincial  departments   have   their   own   priorities,   and
municipalities are, so to say, pushed in that direction. They don't  consult
municipalities and they do what they like.  Parastatals,  likewise,  do  not
take the IDP seriously.

Many  municipalities  would  like  to  see  provincial   IDPs   or   general
development plans  and  municipal  IDPs  complementing  each  other,  and  a
national IDP or general development plan to see the light of day.

The  provincial  departments  we  visited  said  that  the   Department   of
Provincial and Local Government  and  other  national  departments  directly
allocate funds to municipalities, thus bypassing them and, in  the  process,
making their task of monitoring municipalities more difficult. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Geagte Voorsitter, op bladsy 22 van  die  verslag  staan
die volgende: ``Financial issues certainly constitute the biggest  challenge
confronting  municipalities''.  Dis  die  kern  van  hierdie  verslag.   Die
grootste bron van inkomste vir plaaslike regering is juis  dienstegelde.  In
die verslag self word gemeld dat die agterstallige dienstegelde in  Desember
verlede  jaar  alreeds  R24,3 miljard  beloop  het.  Dit  is  meer  as   die
verdedigingsbegroting.

Die  afgelope  10  jaar  waarsku  die  VF  dat  agterstallige   dienstegelde
plaaslike regering op sy knieë gaan dwing. Elke keer sê  die  Minister  daar
word gekyk na die probleem, maar die VF verstaan nie die probleem nie,  want
apartheid  het  swart  plaaslike  regerings  in  die  skuld  gedompel.   Die
werklikheid is dat swart plaaslike  regerings  se  skuld  in  1993  en  1994
volgens 'n ooreenkoms tussen mnr Mandela en mnr F W de Klerk afgeskryf is.

Die verslag self meld dat die meeste munisipaliteite  'n  invorderingsbeleid
het, maar dit nie toepas nie. Dit is die werklike probleem: die onvermoë  om
'n  beleid  uit  te  voer  en  toe  te  pas.  Intussen  verdien   munisipale
bestuurders astronomiese salarisse. In  Nketwana  in  die  Oos-Vrystaat,  'n
klein dorpie met 14 751  huishoudings,  verdien  die  munisipale  bestuurder
R400 000 per jaar. Ses departementshoofde verdien elk R300 827 per jaar.

Die gemeenskap kan nouliks sulke amptenare bekostig. In  plaas  daarvan  dat
die Regering aandag gee aan die hoë salarisse  en  onvermoë  van  munisipale
bestuurders om onder meer agterstallige dienstegelde in  te  vorder,  beraam
hy allerhande ander planne om vuisvoos belastingbetalers nog meer te  belas.
Dit gaan nie help om hierdie mense meer  te  belas  nie.  Daar  sal  ernstig
gekyk moet word na maniere hoe om hierdie dienstegelde  in  te  vorder.  Dit
help nie 'n mens het amptenare wat hoë salarisse kry, maar  nie  hulle  werk
doen nie. As die agterstallige dienstegelde nie ingevorder word nie,  sê  ek
vir u is  plaaslike  regering  gedoem.  Dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Chairperson, on page 22  of  the  report  the  following
appears: ``Financial  issues  certainly  constitute  the  biggest  challenge
confronting municipalities''. That is the crux of this report.  The  largest
source of income for local government is  indeed  service  charges.  In  the
report it is mentioned  that  in  December  last  year  outstanding  service
charges already amounted to R24,3 billion. That is  more  than  the  defence
budget.

Over the past ten years the FF has warned that outstanding  service  charges
will bring local government to its knees. Every time the Minister says  that
the problem is being looked at, but the FF does not understand the  problem,
since apartheid plunged black local governments into debt. In  reality,  the
debt of black local governments was written off during 1993 and  1994  as  a
result of an agreement between Mr Mandela and Mr F W De Klerk.

The report itself mentions that most municipalities have a  debt  collection
policy, but it is not applied. That is the real problem:  the  inability  to
execute and apply  a  policy.  In  the  meantime,  municipal  managers  earn
astronomical salaries. In Nketwana in the Eastern Free State, a  small  town
with 14 751 households, the municipal manager earns R400 000 per  year.  Six
department heads each earn R300 287 per year.
The community can  hardly  afford  such  officials.  Instead  of  Government
paying attention to these high  salaries  and  the  inability  of  municipal
managers to collect outstanding service charges, amongst other things,  they
are making all kinds of plans to tax punch-drunk  taxpayers  even  more.  It
will not help to tax these people more.

A serious look will have to be taken at  ways  in  which  to  collect  those
outstanding debts. It does not help us to have officials  who  receive  high
salaries, but who do  not  do  their  work.  If  these  outstanding  service
charges are not collected, then, I am telling you, local government will  be
doomed. Thank you.]

[Mr B M KOMPHELA: Chairperson and hon members of Parliament,  I  would  also
like to say something about our trip to  the  provinces  where  we  went  to
study  the  work  done  by   the   municipalities.   Bringing   changes   to
municipalities is something  very  important  in  the  Constitution  of  our
country. However, in order to bring about those changes, the  municipalities
have to bring services to the people.

The important thing is the trial of  these  new  municipalities  which  have
been working only since the year 2000. They have not  worked  for  five,  or
even three years yet. They are still without much experience, and  the  work
they have done so far calls for us to be happy for them and to applaud  them
for their good work. Yet, we do agree that there are  still  some  problems.
They have made some good progress, but  some  important  aspects  are  still
needed to finalise matters.

The one big challenge that they are facing is that most  municipalities  are
still inexperienced, imperfect and unable to speed up the changes.  However,
if you really look objectively, you will notice, Mr Mulder, that  they  have
made an amazing effort. They have not just welcomed defeat.

Chairperson, allow me to point out the  difficulties  that  they  are  faced
with. Municipalities are crying out for help from  the  national  Government
and provinces. We do believe that municipalities would achieve a lot if  the
provinces and national Government would help them out. They  would  be  able
to bring services to  the  people  and  thus  enable  people  to  get  basic
services.

Another important thing is that there seem  to  be  some  problems,  and  if
there is any disharmony and disagreement in municipalities, Government  will
give 6kl of water to the people. Our people do get water and  municipalities
try very hard to make sure that people get these basic services.

However, let me explain the kinds of problems that we have. When people  are
on a private farm that belongs to a white man, how do municipalities  manage
to ensure that these people get water? Because if the white  person  or  the
owner  of  that  farm  does  not  allow  it,  there  is  no  way  that   the
municipalities can give basic  services  there,  because  it  is  a  private
place.

Another important thing is that municipalities have a problem because  there
are two basic services that are given to people within a municipality. I  am
sure that Eskom is now getting big-headed. It has to give basic services  to
the  people,  but  one  will  notice  that  in  places   where   Eskom   and
municipalities both give their services to the people, there is tension  and
people fight because one will find that some  people  on  one  side  of  the
street do not get these free services while others on the other side do  get
them, because Eskom refuses to give people these free  services.  It  should
not be up to Eskom to agree or to disagree. Eskom is part of our  Government
and Eskom belongs to us. It must provide those services.

Another important thing that I would like us to talk about is that there  is
a  problem  with  what   is   called   ``equitable   share''   in   English.
Municipalities would like to know how these funds would be divided and  what
criteria would be used to determine  whether  or  not  they  would  get  the
funds.

If the criteria used are  the  ones  which  were  used  in  1996,  then  the
municipalities have a reason to express dissatisfaction because these  funds
are not  distributed  equally,  because  the  criteria  used  do  not  allow
struggling municipalities to get the funds.

Our intention, as the ANC, is that  the  stronger  and  able  municipalities
should  help  the  weaker   and   struggling   municipalities,   and   those
municipalities  which  have  basic  services  to  offer  should  make   them
available to the people.

I would also like to tell you about this one municipality that  we  visited,
where we were told that they can give basic services to  the  people  living
on farms. However, the only problem is that  if  they  have  to  give  those
services for free, they can do so, but it would be difficult to give  people
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members,  the  wall-to-wall  system  of
municipalities has called into action the need for closer working  relations
amongst  stakeholders.  It  is   necessary   that   the   ward   committees,
councillors, district and local councils work closely  together  to  make  a
success of local governance.

The report sets out clearly in paragraph 16(3) that, and I quote:


  All who commented on cross-boundary municipalities said that they are not
  viable.

This is contrary to the view held  by  the  Ministry  in  its  answer  to  a
question on this matter earlier this year. We  hope  that  the  Presidential
Task Team, set to look into this matter and which is supposed to  report  in
July will do so, and that decisive action will be taken to remove this  grey
area in local government.

It has come to light that very few women are in positions of  responsibility
in the employment of municipalities. This skewed position needs  to  be  set
right.

The unresolved role and status of traditional leaders in municipal  councils
keeps surfacing like a sore finger on an otherwise healthy  palm.  Some  are
reported  to  be  co-operating,  some  are  acquiescing  whilst  others  are
nonchalant about the matter. In some municipalities,  those  who  serve  are
not even remunerated while in others they  are.  Surely  this  needs  to  be
resolved as a matter of urgency.

This report gives a bird's eye view of what is happening in the  country  in
local governance. It has proved to be invaluable reading material.
Finally, great thanks should go to the committee members who  traversed  the
whole country by visiting all nine provinces in one-and-a-half weeks. It  is
only dedicated people who can do something  like  that.  We  pray  much  for
their strength and beg that the report not be left on the shelves to  gather
dust.

The UCDP endorses the report. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, with the first democratic  election,  we  took
on a three-tier system of governance, namely national, provincial and  local
government, where each operated independently of the other so as to  prevent
power being saturated into one body and to maintain a system of  checks  and
balances.

Demarcation of power and procedures outlined by  the  national  Constitution
governs the supreme law. The three tiers have thus far managed to  uphold  a
good working relationship.

The visits to the provincial and local government are not only to  check  on
the maintenance  of  these  relationships,  but  to  ensure  that  the  plan
prescribed in structures and procedures  for  these  government  bodies  are
upheld. The establishment of new amalgamated  municipal  structures  appears
to be satisfactory  and  the  functioning  of  councils,  though  exhibiting
constant activity, requires more. Clarity is required, though, on  a  number
of issues such as the roles of persons in authority and so on. The MF  hopes
that this will be worked through.

There appears to be  a  bit  of  tension  between  permanent  and  part-time
councillors that needs to be eradicated, and in  the  relationships  between
councillors and senior management. The MF notes the problem of clarity  with
the  division  of  power  and   functions   between   district   and   local
municipalities, and sees the need for legislation to  clarify  this.  It  is
pleasing to  note  that  almost  all  municipalities  have  completed  their
Integrated Development Plans with room for improvement. In view  of  linking
IDP's and budgets, it would  help  provincial  and  national  Government  to
allocate money specifically, rather than in the ad hoc manner that it does.

The MF notes that financial issues are a major challenge  to  municipalities
and requests that national and  provincial  Government  make  the  necessary
payments owing. It is  pleasing  to  note  community  participation  in  the
municipalities and the increase in service delivery such as free services.

The  MF  congratulates  the  chairperson  on  a  comprehensive  report,  and
endorses it. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J J KGARIMETSA: Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members.

La me ke go simolola ka borre dikgosi gore re tle re ikokotlele mmogo ka  le
tsola-tshipi. Gore gape ke bue ka SALGA jaaka  mogapatiro  mo  Pegong  e  ke
tlileng go neelana ka yona fa. [Mine is to start with our chiefs so that  we
can lean on one another. I  will  speak  about  Salga  like  a  director  of
proceedings in the report that I will present.]

Like people elsewhere in the country and in  the  rest  of  the  world,  our
people in these areas are  entitled  to  a  better  life.  The  ideology  of
development,  therefore,   is   but   a   matter   of   simultaneous   South
Africanisation  and  globalisation.  When  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership embraces it, that act  alone  opens  space  for  engagement  with
people's problems and with directed change.

On 5 December this year, our new system of local government  will  be  three
years old. Whereas the majority of the rural population  were  excluded  and
peripheralised  from  the  developmental  considerations,  the   new   local
government system guaranteed them institutional inclusion.

Our conception of local government is that of an  engine  which  powers  the
process of development. This is a daunting challenge which  can  be  lighter
if, and only if, it is shared.
With regard to the report on the visit  which  the  committee  undertook  to
various provinces on study tours of different municipalities,  the  role  of
traditional leaders in local government is, of course,  subject  to  dispute
and is being reviewed at the moment.

In some municipalities, particularly in one  province,  traditional  leaders
do participate in council meetings or other municipal activities.  In  other
municipalities, traditional leaders  are  active  in  council  meetings  and
other  municipal  affairs.  And,  in   yet   other   municipalities,   while
traditional leaders do not officially participate in council meetings,  they
are informally active in municipal affairs. It  is  difficult  to  tell  how
representative the municipalities we visited are  of  the  participation  of
traditional leaders in municipalities in the country as  a  whole.  However,
in  a  significant  majority  of  the  municipalities  in  our  study  tour,
traditional leaders are either officially or informally active in  municipal
affairs.

In one  municipality,  traditional  leaders  have  signed  a  memorandum  of
understanding with  the  council  and  work  closely  with  councillors  and
officials  on  development  issues.  The   traditional   leaders   in   that
municipality  have  been  raising  R10  per  household  per  month  for  the
municipality for development projects. An amount of R600 000 was  raised  in
the previous year. A report on municipalities notes, and I quote:


  There are two areas under our jurisdiction with traditional leaders.  The
  municipalities are working closely with them. Council meetings have  been
  held in their areas and traditional leaders have been assisted  with  the
  provision of offices.

A report on another municipality notes that, and I quote:


  Participation  of  traditional  leaders  in   municipalities   is   good.
  Traditional authorities are involved in all projects that take  place  in
  their areas. There is a constant attempt to better manage and improve  on
  the relationship between traditional leadership and council, and the need
  for more regular participation of traditional authorities must be  looked
  at.  Several  interactive  meetings  have  been  held  with   traditional
  leadership. Outstanding  legislation  for  participation  of  traditional
  leaders is delaying  delivery  and  slowing  full  participation  in  the
  council.

In the case of yet another municipality, a report notes that three areas  of
traditional leadership exist. All three leaders  are  participating  in  the
council and  all  its  proceedings.  Regular  meetings  are  held  with  the
regional authority on traditional  leadership.  Traditional  leaders  should
participate more actively in municipalities with a  clear  understanding  of
distinctive roles. Several municipalities said  that  it  was  important  to
finalise policies on the role of traditional leaders in local government.  A
traditional leader who is  active  in  a  municipal  council  expressed  his
frustration at what  he  saw  as  a  failure  to  address  the  concerns  of
traditional leaders. [Time expired.][Applause.]
Mr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, soos 'n  refrein  klink  dit  deur  hierdie
rapport: beperkte middele  ...  [Mr  Chairman,  like  a  refrain  it  echoes
through this report: limited resources ...]

In section 17.9 of the report, it is stated, and I quote:


  Financial issues certainly constitute the biggest  challenge  confronting
  municipalities. Municipalities  have  to  make  far  more  effective  and
  productive use of limited resources.

The question is: Are resources really limited? If one looks at  the  mammoth
amount of R25 billion that is owed as outstanding  debt  to  municipalities,
it is rather the utilisation of the resources  that  is  lacking.  Financial
management in essence means maximising income,  minimising  expenditure  and
maximising effectivity.

Om die inkomste van plaaslike  owerhede  te  verhoog,  moet  hierdie  enorme
skuld van debiteure aangespreek word.  Die  rapport  gee  nie  'n  blyk  van
genoegsame finansiële beheermeganismes nie. Te dikwels word nie-betaling  as
'n soort demokratiese kultuur bejeën.

Wat die uitgawe betref: kan plaaslike owerhede  werklik  die  enorme  bedrae
bekostig wat  nodig  is  vir  die  sinnelose  naamsveranderinge  van  dorpe,
strate,  plekke  en  sentrums?  Verder   moet   salarisse   van   munisipale
bestuurders en direkteure beperk word. Die soustrein loop op  die  plaaslike
vlak. Talle van  hulle  verdien  meer  as  Ministers.  Minister  Manuel  het
hierdie saak in sy begrotingsrede aangespreek. Dit is nou tyd vir aksie.

Wat u verslag nie reflekteer nie: Salarisbegrotings van  plaaslike  owerhede
beloop  in  baie  gevalle  tussen  40%  en  50%.  Indien   die   koste   van
elektrisiteit, water en onderhoud bygevoeg word, bly slegs 5%  oor  vir  die
allernoodsaaklikste kapitale projekte. Daarmee  saam  het  effektiwiteit  in
die hek geduik met die onoordeelkundige afleggings en  uitdiensstellings  in
die naam van regstellende aksie. U verslag sê:


  There is an urgent overall  need  to  improve  management  and  practical
  implementation skills of councillors and officials.

Geen wonder nie. Daar is munisipaliteite waar tot 67%  van  sy  topamptenare
``tereggestel'', of te wel geforseer is om  aftreepakkette  te  neem.  Talle
blanke  bestuurders  moet  vrugteloos  aansoek  doen  vir  hule  eie  poste.
Daarbenewens is daar effektief 'n plafon op bevordering vir werkers uit  die
nie-aangewese kategorieë wat alle inisiatief demp.

Miskien hoef ons nie te ver te soek  nie.  Die  hoofsom  van  u  rapport  is
eenvoudig:  ``Back  to  basics''.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragaphs
follows.)

[To increase the income of local authorities this enormous debt  of  debtors
must be addressed. The report  does  not  give  an  indication  of  adequate
financial control mechanisms. Nonpayment is too often considered as  a  type
of democratic culture.

As far as the expenditure is concerned, can local authorities really  afford
the enormous amounts that are required for the senseless  changes  in  names
of towns, streets, places and centres? Furthermore,  salaries  of  municipal
managers and directors must be limited. The gravy train is  running  at  the
local level.  Many  of  them  earn  more  then  Ministers.  Minister  Manuel
addressed this issue in his Budget speech. It is now time for action.

What your report does not reflect: Salary budgets of local  authorities  are
in  many  cases  40%  to  50%.  If  the  costs  of  electricity,  water  and
maintenance are added, a mere  5%  remains  for  the  all-important  capital
projects. In association with that, effectiveness has taken a nosedive  with
the ill-considered retrenchments and dismissals in the name  of  affirmative
action. Your report goes:


  There is an urgent overall  need  to  improve  management  and  practical
  implication skills of councillors and officials.

This is no wonder. There are municipalities where  up  to  67%  of  the  top
officials have been ``executed'' or  forced  to  take  retirement  packages.
Many white managers must apply in vain  for  their  own  posts.  Apart  from
that, there is effectively a ceiling on the  promotion  of  workers  in  the
nondesignated categories, which dampens all initiative.

Perhaps we do not have to look far. The main point of the report is  simply:
Back to basics.]

Mr W P DOMAN: Deputy Chair,  it  is  of  paramount  importance  that  we  as
legislators through visits like these experience first-hand  the  effect  of
legislation in practice. We must then be bold enough to effect  the  changes
necessary to rectify mistakes or  improve  the  situation  where  unexpected
consequences resulted. In my presentation I want to concentrate on  what  we
must do and what the Ministry and the department must do.

Firstly, the highest praise must be given to hon Yunus Carrim, not only  for
the excellent report he drew up, but also for his leadership in  our  group,
where he ensured that discussions were frank. He  also  allowed  members  of
the opposition in the group and in the councils  to  participate  fully.  He
made it possible  that  we,  as  a  group,  could  set  an  example  to  the
councillors as to how they should work together, despite different views  on
certain matters.

In quite a number  of  successful  councils  this  working  together  was  a
noticeable  trend.  And  closely  linked  to   this   was   an   appropriate
relationship between councillors and officials, where  the  former  did  not
unduly interfere and issue unreasonable instructions, and the latter  served
all councillors equally.

This relationship will have to be defined more clearly and  given  practical
implementation. Planning-implementation-management systems, (PIMS),  centres
are a brainchild of the department in order to strengthen  the  capacity  of
weaker municipalities, especially in  the  nodal  areas.  This  is  a  total
failure and a waste of millions of rands.

It was ludicrous, in the first instance, to expect of  a  municipal  manager
and his staff to take much notice of a PIMS centre of three people, with  no
or an average knowledge of local government,  to  assist  them  with  highly
diverse administration systems.

To the  Deputy  Minister  I  want  to  say,  please  scrap  this  initiative
immediately, and use the money  to  subsidise  two  or  three  positions  in
finance and personnel  management,  where  the  municipalities  really  need
assistance. Let them  appoint  those  people,  but  with  your  department's
specifications to ensure that people who are appointed  can  really  make  a
difference.

On finance, we must be concerned that municipalities try  to  balance  their
budgets with exorbitant rates and  tax  hikes  that  the  average  ratepayer
cannot afford and with  no  consideration  for  the  national  economy.  The
percentages for capital expenditure at almost all  municipalities  are  very
small and totally inadequate for the necessary growth the economy needs.

Deputy Minister, you will have to ensure that the  Government's  unfortunate
restructuring  of  the  electricity  industry  will  not   totally   destroy
municipalities' income base. You and  your  department  will  also  have  to
ensure  that  the  equitable  share  sufficiently  covers  the  free   basic
services, because municipalities  are  actually  acting  as  agents  of  the
national Government in this regard.  Furthermore,  an  alternative  for  RSC
levies should also be found very soon.

It is clear from the visit that the training of  councillors  and  officials
is a shambles. Not only has the Local Government and  Water  Seta  delivered
almost nothing, but municipalities are  totally  confused  about  what  they
should expect  from  the  DPLG,  provincial  departments,  Salga  and  other
stakeholders.

Regarding  capacity  building  and  training  programmes,  we  endorse   the
report's urgent call  for  more  effective  co-ordination  and  co-operation
within a  commonly  accepted  framework.  We  applaud  the  efforts  of  the
portfolio committee, which last week started to rectify the  situation,  but
this should really be done  by  the  DPLG.  This  ties  in  with  the  total
uncertainty we encountered regarding the  role  that  provincial  and  local
government departments and Salga should play.

Our submission is that  the  DPLG  should  allow  provinces  to  play  their
constitutional role of monitoring, supporting and  promoting  the  capacity,
instead of trying to deal  with  councils  directly.  The  Intergovernmental
Relations Bill should be fast-tracked to address this relationship.

Apart from the important role  as  a  central  bargaining  organisation,  it
seems as if councils will lose  very  little  if  Salga  disappears.  Do  we
really need Salga to fulfil all the roles it is currently trying to  fulfil?
Is the R98 million that Salga is collecting in  the  form  of  levies,  from
ratepayers actually, apart from what the Parliament  also  votes  for  them,
well spent? Is there enough accountability within Salga to councils, to  the
public or to this Parliament?

In conclusion, all the good aspects and problems we encountered  about  ward
committees makes  one  asks  this  central  question:  Is  it  necessary  to
legislate for structures to which councillors must account?  Should  it  not
be left to civil society to organise itself at this level?

Hon MEMBERS: Yes!

Mr W P  DOMAN:  Shouldn't  we  only  require  from  councillors  to  account
quarterly and leave it at that? We have not,  through  legislation,  set  up
structures to which  we  as  parliamentarians  account  or  to  whom  school
governing bodies must account ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr W P DOMAN: Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mnu  B  M  SOLO:  Mhlalingaphambili,  siza  kuyilungisa  kancinci.   [Deputy
Chairperson, we are going to correct it a little bit.]

Deputy Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister Ntombazana Botha, hon members,  much
has been said with regard to the municipal visits and  the  report  thereon.
We have made our observation on the basis of what we heard and saw,  as  has
been indicated by the various speakers here. In line, of  course,  with  our
resolve, we say: The  people  shall  govern.  Therefore  municipalities  are
actually built along those lines.

For the purpose of  this  debate,  I'd  like  to  share  more  on  community
participation and on provinces. As you would  know,  municipalities  have  a
direct relationship with provinces. It  therefore  becomes  correct  to  say
that provinces should be seen in a particular way, just as  communities  are
to municipalities.

Chapter 2, section 2(ii) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act  has
a specific definition of municipalities. Municipalities serve the  interests
and run programmes of the community. If then the  community  does  not  play
its role, what would inform municipalities? In short, we  have  to  look  at
community participation as a critical  component  of  the  municipality,  as
spelt out in Chapter 4 of the same Act.

Esikubonileyo thina, esikungqinayo  nesikuvileyo  kukuba  oomasipala  banazo
zonke ezi ziseko, kwaye siyafumanisa ukuba uluntu  luyayithabatha  inxaxheba
yalo, nto leyo esiyikhuthazayo. Kwanga oko kungaqhubela phambili.

Uninzi lwaba masipala basebenzisa kakhulu le nto siyibiza ngokuba  ziikomiti
zeewadi. Abanye banamaphulo,  afana  nokuba  oosodolophu  bathethe  nabantu,
njalo njalo. Njengokuba sele  nditshilo,  nabantu  banayo  inxaxheba  abathi
bayithabathe ngokuthi bakhuthaze aba masipala ukuba benze umsebenzi wabo.

Kukho nto ekhe yavezwa ngomnye umasipala,  ethi  abantu  beza  nje  nee-wish
list. Kuyasivuyisa ke oko ngoba  sifumanisa  ukuba  ngenene  abantu  bayile,
bayitsho le nto bayifunayo. Kodwa singathanda ukutsho  kumagosa  ukuba  nawo
mawabhinqele phezulu, azimamele izinto ezithethwa ngabantu, angacingi  ukuba
beza nee-wish list kuba ezo ziimfuno zabantu ngale ndlela  bafuna  ukuzibona
zisenzeka ngayo.

Andizi kuba mde kakhulu, ndiza kuba mfutshane, kuba ingxelo ikubeka  elubala
ukuba kusekho iingxaki apha naphaya. Ezo ke thina  sizibona  njengeengxakana
zokukhula, izinto ezingalungiswa ngokuhamba kwexesha.

Ngoko kuyafumaniseka ukuba ngokwenene le ndlela nale  nkqubo  intsha  ikhoyo
yoomasipala noko  izinzile,  ifikile  ebantwini.  Ekufuneka  sikwenze  thina
kukukhuthaza nokuqinisekisa ukuba sithabatha inxaxheba.

Kukhona  ekukhe  kwatshiwo   ngamanye   amalungu,   ngakumbi   udade   wethu
uSouthgate,  othe  makupheliswe  inkqubo   yoosodolophu   abaziwa   njengee-
executive  mayor  neekomiti  zoosodolophu.  Masilungise  le  ndawana,  ayizo
komiti ezilawulayo, ziikomiti zoosodolophu, ukuze xa sifunda  isilungu  esi,
sisiqonde.

Kwakhona, eli lungu lithi masiphelise amabhunga ezithili. Andazi ke kuba  le
nto  ikuMgaqo-siseko.  Kwaye  kwinkomfa  ye-ANC  ebikho  kunyaka  ophelileyo
ooceba baye bawavuma amabhunga ezithili.  Mhlawumbi  kufuneka  aqonde  ukuba
kungani kukho amabhunga ezithili. Andifuni kungena kakhulu ke kulo mba  kuba
eli lungu lisekomitini, lilo ebakufanele ukuba libe liyazi  ngcono  le  nto.
Liyazi ukuba kukho oomasipala abangenakholo lokuba bazimele, nangona  kudala
bekho. Ngenxa yokuba sifuna ukugqala, siphuhlise abo  masipala  ze  sabelane
ngeziseko nezimvo, kancinane nje, sinoomasipala bezithili.

UTata uDoman uyandothusa. Kodwa ke andimangali  kuba  naku  sele  elishiyile
elinye iqela  waya  kungena  phaya.  Ngathi  akayanga  yokwakha  phaya,  uye
kumosha. EbeliLungu lesiGqeba esiLawulayo eNtshona Koloni.  Bayakhala  phaya
eGeorge ngoba yena woyisakala ukuqinisekisa ukuba  amasebe,  ngakumbi  iSebe
lezeMpilo ebebeliphethe nela  lakhe,  ayazihlawulela  iinkonzo  zikamasipala
kwaneerhafu. Zange enze  nto  ngoko.  Wavela  nje  wabukela  abantu  bakuthi
bezihluphekela.

Esikonwabeleyo, ngakumbi eNtshona Koloni, kukuba  sifumane  amagosa  esithi:
``Le nkqubo nize nayo, thina siyayibona,  intle  kakhulu.''  Ngaphandle  nje
kwala masipala wabo wase-George.  Kodwa  umasipala  wesithili  ucula  elinye
iculo. Uthi sisebenza kakuhle kakhulu. Kwaye siyambona  laa  masipala  ukuba
usadla ngendebe endala.

Zikhona  ke   izinto   ekusafuneka   sizilungise,   ekungekho   kwam   ukuba
ndiziphendule neziza kuphendulwa nguSekela Mphathiswa. Kodwa ndicinga  ukuba
sisendleleni ebheka phambili, kwaye siyakhuthala kukubona abantu  bethabatha
inxaxheba. Singathanda ukubona  namalungu  ePalamente  ethabatha  inxaxheba,
kwanamanye amaqela ngokunjalo.

Siyabulela  kuba  amaqela  amaninzi  ayahambisana  nale  ngxelo,   eyamkela.
Iziphene ezikhoyo ezithe zavezwa apha, zikhona kwaye zibhaliwe  kule  ngxelo
ukuze sibone ukuba siyazilungisa. Ezo zinto  ke  siya  kuzilungisa  ngokuthi
sisebenzisane sisonke ukuze sikwazi ukwakha uMzantsi Afrika  olungele  wonke
umntu, njengoko sisithi:  (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[What we have seen, that which we attest to and what we have heard, is  that
municipalities do have all the support systems, and we also  find  that  the
community also plays its role, which we encourage. My wish is that  it  will
make progress.

Most of these municipalities make use of what we call  ``ward  committees''.
Others have campaigns like those through which mayors talk to  people,  etc.
As I have said, others also play a part by encouraging these  municipalities
to do their work.

There was something which was raised by a municipality, to the  effect  that
``people just bring wish lists''. That makes us happy because we find  that,
indeed, people go and state what they want. However, we would  like  to  say
to the officials that they, too, must be ready and  listen  to  what  people
say, and they must not think that  people  come  with  wish  lists,  because
those are the needs of the  people,  and  they  are  also  illustrating  the
manner in which they would like to realise the responses to them.

I am not going to be too long in delivering my  speech  because  the  report
states clearly that there are problems here and  there.  We  view  those  as
teething problems which can be rectified as time goes by.

The current new procedure of municipalities is indeed  found  to  be  stable
and has reached the people. What we need to  do,  is  to  encourage  and  to
ensure that we participate.

There's something that was mentioned  by  members,  particularly  my  sister
Southgate, who said that the  system  of  mayors  who  are  referred  to  as
``executive mayors'' and the committees of mayors should be scrapped.  Let's
correct this small part.  They  are  not  committees  that  rule.  They  are
committees of mayors, so that when we learn  the  English  language  we  can
understand it.

Furthermore, this member says that we must abolish district  councils.  Then
I don't know, because this is  in  the  Constitution,  and  at  last  year's
conference of the ANC councillors  accepted  district  councils.  Maybe  the
member needs to know why there are district councils. I don't want to  delve
deeply into that matter,  because  this  is  a  member  who  serves  on  the
committee. The member is supposed to be better informed on this matter.  The
member knows that there are municipalities that  do  not  believe  in  being
independent in spite of being in existence for a long time. As a  result  of
the fact that we want to focus on and develop such municipalities so  as  to
share resources and ideas, just a little bit, we have district councils.

Papa Doman surprises me. However, I am not complaining, because here he  is,
leaving one party to join the other side. He does not seem to go  there  for
the purpose of building, but to mess things up.  He  was  a  member  of  the
executive in the ruling party of the Western Cape. They are  complaining  in
George because he  failed  to  ensure  that  the  departments,  particularly
health and the one that is his own responsibility, pay for the  services  of
the municipality, as well as their rates. He never did anything about  that.
He simply admired watching our people experiencing poverty.

What makes us happy, especially in  the  Western  Cape,  is  that  we  found
officials to whom we say, ``We can see the procedure which you have come  up
with. It is very beautiful, except for just that municipality of  theirs  in
George''. However, the district municipality  sings  a  different  song.  It
says: ``We are working very well, and we see that  that  municipality  still
employs primitive methods''.

There are some things we need to respond to, things that are not part of  my
responsibility, but will be replied to  by  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology. However, I think that we are  on  the  road
to success, and we are encouraged  when  we  see  people  participating.  We
would like to see members of Parliament and other parties participating,  as
well.

We are grateful because parties  are  in  agreement  with  this  report  and
accept it. Faults that are there and that  have  been  highlighted  here  do
exist and have been recorded in this report so that we will see to  it  that
we rectify them. We are going to correct those things by way of  all  of  us
co-operating so as to be able to build a South Africa that suits  everybody,
in line with the slogan: ``South Africa belongs to all of us''.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

South Africa belongs to all of us. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Ek sal  hom  vertel
van die Oos-Kaap en van beter dinge wat nou daar gebeur. [I shall  tell  him
about the Eastern Cape and better things that are happening there now.]

Chairperson, first of all, I would like to say that  I  have  listened  very
carefully to the comments made by the hon members. The discussion  has  been
very stimulating and thought-provoking, and I would like to  thank  all  the
members who participated in this debate today.

The Ministry and the Department for  Provincial  and  Local  Government  has
studied the report and all the comments and  the  proposals  that  are  made
today have been noted and will be considered. Of  that  I  can  assure  you.
This report will greatly enrich the future deliberations  around  these  and
other issues that have been raised, at both the political  and  departmental
levels.

I understand that the tour was the  first  of  its  kind  by  the  portfolio
committee. This was certainly not an easy task. The task that the  portfolio
committee  undertook,  as  the  hon  chairperson  said,   of   visiting   41
municipalities and effectively interacting with 2 200 people in 10  days  is
commendable  and  we  congratulate  the  committee  for  a  job  well  done.
[Applause.]

It is regrettable, however, that parties such as the  NA,  hon  Cassie,  the
IFP, the UCDP and the  FF  have  not  been  able  to  go  on  this  tour  to
experience first-hand and understand the challenges  that  local  government
faces and to be able to give genuine support in the local government, to  be
there  with  the  people  and  support   them   during   this   process   of
transformation. That is regrettable. [Interjections.]

Volgende keer, ja, Cassie. [Next time, yes, Cassie.]

We value the work that has gone into this study of the  portfolio  committee
and we find this very informative and useful. We would also  like  to  thank
the parties that took part in the  process,  especially  the  municipalities
who participated so openly and directly voiced their concerns. The  Ministry
and the department will do everything they can to ensure that this  momentum
is sustained and the debates are kept alive.

We would like to express our sincere appreciation to  all  the  members  who
went on this study tour, and particularly also thank the  secretary  of  the
portfolio committee, Mr Llewellyn Brown, who worked so hard. [Applause.]

Once again, the committee has demonstrated the importance of  its  oversight
role  and  also  its  commitment   to   advancing   the   local   government
transformation programme. This report  has  been  very  encouraging  and  it
strengthens our common purpose and determination to make sure that this  new
system of local government works.

Now, the Government has in fact been dealing with some of  the  issues  that
have been raised. For example, people mentioned municipal finances.  Let  me
say we  have  been  wrestling  with  those:  the  provision  of  free  basic
services; the functioning of  the  ward  committees;  capacity-building  and
training; the role of  traditional  leaders;  the  division  of  powers  and
functions  between  the  B's  and  the   C's,   the   district   and   local
municipalities;  integrated  governance   and   planning;   the   role   and
functioning of Salga; corruption; the delivery of services; and  the  review
and analysis of the impact of local government policies.
Unfortunately, we  cannot  do  that  today.  We  cannot  give  comprehensive
responses to all the issues that have been raised. Suffice it to  say  today
that we agree wholeheartedly with the committee's  assertion  which  appears
in 17.2 of the report, which the  chairperson  mentioned  earlier,  on  what
emerges from the study, and I quote:


  The challenges of the new system  of  local  government  are  not  around
  conceptual and policy issues, but implementation issues.

We agree with that. Now, perhaps what I can say  is  that  the  findings  of
this  study  tour  confirm  what  we  have  previously  discussed   in   the
President's Co-ordinating Council, and members will remember  that  we  have
mentioned it frequently  in  debates,  that  we  started  off  by  having  a
workshop on 14 December 2001 where we discussed local government. What  came
out of that workshop were five strategic  objectives,  and  maybe  I  should
mention those again: building a strong local government sphere  and  further
enhancing its status within  a  stable  co-operative  governance  framework;
building  stable  institutional  and   administrative   systems   of   local
government;  deepening  local  democracy  and  accountability;  accelerating
service delivery and economic development, and building  financially  viable
local government.

Those  issues  that  were  raised  then  are   the   issues   perhaps   that
municipalities are  wrestling  with,  and  we  agreed  at  the  PCC  on  the
monitoring and the implementation of  these  resolutions.  Since  then,  for
almost the whole of last year, we  have  been  visiting  the  provinces  and
holding workshops in the provinces to try  and  address  these  issues.  The
outcome of  those  conferences  is  an  action  plan  based  on  those  five
resolutions and this has since been developed.

So, what I am trying to say is that we have  been  doing  something,  and  I
hope that what  the  hon  Doman  said  about  municipalities  being  totally
confused is really not correct. The report does not say that  municipalities
are totally confused. What is perhaps true is what the  hon  Solo  said.  He
may be correct when he says that the  hon  Doman  may  be  totally  confused
himself.

What I thought was that maybe we should talk about  this  issue  that  arose
continuously, particularly from the side of the members  of  the  DA,  about
the powers and functions of the district municipalities as  opposed  to  the
local  municipalities,  and  also  about  whether  we   do   need   district
municipalities. Maybe I must thank hon Smith for pointing this out. He  said
they do understand the reason for the existence of district  municipalities.
I am hoping that in your alliance, hon Smith, between the IFP  and  DA,  you
would actually try and explain to the DA why we decided on  having  district
municipalities. [Interjections.]

I  hope  that  the  DA  will   understand   that   the   categorisation   of
municipalities as local, district and metros is an important feature of  our
new system of developmental local government.  We  should  not  conveniently
seek to undermine the legacy of the past,  which  has  left  us  with  gross
social and economic inequalities throughout  the  country.  A  system  which
does not take this reality into consideration would be void of  realism  and
acknowledgement of the need for reconstruction and development.

So, whilst there seems to be convergence on the need to develop capacity  in
municipalities, we should equally recognise the need to  build  capacity  in
the district municipalities so they too can play a supportive role.

To the hon Grobler, it is not correct to view the role of provinces as  only
limited to payment of rates and taxes. [Interjections.]  Perhaps  we  should
go back to our Constitution. Provinces  represent  a  sphere  of  government
which is integral to intergovermental  planning,  budgeting,  implementation
and monitoring. This is the  context  within  which  we  are  continuing  to
develop a stable and  predictable  system  of  intergovernmental  relations.
[Interjections.]

Hulle wil mos nie luister nie. Luister asseblief  tog.  Ons  gaan  julle  'n
bietjie iets leer. [Tussenwerpsels.] [They do not  want  to  listen.  Please
listen. We are going to teach you something. [Interjections.]]

In relation to local government, finance and  equitable  share,  as  members
would be aware, the allocation of  resources  through  the  equitable  share
formula continues to receive vigorous reviewing  and  interaction  annually.
We will continue to work closely with the Financial and  Fiscal  Commission,
the FFC, and the Treasury to  address  these  matters  of  intergovernmental
fiscal relations.

Regarding what was raised by the hon Smith about traditional  leadership,  I
am sure that members  are  aware  that  our  Ministry  and  Department  have
conducted extensive consultations on the White Paper,  and  I  think  people
should reading that White Paper. It is important so  that  we  do  not  just
come here and say things, but I will address that point at another time.

May I also just inform the members regarding  the  Municipal  Infrastructure
Grant? You will remember that  Cabinet  decided  to  bring  all  the  grants
together into what we now  call  the  Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant.  The
department has received a mandate from  Cabinet  to  consolidate  all  these
grants by 2005-06. We have already started to implement  a  pilot  programme
in this regard, and we will focus on the municipal infrastructure that  will
facilitate the provision of basic services.

Our particular emphasis, together with the Department of Public Works,  will
be on labour-intensive construction methods, training and accreditation  and
on job creation.

In conclusion, I would just like to say that at the  core  of  making  local
government effective is the issue of community participation and  IDPs,  and
the way ward committees function is important. In June we will be hosting  a
conference on ward committees. We will invite all MECs on local  government,
the speakers of municipalities, NGOs and CBOs, and the  hon  Doman  is  also
invited. In this manner, municipalities needing special  attention  will  be
dealt with, and this issue was also raised in the report.

Once again, we would like to thank the portfolio  committee  for  this  work
and encourage them to undertake  such  visits  frequently.  Even  next  year
there is the intention of visiting the nodes and we welcome that.  You  will
remember that the NCOP also visited rural and urban nodes last year, and  we
are also acting on their report, but it is good when the reviewing  of  this
happens frequently. It also keeps us on our toes.

Perhaps in the next visit, the portfolio committee  should  actually  invite
more members of Parliament to participate in those visits.  [Interjections.]
The problem that we might also want to look at is  how  we  communicate  the
work that Government and Parliament do to the municipalities. That  is  also
very important.

Lastly, I would just like to quote the President in his state of the  nation
address in 2002 when he said:
  The central question we would have to answer at the end  of  the  day  is
  whether what we are doing as  the  legislature,  the  executive  and  the
  judiciary, as well as civil society is helping to lift from the shoulders
  of our people the intolerable burden of poverty and underdevelopment

Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  Deputy  Minister,  when  you  are
editing your speech, you might  want  to  look  at  the  use  of  that  word
``undermine'' and you may want to replace it with ``uphold''.

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Deputy  Chairperson,  I  move
that the House notes the report.

Agreed to.

                        The House adjourned at 18:00.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report  of  the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence  on  the
     Allegations arising out of  the  Purchase  of  a  Guest  House  by  the
     Civilian Intelligence Services in Cape Town, dated 14 May 2003:


         Following media  reports  and  a  request  from  the  Minister  for
         Intelligence Services in March 2003, the Joint  Standing  Committee
         on  Intelligence,  having  considered  the  matter  concerning  the
         guesthouse in Cape Town, reports as follows:  The  Committee  noted
         with regret that a Member of Parliament, particularly one  who  has
         access to intelligence oversight through its representative on  the
         Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, had  not  only  disclosed
         the exact location of the house, but also paraded in  front  of  it
         whilst journalists took photographs. The Committee is  particularly
         concerned about the insensitive and partisan  way  of  handling  an
         issue  of  national  security,  despite  several  avenues  at   the
         disposal of both the public representative and  the  South  African
         public.


         Flowing from the media reports the following concerns were raised:


         1.  Was  there  a  need  for  such  a  secured  facility  for   the
            intelligence services?


         2. Why was the property registered in  the  name  of  the  National
            Intelligence Agency or should it  have  been  registered  in  a
            covert manner?


         3. Was the purchase price market related?


         The Committee  considered  these  matters  and  having  received  a
         briefing from the Ministry and the  National  Intelligence  Agency,
         made the following findings:


         1. The Committee agreed that there is a need for  a  secure  shared
              facility for the  intelligence  services  and  other  relevant
              government departments in Cape Town for the following reasons:


              i.   The  continued   involvement   of   the   South   African
                     intelligence community in support of the Government in
                     the  resolution  of  conflicts,  both  internally  and
                     internationally.


              ii. Cape Town is the seat of Parliament and often there  is  a
                     need for urgent consultation between the executive and
                     other parties during parliamentary sessions.


              iii.     The cosmopolitan nature of  the  city  of  Cape  Town
                     lends itself to the opportunity  for  the  need  of  a
                     discreet facility for the use  of  the  South  African
                     government.


              iv. Public places such as hotels are  sometimes  inappropriate
                     for meetings of this nature because of the exposure of
                     participants and/or the  security  measures  necessary
                     for such meetings. This may infringe on the rights  of
                     other users of such public places.


              v.  It is in keeping with  international  best  practices  for
                     intelligence services to own such properties.


         2. The registration of the property under the name of the  National
              Intelligence Agency does not constitute any breach of  policy.
              It is in line with  the  current  policy  of  ensuring  proper
              registration of the assets of the state. This type of facility
              must not be confused with what is commonly referred  to  as  a
              "safe house", which is covert.


         3. From the information at  the  disposal  of  the  Committee,  the
              Committee found that the purchase price was in line  with  the
              current property prices of  a  similar  nature  and  location.
              These prices range from R5,6M to R10,8M. No information to the
              contrary was brought to the attention of the Committee.


         The Committee resolves not to have  any  further  investigation  on
         the  matter.  However,   this   does   not   exclude   any   future
         investigation,  should  the  Auditor-General  produce  evidence  of
         irregularity.


         In view of the above, the Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence
         would like to conclude by  a  call  for  a  public  debate  on  the
         concept of national security in order to  reach  consensus  on  how
         matter of national security should be dealt with.


     Report to be considered.

     Letter received from the South African Human Rights Commission dated  3
     April 2003, addressed to the  Speaker  on  the  implementation  of  the
     Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000 (Act No 2 of 2000):


     Dear Dr Ginwala


     Re: Implementation of the Promotion of Access to Information Act
     The Promotion of Access to Information Act No 2 of 2000 (hereafter, the
     Act) which came into operation on  9  May  2001,  given  to  the  South
     African Human Rights Commission (hereafter, the Commission) a  host  of
     responsibilities including monitoring and reporting. The Commission has
     encountered and continues to encounter problems with many public bodies
     in so far as their  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Act  is
     concerned.


     Section 32 of the Act  requires  information  officers  of  all  public
     bodies as defined in section 1 of the Act, to annually  submit  to  the
     Commission, reports pertaining to requests for access  to  records  and
     how the respective public bodies have dealt with such requests.


     The first anniversary of the submission of section 32 reports was 9 May
     2002 and the second anniversary 9 May 2003. The response rate for  more
     than 800 public bodies has been poor in both anneversaries,  with  less
     than 20 public bodies responding in 2002 and less  than  15  for  2003.
     This, despite numerous efforts by the Commission to inform  and  remind
     public bodies of their obligations in terms of the  Act.  In  2002  the
     Commission held briefings for public  bodies  in  eight  provinces  and
     placed a notice on its website in order to impress on public bodies the
     need to comply with this obligation. This year  the  Commission,  at  a
     cost of R 80 000 of public funds, placed adverts in several newspapers,
     reminding public bodies to submit their section  32  reports  by  March
     2003.


     While the Act does not provide for sanctions  for  non-compliance  with
     the provisions of section 32, the South African Human Rights Commission
     Act 54 of  1994  makes  it  a  criminal  offence  for  any  person  who
     frustrates the work of the Commission.


     The Commission does not readily resort to drastic measures in order  to
     ensure compliance with obligations  pertaining  to  its  functions  and
     powers, but we resort  to  these  measures  where  we  have  to.  These
     measures include powers  of  subpoena  and  referral  to  the  National
     Director of Public Prosecutions.


     We therefore request your political intervention in this regard as part
     of Parliament's overall monitoring role, and also await the  submission
     of your office's section 32 report, which the  Commission  has  yet  to
     receive.


     Yours sincerely


     Mr Jody Kollapen
     Chairperson


     Referred to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development for consideration and report.

     Background


     On 15 May 2003, the Office of  the  Registrar  received  correspondence
     from Minister Lekota in which he tendered an apology to Parliament  for
     his non-disclosure of financial interests. The letter also gave details
     of his interests in BZL Petroleum CC 1169 and BZL Petroleum CC 1209.


     On 16 May 2003, the Mail and Guardian newspaper published an article on
     the non-disclosure of  financial  interests  by  Minister  Lekota.  The
     article refers to non-disclosure of BZL Petroleum as well  as  Minister
     Lekota's directorship in both Landzicht and Griekwaland-Wes  Koöperasie
     (GWK).


     On the same day Minister Lekota submitted  details  pertaining  to  his
     directorships of Landzicht and GWK. Minister Lekota explained  that  he
     acquired his directorship of GWK in October 2002 and therefore in terms
     of the rules is only required to disclose it in the 2003 disclosure.


     Mr D M Gibson, MP, submitted a complaint on 16 May 2003  regarding  the
     Minister's non-disclosure.


     On 16 May 2003 the Minister was advised of the complaint, and asked  to
     furnish full details of his interests.


     Minister Lekota's disclosure.
     The Minister complied with the request to  disclose  and  provided  the
     following additions to his existing disclosures:


     1999
     Residential property - Bloemfontein
     Residential property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investments
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of Trustees


     2000
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of Trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body


     2001
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Directorship - Landzicht Winery
     Shares - BZL Petroleum 1169 CC
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body


     2002
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Directorship - Landzicht Winery
     Shares - BZL Petroleum 1169 CC
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body


     The Minister's directorships, as forwarded, were found to be consistent
     with search results of the Department of Trade  and  Industry  -  CIPRO
     Website.


     Breaches of the Code
     Item 16 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that a  member  breaches  the
     Code if a member -


         (a)     Contravenes or fails to comply  with  a  provision  of  the
              Code,
         (b)     When disclosing registrable interests,  willfully  provides
              the Registrar with incorrect or misleading details.


     Consideration of the complaint.
     Minister Lekota has publicly conceded that he  has  not  disclosed  the
     aforementioned interests. A hearing is not required because  the  facts
     are not in dispute.  However,  the  Committee  must  establish  whether
     Minister Lekota's non-disclosure was due to negligence  or  whether  he
     intended to willfully mislead the Committee.


     Item 3.3 of the Procedure for the Investigation  of  Complaints  allow,
     "in each case the committee has the discretion regarding the weight  to
     be attached to different forms of evidence..."


     The Committee agreed that it  must  make  a  finding  of  willful  non-
     disclosure if it is found that the Minister or his family,  friends  or
     associates improperly benefited financially or otherwise from his  non-
     disclosure. The Committee must assess whether the non-disclosure  arose
     to conceal a conflict of interest.


     In terms of the criteria outlined above, consideration must be given to
     the Mail and Guardian's  analysis  of  the  conflict  of  interests  in
     respect of this matter. The report states that "Lekota's involvement in
     the businesses raise serious conflict of interests questions as  Lekota
     is in the position to use his influence and has  access  to  privileged
     information that could advance his business interests."  The  newspaper
     continues " the fact that BZL is a distribution agency  of  Caltex  and
     the fact that Lekota is  a  shareholder  of  BZL  arguably  brings  him
     uncomfortably close to the petroleum giant. In this case  the  conflict
     of interest arises from the fact that Lekota sits in  Cabinet  meetings
     that make decisions that affect fuel companies."


     With the information at hand, it  is  the  Committee's  view  that  the
     newspaper does not make a case that  there  is  a  direct  conflict  of
     interest. Further, there is  no  evidence  before  the  Committee  that
     indicate that the Minister had  benefited  financially  from  his  non-
     disclosure. At most it could be said that the Minister's interest could
     create a perception of a potential conflict of interest.


     The Mail and Guardian continues, "Landzicht is a  regular  supplier  of
     wines to the Free State Government." The article also states Trade  and
     Investment South Africa paid 80% of  Landzicht's  exhibitions  held  in
     Thailand, Beijing and Uganda.


     In respect of the  Minister's  interests  in  Landzicht,  details  were
     obtained from Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA) on  the  funding
     of the exhibitions. They (TISA) have indicated that Minister Lekota was
     at no stage directly involved in dealing  with  any  application.  They
     have only a record of the exhibition in Uganda.


     Minister Lekota's Address to the Committee
     The Minister at the outset apologised for his failure to  disclose.  He
     conceded that he erred in not forwarding full details of his disclosure
     and accepts that he failed to abide with the requirements of the Code.


     In respect of  the  Minister's  non-disclosure  of  his  residences  in
     Westville and Bloemfontein, he stated that these are private residences
     and that no business activity was conducted from these premises.


     In respect of shares in BZL 1169 CC, the Minister indicated that he had
     at no time  drawn  any  benefit  and  advised  that  the  business  has
     undergone liquidation. The Minister is credited with a dividend and has
     not drawn it to date.


     In respect of BZL 1209, the Minister has a 5% share at a nominal  value
     of R5. The Minister has indicated that the company value  is  difficult
     to determine, but is not likely  to  be  significant.  He  received  no
     remuneration or benefit to date and has now  tendered  his  resignation
     from BZL Petroleum.


     With regard to Landzicht, the Minister  has  partially  disclosed  this
     interest, including the wine farm in Jacobsdal. He received no  payment
     from Landzicht. The Minister has indicated that there is no contract to
     supply wine to the government of the Free State,   as  alleged  in  the
     newspaper report.


     Griekwaland-Wes Koöperasie (GWK)
     The Minister was invited  to  serve  as  a  non-executive  director  in
     October 2002. As such he would only be required to  disclose  in  2003.
     The Minister did not receive any benefits. He tendered his  resignation
     to GWK.


     Mokolla Investments
     The Minister indicated that this is a dormant  company  and  has  never
     traded.


     Braam Fischer Board of Trustees
     This is a trust to assist rural children. He derives  no  benefit  from
     this.


     Grey College School Governing Body
     The Minister does not derive any benefits from this body.


     Based on the information at its disposal, the Committee is of the  view
     that the Minister's failure to disclose was negligent, but that he  did
     not intend to willfully mislead the Committee.


     Recommendations
     The Joint Committee makes the finding that:


         -  Minister Lekota failed to comply  with  the  provisions  of  the
              Code of Conduct with regard to financial interests;
         -  Minister Lekota was negligent in making  incomplete  disclosures
              of his interests;
         -  However, there was  no  evidence  that  the  Minister  willfully
              withheld information with the intention to mislead Parliament;
              and
         -  Therefore, sanctions his negligence.


     In terms of the provisions of the Code the Joint  Committee  on  Ethics
     and  Members'  Interests  recommends  to  the  National  Assembly   the
     following sanctions:


         (i)     a written  reprimand  from  the  Speaker  of  the  National
               Assembly; and
         (ii)    a fine which is the  equivalent  of  one  week's  (7  days)
               salary.
     In making these recommendations, the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and
     Members' Interests wishes to emphasise that Members of Parliament,   as
     elected public representatives, have an obligation  to  be  transparent
     and must take the provisions of the Code seriously.


     The  Committee  noted  the  promptness  with  which   Minister   Lekota
     responded, his own admission of casualness in regard to disclosure, and
     his cooperative demeanour.


     The Committee was unanimous in its findings.


     Adopted unanimously by the Committee on 27 May 2003.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of
     Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons on  Filling  of
     Vacancies on National Youth Commission, dated 27 May 2003:
     The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of  Life  and
     Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons, having  considered  the
     request from the Minister in The Presidency regarding  the  appointment
     of Commissioners to serve on the National Youth Commission, referred to
     it, reports as follows:


     1.     Advertisements were placed in the printed and  electronic  media
         from 2 to 17 April 2003, and the Committee received 72  nominations
         (15 females, 53 males and four disabled persons).  On  20  May  the
         Committee shortlisted the following nominees for interviews:


         Jabu Mbalula, Daniël van Vuuren, Nketu Matime,  Petronella  Linders
         (visually  impaired),  Cameron  Tabane,  Lebogang  Maile,   Vuyiswa
         Tulelo-Rathebe, Anele Matoti, Simon Zwane  (paraplegic),  Sthembele
         Peter (epilepsy) and Mpande Cele.


         On 22 May, a day before  the  interviews  were  scheduled  to  take
         place, Mpande Cele  withdrew  his  nomination,  and  the  Committee
         therefore ultimately interviewed 10 candidates.


     2.     On 23 May, the Committee spent five hours interviewing the  said
         10 candidates. The  principle  of  concurrence  with  the  National
         Council of Provinces, and the terms of reference  as  contained  in
         the National Youth Commission Act, 1996, (Act No. 19 of  1996),  as
         well as the appointment of five full-time commissioners, were  duly
         taken into account during the entire process.


     3.     The Committee accordingly recommends, in accordance with section
         4 of the National Youth Commission Act,  1996,  that  the  National
         Assembly and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  recommend  the
         following five candidates for consideration by the  President  when
         appointing  five  full-time   members   to   the   National   Youth
         Commission:
         Jabu Mbalula
         Daniël van Vuuren
         Nketu Matime
         Petronella Linders
         Vuyiswa Tulelo-Rathebe.

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Labour on Visit to  Chile,  dated
     12 November 2002:


     The Portfolio Commmittee on Labour, having conducted  a  fact-  finding
     mission to Chile from 30  September  to  4  October  2002,  reports  as
     follows:

       Procedure  C

       Findings   E
       Conclusion F


     A.     Terms of reference


         The Committee resolved  to  undertake  a  fact-finding  mission  to
         Chile. The objectives of this trip were to:


         1. Find out about compliance with labour legislation.


         2. Strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries.


         3. Share experiences on some of the issues which Chile has  managed
              to succeed in addressing, for example, reducing unemployment.


         4. Look at how Chile manages to link labour with social security.


         5. Share some experiences as countries which brought  some  reforms
              to their labour systems.


         The Committee agreed that a report would be compiled after all  the
         information had been collated and analysed.


     B.     Background


         Like South Africa, Chile attained democracy after several years  of
         dictatorship. The governments of both Chile and  South  Africa  are
         pressed by the need to attain better employment  growth  rates.  In
         addition, in both countries, labour  market  interventions  by  the
         state are constrained by fiscal discipline. Chile has succeeded  in
         reducing the  levels  of  unemployment.  Also,  social  and  labour
         policies that  had  previously  contributed  to  the  expansion  of
         internal consumption were to be redefined. The Ministry  of  Labour
         in Chile has managed to accomplish  labour  reforms  from  both  an
         economic and social perspective. All  reforms  were  a  subject  of
         debate and planning at national level and had  a  high  content  of
         social dialogue. It is against that background that  the  Committee
         resolved to undertake a fact-finding  mission  in  order  to  share
         experiences with Chile.


     C.     Procedure


         Communication on the proposed visit  was  conducted  both  verbally
         and in writing with the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  the
         South African Mission in Santiago de Chile.


         The delegation interacted with  a  wide  spectrum  of  the  Chilean
         society, which amongst others included the ministers of labour  and
         social security, government officials from the ministry of  labour,
         parliamentarians,   union    leaders,    employers    associations,
         academics, judges and management of the mining council.


     D.     Logistical arrangements


         The multi-party delegation consisted of the following persons:


         Mr D A A Olifant (Acting-Chairperson) ANC
         Mr G G Oliphant ANC
         Ms E Thabethe ANC
         Mr N J Clelland-Stokes DP
         Mr J Durand NNP
         Ms P Jayiya (Committee Secretary)


     E.     FINDINGS


         1. Ministry of labour and social security


              The ministry of labour and social security combines  both  the
              portfolio of labour and social security.  It  has  two  deputy
              ministers.  The  directorate  of  labour  is  responsible  for
              monitoring compliance with  labour  laws  and  enforcement  of
              labour law standards. The directorate of social security is in
              charge of managing the distribution of social security  funds.
              The   social   security   fund   is   administered   by    the
              superintendency of social security,  and  there  are  regional
              superintendents in all the regions.


         2. Senate of labour commission


              The Chilean parliamentary committee on labour only focuses  on
              developing norms and  standards  of  the  labour  market.  The
              judiciary and  labour  courts  are  responsible  for  settling
              labour disputes. Parliament also ensures that  legislation  is
              clear and interpreted correctly.


              The representation of women in decision-making  structures  in
              Chile is improving. There are five  women  cabinet  ministers.
              The head of the chamber (Speaker) is also a woman.  The  house
              has  12%  women,  although  only  two  serve  on  the   labour
              commission.


         3. Labour market


              Chile  has  a  total  population  of  15  million  people.   A
              significant number of the population are indigenous people who
              were ignored by government policies in the  past.  Of  the  15
              million people, 11 million are of working age. Six million are
              economically active individuals and five million are employed.
              Some 500 000 people remain unemployed. This  represents  a  9%
              unemployment rate. The labour force consists of people between
              the ages of 18 and 65.  Labour  indicators  reflect  that  the
              labour force in Chile consists of  three  million  people  who
              work in the private sector. Workers are classified: minor  18,
              domestic, pensioners, public and private.


              Women make up 37% of the Chilean labour force.  Representation
              of women has improved in the police force.  Possibilities  are
              envisaged in the army where women can become generals.


              The average remuneration is US$450 per month. Each worker  has
              an average of four years in a permanent job. The turnover rate
              per year is 25%.


              In terms of salary distribution, 70% of  the  population  earn
              less than the average salary.


              Some 80% of employment in Chile is in  the  small  and  medium
              sector and 20% in big companies. Small  and  medium  companies
              tend to be owned by people with a low level of education.


              Chile   has   a   confederation   that   represents    private
              entrepreneurs in different fields such as agriculture, mining,
              banking, transport, etc. The confederation  has  180  members,
              which is almost 9% of private entrepreneurs. However, the role
              of the confederation is to promote jobs through  its  branches
              and membership.


         4. Subsidised employment


              In Chile the  state  directly  subsidises  employment  in  the
              private sector by paying the wages of  participants  partially
              or totally, or offers tax advantages to  firms  who  hire  and
              provide work experience. The programmes of subsidised  private
              sector employment are linked to training schemes. For example,
              Chile has a programme that is co-financed  by  the  government
              and the inter-American Development bank. This programme is co-
              ordinated by  the  state  unit  and  is  run  through  private
              institutes. It is mainly targeted  at  the  young  unemployed,
              preferably between the ages of 15 and 24, who are out  of  the
              schooling system. This programme has a number of subprogrammes
              - training and work experience  in  firms,  work  training  to
              become self-employed and training for young workers.  Most  of
              the training programmes are geared towards  producing  skilled
              labour, especially for private sector demands.


         5. Labour flexibility/adaptability


              Chileans believe that the labour market should be flexible for
              the economy in order to create  more  job  opportunities,  and
              that the market should determine labour legislation.
              One labour specialist expressed the view that Chile uses terms
              such as adaptability and modernity because labour  flexibility
              solicits a strong reaction from the trade unions. He  gave  an
              example of countries such as  South  Korea  which,  after  the
              Asian crisis, was experiencing high  unemployment,  but  after
              implementing labour flexibility, jobs were created.


              The labour reforms passed have no obligation to  make  minimum
              working hours flexible.


         6. Unions/workers rights


              One of the benefits of the Chilean Labour Reform Act  of  2001
              is that it allows for the formation  of  multi-industry  trade
              unions. It also recognises the rights of workers  to  organise
              themselves in  a  manner  that  benefits  their  interests.  A
              general rule in the formation of a union requires a minimum of
              25  workers  in  the  workforce.  However,  a   special   norm
              established is that eight workers can form a labour  union  in
              companies with less than 50 workers, on the understanding that
              within one year the quota required by  law  is  fulfilled.  In
              companies with less than 50 workers, the requirement is 10% of
              the total workforce.


              The Labour Reform Act also prohibits employers from using scab
              labour  during  strikes  and  dismissals  because   of   union
              involvement. It further obliges employers  to  provide  unions
              with a policy and financial statements,  as  well  as  company
              objectives,   projections   and   planned   technological   or
              organisational changes.


              As from 1 January 2005, normal  working  hours  will  decrease
              from 48 to 45 hours per week. For example, in the catering and
              commercial industries, workers will be entitled  to  two  free
              Sundays a month, while workers in the fishing industry will be
              entitled to 12 instead of 10 hours leisure time.


              Overtime will only be used for temporary needs,  and  must  be
              agreed on in writing for a  maximum  of  three  months,  after
              which it must be renewed.


              Studies conducted by researchers indicated that although  some
              rights of workers  have  been  re-established,  95%  of  women
              workers are ignorant of their rights.  This  results  in  them
              being exploited.


              Although unions' autonomy  has  been  increased,  they  remain
              weak. One of the senators expressed  the  view  that  workers'
              rights are best  served  by  workers  themselves  through  the
              vigilance of trade unions, and that, although legislation  can
              be passed, if unions are weak, they are useless.


              Recent  studies  conducted  by  CENDA,  an  institution  which
              conducts studies on  workers  rights  and  training  of  trade
              unions,  identified  some  deficiencies  in  the  salaries  of
              workers that are employed in the  agricultural  sector.  CENDA
              has made a commitment to work together with the unions and the
              ministry of labour to ensure that all conditions are  captured
              in the new law.


              CENDA also  conducted  research  in  respect  of  the  fishing
              industry. The findings were that  when  workers  put  in  more
              working hours, they are paid overtime. Excessive working hours
              affect the health conditions of all workers.


         7. Law enforcement
              As indicated, the directorate of  labour  is  responsible  for
              monitoring compliance with the labour laws.  This  directorate
              has a staff complement of 1 600 public servants, and  each  of
              the 13 regions has a director. Also, there  are  78  inspector
              offices throughout the country. It is envisaged  that  by  the
              end  of  2004  almost  2  000  posts  will  be   filled.   The
              responsibilities of the  directorate  of  labour  include  the
              following:


              (a) Monitoring the collective bargaining process.


              (b) Enforcement of compliance with labour standards.


              (c) Conduct studies on phenomenal processes that emerge in the
                  labour market.


              (d) The legal unit (within this directorate)  is  composed  of
                  lawyers who are responsible for interpreting the law.  The
                  lawyers also carry out defence of the  institution  before
                  the court when a sanction has been approved.


              (e) They  resolve  conflicts,  be  it  individual  or  through
                  collective bargaining.


              (f)  The  mediation  unit  specialises  in  conciliation   and
                  mediation at no cost.


              (g)  Training  of  union  leaders  forms  part  of  the  daily
                  activities of the department.


         8. Training


              Most  of  the  training  programmes  are  carried  out  within
              companies, with tax incentives. For Chile training  is  linked
              with education and labour. Almost 20% of the labour force will
              be trained once a year within a period of five years, with  an
              emphasis  on  subjects  such  as   English   and   Information
              Technology.


              In Chile most companies prefer not to have disabled people  on
              the workforce. This is seen as a cultural problem.


         9. President's social programme


              (a) Poverty alleviation


                  On  20  June  2002  the  Chilean  President  announced   a
                  "Solidarity Chile" project. This programme has  a  set  of
                  policies that are oriented to the poor sector  of  people.
                  This  project  is  aimed  at  assisting  56  000  indigent
                  families in Chile. All programmes  that  are  attached  to
                  this project will start operating in  November  2002,  and
                  will include the following elements:


                  *    Personalised psycho-social  support  for  24  months,
                       with the provision of a bonus for family  protection,
                       starting at US$15 per month.


                  *    Provision of guaranteed subsidies for family  members
                       under 18,  and  senior  members  to  have  access  to
                       health, housing and education.


                  *    Training and labour inspection programmes.


                  *     Labour  and  provisional  benefits  for   unemployed
                       family heads.


                  *    10 000 houses will  be  built  at  the  beginning  of
                       2003.
                  *    The state in partnership with the private sector  and
                       NGOs will offer daily programmes that will allow  for
                       hiring of people in real jobs. These people  will  be
                       assisted in finding jobs in the private sector.


              (b) Education


                  The President has announced his intention  to  reform  the
                  current system of education. This will include  increasing
                  school hours.  Families  who  already  have  an  education
                  savings  account,  will  be  rewarded  by  the  state   by
                  receiving the equivalent of the  accumulated  interest  or
                  even  double  that,  depending  on  the  family's  income.
                  University scholarships  and  loans  would  be  increased.
                  There  will  be  a  12-year  compulsory  school  education
                  system.


                  Child labour is not a  problematic  issue  in  Chile.  The
                  country has a strong policy which prevents this.


         2. Social security: Pensions and other employee benefits


              Chilean Social Security gives benefits to the poor section  of
              the population. In terms of the UN  Human  Development  Index,
              Chile was  placed  in  a  favourable  position,  although  the
              country still occupies a low position in terms of distribution
              of income.


              The social security indicators show that  in  2000  the  total
              working contributors was 278 254. It is estimated that by 2009
              non-working contributors will amount to 985 190.


              (a) Pension System


                  The  old  Chilean  pension  system   had   a   series   of
                  difficulties which had to be resolved in order to  achieve
                  reform.  Among  these  was  that   that   system   had   a
                  multiplicity of pension agencies with their own  different
                  systems, which in turn offered different  benefits.  Hence
                  it was necessary  to  introduce  reforms  which  would  be
                  uniform and rationalise the ruling system.


                  The old system was administered  by  a  government  entity
                  and provided health and other  social  security  benefits.
                  Employers  were  obliged  to  withhold  a  certain   fixed
                  percentage of the total remuneration and pay it  into  the
                  pension fund.


                  The new private pension system established in 1980 is  for
                  workers who have joined  the  labour  market  since  then.
                  Worker contributions are also subtracted from monthly  pay
                  cheques at a fixed  percentage.  Currently,  almost  three
                  million workers contribute  to  the  new  private  pension
                  system.


                  However, there are still 870 000 pensioners from  the  old
                  system, 200 000 of whom are active. They are  seen  as  an
                  important part of the country's labour force.


              (b) Health care benefits


                  In Chile  a  worker  or  self-employed  individual  has  a
                  mandatory contribution of  7%  towards  health  insurance.
                  Labour  health  has  a  system  that   is   enforced   and
                  registered by the Superintendency of Social Security.


                  Companies may choose to insure  their  workers  under  two
                  alternative schemes,  namely  mutual  insurance  companies
                  for workers or the delegated system of administration.


                  Mutual  insurance  companies  are   non-profit   entities,
                  financed through legally defined contributions, for  which
                  the employer is responsible.  The  basic  contribution  is
                  0,9% of worker wages.


                  Companies with 2 000 workers and more,  with  capital  and
                  reserves above 7 000  vital  annual  salaries,  and  which
                  meet the requirements set  by  law,  are  entitled  to  be
                  named  delegate  administrators  of  the  insurance.   The
                  number of workers covered by this scheme is  almost  0,72%
                  of the labour force.


                  The State offers another alternative for labour  accidents
                  and  professional  illnesses.  This  is  aimed  at   small
                  business enterprises and domestic workers. The  regulation
                  and supervision of  the  institutions  which  manage  this
                  programme is a  task  of  the  Superintendency  of  Social
                  Security.


         3. Work-related accidents


              All employees have to pay  a  0,95%  premium  on  remuneration
              towards workmen's compensation. Such funds go to the system in
              which they participate.


         4. Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF)


              As from 1 October 2002, an obligatory  unemployment  insurance
              fund has been established. These funds remunerate workers  who
              have been laid off. The  UIF  operates  on  a  combination  of
              individual account per employee (savings) and  the  solidarity
              fund.


              (a) Features of UIF


                  *    All resources will be imbursed in the capital  market
                       at a fixed rate.


                  *    Increased growth for internal savings.


                  *    Temporary workers are included.


                  *    Automatic incorporation of all employees who  started
                       working since enforcement of the law.


                  *    It is optional  for  workers  with  older  contracts.
                       This is done according to the employee's decision.


              (b) Individual accounts


                  With an individual account, the employer contributes  1,6%
                  and the employee 0,6% of his or  her  salary  towards  the
                  account.  Benefits  depend  on  the   savings   level   or
                  resources accumulated and are always granted.  This  is  a
                  savings account of the worker, where he or she earns  5-6%
                  interest at  a  fixed  rate.  Benefits  in  this  type  of
                  account are paid in up to  five  decreasing  amounts.  The
                  number depends on the period of contribution.


              (c) Solidarity fund


                  The  fund  acts  as  a  complement   to   the   employee's
                  individual account once resources are finished.  In  terms
                  of this fund, the employer contributes 2,4% to the  salary
                  of each employee. The  2,4%  is  divided  -  1,6%  to  the
                  individual account and 0,8% to the  solidarity  fund.  The
                  employer is obliged to save this 2,4% for private  workers
                  only.


                  In the case of dismissal,  the  worker  can  apply  for  a
                  warranty amount  from  the  solidarity  fund.  The  latter
                  grants  five  decreasing  withdrawals,  and  has   limited
                  access, i.e twice every five years. The  general  rule  is
                  that if a worker is fired, there are 12 contributions.  He
                  or she can apply to the solidarity fund for 50% of his  or
                  her last salary.


              (d) Administration of UIF


                  The  UIF  in  Chile   is   administered   by   a   private
                  administrator. This is done with efficiency,  and  without
                  corruption and political influence. It  is  handled  by  a
                  sole operator and is granted for a fixed period.


                  The selection of the  administrator  was  done  through  a
                  tender process  -  compensation  associations,  banks  and
                  insurance companies could participate. However,  selection
                  was based on the  quality  of  the  offer  in  respect  of
                  financial, technical and economical  aspects.  The  winner
                  of the bid offered 6,6% per year and 0,5% per  month.  The
                  administration contract will  last  for  a  period  of  10
                  years.


              (e) Severance indemnity payments


                  Chilean  labour  law  provides  for  severance   indemnity
                  payable to workers if they are dismissed for reason  other
                  than serious misconduct. The benefit is equivalent to  one
                  month's salary for each year of service, for a maximum  of
                  11 months. It is based on the  worker's  most  recent  pay
                  level.


                  The  possibility  of  dismissal  without  cause  has  been
                  eliminated. Workers may be dismissed due to  modernisation
                  and economic needs of the company. Also,  workers  may  be
                  dismissed if they are  considered  not  suitable  for  the
                  job's requirements. In such cases  they  are  entitled  to
                  compensation. The cost of lay-off  compensation  in  Chile
                  was increased, benefitting only workers with  five  years'
                  service and more.


         3. Mining sector in Chile


              The Committee visited to Codelco, a state-owned copper  mining
              company. It has joint venture  mining  programmes  with  South
              Africa and other private companies. All natural  resources  in
              Chile are in the hands of the state, and mining  is  the  most
              important export commodity. The total investments which  South
              Africa has with Chile amounts to US$27 million.


              About 70 000 workers are employed in the  mining  sector.  The
              average age of workers in the mines is 38. This industry  uses
              a lot of technical-oriented skills. Chileans are of  the  view
              that, with the introduction of new technology and new ways  of
              management, there is a necessity for more skilled workers  who
              are able to adapt to these.


              However, workers in the coal mining sector  have  less  of  an
              education.  It  is  difficult  to  introduce   them   to   new
              challenges.


              Gender representation in the  mining  industry  is  still  not
              adhered to.  There  are  more  men  than  women.  One  of  the
              obstacles is access to protection grants for women  so  as  to
              enable them to be part of the sector and the economy.


              Mining sector companies invest heavily  in  training.  Workers
              are also trained in self-protection on the mines.


         4. Regional integration


              Although Chile has a small market, it is  good  base  for  the
              South  American  region.  Fruit  and  fish  are  main   export
              products. Chile has signed a free  trade  agreement  with  the
              European Union. This will offer the country a huge market  for
              certain goods. Chile is the second largest producer of  salmon
              in the world. This gives the country a  comparative  advantage
              over other countries. Currently, the  country  is  negotiating
              with the United States for a free trade agreement  because  of
              US interest in the South American region.


     F.     Conclusion


         The delegation's final  conclusion  was  that  the  trip  was  both
         informative and  beneficial.  Many  of  the  differences,  both  in
         policy and practice experienced, have provided the delegation  with
         new  and  fresh  insights.  Chile  and  South  Africa   have   many
         similarities. Both countries have similar histories and  approaches
         to their post-oppression regimes. Both have statutory  bodies  like
         the UIF and the CCMA.


         The experience of examining and engaging with the  application  and
         administration of these bodies and Chile's general approach to  its
         economic growth and development will provide  lasting  benefits  to
         the Committee in its future endeavours.
