              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Council met at 09:05.

The Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I notice that the hon Dipico is here.  I
was wondering what the commotion is about.  [Laughter.]  Hon  members,  I've
been informed that there won't be any motions from members.

We now come to the first motion as printed on the Order Paper. There  is  no
speaker's list on this motion. I shall now put the  question.  The  question
is that the motion be agreed to. The decision is  dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 65  of  the  Constitution.  I  shall  first  ascertain  whether  all
delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  the  votes  of  their
province.  I  note  that  all  delegation  heads  are  indeed  present.   In
accordance with Rule 71 I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity  to
make declarations of vote if they wish to  do  so.  Is  there  any  province
wishing to make a declaration of vote? I note there is none.

We proceed therefore, to voting on  the  question.  This  will  be  done  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads  should  indicate  whether
they vote in favour, against or abstain from voting. The Eastern Cape?

upon the hon Deputy President to address the House. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Chairperson
of the National Council of Provinces, hon Premiers, MECs, hon  members,  I'm
delighted to be able to share a few thoughts with you today.

Each September we are all urged to renew our commitment to the  values  that
we hold dear and which bind us together as enshrined  in  our  Constitution.
We also acknowledge and appreciate  our  national  symbols.  Our  flag,  the
national anthem and Coat of Arms represent our national identity and  should
continue to enrich our pride and a sense of  nationhood  and  patriotism  in
all of us. We also remember even the lesser-known national symbols, such  as
the national flower, the protea; the national  animal,  the  springbok,  the
national tree, the yellowwood;  the  national  fish,  the  galjoen  and  the
national bird, the blue crane.

 Heritage month also provides for the  explosion  of  cultural  celebrations
which express our heritage and promote our cultural diversity. We also  have
another cause to celebrate. We are only a few months  away  from  the  tenth
anniversary of the liberation of our country and people. Heritage month  and
Heritage Day provide us with an opportunity to  begin  warm-up  celebrations
throughout the country. We've come a long way since 1994. We were a  country
divided and a nation in turmoil facing a bleak future. From 27  April  1994,
we went beyond expectations as we managed to  transcend  hatred,  bitterness
and pain and began to rebuild our country in a spirit  of  togetherness  and
co-operation. It is therefore, not surprising that many call our  transition
to democracy a miracle.

As we celebrate we'll be remembering  the  determination,  commitment,  hard
work and sacrifices of thousands of our people from  Mangaung,  kaNyamazane,
KwaMashu, Guguletu, Seshego, Galeshewe,  Mafikeng,  Soweto,  Mdantsane,  the
Cape Flats, Chatsworth, and many other areas. The  sacrifices  of  countless
South Africans laid the foundation for our nonracial, nonsexist democracy.

There are a number of lessons that we learnt  from  resolving  our  conflict
which informed our approach to issues and the rebuilding of our country.  We
learnt, for example, that working together  regardless  of  our  differences
was the recipe  for  success.  That  is  why  this  Government  believes  in
constantly promoting partnerships with all sectors of  society  in  building
our country.

We also learnt that regardless of  conditions  in  any  conflict,  peace  is
always achievable. If there is total commitment and love for the people  and
country, honesty, a clear vision of the way forward and a concrete  plan  of
how to reach our destination, success is guaranteed. The experience  of  the
horrors  of   apartheid   developed   and   deepened   our   commitment   to
reconciliation. We  needed  to  eliminate  the  quest  for  retribution  and
inculcate positive and constructive values.

Reconciliation was expressed in practical terms in the inclusive  nature  of
the multiparty negotiation process, which allowed the representation of  all
political parties, irrespective of their size. This unique  element  ensured
our success. Reconciliation was further expressed in  the  manner  in  which
the interim Constitution  was  crafted,  particularly  with  regard  to  the
constitutional imperative to establish a government of national unity.

Another positive attribute for our nation is that  we  decided  to  confront
the  demons  of  the  past  openly  through  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission. The TRC was beneficial  as  a  healing  process  to  many  South
Africans who were directly affected by apartheid brutality.

Our  Constitution  remains  the  cornerstone  of  our  new  nation  and  new
democracy and defines who we are and what we want to  achieve.  In  drafting
the Constitution we were guided by key values  such  as  tolerance,  respect
for the views and positions of other  parties  on  issues,  preparedness  to
apply the principle of  give  and  take  during  the  negotiations  and  the
commitment to put our past behind us while we negotiated.  The  preamble  of
our Constitution states this very clearly, and I quote:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past;
  Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
  Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.
  We therefore, through our  freely  elected  representatives,  adopt  this
  Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic so as to-


       Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society
       based on democratic values, social  justice  and  fundamental  human
       rights;


       Lay the foundations for a  democratic  and  open  society  in  which
       government is based on the will of the people and  every  citizen  is
       equally protected by law;

Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential  of  each
person; and

Build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its  rightful  place
as a sovereign state in the family of nations.

This is the vision that should continue to guide  our  actions  to  build  a
dignified and prosperous future for future generations. In marking  Heritage
month we also need to celebrate the expansion  of  a  better  life  for  all
since the achievement of democracy in 1994.

Two successful rounds of democratic elections have  seen  the  consolidation
of democracy and its extension to the local level and  step  by  step  South
Africans are uniting to help eradicate the legacy  of  racial  division  and
inequality. Granted, we still have some way to go before  we  can  say  that
there is universal access to services, but  the  progress  made  so  far  is
indeed remarkable. The restoration of human  dignity  that  we  achieved  in
1994  has  to  be  accompanied  by  the  eradication  of  poverty  and   the
improvement in the quality of  life.  All  government  departments  executed
their tasks with this objective as one of the central points of reference.

While service delivery is important, also critical is the  manner  in  which
public servants provide services. The Batho Pele -  people  first  -campaign
is pursued to inculcate in public  servants  the  spirit  of  people-centred
quality service. It promotes our vision of a caring Government. We urge  the
public to help us monitor the service provided by  public  servants  through
reporting uncaring behaviour by public servants.  We  recently  acknowledged
health-care workers who provide excellent  care  and  support  to  patients,
particularly patients living with Aids. We  commend  such  selflessness  and
dedication and encourage it among all public servants.

Hon members, another attribute of the new  democratic  dispensation  is  the
accessibility  of  Government  services.   This   is   being   enhanced   by
establishing multipurpose community centres among other  initiatives.  There
are currently 43 multipurpose community centres in operation; with  more  to
be established.

On the economic front, macroeonomic stability has been achieved and  we  had
to ensure sustained economic growth in a  competitive  and  volatile  global
setting. Internationally, South Africa's standing, and in  particular  as  a
voice for development, peace and stability, is acknowledged. Our  quest  for
stability has extended beyond our borders;  given  this  country's  role  in
promoting development and  pursuing  peace  and  democracy  on  the  African
continent.

We believe we have achieved so much as a nation because we do not  emphasize
our differences, but put South Africa and its people first. We are a  nation
that confounds critics. We see strength in our diversity  while  others  may
see diversity as a threat or weakness. Our  different  languages,  cultures,
customs and traditions as  well  as  geographical  spread  are  all  special
ingredients in the melting pot that is South Africa.  Most  importantly,  we
are united in our quest for a better life. We may differ in methods used  in
achieving a better life for all and will probably  differ  with  regards  to
the tally of what has been achieved in the last 10 years, but that does  not
mean that we should differ with regard to the objectives.

Building a better South Africa and improving the quality of life of all  our
people should be what drives us all. We've come this far, and we still  have
a long way to go before we can say that all our goals  have  been  achieved,
but we must acknowledge that we have made a good beginning.

Our democracy has gone through a lot  of  trials  and  tribulations  in  the
first decade. It has passed all the tests, which is another  reason  for  us
to celebrate. One  of  these  tests  is  the  investigation  of  the  Deputy
President by the National Directorate of the Public Prosecutions. This  test
has indicated the extent  to  which  our  democracy  has  deepened  and  how
contrary this is to the  views  of  the  so-called  opinion-makers  who  are
saying the investigation has weakened democracy. It has actually proven  how
strong and mature our democracy has become. [Applause.]

It is only in a mature democracy where  a  deputy  president  of  a  country
would be investigated without  any  interference  or  attempt  to  stop  the
investigation by government or the deputy president himself. [Applause.]

In some established democracies, high office  is  protected  and  incumbents
are granted immunity. In our country, all are equal before the law. We  have
never questioned these principles. We respect them and abide by them.
The Deputy President has not  interfered  with  the  investigation  and  has
taken appropriate steps, within the law and  his  rights,  to  seek  redress
regarding the outcome of the investigation.

The investigation has been a test for other institutions  as  well.  It  has
tested the maturity of state organs responsible for the investigations,  and
the potential  and  capacity  for  the  abuse  of  power  and  authority  by
individuals in these institutions.

It has also been a critical test for the  media,  whose  freedom  we  fought
for, which is enshrined in section 16 of the Constitution  of  our  country.
The media is supposed to be an  independent  watchdog  which  does  not  and
should not take sides in any conflict but seek to provide  the  public  with
information to allow them to make up their own minds.

A  professional  media  is  supposed  to  remain  true  to  the  ethics   of
objectivity, fairness and balance, and be open to all sides  of  the  story.
The investigation has left many questions as to whether the  media  remained
true to these noble ethics or whether it took a firm position to  vigorously
support one party to the full to further mutual agendas.

The investigation has also been a test for political parties, the extent  to
which they are prepared to assist the democratic process  constructively  or
whether they choose to become sound-bite specialists,  swallowing  any  lead
that they are given to get media mileage.

The important outcome of this whole debacle is that  our  democracy  has  so
far not been shaken by it. It has withstood the  challenges  because  it  is
above individuals and is rooted on very strong  foundations.  This  is  what
opinion-makers should be emphasising about our democracy.

This Government should also be  congratulated  for  adhering  to  democratic
principles and not being tempted to  abuse  power,  and  this  is  what  the
opinion-makers should be saying about our democracy and Government.

We are very proud to have inherited a priceless  legacy  from  the  founding
fathers and mothers of this nation. Let  us  treasure  it  and  continue  to
build a prosperous nation on the foundation of 27 April 1994. I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

IPHINI LIKASIHLALO WOMKHANDLU KAZWELONKE WEZIFUNDAZWE (Mnu  M  J  Mahlangu):
Sihlalo, Phini likaMongameli, boNdunankulu bezifundazwe bonke abakhona  kule
Ndlu namhlanje kanye nalabo ababamele, malungu onke omKhandlu akhona  lapha,
ngithanda ukuthatha leli  thuba  ngibonge  kunina  nonke  ukuba  nami  ngibe
ngomunye ozophonsa itshe esivivaneni kule nkulumo yePhini likaMongameli.

Kungijabulisa kakhulu lokhu esengikuzwile namhlanje ukuthi into  esihlangene
ngayo, singababusi, ukwakha izwe lethu  laseNingizimu  Afrika.  (Translation
of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  Deputy
President,  all  Premiers  present  in  this   Chamber   today   and   their
representatives, and all the members of the Council who are present here,  I
would like to take this opportunity to thank you all that I am one of  those
to take part in the Deputy President's debate.

I am very pleased with what I have just heard -  that  what  brings  us  all
together as legislators is our responsibility to build  our  country,  South
Africa.]

Our country has seen a  transition  from  the  most  brutal  and  repressive
system of apartheid to a country where all  its  citizens  enjoy  democracy.
This did not come without sacrifices. The struggles of  the  people  of  our
country to bring change culminated in the search for a  peaceful  transition
to democracy. The ANC initiated a search for peace  in  our  country.  Since
1987 the organisation intensively campaigned for a  negotiated  transfer  of
power, because we believed that  a  peaceful  transition  to  democracy  was
possible and we found it. This led us through Codesa  at  Kempton  Park  and
multiparty negotiations to finding a solution that would set our country  on
the road to democracy. Through those negotiations a  new  society  began  to
emerge. We  were  able  to  deliver  our  society  which  was  polarised  by
apartheid to freedom and democracy. We now  live  in  a  country  where  its
different people live side by side, working  together  as  one  nation.  Our
efforts at promoting reconciliation have helped  us  bring  together  people
who were living on opposite sides of the fence.

Ake nibheke, namhlanje: Bhekani kuyo yonke le Ndlu. Ngicela ukuthi  nijikise
amehlo enu nibhekane nonke kule Ndlu namhlanje. Bheka ukuthi ngubani  ohleli
eceleni kwakho. Bheka ukuthi yinhloboni yomuntu leyo.  Kodwa,  namhlanje  le
Ndlu  isithathe  yasihlanganisa  sonke.  Akusekho  obiza  omunye   ngenhlobo
ethile: Kuthiwe makahambe aye kohlala KwaNdebele;  eTranskei  -  emaXhoseni;
naKwaZulu-Natali  ngoba  engumZulu.  Okwenzekile  ukuthi  sonke   singabantu
baseNingizimu Afrika. [Ihlombe.]

Nakhu okubalulekile: Sonke sakha izwe laseNingizimu  Afrika.  Yilizwe  lethu
sonke  futhi  buphelile  ubuhlanga  lobu  esasihlukaniswe   yibo   embusweni
wangaphambilini. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Just look in here today. Look all over this  Chamber.  Will  you  all  turn
your heads and look at one another  in  this  Chamber  today.  Look  who  is
sitting next to you. See which person it is. Today this Chamber has  brought
all of us together. No one refers to the other by  their  kind:  No  one  is
told to go and live in KwaNdebele,  Transkei,  emaXhoseni  or  KwaZulu-Natal
because they are Zulu. The scenario is that we are all  South  Africans  and
the most important thing is that we are  all  building  our  country,  South
Africa. [Applause.]

The country belongs to all of us and the racism that  has  always  separated
us during the past regime is no longer there.]

Our new democracy has provided us with the opportunity to right  the  wrongs
committed by the previous regime, which sought to dehumanise our  people  by
undermining their cultures, languages and traditions. It  is  gratifying  to
see that instead of crumbling as a result of the atrocities of the  previous
regime, our nation has found  unity  in  its  diversity.  Our  Constitution,
which we adopted earlier in our democracy, promotes our diverse culture  and
languages. It obliges  our  organs  of  state  to  ensure  that  they  adopt
policies which promote  the  use  of  languages,  including  the  indigenous
languages  that  were  not  recognised  by  the  apartheid  government.  The
Government has made strides in promoting the use of our official  languages.
This year Parliament has taken steps to promote  the  use  of  all  official
languages. We now have adopted a language policy which  recognises  all  our
languages to be phased in over five years.

This important development in the history of our parliament is  one  of  the
steps we  are  taking  of  making  sure  that  we  give  expression  to  the
provisions  of  our  Constitution  which  envisages  a   multicultural   and
multilingual society. One of the things that I want to propose today,  which
I think Parliament will recognise, is that we should begin what  we  call  a
language laboratory. Now I will tell you  why  I  propose  this,  because  I
think it is important that all parliamentarians must be  in  a  position  to
express themselves in more than one language.

Ek kan praat. Ek het geen probleem om Afrikaans te praat nie. [Applous.]  [I
can  speak.  I  don't  have  a  problem  expressing  myself  in   Afrikaans.
[Applause.]]

HON MEMBERS: Mooi, baie mooi! [Good, excellent!]

I can talk and express myself in English.  Ndiyathetha  mna.  [I  can  speak
isiXhosa.] Ngiyakhuluma. [I can speak isiZulu.] Ndza vulavula  Xitsonga.  Ke
a bolela e bile ke a buwa. [I can speak Sepedi, Setswana and Sesotho.]

That is very important for us as leaders,  particularly  in  an  institution
like this, to show our people out there that we are proud of our  languages,
that we are proud of our cultures. We should set that  standard,  we  should
show that so that our people out there can realise  that  we  mean  business
and we are serious.

Our institutions of democracy are truly beginning to be institutions of  the
people. In other developments the NCOP launched a programme of  meeting  the
people. This involves taking Parliament to where the people  live  in  order
to give them  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  running  of  their
government. This is very different from the attitude  and  practice  of  the
parliament in the previous regime. Our Government also has as its  programme
izimbizo, where people are afforded the  opportunity  to  directly  interact
with  their  leaders  around   issues   that   affect   them.   The   NCOP's
constitutional mandate bears evidence of a  transition  from  a  culture  of
disregard of the majority and winner takes all to that  of  the  magnanimity
of protecting the minorities.

As  an  institution  it  developed  from  a  House  whose  function  was  to
crosscheck the National Assembly, and  in  many  instances  it  was  just  a
rubber stamp of the lower house. During this phase it could  be  manipulated
for political reasons, as was the case when the attempt was made to make  it
a court of appeal when  the  then  government  wanted  to  have  a  separate
voters' roll for the coloured people of South Africa.

Nayi-ke enye into ebalulekile engifuna  ukuyikhuluma:  UmKhandlu  kaZwelonke
weziFundazwe usihlanganisa sonke futhi njengoba sihleli lapha.  Niyakhumbula
ukuthi ekuqaleni  ngithe  bukani  ukuthi  ngobani  abahleli  eceleni  kwenu.
Lapha,   emKhandlwini   kaZwelonke   weziFundazwe,   kukhona    izifundazwe.
Izithunywa zazo zihlezi nathi khona lapha.

Mayelana nokudingidwa  kwezindaba  zabantu  baseNingizimu  Afrika,  izindaba
zombuso  kazwelonke   zidingidwa   khona   lapha   emKhandlwini   kaZwelonke
weziFundazwe. Izindaba zomasipala  zidingidwa  khona  lapha  kulo  mKhandlu.
Sihlanganise bonke laba bantu nale  mibuso  sayibeka  ndawonye.  Sihlangene,
siyaxoxa,   siyalungisa   futhi   sakha   imithetho   sisonke,   sihlangene.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)
[Here is an important issue that I want to raise: The  National  Council  of
Provinces unites all of us sitting here. You will recall that earlier  on  I
asked you to look and see who the person sitting next to  you  is.  Here  in
the NCOP we have provinces. Their representatives are sitting here with  us.


When it comes to the deliberation of issues relating to the people of  South
Africa, national Government affairs are discussed here in the NCOP. We  have
united all these peoples and governments  and  put  them  together.  We  are
united, we discuss, we put things right and we make  the  laws  together  as
one.]

We therefore put all these tiers of Government  together.  I  want  all  the
people of South Africa to realise that importance of the NCOP. To me  it  is
very important and it is an achievement.

Buka-ke ubuhle obungaka! Buka, ubuhle bezwe  lethu  bubuyile.  Buka  uthando
oluqinile phakathi kwabantu bethu  -  ukuthi  sithandana  kangakanani  ngoba
sibona ukuthi singabantu baseNingizimu Afrika sonke.  Akekho  obekwa  phansi
kuthiwe mncane kunomunye.  Sonke  singabantu,  siyalingana.  Buka  isithunzi
esinaso. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Just look at all this beauty! Look, the beauty  of  our  country  is  back.
Look at the strong love that our people share,  at  how  much  we  love  one
another seeing that we are all South Africans. Look at  the  human  dignity.
No one is undermined and seen as inferior to the other.  We  are  all  human
beings and are equal. Look at the dignity that we have.]

Look at the dignity that  we  have  as  South  Africans  since  we  achieved
democracy. We have restored the dignity of our people in South Africa and  I
think that is what is important. I am concluding, Chair. I can see  you  are
looking at me now to say your time is over. [Laughter.]

As a nation we should be proud of  our  heritage  and  regard  our  culture,
religion, language and tradition  as  our  important  assets.  Our  national
heritage sites, some of which are recognised internationally, make us  proud
of our nation's identity. These include sites such as Robben  Island,  which
stands as a symbol of human endurance, and the cradle of  humankind  in  the
North West, which bears evidence of existence of mankind  for  a  period  of
one to four million years.

In conclusion, as we are on the verge of celebrating Heritage  Day,  one  of
the important days on which we celebrate our nation's  identity,  we  should
regard the rich legacy of our nations as  a  foundation  on  which  we  must
build the future of this country. Our celebration must  help  strengthen  us
as a nation. They should help us reinvigorate our strength that has seen  us
through the decades of oppression and repression. We need the  strength,  we
need the communication to face the challenges such as poverty. I thank  you,
Chair. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am sure hon members are aware that  it
is very difficult to stop a presiding officer. [Laughter.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): Chairperson of  the  NCOP,
hon Deputy President Jacob Zuma, Premiers, members of the NCOP,  ladies  and
gentlemen, comrades and friends, I quote -


  Our heritage celebrates our achievements and  contributes  to  redressing
  past inequities. It educates, it deepens our understanding of society and
  encourages us to empathise with the experience of others. It  facilitates
  healing and material and symbolic restitution, and it  promotes  new  and
  previously neglected research into our rich oral traditions and customs.

This quotation from the National Heritage  Act  encapsulates  correctly  the
essence of what we are about as South Africans.

As we approach the celebration of Heritage Day  on  24  September  2003,  we
should do this with a sense of pride for the efforts  we  have  achieved  to
date and an appreciation of the challenges that still lie ahead  of  us.  We
are hopeful and positive about the future, for it holds great potential  for
our children and grandchildren.

The Northern Cape province will be hosting this year's World  Tourism  Month
in the magnificent Green Kalahari region of  Upington.  All  roads  lead  to
Upington this year. Upington and the region are endowed with a rich  history
and culture matched by the natural beauty that surround them.  Not  only  do
the two large rivers of South Africa converge in  the  area,  this  resource
also creates fertile grounds for large tracts of grape and  related  farming
along the river, until it flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

The people of Upington also played  a  crucial  role  in  the  struggle  for
freedom in South Africa. We cannot forget the role played by people such  as
the late Anton Lubowski in the Upington 26 trial, where 14  of  the  accused
were sentenced to death.

Three months ago we celebrated for the first time when Ma De Bruin  received
her house. This woman was one of the 14 accused.  She  is  a  mother  and  a
grandmother who has waited since 1994 until now. She has been  staying  with
grandchildren. We honoured her by giving her an RDP house only three  months
ago. She has never been angry. She has never said that she  is  entitled  to
any other thing. I think we should  all  learn  from  such  dedicated  South
Africans.

During the Tourism Month celebrations we will also  bring  out  the  natural
beauty that is in the Green Kalahari. Here, delegates  and  guests  will  be
treated to the unsurpassed natural beauty in an area full  of  surprises  in
the region that is the largest exporter  of  grapes.  We  speak  about  this
event because of the diverse cultures  and  exciting  tourism  possibilities
that  behold  there,  in  the  context  of  heritage  contributing   towards
addressing  the  inequalities  of  the  past  and  contributing  towards   a
development of our heritage and people.

Our heritage must contribute towards  development  and  nation-building.  It
must teach our  children  and  grandchildren  about  the  geography  of  our
country, its people and their different cultures.  It  must  also  create  a
sense of nationhood. Nationhood is about  patriotism.  Patriotism  is  about
taking part in the life of the country and its development.

Therefore, we must ensure that our youth  is  adequately  prepared  to  take
part in these occasions of nationhood. Creating a  sense  of  nationhood  is
also about empowering our society to take decisions  about  their  lives  to
ensure that those young people of the appropriate  age  are  also  empowered
through the acquisition of proper South African documentation to  take  part
in elections and therefore also engender a sense of nationhood  through  the
South African identity.

Hon Deputy President, the Northern  Cape  is  well  known  for  its  diverse
cultures. We are proud that in that part of the land  we  have  the  largest
group of the Nama-speaking people, we have  the  San,  the  Korana  and  the
Griqua communities, who have been forgotten by  history.  These  people,  in
the past, were afraid to speak their languages, to sing their songs  and  to
practise their traditions and customs.

They have been apologetic when they faced other people in South Africa,  but
today we are proud to say that this new Constitution  has  allowed  them  to
start speaking their language and the Northern Cape has recruited  a  number
of teachers from Namibia to teach the language, and we also  encourage  them
to create written literature for these people.

They are proud now because they  practise  their  cultures  and  traditions.
They have been encouraged to stand up bold and move in South Africa as  true
South Africans. This really makes us proud as South Africans, because  these
people, the San people, who lost their land, today have had large tracts  of
land returned to them. They own half of the national park in  the  Kalahari.
That is good.

We are left with only one thing: to win the Olympics. We are busy  preparing
these San people to run  appropriately,  because  we  think  they  have  the
potential to outrun the people of the world. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

If you put a springbok in front of these youngsters and girls,  there  would
be nobody to stop them. [Laughter.] We will have to have  a  way  to  ensure
that we nurture this  talent.  We  will  start  by  having  a  symbol  of  a
springbok running, and they will run forever and  ever.  You  have  seen  in
history that they run after a springbok until it falls dead to  the  ground.
They do not shoot it, they run after it. This is what we  want  to  see.  We
want them to practise that. We want to  ensure  that  they  can  go  to  the
Olympics, and we would then outrun all other people in this world.

I enjoy, every time when I am at an occasion with the Nama and  San  people,
dancing the Nama "stap" with them. It is a totally different dance. It  even
surpasses the Madiba jive. [Laughter.] It is  a  different  jive.  The  only
person who can outdo them is the Deputy President ...  [Laughter]  ...  when
he dances the Zulu dance, it really also brings pride in all of us,  because
he is a true son of this soil.

Let us not rest on our  laurels.  We  must  continue  to  promote  unity  in
diversity and ensure that our nation grows as we want to  see  it  grow.  We
thank the Deputy President for his exemplary  leadership,  even  during  the
period where he is under tremendous attack.  He  has  shown  that  he  is  a
leader respecting our Constitution.

I want  to  bring  a  message  from  the  people  of  the  province:  Deputy
President, the people of the Northern Cape support you. They are behind  you
and they say that you are doing a splendid job. Continue and be  focused  on
doing what South Africans say we must do. This is what we want to  see  from
you and your leadership, and the type of stature you are promoting  in  that
position is what all of us want to see.

On that note, we look forward to seeing all of you joining  us  in  Upington
as we promote the diversity of our cultures. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF  THE  EASTERN  CAPE  (Rev  M  A  Stofile):  Mhlalingaphambili
ohloniphekileyo, malungu ale Ndlu  inkulu  kangaka,  Sekela-Mongameli  wethu
esimhloniphayo   nesimthandayo,   okokuqala,   mandingxengxeze    ngokungena
sekuhlelwe phantsi apha eNdlwini.  Abandaziyo  bayazi  ukuba  asilosiko  lam
elo, unokuba ukho unobangela. Ndiyangxengxeza, Mhlalingaphambili.

Okwesibini,  ndiyakwazi  nam,  njengomhlekazi  uM  J   Mahlangu,   ukulusoma
nokulugoba ulwimi, kodwa namhlanje ndifunge ndisesekhaya ukuba  inene  ndiza
kuthetha esi seenkobe sona isiXhosa.

Namhlanje, ngenxa  yenkululeko  esiyizuzele  izwe  lethu,  maninzi  amachule
noochwepheshe  afana  neengcungcu  ukucikoza  ngendlela  ilizwe   eliphethwe
ngayo.  Kodwa  olona  dondolo  lokwazi  ukuba  uluntu  jikelele  olungenanto
luyijongileyo  ngaphandle  kokuthetha  inyaniso  lucinga   ntoni   na   lona
ngendlela  oluphethwe  ngayo  eMzantsi  Afrika,  ngabantu   kwiindawo   zabo
zokonwaba. Nokuba kusemva  konmgcwabo,  nokuba  isizathu  kukubuyisa  ixhego
lekhaya, nokuba kusemtshatweni wentombazana okanye wonyana,  nokuba  kuphaya
emashibhini, nokuba  kukwiindawo  zokuzonwabisa  kwezemidlalo,  kwezi  ndawo
kulapho  abantu  bakuthi  bazivakalisa   khona   iindlela   abacinga   ukuba
baphetheke ngazo.

Phaya eBhayi kukho  isikhululo  sakwa-SABC,  uMhlobo  Wenene  fm.  Ukususela
ngentsimbi  yokuqala  ekuseni  ukuya   kutsho   kweyecala   emva   kweyesine
kwasekuseni njalo esi sikhululo sinenkqubo ebizwa ngokuba ngu-12 down,  kuba
yaqala ngentsimbi ye-12 ngo-1995. Yeka nje ukuba seyiqala  ngeyokuqala  apha
ku-2003. Kule nkqubo kulapho abantu  baseMzantsi  Afrika,  oonogada  beefemu
zeli lizwe, oomama abaphangela emakhitshini, amajoyini  aseGoli  naseNtshona
Koloni- bonke abantu ngokweminyaka yabo nangokwamazinga abo okuya  nokungayi
esikolweni - bavakalisa khona izimvo zabo ngendlela ilizwe lethu  eliphethwe
ngayo. Bonke, Mhlalingaphambili, ukuza kutsho  ekuseni,  bavakalisa  indlela
abangazange bayazi ngayo ukuba kanti kumnandi kangaka  ukuba  ngabemi  bezwe
laseMzantsi Afrika.

NgoMgqibelo  kule  veki  iphelileyo,  phaya  eMonti,  u-moderator  wamaRhabe
aseMazantsi eAfrika, ukusuka eZimbabwe, eZambia, ukuhla  ukuza  kutsho  apha
eKapa, ebebalisa ngendlela bona njengeenkokeli zeenkolo abachulumanca  ngayo
mihla le xa bebuya phaya eofisini kaMongameli,  ngenxa  yendlela  abaphathwa
ngayo  ngulo  Rhulumente;  ngendlela  abaxatyiswe  ngayo  ngulo  Rhulumente.
Akukho  kugxinywa  nakubanjwa  ngesixhanti.  Wonke  ubani  unikwa   ilungelo
alifaneleyo. Kaloku amalungelo  alungele  abanini  bawo,  khon'  ukuze  elam
linqande  elakho  linganyatheli  elam,   nelam   linqandwe   lelakho   ukuze
lingalinyatheli elakho.

Bonke  abalawuli  beenkolo  beli  lizwe   -   yinyani   emsulwa   ke   leyo,
Mhlalingaphambili, kuba sidibana nabo phantse veki le -  bavakalisa  indlela
uMzantsi  Afrika  obanika  inkuthazo   ngayo   kwilizwe   liphela   neAfrika
ngokubanzi.  Umzekelo  wabo  oqaqambileyo  nguBhishopu   Dandala,   abambona
njengenkomo yedini yeli lizwe eye kukhokela iAfrika iphela kwezenkolo.

Mhlalingaphambili, besiseBhisdolophu, eBurgersdorp, kule nyanga  iphelileyo,
kweziya ntaba  zoKhahlamba  -  iingingqi.  Sasikhe  saya  phaya  kulo  nyaka
ungaphaya kwalo uphelileyo kwaye safika  ubuhlanga  bugquba  bukhupha  ihagu
edladleni, kodwa kule nyanga iphelileyo sifike  ubumbano  lusothusa.  Izinto
ezingathi  zezona  zibahlanganisayo  abemi  baleya  ndawo  yinkaba  yentetho
isiBhulu, kuba imbali iyabonisa ukuba  ulwimi  isiBhulu,  apho  inkaba  yalo
yombelwe khona kuphaya eBhisdolophu. Abantu  bokuqala  ukuluthetha  ngabantu
baphaya eBhisdolophu. Ngoku  ke  baququzelela  ukubhiyozela  ukuzalwa  kwale
ntetho, bonke kulaa ndawo yabo, abantsundu nabamhlophe.

Okulandelayo, bebambisene  neDyunivesithi  yasePotchefstroom,  baququzelela,
bonke  ngokulinganayo,   ukothulela   umnqwazi   ukufakwa   kwembewu   yalaa
Dyunivesithi eBhisdolophu,  apho  izelwe  khona  iPotchefstroom,  Nkulumbuso
uMolefe.  Abantu  balaa  ndawo  bayiqhwabela  izandla  into  yokuba   bazala
umntwana okhule wade wangakanana.

Imida yamaphondo yaphuliwe phaya. Kule veki iphelileyo iphondo lethu  iMpuma
Koloni, abamelwane iFreyistata  nabanye  abamelwane  aba  baseMntla  Koloni,
bebenesibhadlalala sentlanganiso kweliya  dama  iXhariep,  bejonga  iindlela
zokwandisa eziya projekthi  ziphaya  zokwandisa  ukhenketho  kulaa  mqwebedu
wendawo. Luphelile uchuku,  Mhlalingaphambili.  Iphelile  laa  nto  yokuthi,
"hayi, kukwam apha; "hayi, kukwakho phaya, lo  mda  akufuneki  uwele  kuwo".
Yonke loo nto ibonisa indlela idemokhrasi yethu evuthwa ngayo.

Kulaa lali yaseTshabho kukho umfo wakwaSifingo ongazange  aye  esikolweni  -
umkhuluwa kaBaninzi, Mphathiswa  wephondo  -  othi  xa  ethetha,  "Ndiyayiva
yonke le nto ithethwa emaphepheni. Into endiyaziyo  mna  kukuba  kuthi  rhhh
endlwini yam  ngenxa  kamabonakude,  umbane  ndiwucumza  eludongeni,  amanzi
ndiwafumana ecocekile etepini elapha eyadini. Ezinye izinto zezokonwaba".

UMnumzana  uSifingo  uvakalisa  izimvo  zabantu  abaninzi.   Nokuba   ubheke
emaMpondweni okanye ebaThenjini, nokuba ubheke kwiilokishi zethu,  uMnumzana
Sifingo uvakalisa into enye, yokuba isidima sethu siyabuya ngoku.

Abamelwane  bethu  eXixaxamas  bathi  mhla  kwangcwatywa   umakhulu   uSarah
Baartman, kwembiwa i-mummy  yaphaya  eHumansdorp,  okokuqala  ebomini  babo,
babona urhulumente ozikhathaleleyo izithethe nezinto zabo. Nabo  bengamaKhoi
namaSan, amaqhakancu ngabula  thina,  baziva  bengabantu  phakathi  kwezinye
iintlanga.

Mhlalingaphambili, kunokuba ligqutha lebhenqa lodwa kule  Ndlu  elingakhange
liyibone inamba isombuluka xa  intlanganisela  yenkcubeko  yaseMpuma  Koloni
yazo zonke iintlanga yayityityimba, icondoba, ingqisha,  ifudusa.  Ababeyile
phaya   eRhini   kuMnyhadala   weSizwe   nababeyile   kwiNkomfa   yeHlabathi
engoPhuhliso oluZinzileyo eyayiseSandton bayayingqina loo nto.

UKomani ugqiba i-150 eminyaka kulo nyaka. Bonke abemi balaa ndawo,  aBelungu
nabaThembu, bayavana ngokuba eli gama  lithi  "Queenstown"  liyilungele  laa
ndawo, nangona bengavani ncam,  kuba  bambi  bathi  libhekisa  kuKumkanikazi
uVitoliya  bambi  bathi  libhekisa  kuKumkanikazi  uNonesi.  Kona   bayavana
ngokuba uKomani yindawo yabo neyeekumkanikazi zabo.

EVenterstad umakhulu uMagrieta  ukhokele  iqela  laseMpuma  Koloni  eligqiba
ikhulu leminyaka lizelwe.  Yena  wazalwa  ngomhla  we-11  kuOktobha,  abanye
balandela  yena.  Ukhale  iinyembezi  akubona  izipho  zikaRhulumente,  kuze
kuthiwa, "Min' emnandi  kuwe,  makhulu".  [Laphela  ixesha.]  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[The PREMIER OF THE EASTERN CAPE (Rev M A  Stofile):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon
Members of this House, hon Deputy President whom we  respect  and  love,  in
the first instance, I would like to apologise  for  coming  into  the  House
when Members are already seated.  I  am  honestly  asking  to  be  pardoned,
Chairperson.

On a second note, I would like people to  note  that  I  can  also  speak  a
second language, English, just  like  Mr  M  J  Mahlangu,  for  I  am  quite
competent in it, but I have decided to speak my  mother  tongue  today,  and
that is isiXhosa.

Now that we have freedom in our country, there are a lot of experts  talking
about how the country should be governed. However, the only way we can  find
out what people, who are committed to speaking the truth,  think  about  how
they are being governed  in  South  Africa,  is  to  listen  to  the  people
themselves when they are enjoying themselves. It  may  be  after  a  funeral
service, a customary celebration performed on behalf of a deceased  head  of
the family, a wedding ceremony, in shebeens or at  sports  grounds,  all  of
these places are where people express  their  views  about  how  they  think
their country is being governed.

In Port Elizabeth, there is a radio station called Umhlobo Wenene  FM.  From
one o'clock every morning, this radio station runs  a  programme  called  12
down as it started at 12 midnight, and in 1995. Since the beginning of  this
year, 2003, it has been starting  at  one  o'clock.  During  this  programme
people of  South  Africa,  security  guards  of  different  firms,  domestic
workers, migrant workers in Gauteng and the Western Cape and all the  people
of every age and standard of education, express their views  about  how  our
country is governed. Al of them, Chairperson, up until  this  morning,  were
relating how good it feels to be a citizen of South Africa.

On Saturday  last  week,  in  East  London,  the  Moderator  of  the  United
Congregational Church of Southern Africa,  starting  from  Zimbabwe,  Zambia
down to Cape Town, was telling us about how happy they as religious  leaders
are when they visit the  offices  of  the  hon  President,  because  of  the
treatment they receive from this Government, and good they feel to know  how
much this Government values them. They are not manhandled  or  chased  away.
Everyone is given an equal opportunity. We must always  bear  in  mind  that
one has his or her rights and they should not fight with one another.

All religious leaders in this country  -  and  that  is  true,  Chairperson,
because we meet almost every week - tell  us  about  how  encouraging  South
Africa is to South Africans and the  rest  of  the  African  people  on  the
continent of Africa. One example they cite is that of  Bishop  Dandala,  who
has been sent out to lead the whole of Africa religiously, who they  see  as
an icon of this country.

Chairperson, last month we were in Burgersdorp. We last visited  that  place
the year before last and we witnessed a lot  of  racism,  but  when  we  got
there last month, we were surprised by the unity that  prevailed  there.  We
also observed that language is playing a big role in unifying people  there,
and that language is Afrikaans. The first people to speak Afrikaans  in  the
country are the people in Burgersdorp. As we speak, both  black  and  white,
they are busy with preparations to celebrate the  birth  of  this  language.
Working in conjunction with the University of Potchefstroom, they  are  busy
preparing to celebrate  the  launch  of  a  branch  of  that  university  in
Burgersdorp, where Premier Popo Molefe was born. People  of  that  area  are
very proud to have given birth to him, a son that has also made them proud.

There are no provincial boundaries that exist there. Last week  the  Eastern
Cape, their neighbours the Free Sate and the  Northern  Cape,  held  a  mass
meeting at the Gariep Dam, and they were looking at ways in  which  projects
that have been started there could increase tourism in  such  a  dry  place.
There is no more fighting, Chairperson. People are no longer making  certain
claims, saying: "This area belongs to me. That one belongs to you.  This  is
the boundary and you should stay on the  other  side".  That  clearly  shows
that people are learning to live in this democracy.

In Tshabho village, there is a certain Mr Sifingo  who  has  never  been  to
school and is the elder brother of Baninzi, an MEC, who says:  "I  hear  all
that is said in the newspapers. What I know is that there is electricity  at
my home and I use tap water that is in my own yard.  All  the  other  things
are just luxuries".

Mr Sifingo is reiterating the views of  many  people.  You  can  go  to  the
Mpondos of the Thembus, and even  to  our  townships,  and  you  would  find
people like Mr Sifingo saying the same thing, and that is that  our  dignity
is coming to us.

When Grandmother Sara Baartman's remains were reburied  in  Humansdorp,  for
the first time our neighbours at  Xixaxamas  could  see  a  Government  that
really cares about people's culture and customs.  Today  the  Khoi  and  San
people - the Hottentots as we would normally refer to them - feel that  they
are one of us.

Chairperson, somebody somewhere here missed a very nice  cultural  event  of
all races that was held in  the  Eastern  Cape  some  time  ago.  Those  who
attended the National Celebrations in Grahamstown and the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development in Sandton know what I am talking about.

Queenstown is 150 years old today. Both white people and the Thembus are  in
agreement that the name Queenstown is suitable for  that  place.  What  they
may not agree with is the origin of the word, as some claim that  it  refers
to Queen Victoria, while some say it refers to Queen Nonesi. They,  however,
all claim Queenstown to belong to all of them and the queens.

Grandmother  Magrieta,  who  lives  in  Venterstad,  leads  a  group   whose
individuals members are all 100 years old and  they  are  from  the  Eastern
Cape. She was born on 11 October and the others after  her.  She  could  not
hold back her tears when she saw the presents that  Government  had  brought
her in celebration of her birthday. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Go tla twe ke na le lefufa ka gore Tonakgolo  o
bua Sethosa se se boteng, mme fela nako e fedile. [It will be  said  that  I
am jealous of the Premier because he speaks in deep isiXhosa, but  the  time
has expired.]

Mr  P  MEYER:  Madam  Chairperson,  Deputy  President  Zuma,  premiers  here
present, I represent the Premier of  the  Western  Cape,  Mr  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk, who unfortunately cannot be present here today.

As we approach the last year of the first decade of our democracy  in  South
Africa, it is clear that the intentions of democracy  continue  to  grow  in
strength and that the public awareness of these  institutions  continues  to
rise. For example: the free press  continues  both  to  challenge  perceived
Government problems  and  to  highlight  Government  successes;  the  courts
continue to assert their independence; the Chapter 9 institutions, like  the
Public Protector, the  Auditor  General  and  the  Human  Rights  Commission
continue to play the watch-dog role  for  which  they  were  created;  civil
society continues to make  its  voice  and  its  perspectives  most  vocally
heard; Parliament continues  to  provide  the  public  forum  in  which  our
Executive is held accountable. But it is the  newly  developed  institutions
of democracy in which many South African communities are finding their  most
direct access to the new freedoms of the new South Africa, like  the  imbizo
process which  is  occurring  in  every  province  and  at  every  level  of
government.

I would like to use the opportunity to share with this House a  few  of  the
experiences of the Western Cape during our recent  Provincial  Imbizo  Focus
Week and the even more recent Presidential Imbizo to our province.

The  Provincial  Imbizo  Focus  Week  entailed  a  journey  of  about  2 000
kilometres and more than  18  separate  events  in  all  five  Western  Cape
district municipalities in addition to the Cape Town Metropolitan Area.

The results of the week were overwhelming,  with  more  than  10 000  people
meeting the Cabinet and submitting 1 344 written questions or  requests  for
help, in addition to the hundreds of oral questions, to all three levels  of
government. What was of particular interest and  which  showed  how  wide  a
reach imbizos have, was that no less than 80 rural towns and 58  suburbs  of
the Western Cape were represented in the questions for written reply.

Nine-hundred-and-twenty-one   questions   were   directed   at    provincial
government, 222 to local government and 99 to national government,  but  the
overwhelming trend was for our people to make  no  distinction  -  for  most
South Africans, Government is the Government. Nothing matters to them;  they
want to see the Government in action.

We have listened to what people have said  and  we  saw  poverty,  but  also
hope. We saw richness of spirit, a burning desire for more delivery, and  we
were inspired by the faith and goodwill of our people.  This  was  democracy
in action, and one of the  most  important  experiences  of  real  community
issues, concerns and problems available to Government.

The recent visit to  the  Western  Cape  by  President  Thabo  Mbeki  was  a
powerful confirmation of many of the same experiences and messages as  those
of the Provincial Imbizo Focus Week.

The President and the  Cabinet  of  the  Western  Cape  participated  in  16
different events over the three-day period. The two major community  imbizos
in Khayelitsha and Worcester  in  the  Boland  represented  the  most  well-
attended stakeholder meetings of any provincial imbizo as yet.

The New NP and the ANC coalition government is committed  to  a  world-class
province who cares for its people.

There is  a  high  level  of  expectation  that  has  been  created  by  the
announcement by the national Government  about  the  ARV  roll-out  strategy
which will be put forward by the end of this month. We in the  Western  Cape
are willing to play an important role in  assisting  in  any  way  possible,
based on our extensive PMTCT programme, etc. The nation as a  whole  is  now
waiting for action and we hope that the Deputy President,  as  head  of  the
National Aids Council, will lead us in a  way  that  will  make  a  decisive
difference.

Coming to the subject before the House, one of the most significant  changes
in the way which South Africa approaches our history  is  reflected  in  the
change from speaking about  national  monuments  to  instead  talking  about
heritage sites. Instead of looking at  our  past  as  a  collection  of  dry
facts, dusty pictures and old buildings, removed from our experience, it  is
critical for us to embrace our past with a real  understanding  of  how  and
why we live the way we  do  today.  In  this  way  our  past,  our  complete
heritage is very much a living part of the new South Africa.

In the Western Cape our celebrations of National Heritage  Day  is  as  much
about our future as it is about our past.

For our provincial  government  the  celebrations  this  year  have  a  dual
purpose; to highlight the importance of conserving our unique  heritage  and
at the same time to bring more of our people into direct  contact  with  it,
and to effectively rediscover the value of our  shared  history.  With  more
than 2 000 of the 4 000 declared  South  African  heritage  sites,  a  large
proportion of the more than 15 000 identified rock-art  sites  and  some  of
the earliest fossils and footprints dating back some 117 000  years  in  our
province, the people of the Western Cape have much heritage to celebrate.

From historic mission settlements to fisherman's cottages,  from  industrial
buildings to historical bridges and mountains, the different strands of  our
physical history are clear.

The challenge, though, in making heritage relevant is  to  ensure  that  the
histories of all our communities are recognised, preserved and presented  to
our people. For too long there has been  a  divided  perception  about  "our
history" and "their history". The  Western  Cape  today  celebrates  all  of
these strands as equally important in  contributing  to  our  South  African
identity. We celebrate our indigenous heritage. The hon the Premier  of  the
Northern Cape has referred to it. I am not quite sure  whether  the  Premier
of the Northern Cape knows that I am a Griqua. If he does  not  know,  I  am
informing him now. We celebrate the ancient wisdom of our first  people.  We
celebrate our Eastern influence; the diverse  tapestry  which  added  to  so
much depth and  colour  to  our  culture.  And  we  celebrate  our  European
heritage; much highlighted but often oversimplified.

Last year alone more than 1 million people visited our  28  museums  in  the
Western Cape, and many of these visitors were  learners  from  our  schools.
The key to the success of our museums and other heritage  sites  has  always
been the strong partnership between Government, the  museum  board,  private
owners and donors of items and collections; relationships which have  helped
us to develop ... Is my time up? Thank you. [Applause.]

[The PREMIER OF NORTH WEST (Mr P S  Molefe):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy
Minister, Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, chairpersons and Premiers  of  the
different provinces, including you the members of this House, I  would  like
to take this opportunity to thank the Deputy  President  for  his  wonderful
speech.

The Deputy President showed us where we come from - I am talking  about  the
oppression and suffering we come from - and we have started to build  a  new
South Africa. He also showed us, as we move away from this  suffering,  that
it is proper to bring peace and show love, the main aim being  to  bring  in
the spirit of reconciliation. He also showed us that all the wrongs  brought
about by apartheid have helped us as South African citizens  to  have  love,
with the main aim of building a new nation.

We are grateful for the humility that the Deputy President  showed  when  he
allowed an investigation into the things that he spoke about. The manner  in
which the Deputy President spoke showed us that in 1994 South Africa  really
started to enter a new era of eternal democracy. He showed us that  this  is
the democratic era, led by a new  leadership;  people  who  are  humble  and
loving; and people who do not praise themselves, and work for a nation  that
they lead.

This humility is revealed when one who has certain powers, who can call  the
police and the army at any time, or do anything that he wants, does  not  do
that and says no, and says that he is a South African  like  any  other  and
upholds the Constitution of South Africa. Such things were  not  present  in
the previous governments. That is our humility. [Applause.]

Hon members, just as the Deputy President has shown, we are testimony  to  a
democratic Government and the Constitution of South Africa are above  us  as
ordinary people. As such, as  we  debate  our  President's  speech  and  are
preparing ourselves to celebrate Heritage Day, when we  will  be  respecting
our  cultures,  we  would  like  to  praise  the  central  Government,   the
provincial governments, including all the  political  parties,  for  working
together in building the unity and to support our languages and the  culture
of the different people.

From 1994, we started to build a new nation, and to build  a  foundation  of
protecting our culture and tradition. Today it is evident  that  the  people
about whose existence we did not know in South Africa are able to  stand  up
and say: "Do you know that I am really a Griqua?" Another one stands up  and
says: "I am a Tsonga and I speak Xitsonga," or "I am a  Venda  and  I  speak
Tshivenda." I grew up with them in Soweto not knowing that they  were  there
because we spoke isiZulu and Sesotho. The  respect  that  we  give  back  to
people brought them the pride to speak freely about these  things.  This  is
our freedom.]

We have made a break with our ugly past, to begin a new era of democracy.

Rona re le mebuso ya  diporofense,  re  ikaeletse  jalo  go  tlisa  mowa  wa

Ke ka moo re bonang go na le badiri ba dipolase bao ba nnang mo  matikiring,

basweung le mo bantshong, ``A re direng kagiso.'' Ke ka moo o  fitlhelang  e

``A re bueng ka bokamoso ba naga ya rona, mme re itsise batho ba  rona  gore
go diragalang mo nageng ya rona.''

Seo se supa gore re na le batho le puso e e gakgamaditseng lefatshe.  Re  mo
pakeng e e gakgamatsang, ya go aga Aforika Borwa e ntsha. [Nako  e  fedile.]
[Legofi.] (Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[All these are the backbone of democracy and of a government of  the  people
that we are building. It is the backbone of a nation living in peace,  which
is what we are building in South Africa. It is an example  that  shows  that
we can unite and go forward by working together. We have achieved  all  this
in a short time. This shows that we have put the past behind us.

We  as  provincial  governments,  are  aiming   to   bring   a   spirit   of
reconciliation to the South Africans at all times.  We  will  encourage  the
youth to do that wholeheartedly, and that they should not be discouraged  in
the campaign of uniting South Africa that shows respects to all  people.  We
want to use our different traditions as a tool that can build  a  new  South
Africa, because we want to see our future as South Africans.  As  such,  let
us work together, respect our traditions, heritage and culture  to  build  a
new South Africa.

We have already shown that  we  can  manage  these  things,  as  the  Deputy
President has said. Former honourable president Nelson Mandela was  deprived
of 27 years of his life, made to sleep in a  cold  dessert  for  many,  many
years, and when he was released it was he who extended his hand to say  that
we should make peace. He went down on his knees to say that we  should  stop
killing each other. This is a sign that we have a  new  leadership  that  is
different. We  have  started  a  new  era  of  democracy  in  South  Africa.
[Applause.]

That is why we see farmworkers, who stay in shacks and are poor,  walk  with
Mr Mandela and this Government and say to the whites  and  blacks:  "Let  us
make peace." That is why you find that people who lived in  exile  for  many
years removed from their country, when they got the  chance  to  lead  their
country, they did not use their  powers  by  taking  revenge  on  those  who
oppressed them, but said: "Let us work together."

That is why they are called names in the media, but they  continue  to  say:
"Let us talk about the future of our country and make other people aware  of
what is happening in our country."

This shows we have people and a Government that shocked the  world.  We  are
in a crucial era, the one in which  to  build  a  new  South  Africa.  [Time

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA  (Mr  N  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  our  beloved
Deputy President of this country, Mr Zuma, hon  premiers  and  hon  members,
September is a beautiful month. It is a month that signifies  rebirth  after
a long and miserable period of autumn and winter. All around  us  we  see  a
kaleidoscope of colour as trees sprout out,  flower  and  bloom.  As  nature
creates something new, something beautiful,  so  do  we  as  people  of  the
province and country continue our task of building a new nation.

We have  come  a  long  way  since  we  finally  liquidated  the  system  of
colonialism and white minority domination. For the past nine years, we  have
been hard at work as a nation, putting a shoulder to the wheel  in  building
a country that is truly democratic, nonracial, nonsexist and  prosperous.  A
lot of mistrust that was  there  in  the  initial  stages  of  this  arduous
process is gradually giving way to  a  spirit  of  togetherness  and  common
destiny. This has happened and continues  to  unfold  despite  the  doomsday
predictions of the prophets of doom. We are not there yet, but there  is  no
turning back.

Indeed, today we can proclaim that the people are indeed governing.  We  are
mindful that the journey to where we are today has not been easy but all  of
us persevered because we knew that what we had set out on was a right  road.
We need, as a nation, to take stock of what we have  accomplished  and  what
still needs to be done in the strengthening of our democracy as we  continue
to build a new nation.
The challenge of nation-building  is  central  to  achieving  our  strategic
objective of a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic society.  Nation-building
is the construction of the reality and  sense  of  common  nationhood  which
should result from the abolition of  disparities  in  the  quality  of  life
among South Africans. Those are disparities  based  on  racial,  gender  and
geographic inequalities that we inherited from the past. The starting  point
is the reconstruction and development of  our  provinces  and  our  country,
which will create the material base for nation-building.

As long as our people are divided by the wide social and economic  gap  that
is reflected in racial, geographical and gender terms, nation-building  will
be difficult to achieve. Therefore, our efforts at creating  a  better  life
for all and addressing the legacy of our immediate  past  are  fundamentally
about creating a nonracial and nonsexist South Africa whose wealth  will  be
enjoyed by the entire population.

Let us remember that the fundamental condition for liberation  is  democracy
and an  abiding  culture  of  human  rights.  That  is  why,  early  in  our
democracy,  we  came  to  the  realisation  that  all  citizens  should   be
guaranteed the rights to elect a government  of  their  choice,  freedom  of
expression, freedom from discrimination and other rights entrenched  in  our
beloved Constitution. We ensured that our people have a government  that  is
not  only  formally  based  on  their  will,  but  one  that  is  open   and
transparent; and, one that consults and continually involves the  people  in
policy formulation and implementation.

Our efforts in pursuing this difficult task must continue to  bring  an  end
to the poverty of our people. We must continue to ensure that the  divisions
of the past become just that, a thing of the past.  As  we  reconstruct  our
provinces and reclaim the whole country for all, we must continue  to  break
down all the divisions and attitudes of  the  past.  We  must  do  so  while
freeing everyone from the last vestiges of oppression, hunger,  disease  and
want.
It is our task to make the most of our freedom and to  entrench  it  in  our
new epoch as a fundamental and permanent feature of our very existence.  The
challenges facing all of us are to  contribute  to  the  building  of  truly
nonracial, peaceful, democratic and nonsexist provinces and country.  It  is
our  duty,  as  people  who  understand  the  historic  need,   to   promote
nonracialism to take the lead in the promotion of our national symbols  such
as our national flag, our anthem and our coat of arms.

Earlier, I reminded all of us that September is a beautiful month. It  is  a
month that reminds us of our diversity and our heritage. Our  diversity  and
our heritage charge us to  harness  them  in  the  interest  of  building  a
unified South African identity. The heritage month  calls  for  celebration.
We need to celebrate the fact that in our diversity  we  have  commonness  -
that of being truly South African regardless of colour, creed or religion.

As we celebrate the heritage month and take pride in our  national  symbols,
we need to remember that all  of  us  need  to  contribute  a  complete  and
rounded picture of this celebration. Certainly  that  complete  and  rounded
preservative cannot be contained only in political  speeches,  song,  dance,
poetry and in the construction of monuments. The challenge to all of  us  is
to ensure that we celebrate in all our languages. We must develop a  way  in
which our languages can, through the process,  further  grow  and  flourish.
Our experience must be recorded in many different ways and  voices  so  that
none of us feel left  out.  All  of  us  must  contribute  to  the  national
convention without anyone of  us  feeling  that  we  are  not  part  of  the
collective experience.

Indeed, our success as a  nation  depends,  in  no  small  measure,  on  the
conservation of our heritage sites and the preservation of our  culture.  It
demands conditions in which every sector of society can join hands  to  make
a unique treasure accessible to our nation and its visitors, and  to  ensure
that future generations will have the same privilege.

Let us all become part of a living monument in celebration of life. We  must
continue to vigorously promote our national  symbols,  particularly  in  our
schools. I believe that all of us who consider ourselves true patriots  must
leave these quarters with a clear task when we get back to our  communities.
Last September, we called upon  our  people  in  Mpumalanga  to  form  local
community heritage societies whose responsibility would be to encourage  the
discovery, recording and popularisation of local history and heritage  sites
in their various communities.

We also asked the private sector and others to  contribute  to  our  overall
heritage project of documenting the transition of the  last  decade  or  so.
Some of these have started, under  the  able  guidance  of  our  traditional
leaders and historians in the province.  We  will  continue  the  good  work
started by our communities. Among the things that we  asked  our  people  to
consider was a dedicated agency that will be  responsible  for  consistently
collating, assessing and producing  in  a  popular  form  our  heritage  and
history.

A key issue in the development of  indigenous  languages  is  the  issue  of
language in  education,  including  mother-tongue  instruction  at  entrance
levels, and encouraging multilingualism and language in higher education.  A
few weeks ago, in Barberton, we reminded  the  public  broadcaster  and  the
publishing industry that they, too, have important  roles  to  play  in  the
promotion of our cultural heritage and the development of our languages.

Let me stress that we need to find a new sense of pride in who  we  are  and
what we can achieve. We have to, as South Africans, be loyal to the  economy
and should stimulate job creation through being proudly  South  African  and
buying  proudly  South  African  goods.  An  increased  demand  on   locally
manufactured goods and services will no doubt help to grow the  economy  and
cultivate job creation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnu M GUNGUBELE (Gauteng): Sekela-Mongameli welizwe lethu  uMzantsi  Afrika,
sihlalo olawula le ntlanganiso neSekela lakho, iinkulumbuso zonke  ezilapha,
abaphathiswa kumanqanaba esizwe nawamaphondo, amalungu  ale  ndawo  esikuyo,
zindwendwe eziphawulekayo, ndiyabulisa.

Uyabona, le ndawo sikuyo ngoku  ukususela  ngonyaka  ka-1994  ikwenza  uzive
urhawuzelelwa xa ufuna  ukuthetha  ngayo.  Ukuba  ubuyimbongi  ubungathi  xa
uyibiza uthi ngu "Tye leengqwangi; ngungqwangi  nanqilo,  umnta  kaPlangana,
ugoduka Ncede wafa yindlala, unced' encikane yokophisela".

Ukuba ibiyinkunz' enkomo okany' ikhwange, ubungathi ngu"Rhawurhawu,  urhamba
liyathwethwa,   elingathwethweli   mna   lithwethwel'   amankazana,   umfaz'
onobubel' agcin' abantwana, kuba zonk' intombi ziyatshila".

Yindlela ke le obungabonisa ngayo ukuthanda le ndawo sikuyo  ukususela  ngo-
1994. Ubungathi ngu"Siximba kaXolothi" xa uthanda,  ubuz'  ukuba  "ngaba  la
mathumb' ale hagu ngaway' onke na?" Yindlela ke leyo  esiyithanda  ngayo  le
ndawo esikuyo. Sonwabile, sivuyela ukukhululeka.

Laa  nto  ke  yokuvuyela  ukukhululeka  ikwenza  udelele  nokudelela,  ngoba
ungummi opheleleyo. Awumanga mntwini,  unikwe  ithuba  lokuba  ume  ngezakh'
iinyawo, ukwenzela into yokuba sikuthembe xa  umi  ngeenyawo  zakho  zombini
ukuba akusayi kuthi xa  abanye  besiwa  nawe  uwe,  ngoba  uhamba  ngeenyawo
zakho. Ingozi xa ungahambi ngeenyawo zakho kukuba kuthi  kusakuwa  le  ndawo
ubambelele kuyo, nawe uye. Siyayibulela ke le nkululeko esinike  elo  thuba,
Sekela-Mongameli.

Sibulela  na  le  nto,  Sekela-Mongameli,  yokuba   uqinisekise   ngomzekelo
osakhele wona. Ndikhe ndabukela  owayesakuba  ngumongameli  ebizwa  nguLouis
Luyt, emsa enkundleni yamatyala.  Wanqandwa  wancanywa,  esithi  yena  ufuna
ukuya phaya kuba akamkhulwanga ukugqitha bani.  Sibulela  kuSekela-Mongameli
ophinde naye wawubonisa loo mzekelo.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr M GUNGUBELE (Gauteng): Deputy President of our  country,  South  Africa,
Chairperson presiding over this meeting and your deputy,  all  the  premiers
present, national Ministers and provincial MECs, members of the place  where
we are and distinguished guests, I greet you.

You see, the situation in which we have  have  found  ourselves  since  1994
makes one have an itchy feeling when you want to  speak  about  it.  If  you
were a poet, you would have called it "the Rock of the Backbakiri  bird",  a
boor, the child of Noplangana, the "go-home" warbler,  the  "you'll  die  of
hunger", the tiny warbler to bleed onto.

If it was a bull or  a  gelded  one,  you  would  have  given  it  the  name
"Rhawurhawu" [a harrier], one who, like a puff adder, sneaks not towards  me
but towards unmarried women; a kind woman will then be taking  care  of  the
children because all the girls are dancing.

This is how you would have shown your love for the situation  we  have  been
in since 1994. You would have called it "Siximba of Xolothi". If  you  like,
you could ask whether all these are the intestines  of  this  pig.  That  is
what we liken the situation to  that  we  are  in.  We  are  excited,  happy
because we are free.

The thing of being free makes one feel contempt,  because  you  are  a  full
citizen. You don't depend on someone. You have been  given  the  opportunity
to stand on your own feet, so that we trust in you when you are standing  on
your two feet, as you will not also fall if others fall, as  you  walk  with
your own feet. The danger is in the fact that you also fall if you  are  not
walking on your own feet. We are then grateful to the freedom that  gave  us
that opportunity, Deputy President.

We also thank you, Deputy President, for making sure about the  example  you
have set for us. I watched with admiration when  the  former  President  was
summoned to court by Dr Louis Luyt. People tried in vain  to  stop  him.  He
said he wanted to go there because he was not greater than anyone. We  thank
the Deputy President for also setting that example.]

Nine years ago a new nation, conceived  on  the  proposition  that  all  its
citizens are equal before the law, was born. Today we  are  discussing  ways
to  cement  and  deepen  democracy  in  our  new  nation  founded,  as   the
Constitution says, "on the belief that South Africa belongs to all who  live
in it, united in diversity and also thriving in it".

South Africa has taken many strides, away from its  past  of  exclusion  and
discrimination on the basis of sex, colour and creed. The country  has  been
steadily moving in a direction that reasserts our humanity.  In  this  march
towards humanity a new culture of human rights and respect for  the  dignity
of the human spirit has become characteristic of South Africa.

One of the symbolic moments of the exodus from the past was the  raising  of
the new flag in 1994. The moment aptly affirmed the pride and dignity of  an
unfolding  country  and  the  celebration  of  humanity.  Another  was   the
unveiling of a new coat of  arms  on  27  April  2000,  which  embraced  the
collective historical essence of the people of the country.
The democratic dispensation in South  Africa  has  ushered  in  a  range  of
freedoms and opportunities for many South African citizens. In a  few  days'
time this new nation will celebrate its heritage on 24 September,  and  this
will be a day to celebrate the achievements of our new  democracy.  It  will
also be a day to remember the contribution of many women and  men  who  made
great sacrifices to bring freedom to South Africa.

Some of the achievements  are  the  promotion  of  multilingualism  and  the
development of marginalised languages.  The  most  important  part  in  this
promotion, Chairperson, or chairlady, whatever, is that ...

... ukubaluleka kokukhuliswa kweelwimi zonke eMzantsi  Afrika  ungakuqaphela
ukuba ngaba wawukhe wolusa, wahlala  kwindawo  ekungathethwa  silungu  kuyo.
Uya kufumanisa ukuba angakanani na amandla olwimi lwakho  ekwakheni  isizwe.
Ukuba wawuyazi le ntaka kuthiwa licelu, indlela emile  ngayo  kunye  nezimbo
zayo; ukuba wawulazi igwangwa  nehlungulu,  uwazi  umhluko  phakathi  kwazo;
ukuba  wawuzazi  iintlanzi,  ukwazi  ukwahlula  ingephe  entlanzini,   zithi
zakuchazwa  ngesilungu  uluthandabuze  olwaa  lwazi  wawunalo,  kube  ngathi
uyaqala ukufunda ngazo. Ukuthetha ulwimi olungelulo olwakho kuyingozi  kuloo
ndawo.  Ibaluleke  ngolo  hlobo   ke   into   yokukhulisa   zonke   iilwimi.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[... the importance of making all languages in South Africa grow,  something
that you can see; if you were once a herdsman, and lived in  an  area  where
English is not spoken, you will realise the strength  of  your  language  in
building the nation. If  you  knew  the  wagtail  bird,  its  structure  and
behaviour; if you knew the pied crow and the ring-necked  raven,  and  could
distinguish between them; if you knew  fishes,  and  could  distinguish  one
from the other,  when  these  are  described  in  English,  you  doubt  that
knowledge that you have, then it is as though you learn about them  for  the
first time. Speaking a language which is not  yours  is  dangerous  in  that
respect. That is how important it is to make all languages grow.]

The participation of communities  in  the  preservation  and  management  of
heritage resources, including the establishment of heritage bodies  such  as
the  provincial  heritage  resources  authority  and  geographic  names   in
provinces, as well as the celebration of  our  unity  in  diversity  through
commemorative days, particularly our Heritage Day, all  help  us  to  ensure
that we continue to  perpetuate  a  heritage  base  that  ensures  that  our
dignity does last.

Many nations across the globe have engaged in  various  wars.  Amongst  many
reasons that lead to these wars is the lack of tolerance, and we  are  happy
to have a nation that has been able to demonstrate its ability  to  actually
accommodate one another.

 We are, again, also  happy  to  remind  ourselves  that  it  is  proper  to
remember that recently a publication from the SA Human Rights Commission  on
civil society and  governance  in  South  Africa,  1994-2000,  reveals  that
social identity in South Africa seems to have  diversified,  with  more  and
more people preferring to  be  identified  as  South  Africans  rather  than
whites and blacks, and these are the  achievements  we  need  to  celebrate.
This is a good indication that  we  are  succeeding  in  building  a  strong
national identity in South Africa.

Mr Deputy President, the fundamental and pivotal  task  of  our  Government,
therefore, remains the  creation  of  a  united,  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
democratic South Africa.

Ke ndifuna ukuvala ngolu hlobo, Mhlalingaphambili: Kuya kusixaka ke  ukwakha
eli  lifa  ukuba  ngaba  asixolelani  ngokufanayo.  Lo  Rhulumente  uthe  xa
ethabatha iintambo zolawulo wavumela ukuba uGeorge Meiring alawule  imikhosi
yethu, sizazi izono  zakhe  ngelaa  xesha  wayephethe  umkhosi  wamamgxagxa.
Savuma ukuba nabanye, abanjengooFivus, nabo balawule.

Kuba yingozi ke ukuba xa kusithiwa  kupapashwa  kwisaziso  ukuba  kungenzeka
ukuba uMcBright aphathe amapolisa, athukwe ngumhlaba wonke kuba  waye  wenza
umsebenzi  wokulwela  inkululeko,  ethunywe  ngumbutho  wenkululeko  phantsi
kweempembelelo zenkululeko; kukhale wonke umntu xa kusenzeka  loo  nto.  Loo
nto ithetha ukuthi asixolelani ngokulinganayo.

Siyacela ke ukuba kuxolelwane ngokulinganayo ukwenzela ukuba  ilifa  silidle
ngokubonakalayo  ubusuku  nemini,  iiyure  ezingama  24  ngemini,  neentsuku
ezisixhenxe ngeveki. [Kwaphela ixesha.] (Translation of isiXhosa  paragraphs
follows.)

[So, I want to conclude, Chairperson, by saying that building this  heritage
will be difficult for us if we are not reconciled in a similar manner.  When
this Government took over the reigns of power, it allowed George Meiring  to
be in control of our army, whilst knowing his sins when he  was  in  control
of the Boers' army. It also allowed others like Fivus to be in control.

It becomes dangerous, when it  is  published  that  Mc  Bride  might  be  in
control of the police, and the entire world swears at  him  because  he  was
once  engaged  in  fighting  for  freedom,  having  been  instructed  by   a
liberation movement in the context of freedom, and everybody complains  when
that happens. That means we are not reconciled in a similar manner.  We  ask
that reconciliation be done in a  similar  manner,  so  that  we  enjoy  the
heritage day and night, 24  hours  a  day  and  seven  days  a  week.  [Time

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call upon Cllr  H  Jenkins,  the
Deputy Chairperson of Salga.

Cllr  H  JENKINS  (Salga):  Hon  Chairperson,  His  Excellency  the   Deputy
President of the Republic of  South  Africa  the  hon  Mr  Jacob  Zuma,  hon
members of the NCOP,  dignitaries,  invited  guests,  comrades,  ladies  and
gentlemen, on  behalf  of  the  national  leadership  of  Salga  and  member
municipalities, it is indeed an honour  and  a  privilege  to  address  this
House on the theme of our common heritage.

As we approach yet another milestone in our brief history  as  a  democracy,
namely a decade of freedom,  it  is  prudent  and  hopefully  beneficial  to
reflect on the collective role of Government in the advancement of  national
values, values which contribute to our heritage - a heritage which makes  us
proud as a nation and the envy of the world.

It was only recently that peace-  and  freedom-loving  South  Africans  were
engaged in bitter wars of resistance and the struggle  for  liberation  from
pigmentocratic misrule. It is through  our  collective  courage,  conviction
and sacrifice and, eventually, for many, by paying the supreme  price,  that
we  have  secured  peace  and  freedom  in  our  lifetime  and  for   future
generations.

The words of the African elder, speaking about mother  earth,  give  meaning
to the African being, which is entirely apt in the context  of  our  various
struggles as a people. The elder remarked, and I quote:


  If you dig the earth in this Lusaka, you will find me
  If you dig and dig, you will find me, and still
  If you dig and dig and dig,
  And even if you use the big machines, which the human race has  made,  to
  dig and dig and dig to the fathomless bottom
  There you will find me in the earth.
  I am an African.

Salga, for its part, has committed itself to the renewal and revival of  our
continent, for the world must behold that we are firmly located  within  the
African century. To this end, Salga pays homage to the labour  of  the  men,
women and children who sacrificed their lives for  nonracialism,  nonsexism,
democracy, stability, prosperity and peace in our beloved country.

As  a  fledgling  democracy  just  about  to  celebrate  its  10th  birthday
anniversary, we are indeed indebted to these fallen heroes and heroines  who
paid the ultimate price in order that we,  who  have  remained  behind,  can
live in freedom.

Salga proclaims to the nation that the souls of these valiant soldiers  must
rest in peace, as we have secured a Constitution that will ensure  democracy
and peace, and we will let  the  words  of  President  Mbeki  resonate  with
determination in our hearts and strengthen our resolve.

Wherever we may be, whatever our immediate interest,  however  much  baggage
we carry from our past, however much we have been caught by the  fashion  of
cynicism and loss of faith in the capacity of the people, let us  err  today
and say, "Nothing can stop us now."

As leaders we are under obligation to enshrine in  our  consciousness  as  a
caring nation that our heritage as Africans, in terms of past  injuries  and
atrocities, must be repaired.  The  wholesale  reparation  of  colonial  and
apartheid crimes must  be  the  restoration  of  the  African  spirit,  both
individually and collectively.

It is in the grand and noble nature of our wider heritage that Salga -  and,
by extension, municipalities - is restoring the  dignity  of  our  populace.
Although service delivery to our communities has improved tenfold since  the
ejection of the previous junta, we do realise that  much  work  lies  ahead,
especially in terms of electrification, basic housing and the  provision  of
water.

Salga's participation in intergovernmental structures  and  its  partnership
with Government will continue so that we have a nation high on  contentment,
and free from joblessness, poverty and all the  unsavoury  aspects  of  life
that negate one's basic dignity.

We have truly arrived as  a  nation  and,  with  Salga's  proximity  to  the
people, we are certain that we will build positively on and  strengthen  our
heritage for generations to come. With this, I want to put the challenge  to
the Premier of the Northern Cape, Premier  Manne  Dipico,  to  showcase  the
Namastad at the tourism celebrations in Upington "soos net ons in die Noord-
Kaap dit kan doen" [as only us in the Northern Cape can do].

Chairperson, I thank you for the opportunity to share  these  thoughts  with
you. [Applause.]

INkosi N J  NGUBANE  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chairperson,  our  hon  Deputy
President, hon premiers, hon MECs and the hon House, I have  been  requested
by my premier to come and read his speech here.

Almost 10 years after the time of our political liberation, our country  can
rightly celebrate its main achievements, many  of  which  have  indeed  been
true miracles. In the past 10 years, this Government has achieved far  above
the expectations of many. Throughout South Africa there has been an  intense
process of transformation that has changed our country in many respects  and
often for the better. We have achieved a lot in a period  of  10  years.  We
have also moved  forward  in  making  significant  progress,  especially  in
respect of processes requiring a timeframe that,  of  necessity,  is  longer
than 10  years,  as  such,  regarding  the  agenda  for  reconciliation  and
recognition of the multicultural nature of our society.

We  must  now  focus  on  those  aspects  of  our  process  of  growth   and
transformation that have not received sufficient attention,  or  in  respect
of which the demands of our society and the needs of our people may  or  are
not being matched by what has been  achieved.  There  are  many  aspects  in
respect of which we need to do more to perform better. Amongst them  is  our
war on HIV/Aids, which ought  to  become  our  first  priority  in  all  our
actions as Government. My province is terribly  affected  by  this  pandemic
and we are suffering not only because of the disease  but  also  because  of
the insufficient and ineffective actions and  policies  through  which  this
pandemic has thus far been dealt with. History will judge us very harshly.

We are also struggling  with  one  of  the  country's  highest  unemployment
rates, which highlight how, in the past 10  years,  unemployment  has  grown
dramatically in spite of the great economic growth achieved by our  country.
We must also deal with the issue of  poverty  in  the  rural  areas.  In  my
province, there is now much more poverty, hunger,  malnutrition  and  social
destruction in rural areas than 10 years ago. It is saddening that  for  the
poorest of the poor,  our  liberation  has  not  marked  an  improvement  on
conditions but rather a deterioration.

I carry the responsibility for the safety and security portfolio  within  my
province, which, as you all know, is more of a nominal  responsibility  than
having actual powers and functions to do something  significant  to  improve
on the situation of law and order in our province. Crime is out  of  control
and is affecting everyone indiscriminately. For this  reason,  I  feel  that
we, as a country, must recognise that something has gone wrong in  the  past
10 years. We need to create a  new  culture  of  ethics,  law  abidance  and
respect for the rule of law.

There has thus far been too much crime and  corruption  and  it  seems  that
neither crime nor corruption know any boundaries and affect each  and  every
one of us. We need to turn this situation around. It would be  difficult  to
discuss the issues that affect the multicultural nature of our  society  and
we need to reconcile the conflicts which still stem from the legacy  of  our
past. We cannot do so  until  and  unless  we  create  a  society  in  which
everyone can feel equally safe and protected under  the  rule  of  law.  The
culture of crime is becoming prevalent,  whether  it's  a  matter  of  petty
crime or large-scale crime, and it becomes intertwined with the  culture  of
corruption.

It is painful, but we must have  the  courage  to  acknowledge  it  and  the
courage to speak about it openly. We must admit that throughout the  African
continent, crime and corruption have been  some  of  the  strongest  factors
that inhibit progress, development and international direct  investment.  We
are seeing the same monster raising its  head  in  our  country.  Crime  and
corruption do not stem from the policies  and  laws  which  this  Parliament
adopts. We have good  policies  and  our  laws  are  sufficient  to  address
criminal  phenomena.  Crime  and  corruption  arise  from  the  inaction  of
Government in implementing and enforcing its laws. For example,  when  crime
and corruption are not fought for ever, they keep appearing.

We need to provide much better resources in  the  fight  against  crime  and
corruption, including more policemen who are  better  trained,  better  paid
and provided with  greater  resources,  together  with  a  stronger,  better
equipped  and  more  highly  trained  judiciary.  Together  and  with   more
resources, we need to back our fight against crime and corruption  with  the
actual political will to recognise the magnitude of the problem, the  threat
it poses to our democracy and our economic growth; and  the  willingness  to
tackle it with the measure of effectiveness that is objectively required.

When the forces of democracy took over  the  reigns  of  our  Government  in
1994, the first thing we did was to reprioritise  Government's  spending  to
allocate it towards the pressing priorities of our people, especially  those
priorities that had been  neglected  until  then.  Together  with  financial
reprioritisation, we  reprioritised  the  political  will  to  tackle  those
problems.

I feel that we have reached a junction in our history where we must  do  the
same in respect of our war on HIV/Aids  and  the  fight  against  crime  and
corruption. We need the same shift of attitude  and  a  government  that  is
willing to bring it about. It requires building national consensus on a  new
set of priorities in a serious, credible and  effective  manner.  Those  are
priorities  that  address  the  issues  of  HIV/Aids,  unemployment,  crime,
poverty - especially in the rural areas - and the issue of corruption.

This can only happen if the Government that is in power  respects  the  full
commitment to the rules of the game which, unfortunately, have been cast  in
doubt because of the way in which the crossing-of-the-floor legislation  was
passed and our Constitution tampered with to amend the rules of the game  in
order to achieve political  objectives  which  could  not  be  achieved  ...

... today we are here, in this august  House,  to  celebrate  our  unity  in
diversity. We  celebrate  our  achievements  since  1994.  We  are  here  to
celebrate what has been achieved since the glorious  day  of  27  April,  on
which the majority of our people in their numbers  said  never  again  would
South Africans be dominated on the basis of their  race,  culture,  language
and religion.

[Deputy Chairperson, let us celebrate our Constitution, which allowed us  to
have this House in which we  are  sitting  today,  which  brings  the  three
sections of the Government of South Africa together. It is a House in  which
we are able to discuss development and the kind of life that should be  made
available to the different people of South Africa.]

On this occasion of the debate on our heritage, allow me to reflect back  on
what happened in our history, where the  majority  of  South  Africans  were
subjugated by the system of apartheid. In doing so, I wish to highlight  how
Afrikaner nationalism  and  apartheid  rule  was  formed,  what  formed  the
subjugation, how it was used and how this form of  subjugation  led  to  the
demise of apartheid.

In order to sustain itself, apartheid used ethnicity amongst  other  things,
as a basis for justifying its  existence,  self-determination  and  separate
development. Language was used as a basis of  justifying  why  black  people
should stay in their own separate  Bantustans.  Blacks  were  denationalised
and made foreigners in their own country. The Bantustan system  was  founded
on the basis of land dispossession of African  people,  which  ensured  that
hunger compelled blacks to the labour market.

The creation of the impoverished  Bantustan  system  made  it  possible  for
blacks to be dominated and controlled by the white minority, given the  fact
that they became economically dependent on the manufacturing sector.  Blacks
became the outsiders. They were excluded in their own country.

Attempts were made to use education as a  tool  of  domination  and  control
over the majority of this country. Missionary schools, which were  perceived
as institutions that enlightened blacks, were  abolished.  In  this  regard,
I'm reminded of the words of the late  Hendrik  Verwoerd  who  said  that  a
black child should never be taught mathematics and engineering,  because  if
a black child was taught mathematics, who would sweep the streets?

Let us also remember that in 1976, an attempt was also made to use  language
as a means of domination, but due to the gallant struggles of the  youth  of
the time, this never succeeded. I'm here  also  saying  that  the  likes  of
Mondli  Gungubeles  and  the  Penny  Majodinas  were  there  to  fight   the
government of the day to make sure that they did not succeed.

Today, we still have the  remnants  of  the  past  who  still  want  to  use
education and culture to justify separate development, but they  will  never
survive. The forces of change  will  prevail.  We  shall  never  forget  the
heroic struggle of the youth in 1976 against  language  domination.  Through
these struggles, the youth of this country  was  mobilised  to  further  the
struggles against apartheid. The youth of this country realised  that  there
were other forms of domination which extended beyond the classroom,  against
which they fought.

Religion was also used as a tool of subjugation. I'm reminded of  the  times
when even the Dutch Reformed Church became a dominant church  recognised  by
the regime of this country. The state attempted to use  the  church  as  the
basis for separate development, but due  to  the  heroic  struggles  of  the
clergy, the state was defied and the  church  became  another  site  of  the
struggle.

The Mass Democratic Movement also used culture as another tool to fight  the
apartheid onslaught. Amongst  other  things,  cultural  boycotts  became  an
effective tool which the liberation movement used as  an  onslaught  against
the  apartheid  regime.   I   remember   Madiba's   international   birthday
celebration  in  London  at  which  various  international  cultural  groups
demanded Madiba's release from prison.

Having outlined the historical context of our national  heritage,  allow  me
to  outline  what  we  have  achieved  since  the  ushering-in  of  our  new
democracy. Today we are a blossoming democracy of the  new  millennium,  yet
we are aware of the fact that we have  suffered,  and  the  challenges  that
still face us.

We are aware of the need to continue to work together,  aware  of  the  need
for  us  to  contribute  nationally,  regionally   and   globally   to   the
reconstruction of human society. However, let us  rejoice  that  we  have  a
Constitution that honours the integrity and rights of all our  citizens.  We
have a Government with a strong mandate from the people to continue to  work
to transform our country, and we have a  nation  of  people  who  enjoy  the
right to determine their destiny.

Today, Africa is recognised as the cradle of mankind. In  our  part  of  the
continent,  we  have  a  rich  and  varied  past  that  is  only  now  being
appreciated for its complexity and diversity. Indeed, our  heritage  is  the
foundation from which we are working to build our society.

While there are still many challenges to be  met,  poverty  still  gnaws  at
many of our people, disease still threatens our  development,  at  least  we
have a Government that has worked and is working for the  people,  with  the
people.

We are a nation ready to  meet  the  new  millennium,  to  engage  with  the
globalisation,  the  challenges  and  opportunities  of   the   twenty-first
century. We are playing a meaningful role in the  African  Renaissance.  Our
democracy seeks to facilitate an  equitable,  inclusive  and  representative
understanding of our history.

Our Government seeks to redress the neglected legacy  of  our  country.  The
Government is working to ensure that many events or things that  contributed
to who we are today are recognised.  The  ANC  is  seeking  to  redress  the
serious imbalances that existed in the representation  of  our  history  and
ensure that the future generations remember the many people who worked  with
courage to create the free society in which we now live.

The Government is not creating  a  state-sanctioned  and  censored  view  of
history.  Rather,  it  is  providing  the  built  structures  and   symbolic
mechanisms for an equitable and  reconstructualised  representation  of  our
heritage. The Government has ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Deputy Chairperson, His Excellency the Deputy President,  MECs,
hon special delegates, hon colleagues, the  hon  Deputy  President  set  the
tone for the debate by referring eloquently to  our  national  symbols,  the
code of arms, the flag, the national anthem, and he also made references  to
something that is dear to me, our natural flora and fauna  that  constitutes
the real  ingredients  of  national  pride,  national  honour  and  national
heritage. Heritage in an opportunity to celebrate a nation's journey to  its
economic self-sufficiency, political independence and restoration  of  those
aspects of life which  have  been  stifled  or  smothered  during  years  of
subjugation by colonial society.

But let us not look at South Africa in isolation.  I  would  like  to  quote
from the footnotes of Ngugi Wa Thiong'o's Decolonizing the Mind as follows:


  No human disaster can equal in dimension of destructiveness the cataclysm
  that shook Africa. We are all familiar with slave trade and the traumatic
  effect of this on the transplanted black  but  few  of  us  realise  what
  horrors were wrought on Africa itself. Vast populations were uprooted and
  displaced.  Whole  generations  disappeared.   European   diseases   have
  descended like the plague, decimating both cattle and people. Cities  and
  towns were abandoned. Family networks disintegrated,  kingdoms  crumbled,
  the threads of cultural and  historical  continuity  were  savagely  torn
  asunder.

These words form the backdrop I would like to paint before focusing  on  our
Republic of South Africa. For  we  can  only  celebrate  today  if  we  know
yesterday, the past, long before  1913.  No  longer  can  Africa  and  South
Africa be mere postscripts to history.
The hon representative from Salga referred to the  revival  of  the  African
spirit. Can we deny it on occasions such as  this,  when  we  celebrate  our
heritage, when we can almost feel  the  palpable  stirring  of  the  African
spirit?

Observing heritage in South Africa will certainly be celebrating  the  unity
and diversity of a nation that has recently emerged  from  being  a  society
that had been  divided  on  racial  and  ethnic  lines;  from  a  repressive
apartheid era to a democracy in its infancy. There are many things  that  we
can observe and celebrate,  other  countries  observe  and  celebrate  their
heritage in different ways. The common thread is identifying and  preserving
such things as the language, music, literature, arts, religion and  science.
And it is the libraries and museums,  parks  and  gardens,  mountain  peaks,
caves and lakes that give character and shape to a nation's heritage.

South Africans have certainly much to preserve, exhibit and  celebrate.  The
motto on our national coat of arms says it all:  From  diversity  to  unity.
The rainbow nation is  certainly  a  rich  tapestry  of  a  kaleidoscope  of
different cultures, each with its distinct language, religion and  religious
and linguistic characteristics. This world of diversity  must  be  harnessed
and channelled towards a unified nation from being a divided past.

Unfortunately in South Africa sometimes we notice antagonisms  and  tensions
continuing to simmer, even nine years after our first democratic  elections.
There are moments when political tolerance gasps for  breath.  But  we  must
note that South Africa is generally  considered  to  be  rich  in  minerals,
gold, platinum and diamonds. What is sometimes forgotten is  that  the  most
important wealth of the country is its people.

The hon Deputy President referred to the explosion of cultures and that  was
very aptly put. We are an explosion of cultures  like  the  explosion  of  a
multicoloured flower garden.

No country in the world  has,  among  its  population,  such  a  variety  of
different cultures, languages and religions. It is the duty of our  leaders,
political and otherwise, to exploit this  rich  talent  and  wealth  of  our
people. South Africans of all shapes and political  opinion,  ...  years  or
days when colour does not mean anything. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I would like to say, I doubt whether the  Deputy
President is listening. I was going to say to you, Deputy President, that  I
listened carefully to what you said today and I respect what  you  said  and
the spirit in which you said it.

If we examine our freedom and our heritage, we may well ask  what  has  been
the greatest contributor to that freedom. What is the greater  guarantor  of
that liberty? The answer, of course, must lie in  values  we  largely  share
and have mobilised; and the  principles  that  flow  from  values;  and  the
policies those values give rise to. We know in South Africa  what  separates
us. We are experts on the subject. Sameness is  not  unity.  Unity  lies  in
respecting, understanding and accepting the diversity  of  our  country  and
not allowing for  any  differences  to  be  debilitating  or  to  become  an
obstruction to living out one's life to one's full potential.

We South Africans need to harness the centrifugal  forces  in  our  society;
those things that  hold  us  together,  that  unite  us  and   diminish  the
centripetal forces that threaten to pull our nation apart, as our  colleague
from Natal, Nkosi Ngubane, also spelt out quite well this morning.

One of those great centrifugal forces in our society  is  the  value  system
most of us share, which flows from our common  Christian  heritage.  With  a
few exceptions the most successful states in the  world  that  have  escaped
tyranny and  poverty  most  successfully  are  those  states  that  are  the
inheritors of those values and that apply those principles and drivers.  And
what are those drivers?

Those drivers are love, which  the  Deputy  President  spoke  about,  faith,
honour, order, duty, truth, integrity, tolerance,  diligence,  perseverance,
hard  work,  respect  for  family  and  authority,  humility,  selflessness,
forgiveness and tolerance.

The distinguishing features that underpin societies founded on those Judaeo-
Christian norms and values include: Respect for life, law and order,  peace,
a hard currency,  independence  from  others  and  the  dependence  on  God,
limited government, freedom of  religion  and  worship,  growing  democracy,
charity, stability, health, chastity, kindliness,  generosity,  a  sense  of
maintenance, eternal  vigilance,  never  pinning  one's  faith  on  princes,
separation between Church and state, freedom of  the  press,  honouring  and
putting a high premium on property ownership, an independent  judiciary  and
an intergenerational view of life.

Lying at the heart of  the  Christian  conscience  is  a  human  desire  for
liberty - the freedom to choose between right and wrong, to make conscience-
driven choices. At the worldly level, the rules that govern  us;  that  flow
from our values, ideally should be made in democratic  parliaments,  founded
under God. If  those  parliaments  are  to  survive  they  need  to  have  a
significant ongoing Christian presence to guard those values and norms  upon
which they have been founded. That is what we in the ACDP will seek  to  do.
[Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Thank you, Chairperson. Deputy  President  of  the  Republic,
hon Jacob  Zuma,  hon  premiers  of  our  provinces,  distinguished  special
delegates, hon members, fellow  colleagues,  friends  and  comrades,  as  we
celebrate the heritage month, we do so with a great  sense  of  pride,  duty
and urgency because ours is a nation in the making, emerging from a past  of
deep polarisation and inequalities defined by race, gender and class.

To us, as the voice and representatives of our people,  the  celebration  of
heritage month is also a call for  duty  with  a  great  sense  of  urgency,
because we have a historic mission to accomplish - the mission to  eradicate
the legacy of the past in all  its  ramifications  by  building  one  common
national identity. The democratic breakthrough of 27 April 1994,  under  the
leadership  of  the  African  National  Congress,  has  laid  a  solid   and
unbreakable foundation upon which we can all march in  unison  to  create  a
better life for all.

Representing, as it does, the monumental turning point  in  the  history  of
our people and the country, this 1994 democratic breakthrough  will  forever
be a living testimony of a nation breaking ranks with the past in search  of
self-renewal, redefinition, and a common national identity.

In this regard, we salute the courageous leadership of the African  National
Congress and the New National Party for initiating the process  of  peaceful
settlement of our country's conflict. We  are  here,  where  we  are  today,
because of the courageous  leadership  of  Nelson  Mandela  and  the  former
President of the NP, Mr F W de Klerk. That constitutes one of  the  historic
moments in the lives of our people and our country, and it  would  be  wrong
if you are not taking cognisance of that. [Applause.]

Celebrating  national  heritage  is  about  celebrating  the  history  of  a
national  effort  for  development,  a  history  of  sacrifice,   endurance,
commitment and the achievement of humanity in  search  of  peace,  equality,
prosperity and dignity. There is no nation that can appreciate and  preserve
its beauties when it is at war with itself, ravaged by hunger,  homelessness
and diseases, and torn apart by hatred.

The late Secretary-General of the South  African  Communist  Party,  Comrade
Moses Kotane, made the following call to the youth of  our  country,  and  I
quote: "At this hour of destiny, your country and your people need you.  The
future is in your hands and it will be what you make of it."

As a nation in motion for self-renewal and  redefinition,  we  need  to  ask
questions as to whether we have in our efforts created enough  opportunities
for the youth of our country to occupy their rightful place in  society  and
in our struggle for change in particular.

Our inability  to  examine,  from  time  to  time,  how  our  programmes  as
Government impact on the youth has a potential to destroy  the  very  common
national identity we seek to construct. I am sure those who were leaders  in
1976 will agree with me that their failure to listen to the demands  of  the
youth of this country has flung this country into a crisis on 16 June  1976.
And we are hopeful and confident that our Government,  led  by  the  African
National Congress, is conscious  of  that  reality,  hence  it  has  created
appropriate mechanisms and appropriate policies to address the  inspirations
and interests of young people in this country.

The nine years of democratic rule under the leadership of the ANC present  a
great cause for our youth to celebrate. It has restored the dignity  of  the
African child by, inter alia, deracialising our education system, where  our
children, irrespective of their ethnic, racial  and  class  background,  are
able to be in the same class -  this  was  not  the  case  before  the  1994
democratic dispensation.

Today our children from indigent families, those between  the  ages  of  one
and seven years, are able to receive grants from  Government  thus  enabling
them  to  fulfil  their  responsibilities  of  development,  like  attending
schools and getting educated.

It is we, the generation of today, the generation of young people, that  can
celebrate because our leaders from the ranks  of  the  South  African  Youth
Congress, from the ranks of the Congress  of  South  African  Students,  the
late Comrade Ephraim Mogale, have not died in  vain  when  they  called  for
free, compulsory education for all. Today it is no one  but  the  Government
of the African National Congress that has put that particular  programme  in
place, hence we have free, compulsory education for all from age  one  until
twelve years.

Today we have accessible health care, not only for those  young  people  who
are  in  our  urban  communities  but  even  those  who  are  in  our  rural
communities.

The transformation of  the  higher  education  system  in  our  country  has
enabled  large  numbers  of  entrants  from   the   historically   excluded,
particularly African youth, to become part of the mainstream  education  and
training of our country, thus increasing the  human  resource  base  of  our
country.

We owe it to our forebears again that successive leadership and  generations
of the youth of this country have made this to happen ... [Time expired.]

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Thank you, Sir.

Mr T S SETONA: ... Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, all of us as political leaders are fully  aware
of the enormous challenges that we as a country are  still  facing,  despite
all the successes achieved over the past ten years.

There can be no doubt  that  the  enormous  challenges  of  poverty,  crime,
HIV/Aids,  unemployment,  etc  require  of  us  to  urgently  find   lasting
solutions. We will however only succeed in this  if  we  as  South  Africans
from all communities can succeed in overcoming our divided past and  embrace
our common future. The challenges facing  us  are  such  that  we  can  only
succeed if we all take hands and together build our common future.

We must acknowledge how far we have come on the road to reconciliation,  and
in that spirit approach our outstanding challenges.  If  we  think  back,  a
mere 10 to 14 years, and remember how close we came to a  bloody  civil  war
in this country which would have destroyed our country, we  indeed  have  so
much to rejoice about and in humility thank our God for.

A number of recent events have, however, proved  that  real  nation-building
and  lasting  reconciliation  in  South  Africa  remains  one  of  the  most
important pressing and elusive needs for  our  people.  It  is  one  of  the
founding principles of the agreement between the New NP and the ANC that  we
must build a national consensus  founded  on  South  African  patriotism  to
deracialise our country and build tolerance and understanding.

In 1990  when  President  De  Klerk  announced  the  end  of  apartheid  and
positioned the New NP as a party of Africa, not simply in  Africa,  the  New
NP chose  power  sharing  and  a  multiparty  government.  It  received  the
overwhelming endorsement of the minority communities for  this  approach  of
being part of the debate, not out  of  the  debate.  This  resulted  in  the
Government of National Unity. In retrospect, it was a big  mistake  for  the
New NP to withdraw from the GNU in favour of the  Westminster  model.  There
were, however, flaws that had to be corrected.

In 1999 the New NP again received a mandate to  work  towards  an  inclusive
government,  but  unfortunately  went  into  an  alliance   with   the   DP.
[Laughter.] When it, however, soon became clear that  the  DP  component  of
the DA was not interested in constructively engaging the Government and  was
hellbent on its fight back style of politics, with the  philosophy  of  what
is bad for the country is good for the DA, the New NP  pulled  out  of  that
alliance,  and  again  established  participatory  government  through   its
agreement with the ANC.

In this new model the problems of the GNU, such as the right of a  party  to
differ in public on issues on which consensus cannot be reached,  have  been
corrected.

Die besluit deur die Nuwe NP en die ANC in 2001  om  op  alle  regeringsfere
saam te werk, en in eenheid en doel te ontwikkel  om  die  groot  uitdagings
wat Suid-Afrika in die gesig staar gesamentlik die  hoof  te  bied,  bly  'n
dryfkrag agter die proses van versoening.  Soos  ons  ons  tiende  jaar  van
demokrasie binne gaan, is dit ons twee partye wat voortgaan om  wag  te  hou
oor die proses van versoening en die verdieping van demokrasie in ons  land.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The decision by the New NP and  the  ANC  in  2001  to  co-operate  on  all
spheres of government, and to develop in  unity  and  purpose  in  order  to
jointly deal with the challenges facing  South  Africa,  remains  a  driving
force behind the process of reconciliation. As we enter our  tenth  year  of
democracy it is our two parties that will continue to guard the  process  of
reconciliation, as well as the deepening of democracy in our country.]

Whilst we should never lose sight of how far we have  come  since  1990,  we
must also recognise that there are still many South Africans,  unfortunately
from all communities, who remain trapped by the mistakes of  our  past,  and
whose fears and racial prejudices are easily awakened.

Whilst the ANC and the New NP are working tirelessly to build tolerance  and
understanding, there are political parties like the DA  who  manipulate  and
exploit  these  fears  and  prejudices  for  their  own  narrow   short-term
political gain. We have seen this during  the  recent  by-elections  and  in
their  speeches  and  responses  to  the  Restitution  of  Land  Rights  and
Education Amendment Bills  recently,  where  they  have  made  use  of  half
truths, and sometimes blatant  lies,  in  their  attempts  to  whip  up  the
emotions, fears and prejudices of minority groups.

From the results of some of these by-elections  it  is  unfortunately  clear
that in the short-term they are succeeding in misleading  some  people  with
their false propaganda by giving them a kind of temporary warm feeling  that
they will somehow miraculously solve every problem in  this  country  almost
overnight. This is, however, the same kind of warm  feeling  which  a  small
child gets when he or she wets him or herself. [Laughter.]  Like  this  warm
feeling that a small child experiences for a few moments before  he  or  she
becomes very uncomfortable, so this warm feeling experienced by people,  who
have been misled  by  the  false  and  unrealistic  propaganda  of  the  DA,
disappears like mist before the sun when they are exposed to  the  light  of
the truth and to the realities of the new South Africa.

In reality the DA has  not,  cannot,  and  will  not  be  able  to  put  one
policeman or policewoman on the streets of South Africa;  has  not,  cannot,
and will not be able to build one house in South Africa; and this is  so  in
respect of each and every challenge or problem that  we  as  South  Africans
face. The DA very temporarily only has some influence in  KwaZulu-Natal  and
in a few municipalities which they only got through their  earlier  alliance
with the New NP.

The National Party under the leadership of former  President  De  Klerk  and
the ANC under the leadership of former President Nelson Mandela,  talked  to
each other, negotiated with each other, governed together  in  the  interest
of all the people of this country. Today the New National  Party  under  the
leadership of Premier  Marthinus  van  Schalkwyk,  and  the  ANC  under  the
leadership of President Thabo Mbeki ... [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Thank you.

Mr P A MATTHEE: ... I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr E RASOOL  (Western  Cape):  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson,  Deputy
President, Premiers, MECs, members of  this  House.  I  want  to  thank  the
Deputy President for the leadership he has shown  in  reminding  us  of  our
obligations in this month  of  heritage  and  preparing  us  for  the  tenth
celebrations that we will have. But I also want to thank him for taking  the
lead in not being afraid to speak about the  situation  in  which  he  finds
himself, because I think that becomes the hallmark of the kind of  democracy
that we want.

And it is not an irony that  we  go  to  the  tenth  year  with  the  Deputy
President being accused of certain things, because there are some  among  us
who would want to assert that the only legacy of the last 10 years would  be
matters  relating  to  corruption.  Whereas  the  issues  that  the   Deputy
President led us on today show that our legacy in this country is  far  more
than the blips of corruption, alleged or real, that have  occurred  in  this
country and that the legacies indeed are so deep that it goes to the  levels
of service delivery, the levels of unity and  reconciliation  that  we  have
been able to build and the levels of a society that is far more  in  harmony
with itself than ever before.

I want to  speak  very  briefly  about  the  one  question  that  has  vexed
political leaders in the Western Cape for all the time that  we  have  known
it - the issue of the national question in the Western Cape,  the  issue  of
the relationships between the different racial communities  in  the  Western
Cape. I want to say, Deputy President,  that  there  have  been  significant
shifts in the national question of the Western Cape in the last  19  months.
We have not reached anywhere near where we should be, we  have  not  reached
anywhere near perfection, but we believe we have the basic  ingredients  for
a solution that will begin to solve  and  lay  to  rest  the  vexing  issues
around the national question  in  the  Western  Cape.  I  think  it  results
largely from the kind of political change that the hon  Pieter  Matthee  has
spoken about, because we are building a new common ground, a new  centre,  a
new political dispensation within the Western Cape that is inclusive  rather
that exclusive, that works on the common ground  rather  than  exploits  the
differences that leads to fears and hostilities  among  the  people  of  the
Western Cape.

In the ANC Today the President, Thabo Mbeki, reflected on his visit  to  the
Western Cape for three days of imbizos, that we may even  begin  to  believe
that the national battle for nonracialism may finally be fought and  won  in
the Western Cape. After three days of travelling the length and  breadth  of
this province, the President has probably given the most hopeful  sign  that
we  can  lay  to  rest  the  racial  divisions  and  conflicts   that   have
characterised life in the Western Cape. And maybe the key ingredients  would
be around the formula to transform white fears into generosity, to  use  the
resourcefulness, the skills, the wherewithal that  the  white  community  in
this province has built up. However, they may have built it up, but to  say:
Let us turn it into a generosity that contributes to a new dispensation  and
a new attitude towards people of different races. Maybe that  is  the  first
ingredient.

The second ingredient may well  be  to  turn  African  marginalisation  into
African inclusion in the  Western  Cape.  To  overcome  the  legacy  of  the
coloured label preference areas, the Group Areas  Act,  the  Influx  Control
Act that was applied so harshly in the Western Cape and to begin to  say  to
the African community: The Western Cape is as much your home as  it  is  the
home of other communities.

The third ingredient may well be  to  turn  coloured  insecurities  into  an
assurance that the coloured community has a historical right  to  claim  the
Western Cape as their home and need not walk about as  insecure  communities
here who have weathered the storms  of  "swart  gevaar"  in  this  province.
[Interjections.]

We have stabilised the fears that this community,  the  coloured  community,
have of equality, as we  begin  to  understand  that  welfare  needs  to  be
equalised in order to be spread and that we need integrated housing  waiting
lists. It is not a threat to any  particular  community,  that  you  can  no
longer say that Africans cannot be  on  the  housing  waiting  list  of  the
Western Cape. And we need a dispensation and a formula to share  the  scarce
resources of the Western Cape among all  of  our  people.  This  battle  for
nonracialism, I believe can shift into a new gear as  we  enter  the  second
decade of freedom.
Maybe in the second decade of freedom we must  shift  away  from  the  harsh
racial divisions that exist in the Western Cape to  the  true  enjoyment  of
the full cultural, linguistic and religious diversity of our province  while
asserting that we are all South African and asserting at the same time  that
we are all proud Africans of this continent, so that the racial  identities,
which are largely political, of white, coloured and African do  not  remain,
on the one hand, fixed and do not remain, on the other hand, defensive.

That the white community no longer use  the  identity  of  white  to  defend
privileges, but that we may in fact revel  in  the  legacy  of  those  white
communities who speak Afrikaans and have  certain  cultural  practices,  the
rich English legacy that we have in this province and even others  like  the
Portuguese legacy that forms part of this overall white  community  so  that
we can revel in the cultural and linguistic variety  there  rather  than  in
the political identity of ``white''.

That we may  be  able  to  say  to  the  coloured  community:  Do  not  have
solidarity among  yourselves  against  equality  and  against  changes  that
happen in the country, but that we may begin to see  more  how  within  that
coloured community the Malays revel in  their  relationship  with  Malaysia,
Indonesia and Java and see  the  cultural  and  culinary  unities  that  are
building up there. That the Khoi, the San and the Griqua begin to  recognise
that the greatest friend for their own legacy is a government that has  made
their language the centrepiece of our Coat of Arms.

That even the Chinese, who fall in this coloured community,  may  now  begin
to revel in and make their pilgrimages to China, etc. And  that  we  say  to
the African communities of the Western  Cape:  Let  us  no  longer  use  the
notion of being African as an assertion that you have the  right  to  exist,
that you must be in the Western Cape against all  the  oppression  that  has
happened to you, of which you were the victims, in  the  Western  Cape.  But
let us rather say that within that there is a vibrancy that  says  that  the
African communities are at home in the Western Cape. Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Mrs C MABUZA (Limpopo): Chairperson, hon Deputy President, Premiers  present
here, MECs, hon members, ladies and gentlemen, on  behalf  of  Limpopo,  her
people and Premier Advocate Ramatlhodi, I would like to associate  with  the
gratitudes expressed to members of the House by  the  hon  Deputy  President
and other speakers in this House. From all corners of the  country  we  came
here to grapple with the concept that affords us an  opportunity  to  affirm
ourselves as indigenous citizens of this land.

In a month dedicated to heritage celebrations, as alluded to by  the  Deputy
President  earlier,  we  have  assembled  in  this  House  to  reaffirm  our
commitment to the project that seeks to preserve our own cultural  identity.
Once more, we are challenged to acknowledge that heritage, at  the  core  of
which is arts and  culture,  remains  a  prerequisite  for  the  sustainable
development and appropriate legacy to leave behind for  future  generations.
In no uncertain terms, heritage has distinguished itself as a  catalyst  for
nation-building and national  reconciliation.  It  constitutes  an  integral
element  of  the  sound  institutions  that  form  the  cornerstone  of  our
democracy.

On the other hand, heritage is  vital  in  dealing  with  almost  all  South
Africa's development challenges, whether these are  high  illiteracy  rates,
social  welfare,  backwardness,  underdevelopment,  crime  or  the  HIV/Aids
pandemic. The relationship between the cultural component  of  our  heritage
and development is a dynamic one; the two are mutually reinforcing.  So,  by
locating culture at the centre of development, we are bringing in  the  most
important ingredient for the success of our people in  their  forward  march
to a better life.

In more ways than one,  the  preservation  of  our  heritage  is  about  the
development of our  people  -  empowering  them  to  unlock  the  armour  of
talents, skills and ingenuity that is inherent within  human  beings.  Based
on our heritage, works of art have been sourced from the length and  breadth
of Southern Africa, from  townships  to  the  far-flung  rural  areas.  They
reflect the richness and diversity of the cultural tapestry and heritage  of
our country - a country that undoubtedly has the human and natural  resource
potential to play a major role in the global village.

However,  the  challenge  that  remains   is   to   create   platforms   and
infrastructure for this potential to be unlocked.  While  the  globalisation
trend opens up a window of opportunity to showcase  and  market  the  unique
products of our cultural  heritage,  sadly,  all  too  often,  the  benefits
associated with this do not accrue  to  those  people  whose  ingenuity  and
endeavours create the products that are sold in  galleries  in  the  world's
capitals.

The exceptionally well-made pots, produced out of hard clay soil, the  craft
that is involved, the high level of  intellectual  concentration,  the  risk
that goes with the fetching of wood from unsafe  bushes  and  mountains,  is
not equal to the hard labour our people commit to this  work.  Instead,  the
ones who buy these products, and those involved in their trade,  get  richer
at the expense of our people. Our people get condemned to  poverty  for  the
good work they do in the interest of our heritage.

At worse, they are sometimes not even part of  the  decision-making  process
in determining the prices at which their own products should be sold. It  is
high time that we change this ugly scenario. Our people  too,  should  enjoy
the outcomes of their mental  and  manual  labour  power.  In  1992,  Unesco
established the World Commission on Culture and Development, which played  a
pivotal role in highlighting and mainstreaming the role of arts and  culture
in development.

These  efforts  have  been  instrumental  in  focusing  the   attention   of
Governments, development  agencies  and  the  private  sector  on  arts  and
culture as a powerful lever of  economic  growth,  poverty  alleviation  and
human development. Limpopo, like other parts of our country, has  also  been
a beneficiary. In June this year, Unesco declared  Mapungubwe,  situated  in
the northern part of our province, a World Heritage Site.

This positive spin-off  adds  to  the  richness  of  our  flora,  fauna  and
unspoiled habitat we pride ourselves  in  as  the  province.  Having  lately
distinguished ourselves as the preferred tourism destination  for  many,  it
is our considered view that this heritage site will contribute immensely  to
the economic development of the province and the country at large. From  the
marketing and tourism perspective, it presents us with a unique  opportunity
to showcase our province, our rich and varied  cultural  heritage,  and  our
friendly and generous people to the people of the world.

In this  regard,  the  provincial  government,  in  collaboration  with  the
national  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  decided  to
celebrate the Heritage Day at this site. The focus will be, amongst  others,
on educating the public about the significance  of  Mapungubwe  as  a  World
Heritage  Site  and  its  inscription  on  the  World  Heritage  list.   The
University of Pretoria has also been successfully persuaded  to  bring  back
the Mapungubwe heritage collection to where it belongs: Limpopo.

On 5 September 2003, we also hosted  the  national  festival  on  indigenous
games at  the  Peter  Mokaba  Stadium.  Our  games,  which  include  diketo,
morabaraba, dibeke and kgati have been elevated to professional status,  and
participants  can  now  take  part  in  bigger   tournaments   and   related
competitions. I therefore take this opportunity to invite  you,  the  Deputy
President and all other hon members of this House, to  join  the  people  of
Limpopo on the 24 September in celebrating Mapungubwe, as not  only  one  of
the three National Orders in our country, but also the World Heritage  Site.


God is great. Publicly, today in this House, Inkosi  Ngubane  admitted  that
they are not hands-on in Kwazulu-Natal. Crime is increasing.  Corruption  is
the order of the day. HIV/Aids is getting out of control. I think  the  only
political party that can take charge of that province is the ruling party  -
the ANC. [Interjections.] Publicly, he admitted that they  are  failing  us.
We need to implement what is in  the  Bible.  We  need  to  take  people  of
Kwazulu-Natal  out,  from  Egypt  to  the  land  of  Canaan.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr Z A DINGANI (Free  State):  Chairperson  of  the  Council  of  Provinces,
Deputy President of the whole of South Africa, hon members, Premiers,  MECs,
indeed ours has truly been a long,  difficult  but  interesting  journey  of
determination and hope. As we enter the home stretch to the first decade  of
our democracy, our minds and souls remind us  of  the  lap  of  honour  that
awaits us all. As we take this lap  of  honour  as  a  nation,  we  will  be
reminded of our origin and, therefore, our heritage.

The ANC-led Government initiated  the  Letsema  campaign  in  an  effort  to
highlight Government programmes with regard to development,  and  to  engage
our communities  in  developmental  initiatives.  As  part  of  the  Letsema
campaign, and the fact that our calendar indicates September  as  a  tourism
and heritage month, during this month we have been and will be  involved  in
activities that showcase our  rich  heritage  and  promote  tourism  in  the
country and in the different provinces.

As a people we have made a groundbreaking  transition  from  a  divided  and
autocratic  society  to  one  that  is  united  and  celebrates  its  unique
cultures, and proclaims its rich and diverse heritage. Today  we  can  truly
say that we are on the right path towards ensuring unity  through  diversity
in South Africa.

We are proud to report to this House that the Basotho  Cultural  Village  in
Qwaqwa is involved in reviving and promoting the indigenous heritage of  the
Basotho. To achieve  this  objective,  we  are  planning  an  open  day  for
indigenous games on Heritage Day at the Cultural Village.  The  plan  is  to
invite traditional leaders, councillors, business people and  resort  owners
and managers to support this initiative.

Rightfully so, the theme for this heritage  month  focuses  on  popularising
South Africa's national symbols, that is the flag, the coat of arms and  the
national anthem, and on  fostering  understanding  of  the  significance  of
these symbols.

Our Heritage Day celebrations this year in  the  Free  State  are  aimed  at
school children and the wider public in order to promote  awareness  and  an
understanding of our national symbols. One of the objectives we  would  like
to achieve is to get all the citizens to  appreciate  our  national  symbols
and orders and regard them with pride and dignity.

Our continued efforts in this regard, Chairperson,  are  beginning  to  bear
fruit. The provincial government receives a steady stream of  requests  from
schools for some  of  these  symbols,  especially  the  national  flag.  Our
department of education is working hard to facilitate that each school  gets
at least one flag.

We continue, though, to receive reports that some schools  continue  to  fly
the Vierkleur flag. In some cases the national flag  is  flown  upside  down
mainly, we think, because  of  ignorance.  Hence  our  concerted  effort  to
promote awareness and understanding.

We continue to  monitor  with  added  vigilance  the  proper  usage  of  the
national flag.  We  remain  concerned  at  the  inadequate  singing  of  the
national anthem. We  are,  however,  convinced  that  we  are  winning  this
battle.

Our country, Chairperson, has various significant heritage sites  that  have
gained international prominence. It  is  incumbent  upon  every  citizen  to
cherish and understand the significance of these sites.

In the Free State there are numerous heritage sites, which  are  significant
because of their historical and cultural background.  There  are  deliberate
and sustained efforts to promote these sites, first among the people of  the
Free State,  then  among  all  South  Africans  and  ultimately  within  the
international community.

On the arts scene, we are delighted that  during  the  past  year  the  arts
scene in the province has shown  a  vibrant  revival  and  has  become  more
representative of the needs of all the people of our province.  The  opening
of the new underground art gallery at Oliewenhuis in  Bloemfontein  and  the
growing  number  of  successful  craft  markets  in  the  province  are   an
indication that this sector is experiencing renewal.

Our annual cultural festival, Macufe, which  will  be  held  next  month  in
Bloemfontein, continues to grow in stature. More than  52  000  arts  lovers
visited this show last year. It is gratifying,  Chairperson,  to  note  that
about 77% of all artists who performed at Macufe 2002  were  from  the  Free
State. We grow our own timber and we have confidence that  we  will  have  a
bigger and better Macufe this year. All members are invited.

Let us also indicate that the transformation of  heritage  in  this  country
was never going to be an easy  task.  The  heritage  and  history  of  black
communities in our province are generally not depicted in our museums, as  a
result of the policies of the apartheid regime. But, comprehensive  work  is
being undertaken to address this anomaly.

The Free State government, Chairperson, is also satisfied with the  progress
made in the development of  Sesotho  Literary  Museum,  which  is  currently
housed at the National Afrikaans Literary Museum.  The  core  collection  of
Sesotho Literary work is being built.

In  conclusion,  Chairperson,  our  efforts  towards  nation-building   have
surpassed our own imagination. In recognition of the gains we made  in  this
regard, in May this year the Free  State  government,  together  with  civil
society, successfully held a  cleansing  and  healing  ceremony,  where  the
communities of the Free State buried  their  past  and  pledged  that  never
again will the evils of the past be repeated.

A monument was built in the Nelson Mandela Drive next to  the  Bram  Fischer
building to remind the people of the Free State  and  of  our  country  that
never again will the wrongs of the past be tolerated in our  country.  Plans
are also at an advanced stage  to  establish  a  garden  of  remembrance  to
enhance this healing process. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chair, it is widely acknowledged that  South  Africa  is  a
land  of  diverse  people,  with  unique,  rich  cultures,  traditions   and
languages, and also that it is a land blessed with  a  beautiful  landscape,
with  fauna  and  flora.  But  most  importantly,  it  is   recognised   and
acknowledged that all those who live in this country belong to  one  nation,
united in diversity. It can be referred to as  a  multicultural  society  in
which different cultural entities and traditions are  recognised,  respected
and promoted through national  legislation,  as  the  Deputy  President  has
already alluded to.

There are eleven official languages and other languages  that  are  commonly
used by communities in South  Africa.  Government  has  adopted  a  language
policy, as laid out in the Language Policy Framework of  2002,  which  seeks
to  ensure  the  following  principles:  The  promotion  and  protection  of
linguisitic  and  cultural   diversity,   support   of   democracy   through
entrenchment of language equity and language rights, asserting a  view  that
multilingualism is a national  resource  and  encouraging  the  learning  of
other South African languages.

One cannot imagine or speak of the South African heritage  without  speaking
about and acknowledging the past; in particular the  history  of  systematic
racial discrimination and dispossession suffered  by  the  majority  of  its
people under colonialism and apartheid.

That  history  and  the  history  of  the  struggle  against  injustice  and
inequities  are  part  of  its  rich  heritage  and  identity.  The  present
democratic dispensation and the recognition of the need  for  reconciliation
and unity are  part  of  the  ongoing  efforts  towards  building  a  common
identity, patriotism and heritage.
Morago ga 1994 kwa Bokone Bophirima go nnile le ditlhotlhomiso  tsa  paka  e

[After 1994 in the North West investigations were carried  out  against  the
leader of the UCDP for a long time. I have been inquisitive ...]

... I bore a grudge.

Mosong ono go utlwa Motlotlegi Motlatsa Moporesidente  Rre  Zuma  a  ineela,

molao o tswelele ka dikgato  tsa  one.  Jaanong  ke  a  bona  e  bile  ke  a

President Mr Zuma surrender, submitting himself to the  investigations  that
are at present being made into him, saying  that  the  law  should  continue
with its steps. Now I see and understand and I will be fine.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  Deputy  President,  Premiers,
Speakers, MECs, Ms Jenkins, hon members, it is clear from the speech of  the
Deputy President that Heritage Day is about creating a national identity  in
the context of our diverse, multilingual and multicultural society. We  must
all recognise that we come from a past characterised by  conflict,  division
and polarisation, and we  are  moving  towards  a  future  characterised  by
peace, unity and reconciliation. This commitment  enjoins  each  of  us,  as
public representatives, to ensure that we give effect to the spirit  of  our
Constitution of creating a nonracial, nonsexist, prosperous  and  democratic
South Africa.

The confusion  amongst  media  analysts  and  commentators  as  to  what  is
ethical, where to draw the line and how to avoid judgment on  the  basis  of
allegations, reflects a new challenge  to  our  democracy.  Central  to  the
issue, is this question: "How  do  we  balance  the  right  to  dignity  and
privacy against the right to freedom of expression?"

It is appropriate at this juncture to acknowledge  and  recognise  the  pre-
eminent  role  played  by  our  Deputy  President  in  achieving  peace  and
stability in KwaZulu-Natal, Rwanda, Burundi and the DRC.  He  has  conducted
himself as a true African and an authentic leader. What we say, and  how  we
say it, would either contribute to the development  or  the  devastation  of
these ideal aspirations.  In  a  weekly  letter  from  the  opposition,  the
opening sentence, which reflects the co-operative  arrangement  between  the
IFP and the DA, we read the following:


  The great tactic of the Zulu armies that  conquered  vast  areas  of  the
  African hinterland in the 18th and 19th centuries was the horn formation.
  By advancing on two flanks at once, the warriors were  able  to  overcome
  superior force and power.


  The IFP and DA have come together in classic horn formation, advancing on
  two separate flanks, towards achieving the common goal of positive change
  in South Africa.

The statements resonate with militancy and aggression,  a  leap  beyond  the
fight-back campaign  to  a  declaration  of  war.  Of  course,  the  opening
statements are qualified with an interesting refrain:


  Ours is not a call to arms, but a call to  the  conscience  of  each  and
  every South African.

This conscience  that  the  DA  is  appealing  to  is  a  conscience  of  an
individualistic person who shares no sense of responsibility to  the  social
welfare and development of the historically marginalised communities of  our
country. This conscience is premised on the selfish  acquisition  of  wealth
and material benefits, even if it is at the expense of the  poorest  of  the
poor. This conscience that the DA speaks about is not based  on  egalitarian
values and aspirations. It is narrow and parochial. It is the voice  of  the
privileged  which  perennially  argues  against   affirmative   action   and
employment equity. It is a voice of  a  conscience  that  militates  against
improved working conditions and the constitutional  obligations  to  redress
the inequalities of the past.

The ordinary reader may well be  incited  by  the  opening  statements  and,
given the sad history of conflicts  and  violence  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  these
statements may promote irresponsible acts  of  aggression.  However,  it  is
useful to subject these opening statements to closer scrutiny.

The parable of an army with two flanks, in  a  very  subtle  and  subliminal
sense, may suggest a white flank and a black flank, representing the DA  and
the IFP respectively, and again entrenching the divisions of the past.  Then
there is the question of who leads the army reminiscent of  the  great  Zulu
warrior, Chaka. Is it the ageing warrior, or  the  ambitious,  but  deluded,
demagogue?

Will the wisdom of the older warrior prevail over the colossal  ego  of  the
diminutive demagogue? Will the battle begin and end within the ranks of  its
leadership? Who will be in charge, and what is the  chain  of  command?  The
diminutive demagogue may suggest that they should, as they  have,  at  every
opportunity available  discredit  Government,  which  for  purposes  of  the
parable, is the enemy. He hopes that this will erode its strength,  cohesion
and hegemony. The wise, but waning, warrior will correctly  argue  in  these
words, and I quote him not very long ago, and these  are  the  words  of  Dr
Buthelezi:


  We must be big enough and wise enough to acknowledge  that  the  ANC  has
  performed very well in many respects. Without  this  being  acknowledged,
  what we have to say will lack credibility.

And I will ask the hon Nkosi Ngubane to listen to these  words,  because  as
he spoke, in the beginning, he sounded sincere,  clear  and  coherent.  Yet,
when he read the DA script  he  became  very  confused  about  where  he  is
located in this diverse cultural heritage of ours. [Laughter.]

He  wisely  cautions  the  younger  tin  soldier  to   distinguish   between
propaganda and reality. The wise warrior, who  has  been  in  the  arena  of
political struggle for so long, says so because  he  knows  that  there  has
been a qualitative and quantitative change to millions  of  people  who  are
the poorest of the poor.  He  knows  that  we  have  been  oppressed  by  an
uncaring regime in the past.

Surely the old warrior must remember how it has, over the  past  decade,  in
coalition  with  the  ANC,  brought  infrastructure  and  services  to   his
constituents. Certainly, he must be aware that  this  kingdom  receives  the
greatest share of the revenue from amongst all provinces.  Indeed,  he  will
reflect that even though his party does not constitute the majority  in  the
legislature, the fictitious enemy has  permitted  one  of  his  deputies  to
lead.

Most significantly, at this stage of advanced foreplay with the DA, he  must
recognise that he and his members form part of a collective command  of  the
state machinery of this fictitious enemy. He will also remember that  as  we
celebrate arts and culture we do so  with  one  of  his  deputies,  Minister
Ngubane, at the helm of the  portfolio  responsible  for  the  cultural  and
scientific revolution that we are working towards.

Let us now proceed to the most precious heritage of  our  democracy,  namely
the Constitution. The Constitution is a unique heritage  because  it  is  an
inspirational document committed to the improvement of the  quality  of  the
lives of all of our citizens. More importantly, it enshrines  the  supremacy
of the Constitution and the rule of law.

These founding provisions are expanded in the Bill of Rights, which  is  the
cornerstone of  our  democracy.  Yet,  not  withstanding  the  right  to  be
presumed innocent, our detractors - the deluded demagogues - have  taken  it
upon themselves to pass innuendo and judgment on the dignity and  esteem  of
our senior leaders. They  opportunistically  seek  an  intervention  without
respecting the rule of law. And they do so on the basis of  allegations  and
pontificate that they act in the national interest.

Yet, they do not stop there. They question the commitment and  integrity  of
the institutions protecting our  democracy,  which  are  guaranteed  to  act
without fear, favour  or  prejudice.  They  do  so  in  the  knowledge  that
persons,  irrespective  of   their   political   affiliations,   have   been
successfully prosecuted for transgressions of the law, this  notwithstanding
their position  and  power  within  a  political  party.  Yet,  when  it  is
politically expedient for them to do, they impute partially  or  bias,  thus
seeking  to  tarnish  the  institutions  that  support  our   constitutional
democracy.

They  further  insinuate  that  our  President  must  intervene,  and   thus
disregard the rule of law. If he does, they would be  the  first  to  accuse
him of interfering with the due process of law. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Chair, premiers, MECs and  hon  members  of  the
House, I believe that  this  has  been  one  of  the  most  interesting  and
encouraging discussions of the NCOP. We certainly have a  lot  to  celebrate
since 1994. There has  been  a  lot  of  contributions  that  were  made  by
different speakers. They all indicated that we have made progress,  we  have
moved forward and that we have something to celebrate. Even those who  spoke
about other issues such as crime, HIV/Aids and the  crossing  of  the  floor
indicated that something has happened. [Laughter.]

A decade ago - I'm  sure  everybody  will  agree  -  HIV/Aids  was  in  this
country. There was not a single programme in place to deal with  this  issue
by any government, either by the national government or by governments  that
existed at the time. There was not  a  single  programme  in  place.  Today,
everybody agrees and there are comprehensive programmes, including  a  five-
year strategy to deal with this issue.

I think everybody will also agree that a decade  ago,  no  one  could  speak
about crime in this country, let alone a programme to deal with crime.  And,
people were dying  and  many  of  them  were  dying  in  the  hands  of  the
authorities. Today, we can talk about the  programmes  that  deal  with  the
issue of crime.

There are periodic  reports  as  to  where  we  are  in  the  country.  Yes,
something has happened. We have something to  celebrate.  We  did  not  even
have the right to talk about these things and if you did, you  would  go  to
prison. Today, all of us can talk about it, either  in  indicating  progress
or indicating not seeing the progress. It would be a sad day  if  there  are
South  Africans  who  might  feel  that  there  is  nothing  to   celebrate.
Certainly, they would be living in another country,  not  South  Africa,  if
they have not noticed the change that has come about since 1994.

When the public representatives crafted the Constitution in this very  city,
they all agreed and thought it was important to put  a  provision  regarding
the floor-crossing possibility and  said,  ``When  the  time  comes,  a  law
should be piloted to deal with this issue.'' It was an  agreement  that  was
taken by public representatives. All of them who are still represented  here
in this Parliament were part of that process.

In one imbizo I took time to explain this because, at  some  point,  it  has
been alleged that it is the governing party or other  parties  that  brought
this particular law because they wanted to  finish  other  parties.  I  took
time to explain that. I would like, just briefly, to indicate what  I  said.
As the Leader of Government Business, I was approached by the leader of  the
DP, after it had come together with  the  NP,  who  said,  ``There  is  this
provision in the Constitution.'' He also  had  a  written  submission  as  a
proposal of what the kind of Bill would look like that must help  deal  with
this issue. I must say that I was very reluctant  to  move  quickly.  I  did
say, ``This particular proposal you are making is a serious one  because  if
we move on it, some parties are too small and they might cease  to  exist.''
I said, ``However, because of its fundamental nature, I will  take  time  to
consult with other parties.'' And I  proceeded  to  do  so  under  pressure,
because he kept on asking: ``Where are you on this matter?''

At a certain stage we had to  move  forward  on  this  matter.  Indeed,  the
window of opportunity was created after a lot of consideration.  Indeed,  as
a democratic country, if we respect the  principles  of  democracy  we  have
absolutely no right to force our members to remain within our  parties  when
they don't want to do so. It's undemocratic to  complain  that  people  make
political choices. It is their democratic right.  Once  you  complain  about
it, you actually indicate signs  of  undemocraticness  in  you.  After  all,
people go to those parties that they believe have  programmes  and  policies
with which they agree.

So,  I  don't  know  why  we  should  complain  about  that.  We  should  be
celebrating this because, at last, we are able to move to wherever  we  want
to make our free choices. It,  absolutely,  requires  celebration.  I  don't
know why we should complain about that. People love  complaining  about  it,
and I don't know why.

Asikwazi ukufuya abantu njengezinkomo esibayeni kuphinde  kuthi  uma  inkomo
ilahlekile sithi siyoyifuna.  Hhayi  bo!  Ngabantu  laba  futhi  banelungelo
lokuzikhethela into abayithandayo. Bayeshelwa abantu,  njengentombi,  baqome
uma  bethanda.  [Uhleko.]  Ababanjwa  ngenkani.  (Translation   of   isiZulu
paragraph follows.)
[We cannot rear people like cattle in the kraal and go  and  look  for  them
when they have not returned home. Hey, these are people. They also have  the
right to choose whatever they like. People are persuaded  like  maidens  and
they give their consent if they want to. [Applause.] They cannot  be  forced
to do what they do not like to do.]

We have a lot to celebrate. I have always  deeply  appreciated  this  House.
The NCOP is one of the glaring  examples  of  this  country  regarding  what
democracy is all about and  of  what  participating  in  government  is  all
about.  It  is  a  meeting  point  of  different  levels  of  our  governing
institutions and political  parties.  There  is  no  other  centre  in  this
country that looks like the NCOP. It is here where  you  hear  the  accounts
being  made  by  representatives  from  national,   provincial   and   local
governments. They give their own experiences, as the hon members  here  have
done today - not through reading the columns for the highly educated in  the
print or electronic media regarding what  the  people  think  and  what  the
people want, but through the representatives who come from the people.
As I listened, I remembered one recent meeting  where  somebody  said  -  an
ordinary citizen of this country - in expressing the progress that has  been
made:

Uma indlu yakho inezibi, ungashaneli, akekho umuntu  obonayo  ukuthi  kusuke
kukhona izibi kuleyo ndlu; kuyathula nje kube sengathi  akukho  lutho.  Lezo
zibi zingaze zibe ziningi kuze kuzalele inyoka ube  ungayiboni.  Kodwa,  uma
uzishanela izibi kuye kushunqe uthuli ngoba usuke  usuyenza  ihlanzeke  leyo
ndlu  phela,   bese   kubonakala   ukuthi   kukhona   okwenzekayo   laphaya.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[If your house is dirty and you do not sweep the floor no one can  see  that
the house is dirty, it would look as if everything is in  order.  That  dirt
can increase until a snake gets in there and gives  birth  to  its  children
without anyone noticing. But if one sweeps out the dirt and  the  dust,  one
is cleaning one's house, and people start to notice that something is  going
on there.]

This ordinary citizen said, ``The reason that people, today, can talk  about
crime is because crime is being fought and being reported.''  In  the  past,
it was not fought and there were no reports about it. It looked like it  was
just quiet and there was  no  crime.  It  was  deep  but  nobody  was  doing
anything about it. That was a very  fundamental  thought  from  an  ordinary
person.

When the Premier of the Northern Cape  talked  about  the  achievements,  as
seen from the side of the Khoi people, what else could  you  say  we  cannot
celebrate? As we all know, this population was  forgotten,  almost  made  to
disappear and shy to say, ``This is  what  I  am.''  Freedom  and  democracy
came. They are proud; they talk and their culture  is  coming  back.  It  is
something to celebrate. That, alone, is like a road sign and a  landmark  to
say, South Africa and every citizen of this country are  free.  Freedom  has
brought confidence and dignity to all of us.

In the past, you could not  find  people  -  as  the  leaders  did  today  -
speaking  either  in  Sotho,  Xhosa  or  any  other  language,  because   an
impression had been created that those were not languages at all. They  were
languages that belonged to citizens that were  not  complete  citizens.  But
today:

Ungaphulaphula  xa  ithetha   inkulumbuso   yaseMpuma   Koloni,   intsokotha
ngesiXhosa, uqonde okokuba kwakhu! Ithethile  mfondini.  [Listening  to  the
Premier of the Eastern  Cape  speaking,  delving  deep  into  isiXhosa,  you
cannot help but feel: Man, what a speech!]

We therefore have something to celebrate. We are the  only  country  that  I
have come across that is not shy to talk about its past passionately, for  a
good reason, in an effort to reconcile, unite and build a  vibrant  country.
We are the only country like that.  If  you  walked  around  the  world,  in
developed and developing  countries,  we  are  quoted  as  an  example  that
everybody must look up to. That is part of the reason  there  is  confidence
on the continent that  South  Africa  must  participate  in  every  conflict
situation because South Africa has no agenda  on  these  matters.  The  only
agenda is to see peace and stability on the continent. Our voice  is  heard,
as you know, throughout the world. There  is  no  major  conference  in  the
world that takes place without South Africa being invited to take part.

Recently, I was in a conference in Jordan, in the Middle East. We  were  the
only African country to be there to participate in discussing  the  problems
of that region. And, indeed, everybody wanted  to  hear  the  South  African
experience. We have something to celebrate. We must  celebrate.  Even  those
who have different views must celebrate  the  fact  that  they  can  express
their views freely and happily, and you laugh about it. It  is,  indeed,  an
achievement.

If I said more, I would indeed be clouding the good inputs  that  have  been
made in this House. All I want to say  is:  Thank  you  very  much  for  the
opportunity. I would like to thank colleagues for their contributions  which
were so illuminating and also gave an account of where  we  are.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! We thank the hon  Deputy  President  for
having led this debate. I know that he has a very busy schedule today.

Debate concluded.

Council adjourned at 12:18.
