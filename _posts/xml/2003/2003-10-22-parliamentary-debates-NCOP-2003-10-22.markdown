                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms E C GOUWS: Thank you, Chairperson. I hereby give notice:


  That this House -


  (1) notes that the Cabinet is today finally due to discuss  the  proposed
       national   antiretroviral   treatment   plan   drawn   up    by    an
       interdepartmental task team;


  (2) notes that the operational  plan  has  apparently  been  expanded  to
       include at least one service point in each of the country's 56 health
       districts;


  (3) notes that researchers reported  this  week  that  the  pandemic  has
       already reached its peak in South Africa, which means it  is  already
       having its maximum possible effect on the people of this country;


  (4) notes that the Government has still  not  entered  into  negotiations
       with pharmaceutical companies or issued compulsory licences  for  the
       production of generic antiretrovirals.

Therefore resolves to urge the Cabinet to  accept  the  expanded  plan,  and
calls on the Minister of Health to explain how this expanded  plan  will  be
funded; what she is doing  to  secure  cheaper  drugs  for  treating  people
living with Aids and how she plans to inform ordinary South  Africans  about
the new treatment plan.

I thank you.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that due to the catastrophic  policies  followed  by  President
       Mugabe and the Zanu PF government  of  Zimbabwe,  a  once  prosperous
       state has been reduced to privation, poverty and starvation;


  (2) notes further that millions of Zimbabweans, fleeing from  that  rogue
       government for economic and political reasons, are now found all over
       neighbouring countries in Southern Africa and are scattered all  over
       the world;


  (3) calls upon the South African Government to use its influence  to  end
       this nightmare, and to work for the earliest possible full and  fair,
       properly adjudicated elections, to return an administration that  can
       start the long, hard task of rebuilding that country.  Further,  that
       this be  accompanied  by  the  exiting  of  Mr  Robert  Mugabe  whose
       government has become an obscenity;


  (4) calls upon the Government to stop hiding behind the chimera of  quiet
       diplomacy, which has become understood as  tacit  acceptance  of  the
       excesses of the Zimbabwean government.

                        MEDIA FREEDOM IN SOUTH AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson.  I  wish  to  move  without
notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  in a recent report by the  international  media  activist  group
           Reporters without Borders, South Africa is regarded  as  one  of
           the leading countries in terms of media freedom; and


       (b)  the report puts South Africa ahead of  many  European  countries
           including Britain, France, Spain and  Italy  when  it  comes  to
           media freedom; and


  (2) believes this achievement is  testimony  to  the  commitment  of  the
       Government to uphold and promote the protection  of  all  fundamental
       human rights.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chair, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride the honour bestowed by the  United  Nations  on  the
       former Minister of Housing, Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele,  for  improving
       the housing conditions of six million poor South Africans;


  (2) further notes that she was honoured for -


       (a)  the delivery within a period of eight years during her  term  of
           office of 1,45 million houses worth R20 billion,  in  which  six
           million people were housed;


       (b)  the transfer of  400  000  former  municipal  houses  worth  R32
           billion for ownership by people who had been renting them; and


       (c)  her role in the initiation  and  implementation  of  the  Rental
           Housing and Urban Renewal Programmes as well as her role as  the
           Chairperson of the First  World  Urban  Forum,  a  component  of
           United Nations Habitat; and


  (3) expresses the hope that this achievement will spur us on  to  achieve
       even greater heights in improving the quality of life  of  all  South
       Africans.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               HIGH RATE OF FAKE MARRIAGES INVOLVING SA WOMEN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with serious concern the high rate of  fake  or  scam  marriages
           that is rife amongst African women, who find themselves  married
           to persons whom they have never met before or in marriages  that
           have been solemnised in their absence;


       (b)  with dismay that some officials  from  the  Department  of  Home
           Affairs are conniving with these syndicates;


       (c)  that these syndicates are aware that many  of  these  women  are
           desperate to get employment; and


       (d)  that it is clear that these syndicates are using these abhorrent
           methods to obtain permanent citizenship or  residency  in  South
           Africa;


  (2) resolves that -


       (a)  because these fake or scam marriages have a  devastating  impact
           on our South African women, these activities  should  stop  with
           immediate effect;


       (b)  the Department of Home Affairs should urgently  investigate  all
           the outstanding cases relating to these fake marriages; and


       (c)  the Minister of Home Affairs should act swiftly  and  decisively
           against those officials who have been found to be part  of  this
           scam; and


  (3) urges all women to be vigilant at all times  and  not  to  part  with
       their identity documents under the pretext from strangers  that  they
       will be provided with jobs.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:

               SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN PEOPLE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met Die  Burger  van  vandag,  22  Oktober  2003,  saamstem  dat  die
       aanskaffing van die 30 000 nuwe  voertuie  deur  die  Suid-Afrikaanse
       Polisiediens toon dat die beskerming van al  ons  mense  ook  in  die
       praktyk die regering se erns is;


  (2) kennis neem dat hierdie stap weer eens die verfoeilike, gevaarlike en
       bedrieglike wanvoorstellings illustreer van daardie politieke  partye
       wat probeer voorgee dat die veiligheid en sekuriteit van al ons mense
       nie die regering se erns is nie, om daardeur die natuurlike vrese van
       ons mense te probeer uitbuit vir eng politieke gewin;


  (3) 'n beroep op alle wetsgehoorsame mense doen om die  Regering  en  die
       Suid-Afrikaanse Polisiediens te help in die stryd  teen  misdaad,  in
       plaas daarvan om net op die kantlyn te staan  en  skree  soos  sekere
       politieke partye.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)
[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  agrees  with  Die  Burger  of  today,  22  October  2003,  that  the
       procurement of the 30 000 new vehicles by the  South  African  Police
       Service shows that the protection of all our  people  is  taken  very
       seriously by the Government in practice as well;


  (2) notes that this step once again illustrates the detestable, dangerous
       and deceitful misrepresentations by those political parties that  are
       trying to make believe that the safety and security of all our people
       is not taken seriously by the Government, thereby trying  to  exploit
       the natural fears of our people for narrow-minded political gain;


  (3) appeals to all law-abiding citizens to assist the Government and  the
       South African Police Service in the struggle against  crime,  instead
       of just standing  and  shouting  on  the  sideline      like  certain
       political parties.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Is  there  any
objection to the motion? [Interjections.] Order! In light of the  objection,
the motion may not be proceeded with. The motion  without  notice  will  now
become a notice of motion.

Hon members, I would like to draw your attention to  a  typographical  error
on the Order Paper. The first Order of the day should read:  B  23B  and  (B
23C), instead of B 23D, as appears on the Order Paper.

                                 LIQUOR BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  Liquor
Bill that is being tabled today has been long  in  the  making  and  is  the
product of co-operation between the different tiers of government. There  is
general agreement that we need a new regulatory dispensation for the  liquor
industry.

When  this  reform  was  first  attempted  the  arrangement  of  powers  and
responsibilities between the three spheres of  government  was  tested.  The
wait has been  long  and  the  consultations  with  the  provinces,  various
components  of  the  industry  and  social  groups  have  been  intense  and
sometimes circuitous. However, the  final  product  is  a  better  piece  of
legislation for all.

As you will recall, a Liquor Bill was previously introduced into and  passed
by Parliament in 1998. That Bill introduced the concept of  registration  of
manufacturers, micromanufacturers, distributors and retailers  -  in  common
parlance, the three-tier system. This meant that the Bill also  impacted  on
powers of provinces and local government. It  raised  issues  of  concurrent
and exclusive powers and the matter of co-operative  governance.  To  obtain
clarity the Bill was referred by the President to the  Constitutional  Court
before its promulgation. The Constitutional Court  judgment  necessitated  a
review of  certain  aspects  of  the  Bill,  in  particular  the  respective
jurisdictions of national and provincial government.

After the Constitutional Court  judgment  was  handed  down,  a  process  of
redrafting  the  Liquor  Bill  was  initiated  which   culminated   in   the
introduction of a new Liquor Bill in Parliament  in  May  2003.  During  the
process of redrafting the Bill there was  extensive  consultation  with  our
provincial counterparts. This co-operative approach will extend  beyond  the
drafting and passage of this Bill to its implementation and the  passage  of
provincial liquor legislation. The  real  challenge  ahead  relates  to  the
implementation of the new system of liquor regulation  in  the  country.  It
will require even closer  co-operation  between  the  different  spheres  of
government.

The Liquor Bill that I am now introducing reflects a significant  degree  of
agreement with industry and provincial government,  addresses  a  number  of
constitutional and technical matters that were raised previously, and  meets
with Government's original intentions  in  a  workable  manner.  It  is  not
possible or desirable in such a process to  satisfy  every  demand  that  is
made. What is important is that the integrity of  the  policy  framework  is
maintained and that the legislative provisions are pragmatic and workable.

I will not repeat the original liquor  policy  document  that  set  out  the
somewhat  pernicious  history  of  the  liquor  industry  in  South  Africa.
However, we  must  not  forget  the  reality  that  the  history  of  liquor
regulation in South Africa was an integral part of segregation.  Legislation
prevented black persons from legally entering  the  economic  dimensions  of
the industry and thus visited major social consequences on them. Liquor  was
used in the notorious dop system as a means of payment, again with  profound
social  consequences.  The  result  was  a  dualism  of   massive   economic
concentration and size on the one  hand,  and  an  equally  massive  illegal
industry that was very socially vulnerable on the other. This is the  legacy
that we must collectively now address through a  new  scheme  of  regulation
for the liquor industry.
The Liquor Bill, 2003, seeks to give effect to the objectives  of  the  1997
liquor  policy  and  the  requirements  of  the  Constitution.  It  contains
measures to prevent, as far as possible, the socioeconomic costs of  alcohol
abuse. It contains mechanisms to assess industry structure and provides  for
remedial actions where there are problems. It further  creates  institutions
to give effect to co-operative governance.

The Liquor Bill seeks to address the socioeconomic costs  of  alcohol  abuse
through a number of means. In particular, chapter  2  of  the  Bill  imposes
restrictions on the supply of liquor to minors; the advertising  of  liquor,
particularly  advertising  targeting  minors;  the  use  of  liquor  as   an
inducement for employment, thus outlawing the dop  system;  the  manufacture
and supply of methylated spirits; and the prohibition on concoctions.

In addition, Chapter 3 of the Bill requires manufacturers  and  distributors
to submit  a  plan  to  combat  the  abuse  of  alcohol  as  part  of  their
registration requirements. As I mentioned earlier,  the  Bill  introduces  a
flexible three-tier system which requires the  registration  and  regulation
of the manufacture and distribution  through  national  Government  and  the
micromanufacture and retail of liquor  through  provincial  government.  The
Bill  further  allows  the  Minister  to  delegate  powers   to   provincial
governments for  the  registration  of  provincial  distributors.  The  Bill
therefore  explicitly  recognises  that  provincial   activity   should   be
regulated at provincial and local levels in a  manner  consistent  with  the
Constitution.

In  the  scheme  of  regulation  for  distributors  and  manufacturers,  the
Minister of Trade and Industry must evaluate the  application  in  terms  of
three main criteria: the commitment to black  economic  empowerment  by  the
applicant; the commitment to combating the abuse of alcohol; the  impact  of
the registration on new entries into the  industry;  and  the  diversity  of
ownership and competition in the industry balanced  against  the  impact  of
employment, efficiency and exports. Based on  the  evaluation  the  Minister
may impose conditions on the registration.

The  Bill  further  allows  the  Minister  to  review  the   conditions   of
registration  if  the  registrant  becomes  registered  as  a  retailer   or
micromanufacturer in terms  of  provincial  legislation,  or  has  in  other
respects materially altered its operations;  contravenes  certain  laws;  or
fails to meet the conditions of its registration.

In chapter 6 of the Bill we give expression to  co-operative  governance  by
creating  the  National  Liquor  Policy   Council.   The   council   is   an
intergovernmental forum headed  by  the  Minister  and  constituted  by  the
Member of the Executive Council responsible for  liquor  licensing  in  each
province. The council's functions are: firstly, to  develop  national  norms
and standards for the liquor industry; secondly, to develop national  policy
in  respect   of   the   liquor   industry;   and,   thirdly,   to   promote
intergovernmental relations in respect of this industry.

The Liquor Bill, 2003, thus gives expression to the objectives of  the  1997
liquor policy by providing mechanisms to intervene in the structure  of  the
industry where necessary, to create conditions facilitating  new  entry  and
black economic empowerment, to  combat  the  socioeconomic  consequences  of
alcohol  abuse  through  certain  public-interest  prohibitions,   and   the
development of a sustainable and responsible liquor industry. It  does  this
in a manner consistent with the Constitution by  recognising  the  exclusive
jurisdiction of provincial government and by setting out mechanisms for  co-
operation between the different tiers of government.

I would like to express my thanks to the Select Committee  on  Economic  and
Foreign Affairs for supporting us in this endeavour and for  helping  us  to
steer this difficult  piece  of  legislation  to  this  point.  I  thank  my
provincial colleagues and their  officials  for  all  their  hard  work.  My
thanks go to the DTI team for their hard work. There is, of course, more  to
come as we set up the institutional capacity to implement  the  new  Act.  I
should also say a special thanks to many in  the  industry  and  to  various
social groups that went out of their way to  ensure  that  we  addressed  an
economic need and reality, whilst ensuring social responsibility. I  commend
this Bill to the House. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO:  Hon  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Minister,  the  Deputy  Minister  in
absentia, hon members, Parliament  has  been  seized  with  the  problem  of
legislating for the liquor industry for some time now.  We  are  happy  that
this seems to be coming to some finality.

In 1998 Parliament passed a Bill after a long process of consultation.  When
that Bill was  referred  to  the  President  for  consent,  he  doubted  its
constitutionality in relation to  certain  provisions.  The  President  then
referred the  Bill  to  the  Constitutional  Court,  which  ruled  that  the
national Government had powers  to  regulate  the  liquor  industry  in  the
spheres  of  manufacturing  and   distribution,   while   the   retail   and
micromanufacturing spheres remained a competency of provincial governments.

The Bill before us is an attempt by the Department of Trade and Industry  to
address the areas that were queried by the Constitutional  Court,  with  the
aim of bringing the entire liquor industry in line with our Constitution.

I think we all agree that liquor is a potentially  dangerous  substance  and
therefore that its manufacture,  distribution  and  retail  cannot  be  left
entirely to market forces. I am sure that every one of us  has  a  story  to
tell regarding the socioeconomic effects and overconsumption  of  liquor  in
our country. Given the above, a responsible Government like ours  cannot  be
a spectator in a situation in which there is a free proliferation of  liquor
to the detriment of the social welfare of our communities. It  is  for  this
reason that Government, through this Bill,  seeks  to  regulate  the  liquor
industry. This is done by setting  essential  norms  and  standards  in  the
liquor industry; by regulating the manufacture and distribution  of  liquor;
and by regulating the retail and micromanufacturing of liquor.

In essence, the Bill puts in place a  very  clear  but  flexible  three-tier
system in the liquor industry that is flexible in the sense that one  person
can apply and be licensed to operate in more than one tier of the  industry,
but such a person will have to fulfil higher requirements.  These  are,  for
instance, how he or she envisages combating alcohol abuse and how he or  she
hopes to promote black economic empowerment, to state but a few.

We  have  no  doubt  in  our  minds  that  this  system  will  allow  proper
restructuring of the industry and effective regulation. The  main  tool  for
regulation, in this regard, is the registration of anyone who gets  licensed
in any of the three tiers of operation, namely, manufacturing,  distribution
and retail or even a combination of any of these,  and  the  prosecution  of
all those who operate unregistered or unlicensed.

Today the beer industry is a monopoly in South  Africa.  Theoretically,  the
market can allow other role-players to come  into  the  beer  industry  but,
practically, the industry is such that it rejects  new  entrants.  Mahanyele
and others' Vivo is  a  classical  example.  Vivo  tried  to  penetrate  the
market, but could not compete against the giant SA Breweries.

The Bill before us is another attempt to level the  playing  field  so  that
new entrants can come into the liquor industry.  It  will  allow  those  who
have hitherto not been allowed  directly  or  indirectly  to  get  into  the
industry to do so. This is a genuine attempt by the Department of Trade  and
Industry to break the liquor monopoly, specifically  the  beer  monopoly  in
the country, so that new entrants can  also  contribute  to  creating  much-
needed jobs.

One of the biggest problems we  are  faced  with  in  this  country  is  the
consumption of liquor by minors. If this is left unchecked it will  lead  to
an untenable situation in which we will have a  nation  of  drunkards.  This
will then inevitably lead to low levels  of  productivity  in  the  economy,
which is something undesirable. To avoid this type of  situation,  the  Bill
is unequivocal in prohibiting the supply of liquor or methylated spirits  to
minors. With this being the general principle, we also recognise that  there
are  certain  rituals,  like  the  Holy  Communion  in   certain   religious
institutions in which wine is offered under the  supervision  of  a  priest.
The committee  has  had  to  bring  in  a  small  amendment  to  remove  any
uncertainty, and not to criminalise  innocent  people  with  regard  to  the
above.

You will agree with me that in almost every  township  or  settlement  there
are shebeens that sell unhygienic concoctions with impunity to  our  people.
Their concoctions have orphaned thousands of children and  widowed  hundreds
of women. Once again, a responsible government cannot sit on  the  sidelines
when people die due to  these  concoctions.  This  Bill  is  unambiguous  in
outlawing these concoctions. We hope the provinces will  act  decisively  in
closing down such shebeens and locking up the shebeen kings and  queens  who
supply our people with this poison.

The notorious tot or dop system, to which the Minister has already  referred
and which was  practised  or  is  still  practised  in  the  vine  and  wine
industry, is well documented and known to most of us.  It  is  a  system  in
which wine is used as an incentive to encourage people to work faster.  This
system is applied in different ways, but the crudest of them all is  when  a
farmer first makes the people alcoholics  and  thereafter  starves  them  of
alcohol for a day. On the day when they are supposed to go to  work,  a  tot
of alcohol is put at the end of the row. A person starts  at  the  beginning
of the row and works very fast to be able to reach the  tot  because  he  or
she is very thirsty. That is the problem. [Interjections.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, these are terrible accusations, and  I  would  like
to ask whether such accusations could be brought up officially so that  they
can be acted upon. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  member,
you know  the  procedure  that  in  terms  of  the  Rules,  when  there  are
accusations, members are allowed to put a substantive motion for  debate  in
the House. The Rules are very clear on that. Continue, hon member.

Mr B J TOLO: Thank you, hon Chair. This Bill puts an end to this  and  other
barbaric ways of using alcohol as an incentive  to  work  even  harder.  The
Bill seeks to restore dignity among people who work in the wine industry.

To date, it has been the function of the police to enforce  compliance  with
liquor laws. This new Bill gives the Minister the  power  to  designate  any
person as an inspector and requires such  a  person  to  be  issued  with  a
certificate. These inspectors will be the ones who will  monitor  compliance
with the law in the industry. Their powers and functions are clearly  stated
in the Bill. We want to commend the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  for
this, as it is our firm belief that we  need  dedicated  personnel  to  deal
with this function as its  importance  cannot  be  overemphasised.  We  also
believe the police's hands are  full,  but,  yes,  from  time  to  time  the
inspectors can solicit their help.

The Bill further provides for the establishment of a national liquor  policy
council. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, Chairperson.  I  must  at  the
commencement say, from the point of view of  KwaZulu-Natal,  that  the  Bill
before us represents a most significant improvement on the original Bill  of
1998. Without going  into  any  details,  the  most  important  is  that  it
significantly takes on board the Constitutional  Court's  ruling  pertaining
to powers of provinces regarding retail licensing.

Having said this, this Bill poses a number of challenges for provinces,  the
first of which is timing. The fact that we are dealing with and  are  likely
to pass this Bill late into this term of office  creates  a  problem.  While
KwaZulu-Natal has drafted a provincial liquor  Bill,  time  constraints  for
the legislature will prevent us from passing it before the  2004  elections.
It will then become the responsibility of the next legislature to deal  with
it.
This also means, with regard to the national  Bill  -  if  promulgated  this
year - that retail will still be subject to the repealed  1989  Liquor  Act,
in terms of schedule 1 of the transitional provisions of  this  Bill,  until
provincial legislation is in place.

Secondly,  the  biggest  challenge  for  provinces  may  well  be  how  they
legislate and control the micromanufacture, distribution  and  retailing  of
liquor. Of significance  in  this  respect  will  be  the  threshold  volume
determined by the  Minister  in  regulations  as  contemplated  in  sections
5(10)(a) and (b) of this Bill.  The  size  of  the  micro  segment  of  this
industry has not been quantified but it is a widespread practice.

No matter what legislation provinces put in place, the temptation  will  be,
by and large,  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to  this  practice  because  of  the
difficulties that will be encountered in law enforcement. The  sad  part  is
that, at this level, alcohol abuse is often very prevalent.

This brings me to the issue of alcohol abuse. We are pleased that  the  Bill
terminates the malpractice of the ``dop'' system as a reward for labour.  We
welcome this prohibition. But, with regard to all  other  forms  of  alcohol
abuse such as drinking in public and drunk and disorderly  behaviour,  which
is and becomes a provincial responsibility, the provincial legislation  will
have to provide for the authority for police to deal with such situations.

Furthermore, I wish to raise the issue of the  negative  social  effects  of
alcohol abuse  which  is  partly  but  not  effectively  addressed  in  this
legislation; it should be. Yet, in gaming and betting  legislation,  we  are
going to almost absurd lengths to deal with the negative social  effects  of
problem gaming. Both need to be addressed in a more effective and  practical
manner.

Furthermore,  on  the  issue  of  norms  and  standards,  KwaZulu-Natal   is
supportive of the work done by the provincial task team which is engaged  in
developing  guidelines  for  provincial   legislation.   We   caution   that
disparities in provincial legislation could create a range of problems.  One
of these could be the enforcement by police  who  are  deployed  nationally.
Should their mandates  differ  from  province  to  province,  confusion  may
reign. Another confusion  may  be  that  the  general  population  may  move
between provinces.

Finally, the manufacture, distribution and  retail  of  methylated  spirits,
which in terms of this Bill becomes a totally national function,  and  which
could  be  questionable  with  regards  to  constitutionality,  raises   the
concerns of who will be responsible for the monitoring of the retail  aspect
of methylated spirits. Presumably it will be the national inspectorate.

In conclusion, KwaZulu-Natal will be supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr O SINGH (KwaZulu-Natal): Assalaamu alaikum! [Peace be upon  you!]  Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP, it is indeed a pleasure and  privilege  for  me  to
speak on this important Bill, the Liquor Bill of 2003. The Bill's  objective
is to reduce the socioeconomic effects and the cost of alcohol  consumption.
This Bill will be setting essential national  norms  and  standards  in  the
liquor industry. As my colleague has  just  informed  this  House,  KwaZulu-
Natal is in the process of discussing the draft Bill.

The  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  and  the  provincial  departments
responsible for liquor matters jointly embarked on this  extensive  exercise
to  evaluate  the  existing  legislation  regulating  the  manufacture   and
distribution of the sale of liquor for consumption in 1994.  This  important
factor is regulating the manufacturing and wholesale distribution of  liquor
which is, in my opinion, one of the most important objectives  so  that  the
standards and qualities are observed at all times.

This Bill provides the entry of new participants into  the  liquor  industry
with  diversity   of   ownership   and,   most   importantly,   the   social
responsibility of the industry so that, as the  chairperson  has  said,  one
company or entity does not  control  this  industry.  This  Bill  will  also
provide the Department of Trade and  Industry  with  the  responsibility  of
licensing and inspection of national manufacturing and  wholesale  licences.
Inspection is very important. This Bill specifies  that  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry should  have  sufficient  capacity  to  deal  with  these
functions.

These functions have financial implications  in  terms  of  providing  extra
staff for the licensing and inspection functions of  this  Bill.  Funds  are
available for the licensing and monitoring function  of  this  Bill.  A  new
Deputy Director and two assistants will start this process.

It is important that provincial workshops  were  held  regarding  this  Bill
with the industry and relevant stakeholders and the media that was  affected
were brought on board so that this industry is not in any way  taken  for  a
ride.

I am pleased that this  Bill  has  gone  through  the  proper  parliamentary
procedures and the timeframes set out in  section  76  of  the  Constitution
since it involves  the  intervention  in  terms  of  section  44(2)  of  the
Constitution of South Africa. This  Bill  introduces  a  new  element  where
there is an establishment of the National Liquor Council which involves  the
Minister of Trade and Industry and the  relevant  members  in  an  executive
council. This is one of the very important parts of the Bill. This  body  is
responsible for the  proper  policing,  formulation  and  co-ordination  and
gives expression to the concept of co-operative governance.

This Bill brings  sobriety  to  the  liquor  industry  where  the  Bill  has
levelled the playing fields so that all relevant role-players have an  equal
chance in the industry. We from KwaZulu-Natal support this Bill.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, Minister, the Western Cape supports  the  intention
of the Bill as well as most of the provisions of the Bill. It has,  however,
serious reservations about two clauses.

Clause 4 imposes a three-tier  system  of  manufacturers,  distributors  and
retailers  on  the  liquor  industry.  Following   the   judgment   by   the
Constitutional Court, the Bill  provides  that  the  Minister  regulate  the
manufacturing and distribution tiers, while the provincial legislation  will
regulate the retail and micromanufacturing tier.  With  this,  the  province
has no problem.

Clause 4(7) of the Bill prevents a holder of  a  provincial  retail  licence
from selling liquor to another retailer, effectively preventing  the  common
practice of a liquor store selling small quantities on a regular basis to  a
restaurant or guesthouse.

In Clause 4(8) the Bill does allow for the sale by  a  retailer  to  another
retailer only if the sale is bona fide as if to a  consumer  of  liquor.  It
specifically does not allow for a standing arrangement of sale and  delivery
on a regular basis for resale, such as the provision of a small quantity  of
wine to a guesthouse or restaurant.  This  is  particularly  relevant  in  a
small platteland town.

For this innocuous practice to continue,  the  holder  of  a  retail  liquor
licence must obtain a distribution licence. This means a bottle  store  will
now have to hold both a provincial liquor licence and  be  registered  as  a
distributor with the Minister  at  national  level.  Two  separate  sets  of
rules: one set nationally and one  set  provincially  will  apply  to  these
retailers.

This further means that in the Western Cape alone  the  current  755  liquor
stores will probably attempt  to  obtain  registration  as  distributors  to
enable them to continue selling liquor to other on-consumption retailers  on
a continuous basis. It is doubtful if it is the intention  of  the  Minister
to regulate the distribution of liquor at this microlevel, and the  function
is probably better regulated at the provincial level.

In an attempt to  address  this  problem,  clause  45(2)  provides  for  the
devolution to a member of the executive council  of  each  province  of  the
Minister's functions to regulate  the  distribution  tier  in  a  particular
province. This does, however, raise its own problems. The first  problem  is
that it now requires the provincial liquor authority,  be  it  a  provincial
liquor board or  MEC,  to  administer  two  Acts:  the  provincial  and  the
national Acts. Each Act creates its  own  set  of  requirements,  rules  and
offences, creating the  possibility  of  confusion  amongst  the  provincial
administrators and the enforcers of the Acts, the licence  holders  and  the
public.

The second problem is that the devolution potentially  creates  an  unfunded
mandate for  the  province.  It  now  is  possibly  required  to  administer
national legislation devolved to it without funding, in  conflict  with  the
principle of funds to follow function.

Currently, the Western Cape has developed a draft policy document  that  the
municipalities, the SA Police  Service  and  other  interested  parties  are
consulting.  It  is  expected  that  the  policy  document  and   subsequent
legislation will be passed before the start of the next  financial  year  in
March 2004.

We in the Western  Cape,  Minister,  were  disappointed  that  some  of  our
amendments were not accepted, particularly those to  clause  4,  to  resolve
the problems I've mentioned.  The  last-minute  alternative  changes,  which
represent a substantial change to the legislation, were not  able  to  serve
before the provincial select committees concerned. This is not,  and  I  say
this respectfully, an ideal way of making law.  That  is  why  we  abstained
from voting on the clause in the committee.

We are, however, grateful that  the  department  did  seek  to  address  our
concerns, even if by a different route. We were also concerned that  in  the
attempt to protect minors we  did  not  criminalise  the  use  of  religious
sacraments and the moderate use of  wine  within  a  family  situation.  Our
concerns were heard and we are grateful that the amendments we brought  were
accepted.

We have a major concern remaining, which we hope the Minister will  help  us
with today with an assurance if he can.  The  Bill  provides  for  arbitrary
discretion  to  the  Minister  to  define  micromanufacturing,   which   can
effectively    nullify    the    Constitutional    Court's    ruling    that
micromanufacturing be regulated by the provincial sphere of  government,  by
setting such low limits that wine estates in our province would  fall  under
the control of  the  national  Government.  This  can  affect  our  tourism,
leisure and hospitality industry such as the wine  routes.  We  would  value
the  Minister's  assurance  that   he   has   no   intention   of   defining
micromanufacturing so as to remove it from the provincial sphere.

Then, lastly, may I just say, Minister, that one of  the  problems  which  I
know the Minister is trying to address is that of  legalising  shebeens  and
regulating that aspect for the historical reasons he mentioned to us. It  is
very good that he  should  do  so.  The  problem,  however,  lies  at  local
authority level, not  at  provincial  level  or  central  Government  level,
because very often a licence is given  by  the  provincial  authority  to  a
shebeen, but the problem  is  that  the  local  authority  won't  allow  the
rezoning of the property so as to allow that person to  continue  with  that
enterprise on that site, even for a temporary period  of  say  two  or  five
years.

That is something you are going to have to look at, that is,  how  to  bring
also the local authorities into the spirit of what you wish  to  attempt  to
do.  This  is  because  60%  of  applications  from  shebeens  are  actually
authorised by the provincial authorities, but the  frustration  of  allowing
them to come into the mainstream of our economy - which all of  us  may  try
to do, for all of the good reasons the Minister pointed out  himself  -  is,
in fact, to bring the local authorities  on  board  so  that  the  necessary
zoning  attitudes  can  apply  to  make  this  possible.  We   support   the
legislation. I thank you.

Mr L  G  LEVER:  Chairperson,  there  are  a  number  of  issues  that  make
regulating the liquor industry a complex exercise.  Firstly,  there  is  the
diverse nature of the industry itself.  On  the  one  hand,  there  are  the
proverbial mom and pop micromanufacturers - as well as  traditional  brewers
- who perhaps bottle one label  of  wine  as  an  ancillary  business  to  a
guesthouse or restaurant on a wine route.

On the other hand, there are powerful co-operatives and even  more  powerful
multinational  companies.  Also,  the  Constitution  requires  that  certain
aspects of the industry are controlled and regulated at the  national  level
of Government, namely, manufacturing and distribution. Other  aspects,  such
as the licensing of retail outlets, are exclusive provincial competences.

The Bill has two objectives: to deal with the social  cost  aspects  of  the
liquor industry, and to deal with  the  commercial  aspects  of  the  liquor
industry. As far as  the  regulation  of  the  social-cost  aspects  of  the
industry are concerned, I am satisfied that the measures  put  in  place  by
the Bill are appropriate to deal with  the  abusive  practices  that  exist,
some of which have a very long history.

My concerns arise out of the manner in which the commercial aspects  of  the
industry are regulated in the Bill. The original version of the Bill  sought
to establish a three-tier structure  in  which  distribution  was  separated
from the control of the producers, so that their position in the market  was
not further entrenched. This would have allowed wholesalers to choose  where
to source their supplies, allowing them to break free from the tied  pricing
arrangements. The Bill gave manufactures who owned the  distribution  system
three years to disinvest. This would have  provided  many  opportunities  to
thousands of small, mostly black, retailers.

In late May this year, the Bill was withdrawn for further consultation  with
the industry. The department claimed, when the Bill was withdrawn, that  the
three-tier system,  excluding  cross-holdings,  would  remain.  The  amended
Bill,  however,  allows  for  cross-holdings  in   the   manufacturing   and
distribution sectors to the advantage of the  industry  monopolies.  Control
at the wholesale distribution level effectively keeps the  industry  in  the
same few hands.

It is for these reasons that the DA opposes this Bill.

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  and
colleagues, public hearings on the Bill being debated  today  were  held  in
May  this  year.  At  these  hearings  concerns  were   voiced   about   the
implementation of the three-tier system, about technical matters  and  about
the constitutionality and regulation of retail.

A series  of  meetings  between  the  DTI  and  some  industry  role-players
resulted in a broad  agreement,  whereafter  amendments  were  effected  and
circulated to parties that had participated in the process  to  enable  them
to make further inputs. A workshop was  held  on  17  July  to  discuss  the
proposed amendments, which led to further  changes.  These  amendments  were
finally submitted to the portfolio and select committees.

The current  Liquor  Bill  is  intended  to  regulate  the  manufacture  and
distribution of liquor, which are areas of national competence. In terms  of
the amended version, there will be separate licences for  the  manufacturing
and distribution of liquor,  but  manufacturers  will  be  allowed  to  hold
distribution licences as well. The latest version  of  the  Bill  no  longer
outlaws cross-ownership among the three sectors  of  the  industry,  namely,
manufacturing, distribution and retail.

The Minister of Trade and  Industry  will  have  the  discretion  to  impose
conditions, with the objective of promoting black economic  empowerment  and
competition, and preventing alcohol abuse. Retail licensing  is  left  as  a
provincial competence.

The new Bill also restricts advertising of liquor products in a manner  that
is false and misleading, and in a  manner  intended  to  target  or  attract
minors.
Chairperson, the Liquor Bill, 2003, was drafted with the view  to  complying
with the judgment of the Constitutional Court. Previous legislation did  not
regulate the micromanufacture or the sale of that liquor for consumption.

The Bill  also  allows  for  provincial  governments  to  legislate  certain
provisions concerning cross-holdings across the three tiers of the  industry
in chapter 4, and for the national norms and standards set out  in  schedule
1. These provisions are necessary to maintain economic unity  and  essential
national and minimum standards required for the rendering of services.

Another new element introduced in the  Bill  is  the  establishment  of  the
National Liquor Policy Council, which consists of the Minister of Trade  and
Industry and the relevant provincial MECs. This  body  will  be  responsible
for policy formulation and co-ordination, and it will give  content  to  the
concept of co-operative governance.

Chairperson, the New NP supports the Bill and its latest  and  eleventh-hour
amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Thank you, Chairperson. I want  to  start  off  by  saying
that it is unfortunate that I have to say this in  isiXhosa.  I  don't  have
enough English vocabulary to express this. It refers to whoever  is  opposed
to this. In isiXhosa there is a saying.

Abakhalazayo basazalwa nanamhla. Bangqengqe  ngemihlana.  Okwabo  kukusoloko
besithi ``ngekuthe''. [A new cynic is born every  day.  They  lie  on  their
backs. Theirs is the habit of saying ``should have''.]

As we are moving towards the  first  decade  of  freedom,  the  struggle  to
eradicate poverty and underdevelopment remain  fundamental  to  our  aim  of
achieving a caring and people-centred society. Our legislative  institutions
are mandated to deliver a quality set  of  laws  for  the  people  of  South
Africa, but it is up to  us  to  ensure  that  these  laws  are  implemented
effectively and efficiently.

We, as members of  this  Parliament,  must  ensure  that  the  centuries-old
legacy of colonialism, racism and apartheid is removed  from  the  lives  of
our people. Through this piece of legislation,  the  ANC  is  engaged  in  a
coherent plan  of  social  transformation  which  attentively  is  aimed  at
broadening the front for reconstruction and development.

The building of a truly nonracial, nonsexist, prosperous  South  Africa  and
genuine emancipation of our people depend a lot on  how  we  carry  out  our
Government's tasks. We need to, one, improve the capacity of  the  state  to
meet its obligations towards the citizens, giving  a  spurt  to  drivers  of
economic growth and job creation; two, broaden  access  to  social  services
and improve their quality; and, three, improve international solidarity  and
contribute to building a better life for all.

As duly elected representatives of the  people  of  this  country,  we  must
ensure that Parliament plays a vital role  in  protecting  people's  rights,
ensuring the visible and meaningful transfer of economic power. We must  put
in place a  mechanism  whereby  disadvantaged  participants  themselves  can
report any  hindrances  and  ensure  that  corrective  action  is  taken  to
expedite their participation in this industry. We believe that this  process
will start with the current legislation tabled here today.

I would like to mention that the primary  objectives  of  the  Bill  are  to
restructure the liquor industry and to address  the  socioeconomic  cost  of
alcohol abuse. It is important to  note  that  in  the  past  the  apartheid
government used liquor and liquor legislation to  control  and  exploit  the
masses. Today this Bill no longer outlaws cross-ownership  among  the  three
sectors of the industry, namely, manufacturing, distribution and retail.

The  Trade  and  Industry  Minister  will  have  the  discretion  to  impose
conditions, with  the  aim  of  promoting  black  economic  empowerment  and
competition, and preventing alcohol abuse. Retail licensing  has  been  left
to the provincial legislatures. The new Bill also restricts the  advertising
of liquor products in a manner that  is  false  and  misleading,  and  in  a
manner intended to target or attract minors.

We want to commend the DTI for prohibiting the sale  of  alcohol  to  anyone
below the age  of  eighteen  years.  This  amendment  is  intended  for  the
protection of children, specifically in the wine  industry,  and  to  reduce
the risk of exposing the young. This in itself is a bold  step  that  is  in
line with other national pieces  of  legislation  which  includes  penalties
against signatories who breach agreements, etc.

In addition, we  also  want  to  commend  the  department  for  banning  any
unpotable  substances,  that  is  substances  that  are  unsafe  for   human
consumption. In this regard, I want to mention the fact that in the  not-so-
distant past battery acid was mixed  with  our  famous  umqombothi  [African
beer], and this in itself gave our  traditional  beer  a  bad  name  in  the
industry.

It is without doubt that the amendments  to  the  Liquor  Bill  tabled  here
today aim to, one, establish national norms  and  standards;  two,  maintain
economic unity within the liquor  industry;  three,  provide  for  essential
national and minimum standards required  for  rendering  of  services;  and,
four, provide for measures to promote co-operative governance  in  the  area
of liquor regulations and matters connected therewith.

This is in line with the repeated statements of national  Government,  which
stress that it is not the intention of the national Government to  interfere
in the exclusive competence of the provincial sphere of government.  It  has
also been indicated that it is not the intention of national  Government  to
regulate the distribution of liquor within a province.

In addition, the enforcement of the retail activities of licence holders  in
terms of provincial  legislation  will  be  a  function  of  the  provincial
enforcement agents. The responsible national department does  not  have  the
capacity, or the intention, to regulate  the  activities  of  retailers  who
sell liquor to other retailers within the confines of a province.

In conclusion, I would like to mention that the  control  of  alcohol  is  a
must, and we  are  ready  to  implement  legislation  and  decisions  around
developments in this regard. We want the people to  know  that  we  are  the
custodians of the policies that we have developed and, that,  together  with
them, we will make sure that we remain steadfast  in  our  quest  to  combat
racism and eradicate poverty and underdevelopment, whilst ensuring a  better
life  for  all.  The  ANC  supports  this  Bill.  Thank  you,   Chairperson.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chairperson,  and  thank  you
to those who support the Bill. I do  believe  it's  an  important  piece  of
legislation and a timely one, despite the fact that  we've  had  to  take  a
long time to introduce this new dispensation.

Let me comment on some of the points raised.  Firstly,  I  think,  as  we've
shown, we are going to and will work with the provinces. I think there is  a
great deal of work to be done with the provinces. This is a power that  lies
within their jurisdiction. It cannot possibly be an unfunded  mandate.  This
is something that they will  have  to  have  planned  for  and  should  have
planned for and we will work together to try and ensure  that  we  implement
the Bill, because we now do have a tremendous  challenge  of  ensuring  that
previously illegal and unlicensed shebeens are brought into the system in  a
correct way.

The task team, I believe, has been working very well,  and  the  big  change
between the present dispensation and the previous one is  that  we  are  now
working towards more standard  formats  because,  as  the  hon  member  from
KwaZulu-Natal, Mr Aulsebrook, said, it would be very problematic if  we  had
widely divergent standards in the provinces, otherwise we are going to  have
a lot of difficulties, and at the borders we are also  going  to  have  many
difficulties that will take place. So, I  believe  the  spirit  between  the
provinces now is good, and it is an excellent situation that we face.

In regard to methylated spirits, obviously it should  not  be  sold  in  any
form as a liquor and, therefore, we  are  controlling  its  manufacture  and
distribution for the purposes that it's designed for, not as a liquor.  That
responsibility will fall, in the main, on the  national  Government,  but  I
would have thought that it would also be for the provincial  regulators  and
authorities. If they come across people selling this as a liquor,  it  falls
within their responsibility to act. So I  think  we  can  work  together  on
that.

I would submit, hon Durr, that in the Western Cape, in  large  measure,  you
have misunderstood what we have tried to achieve with  regard  to  retailers
selling to small guesthouses, for example. Now,  the  problem  that  we  are
addressing here is that we must prevent these gigantic retail shops,  and  I
don't have to mention the names, that are selling  in  gigantic  quantities,
and are acting  as  retailers  when,  in  fact,  they  are  wholesalers  and
sometimes even manufacturers.

On the other hand, we are quite cognisant of the fact that  someone  from  a
small guesthouse may walk into a bottle store and buy some bottles  for  the
night. Section 4.7 is designed to deal with that. So, it's  not  an  attempt
to restrict that, but an attempt to provide for that, and it has to then  be
measured against the conditions under which a retailer  selling  to  another
registered person or acting as a wholesaler must be restricted. Now, it's  a
difficult balance, but we have attempted to  meet  that  need  and  we  will
assess it over time. I think the Act very consciously  tries  to  deal  with
that.

With regard to the so-called shebeens and the  local  governments  in  which
they are  placed,  this  is  a  local  government  responsibility.  We  have
deliberately made it a local government  responsibility  because  they  will
have to deal with the local communities and the planning  issues  that  were
raised. So the responsibilities for the location and siting of retailers  of
alcohol is  a  local  government  issue.  I  think  that's  important.  Some
provinces are working with the local governments to try and get  uniformity,
but this is something that, I think, rightly remains with local government.

Let me deal with the issue of cross-ownership and  much  of  the  discussion
and debate as to whether we have or have not backed  down  in  the  face  of
monopolies, etc. As I indicated in my opening  remarks,  our  intention  was
clear at the beginning. We were going to have three tiers, and the  linkages
between those tiers were going to be  regulated.  Now  the  industry  had  a
choice; that's competition law. They told me a few years ago that  they  did
not  want  competition  law,  and  now  they  suddenly  tell  me  they  want
competition law.

Well, the fact of the matter  is  that  we  are  putting  the  bulk  of  the
competitive matters in this Act. Acts done by a supplier of  any  type  that
are anticompetitive, that are not explicitly covered in the Act,  can  still
be dealt with by the competition law. We are going to structure these  three
tiers, but we acknowledged, in our discussion with the industry, and we  are
aware of this, that from a practical point of view, this  structure  of  our
economy is extremely complex.

So should we, or can we, practically speaking, prevent every  single  cross-
holding across the three tiers? The  answer  is  no  with  regard  to  large
groups that exist. It's not only breweries, but all sorts  of  large  groups
that exist, which have got holdings here, there and everywhere.  What  we've
agreed on is this, and frankly, I can see no other practical way of  dealing
with this other than the way we are dealing with it, and that  is  that  you
are a licensed holder, you are a registrant and we will need  to  know  what
you are doing in all these three tiers.  It's  the  only  practical  way  in
which we can achieve this. It's very clear what it is that we are trying  to
do, which is to create the three tiers, as  everyone  has  indicated,  in  a
flexible manner.

I'm quite satisfied that we are dealing with this from a pragmatic point  of
view and we all are trying to achieve  the  three  tiers.  So,  I'm  puzzled
about taking a major piece  of  legislation  and  not  supporting  it,  just
because of that one practical act. I think it's a really senseless  exercise
because, really, it also denies the commercial realities  that  we  have  in
our economy today. The attempt at severe and absolutely rigid prevention  of
any form of cross-holding is quite frankly impractical and unworkable; so  I
can't see the logic of not supporting it for that reason.

With regard to the matter of micromanufacturers, which  has  also  come  up,
again, let's look at the practical situation. There  are  wine  estates  and
there are wine estates. Some are massive, absolutely massive,  and  to  call
them micromanufacturers is absolute nonsense; they are not.  Some  are  very
small. So, we have a practical situation.
Our intention here is not to take wine estates away from the  Western  Cape.
I don't know whether they'd operate better or  worse  if  that  happened.  I
think they'd probably operate exactly the same. Our intention  here  is  not
about who is controlling these things. Our intention is to say yes, when  it
comes to micromanufacturing, an operation that exists in  a  very  localised
area and is obviously small is correctly the responsibility of the  province
to deal with that. However, the reality is that some of  these  estates,  be
they beer manufacturers, umqombothi  manufacturers  or  whatever,  are  very
big, and they  are  not  micromanufacturers.  Therefore,  they  have  to  be
regulated as ordinary manufacturers.

The reason we have left the quantities to  the  regulators  is  because  the
industry changes very fast. You only have to  go  to  KwaZulu-Natal  to  see
what has happened on the beer route. You only have to go  to  certain  parts
of this country to see how very quickly a very interesting and  diverse  set
of manufacturers are growing up to know that we must keep tabs on  this,  we
must know what's happening, and we must attempt to ensure that the  industry
is properly regulated.

I really do think that for the amount of work  that's  gone  into  this,  we
have a better Act, and  I  think  it's  necessary  that  we  should  all  be
supportive. I can't, for the life of me, see why anyone  does  not  want  to
support this Act. Obviously, the industry and  the  big  companies  may  not
have everything they want, but one thing I must just make crystal  clear  to
everybody is that we will ensure that we know exactly what is  happening  on
each tier of this industry, and any registrant, no matter how big they  are,
that attempts to break that and go into the retailing thing willy-nilly,  we
will act against. I don't care how big they are, we will act against them.

So, we are opening possibilities for other people, and we are  dealing  with
a tremendous concentration in this industry that does exist  for  historical
reasons. I really would urge all to support this  and  I'd  really  like  to
thank my provincial colleagues and the provinces for their support. We  will
work together. We must have a better dispensation for liquor  that  benefits
everybody. Thank you. [Applause.]

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND RECREATION -
     MEMBERSHIP TO THE STATUTES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR GENETIC
                        ENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

Ms N P KHUNOU: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, one  of  the  indicators  of
the degree of a country's science and technology advances is the  extent  to
which that country can actually benchmark itself against the scientific  and
technological   standards   laid   down   by   internationally    accredited
institutions. One such institution is the International Centre  for  Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology. South Africa's application for membership  to
this foremost international institution will, without doubt,  not  only  put
our scientific and biotechnological capacity on par with  the  best  in  the
world, but also under the microscope of peer review.

The  ICGEB  is  an  international  organisation  with  a  membership  of  47
countries,  which  are  dedicated  to  advanced  research  and  training  in
molecular biology with a special emphasis on the  needs  of  the  developing
world. It operates several research programmes of  high  scientific  content
in laboratories in  Trieste,  Italy;  and  New  Delhi,  India.  It  conducts
innovative research in life sciences  for  the  benefit  of  the  developing
world. It further strengthens the research capacity of its  members  through
training, fellowship and funding programmes.  The  ICGEB  provides  advisory
services on  policy  issues  and  represents  a  comprehensive  approach  to
promoting biotechnology internationally.

Furthermore, the laboratories of the ICGEB develop  research  of  importance
to  bioindustries  and  its  members.  It  promotes   the   application   of
biotechnology in  fields  such  as  public  health,  industrial  production,
nutrition and environmental protection. The centre also offers  consultation
on scientific programmes in areas such as  plant  biology,  addressing  crop
improvement;  on  human  health,  addressing  infectious  disease   control,
vaccine production and molecular medicine; as well  as  on  basic  molecular
biology problems, addressing the control of cell proliferation.
Yes, our country has, through the  Department  of  Science  and  Technology,
applied for membership to the ICGEB Board of Governors which membership  has
been accepted, subject to payment of an annual membership fee of  US$37  000
as determined by the ICGEB scale of assessment. In  addition,  South  Africa
will have to deposit its instrument of accession with the United Nations  in
New York, through  which  we  will  declare  our  acceptance  of  the  ICGEB
statutes and indicate our commitment to the provisions contained therein.

The benefits of joining the ICGEB will  certainly  offer  South  Africa  new
opportunities  to  advance  our  national  biotechnology  strategy   through
participation   in   advanced   collaborative   research   programmes    and
comprehensive training schemes. We will also have  access  to  a  high-level
intergovernmental forum in which policy  issues  related  to  biosafety  and
technology are discussed. The possibility has also emerged that our  country
could be appointed to the position of auditor for the ICGEB  when  it  joins
the organisation.  Moreover,  South  Africa's  Auditor-General  will  derive
significant  benefits  from  securing  such  a  high-profile   international
assignment.

In fact, it must be emphasised that  the  Italian  government  has  already,
through a World Summit on Sustainable  Development  partnership  initiative,
committed approximately R10 million for the creation of  an  African  centre
for infectious diseases in our country, which will be  able  to  participate
in the ICGEB activities as an affiliated centre.

In conclusion, students of science and technology  systems  today  generally
recognise  that  one  of  the  critical  success  factors  for  science  and
technology is cross-pollination between different countries in  science  and
technology. South Africa's membership to this prestigious  body  will  go  a
long way towards  exposing  our  latent  science  potential,  in  university
laboratories across our country,  to  the  pioneering  research  of  eminent
scientists. And, it will be amiss of us not to acknowledge  the  efforts  of
the Department of Science and Technology  for  this  achievement,  which  is
certainly in line with our aspirations as a nascent democracy. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you  very  much,  hon  member.  That
concludes the debate. I shall now put the question.  The  question  is  that
the report be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 71,  I  shall  first  allow
provinces the opportunity to make their  declaration  of  vote  if  they  so
wish.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND RECREATION -
               SADC PROTOCOL ON CULTURE, INFORMATION AND SPORT

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I  call  upon  the  hon  chairperson  of  the
Select Committee, Mr D M Kgware.

Mr D M KGWARE: Madam Chair, hon members and colleagues,  the  SADC  Protocol
on Culture,  Information  and  Sport  before  this  House  today  represents
another chapter in our country's new history to  promote  unity,  solidarity
and co-operation amongst the peoples of the SADC region. It is  inspired  by
protocols of a similar kind which have seen passage through this House,  and
it recalls past contributions made by  our  neighbouring  states  to  ensure
that  they  collaborate  and  engage  with  our  country  at   all   levels.
Furthermore, it seeks to consolidate our institutions of culture, sport  and
education.

However, it includes other competencies such as copyright  and  neighbouring
rights seated with the Department of Trade and Industry. Since the  protocol
covers issues relevant to the different Ministries, it was forwarded to  the
different Ministers for input and adoption, and hence  they  have  concurred
with the content.

It is important to note that even before the  SADC  protocol  was  finalised
and presented for signing by the heads of  state,  there  had  already  been
cultural co-operation within the sectors.  The  following  examples  can  be
noted: the  SADC  music  festival  hosted  by  Zimbabwe,  the  SADC  theatre
festival hosted by Mozambique, the SADC exhibition  hosted  by  Namibia  and
the SADC dance festival hosted by Zimbabwe.

Within the context of the protocol, however,  the  Department  of  Arts  and
Culture hosted the  first  ever  SADC  multidisciplinary  festival  and  the
colloquium of SADC Ministers of culture for all  SADC  member  states  which
catered for the following categories: music, dance,  theatre,  storytelling,
creative arts and the heritage exhibition.

At the heart of  the  protocol  is  the  objective  of  ensuring  integrated
institutional mechanisms and co-operation in so far as  it  relates  to  the
policies, priorities and strategies of the culture, information  and  sports
co-ordinating unit.

The article relating to culture is guided by continental  and  international
conventions such as the  OAU  Cultural  Charter  for  Africa,  the  Cultural
Manifesto of Algiers of 1969, the Unesco Stockholm Action Plan  on  Cultural
Policies for Development, and the OAU  Dakar  Plan  of  Action  on  Cultural
Industries.

As we all should know, culture  is  an  integral  part  of  our  development
effort, not  only  in  our  country,  but  on  the  continent  as  a  whole.
Consequently, it is  imperative  that  we  protect  and  utilise  indigenous
knowledge that represents a major dimension of the continent's culture.

The article pertaining to sport is guided by the  Olympic  Charter  and  the
Supreme Council of Sport in Africa's General Assembly Declaration on  Sport.
We are aware that sport  plays  an  important  role  in  addressing  social,
economic and political problems and promotes a sense of pride and  community
integration.

We have all at one point or another been witness to the proven potential  of
the region in sport, and we believe that it is precisely that  human-centred
development brought about by participation in  sport  and  recreation  which
will provide the most essential means of achieving  the  objectives  of  the
protocol.

Furthermore, the protocol is mindful of the importance of information  as  a
prerequisite for political, economic, social and  cultural  development  and
therefore  ensures  full  co-operation  in  the  removal  of  barriers   for
independent, effective and transparent dissemination. Hence, it  encourages,
amongst other things, the establishment or strengthening of codes of  ethics
to  boost  public  confidence  and  professionalism   in   the   information
subsector.

Moreover, it encourages the joint investment,  production  and  exchange  of
film, video and audio information products in order to  reduce  reliance  on
imported information and cultural products. Also, it envisages a SADC  media
award which is intended to encourage and recognise the work  of  journalists
that promote regional integration in the fields of print, radio,  television
and photojournalism.

In conclusion, the changed conditions in the region  and  on  the  continent
have been recognised by all stakeholders. As I said earlier, our  agenda  is
based on national and regional priorities and development  plans  that  must
be prepared through participatory processes. The SADC Protocol  on  Culture,
Information and  Sport  is  irrefutable  proof  of  the  commitment  of  our
Government. I thank you. [Applause.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now  put
the question. The question is that the report be agreed  to.  In  accordance
with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces the opportunity  to  make  their
declarations of vote if they so wish.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote  in  favour  of,  or  against  or  abstain  from
voting.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am  sorry.  I  assumed  that  you  were  in
agreement; I knew that you would agree,  Mr  Ackerman.  All  provinces  have
voted in favour. I therefore declare the  report  agreed  to  in  accordance
with section 65 of the Constitution.

Hon members, you have heard  that  Gauteng  is  now  progressing  -  we  are
becoming a province that is multilingual. You heard  what  Dr  Conroy  said.
The business of the House will now be suspended. We  will  resume  at  14:00
this afternoon.

Business suspended at 12:32 and resumed at 14:10.
 THE EFFECT OF THE SEVERE DROUGHT AND DEVASTATING FIRES ON THE REPUBLIC AND
                                 OUR PEOPLE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, hon members, hon Minister and Deputy  Minister,
our country often experiences its fair share of disasters such as  localised
incidents of veld fires, seasonal flooding and  now,  lately,  a  period  of
severe  drought.  This  drought  continues  to  affect  the  livelihood   of
thousands of people,  especially  the  poorer  sections  of  our  population
living in rural areas and  the  farming  community  whose  survival  depends
largely on agriculture and stock farming, as  well  as  those  who  rely  on
employment in the abovementioned sectors.

Much as some sections of our population  attempt  to  mischievously  exploit
the plight of our people - especially the hardship being experienced by  our
farming community - through, among  other  things,  trying  to  depict  this
Government as uncaring, nothing could be further from the truth.
Rural communities rely on a combination of economic activities  and  sources
of subsistence and income, for example, crop production, livestock,  regular
wages as farmworkers, and pensions.

Because of the severe drought conditions in the Limpopo province  caused  by
the lack of a reasonable  amount  of  rainfall,  the  provincial  government
appealed to the national  Government  to  declare  some  districts  disaster
areas, which was ultimately done.  This  was  done  because  the  Government
acknowledged the hardship faced by the community as a result of the  drought
disaster.

For the past few months the MEC for agriculture has been  visiting  drought-
stricken areas, assessing the situation and  spearheading  the  delivery  of
relief measures. This Government  has  progressive  policies,  the  kind  of
policies that do not compartmentalise people  according  to  the  colour  of
their skin. Therefore, the allocation  and  distribution  of  resources  are
never done in a skewed manner the way they used to be.

A farmer remains a farmer, an asset and a contributor to  the  wellbeing  of
the economy of the country. He or she is and  will  always  be  regarded  as
such by this Government, whether he or she is black or white,  because  this
ANC Government is committed  to  making  life  better  for  each  and  every
citizen of this country. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Baie dankie, Voorsitter. Ek praat met  'n  mandaat  van
die Noord-Kaapkollegas en daarom praat ek oor die Noord-Kaap,  want  in  die
Noord-Kaap het wit, bruin en swart die afgelope week hand aan  hand  en  rug
aan rug geveg om hul toekoms en diÃ© van andere  te  beskerm  en  te  probeer
red.

Op Sondag 12 Oktober het  die  koppe  naby  die  Witbankmyn  aan  die  brand
geraak, en dit het baie vinnig versprei. Die  hele  boerderygemeenskap,  met
behulp van die rampbestuurskomitee en die weermagpersoneel van Lohatla,  het
tot laas Vrydag geveg om die brand onder  beheer  te  bring.  Die  brand  is
gekeer sodat dit nie die Mayeding- en  Wrenchville-woongebiede  sou  verwoes
nie. Teen Maandag was daar reeds 15 privaat bakkies stukkend  gery,  en  een
is totaal vernietig nadat dit van die berg af is.

Ongeveer 50Â 000 hektaar weiding is afgebrand; die  getal  diere  wat  gevrek
het, is nog nie bepaal nie. Die diere wat wel oorleef  moet  kos  kry,  want
daar is niks nie. Intussen is daar talle skenkings van voer aangebied,  maar
die Kuruman Boere-unie wat dit koÃ¶rdineer moet  die  vervoer  van  die  voer
betaal, en nÃ³g die Boere-unie, nÃ³g  die  gemeenskap  nÃ³g  die  LUR  het  die
fondse. Dringende hulp vir die vervoer van die  voer  kan  help  om  verdere
vrektes te verhoed, en daar is onduidelikheid oor hoe  daar  aansoek  gedoen
moet word om hulp vir diÃ© vervoer, wat dringend nodig is.

DiÃ© spesifieke gemeenskap is met 'n drie-dubbele slag geslaan. Verlede  jaar
het ongeveer 90 000 hektaar in dieselfde omgewing by  Severn  afgebrand,  en
geen hulp was beskikbaar  nie,  tÃ³Ã©  het  30Â 000  hektaar  afgebrand  nÃ¡  'n
militÃªre oefening. Die meeste van die 30 plase wat  afgebrand  het,  is  nog
nie weer in produksie nie en sal verskeie goeie  reÃ«nseisoene  nodig  hÃª  om
weer in produksie te kom. Ons versoek die agb Adjunkminister om, in die  lig
van  diÃ©  drie-dubbele  slag,  ook  met  die  Minister  van  Verdediging  in
verbinding te tree vir 'n vorderingsverslag  oor  die  beloofde  kompensasie
vir die brand wat verlede jaar vermoedelik deur die Weermag veroorsaak is.

Ongeveer 120 plaaswerkergesinne se werk en toekoms word bedreig as daar  nie
nou gou ramphulp  verskaf  word  nie.  Die  gebied  moet  as  'n  rampgebied
verklaar word, maar 'n rampgebied sonder hulp  beteken  niks  en  ons  pleit
vandag dat daar ingegryp sal word, en daadwerklike hulp verleen word.

Twee van die voorste brandslaners twee vrywilligers, het erg verbrand en  is
in  'n  kritieke  toestand  in  'n  kliniek  in  Johannesburg.   Hulle   het
onderskeidelik 87% en 76% brandwonde. Die kliniek verlang  'n  deposito  van
R300Â 000 per persoon. Die gemeenskap het 'n trust op die  been  gebring,  en
ongeveer R200Â 000 reeds ingesamel, maar daar is  nie  nog  geld  in  daardie
gebied nie, en die R600Â 000 moet vandag betaal word.
Ek weet nie wat ons gaan doen nie, maar die Minister moet kennis neem,  want
diÃ© twee vrywilligers was besig om 'n landbouramp te help beperk.  Die  twee
vrywilligers gaan moontlik nie herstel as hulle nie hulp kry nie.

Te midde van diÃ© ramp het die  Noord-Kaap  se  winterreÃ«nvalgebied  droogte.
Alle aanteelvee word reeds gevoer. Die meeste boere het al ongeveer 50%  van
hul lammeroes verloor. Ek het Kenhardt en omgewing laasweek  besoek  en  die
res van die Noord-Kaap  is  uiters  droog,  die  veldtoestande  is  swak  en
aanteelvee moet reeds gevoer word.

Daar is  samesprekings  tussen  die  Noord-Kaap  se  LUR  en  die  nasionale
departement om hulp. Ons is almal  in  die  proses  om  die  ``frontiers  of
poverty'' terug te druk, maar hÃ­Ã©r klop die armoede hard aan die deur.  Geld
wat vir die natuurrampe aangewend word, is goedkoop geld.  Dit  voorkom  dat
mense langtermyn-afhanklik word van  die  staat  se  aalmoese.  Die  landbou
herstel altyd en gee nie net voedselsekuriteit nie,  maar  ook  'n  heenkome
vir die meeste mense in die Noord-Kaap  Ã©n  in  Suid-Afrika,  en  daar  moet
daarna omgesien word.

Ten slotte, ons, die Noord-Kaaplede van diÃ© Raad,  sal  graag  met  die  agb
Minister en die departement oor hierdie saak in  gesprek  wil  tree.  Dankie
Voorsitter dat u die versoek om hierdie debat goedgekeur het, en ons  bedank
ook die gemeenskap van Kuruman en omgewing, wat onbaatsugtig deelgeneem  het
om die ramp dÃ¡Ã¡r onder  bedwang  te  bring.  Baie  dankie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Thank you very much, Chairperson. Chairperson,  I  talk
with a mandate from my Northern Cape colleagues and therefore I  am  talking
about the Northern Cape, because in the Northern Cape, white,  coloured  and
black communities fought hand in hand and side by side to try to save  their
own future and the future of others.

On Sunday, 12 October, the hills close to Witbank  mine  caught  fire  which
quickly spread. The  whole  farming  community,  assisted  by  the  disaster
management committee and Defence Force personnel  of  Lohatla,  fought  till
last Friday to try to bring the fire under control. The fire  was  prevented
from ravaging the Mayeding and Wrenchville residential areas. By Monday,  15
privately-owned bakkies had already  been  driven  to  pieces  and  one  was
totally destroyed after it crashed down the mountain.

About 50Â 000 hectares worth of  grazing  were  burnt  down;  the  number  of
animals that died has not been  determined  yet.  The  animals  that  indeed
survived must be fed, because there is nothing left. In  the  meantime  many
donations of feed have been offered, but the Kuruman  farmers'  union  which
is co-ordinating this, must pay for the transport of the  feed  and  neither
the  farmers'  union  nor  the  community  nor  the  MEC  have  these  funds
available. Urgent assistance with the transport of  the  feed  can  help  to
prevent further deaths and there  is  uncertainty  about  how  to  go  about
applying for this feed, which is urgently required.

This specific community was hit by a triple blow.  Last  year  about  90Â 000
hectares in the same  area  at  Severn  was  razed  and  no  assistance  was
available, then 30Â 000 hectares was razed after a  military  exercise.  Most
of the 30 farms which were destroyed are still not in  production  and  will
need a number of good rainy seasons to come into production. We request  the
hon Deputy Minister, in the light of this triple blow, to also get in  touch
with the  Minister  of  Defence  for  a  progress  report  on  the  promised
compensation for the fire which was apparently started by the Defence  Force
last year.

The hobs and future of about 120 farm labourer families  are  threatened  if
relief is not supplied soon. The area must be declared a disaster area,  but
a disaster area without relief means nothing, and we make  an  appeal  today
for intervention and real relief.

Two of the foremost firefighters, two  volunteers,  have  been  burnt  quite
severely and are in a critical condition in a clinic in  Johannesburg.  They
have 87% and 76% burns  respectively.  The  clinic  requires  a  deposit  of
R300Â 000 per person. The community established a trust  and  about  R200Â 000
has already been collected, but there is no more money in that area and  the
R600Â 000 must be paid today.

I do not know what we are going to do, but the Minister  must  be  informed,
because the two volunteers were busy  helping  to  contain  an  agricultural
disaster. The two volunteers will most probably not recover if they  do  not
get assistance.

Amidst  this  disaster,  the  Northern  Cape's  winter  rainfall   area   is
experiencing drought.  All  breeding  stock  are  already  being  fed.  Most
farmers have already lost 50% of their lambs. I visited  the  Kenhardt  area
last week and the rest of the North Cape is very dry, the condition  of  the
veld is poor and the breeding stock already has to be fed.

There are talks concerning aid between  the  Northern  Cape's  MEC  and  the
national department.  We  are  all  in  the  process  of  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, but here poverty is knocking hard on the  door.  Money
used for natural  disasters  is  cheap  money.  It  prevents  the  long-term
dependency of people on state  handouts.  Agriculture  always  recovers  and
does not only give food security, but also a livelihood to  most  people  in
the Northern Cape and in South Africa, and it must be looked after.

In conclusion, we, the Northern Cape members of  this  Council,  would  very
much like  to  enter  into  talks  with  the  Minister  and  the  department
regarding this matter. Thank you, Chairperson, for agreeing to  our  request
for this debate, and we also thank the people of Kuruman and surrounds,  who
unselfishly participated in  bringing  the  disaster  there  under  control.
Thank you very much.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOÃ«L: Madam Chairperson, it is a fact that in the recent  fires
people lost what they had acquired over many years;  and  it  was  destroyed
within a day. It is difficult for them to be where they  were  a  year  ago.
Hence we need to intervene and give assistance as  the  ANC-led  Government.
The ANC is committed to pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty.  Hence  we
have to extend our help to our fellow citizens who, in the blink of an  eye,
saw themselves left with nothing.

Fires are destructive and leave people with nothing to fall back  on.  These
fires disturb the whole set-up, and  life  becomes  unbearable  after  these
fires. People's health also suffers a lot  because  of  the  pollution  that
comes from these fires. The extent of the damage of  these  fires  leads  to
some timber companies being shut down,  and  that  means  many  people  lose
their jobs and the rate of unemployment escalates.

I would like to read part of a report which was compiled by Mr  J  J  Kruger
who is the chief  agricultural  development  technician  for  the  Nelspruit
area:


  The whole area is in an absolute crisis. There are, on most of  the  farm
  households, water crises because of pipes that were burned.


  I would like to explain more on the case of Mr  William  Mashaba  as  the
  space on the questionnaire was too little to give proper details  of  his
  case. His thatched roof  house  was  completely  destroyed,  because  the
  terrible gale force winds blew burning material from the  nearby  bluegum
  plantation onto the roof. This was a beautiful five-bedroomed house  with
  two bathrooms, a sitting room, lounge, two toilets,  kitchen  and  stoep.
  Everything inside the house was totally destroyed: furniture,  linen  and
  all their clothes. While completing the  form,  Mr  Mashaba  was  wearing
  clothes that his neighbour had lent him; he was walking barefoot  as  his
  shoes had also been burned.

Mr Mashaba is one of the small emerging farmers who had a  farm  around  the
Barberton area. The total cost,  including  the  farms  and  all  the  other
implements for his farm only, when evaluated, amounted  to  R1  795  676,00.
But the whole amount for the loss the  farmers  around  the  Barberton  area
suffered totalled more than R6 million.

When we speak about the effect around the Brondal  and  Schagen  area  where
there are plantations of avocado trees  and  other  agricultural  crops,  we
find that currently the estimate is about R153  547  938.  However,  we  are
still looking at a situation where there will  still  be  another  phase  of
evaluation to check whether the trees will be able to grow again  after  the
spring season or not.

There is instability when these fires  occur.  Some  people  have  to  leave
their places to seek areas that will provide them  with  shelter,  and  that
means there is an extra expenditure  that  is  added  to  each  individual's
budget - a budget which has already  been  burnt  out  by  the  fire,  which
leaves them with nothing. They are then starting from a deficit.

The co-operation that is given during the disaster by various  provinces  in
providing assistance is highly appreciated. It is good for people  to  share
skills with a common goal of assisting our Government where  they  can.  The
country would have lost millions of rands but because we have  firefighters,
and I must include the  volunteers,  who  are  dedicated  to  the  cause  of
extending their help when needed, we have saved much as  a  country  through
their assistance. We would like, as the ANC, to thank  them  all  for  their
determination and patriotism.

It is clear, hon members, that the migration from one settlement to  another
comes at a cost, and it comes to people who have nothing.  Malnutrition  and
famine become the order of the  day.  The  competition  becomes  stiffer  as
people will look for places where they can practise  agriculture  for  their
crops or for grazing land.

I would like also, hon Chairperson, before I conclude  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, may I just note that  my  speech  is  in  Afrikaans
while it is indicated as being in English. I don't know  whether  there  are
interpreters available.

Droogte en brande is sikliese kenmerke van die klimaat en  landbou,  en  dis
iets waarvoor ons nie die politici verantwoordelik  kan  hou  nie!  Waarvoor
die Regering wel verantwoordelik is, is dat hulpmaatreÃ«ls in plek moet  wees
om voorkomend en ondersteunend op te tree wanneer  die  natuur  ongenadiglik
toeslaan.

Sou dit niÃ© gebeur nie, is daar groot implikasies vir die land.  Die  meeste
dorpe en mense in plattelandse gebiede is direk afhanklik  van  die  wel  en
wee van die landbou. As die boere swaarkry, kry die werkers en die  slagters
en die bakkers en die klerewinkels en die dokters almal swaar.  Dit  bedreig
voedselsekuriteit en word 'n gesondheidsrisiko wat veral kinders  onder  die
ouderdom van vyf jaar die hardste tref.

Die El NiÃ±o-droogtes van 1991 en 1993 het ons gewys hoe nodig  rampmaatreÃ«ls
is om massiewe nasionale gevolge te vermy. Ongelukkig moet ek vandag sÃª  dat
'n groot en langdurige droogte volgens skatting vir ons  om  die  draai  lÃª.
Die  brande  en  droogte  wat  ...  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Drought and fires are cyclical characteristics of climate and  agriculture,
and that is something that we as  politicians  cannot  be  held  responsible
for! What the Government can in fact be held responsible  for  is  that  aid
measures have to be in place to act as prevention and  support  when  nature
strikes mercilessly.

If it does not happen, it may have grave implications for the country.  Most
towns and people in rural areas are directly dependent  on  the  welfare  of
agriculture. If the farmers  suffer  hardship,  then  the  workers  and  the
butchers and the bakers and the clothing shops and the doctors  all  suffer.
This threatens food security and becomes a  health  risk  that  particularly
hits children under the age of five the hardest.

The El NiÃ±o droughts of 1991 and  1993  showed  us  how  necessary  disaster
measures are in order to avoid massive national consequences.  Unfortunately
I have to say that a  massive  and  extended  drought  is  predicted  to  be
waiting round the corner for us. The fires and droughts that ...]
Is there a problem? [Interjections.] Hon member, won't you  just  listen  to
me? You don't have to look at me! [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Please proceed, hon member.  Order!  Allow  the
member to proceed, please.

Ms C BOTHA: Die brande en droogte wat ons in die  Vrystaat  ondervind,  raak
almal daar, nie net die boere  nie.  'n  Vriend  van  my,  Dries  Steyn  van
Hennenman, is ernstig  verbrand  tydens  'n  poging  om  brande  te  bestry.
Edenville se woonbuurt Ngwathe steier  onder  deurlopende  watertekorte  wat
aan die droogte toegeskryf kan word, en hulle kry tans goedgunstiglik  water
uit 'n boorgat op 'n naburige plaas vanwaar dit  met  'n  watertenk  aangery
word wat tydelik by die Weermag geleen word.

Ek is terdeÃ« bewus van die rampbestuurprogram wat in plek  is,  maar  watter
maatreÃ«ls is daar om toe te sien dat beskikbare hulp effektief en vinnig  by
die mense wat dit nodig het, uitkom? In  die  verlede  het  mense  ekonomies
ondergegaan terwyl hulle gewag het op beloofde hulp  wat  nie  betyds  gekom
het nie.
Die basis van ramphulp is nie om mense te vergoed vir hulle skade nie,  maar
net om hulle in staat te stel om weer te begin boer. Daarvoor benodig  hulle
lenings en subsidies om voer en saad te koop, lone te betaal en 'n  dak  oor
hulle koppe te kry. Spoed is essensieel, so ook maklike aansoekprosedures.

In die konteks van die kwesbaarheid van  veral  ons  landelike  gemeenskappe
wil ek graag 'n paar vrae aan die Minister rig, waarop ek  nie  onmiddellike
antwoorde verwag nie, maar dit sal waardeer. Het die departement die  vermoÃ«
om   onmiddellike   tussentydse   hulp   te   verleen?    Wie    neem    die
verantwoordelikheid  vir  hierdie  belangrike  taak?  Watter  institusionele
reÃ«lings  het  die  Regering  getref  om  voedselsekuriteit-,  gesondheids-,
ekonomiese  en  ander   risiko's,   soos   deur   die   El   NiÃ±o-verskynsel
geÃ¯llustreer, te hanteer?  Is  hierdie  reÃ«lings  genoegsaam  en  kan  hulle
oombliklik   in   werking   gestel   word?   Is   daar   genoegsame    vroeÃ«
waarskuwingstelsels in plek?

Terwyl 60% van Suid-Afrikaanse droogtes uit krag van El  NiÃ±o  verklaar  kan
word, word ander droogtes op ander plekke  gegenereer.  Het  ons  genoegsame
data-insamelingsmeganismes om hierdie verskynsels  te  antisipeer?  Is  daar
voldoende navorsingskapasiteit? Het die Regering 'n lys van die  kwesbaarste
gemeenskappe met betrekking tot droogte en brande, oor toegang tot  voedsel,
watervoorsiening en gesondheidsdienste? Watter rol word vir  nuwe  strukture
voorsien om in die plek van die kommando's, wat uitfaseer word, op  te  tree
om hulp aan te bied wanneer rampe ons tref? Word satellietwaarnemings  beoog
om die kondisie van veld en gepaardgaande brandgevaar te moniteer?

Daar is nog talle vrae, Minister, wat ek hoop u sal kan beantwoord. Ek  hoop
ook u sal ons die versekering kan gee dat boere en werkers, wat  reeds  hard
geslaan is deur die natuur, nie ook deur die burokrasie in die steek  gelaat
sal word nie.

Ten laaste is dit natuurlik eintlik net die Goeie Vader wat ons  kan  beskut
en beskerm, en ek hoor dit het al op verskeie plekke gereÃ«n,  maar  soos  'n
boervrou moet ek julle sÃª  dis  nie  genoeg  nie!  Dankie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: The fires and droughts that we are  experiencing  in  the  Free
State affect everyone there, not only the farmers. A friend of  mine,  Dries
Steyn van Henneman, suffered severe burns in an attempt to fight the  fires.
Edenville's  suburb  of  Ngwathe  is  staggering  under   continuous   water
shortages that can be ascribed to the  drought,  and  they  are  at  present
kindly receiving water from a borehole on a neighbouring farm from where  it
is transported in a water tank that is temporarily borrowed from the Army,

I am well aware of the Disaster Management programme that is in  place,  but
what measures are there to ensure that the  available  aid  effectively  and
quickly reaches the people  that  need  it.  In  the  past  people  suffered
economic ruin while they were waiting for the promised  aid  which  did  not
reach them timeously.

The basis for disaster aid is not to compensate people for damages,  but  to
enable them to start farming again. For this they need loans  and  subsidies
to purchase feed and seed, to pay wages and to get a roof over their  heads.
Speed is essential, as well as easy application procedures

In the context of the vulnerability of particularly our  rural  communities,
I would like to direct a few questions to the Minister, and I do not  expect
immediate answers but would appreciate it.  Does  the  department  have  the
ability to provide immediate interim aid? Who takes responsibility for  this
important task? What institutional arrangements has the Government  made  to
deal with food security, health, economic and other  risks,  as  illustrated
by the El NiÃ±o phenomenon? Are these arrangements adequate and can  they  be
implemented immediately? Are  there  sufficient  early  warning  systems  in
place?

While 60% of South African droughts can  be  explained  by  El  NiÃ±o,  other
droughts  in  other  places  are  generated.  Do  we  have  sufficient  data
collection mechanisms to  anticipate  these  phenomena?  Is  there  adequate
capacity for  research?  Does  the  Government  have  a  list  of  the  most
vulnerable communities with respect to drought and  fire,  about  access  to
food, water supply and health services? What role is foreseen  for  the  new
structures to react in the place of the commandos,  that  are  being  phased
out, to lend assistance when we  are  struck  by  disasters?  Are  satellite
observations envisaged  to  monitor  the  condition  of  the  veld  and  the
accompanying fire hazards?

There are many more questions, Minister, that I hope you  will  be  able  to
answer. I also hope that you will be able to  give  us  the  assurance  that
farmers and workers, who have already been hit hard by nature, will  not  be
let down by bureaucracy.

Finally, it is of course only the Good Father that can protect and keep  us,
and I hear that it has rained in several places, but as a boervrou  [farming
woman] I must tell you it is not enough! Thank you.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson, hon Ministers  and  the  hon  House,  an
environmental meteorologist, Johan van den Berg, says there is currently  no
El NiÃ±o phenomenon affecting South African weather.

At the moment the temperatures of the oceans surrounding  South  Africa  are
normal, and we can expect normal, below normal, or  above  normal  rains  in
the  various  provinces.  My  own  cultural  and  nonscientific  observation
relating to the calving of local herds of cattle is that  there  is  calving
of more female calves than male ones, and this is interpreted as the  coming
of a good year.

The  North  West  province  has  been  affected  by  severe   droughts   and
devastating, sporadic fires. The past rainy  season  ended  in  February  so
that the dry winter season, which started earlier in March, was longer  than
usual having lasted for nearly eight months to October. The available  grass
therefore did not reach its maximum growth and the  available  cattle  feeds
were very expensive. This problem has been further  compounded  by  sporadic
fires that break out from time to time on the farms and in communal areas.

In the past, when a fire broke out, the community would co-operate and  join
hands to extinguish the fire. However, it is  different  today.  People  who
don't own cattle argue that when they approach the cattle owners  to  buy  a
slaughter beast, the cattle owner in determining  the  price  would  stretch
out all his fingers and even add his toes in order to make it  as  expensive
as possible. This is the result of nonco-operation when a  fire  breaks  out
in a communal area or on a farm.

Notwithstanding the above, the province has received good widespread  rains,
which lasted two successive days last weekend and measured  up  to  80mm  in
certain places. In certain areas of the province some large stock and  small
stock which were in poor shape as  a  result  of  the  severe  drought  were
killed by the cold spell that accompanied the rain.

It is unlikely that this is the outbreak of anthrax  disease,  as  has  been
alleged  in  the  electronic  media.  Preliminary  investigations  are  also
discounting this allegation. However, more detailed investigations  will  be
undertaken in Potchefstroom and Pretoria today to  determine  the  cause  of
the deaths. I thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mev A M VERSFELD:  Chairperson.

...  landbou   is   die   sektor   wat   die   meeste   afhanklik   is   van
weersomstandighede in Suid-Afrika. Daarom doen  die  DA  'n  beroep  op  die
Regering om slaggereed te wees vir rampe, hetsy vuur, droogte of storms.

In  die  verlede  het  die  Departement  van   Landbou   'n   afdeling   van
landboukrediet gehad wat assessore in diens gehad het om skade  te  bereken;
nie berokken nie, bereken. Met die verval  van  die  Landboukredietraad  het
hierdie assessore ook verdwyn, en het die  Landbank  die  funksie  oorgeneem
van die Landboukredietraad. Maar  die  Landbank  het  geen  voetwerkers  wat
skadeberekening kan doen van die skade wat plaasgevind het nie.
Die DA doen daarom die beroep op die Regering om  slaggereed  te  wees.  Die
nodige fondse, goeie strategieÃ«, goeie beleid  en  goeie  beginsels  is  nie
goed genoeg as dit nie spoedeisend gedoen word en daar vinnig opgetree  word
nie. As landbou ly, ly Suid-Afrika, as Suid-Afrika ly, ly  Afrika.  Ek  dank
u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Agriculture is the sector most dependent on  weather  conditions  in  South
Africa. Therefore  the  DA  appeals  to  the  Government  to  be  ready  for
disasters, be they fire, drought or storms.

In the past  the  Department  of  Agriculture  had  an  agricultural  credit
division that employed assessors to evaluate damages; not to cause,  but  to
evaluate the damage. With the dissolution of the Agricultural  Credit  Board
these assessors disappeared too, and the Land Bank took over  the  functions
of the Agricultural Credit Board. However, the Land Bank has no  footworkers
to assess the damage that has been suffered.

The DA therefore appeals to the Government to  be  prepared.  The  necessary
funds, sound strategies, good  policy  and  good  principles  are  not  good
enough if it is not done urgently  and  action  is  not  taken  quickly.  If
agriculture suffers, South Africa suffers, if South Africa  suffers,  Africa
suffers. I thank you.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chair, the shortage of rain began in March 2001 in  Limpopo.
A year later, March 2002, the drought started to tighten its grip. The  rain
that fell during October till December 2002 could not raise  the  levels  of
the dams or rehabilitate and sustain fauna and flora, hence  the  high  rate
of livestock and game mortalities that took place. The most  affected  areas
stretch from Messina, further down to north  Mutale,  down  to  the  western
region of Potgietersrus and further down to  the  central  region,  and  the
Bochum and Pietersburg areas. Those areas were heavily affected.

Of critical concern to the farmer is the following question: To what  extent
is the SA Weather  Service,  given  that  it  is  the  custodian  of  expert
knowledge in metereology, able to predict  droughts,  the  degree  of  their
severity, cycles, etc,  to  enable  farming  communities  to  take  informed
decisions? This is a crucial question posed by a farmer.

The UDM, however,  appreciates  and  commends  the  Government  for  the  R6
million grant to assist communal farmers who have sustained great losses  of
their livestock, although R87 million was the initial relief fund  requested
on the basis of a nucleus of 125 head of livestock per farmer. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you,  Madam
Chairperson. I must thank the members for the  information  that  they  have
provided. Most of it is quite well known  in  the  department.  We  have  an
extensive amount of information coming to us. I have the latest report  with
me on the  2003  summer  season,  which  is  compiled  by  the  department's
Directorate of Agricultural Risk and Disaster Management.

I must perhaps just say to the provinces that I have the  reports  from  all
the  provinces,  except  the  following,  which  have  not  submitted  their
reports: Gauteng, the North West and  the  Northern  Cape.  These  provinces
have had considerable problems in this regard. I do suggest  that  you  talk
to your departments in the provinces.

I must say that it is quite interesting that although we  have  three  Bills
on the Order Paper today, as well as this debate, I do not see  one  MEC  of
agriculture here. In fact, I have counted  the  delegates  here  present.  I
think I counted about 26 or 27. That is very disappointing. The NCOP  always
asks the national Ministers to be present, and then we come here and  we  do
not even see full delegations from the provinces,  not  a  speaker  for  the
MECs. Oh, there are about 33 members present. The number has grown  since  I
counted. Isn't the membership something like  90?  [Interjections.]  We  can
discuss that at another stage. I just want to say  that  we  do  expect  the
MECs to make inputs from their provinces in this type of debate.

Could I just comment that the hon delegate from  the  North  West  is  quite
correct. There is no El Ni-Ã±o at the moment. We have a weak La  NiÃ±a,  which
is actually on the verge  of  disappearing.  The  problem  is  the  previous
rainfall season of 2002 to 2003, which was below  normal.  Late  rains  were
received everywhere this year, and some farmers, I know, welcomed  the  late
rains as they had planted under dry land conditions,  while  others  started
planting. This was late, especially for the small-scale farmers.  They  have
the biggest problems in terms of reacting to these  conditions.  During  the
season the entire country experienced a dry spell and high temperatures.

What we also need to say in this type of debate is that  one  must  look  at
farming methods, and that  is  a  task  of  the  provincial  departments  of
agriculture, which have the extension services, especially in very  deprived
traditional areas. Overgrazing is a problem there -  let  us  say  that  for
once and all. It is also understandable for  socioeconomic  reasons  why  we
have that. But we have to work on that  and  also  on  farming  methods  and
ploughing  methods  in  general.  The  point  is  that  the  dams  and   the
underground water were affected by the  last  season.  We  are  expecting  a
normal season and we hope that it is going to go well.

Then, of course, we have these fires, which are becoming a terrible  problem
in South Africa at  the  moment.  You  must  know  that  veld  fire  control
legislation is  in  the  hands  of  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry. Under that legislation, which is  not  satisfactory,  you  have  a
system of local associations of fire prevention. Those associations  do  not
work everywhere.

In terms of that legislation there is a requirement  that  every  farm  must
have a firebreak around it  on  all  its  borders.  That  is  not  happening
because of the cost involved in making those firebreaks.  This  is  actually
also not a very  wise  prescription,  because  firebreaks  must  be  planned
according to geography and not according to artificial  farm  borders  which
sometimes do not fit the ecology of the area. The long-term solution is  the
insurance legislation that  we  are  working  on  at  the  moment.  We  have
developed policies, and I am surprised that the delegates have not read  the
policies on agricultural risk prevention which have been  developed  in  our
department. I think that you should ask for a briefing about  this  in  your
standing committee.

We  have  developed  policy  and  draft  legislation  with  regard  to   the
management of agricultural risks. This will very soon be  published  for  an
extensive participation exercise.  The  agriculture  risk  insurance  system
that we are developing must obtain a subscription, to a very  large  extent,
of farmers - about 60% - and then some insurance companies  will  underwrite
it and reinsure it, and the state will also  put  money  into  that  scheme.
That is the way it is done in America,  for  example.  This  will  cost  the
state money, but it is the best solution in the long run.

So, over a number of years this matter  has  been  developed  and  quite  an
extensive  consultation  process  has  already  been   followed   with   the
agriculture sector where this matter  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  our
strategy. We hope that the current consultative process will soon lead to  a
greater understanding of the needs in this sector.

Perhaps, partly answering delegate  Botha's  questions,  the  Department  of
Agriculture has also established a  national  agrometereological  committee.
The members  include  representatives  from  the  relevant  directorates  at
national level, the provincial departments of agriculture,  the  Agriculture
Research Council and the SA Weather Bureau. This committee issues a  monthly
advisory to the sector if the provinces give  their  information,  which  is
not always the case as I  have  said.  The  advisories  need  to  be  widely
distributed among all management levels down to  the  communities.  I  would
really ask the delegates of this honourable body to assist in  this  regard.
Any media can be used to disseminate the advisories.

The current impact due to drought should have been  minimised.  We  have  in
our advisories continually advised farmers and  the  provincial  departments
of agriculture, through their extension services, to reduce their  livestock
in the light of the current conditions and to  be  prepared  regarding  veld
fires.

You must distinguish three aspects of veld  fires.  Firstly,  there  is  the
preventive aspect. What do you do  to  prevent  veld  fires?  This  includes
making fires, getting organised in certain communities where  there  is  the
risk of veld fires - everything possible that you  can  do  to  prevent  the
fires. The second aspect is perhaps the most difficult one and that is  what
you do during a veld fire - the actions required. It is not always  possible
to get helicopters out to an area. The third aspect is, of course,  what  to
do after  the  fires  have  taken  place.  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                  RESTITUTION OF LAND RIGHTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I now call on the  chairperson  of  the  Select
Committee the Rev Moatshe.

Rev P MOATSHE:  Hon  Chairperson,  the  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members  and
comrades, I just wanted to rectify what the Deputy Minister has  hinted  at.
We are glad that he  is  concerned  about  attendance  in  this  House,  but
obviously he must  also  be  concerned  about  attendance  in  the  National
Assembly.

This is a special day. We were called specially to come and debate, and,  as
a result of that, we were unable to invite MECs to be part of  this  debate.
Obviously, we always try to have them here and they do respond  accordingly.
I just wanted to rectify that. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Sorry, Chairperson ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Yes?

Mr P A MATTHEE: May I ask the member a question?
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The member who is speaking now, would you  take
your seat? Would you be prepared to take a question, Rev Moatshe?

Rev P MOATSHE: Yes.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Yes?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, would the  member  agree  with  me  that  on  a
counting of the members here I find 36 out of 54, which gives me  66,6%  and
not what the Minister indicated. I think the record should be put  straight.
Would he agree with me on that? [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Proceed, hon member.

Rev P MOATSHE: Thank you, Chairperson. I do not think I have to  respond  to
that. [Laughter.] I will take him to  task  after  the  session.  It  is  an
honour for me to debate this important subject that has  a  bearing  on  the
entire South African society if we address the land question.
Fundamental to our struggle for liberation was the element of restoring  the
dignity and respect of the people of South Africa, and also  the  indigenous
people of our country in part, and the  people  of  the  African  continent.
Therefore today we are dealing with this significant piece  of  legislation,
which touches the conscience of our people. Access to our land is  a  source
of survival for our people, especially those living in rural areas.

This Bill, therefore, seeks to amend the  Restitution  of  Land  Rights  Act
which  was  passed  in  November  1994  which,  inter  alia,  addressed  the
restitution of those rights in land that were dispossessed after 1913  as  a
result of the apartheid legislation.

Agb Voorsitter, laat my toe om 'n paar woorde uit die Heilige Skrif  aan  te
haal wat te doene het met diÃ© grondsaak. Levitikus 25, vanaf vers  14,  lees
soos volg: [Hon Chairperson, allow me to quote a few words  that  deal  with
this matter of land from the Holy Scriptures. Leviticus 25, from  verse  14,
goes as follows:]
  If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from  him,  do  not
  take advantage of each other. You are to buy from your countryman on  the
  basis of the number of years since the jubilee, and he is to sell to  you
  on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.

The bearing here is that there is a time  according  to  the  Gospel  -  the
Jubilee Year - which is since 1994, when we took this land over. It  has  to
be declared a Jubilee Year where land is given back to the rightful owners.

That is what the Gospel says, and  therefore  ...  [Interjections.]  ...  we
thought everybody would be willing  to  return  the  land  to  its  rightful
owners, who were robbed of that land by the Land Act of 1913. It  was  again
thought that we would all be reasonable and agree to speed  up  the  process
by resolving land claims by way of settlement agreements, rather than  being
forced to go to court. This meant, therefore, that land  claims  were  based
on the willing-buyer-willing-seller principle or arrangement.
The main purpose  of  this  amendment  is  to  fast-track  land  claims  and
therefore considerably reduce and alleviate the  huge  land  claims  backlog
that we now have. Clause 4, therefore,  allows  the  Minister  to  purchase,
acquire or expropriate land  for  the  purposes  of  restitution  and  other
reform purposes. In future, therefore, our Minister will not have  to  reach
an agreement with relevant landowners or obtain a court order  in  order  to
expropriate land.

Another issue of concern is of the people who were very  sceptical  of  this
process when it was initiated, and who  have  now  failed  to  honour  their
deadlines  for  their  claims.  Because  they  did  not  believe  that   our
Government would deliver on its promises, they did not lodge  their  claims.
Some were also not properly informed  about  the  promises  and  missed  the
boat. On seeing now that claims were  being  settled,  they  requested  that
they be given another opportunity. That is also  an  issue  that  needs  our
consideration.

Agb Voorsitter, dit is waar, die  Skrif  sÃª  nogmaals  dat  ons  nie  rykdom
bymekaar mag maak waartoe roes en mot en dief toegang het nie.  Dit  wil  sÃª
ons mag nie selfsugtig wees nie; ons moet bereid wees  om  onder  mekaar  te
verdeel. [Hon Chairperson, it is true, the Scriptures say  once  again  that
we may not gather wealth to which destruction and thieves have access.  This
means to say we may not be selfish; we must be prepared to share  among  one
another.]

The  opposition  took  issue  with  the  power  given  to  the  Minister  to
expropriate land  without  a  court  order,  and  that  the  land  could  be
expropriated for other  land  reform  purposes  besides  restitution.  Those
concerns  are  just  based  on  white  fears  and  depict  and  reflect  the
conservative mindset which contributes to the resistance to the  process  of
transformation of land in this country. Those people, inclusive  of  members
of Agri SA and the Transvaal Agricultural Union, should not  be  allowed  to
undermine the delivery and pace of land reform objectives in this country.

What such people fail to realise is that the law of  this  country  binds  a
Minister. Whenever a landowner or any affected person is not satisfied  with
a decision and action of the Minister, he or she has recourse to our  courts
of law - up to and including the  Constitutional  Court.  Cognisance  should
also be taken of the fact that the constitutional rights of a  landowner  or
holder of a right in land  whose  property  or  right  is  expropriated,  is
endorsed in section 42E(3) of the Act, wherein it  is  stated  that  section
25(3)  of  the  Constitution  should  be  complied  with  for  expropriation
purposes.

The amendment proposed is not in any way taking away the  right  of  current
owners to appeal decisions of the Minister. It prevents  unnecessary  delays
in the process of restitution by unco-operative  landowners.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chairperson. Section  34  of  the  Constitution
determines:


  Everyone has the right to have any dispute that can be  resolved  by  the
  application of law decided in a fair public hearing before  a  court  or,
  where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum.

The chairperson's remark in the  standing  committee  on  17  September  was
that: ``The Government would not be arrogant in the  expropriation  of  land
and,  therefore,  an  emotional  response  to   the   amendments   was   not
justified.'' Yet he justified the vicious and emotional  attack  on  the  DA
for not participating in the process. The DA is  being  lambasted  as  being
against restitution and transformation, and I would like to  put  on  record
that the DA fully and enthusiastically supports  this  restitution  process,
even to the extent of rejecting the Land Affairs budget since  it  falls  so
far short of what  is  needed  to  bring  this  shameful  chapter  that  was
introduced by the National Party in our history to a close. The DA  rejected
this Bill in its entirety and believes that it may be unconstitutional.

Soos ek in die komitee aangedui het, sal ek my redes in hierdie Huis  bekend
maak. Die basiese beginsel van vrye demokrasie is die skeiding van die  drie
sfere van regering:  tussen  die  wetgewende,  uitvoerende  en  regsplegende
gesag. As daar nie skeiding van hierdie magte is nie, is dit Ikabod vir  die
demokrasie en vryheid.

Dit is dan ook die rede waarom die DA hierdie  wetgewing  in  sy  totaliteit
verwerp en ons verwerp die beginsel  -  iets  wat  die  Nuwe  NP  nooit  sal
verstaan nie, aangesien hulle nog altyd beginselloos was.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Die angeltjies en die stertjies wat sogenaamd verwyder is, is  'n  voorbeeld
van onkunde en/of diensbaarheid as Hansie my  kneg.  Die  angel  in  hierdie
wetsontwerp  is  die  regsplegende  gesag  wat  aan  die  Minister  en  haar
amptenare gegee word - beslis nie 'n onafhanklike tribunaal of forum nie.

Maar hoekom hierdie wetgewing? U sien, dit is nou  weer  verkiesing  en  dit
sal dan glo die huidige proses van restitusie vertraag  -  dit  is  absolute
snert! Die DA is op rekord dat ons die Grondeisehof geskakel  het  en  gevra
het of hulle oorwerk is. Hulle antwoord was: ``Glad nie,  ons  wag  op  sake
van die Minister.''
Nie net die DA nie, maar beide Cosatu en AgriSA het  'n  baie  goeie  begrip
van die wetgewing en stem saam dat hierdie wetgewing nie 'n  verkorting  van
die restitusieproses is nie, aangesien die hofproses van appÃ¨l nog  bestaan.
Dit is dus nie 'n verkorting van die restitusieproses nie, dit is  slegs  'n
verskuiwing van die regsproses. Dit  plaas  nou  die  onus  op  die  huidige
eienaar om na onteiening as die nuwe eiser na die hof te gaan, nie  oor  die
eienaarskap van die grond nie, maar slegs oor die prys wat hy  sal  ontvang.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[As I indicated in the committee, I will be making my reasons known in  this
House. The basic principle of free democracy is the separation of the  three
spheres of government; the separation of the legislative, the executive  and
the judicial powers. Without the separation of these powers it is  all  over
with democracy and freedom.

This is the reason why the DA has rejected this legislation in its  entirety
and why  we  reject  the  principle  -  something  the  New  NP  will  never
understand, as they have  always  been  unprincipled.  [Interjections.]  The
little stings and  tails  that  were  supposed  to  have  been  removed  are
representative of ignorance and/or subservience, like a dogsbody. The  sting
in this Bill is the power of administration of  justice  that  is  conferred
upon the  Minister  and  her  officials  -  definitely  not  an  independent
tribunal or forum.

But why this legislation? You see, with the elections  coming  around  again
this would supposedly slow down the current pace of restitution  -  that  is
absolute nonsense! The DA is on record as having contacted the  Land  Claims
Court to ask them whether they were overworked. Their answer was:  ``Not  at
all, we are awaiting claims from the Minister.''

Not only the DA, but both Cosatu and AgriSA have a very  good  understanding
of this legislation and agree that this legislation does  not  constitute  a
curtailment of the restitution  process,  because  the  court's  process  of
appeal is still there. So this is  not  a  curtailment  of  the  restitution
process, but merely a shift in the legal process. It now places the onus  on
the current owner, after expropriation, to approach the  court  as  the  new
claimant, not with regard to the ownership of the land, but only in  respect
of the price that he is to receive.]

No administrative justice Act can rectify this process. Why  have  the  Land
Claims Court working on a claim,  if  the  Minister  can  achieve  the  same
result through a stroke of the pen? This process sidesteps the  Land  Claims
Court.

There is a saying that good law is written for bad  Ministers  -  that  does
not mean that bad law should be written for good Ministers. The  chairperson
went so far as to say on record that she will only use  this  measure  as  a
last resort. ``As a last resort'' is not in the definition.  It,  therefore,
means at the Minister's discretion. The rule of law is  the  cornerstone  of
our Constitution, and not rule by discretion.

I conclude with the words of our former beloved President, Nelson Mandela:
  The key to the protection of any  minority  is  to  put  core  civil  and
  political rights beyond the reach of temporary majorities by guaranteeing
  them as fundamental human rights, enshrined in a democratic Constitution.



I thank you, Madam Chair.

Nk B THOMSON: Sihlalo, sikhuluma ngodaba  olubi  oluvusa  uhlevane  njengoba
ubonile nje  ukuthi  uVersveld  impela  uma  elubeka  lolu  daba  uze  afune
ukukhala  izinyembezi  ngoba  engafuni  ukuthi   bahlukane   nodedangendlale
bamapulazi abo. [Inhlokomo.]

Kubuhlungu-ke ngoba, ngokwethu ukucabanga, besithi mhlawumbe abantu  abafana
ne-DA bazokwazi ukubonga lo Hulumeni owathatha  leli  zwe,  ngoba  mhlawumbe
ukuba akuyena owathatha leli zwe  ngabe  seliwumlotha  phela  abantu  befuna
umhlaba wabo owathathwa ngesinxele.

Kuyiqiniso  elingephikiswe  lelo  ukuthi  lo   mhlaba   okukhulunywa   ngawo
ungumhlaba  ongathathangwa  ngesandla   esihle.   Ikakhulukazi   bona   laba
abandlebezikhanyilanga  abasebenzisani  kahle  noHulumeni  ekutheni  umhlaba
ubuyiselwe kubantu, yingakho-ke sesiqhamuka naleli  su  lokuthi  sichibiyele
lo mThetho. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, we are addressing a  very  sensitive  issue.  As
you may have noticed, when  Versveld  speaks  about  it,  she  almost  cries
because she does not want to let go of their huge farms. [Interjections.]

It is sad because,  in  terms  of  our  own  thinking,  we  thought  perhaps
organisations like the DA would  thank  this  Government,  which  took  this
country because if it was not this Government, it would be in ashes;  people
wanting their land back, which was taken unlawfully.

It is an indisputable fact that this land we are  talking  about  was  taken
unlawfully, especially by those whites who do not  want  to  work  with  the
Government to bring the land back to the people. That  is  why  we  came  up
with this strategy to amend this Act.]

The amendments proposed in this Bill reinforce  the  truth  that  unless  we
settle the land question, we do not have a country,  and  if  we  handle  it
badly we tear South Africa into pieces. If we manage it well, we create  the
foundations for a truly united nation. We  should  bear  in  mind  that  the
massively unequal distribution of land is not just an unfortunate legacy  of
apartheid, it is the totally unacceptable continuation of apartheid.

This amendment, therefore, seeks to expedite the  land  restitution  process
in this country so as to be able to deal on the  same  par  with  human  and
social  questions  and  problems;  and  also   works   towards   the   total
deracialisation of the economy, and the full achievement of a  secure  legal
regime for property rights that is respected by all.

While everybody has a contribution to make in resolving the  land  question,
we, in the ANC, have a special responsibility. The claim to effectively  and
efficiently restore land rights is part of  our  history.  If  we  turn  our
backs on the effective handling of the land question, we are no  longer  the
ANC.

The main purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister to acquire  or
expropriate land for purposes of restitution of rights to the  land  without
necessarily acquiring a court order. As may be seen in section  42D  of  the
principal Act, the Minister has  limited  powers  to  acquire  land  in  the
absence of a court order, unless an agreement is reached with the  landowner
as one of the interested parties. It should also be noted now that there  is
resistance from many landowners as far as co-operation with the  restitution
process is concerned.

Further problems which arise from the present provisions of the  restitution
Act are that although the land may originally be  intended  for  restitution
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!
Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, may I ask the hon member a question?

Ms B THOMSON: Yes, you can.

Ms C BOTHA: Could  you  specify  the  number  of  cases  where  delays  have
occurred in the settlement of land claims?

Ms B THOMSON: Can you repeat that?

Ms C BOTHA: Hon member, you mentioned that there were delays  in  connection
with land claims. Could you specify the number?

Ms B THOMSON: No, I wouldn't specify the number but I know that there  is  a
delay. I would't specify the number - not at this stage.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Proceed, hon member.

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, further problems which  arise  from  the  present
provision of the restitution Act are that although the land  may  originally
be intended for restitution, subsequent events may indicate  that  the  land
should rather be used for other land reform purposes. This Bill,  therefore,
rectifies that anomaly.

It should also be borne in mind that section  42E  also  requires  that  the
relevant expropriation must be procedurally fair by  prescribing  compliance
with section 3 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act of 2000.

Angazi-ke ngoba umhlonishwa  uVersveld  uyayiphikisa  leyo.  [I  don't  know
because hon Versveld disagrees with that.]

It should also be appreciated that this Bill, as  presented  at  this  time,
will benefit a lot of our  rural  people  who  feel  legitimate  anger  from
decades of dispossession and impoverishment. There are  also  several  hard-
headed  economic  imperatives  for  tackling   rural   reconstruction.   The
amendment will also create  a  big  opportunity  for  increasing  productive
employment, which is a crucial objective but difficult to achieve.
There is an uncomfortable historical fact that such claims will not go  away
but fester  into  decades  of  debilitating  conflict  or  war.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mnr A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Voorsitter,  baie  dankie.  Ek  sal  later  in  die
privaatheid met die agb Moatshe oor die uitleg  van  Levitikus  wil  gesels.
Miskien stem ons nie heeltemal saam oor sy interpretasie nie.

Die Nuwe NP en die ANC  was  in  verskeie  gesprekke  gewikkel  oor  hierdie
wetsontwerp wat uitgeloop  het  op  wysigings  wat  in  die  gekose  komitee
aanvaar is, bespreek is en wat  die  wet  aanvaarbaar  gemaak  het.  Hierdie
wysigings verseker dat die wet net op die restitusie-eise toegespits is;  en
dat die agterdog wat die DA geskep het,  dat  dit  algemene  grondhervorming
insluit, is uit  die  weggeruim.  Dit  maak  ook  voorsiening  daarvoor  dat
gedeeltes van 'n plaas wat na 'n onteiening  nutteloos  of  onekonomies  mag
wees, ingesluit kan word by die onteiening. Die grondeienaar  hoef  dus  nie
daarmee opgeskeep te sit nie. In ooreenstemming met die ANC en die  Nuwe  NP
is  die  onteienings  ook  onderhewig  aan  die   Wet   op   Administratiewe
Geregtigheid wat die agb lid Versveld uit die aard  van  die  saak  nog  nie
gelees het nie.

Die Minister kan nie arbitrÃªr te werk gaan  nie,  want  die  administratiewe
proses sal altyd aan geregtelike oorsig  onderhewig  wees.  Die  bedrag  van
vergoeding kan ook deur 'n hof beslis word. Nou waarom hierdie wet? vra  die
agb Versveld. Sodat die DA dit kon misbruik en hoereer met mense se  emosies
daarbuite. Dit is wat hulle daarmee gedoen het. Maar die werklike  rede  is:
die Grondwet sÃª daar moet so 'n wet wees. Artikel 25 (2), gaan lees 'n  slag
as jy kan, bepaal dat onteienings slegs deur middel van 'n algemene wet  kan
plaasvind en hier is die algemene wet nou. Dit  sal  tog  help  as  die  agb
Versveld nie soos 'n  opregte  viswyf  hier  tekere  gaan  nie  en  dit  ...
[Gelag.]

Die departement het verder onderneem om twee bepalings  in  die  Handleiding
tot   Restitusie   in   te    voeg,    naamlik    om    te    voorkom    dat
grondverwaarlosingsvereistes dit oorneem en dat die staat moet  toesien  dat
die eiser genoegsaam bemagtig word om met die  boerdery  te  kan  voortgaan.
Hierdie wet sal slegs as laaste uitweg gebruik word  wanneer  daar  nie  oor
prys ooreengekom kan word nie. Die proses om vas te stel of  'n  eis  geldig
is en vertoÃ« wat daarvoor gerig kan word,  is  nog  presies  dieselfde.  Die
Nuwe NP is egter nie oortuig dat diÃ© wet  'n  towerstaf  is  wat  restitusie
noemenswaardig gaan versnel nie.

Die departement moet eerder toesien dat die masjinerie van Grondsake en  die
kommissarisse optimaal funksioneer en dat genoegsame fondse  beskikbaar  is.
'n Voldoende moniteringstelsel om vordering en  koÃ¶rdinering  vas  te  stel,
ontbreek ook steeds. Dit is waaroor die wysiginswetsontwerp in wese  handel,
maar  die  DA  en  die  Vryheidsfront  met  hulle  regse  boerderyarm,   die
Transvaalse Landbou-unie sÃª dat die Minister omseil die  Parlement  met  die
wetsontwerp. Omseil, maar hier staan ons in die Parlement.  Dit  is  die  DA
wat die Parlement ignoreer. In die portefeuljekomitee het die DA  geraas  en
blaas, maar nie een wysiging voorgestel nie. Na die debat in  die  Nasionale
Vergadering ignoreer die DA die Parlement se hoÃ«r Huis en sÃª hulle gaan  die
President versoek om nie die wet te promulgeer nie. Wat 'n belaglikheid!  In
die gekose gekomitee sit die DA toe tjoepstil. Raas en blaas nie  eers  nie.
Probeer nie die wet verbeter nie. Stem net daarteen met die  dreigement  dat
die DA sy redes hier  in  diÃ©  debat  sal  gee.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. I would like to  chat
to the hon Moatshe about the interpretation of Leviticus  in  private  later
on. Perhaps we don't quite agree with his interpretation.

The New NP and  the  ANC  had  several  discussions  about  this  Bill  that
resulted in amendments which were  accepted  and  discussed  by  the  select
committee, and which made the Act acceptable. These amendments  ensure  that
the Act is aimed only at restitution claims; and that the suspicion  created
by the DA, that this includes general land reform,  is  removed.  They  also
provide that portions of a farm that may be uneconomical  or  useless  after
an appropriation  may  be  included  in  the  appropriation.  The  landowner
therefore does not have to be saddled with it. In accordance  with  the  ANC
and the New NP the appropriations are also  subject  to  the  Administrative
Justice Act, which the hon member Versveld has obviously not read yet.

The Minister may not act arbitrarily,  because  the  administrative  process
will always be subject to judicial oversight.  The  amount  of  compensation
can also be settled by a court. Why then this Act? the  hon  Versveld  wants
to know. So that the DA could abuse it and hurt the feelings of  people  out
there. That is  what  they  did  with  it.  But  the  real  reason  is:  The
Constitution says that there must be such an Act. Section 25(2) - go and  do
some reading if you can - provides that appropriations can only  take  place
by means of a general Act, and here we have the general Act. It  would  help
if  the  hon  Versveld  would  not  act  like  a  real  fish-wife  here  ...
[Laughter.]

The department furthermore undertook to include two provisions in the  Guide
to Restitution, namely to  prevent  land-neglect  requirements  taking  them
over, and that the  state  must  ensure  that  the  claimant  is  adequately
empowered to continue with the farming. This Act will  only  be  used  as  a
last resort when no agreement can  be  reached  on  price.  The  process  of
determining whether a claim is valid and representations that  can  be  made
for it remain exactly the same. However, the New NP is  not  convinced  that
this  Act  is  the  magic  wand  that  will  accelerate  restitution  in   a
significant way.

The department should rather see to it that the machinery  of  Land  Affairs
and the  commissioners  function  optimally  and  that  adequate  funds  are
available. An adequate monitoring  system  to  determine  progress  and  co-
ordination is  also  still  lacking.  That  is  what  the  Bill  deals  with
essentially, but the DA and the Freedom Front with their right-wing  farming
arm, the Transvaal Agricultural Union, says: that the  Minister  is  evading
Parliament with this Bill. Evading! But here we are standing in  Parliament.
It is the DA that is ignoring Parliament. In the portfolio committee the  DA
made a racket, but did not propose one amendment. After the  debate  in  the
National Assembly the DA is ignoring Parliament's higher  House  and  saying
that they are going to request the President not to promulgate the Act.  How
ridiculous! In the select committee the DA did not say a word. Did not  even
raise their voices. Did not try to improve the Act. Only voted  against  it,
threatening that the DA would give its reasons here in this debate.]

And we have listened. We have listened to her master's voice. [Laughter.]

Die genoemde DA-koalisie van wanhoop en  verwarring  gebruik  die  media  om
kiesers se emosies op te sweep en nie die probleem aan te  spreek  nie.  Die
DA is in eie geledere ook verward. Die  agb  Dan  Maluleke,  DA-woordvoerder
oor Grondsake, lewer 'n pleidooi  dat  restitusie-eise  heropen  moet  word,
maar die agb Andries Botha, DA-woordvoerder vir Landbou, sÃª  dit  is  sommer
net Maluleke se eie siening.

Die IVP stem ook nie saam met die DA of  die  Vryheidsfront  plus  minus  sy
bedmaats  oor  hierdie  wet  nie.   Daar   word   gepraat   van   grondroof,
oorlogverklaring van Zimbabwe, 'n Zimbabwe aanslag op die grondreg  van  die
individu. Dit is tyd dat die DA en sy regse trawante afsien van  obstruksie-
en versetpolitiek om slegs 'n paar verwarde kiesers te wen.  Die  DA  en  sy
regse trawante se benadering van verwar en regeer, is oneerlik  en  kan  lei
tot polarisasie en dit sal die bloedbad  aanhits  wat  in  die  negentigjare
afgeweer is. En dit mag nie - ons het genoeg daarvan gehad.

Om uitspraak in die hoofstroom politiek te hÃª, is om deel van oplossings  te
wees. Om DA te wees, is om geÃ¯soleerd en gepolariseerd te  wees.  Anders  as
die DA wat sÃª, ``What is bad for South Africa, is good for the DA'', sÃª  die
Nuwe NP: ``What is good for South Africa, is good for all  in  South  Africa
and for Africa.'' (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The said DA coalition of despair and confusion uses  the  media  to  incite
voters' emotions and not to address the problem. There is also confusion  in
the DA's own ranks. The hon Dan Maluleke,  DA  spokesman  on  Land  Affairs,
asks for restitution claims to be reopened, but the hon  Andries  Botha,  DA
spokesman for Agriculture, says that that is merely Maluleke's own opinion.

The IFP also does not agree with the DA or the Freedom Front plus minus  its
bedmates about this Act. Mention is made of  land  robbery,  declaration  of
war of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe's onslaught on the land rights of the  individual.
It is time that the DA and its right-wing henchmen  let  go  of  obstruction
and opposition politics merely to win over a few  confused  voters.  The  DA
and its henchmen's approach of confuse and rule is dishonest  and  can  lead
to polarisation, and that will encourage the bloodbath that was  avoided  in
the nineties. And that cannot be - we have had enough of that.

To have a say in the mainstream of politics is to be part of  the  solution.
To be DA is to be isolated and polarised. Unlike the DA which  says,  ``What
is bad for South Africa, is good for the DA'', the New NP  says:  ``What  is
good for South Africa, is good for all in South Africa and for Africa.'']

Let's make restitution and land reform work for  all  in  South  Africa.  We
support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOÐL: Chairperson, Chief Makhoba of Kokstad said:


  The fact that  we  have  now  got  10  000  hectares  of  our  land  back
  demonstrates the seriousness  of  this  Government  about  reversing  the
  humiliating effects of forced removals.

If you hear a chief leading a tribe of  thousands  of  people  saying  these
words, it confirms that the tide  has  turned.  We  are  saying  that  these
amendments, few may they be in terms of pages, have far-reaching  powers  in
terms of enabling  this  Government  to  move  forward  and  accelerate  the
restitution of land back to the real owners.

It is just disturbing to hear the member of the DA, who does  not  regularly
participate in the committee, and in particular with regard  to  this  Bill.
She was given an opportunity to actually specify which  areas  in  the  Bill
the DA or she herself objected to.  This  opportunity  was  not  only  given
once, but three times and she couldn't budge. I understand  that  she  later
whispered to a colleague: ``I didn't  have  anything  to  say,  but  had  to
support the position I was given by my party''. [Interjections.]

This questions the credibility and integrity of some of  the  members  which
are delegated by certain parties to participate in this august House and  on
its committees. We must put forward, in no uncertain terms, the  obstructive
and destructive role which the DA through its representative  plays  in  our
select committee. But, I must say, that if you have nothing  to  object  to,
then of course you can't say anything.

Caesar to Caesar.''] [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, will  you  take  your  seat.
Yes, hon Botha?

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I want to object to the aspersions which have  been
cast on a legitimate member of the committee, and I'm raising an objection.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That's  not  a  point  of  order!  That's  your
objection. What is the point of order?

Ms C BOTHA: The point of order is that there are unsubstantiated  objections
being made against a member.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That's  not  a  point  of  order,  hon  member.
Proceed, hon WindvoÃ«l.

Mr V V Z WINDVOÐL: Chairperson, the fact of the matter is  that  the  DA  is
not playing any progressive role  in  terms  of  assisting  the  process  of
restituting land to its owners.

This is an exercise that does not need 150 000 members of the  police.  It's
not the same as when we were using people to force people  off  their  land.
We are peacefully and orderly, and also by the rule of  law,  taking  people
back to their land. The process is very clear, because what it says is  that
there will be a validation process and  a  verification  process  where  the
real beneficiaries will be the ones that are going back to the land. We  can
say with pride that many affected departments within  Government  have  been
consulted.  Credible  institutions,  legal  institutions,   and   even   the
Constitutional Court were consulted when this Bill  was  being  drafted  and
also tabled in Parliament.

So to say that there are certain elements of unconstitutionality,  I  think,
is something that should wait until we cross that bridge, if ever  there  is
any bridge to cross. It will be of no use to create a bridge where there  is
no river, because we must allow this process to move smoothly  and  we  must
restitute land to the people who were forcibly removed from those areas.
One can say nothing but that we should thank the majority of the  people  of
South Africa who soberly voted for the ANC in 1994 and in 1999 to lead  this
country and to normalise  the  inequitable  situation  which  we  inherited,
because if, by mistake, the PAC had come into power in  a  Government,  some
of the people would have been driven into the sea. [Laughter.]

So we are saying as the ANC that South Africa belongs to all of us. We  know
that some people do like fishing,  but  if  you  are  thrown  into  the  sea
without being able to come back to land you  will  ultimately  die.  We  are
inviting  everyone  as  the  ANC   to   constructively   and   progressively
participate in the process so that we normalise the situation.

We have said, and we are still saying that i-Afrika mayibuye.  [Africa  must
be returned.] The ANC we will not be held down and held to  ransom  by  such
noises, but we will move forward  and  we  support  this  Bill.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you,  Madam
Chair. Let me just say to Mr Piet Matthee as an aside  that  I  counted  the
delegates when we started, and he was late, so he and the other members  who
arrived late were not counted. [Laughter.] But after  I'd  counted  them  in
the beginning I gave my full attention to the  Chairperson.  I  didn't  look
towards the back again. [Interjections.] No, it was not so  serious.  We  do
these things between the Houses.

You know ... No, perhaps I should wait with this bit until the hon  Versfeld
is back, because she needs to ... [Interjections.] Oh, there she is  in  the
back! There's a fundamental misconception with which the DA  is  struggling.
In actual fact, I would really recommend to her  what  Manie  wrote  in  the
Landbouweekblad of last week. I suspect he may be the editor, but  Manie  is
one of the  few  people  in  this  country  who  really  understands  what's
happening here, so really, we must think carefully.

She was talking about the trias politica, the separation of powers, and  she
said that was the central problem.  Unfortunately,  she  doesn't  understand
how it really works, because the power to  expropriate  is  not  a  judicial
function; it's an executive function. It's acknowledged like that  all  over
the world. Why? Because to expropriate is to take a  very  strong  step,  if
you have to do it; but you take the step  of  expropriation  in  the  public
interest, not to create a just decision like a judgement of  a  court  would
be. It's an action which is taken in  the  public  interest  or  for  public
purposes.

Now why is this then an executive function? Because it is a  function  which
a Minister or a body which has been  elected  through  an  election  process
must decide, because that's the whole idea  of  politics;  a  politician  is
supposed to know what is in the public interest because that's  why  he  has
been elected. It's acknowledged all over  the  world.  In  actual  fact,  in
South Africa I only know of the Water  Court  which  as  a  court  also  has
expropriation powers.

Elsewhere, municipalities, provincial departments and organisation  such  as
Eskom and Telkom all have expropriation powers for  relatively  far  smaller
matters than in the case of a major national issue such as  restitution.  So
she's fundamentally wrong. In actual fact, I see that she's now  putting  it
more softly than the hon Delport did in the Other Place when  he  said  that
this was definitely unconstitutional. I hear she's  now  saying  it  may  be
unconstitutional. I dare the DA: Take  this  to  the  Constitutional  Court.
We'll see you there, and you're going to lose a lot of money because  you're
going to lose the case! [Interjections.]

Let me just say this: What we've got here is a strict law. Expropriation  is
a serious business, and we do realise that, but it's also a  very  fair  and
just law that we are passing here. Just go and look at it and read  it,  and
try and understand it. Even if your normal subject is fishing,  go  and  try
and understand what is really stated here. It is meant to bring  in  section
34 of the Constitution. No-one has touched section 34;  we  haven't  touched
it here! [Interjections.] Section 34 is there all the way! If  you  want  to
take an expropriation order, like any administrative act because  it  is  an
executive administrative act to court on review, you're welcome. Section  34
is operative. No one has touched it.

Perhaps  I  should  explain  it  to  the  delegates  in  this  way:  Suppose
Government in this country wants to undertake a big public project  such  as
building a new national road from east to west over  Southern  Africa,  from
Maputo to Walvis Bay; a  big  project  and  a  new  route  that  has  to  be
followed, but you tell the Government: ``Please, Government, when you  build
this road you must work on the principle of willing buyer,  willing  seller.
If you come to a farm and you want to build the road  over  that  farm,  you
must please ask the farmer if he'd be prepared to sell that  piece  of  land
off to you.''

Now you'll get three types of farmers on the route for that road: The  first
one will say he's in a bit of financial  difficulty  and  he's  prepared  to
sell quickly to get rid of this piece of  land  so  that  the  road  can  go
ahead. The second farmer you'll get to will think  this  is  his  chance  to
make money, so he's going to ask three or four times  the  amount  of  money
that the land is really worth,  because  he's  following  the  principle  of
willing buyer, willing seller.

The third farmer is against motorcars in principle.  He  believes  that  the
Good Lord intended us to ride on horseback and not to drive cars, so he  has
a principled objection against roads in any event, and you  wouldn't  get  a
piece of his land; you'd have to go around him. [Laughter.] I tell you,  you
will never be able to build that  road!  Now  we  come  with  a  far  bigger
objective such as restitution, and that's why we need it.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, would the  Deputy  Minister  be  prepared  to
take a question?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Yes.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: I would just like to know with which Bill the Minister  is
busy now, because he's now talking about expropriation for public  use,  and
we're actually here because of the restitution  of  land  and  expropriation
therefor. I would like to know.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  With  great  respect,
Chairperson, now she's getting really ... I wonder what she's going  to  sip
when she goes out there. [Laughter.] It must be  water  which  is  affecting
her so much! [Laughter.] Now the Constitution in section 25 ...

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of order ... [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: We have quite a long programme  before  us,  so
we want to proceed. Yes, hon member?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: I would like the Deputy Minister to explain  what  he  was
suggesting by that remark.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The Deputy Minister suggested that  you  had  a
drink of water when you went outside the chamber. That's what I understood.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: A drink of water? A sip of water?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That is what he said. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  No,  the  point  is
this, if I could answer the hon member  in  this  way:  Section  25  of  the
Constitution says you can  expropriate  in  terms  of  the  law  of  general
application for public purposes or in the public interest. In  actual  fact,
the general Expropriation Act, which is dated - and I must say that  -  must
be brought up to speed with the new Constitution of 1996. It's not,  in  all
respects, in compliance with the new Constitution. So there  is  work  being
done - the general Expropriation Act of 1975 falls under the  Department  of
Public Works, and I know that they're working on it.  But  the  requirements
``for public purposes'' and ``in the public  interest'',  are  provided  via
section 25 of the Constitution. Yes, really, it is. Don't  shake  your  head
about it. [Laughter.] Read it! It is there in the Constitution

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  Deputy  Minister,  would  you  please
address the Chair? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Oh,  I  am  sorry,
Madam. My apologies. Chairperson, what we have here  is,  as  I've  said,  a
strict matter, because all law is in a certain sense strict,  but  fair  and
just. The amendments, and I must thank the New NP for their support of  this
Bill, and especially for bringing in the reference - that's what they  asked
for and it was in the previous draft - to  the  Judicial  Matters  Amendment
Act of 2000, which has been  included.  The  heart  of  the  matter  in  the
proposed section 42E, as inserted by clause 5, is that the  words  that  are
used there are: `` ... who is entitled to restitution ...''.

In other words, there must be, as it is  called  technically,  an  objective
jurisdictional fact. There must be certainty that a person  or  a  group  is
entitled to restitution. Then you can go on  to  an  expropriation  in  this
respect. [Interjections.]

The other situation, which I think Mr Van Niekerk also referred to, is  that
one  must  think  economically  and  agriculturally   when   one   makes   a
restitution. You'll often have a situation  in  which  50  people  had  been
removed forcibly from a particular piece of land.  Now  their  children  and
grandchildren have a right to restitution, but by  this  time  they  may  be
1Â 000 or 1Â 500 people. To  get  them  back  on  that  piece  of  land  would
sometimes not be an economical proposition. That is  acknowledged  all  over
the world. You must be able  to  expropriate  other  land  which  stands  in
relation to this specific  claim,  as  is  now  very  definitely  stated  in
subsection (1)(b) of the proposed section 42E.

For example, you get it in American law. There's a lot of famous cases.  For
example, there was one in which a slum had to be cleared, I presume  in  New
York,  so  the  legislation   gave   the   power   to   expropriate   slums.
[Interjections.] No, no ... [Interjections.] Just  ignore  her!  [Laughter.]
When they exercised this power to expropriate for the  slum  clearance  they
saw that they couldn't rehabilitate it in an economical way if  they  didn't
expropriate an area next to it as well, but which was not  a  slum.  So  the
American court said: ``No, that is reasonable and just that that  area  next
to the slum, to make it a real rehabilitation of  this  area,  can  also  be
expropriated''. [Interjections.]

And that is exactly  what  we're  now  doing  in  this  amendment.  To  make
economic and agricultural sense, you must ensure that the whole  restitution
should  be  seen  as  a  project  also  for  socioeconomic  purposes.  [Time
expired.]

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

                       SECTIONAL TITLES AMENDMENT BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Dr E A CONROY:  Agb  Voorsitter,  Adjunkminister,  Minister  van  Arbeid  en
kollegas, te oordeel aan die werkswinkels en seminare  asook  nuusbriewe  en
weeklikse rubrieke oor deeltitelaangeleenthede op die  Internet  en  in  die
belangriker nuusblaaie, is dit duidelik dat openbare belangstelling oor  diÃ©
onderwerp al hoe meer prominent op die voorgrond begin tree.

Hierdie  neiging  is  heeltemal  verstaanbaar  indien  die  statistiek   oor
deeltiteleienaarskap in ag geneem word. Die  waarde  van  deeltiteloordragte
oor die afgelope ses jaar het byvoorbeeld van R6,6 miljard in  1997  tot  'n
verstommende R51,4 miljard in 2002 toegeneem. DiÃ© waardes het oor  die  jare
1997 tot 2002 redelik konstant gegroei van die reeds genoemde  R6,6  miljard
tot  R14  miljard  in  2001,  en  diÃ©  viervoudige  sprong   verlede   jaar.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Deputy Minister,  Minister  of  Labour  and
colleagues, judging by the workshops and seminars  as  well  as  newsletters
and weekly articles on matters relating to sectional title on  the  Internet
and in the more important newspapers it is clear  that  public  interest  in
this subject is beginning to step more prominently into the foreground.

This trend is understandable if the statistics on sectional title  ownership
is taken into consideration. The value of  sectional  title  transfers  over
the past six years, for example, increased from R6,6 billion in 1997  to  an
astounding R51,2 billion in 2002. These values grew reasonably  consistently
between 1997 to 2002 from the aforementioned R6,6 billion to R14 billion  in
2001, and then this fourfold jump during last year.]

Chairperson, sectional  titles  already  contain  the  basic  mechanisms  to
nurture  the  growth  of  individual  home-ownership.  The   importance   of
sectional titles for sound urban development and as an urban housing  format
cannot be underestimated and it will  become  even  more  important  in  the
decades ahead. And, with that growing number and importance,  the  need  for
suitable  management  tools  also  grows  and  becomes   considerably   more
complicated.

There  are  therefore  still  challenges  of  compelling  importance  to  be
addressed which relate to the suitability of the legislation in our  African
environment and it is  generally  accepted  that,  with  such  a  phenomenal
growth in sectional title ownership, sophisticated legislation should be  in
place and needs to keep pace with new developments and requirements.

It is for that reason, that not only in this House, but also widely  in  the
sectional title fraternity, further amendments to  the  existing  Acts  were
and still are propagated. The  Bill  under  discussion  today  is  therefore
widely appreciated and any criticism that might be  voiced  against  certain
aspects of it should be seen as constructive. This process  of  renewal,  so
to speak, does not end with these amendments but it is understood  from  the
Department of  Land  Affairs  that  the  legislation  will  undergo  further
adjustments  and  amendments  as  more  controversial  issues  crop  up   in
practice.

The announcement by the  hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Land  Affairs  that  the
possibility and  practicality  of  the  appointment  of  a  sectional  title
ombudsman, a matter which was mentioned in  various  speeches  and  was  the
subject of  various  questions  in  this  House,  is  being  studied  by  an
interdepartmental committee, is welcomed. According to the Deputy  Minister,
the exploratory research conducted by this committee  in  consultation  with
the stakeholders, also in foreign  jurisdictions,  will  look  into  matters
like self-regulation, co-regulation,  the  formation  of  special  sectional
title courts or tribunals and, of  course,  the  formation  of  a  sectional
title ombudsman or adjudicator. The final stages would be  to  estimate  the
costs involved in the implementation  of  the  recommended  policy  options,
including the financing of an ombudsman.

As far as the present Amendment Bill is concerned, we would like to  comment
as follows: In the  past,  amendments  to  the  Sectional  Titles  Act  have
usually reflected the thinking of  the  persons  and  institutions  involved
with the technical application of the Act, like the  Deeds  Registries,  the
Surveyor General, land surveyors and conveyancers, the  banking  sector  and
bodies representing the interests of developers.

This amendment has, for the  first  time,  demonstrated  a  clear  shift  in
emphasis towards the interests of owners who are,  after  all,  the  largest
and most important group  in  the  sectional  title  environment.  For  this
reason alone, the Bill must  be  commended  and  has  in  fact  been  widely
welcomed by commentators in the industry. The substance  of  the  amendments
deal with important issues and will contribute  towards  the  clarity  of  a
statute which already enjoys international acclaim as a model  of  sectional
title legislation.

It is imperative that the focus remains on the  needs  of  the  home  owner,
that government structures are geared to  participate  in  such  focus,  and
that future  legislative  amendments  be  approached  in  consultation  with
individuals and organisations closely involved with  the  administration  of
the Act in the consumer environment. It is  therefore  imperative  that  the
composition of the Sectional Titles Regulation  Board  should  also  receive
attention  in  future  amendments.  At  present,  the  board   consists   of
representatives of the department,  the  Registrar  of  Deeds,  the  banking
sector, estate agents and  property  developers  while  the  most  important
component, namely the owners of sectional title property themselves, do  not
enjoy any representation at all.

Maybe the time has come for sectional title owners  to  organise  themselves
in a voluntary national association to represent their own interests and  to
make their collective voices heard in the fora where decisions are taken  on
their behalf. If a portion of the industry managed  to  organise  themselves
in the National Association of Managing  Agents,  there  is  no  reason  why
owners cannot do the same. Hopefully some  caring  and  enterprising  owners
will take this bold step.

On behalf of the Select Committee  on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs,  I
request the House to support the Sectional Titles Amendment  Bill,  2003.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

                      SPATIAL DATA INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms B N DLULANE: Hon Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  the
Spatial Data Infrastructure Bill, tabled for our consideration today, is  an
attempt to achieve co-ordination with respect  to  the  gathering,  managing
and dissemination of spatial  data  and  information,  in  order  to  enable
spatial information-driven planning and decision-making.

Cognisance  should  be  taken  of  the  fact  that  the   national   spatial
information framework will facilitate the determination of  a  policy  which
promotes  access  to  existing  spatial  or  geographic   information,   the
integration of such information from diverse sources and the reuse  of  such
information.

The objective of the Bill, amongst other  things,  is  to  provide  for  the
establishment of the South  African  Spatial  Data  Infrastructure  for  the
regulation of  the  collection,  management,  maintenance,  integration  and
distribution of spatial or geographic information, amongst other things.  As
in all situations of  this  nature,  provision  is  made  that  the  state's
information resources be used effectively  and  efficiently  and  that  they
also be shared as required and expected.

As enshrined in  our  Constitution,  the  Bill  also  gives  effect  to  the
constitutional right of access to information held by the state, as well  as
that held by other persons, when needed, for the exercise or  protection  of
rights.  The  importance  of   this   piece   of   legislation   cannot   be
overemphasised as globally it is realised  that  spatial  information  forms
part of the infrastructure  needed  to  further  development.  Spatial  data
infrastructure refers to the  technology,  policies,  standards,  and  human
resources necessary to acquire, process, store, distribute and  improve  the
utilisation of geospatial data.

In conclusion, this Bill is well  supported  by  all  structures  that  were
consulted and is also an important piece of legislation in our  country,  as
correctly alluded to in the above. I thank you. [Applause.]

                 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE AGENTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  I  now  call  the
chairperson of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental  Affairs,  the
Rev Moatshe.

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, Ministers,  hon  members,  the  Bill  before  us
today seeks to regulate  the  profession  of  fresh  produce  and  livestock
agents so as to render them independent from  control  by  any  institution,
inclusive of our Government.  Therefore,  the  profession  is  to  be  self-
governing and will not rely on Government funding or any  other  institution
for that matter.

The Amending Bill is aimed at correcting practical deficiencies  which  have
surfaced with the passing of time and are now no longer  applicable  due  to
change in time and trends within the sector they  belong  to;  and  also  to
accommodate present-day concepts such as good corporate governance.

The objectives of this amendment are mainly to  reconstitute  the  governing
body  or  the  agents  council  and  to  facilitate  Government  policy   on
representivity, as well as to enhance good corporate governance. The  Select
Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs requests this House  to  support
this Bill. I thank you.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                       SPECIAL PENSIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr H T SOGONI: Deputy  Chairperson,  the  Minister  present  today  and  hon
members, please allow me on behalf of the Select  Committee  on  Finance  to
present the following statement on  the  Government  Employees  Pension  Law
Amendment Bill. May I also request hon members to give their support to  and
vote in favour of the Bill.

The Bill amends the Government Employees Pension Law of 1996 to provide  for
the recognition of service rendered in  a  nonstatutory  military  force  or
service. At  the  World  Trade  Centre,  political  parties  agreed  on  the
integration of the nonstatutory forces, that is the armies belonging to  the
liberation movements such  as  uMkhonto  weSizwe  or  the  Azanian  Peoples'
Liberation Army, and the statutory forces, namely the SA Defence  Force  and
the defence forces belonging to the TBVC states.  The  interim  Constitution
of 1993 provided for such an integration ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, hon member,  you  are  speaking
on the Government Employees Pension Law Amendment Bill?

Mr H T SOGONI: Yes, Sir.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  We  are  actually  considering  the
Special Pensions Amendment Bill.

Mr H T SOGONI: No, that's not it.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes. So, you will  be  speaking  later
on.
Thank you, hon members. As there is no speakers' list, I shall now  put  the
question.

Order disposed of without notice.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

               GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES PENSION LAW AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr H T SOGONI: Thank you, Chairperson.  Hon  members,  please  allow  me  on
behalf  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  to  present  the  following
statement on the Government Employees Pension  Law  Amendment  Bill.  May  I
also request hon members to give their support to and vote in favour of  the
Bill.

The Bill amends the Government Employees Pension Law of 1996 to provide  for
the recognition of service rendered in  a  nonstatutory  military  force  or
service.

At the World Trade Centre, political parties agreed on  the  integration  of
nonstatutory  forces,  that  is  the  armies  belonging  to  the  liberation
movements, such as uMkhonto  weSizwe  or  the  Azanian  Peoples'  Liberation
Army, and the statutory forces, namely the SA Defence Force and the  defence
forces belonging to the TBVC states.

The interim Constitution of 1993 provided  for  such  an  integration.  Item
24(1) of Schedule 6 of  the  final  Constitution,  Act  108  of  1996,  also
provided  for  the  continuation  of  the  programme  of   integrating   the
aforementioned statutory and nonstatutory forces.

In 1998, at the Public Service Co-ordinating Bargaining  Council  the  state
as the employer agreed with  the  trade  unions  representing  employees  to
improve salaries and other  conditions  of  service  for  employees  in  the
Public Service. This agreement is contained in Resolution 7 of 1998  of  the
PSCBC. The parties at the bargaining council agreed that:


  The Government Employees Pension  Fund  shall  increase  the  pensionable
  years of service or implement other measures for employees  disadvantaged
  by past racial and gender discrimination related to pensions.

The former members of  the  nonstatutory  forces  were  at  a  disadvantage,
compared to the ex-members of the statutory  forces,  as  they  had  had  no
opportunity previously to be members of  the  Government  Employees  Pension
Fund and its contributors. The result is,  of  course,  disparity  regarding
the recognised period of pensionable service.

The consequence of this recognition is  that  members  of  the  nonstatutory
forces qualify to apply to the Government Employees  Pension  Fund  to  have
their service in the nonstatutory forces recognised as pensionable  service.
Pension benefits  of  the  former  nonstatutory  members  who  already  have
benefits in terms of the Special Pensions Act, Act  69  of  1996,  shall  be
reduced  accordingly.  The  Bill  therefore  seeks  to  redress   the   past
imbalances and to put the former members of the  nonstatutory  forces  on  a
par with the ex-statutory forces.

An amount of about R1,5Â billion has been set aside to  meet  the  objectives
of the Bill and  over  R500Â million  has  been  set  aside  to  finance  the
employer's contribution; and affected members  are  also  expected  to  meet
their share of the costs.

The select committee is satisfied that a thorough and complete  process  was
followed to negotiate  a  favourable  or  better  deal  that  should  fairly
benefit all the categories of the former nonstatutory force members.

During the briefing and discussion on the Bill,  the  select  committee  was
also made aware of further improvements on the  proposed  benefits  for  the
members concerned, as a result of earlier proposals and discussions  in  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance.

The select committee is also  satisfied  that  sufficient  consultation  was
made, especially with the former nonstatutory forces who are represented  on
the defence council. Once more, I request hon members to support  the  Bill.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                      SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

UMPHATHISWA WEZABASEBENZI: Mhlalingaphambili,  mandiqale  ngokulungisa  lowo
ubesenza umgaqo-nkqubo walapha. Andinguye uMdladla; zange ndibe  nguye.  Oko
ndaba  nguMdladlana,  mhla  ndazalwa  yintombi  yaseMaBheleni   kwaTsengiwe.
[Uwelewele.] Ndiyacela ke  torho  kungabe  kuphinde  kuthiwe  ndinguMdladla.
Ndiyicela loo nto ndibhekisa kuwe,  Mhlalingaphambili.  Noko  indikhathazile
into yokwenziwa uMdladla. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)
[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, let me first correct  the  person  who
prepared this policy. I would like to make the point that I am not  Mdladla.
I have never been him. I have always been Mdladlana ever  since  my  mother,
Miss  Tsengiwe,  the  daughter  of  the  amaBhele,   gave   birth   to   me.
[Interjections.] I would like to plead with people not to call  me  Mdladla.
I am asking that with due respect, hon Chairperson. I do not  like  that  at
all.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Mhlonishwa,  ngingathi   njena   sixolisa
kakhulu. Kusho ukuthi kube yiphutha, njengezidalwa  zikaThixo.  [Honourable,
I would like to apologise. It was a mistake; as God's creatures.]

The  MINISTER  OF  LABOUR:  Hayi,   ngiyabonga,   Sihlalo.   Malungu   eNdlu
ahloniphekileyo, kuluvuyo kum ukufumana eli thuba lokuthi  thaca  kule  Ndlu
lo Mthetho  uYilwayo  wokuphuhlisa  izakhono  zabantu  esithe  sawuxabangela
ngokuncothula  nokususa  iziphene   ezithile,   ukusinika   amandla   okuthi
siqinisekise  ukuphuhliswa  kwezakhono  zabantu  ngaphandle   kwamakhwiniba.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Thank you, Chairperson. Honourable Members of the House, it is  a  pleasure
to be granted this opportunity to present  this  Bill  here,  a  Bill  whose
objective is skills development and which also has  been  amended  where  it
was necessary and which has so much empowered us  that  we  can  now  ensure
that people's skills are developed without hassles.]

In the five years that have passed  since  this  law  come  into  operation,
literally millions of people have been trained under  its  banner.  Many  of
these people have been the workers who keep our economy running in  all  the
mines, offices, shops, factories and our homes. With the training they  have
received, we believe that the  productivity  and  competitiveness  of  their
workplaces have been improved, as well as their own employment security  and
prospects.

In addition, hundreds of thousands  of  unemployed  people  have  also  been
trained - young and old - to find work  in  the  formal  labour  market,  to
create their own  income-generating  opportunities,  or  to  participate  in
social  development  projects  that  aim  to  improve  the  lives  of  their
communities and the households that constitute them. The  skills  revolution
that the legislation was intended to unleash is,  indeed,  well  under  way.
The amendments set out to remedy the challenges that have had  to  be  faced
in the process of implementation.

Whilst many of the achievements that I have just alluded to are the  product
of the hard work on the part of many of the Sector  Education  and  Training
Authorities, or Setas as they are called, it is a matter  of  public  record
that some of the Setas have not worked  well.  Allies  and  opponents  alike
have forcefully brought the problems  to  the  public's  attention,  because
they are concerned to see every cent collected under  the  skills  levy  for
training delivery being spent properly,  and  certainly  not  wastefully  or
fraudulently. I agree completely with this view.
It has been patently painful for me to watch incidents of poor  performance,
inadequate accountability and, in some instances, financial impropriety.  In
a country where the rule of law reigns supreme, I can only  exercise  powers
which have been conferred on me by law. The current law does  not  allow  me
to adequately intervene and address matters that many of you have  correctly
complained about in relation to the operation of Setas.

My first response was to highlight  this  problem  to  our  social  partners
whose representatives sit on the governing boards  of  these  Setas.  I  was
thrilled when the social  partners  accepted  the  challenge  and  made  the
commitments they did at the Growth and Development Summit.

You will remember that both business and labour said that they would  ensure
that their representatives on the Seta boards were at a sufficiently  senior
level to take meaningful decisions  and  provide  strategic  direction,  and
that  they  would  ensure  that  they  were  adequately  prepared  for  this
responsibility. Hopefully in the future they  will  stand  to  account  when
problems arise. I will not have to take the  heat  alone,  as  is  currently
happening - not that I am scared of the heat. After all, I  do  not  sit  on
the board of any Seta.

However, I must accept that  ensuring  that  the  Skills  Development  Act's
purposes are achieved is my responsibility. And,  in  summary,  the  central
reason for the amendments is to give me the right to fix the  problems  that
have arisen so that the skills revolution can accelerate at a  pace  without
being drawn back by the negative publicity that the bad apples attract.

When considering the changes to the law, I had a choice. I could attempt  to
remedy  each  and  every  problem  as  it  arose,  or  I  could  clarify  my
expectations of good, efficient performance and transformatory practice  for
all Setas and then put in place procedures to target those who deviate  from
this. I have chosen the latter course. I felt that the former  course  would
lead to an ad hoc set of prescriptions, which would  increasingly  skew  the
playing  field  in  ways  that  would  eventually  undermine  the  universal
training agenda we are trying to put in place.

So you will see in these amendments a new obligation on all Setas  to  enter
service-level agreements with the Department of Labour that clearly set  out
performance outcomes and very clear steps should any Seta fail to  meet  its
obligations in terms of these agreements. For  example,  I  shall  have  the
power to instruct Setas to remedy a problem and if they fail to do so,  then
this  would  itself  constitute  grounds   for   the   takeover   of   their
administration.

Some feel, I know, that giving me the power to set salaries  for  staff  and
allowances for  board  members  is  going  too  far.  That  is  the  board's
responsibility, they say. But, again let me  say  that  the  need  for  this
intervention arose in response to the public outcry about these matters  and
where the social partners' representatives  on  Seta  boards,  who  had  the
authority to set reasonable standards in this regard from March  2000,  have
failed to do so.
However, those who are concerned that I  will  exercise  this  power  in  an
arbitrary way that interferes with the performance of Setas need not  worry.
It is precisely in order to promote Seta performance that I  am  introducing
these measure, and so a fair balance will be found,  following  a  fair  and
transparent process.

There are other changes  to  the  Skills  Development  Act  that  have  been
occasioned  by  other  implementation  problems.  In   regard   to   private
employment agencies, for example, there are those of you in this  House  who
will recall the case that was highlighted in the media last year   in  which
it was found that young women were being recruited by unscrupulous  private-
employment agencies from the rural areas with the promise of  domestic  work
here in Cape Town. They were ferried to town in taxis that they  were  later
expected to pay for, kept in barrack-like conditions and then hired  out  at
extremely low rates of pay. Most of the agencies engaged  in  this  practice
were not registered with the Department of Labour, but  ambiguities  in  the
legislation made it unnecessarily difficult to close them down.

The proposed amendments put the matter beyond doubt.  All  private  agencies
will be expected to be registered, and  will  only  be  registered  if  they
comply with decent work practices. Their failure to do so  will  undoubtedly
lead to their closure. I  salute  those  in  the  private-sector  employment
agency  industry  who  have  supported  this  measure,  demonstrating  their
commitment to cleaning up this industry.

Not all the amendments are aimed at solving negative problems.  However,  in
the interests of time I will just  highlight  one  positive  measure.  These
amendments are introducing the employment and skills  development  agencies,
as  I've  already  indicated.  These  agencies  are  going  to  assist   and
accelerate the uptake of  learners  in  learnerships  by  taking  away  from
smaller employers and even  nongovernmental  agencies  all  the  hassles  of
administering learnerships. There will be no reason  for  any  firm  not  to
take on learners after this amendment. They've always been complaining  that
there is an administrative battle  involved.  Now  we  are  establishing  an
Employment  and  Skills  Development  Agency  in  order  to  overcome  those
problems.

Indeed, I support the call of  the  National  Youth  Commission  that  every
single employer has at least one learner. Only on  this  scale  will  we  be
able to achieve both our growth and development target  of  72Â 000  learners
by May 2004 and the National Skills Development Strategy  target  of  80Â 000
by March 2005.

There are other amendments of a technical nature that bring  this  piece  of
legislation in line with the Public Finance Management Act and  provide  for
the funding of the administration of the National Skills Fund from  its  own
resources. I trust that hon members who are committed to the  objectives  of
the skills revolution will support these proposed  amendments  and  also  do
their bit within their spheres  of  influence  to  ensure  that  our  skills
revolution becomes a resounding success. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, as we report  on
the progress made in implementing the Skills Development Act, we  must  also
say that much work has been done and  many  significant  strides  have  been
taken to undo the injustices of the past. The amendments  contained  in  the
Bill seek to respond to policy shortfalls, and, amongst other things,  their
purpose  is  to  ensure  that  the  Minister   has   power   regarding   the
administration and regulation of the Setas.

These  policy  shortfalls  have  precluded  the  Minister  from  making  the
necessary and strategic interventions regarding the failure of the Setas  to
act in  accordance  with  the  contract  and  the  contents  of  the  Skills
Development Act.  Surely  the  proposed  amendments  will  ensure  that  the
Minister is given powers to ensure efficiency regarding  the  implementation
of the Skills Development Act. It is our conviction that, upon  adoption  of
these amendments,  issues  that  were  not  covered  by  this  Act  will  be
addressed.

This Government inherited a  society  that  was  characterised  by  poverty,
unemployment and unskilled labour.  There  are  efforts  and  programmes  in
place that are meant to develop the skills at the  previously  disadvantaged
communities  and  groups  in  order  to  ensure   that   they   meaningfully
participate in and contribute to the economic development of our country.

Last week I attended a skills development strategy conference  at  Gallagher
Estate in Johannesburg. I saw and heard how people are being  equipped  with
skills and how they are being empowered. Allow me to say that  I  anticipate
a situation in which towards the end of the next decade, which we are  about
to enter, we as South Africans will enter  the  global  market  and  compete
successfully as a result of the programmes that are being put in place.  Our
community will be in a position to respond to challenges  such  as  poverty,
job creation opportunities and the  globalisation  challenges  that  I  have
already alluded to.

Amongst other things, these amendments are  aimed  at  ensuring  the  proper
functioning and effectiveness of the  Sector  Education  Training  Authority
and institutions such as the Umsobomvu Fund by ensuring  that  they  respond
to poverty alleviation and to human resources development needs.

Allow me to direct my input to the hon Minister. We would like to thank  the
hon Minister sincerely for the manner in which  he  intervened  in  the  ZZ2
farm issue, where farmworkers were arbitrarily fired. They  have  now  taken
back their respective jobs. Hon Minister, we thank you for the efforts  that
you made in doing that. Thank you. [Applause.]

Me C BOTHA: Agb  Voorsitter,  daar  is  25  van  die  sogenaamde  Setas,  of
sektorale outoriteite, om opleiding en onderwys te  verskaf  aan  spesifieke
sektore van die ekonomie. Hul rol is om vir elke  sektor  vaardigheidsplanne
te ontwikkel, tendense in die sektor te beskryf en die  vaardighede  wat  in
aanvraag is  te  identifiseer  en  dan  te  prioritiseer.  Daarna  is  hulle
veronderstel om planne  te  implementeer,  kwalifikasies  by  die  Nasionale
Kwalifikasie Raamwerk te registreer, opleidingsinstansies te akkrediteer  en
aan die Minister verslag te doen.

Niemand argumenteer oor die  noodsaaklikheid  om  die  vaardigheidsvlak  van
Suid-Afrikaners te verbeter nie. Juis ons  gebrek  aan  vaardighede  lÃª  ten
grondslag aan die hoÃ« vlak van werkloosheid wat  ons  ondervind,  en  daarom
moet  ons  alles  moontlik  doen  om  hierdie  onreg   ongedaan   te   maak.
Daarbenewens  verander  die  behoeftes  van  die  mark  vinnig,  en   vorige
kwalifikasies voldoen nie noodwendig aan  huidige  markvereistes  nie.  Maar
die bestaande wetgewing het nie verseker dat Setas hulle  aansienlike  bates
op die nodige opleiding bestee nie. Sommige het enorme  somme  geld  in  hul
bankrekenings wat nie aangewend is vir dÃ­t waarvoor dit  bestem  was  nie  -
soos die Minister ook te kenne gegee het.

Miljoene rande, wat kom van werkgewers se verpligte 1%  maandelikse  heffing
op salarisse, lÃª onbenut in sekere Setas se bankrekeninge. Tien persent  van
hierdie fondse  is  veronderstel  om  na  administrasie  te  gaan,  70%  kan
teruggeÃ«is word en 20% is bestem vir die nasionale  vaardigheidsfonds.  Baie
werkgewers beskou egter hul bydrae as nog 'n belasting, en sien nie kans  om
deur die burokratiese prosedure te gaan wat nodig is om die  geld  terug  te
eis nie.

Die wetsontwerp voor die Huis vandag probeer om  van  hierdie  tekortkominge
aan te spreek deur vir die Minister meer magte te gee. Die DA is van  mening
dat hierdie magte eerder by die DG tuishoort.  Daar  word  ook  veranderinge
aangebring om die administrasie van die fonds in  lyn  te  bring  met  ander
statutÃªre fondse en verpligte ekwiteitsvereistes vir  die  bestuur  van  die
personeel van Setas. Die DA is ook nie  oortuig  dat  laasgenoemde  vereiste
die nodige verbetering in die prestasies van Setas teweeg  gaan  bring  nie,
aangesien dit nie  noodwendig  die  bestuur  sal  verbeter  nie.  Ten  spyte
hiervan het sekere Setas ongetwyfeld suksesse  behaal  en  het  2,3  miljoen
werkers verlede jaar aan programme deelgeneem.

Minister, 'n derde van Suid-Afrikaanse werkers is werkloos.  Hulle  het  nie
die vaardighede wat in aanvraag is nie, en daarbenewens  het  ons  'n  hoogs
gereguleerde arbeidsmark wat miljoene werkers effektief uit  die  werk  hou.
Dit is u verantwoordelikheid  om  toe  te  sien  dat  Suid-Afrikaners  beide
opleiding en werkgeleenthede het.  Alle  struikelblokke  moet  uit  die  weg
geruim word. As hierdie wysiging nie help om die Setas effektiewer  te  maak
nie, moet hulle geskrap word en 'n nuwe plan gevind word. Nietemin,  die  DA
steun  die  wysingswetsontwerp.  Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: Hon Chairperson, there are 25  of  these  so-called  Setas,  or
Sector  Education  and  Training  Authorities,  to  provide  education   and
training to specific sectors of the economy. Their  role  is  to  develop  a
skills plan for  each  sector,  describe  the  trends  in  the  sector,  and
identify and prioritise the  skills  that  are  in  demand.  Then  they  are
supposed to implement  the  plans,  register  the  qualifications  with  the
National  Qualifications  Framework,  accredit  training  institutions,  and
report to the Minister.

Nobody  disputes  the  necessity  to  improve  the  skills  level  of  South
Africans. It is precisely our lack of skills  that  is  fundamental  to  the
high unemployment rate we are  experiencing,  and  therefore  we  should  do
everything in our power to undo this injustice. In  addition  to  that,  the
needs of the market change  quickly,  and  previous  qualifications  do  not
necessarily measure up to the current market requirements. But the  existing
legislation did not ensure that Setas spent their substantial assets on  the
necessary training. Some have  enormous  amounts  of  money  in  their  bank
accounts which have not  been  used  for  the  intended  purpose  -  as  the
Minister has also indicated.

Millions of rands from the employers'  compulsory  monthly  levy  of  1%  on
salaries are left unused in the bank accounts of some Setas. Ten percent  of
these funds are supposedly for administration, 70% can be reclaimed and  20%
is set apart for the National Skills Fund. However,  many  employers  regard
their contributions as another form of tax,  and  are  not  prepared  to  go
through the bureaucratic procedure necessary to reclaim the money.

The Bill tabled before the House  today  tries  to  address  some  of  these
shortcomings by giving more powers  to  the  Minister.  The  DA  is  of  the
opinion that these powers should rather be vested in  the  DG.  Changes  are
also being  made  to  align  the  administration  of  the  fund  with  other
statutory funds and compulsory equity requirements for managing  the  Setas'
staff. The DA is also not convinced that the latter requirement  will  bring
about the necessary improvement in the achievements  of  the  Setas,  as  it
will not  necessarily  improve  the  management.  Despite  this  some  Setas
undoubtedly achieved  success,  and  2,3  million  workers  participated  in
programmes last year.

Minister, one third of South African workers are  unemployed.  They  do  not
have the skills which are in demand, and in  addition  to  that  we  have  a
highly regulated labour market that effectively keeps  millions  of  workers
out of jobs. It is your responsibility to see  to  it  that  South  Africans
have both training as well as job opportunities.  All  obstacles  should  be
removed. If this amendment does not help to make Setas  more  effective,  it
should be scrapped and a new plan be found. Nevertheless,  the  DA  supports
the amending Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mnr F ADAMS: Agb Voorsitter, Minister en lede van die Raad, myns insiens  is
hierdie  wetgewing  streng  gesproke  werklik  nodig,   want   werkloosheid,
armoede, HIV/Vigs, geweld en  behuisingsnood  is  steeds  van  die  grootste
faktore wat ons pla in die land.

Ek beoog nie om die Raad se tyd met 'n paar steriele argumente te mors  nie.
Ek wil die Minister en die departement bedank vir 'n wonderlike  wetsontwerp
wat voorberei is. Ek wil graag versoek dat  die  toepassing  daarvan  streng
gedoen word. Die Nuwe NP steun die wetgewing. Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, Minister and members of the Council,  to  my  mind
this  legislation  is,  strictly   speaking,   really   necessary,   because
unemployment, poverty, HIV/Aids,  violence  and  the  housing  shortage  are
still some of the major factors that bother us in this country.

I do not seek to  waste  the  time  of  this  Council  with  a  few  sterile
arguments. I want to thank the Minister and the department for  drafting  an
excellent Bill. I would like to request that it be  strictly  enforced.  The
New NP supports the legislation. I thank you.]

Mnu M J BHENGU: Sihlalo, ngithanda  nje  ukusekela  usihlalo  wami  wekomidi
umama uNkuna kwasekushilo, nokunye nje osekushiwo umhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe.
Cha, siyabona baba, abangaboni ngicabanga ukuthi bancane kunalabo  ababonayo
ukuthi  uyasebenza.  Thina  nje  siyabona  ukuthi  uyasebenza  impela  ngoba
umsebenzi   wama-Seta   lona   sesiwubonile   ezindaweni   eziningi   ukuthi
uyasebenza, futhi-ke uzokwenza ukuthi  le  nto  esiyifunayo  yokuthi  abantu
bacoshe imisebenzi yenzeke ngoba yilokho  baba  engicabanga  ukuthi  yikhona
okuyinkinga.

Ngakho-ke  mhlonishwa  uNggongqoshe  ngikholwa  ukuthi  la  mandla   esizama
ukukunikeza wona  uzowaphatha  ngokukhulu  ukwethembeka  futhi  uwasebenzise
kahle  nasekuqedeni  isihlavana  esesiqala  ukuqhamuka,  salokhu   abakubiza
ngesilungu bathi i-corruption, ukuze  ukwazi  ukukubamba  kusaqhamuka  njena
bese  uyakubulala.  Yikho  lokho  okubuye  kusikhathaze   okwenziwa   abantu
bakithi. Ngakho-ke ngala mandla sithi awuqhubeke lo msebenzi wama-Seta.

Manje kukhona lapho ngiye ngibone khona  ukuthi  iminyango  lena  ihlangene.
Ake  ngenze  isibonelo:  uye  uthole  ukuthi  uMnyango  wezeMpilo  noMnyango
wezokuThuthukiswa  komPhakathi  iyahlangana  bese   yakha   i-Seta   eyodwa.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I would like to support my chairperson  of  the
committee, Mrs Nkuna, in what she has said, and also what has been  said  by
the hon Minister. We do see, hon Minister; I think  those  who  do  not  see
that you are working are fewer than those who can see. We can see  that  you
are working, because we have seen the work of the Setas in progress in  many
places, and you will enable people to get  jobs,  which  is  what  we  want,
because that is what I think is problematic.

Therefore, hon Minister, I believe that you will handle these powers we  are
trying to give you with honesty and put them to good use to put  an  end  to
corruption, which is beginning to show, so that you would be able to  detect
it early and get rid of it. That is what worries  us  sometimes  -  what  is
done by our people. Therefore with these powers  we  say  let  the  work  of
Setas go ahead.

There are instances when I realise that the departments are united.  Let  me
cite an example: You will  find  that  the  Department  of  Health  and  the
Department of Social Development come together and make one Seta.]

Now when it came to the implementation of the  programmes,  you  would  find
that the two departments did not actually work together. I  have  personally
identified that kind of problem. Could the Minister look into  that  because
I think that they actually forget the philosophy behind the creation of  the
Setas?

Ngakho-ke  ngithi  umsebenzi  lona  osuwenzile,  selokhu  kwaqala  ama-Seta,
siyawubonga. Iqembu lami-ke leNkatha  lithi  cha,  liyakuvuma  konke  lokhu.
Siyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Therefore, I say, we are grateful for the work you have  done  since  Setas
have started.  My  party,  the  IFP,  agrees  with  everything.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, the reality of  the  matter  is  that  we  have
inherited a dichotomous and fragmented society from  the  apartheid  system,
which has adversely impacted on human resource  development  needs  and  the
skills level of  this  country.  Amongst  other  things  is  the  fact  that
apartheid education and training were not based on principles of equality  -
and were neither meant to fully develop nor  enhance  the  skills  of  black
employees.  Hence,  the  ANC  Government  had  to   introduce   the   Skills
Development  Act  to  ensure  that  proper  training  is  provided  for  all
employees and that such training is aimed at  ensuring  that  employees  are
given skills, irrespective of their race, colour or gender.

The introduction of the Skills Development Act was meant to ensure that  the
plight of the vast majority of  previously  disadvantaged  groups  would  be
addressed - especially women, and  rural  women,  in  particular,  who  were
faced with a lack of basic skills,  and  basic  education  in  numeracy  and
literacy. It must be highlighted that the  intentions  of  these  amendments
are to respond to matters that arose from the implementation of  the  Skills
Development Act. It is in this context that we, as the  ANC,  fully  support
and agree with the proposed amendments as we believe that they  will  ensure
that there is efficiency  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  Act,  and
proper administration and regulation of the Sector  Education  and  Training
Authorities from the side of the Minister.

The  amendments  contained  herein  attempt   to   correctly   respond   and
contextualise all  issues  relating  to  matters  that  were  identified  as
unclear  and  that  have   the   potential   of   creating   confusion   and
misinterpretation for those directly and indirectly  affected  and  involved
in the implementation process of the Skills Development Act.

It is our conviction, as the ANC, that out of these amendments  there  shall
emerge neither misunderstanding nor lack of clarity  around  the  manner  in
which the Minister has to deal with various  matters  that  arise  from  the
Skills Development Act. Among other things, no  specific  powers  have  been
given to the Minister to set criteria for the payment of the  skills  grants
and there is no policy framework that empowers the Minister to intervene  in
terms of making regulations.

Currently, the Act does not give the Minister powers  to  make  suggestions,
such as mergers, or allow the Minister to revise and change the scope  of  a
Seta. The amendments seek to empower the Minister  to  ensure  that  he  can
change the scope of the Seta for the effectiveness and  realisation  of  the
Skills Development Act.

There are a number of amendments proposed in  this  Bill  that  will  ensure
that the Minister has the power to deal with  the  administration  of  Setas
regarding the course of skills  development,  the  attainment  of  a  skills
development strategy  and  the  human  resource  development  needs  of  our
country.

A number of issues were experienced during  the  implementation  process  of
skills development. Others relate to the  failures  of  the  Setas  to  meet
their contractual obligations and standards as  set  down  in  the  contract
agreement. However, due to the lack of  a  policy  framework  to  guide  the
Minister on the manner in which such problems can be dealt  with,  there  is
little if anything the Minister can do to arrest the  situation.  It  is  in
this context that these amendments are aimed at responding  to  such  policy
shortfalls in order to ensure that there are clear  policy  guidelines  that
will empower the Minister to ensure that he deals with such problems.  These
amendments will also ensure that there is efficiency in all Setas that  deal
with the skills development  plan  and  the  implementation  of  the  Skills
Development Act.

The importance of these amendments contained in this  Bill  should  be  read
and  located  within  the  context  of  broader  social  transformation  for
economic  growth  and  sustainable  development.  This  means  that  if   we
attempted to delink or separate these amendments from the dire need  for  an
improved skills level in South Africa and  the  human  resource  development
needs, we would be making a fundamental mistake. It is in this context  that
these  amendments  would  expedite  the  implementation  process  of  skills
development and ensure that our country meets its strategic  objectives  and
the target that it has set for itself.

It is the conviction of the ANC that  these  amendments  are  necessary  and
important for the skills development of  our  society.  They  also  lay  the
basis upon which to build economic growth and develop more  skilled  workers
for the sustainability of Africa's development.

In conclusion, I sincerely hope that the hon members will be able to  locate
the whole debate in the proper context for the betterment  of  our  society.
Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

UMPHATHISWA   WEZABASEBENZI:    Mhlalingaphambili,    mandibulele    kakhulu
kumalungu, ndiwathembisa ukuba  la  mandla  siwanikwayo  siza  kuwasebenzisa
ngokwale ndlela kubhalwe  ngayo  emthethweni.  Kangangokuba  sele  siwenzile
amalungiselelo.  Siye  sanocwangciso  apha  lokubonakalisa  isimo  sezakhono
kwilizwe lethu. Sibonisa abantu  ukuba  kuphi  na  apho  zinganelanga  khona
izakhono.

Kanti sibuye saqulunqa isikhokelo sabaqeshi kwiinkonzo  zoluntu  ukuze  bazi
ukuba   kufuneka   benze   njani   ukuze   bafikelele   kwiimali   kwanokuba
basebenzisane  njani  na  noogunyaziwe  okanye  ii-Seta.   Sibuye   kwakhona
saqulunqa  nesamashishini  abucala.  Ngelishwa,  andisiphethanga  apha  kum.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, let me thank the hon  members,  and  I
promise them that the powers granted me in terms of this Bill will  be  used
in the manner envisaged in the Bill. We have made arrangements  already.  We
had a skills audit involving the  whole  country.  With  this  we  show  the
people where we have skills shortages.

Furthermore, we have drawn up  a  framework  for  employers  in  the  Public
Service so that they know what to do to access the training  funds  and  how
they can work together with the Setas. We have also drawn  up  one  for  the
private sector. Unfortunately I don't have it with me.]

But, at the same time, we have this report, which  is  a  very  nice  report
that indicates what we have done up to now.

Ngoko ke amandla esiwanikwa yile Ndlu  siya  kuthi  siwasebenzise  ngendlela
eyiyo. [Therefore the  powers  accorded  us  by  this  House  will  be  used
appropriately.]

Let me also thank the DA for recognising that it will not help to scrap  the
labour law; the best way is to follow what the ANC-led Government  is  doing
and encourage its voters to rather vote for the  ANC.  [Interjections.]  I'm
really very happy that they have supported the legislation as  the  DA,  and
that indeed all their members will no longer vote for the  DA  but  for  the
ANC, in appreciation of the work that the ANC has done. What  their  members
will do after the elections in 2004 is to scrap the DA and join the  ANC  in
big numbers.

Ewe kunzima, abantu bakuthi mabayazi loo  nto;  umhlaba  uyenyuka.  Sibulawa
yindlala. Imisebenzi  inqongophele.  Kodwa  ke  loo  nto  ayithi  masibuyele
eYiphutha,   apho   sivela   khona.   Asijiki,   siya    phambili,    nokuba
sekumnyam'entla.  Ivili  lenkululeko  liqengqiwe.  Siyingcamle   inkululeko,
asingekhe  ke  siyiyeke  ithatyathwe  ngoofunz'  eweni,   oovuk'   ayibambe,
oqongqothwane  norhoqotyeni,  sibavumele  bayihluthe.  Siya  kuyikhusela  le
nkululeko nangantoni na esinokuthi sibambelele  kuyo.  Esinye  ke  sezixhobo
kukuqinisekisa ukuba izakhono  zabantu  beli  lizwe  ziyaphuhliswa.  Enkosi,
Mhlalingaphambili.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation   of   isiXhosa   paragraph
follows.)

[Indeed, the going is tough, and our people  should  know  that.  Hunger  is
killing us. Jobs are scarce. However, that does not mean that we  should  go
back to the days of apartheid, which we left  behind.  We  are  not  turning
back, we are moving  forward,  come  what  may.  The  wheel  of  liberty  is
turning. We have tasted freedom, and we will never allow miscreants who  are
good for nothing take it away from us. We shall protect  this  freedom  with
everything we can. One of these weapons is making sure that  the  skills  of
the  people  of  this  country  are  developed.  Thank   you,   Chairperson.

                    UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call the hon chairperson of  the
Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises, Mrs Constance Nkuna.

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, we are moving towards the  end  of  our  first
democratic decade with pride as a result  of  further  gains  that  the  ANC
Government has made in addressing the imbalances of the past and the  plight
of workers in general, including domestic and seasonal.

We agreed to amend the UIF Bill so as to  improve  the  conditions  of  both
domestic and seasonal workers. Workers are certain of their future as it  is
in good hands. Through the imbizos,  conferences  and  workshops  that  have
been run throughout the country, the community  is  aware  that  disparities
and discrepancies inherited from the apartheid regime  are  gradually  being
buried in the quest for fair labour practice.

Despite the adoption of Act 63 of 2001 that sought  to  protect  and  defend
the rights of workers, we noted that the disparities  continued  to  prevail
with regard to seasonal and  domestic  workers,  especially  the  fact  that
these workers did not benefit from the UIF like other workers. We  therefore
proposed that there had to be amendments aimed at ensuring that  no  workers
were prejudiced as a result of the nature and character of their  employment
in terms of being able to access the UIF.

These amendments will not only benefit  seasonal  and  domestic  workers  as
they  are  aimed  at  responding  to  the  challenges  facing  all  workers,
including Government employees. They  are  also  aimed  at  confronting  the
challenges facing state pensioners. These amendments demonstrate  dedication
to and the commitment of the ANC-led Government to creating  an  environment
conducive to effective work and the promotion of fair labour practice.

The other area of amendment is the replacement of the CCMA by  the  National
Appeals Committee. This committee will be decentralised in the provinces  to
ensure that provinces deal with their own  matters  before  they  can  refer
them to the national committee.

Through these proposed amendments, there will be no place  for  those  whose
intention it is to exploit seasonal or domestic workers,  as  these  workers
will be enjoying the same rights as their permanent counterparts.

In conclusion, I hope we all agree that this  Government  has  improved  the
working conditions of workers and that the dust is  now  settling.  Part  of
that dust is at the ZZ2 tomato farm. It is our firm belief that  during  our
second decade we will strive to ensure that the injustices of the  past  are
thrown into the sea. Thank you, hon Chairperson. [Applause.]

                       POSTAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  as  we
present this Bill today I want to remind this House that as  Government  our
task is to change the lives of South Africans for the better and  to  expand
access to what we have called a better life.

We can only truly fulfil these tasks if we recognise that  in  so  doing  we
have to address the needs of the poor, of those who have  been  marginalised
from economic activities and social wellbeing as a result of apartheid,  and
then also to ensure that all others also come into the fold. In this  regard
we have no choice but to continue to push back the frontiers of poverty  and
to pursue our agenda for universal access and basic services.

It is with this in mind that when we took the postal services  Bill  to  the
National Assembly in September, I made  the  following  remarks  and  argued
that in our country where millions of people,  especially  the  historically
disadvantaged,  still  depended  on  postal   services   to   interact   and
communicate, the centrality of the SA Post Office, or  Sapo,  could  not  be
undermined. Thus, the challenges the postal administration face become  real
national issues and they demand that they be treated as such.  Clearly,  our
local conditions, stemming from the  inequalities  and  underdevelopment  of
apartheid dictate that we work hard towards fulfilment of universal  service
obligations and that we declare, in no  uncertain  terms,  that  for  us  as
South African citizens access to a basic postal  service  is  a  fundamental
right and not a privilege. This is an overriding imperative.

It was also against this backdrop  that  as  early  as  1997  a  new  policy
process was initiated for the provision of a universal service.  The  policy
found concrete expression in the Postal Services Act of  1998.  Indeed,  the
legislative framework made it possible for Sapo to increase  service  levels
and to embrace technology in the way  they  deliver  these  services.  Crime
levels at Sapo have also been reduced and this has resulted in higher  staff
morale.

On World Post Day, 9 October 2003,  the  SA  Post  Office,  eager  to  prove
itself in the race for efficiency, challenged itself  to  deliver  a  letter
from a post office in Brits to the Durmail sorting hub in Durban by  way  of
normal channels before a  copy  of  that  selfsame  letter  could  be  hand-
delivered by a group of cyclists making the  journey  by  road.  The  letter
sent through normal postal channels arrived at the Durmail hub at  19h00  on
Saturday, whereas the cyclists only reached their destination  at  11h30  am
on Sunday. Clearly, this demonstrated that the Post Office had not won  just
the race, but also that indeed the way they do their business  is  certainly
much faster than the old way and we congratulated them on that feat.
The editorial of a Pretoria newspaper last week, commenting on  this  event,
said that:


  Although we have had occasion in years past to lambast  the  Post  Office
  for poor service, it is striving continuously to  improve  its  standards
  and it seems slowly but surely to be regaining the status of  a  reliable
  and trustworthy agent.

I think this is very instructive indeed. It is  this  determination  of  the
Post Office to overcome the legacy of  the  past  that  we  are  witnessing.
Also, as it strives for greater efficiency we must  commend  it  and  concur
that indeed the  tide  has  turned  for  the  Post  Office  towards  greater
efficiency and effectiveness in its work, as it expands  its  services  into
areas that have not been previously well-serviced.

The Postal Services Amendment Bill should therefore strengthen the  hand  of
the Post Office so that it can reach  greater  heights.  In  line  with  the
public policy of fulfilling the universal service mandate,  the  licence  to
Sapo was granted with a clear obligation. The obligation was to ensure  that
all citizens of our country have access to  a  basic  letter  service;  that
this service would be reasonably accessible  irrespective  of  the  physical
location of where people or citizens were; that this service would be  at  a
uniform postage rate; that this service would be  at  an  affordable  price;
and that this service is a reliable  service.  It  is  important  that  this
becomes part of the Sapo mandate.

To facilitate an environment for Sapo to accomplish  this  monumental  task,
the institution was given a period of exclusivity to provide services up  to
one kilogram, a provision reviewable every three years. During  this  period
of exclusivity, no other postal operator would be authorised to  operate  in
the reserved area. In other words,  it  was  a  specific  reserved  area  of
exclusivity; it was not a generalised exclusivity. If Sapo is  to  meet  its
obligations to the benefit of millions of our people it  is  important  that
this exclusivity be retained. The introduction of  this  Bill  is  aimed  at
doing exactly that.
The repeal of the  third  section,  which  we're  dealing  with  today  will
protect the exclusivity given to Sapo in respect  of  this  reserved  postal
service. It will also eliminate the  multiplicity  of  interpretations  that
emanated from this section.  The  law  also  requires  the  Post  Office  to
provide an address to all citizens,  because  Government  acknowledges  that
without an address it is impossible for citizens to  participate  fully  and
meaningfully in economic and social activities. At present, the Post  Office
is trying to meet the challenge of having to deal with  a  backlog  of  four
million citizens who do not  have  addresses.  In  this  way  we  bring  the
historically disadvantaged and  the  marginalised  into  the  mainstream  of
postal services in the 21st century. From  the  manner  in  which  the  post
offices are working it is quite clear that the African Renaissance is  truly
upon us.

Sapo is engaged with the Southern African Development  Community,  or  SADC,
in activities to try to improve the infrastructure of  our  region  and  our
neighbours.  These  linkages  are  important  because  they  enable  us   to
strengthen our networks across the continent and to help to  provide  better
and more efficient postal services even beyond our borders.

At a continental and global level, we are active participants in  fora  such
as the Pan-African Postal Union  and  the  Universal  Postal  Union  as  our
agenda is also to work towards a better Africa and a better  world.  Indeed,
the call of the Secretary-General of the Universal Postal Union on  the  eve
of Postal Day was: ``Think globally and act locally.''  It  is  as  part  of
this world community that we should gear ourselves up to make  our  mark  by
doing what is relevant to our own local conditions in  embracing  this  call
and in meeting the universal access mandate that this Bill gives to Sapo.

There is a rural postal strategy in place that is being implemented  through
what is called ``citizens' post  offices''  as  well  as  through  providing
postal  infrastructure  to  multipurpose  community  centres,  or  MPCCs,  a
project that is  being  carried  out  in  partnership  with  the  Government
Communications  and  Information  System,  GCIS.  In  rolling   out   postal
services, we prioritised both the rural nodes that have been  identified  in
Government's Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme as  well  as
in the Urban Renewable Strategy. The  regulator  has  developed  regulations
and a monitoring framework for service delivery, and it is in  this  context
that this Bill should be seen.

In recent weeks much has been  said  about  the  Postal  Services  Amendment
Bill, most of which is unfounded and  which  attempts  to  set  alarm  bells
ringing and to strike fear in the public when there is really nothing to  be
afraid of or concerned about. It has been said, amongst other  things,  that
this Bill is likely to lead to job losses,  the  shutting  down  of  courier
companies and that South  Africa's  ability  to  compete  globally  will  be
inhibited. The view has also been put forward, and I'm not  sure  why,  that
the Bill will also prevent the delivery of pizzas,  flowers,  medicines  and
other miscellaneous items that weigh under 1kg. I've never heard of  pizzas,
flowers or medicines being sent to a postbox in a yard.
I thought these things were not real until I also received  quite  a  number
of letters that actually articulated some  of  these  views;   letters  that
were sent to the Ministers of Trade and Industry and of  Finance.  I'd  like
to read one of the letters that was sent to Mr Manuel  to  show  that  there
has indeed been great hysteria. This is a letter from  a  group  of  people,
addressed to the Minister. It says:


  It is indeed a very sad day  for  the  ANC  to  have  achieved  what  the
  National Party  tried  to  do,  that  is,  put  very  successful  courier
  companies out of  business.  My  staff  countrywide  and  their  extended
  families - note countrywide - have stated that they will not vote ANC  in
  the forthcoming election.

I'm not sure how this gentleman actually knows anything about  the  extended
families of the people he says work for him. But if he had in  fact  advised
these extended families that this Bill  would  now  allow  for  delivery  of
letters right to their doorstep, I wonder whether they would not have  said,
``That is a good reason why we should vote ANC''.

The Bill is quite clear in that it addresses items that can be delivered  to
a postbox, and not all and sundry goods as its  detractors  suggest.  It  is
also obvious that the Postal Services Amendment  Bill  does  not,  in  fact,
prevent courier  companies  from  operating,  but  frees  legally  operating
companies - and  I  mean  legally  operating  companies  -  to  provide  the
services they were doing before. We are not stopping them from  doing  that.
Surely it is this freedom that will enable even more  courier  companies  to
grow and flourish, and it should result in more  sustainable  jobs  in  this
highly competitive sector. In  fact,  this  Bill  will  not  only  encourage
competition in the postal sector, but will clarify the regulatory  framework
for the delivery of universal  service.  Many  people  forget  that  because
there was no clarity, a case had to be decided by the courts.  That  is  why
we needed to actually change this in order to make it quite clear  what  the
law says, because it is not a new thing that we are doing.
Certainly it is through competition that we will lower  prices  and  improve
service level delivery, and, in fact, also, show up the Post  Office  if  it
does not do its work very well. This Bill will also clarify the  competition
landscape; many people say that unless we understand  what  the  competition
landscape is, we cannot come into this business.  So,  this  Bill  clarifies
the competition landscape for this sector and  provides  continuity  in  the
sector, and also allows all operators to focus  on  the  lawful,  harmonious
business of this industry. That is what this Bill is really all  about,  and
not the hysteria that we've been reading about in the media.

I'd like to thank the chairperson and all members of  the  Select  Committee
on Labour and Public Enterprises for  processing  this  Bill.  I'd  like  to
thank them, in fact, for making sure  that  people  can  make  presentations
before them and have this matter clarified if  there  is  any  confusion.  I
think there is conviction out there.  A  doctor  called  me  who  was  quite
concerned because she had to  deliver  medicines.  She  was  very  concerned
about this Bill, and said: ``Aunty, now my  whole  business  goes  down  the
drain.'' I said: ``Do you put the  medicine  in  the  postbox?''  She  said:
``No''. I said: ``Well, then, read the Bill.'' She was quite  relieved.  She
was going to have the bank cancel the agreement they had  on  the  basis  of
this Bill, because even the bank had not read what this  Bill  was  actually
saying. So it does help if members who are representatives in  these  Houses
actually give our people information that does not  scare  them;  that  does
not create unnecessary uncertainties in the industry.

I'd like to thank the committee for having allowed the opportunity for  such
clarity to actually be arrived at. A special thanks goes to  the  Department
of Communications, the Director-General and especially the Deputy  Director-
General of Postal Policy in the department  for  co-ordinating  the  process
that culminated in the presentation of this Bill and for doing a great  deal
to clarify some of these things, especially to the public.

This House, I'm sure, recognises that as Government  we  are  determined  to
meet  the  needs  of  all,  including  the  poor,  and  we  shall  encourage
competitiveness in the postal sector as  a  whole.  We  are  confident  that
through this Bill a basic postal service will become a  living  reality,  as
it is indeed a right of all citizens of our country and thus a  public  good
that cannot be left in the hands of the market.  I  therefore  request  that
this House please accept this Bill. I thank you, Madam. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call the hon chairperson of  the
select committee, Mrs Constance Nkuna.

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, allow me to start by  saying  that  when  this
Bill was presented to us and when some concerns were raised,  we  were  made
to understand that about 500 000 jobs were going to be lost. We tried  as  a
committee and with the department to really find these  500  000  jobs  that
were going to be lost and we couldn't even trace one job.
We are presenting the Postal Services Amendment Bill against the  background
of a deluge of objections and criticism premised on the  principal  argument
that the Bill is likely to lead to the closure  of  thousands  of  small  to
medium-sized courier companies and consequently  will  also  result  in  the
loss of thousands of jobs. Also, accusations abound that the Bill  was  ill-
conceived and processed without consultation. As recently as last night  the
free-to-air  television  channel  carried  extensive  coverage  of   similar
objections by  largely  the  previously  advantaged  groups  and  companies,
expressing the potential ruin the Bill holds for them. Funnily  enough,  the
debate has been reduced to the size of a pizza.

The hon Minister has  already  alluded  to  this.  Those  people  that  were
delivering pizzas will continue to do so.  Blood  samples,  medicine,  spare
parts from this area to that area will continue  to  be  delivered  in  this
way. However, the ANC will within the ambit of our mandate  -  as  given  by
the overwhelming majority of our people, most of whom live in the rural  and
remote  areas  of  our  country  -  and  through  this  Bill,  reaffirm  our
commitment to our people. Over the last nine  years  we  have  succeeded  in
identifying greater numbers of our people  who  are  totally  excluded  from
basic telecommunications infrastructure, let alone an efficient,  affordable
and reliable postal service. This has emphasised the need for us to  respond
in a manner that will ensure our people are able to  communicate,  not  only
with their relatives or friends, but also with us,  the  Government  of  the
day.

We deemed it important to provide this background since the  opposition  has
not once, either in their public attacks or in their written submissions  to
the select committee, acknowledged that this is in fact the status  quo.  As
usual, it has adopted the role of the prophet of doom. In their narrow  view
they have overlooked the fact that what we are providing for  in  this  Bill
is common cause in  European  countries.  We  also  note  with  concern  the
apparent double standards of certain countries with regard to their  holding
companies who are dead set against the  Bill.  For  example,  DHL  which  is
regulated abroad, does not want to be regulated in South Africa.

More disconcerting are the distortions  emanating  from  a  section  of  the
Afrikaans press as well. It conveniently ignores the reality that  thousands
of farmworkers work in far-flung areas and rely exclusively on  farm  owners
for a bumpy ride into town in order to conduct business of this nature.

Dit kan nie meer geduld word nie, sÃª ek. [This can no longer  be  tolerated,
I say.]

We therefore appeal to our farming  community  in  the  rural  areas  to  be
proactive and ensure that together with workers, houses  on  farms  are,  at
best, equipped with postboxes or, alternatively, that the  farming  district
has a communal letter box.

We have repeatedly stated that this Bill does not  introduce  anything  new,
as I said previously. We even tried to search in thin air, thinking that  we
couldn't read the Act properly. But nothing  new  is  being  introduced.  In
fact, it merely strengthens the current  legislation  in  that  a  universal
service was envisaged as early as 1997 when we started the  policy  process.
The objective is merely to align it with the universal  service  mandate  of
the SA Postal Service.

This universal service mandate is an obligation  placed  on  the  SA  Postal
Service to ensure that all South Africans have equal access to basic  postal
services at affordable prices, irrespective of the geographic location.  The
Postal Service has the obligation to establish postal offices  in  the  deep
rural areas, irrespective of whether there is any interest or not.  Research
is showing that courier companies are either loathe  to  or  do  not  render
universal services.

This is another area which is a bone of contention. Furthermore, we  believe
that through the amendment of section 22, courier companies will no  longer,
owing to a loophole in the  principal  Act,  be  able  to  encroach  on  the
reserve area of the SA Postal Service.
Yes, when we  promised  our  people  that  we  would  be  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, we meant to do so.

Xitsonga paragraph follows.)

[I wish to conclude by  saying  that  this  Bill  has  enabled  the  private
companies to open up a large gap; they wish to amend this Act  as  a  whole.
We as the lawmakers want to say that the doors are open, let  them  organise
their suggestions and take them to the department. Then the department  will
bring their suggestions here. We are ready to look at  the  amendments  once
they are there to see whether they are valid.]

In conclusion, our thanks go to the department for  their  co-operation  the
committee deliberations and during the very  strenuous  times  in  which  we
were trying to explain this to people who did not want  to  agree  to  agree
with it. To the committee  members,  you  have  shown  once  more  that  you
practise what you preach. With these words I would like to thank  everybody.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  I  wait  with  bated
breath for the day when the postman on his bicycle with his bag on his  back
arrives at our farmhouse door, 36 kilometres out of town on a dust  road.  I
am really looking forward to that day.

Die wetsontwerp onder bespreking maak voorsiening vir die wysiging  van  die
Wet op Posdienste van 1998 ten  einde  die  SA  Poskantoor  se  eksklusiewe,
oftewel monopolistiese, reg  om  gereserveerde  posdienste  te  verskaf,  te
beskerm.
Die kern van die DA se probleem met die  wetsontwerp  is  nie  diÃ©  bepaling
nie, maar die kwessie dat koeriermaatskappye in hierdie wetgewing  ingesluit
word, en dus net soos die Poskantoor as  posdiensvoorsieners  geklassifiseer
moet word, maar klaarblyklik  uitgesluit  kan  word  van  die  gereserveerde
diens wat items kleiner as een kilogram betref - soos  ek  weer  eens  aflei
uit die voorsitter se toespraak.

Hierdeur word 4 000  tot  5  000  wettige  koeriermaatskappye  se  daaglikse
bedryfsaktiwiteite in geregtelike onsekerheid  gedompel.  Dis  nie  net  die
bestaande maatskappye wat hierdeur  geraak  word  nie,  maar  ook  opkomende
geleenthede  vir  swart  bemagtiging  om  hierdie  miljardrand-industrie  te
betree, kan hierdeur verlore gaan omdat 'n hele industrie  ten  duurste  vir
die Poskantoor gereserveer kan word.

Dit is een van  die  interpretasies  wat  die  huidige  bewoording  van  die
wetgewing moontlik maak. Desondanks die versekering van die departement  dat
dit nie so toegepas sal word nie, is dit nie die departement nie,  maar  die
howe, wat nÃ¡ vandag hierdie beslissing moet maak.

Openbare verhore is nie in die portefeulje komitee gehou  nie.  Volgens  die
ANC was hierdie wetgewing net 'n tegniese amendement, ten  spyte  van,  soos
die Minister ons hier vertel het, al die briewe wat sy ontvang het.  En  dit
is dan ook deur die portefeulje komitee goedgekeur sonder enige  konsultasie
met die koerier- of transportmaatskappye.

Op aandrang van die DA is daar  gereÃ«l,  en  goedgunstiglik  toegestem,  dat
verteenwoordigers van  die  aansienlike  industrie  vertoÃ«  tot  die  Gekose
Komitee kon rig - die dag vÃ³Ã³r die wetsontwerp  geskeduleer  is  om  in  die
Raad gedebatteer te  word.  Gevolglik  het  die  belanghebbendes  se  vertoÃ«
vervaag tot niks meer as 'n ``window dressing"-geleentheid  nie.  Selfs  die
enkele verandering wat oorweeg sou word, naamlik dat  aflewerings  teen  die
volgende werksdag moet geskied, en nie teen eenuur  die  volgende  dag  nie,
het daarmee verlore gegaan.

Die  komitee  en  die  departement  het  'n  totaal  onaanvaarbare   rigting
ingeslaan deur te sÃª: ``Pass the Bill now and clean up later'',  Ã©n  verder,
``Ons deure is altyd oop vir konsultasie vorentoe.'' Is dit nie presies  wat
ons veronderstel is om te doen tydens die bespreking van 'n  wetsontwerp  en
nie daarnÃ¡ nie?

Die voorsitter se verduideliking dat amendemente  dikwels  volg  wanneer  in
die praktyk gevind word dat sekere bepalings nie werkbaar  is  nie,  gee  'n
baie negatiewe beeld van die gehalte van die oorspronklike wetgewing.  Goeie
wette behoort deurdag te wees, geskryf te word deur ervare regslui, te  volg
op indringende konsultasie Ã©n, in die einde,  nie  'n  gerieflike  bron  van
inkomste te verskaf aan prokureurs wat dit moet interpreteer nie.

Almal ondersteun die beginsel dat die Poskantoor ekslusiwiteit behou  om  te
verseker dat posdienste vrylik bekombaar is vir die meeste  Suid-Afrikaners.
Ons argumenteer nie oor die beginsel van die wetgewing  nie,  maar  oor  die
gebrek aan  duidelike  omskrywings,  en  die  vermenging  van  begrippe  wat
wesenlik in verskeie wetgewing tuishoort.

Is koerierdienste deel van die posdiens, of nie? 'n Posdiens is  'n  basiese
diens waar pos by 'n posbus of 'n adres afgelewer word, anders as 'n  pizza.
'n Koerierdiens is  'n  waardetoegevoegde-diens  wat  gelewer  word  aan  'n
persoon, en hierdie verskille behoort deur  ander  wetgewing  gereguleer  te
word.

Die Kompetisie Kommissie - om te praat van 'n  gesaghebbende  groep  -  sien
nie die nodigheid vir regulering en registrasie van die koerierdienste  deur
die Poskantoorwet nie. Volgens hulle behoort  ekonomiese  en  prysregulering
net betrekking te hÃª op dienste wat deur 'n monopolie  soos  die  Poskantoor
gelewer word, en hulle beveel aan dat alle verwysing na ``koerier'' uit  die
wet verwyder word.

Ongelukkig wou  die  ANC  geensins  gehoor  gee  aan  hierdie  gesaghebbende
opinies nie, wat nog van die DA se insette, en bly die  huidige  wetsontwerp
gehul in onsekerheid. Die  DA  kan  nie  hierdie  moontlike  bedreiging  vir
duisende  werkgeleenthede,  beide   in   die   transportindustrie   en   die
koerierdienste goedkeur nie, en ondersteun dan ook nie die wetsontwerp  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Bill  under  discussion  provides  for  the  amendment  of  the  Postal
Services Act of 1998 in order to protect the SA Post Office's exclusive,  or
rather monopolistic, right to provide reserved postal services.

The crux of the DA's problem with the Bill is not this  provision,  but  the
fact  that  courier  companies  are  included  in  this   legislation,   and
therefore, like the Post Office, have to be classified as a  postal  service
providers, but apparently can be excluded from the reserved service  in  the
case of items smaller than one kilogram - as I  have  once  again  concluded
from the chairperson's speech.

In this way the daily activities of 4 000 to 5 000 legal  courier  companies
are plunged into judicial uncertainty. Not only the existing  companies  are
affected by this, but also emerging opportunities for black  empowerment  to
gain access to this billion-rand industry can be lost through  this  because
an entire industry can be reserved at great cost for the Post Office.

This is one of the interpretations made possible by the present  wording  of
the legislation. In spite of the assurance by the department  that  it  will
not be applied in this way, it is not the  department  but  the  courts  who
will have to make this decision after today.

No public hearings were held in the portfolio committee.  According  to  the
ANC this legislation was merely a technical amendment, in spite of,  as  the
Minister told us here, all  the  letters  she  received.  And  it  was  also
approved by the  portfolio  committee  without  any  consultation  with  the
courier or transport companies.

At the insistence of the DA it was arranged,  and  kindly  agreed  to,  that
representatives of the significant industry could  make  representations  to
the Select Committee - the day before the Bill was scheduled to  be  debated
in the Council. Consequently the interested parties'  representations  paled
into nothing more than a  ``window  dressing''  exercise.  Even  the  single
change which would be considered, namely that deliveries should be  made  by
the following working day, and not at one o'clock  the  following  day,  was
therefore lost.

The committee and the department moved in a totally  unacceptable  direction
by saying: ``Pass the Bill now and clean up later'', and furthermore,  ``Our
doors are always open for future  consultations.''  Is  that  not  precisely
what we are supposed  to  do  during  the  discussion  of  a  Bill  and  not
afterwards?

The chairperson's explanation that amendments often follow when it is  found
in practice that certain  provisions  are  not  practicable,  gives  a  very
negative impression  of  the  quality  of  the  original  legislation.  Good
legislation  should  be  well  considered,  written  by  experienced   legal
experts, follow on  incisive  consultation  and,  in  the  end,  should  not
provide a convenient source of income to lawyers who have to interpret it.

Everyone  supports  the  principle  that  the  Post  Office  should   retain
exclusivity to ensure that postal services are  readily  available  to  most
South Africans. We are not arguing about the principle of  the  legislation,
but about the lack of clear definitions, and the mixing  of  concepts  which
essentially belong in various pieces of legislation.

Are courier services part of the postal service or not? A postal service  is
a basic service whereby post is delivered to  a  post  box  or  an  address,
unlike a pizza. A courier service is a value-added  service  rendered  to  a
person, and these differences should be regulated by other legislation.

The Competition Commission - to name an authoritative group - does  not  see
the necessity for regulation and registration of  the  courier  services  by
the Post Office Act. According to them economic and price regulation  should
only apply to services rendered by a monopoly such as the Post  Office,  and
they recommend that any reference to ``courier'' should be removed from  the
Act.

Unfortunately the ANC  would  not  listen  at  all  to  these  authoritative
opinions, let alone the DA's inputs, and the present Bill  remains  shrouded
in uncertainty. The DA cannot approve this possible threat to  thousands  of
job opportunities, both in the transport industry and the courier  services,
and therefore we do not support the Bill.]

Minister, if the Bill is passed here today, my colleague  Vincent  Gore,  on
behalf of the DA, will request the President to use his powers to refer  the
Bill back to the National Assembly for further consultation. I thank you.

Mnu R Z NOGUMLA: Mhlalingaphambili, mandiqale  ngokubhekisa  apha  kwilungu.
Okokuqala, xa lisithi asiyithethi apha, siyithetha kwabo bathi  beze  kuthi,
into yokuba amasango avuliwe  kuye  nabani  na  oxhalatyiswe  ngumba  othile
nonakho ukuza kwikomiti, ilungu elo liyaphosisa.
Okwesibini,  asikhange   sitsho   siyi-ANC   ukuba   lo   Mthetho   uYilwayo
unobucukubhede kwaye awunamiba  ichaphazela  abantu.  Ukuba  kunjalo,  ngaba
igama elithi ``technical'' lithetha enye into.

Kukho imiba apha ekufuneka inikwe ingqwalasela. Andiyazi le  ayithethayo  lo
mfo. Ngoko ke,  Mhlalingaphambili,  zange  khe  kwenziwe  amagqabantshintshi
enkcazelo apha isebe lingakhange linike iinkampani ithuba.  Nazo  iinkampani
ziyayivuma loo nto.

Kwezinye  iimeko  kukungabikho  kwenkathalo  kuzo,   ngokuthi   zingayijongi
inkqubo kwaye zingayi kwiNdlu yoWiso-mthetho  yeSizwe  apho  kwenziwa  khona
amagqabantshintshi enkcazelo  kuqala,  zisuke  zize  apha.  Kodwa  asikhange
sizikhalazele  ngaloo  nto.  Siye  sazimamela.  (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, let me first address the member.  Firstly,  he
says we don't say it here, but we want to say to those who come to  us  that
the doors are open for anyone who is concerned  about  a  particular  matter
that may come before the committee; the member is making a mistake.

Secondly, we as the ANC never said that this Bill  has  no  intricacies  and
aspects that affect  the  people.  If  that  is  the  case,  then  the  word
``technical'' means something else.

There are aspects here that must be given attention.  I  do  not  know  what
this man is saying.  Therefore,  Chairperson,  no  summary  explanation  was
given here without  the  department  giving  the  companies  a  chance.  The
companies also confirm that.

In other situations it is carelessness on their part by failing  to  observe
the  procedure  and  not  visiting  the  National  Assembly,   where   brief
explanations  are  first  given.  They  simply  come  here.  But  we   never
complained to them about that. We listened to them.]

Chairperson, I feel honoured and privileged  to  have  this  opportunity  to
speak and reflect correctly on issues  pertaining  to  the  Postal  Services
Amendment Bill. I hope that everybody in this House will be able  to  locate
this debate and the importance of these amendments  in  the  proper  context
nationally and globally. I believe that it is important  to  note  that  the
committee agreed on the amendments, as  we  all  believed  that  they  would
provide  an  efficient  response  to  the   global   challenges   and   meet
international standards.

In the same  breath,  I  must  highlight  that  there  is  some  misinformed
speculation from the  alarmists  who  suggest  that  these  amendments  will
result in massive job losses. This misconception has  no  basis  whatsoever,
but is aimed,  rather,  at  creating  confusion  for  election  purposes  by
suggesting that this democracy  intends  to  retrench  workers  through  the
Bill. This is done by  the  people  whose  intentions  are  to  mislead  the
public, rather than deal with  reality  and  ensure  that  the  Post  Office
handles its affairs in  a  manner  that  would  enable  it  to  meet  global
standards and respond to global and national challenges.

It has also been raised that the intention of the Bill is to close down  the
private courier companies. Others have gone further to  suggest  that  these
private courier companies would be required to pay exorbitant  amounts  when
applying for licences to operate, and that the Bill is a serious  threat  to
the survival and development of private courier companies.

We must acknowledge that all these  misperceptions  are  aimed  at  creating
confusion and chaos, because they have no basis whatsoever.  The  intentions
of the Bill are aimed at ensuring that we transform the  Postal  Service  in
order that it can respond to the new societal needs and  global  challenges,
and that, amongst other things, post offices expand their  services  to  all
communities, including the poor urban and rural areas.

It is a fact and reality that the majority of  the  rural  areas  never  had
access to basic postal services. The apartheid regime had  no  intention  of
expanding such services to all the citizens of this  country.  Hence,  these
amendments are aimed at expanding and improving postal services.  There  are
many important things that will be achieved with these amendments.

The fundamental objective of these amendments, amongst other things,  is  to
ensure that there is no community that is denied  access  or  is  unable  to
access postal services  owing  to  its  geographical  location.  Surely  the
majority of the rural and previously disadvantaged communities will  be  the
beneficiaries of this process?

We are committed and  determined  to  improving  service  delivery  for  the
betterment of our communities, and to ensuring that we drastically undo  the
imbalances of the apartheid system in which quality services  were  rendered
along racial and class lines. Therefore, let us put an end to the  apartheid
legacy and expedite and expand the basic services to all our people.

It is important to stress the fact that Government has to  ensure  that  the
exclusivity of the SA Postal Service is preserved.  One  of  the  things  we
must do is to understand these amendments in  a  broader  and  international
context as they relate to universal service obligations.

I appreciate the opportunity given to me to convince  this  House  regarding
the reasons the committee agreed on these amendments and to explain them  to
it. The ANC strongly believes  that  they  will  improve  and  expand  basic
postal services to  the  rural  poor  for  improved,  quality  communication
purposes. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, it is very important  that  when
you raise issues, you remain in the House and listen to the response.

Mnr F ADAMS: Voorsitter, dit is maar die DA se styl om te slaan  en  weg  te
hardloop. Hulle is nie bereid om houe  terug  te  vat  nie.  Hulle  hardloop
altyd weg. Die agb lid Versveld het dit gedoen, en dis 'n voorbeeld.

Voorsitter, Minister, kollegas van die Raad, 'n klomp leuens, persepsies  en
verdraaide weergawes  het  die  laaste  tyd  die  ronde  gedoen  rondom  die
wetgewing, onder andere van die DA. Laat my  toe  om  die  volgende  te  sÃª.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr F Adams: Chairperson, it is simply typical of the DA  to  hit  and  run.
They are not prepared to stand and fight. They  always  run  away.  The  hon
member Versveld did this, and is an example.

Chairperson, Minister and  colleagues  of  the  Council,  a  pack  of  lies,
perceptions and distorted  versions  regarding  the  legislation  have  been
doing the rounds lately, spread by, amongst others, the DA. Allow me to  say
the following.]

Minister, I think that the only persons  who  will  deliver  a  pizza  to  a
postbox will be the DA. Just watch them in the elections. They will  be  the
only persons who will deliver a pizza to a postbox. [Laughter.]

The lies that they have spread and the uncertainty that  they  have  created
in the press and in South Africa are a shame.

Baie dankie dat die lid naby my kom sit, want dan kan sy hoor wat ek sÃª.  As
sy ver sit, sÃª sy altyd  sy  hoor  nie  wat  ek  sÃª  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I want to thank the member  for  moving  closer  to  where  I  am  sitting,
because now she will be able to hear what I am saying.  When  she  sits  far
away,  she  always  complains  that  she  cannot  hear  what  I  am  saying.
[Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Sandra Botha! You are out of  order.  You
can't stand in front of the person who is addressing  the  Chairperson.  You
are totally out of order. [Interjections.] Hon Sandra, take your seat  where
you are supposed to sit. Mr Adams, you may continue.

Mr  F  ADAMS:  Chairperson,  this  is  an  example  of  showing  no  respect
whatsoever. They also show no respect for what the Government  is  doing  to
uplift and create a better life for all people. That is  the  DA;  they  are
always moaning and groaning.

Hulle maak altyd 'n geraas, en  dis  hoekom  die  Nuwe  NP  besluit  het  om
samewerkende regering aan te gryp, en nie in die  hoek  te  staan  en  skree
soos 'n klein kefferhondjie - u weet, soos hierdie chihauhaus -  en ``pa-pa-
pa-pa'' te maak nie, Voorsitter. [Gelag.] Ons het  besluit  op  samewerkende
regering. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[They are always making a noise, and that is the reason the New  NP  decided
to seize the opportunity of co-operative governance, instead of  barking  in
a corner like a yapper - you know, like these chihuahuas - and  going  ``pa-
pa-pa-pa'',  Chairperson.  [Laughter.]  We  have  decided  on   co-operative
governance.

The department has issued written communiques and press  statements  to  the
effect that it will not put courier companies  that  transport  items  below
one kg out of business. It is obvious  from  the  submissions  made  by  the
industry bodies to the select committee that there  is  a  need  to  clarify
this legislation, and its impact on this industry and the  broader  business
community. I think that  the  Minister  and  the  department  have,  in  the
process, clarified the legislation, as has the select committee.

Minister, the deputy director-general has  given  an  undertaking  that  the
negotiations and  engagement  will  still  take  place  with  the  industry.
Minister, I want to ask you - not demand from you like the DA does  but  ask
you - if you will give a commitment that your department  will  engage  with
the industry and  with  the  industry  bodies  that  have  requested  future
amendments  to  this  legislation  to  ensure  that  the   significant   and
differentiated services offered by them are safeguarded?

Ten slotte wil ek graag die Minister, die adjunk-direkteur-generaal  en  die
departement bedank vir hul bereidwilligheid om  verdere  gesprekke  met  die
industrie te voer, asook die voorsitter en lede van die gekose  komitee,  en
veral mnr John du Preez van SA Express  Parcel  Association  vir  hul  harde
werk, bydrae en insette in hierdie  verband.  Dit  sal  help.  Gesprek  help
altyd, nie skree nie. Gesprek help  altyd,  en  ek  wil  vandag  die  DA  'n
politieke les leer: aan my twee kollegas, bly stil,  luister  en  leer.  Die
Nuwe NP  steun  hierdie  wetgewing.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion I would like to thank  the  Minister,  the  deputy  director-
general and the department for their willingness to have further talks  with
the industry. I also wish to  thank  the  chairperson  and  members  of  the
select committee, and especially Mr John du Preez  from  SA  Express  Parcel
Association for their hard work, contribution  and  input  in  this  regard.
This will help. To talk always helps; shouting  does  not.  To  talk  always
helps, and today I want to teach the  DA  a  political  lesson:  to  my  two
colleagues,  be  quiet,  listen  and  learn.  The  New   NP   supports   the
legislation. [Applause.]]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I wish to congratulate the  chairperson  of  our
select committee on the way in which she has actually handled  the  problems
associated with this Bill. She was very cool and skilful.

Fundamentally, the import of this Bill is that all citizens,  regardless  of
race or gender, have equal access to  basic  postal  services.  Integral  to
national policy for  the  postal  sector  is  the  provision,  again,  of  a
universal service. The  most  important  thing  to  me  is  that  this  will
actually ensure that all citizens  have  equal  access  to  a  basic  letter
service.

When one actually scrutinises the Bill, one finds that there is nothing  new
that this Bill introduces except that it creates an enabling environment  in
which to operate and provide services to the rest of  the  citizens  of  the
country.

Asingakubalekeli  lokhu  kodwa  asibhekane   nakho   ngqo   ukuthi   kukhona
umphakathi ovela ezindaweni zasemakhaya - kwantuthu, kwanjayiphume  -  lapho
ibhasi lihamba kanye  ekuseni  nemigwaqo  ingekho  khona;  futhi  lapho  uma
kufanele ulande incwadi kufuneka uhambe indawo engangokuthi usuka lapha  uya
ePaarl. Incwadi lena uma uyihambisa ebhasini kumshayeli  kufanele  uyiphathe
ngothi kanje,  uhambe  uze  uyoyinikeza  umshayeli  ukuze  ayokuposela  yona
edolobheni. Ibhasi lihamba usuku  lonke,  liyoze  libuye  mhlawumbe  ngehora
lesikhombisa ebusuku neposi. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Let us not deny the fact that there are communities who live in deep  rural
areas where a bus travels once in the morning and where there are no  roads.
Let us face that issue head-on. There are places where, if you need to  post
a letter, you have to walk a distance which is almost equal to walking  from
here to Paarl. If you want to post a letter you have to take  it  to  a  bus
driver so that he can post it for you in town. The bus takes the  whole  day
and only returns perhaps at about seven o'clock with the mail.]

Now, the Bill says we are taking the service right into those  rural  areas.
I think, perhaps, that that is the most central point  the  Bill  is  making
here because ...

... kubuhlungu kabi nxa  ingitshela  intokazi  yaseMaselekwini  ithi,  ``Awu
mntanomntanami, nina seniyabusa  ngoba  senivele  nithi  shwi!  shwi!  shwi!
nifike nipose niphinde nithathe iposi nibuye. Thina  sasihamba  usuku  lonke
siyoposa incwadi.'' Ngithi-ke mina, hawu, siyawuzwa umngunuzo  lona  oshaywa
abafokazi  laba  be-SA  Express  Parcel  Association   nabanye   wokukhalaza
mayelana nokuthi mhlawumbe bazolahlekelwa imisebenzi yabo.

Ngiyavumelana noNgqongqoshe kanye nodadewethu -  uNkk  Nkuna,  ukuthi  chabo
bo! akuqondiwe ukuthi bephucwe  imisebenzi  yabo.  Konke  esikushoyo  ukuthi
akwenzeke ukuthi wonke umuntu wanoma  yiliphi  ibala  akwazi  ukuthola  lolu
sizo lwezamaposi; iposi  libe  seduze  ukuze  umuntu  akwazi  ukuthi  aphume
endlini  afake  incwadi  kumbe  alande  incwadi  yakhe.  Lokho  kuwumgomo-ke
weqembu lami ukuthi abantu abahlwempu bakwazi njalo ukuthi nxa befuna  lokho
ababekulwela  bakuthole.  Ngicabanga  ukuthi   lokhu   kungomunye   wemigomo
esiyibiza ngokuthi uguquko.  Ngalawo  mazwi,  ngicela  ukubonga.  [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[... it becomes very painful when my grandmother says to me: ``My  grandson,
you are living in better times because you can  quickly  drive  over  there,
post and collect your letters, and come back. It used to  take  us  a  whole
day just to go and post a letter''. I am therefore saying we  are  aware  of
the complaints from  the  SA  Express  Parcel  Association  and  others  who
complain that perhaps they will lose their jobs.

I am in agreement with the Minister and my sister Mrs  Nkuna  regarding  the
fact that the intention is not to deprive anyone of their jobs. All  we  are
saying is that everyone, no matter what race they  belong  to,  should  have
access to postal services; and post offices should  be  situated  nearby  so
that one can simply walk a short distance to send or collect a letter.  That
is in accordance with the policy of my party, namely that  the  poor  should
receive access to what they fought for. I think such a  policy  is  part  of
what we call transformation. With those words, I would  like  to  say  thank
you. [Applause.]]

Mr T S SETONA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, it  is  indeed
an honour to participate  in  this  debate  today,  an  honour  because  the
opposition, in order to create propaganda, has been playing to  the  gallery
of the privileged, something which one writer to the letters'  column  of  a
national daily newspaper called ``a storm in a teacup''.

The  opposition's  objection  should  be  seen  for  what  it   really   is:
-opposition to services for black and poor people in general. This  is  what
the DA stands for. [Interjections.] We find it absolutely perplexing that  a
party comprising largely white, English-speaking and privileged  individuals
are whining about a practice that is  common  in  Europe  and  Canada.  They
don't challenge this when it is practised in those particular countries.

As the ANC we are here to ensure that expression is given to the  wishes  of
our constituencies, which remain the poorest of the poor in our country,  in
both the urban and rural areas. The ANC component of  the  select  committee
watched with keen interest the court battles between the SA Post Office  and
postal service providers in recent times.

We therefore commend the Minister and the Department of  Communications  for
bringing about the amendments to the principal Act in order to ensure  legal
certainty after these court challenges. Moreover, we  commend  the  Minister
and her department for the amendment to section 16, since it imposes on  the
SA Post Office a universal service obligation.  What  is  significant  about
this universal service obligation is the fact that it will now  ensure  that
people from the most remote corners of our country are able  to  communicate
through the mode of letter writing, for example.

Given the legacy of colonialism and apartheid, the larger  majority  of  our
people are indeed isolated and far removed from the click of  a  button.  In
fact, to most of them, telecommunications is an unknown language.
The Bill before this House this afternoon therefore represents a major  leap
forward and  will  go  a  long  way  towards  ensuring  that  the  lines  of
communications are opened, and  not  only  between  friends  and  relatives,
because it creates the opportunity for rural dwellers  to  communicate  with
us, their public representatives and  councillors,  and  to  make  enquiries
about Government services in general. The amendment  before  this  House  is
indeed most appropriate.

We also welcome the amendment that will ensure  that  courier  companies  no
longer exploit the loophole that existed in the  principal  Act,  hence  the
amendment to section 22  of  the  principal  Act.  For  far  too  long  have
unscrupulous courier services encroached on the reserved  services  area  of
the SA Post Office. We therefore take umbrage at  the  threatening  position
taken by the cartels of the courier industry about court  action,  when  our
only objective is to create a better life for all our people.

We believe that these amendments are in  line  with  the  new  turned-around
image of the SA Post Office. We are glad to note that  it  terminated  loss-
making contracts and that its restructuring processes are yielding  positive
results. Also, we are informed that  after  incurring  operating  losses  in
recent times, it is looking forward to turning the tide next year.

Let me address two issues here by joining my chairperson, the hon Nkuna.  It
is indeed a fact that as Parliament, having passed the Bill two  weeks  ago,
we made a very painstaking effort to  listen  to  the  interest  groups,  as
represented by DHL, the SA Express Parcel Association and  other  interested
parties. We sat with them for the better part of the day yesterday. More  of
the issues that were raised in the media about 500Â 000 job  losses  and  the
closure of more than a thousand SMMEs, was  raised  by  those  stakeholders,
directly or indirectly.

We want to say that it would be misleading to our public and to this  august
House for any member of this House to suggest that  after  our  deliberation
with those  stakeholders  they  still  maintained  their  position.  The  SA
Express Council Association has made its position very clear  -  that  after
our explanation of the contents of  this  Bill  all  their  fears  had  been
addressed. They will actually anticipate a scenario in the future  in  which
an ongoing interface between them and the department is enhanced to  clarify
any misunderstanding. So our meeting yesterday was  indeed  a  breakthrough,
and this is what we are paid for  as  ANC  representatives  in  this  august
House.

Quite clearly the voices of doom that have been echoed by the hon member  of
the  DA  are  nothing  but  a  panic  button,  a  panic  button   aimed   at
electioneering  tactics  reminiscent  of  the  cowboy  tactics  of  the  DP.
[Interjections.]

What the DA was  doing  yesterday  was  representing  the  voices  of  those
particular industrialists who were making  their  own  presentation  in  the
committee. After we had convinced them - when they agreed with  the  ANC-led
Government position around this Bill - the DA had no words to utter in  that
particular committee. [Interjections.] The hon representative  from  the  DA
left the committee and came to join the House, because she lost  the  battle
fatally.

One is surprised that after we made this  breakthrough  yesterday,  the  hon
Sandra Botha again comes to this House and echoes the same  voices  of  doom
that have been expressed in newspaper articles, which in our  view,  as  the
ANC, we were able to clarify yesterday. And, in the view of  the  ANC,  this
would be a betrayal of Moses Kotane, of Joe Slovo, of  Oliver  Tambo  if  we
succumb to these cheap electioneering tactics of the  DA,  and  we  are  not
going to succumb. The position of the DA is nothing but representative of  a
dying breed of political dinosaur that still clings to  the  umbilical  cord
of racism. [Interjections.]

In more than 90 years of its existence, the ANC has never  survived  on  the
basis of lies. It is the policy and the tradition of  the  ANC  to  confront
issues as they arise, and we have never  had  any  difficulties  surrounding
this particular piece of legislation.

On the basis of that I want to put on record in this august  House  that  of
all the issues, hon Minister, pertaining to the submissions that  were  made
to our committee and to the department, none of those  issues  was  relevant
to the areas that this Bill aims  to  amend.  Those  issues  were  basically
challenging the fundamental thrust of  the  principal  Act,  and  as  public
representatives we cannot allow that particular scenario.

I wish that one day the DA becomes the governing party in  this  country  so
that it is able, from time to time, to allow anyone to come forward,  as  he
or she wishes to, to change the law as he or she likes.  We  are  saying  as
the ANC that we support this Bill. It is in the  interests  of  accelerating
service to the poorest of the poor, and on that basis I want to  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Chairperson, it is quite clear, and  I
am really impressed, that members  of  this  House  who  are  serious  about
democracy indeed went through the Bill all over again to satisfy  themselves
about what their mandate is, a mandate which they  have  received  from  the
people; and then made sure that they adhered  to  something  that  has  been
part of the culture of the ANC, introduced  by  the  ANC  in  this  country,
which is consultation with the people.

I was quite surprised to hear that we did not  consult  on  this  Bill.  The
department engaged in roadshows in October and  November  of  last  year  on
possible amendments. The workshops were held in all the  provinces.  So,  it
is not true that there was no consultation. We follow the culture  which  we
have been taught, a culture that has  caused  the  kind  of  democratisation
that is taking place in this country. It is a new culture.

I think because we are the democrats we are, the DA has certainly the  right
to go to the ANC President. They have a democratic  right  to  ask.  I  hope
they also understand that he has a democratic right to either  agree  or  to
disagree. There will be nothing undemocratic when he doesn't agree.  I  hope
they will remember that.

Globally, courier services are  part  of  postal  services.  There  are  189
countries all over the world which are members of  the  UPU.  They  are  all
regulated. Why is it that courier services don't want to be  registered  and
regulated here? [Interjections.] The reason is  unclear  to  me.  But  given
what is happening, for example, in countries like the  United  States  under
the Homeland Security Act, with all the security  consciousness  they  have,
the situation in such a so-called democratic country will get even worse.

As the hon Setona indicated, the problem is not with our amendments,  it  is
with our principal Act. And we are dealing with  an  amendment  to  the  Act
which regularises it. We should not cloud the issues.  Therefore,  I  think,
because the members have indeed done their work, they understand what  these
issues are.

Yesterday I was asking my department about this  and  it  seemed  there  was
supposed  to  be  some   legal   opinion   that   said   this   matter   was
unconstitutional. We have gone back to the state law adviser. We  have  gone
back to other lawyers, and they  have  advised  us  that  there  is  nothing
unconstitutional about this. In fact, we  are  regularising  something  that
should have been done quite some time ago, because the  length  of  time  we
took has actually allowed people who were not legal to  make  encroachments;
and even those who might have been legal operators to also now want to  make
encroachments.

In looking at part of the Act now, the Post Office now has competition  from
all the courier services with regard to anything that weighs more  than  one
kilogram. If the private business industry beats the Post  Office,  then  it
is the Post Office's problem. The reason we have said we must  make  this  a
reserved area is in order to allow the Post Office, as we have said,  to  be
able to do the kinds of things that those very businesses have  no  interest
in, because they are not prepared to service those people.
Unlike what is, in fact, given or portrayed here,  if  the  Post  Office  is
able to roll out the four million postal addresses -  there  is  nothing  to
stop the Post Office from saying, ``because it is our  obligation  to  bring
that letter to your farm, hon Sandra Botha'' -  it  will  find  those  SMMEs
that must get on their bicycles and go and deliver that  mail.  It  is  only
this protection that we give them that will enable those bicycles  -  small-
medium enterprises - to be able to deliver. Unless we do so,  you  will  not
be able to get your letter. We are actually working for your benefit too.

On the competitions issue, it sounds as if they are saying courier  services
should not be regulated at all. I don't understand, under the  circumstances
that I  have  already  given,  why  we  should  not  have  courier  services
regulated. It is like the Competition Commission also  saying  that  because
the service is not registered, competition must therefore just  be  a  free-
for-all. You cannot cause havoc through  lawlessness  and  an  inability  to
manage the industry.

We have to be able to say that we know who the people are  who  deliver  and
what kinds of things they are allowed to be able to  deliver,  because  they
have been registered. Otherwise you can have any Tom, Dick or  Harry  coming
from any part of the world, the underworld included, and doing all kinds  of
things. I think what we are doing is to bring  law  into  the  industry,  to
maintain that law, and to manage the industry, as best as we  can,  for  the
benefit of all South Africans, but particularly the poor.

I thank the members for supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:29.
