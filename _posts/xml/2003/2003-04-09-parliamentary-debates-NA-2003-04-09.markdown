                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson,  thank
you very much. This Bill, like most other judicial amendment Bills,  intends
to effect amendments to a number of Acts of Parliament that do  not  require
individual amendment Bills. In terms of the Administration  of  Estates  Act
of 1965, the Minister appoints a Master for each High  Court.  The  Minister
may also appoint Deputy Masters and  Assistant  Masters  for  each  Master's
Office, who may in terms of the Administration of Estates  Act  do  anything
which may lawfully be done  by  the  Master,  subject  to  the  control  and
supervision of the Master.

There are ten offices of the Master of  the  High  Court  in  the  Republic.
Although the Master of the High Court in  Pretoria  is  sometimes  described
and accepted as the Chief Master, there is no statutory authority  for  such
an office. Masters are appointed in terms of the Administration  of  Estates
Act and are obliged to carry out their duties and exercise their  powers  in
terms  of  this  Act,  the  Insolvency  Act  of  1936  and   other   related
legislation. It is undesirable that each  Master  has  different  approaches
and practices in respect of important or highly publicised matters  such  as
the appointment  of  trustees,  liquidators  and  similar  functionaries  in
insolvent estates.In order to provide for uniformity  within  the  different
Masters' Offices, the Bill amends the Administration of Estates Act of  1965
to make provision for the appointment  of  the  Chief  Master  of  the  High
Courts. The Chief Master will, as  the  executive  office  of  the  Masters'
Offices, exercise such supervision over all the Masters' Offices as  may  be
necessary, in order to bring about the required uniformity.

In order to address the  imbalances  that  exist  with  the  appointment  of
trustees,  liquidators,  judicial  managers  and  similar  functionaries  in
insolvency-related matters and in order  to  actively  advance  and  empower
previously  disadvantaged  people  in  line  with  Government   policy,   my
department has developed a policy on the procedure for  the  appointment  of
these functionaries.

This policy aims to create uniform procedures in all  the  Masters'  Offices
for the appointment of trustees, liquidators, judicial managers and  similar
functionaries.  The  policy  is  further  aimed  at  promoting  consistency,
fairness,  transparency  and  the  achievement  of  equality   for   persons
previously disadvantaged by unfair discrimination.

This policy  is  also  aimed  at  promoting  the  image  of  the  insolvency
practitioners in the  Masters'  Division.  We  are  therefore  amending  the
Insolvency  Act  of  1936,  the  Companies  Act  of  1973  and   the   Close
Corporations Act of 1984, in order to make it clear  that  the  Master  must
act in accordance with the policy determined by  the  Minister  for  Justice
and  Constitutional  Development  when  making   these   appointments.   The
practical effect of this amendment is that it would ensure that there is  no
corruption in the appointment process. The amendments proposed in  the  Bill
will all have the effect of enhancing the administration of justice.

May I take this opportunity to  thank  the  portfolio  committee  under  the
leadership of Adv Johnny de Lange for their efforts and hard work  put  into
the consideration of this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Chair, let me  say  at  the  outset  that  we  support  this
legislation, but we have some clear reservations, which I  will  spell  out.
The legislation allows for two innovations. Firstly, it makes provision  for
the appointment of a Chief Master who will be the  chief  executive  of  all
the Masters' Offices and  ``will  exercise  such  supervision  for  all  the
Masters as may be necessary, in order to bring  about  uniformity  in  their
practice and procedure''.

The caveat we have is this, and I address the hon Minister directly:  Please
ensure that the appointment is such that it will serve  transformation,  but
in the fullest sense of the word. Not only transformation in  the  sense  of
affirmative action, but transformation in  the  sense  of  improved  service
delivery. We need that desperately in those offices.

The second innovation is the following. The Minister is given the  authority
to prescribe policy for implementation by the Masters in the appointment  of
curators, trustees and others. This  policy  must  be  formulated  and  ``in
order to promote consistency, fairness, transparency and the achievement  of
equality for persons previously disadvantaged by unfair discrimination''.  I
have some remarks to the hon Minister.

First of all, your policy must  take  due  cognisance  of  the  position  of
creditors and of beneficiaries of those estates which will  come  under  the
management of the trustees, liquidators and so forth. After  all,  they  are
the people who are entitled  to  have  their  interests  protected.  Please,
entrench the say of these people  in  the  appointment  of  those  who  will
manage these estates. Flowing from this, the hon Minister's policy must  aim
at creating effective and sound administration of those estates and  assets.
This objective may never run second after the ideal of affirmative action.

Thirdly, the policy must not enrich a chosen few. The  liquidation  business
is a multimillion rand business. Recent reports talk of,  in  one  instance,
fees of R36 million to be divided between  five  liquidators.  Do  not  fall
into that trap, Mr Minister. See  to  it  that  capable  people  across  the
spectrum are used when these  appointments  are  made.  The  policy  of  the
Minister  will  be  tabled  in  Parliament.  We  shall  scrutinise  it,  hon
Minister. If necessary, you will hear from  us  loudly  and  clearly.  Thank
you.

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson, I rise on this  occasion  to  unconditionally
support this legislation on behalf of the  ANC.  And  that  is  a  surprise,
seeing as I chaired the path of the legislation. [Interjections.] There  are
some things in life that will never happen and one of them is  walking  over
to this side. [Interjections.] There goes one  of  my  minutes;  give  me  a
chance here.

There are obviously two  issues  we  are  dealing  with  here.  Firstly  the
appointment of a Chief Master for this country. With all the tasks  we  have
had and even under the apartheid system,  the  Master's  Office  has  always
been a bit of a stepchild of the justice system. That is starting to  change
now. We have a special business unit that deals with  the  Master's  Office,
because as the hon Andrew will tell you, in the Master's  Office  there  are
millions and billions of rands tied up. If  the  Master's  Office  does  not
operate properly that money does not again get into circulation. So I  think
it is time, as is starting to happen in this country, that  we  realise  the
importance of the Master's Office, realise the importance of proper  service
delivery and start to unleash  and  unfold  and  get  that  money  into  the
economy again as soon as  possible.  You  are  dealing  here  with  estates.
People have died and their assets  have  to  be  dealt  with  and  given  to
beneficiaries. You are dealing with liquidations and so forth. And  in  that
we need to make sure that the system works properly.

We have over the last while, in  a  piecemeal  way,  which  we  had  to  do,
started amending aspects of the laws around the Master's  Office  so  as  to
make it function better and give it more  resources.  If  you  look  at  the
latest budget allocations you will see that there have been  more  resources
given to that.

More importantly, to co-ordinate and harmonise their work so that  there  is
a uniform practice and conventions coming from that office, we are now  also
appointing a Chief Master in the legislation. It was  usually  the  case  in
practical terms that the Master of Pretoria used to be the Chief Master.  We
are now  doing  it  in  legislation  so  that  there  are  clear  duties  of
responsibility and so forth.

The second issue is that for the first time ever, also  in  legislation,  we
are spelling out what policies  need  to  be  looked  at  and  applied  when
appointments of liquidators, curators, judicial managers  and  trustees  are
done in terms of the Administration of Estates Act, the Insolvency Act,  the
Companies Act and  the  Close  Corporations  Act.  This  is  very  important
because what it is doing is, in a transparent way, putting the  policies  on
the table.

Firstly, we can all be part of it and  see  what  it  is  going  to  be  and
hopefully in that way make sure that, firstly, corruption is stemmed in  its
infancy. For a while now  corruption  has  been  thriving  in  the  Master's
Office and some prosecutions have proved that. But, on the  other  hand,  it
also gives us the opportunity in a legal way and with a legal  mechanism  to
open up the liquidators' profession and the  trustees'  profession  so  that
those that had been excluded can also be part of  it.  With  regard  to  the
warnings that were put forward by Dr Delport, clearly we will look at  that.
That is also one of the reasons that you have mentioned why we are  actually
putting it in legislation that there should be such a policy.

There was no reason for us to do that. The Minister  could  have  drafted  a
policy and could have given it to them to apply and there  would  have  been
no problem. We are doing it in this way  to  ensure  openness,  transparency
and exactly to try and avoid the  pitfalls  that  have  been  part  of  this
system in the past. Thank you to everyone who has supported it and  for  all
the hard work in passing this legislation. [Applause.]

Mr T E VEZI: Thank you very much, Chair. A number of imbalances  exist  with
regard to the appointment of trustees and liquidators in insolvency  matters
dealt with by the Masters' Offices. This is in  essence  against  Government
policy, as the Masters currently have a measure of discretion in  appointing
such  persons.  In  order  to  correct  historical   imbalances   with   the
appointment  of  persons  dealing  with  insolvencies,  the  Bill   proposes
amendments to  the  Companies  Act,  the  Close  Corporations  Act  and  the
Insolvency Act, to ensure that the Masters act  in  accordance  with  policy
set by the Minister for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  when  it
comes to the appointment of persons in these cases.

The main aim of these amendments is to  achieve  consistency,  fairness  and
equality  as  far  as  the  appointment  of  trustees  and  liquidators   in
insolvency matters is concerned. The IFP  supports  the  approach  with  the
Judicial Matters Amendment Bill, in the sense that a  number  of  amendments
to existing laws are dealt with in one consolidated  Bill,  rather  than  in
various different amendment Bills. The  consolidated  approach  saves  time,
saves money  and  energy  and  means  that  Parliament  can  deal  with  the
amendments in a particular issue in a comprehensive manner, rather  than  in
a  fragmented  manner  in  different  amendment  Bills,   should   different
amendment Bills be presented.

The IFP supports the main objectives of the Bill, as  they  aim  to  rectify
inconsistencies and imbalances relating to the Masters'  Offices  throughout
the country that are basically and practically a remnant of the system  that
operated under apartheid. The Masters' Offices deal with  mainly  commercial
issues such as liquidations, administration of  estates  and  sequestration.
Huge amounts of money are therefore involved and it  is  best  that,  in  an
economic sense, the same standards and practices  are  applied  consistently
and uniformly throughout South Africa. The  IFP  supports  the  Bill.  [Time
expired.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Chairperson and hon members, this amending  Bill  intends  to
amend  four  Acts,  namely,  the  Insolvency  Act,  Act  24  of  1936,   the
Administration of Estates Act, Act 99 of 1965, the Companies Amendment  Act,
Act 66 of 1984 and the Close Corporations Act, Act 69 of 1984.

The Insolvency Act intends to  include  who  will  be  responsible  for  the
administration of justice to  determine  policy  and  further  regulate  the
appointment of curators bonis,  trustees,  provisional  trustees  and  court
trustees by the Master of the High Courts.
The Administration of Estates Act, Act 66 of 1973, is amended to the  extent
that it provides for the appointment of a Chief Master of  the  High  Court.
The amendment to the Companies Amendment Act intends to enable the  Minister
responsible for the administration of  justice  to  determine  policies  and
further regulate the appointment of  liquidators,  provisional  liquidators,
court liquidators and judicial managers by the Master of the High Court.

The amending Bill further intends to amend the  Close  Corporations  Act  to
enable the  Minister  responsible  for  the  administration  of  justice  to
determine policy for and further regulate the appointment of liquidators  by
the Master of the High Court.

The UDM supports the Bill.

Ms N MAHLAWE: Hon Chairperson and  hon  members,  this  Bill,  as  has  been
indicated by the Minister, seeks to bring a variety  of  amendments  into  a
single Bill. These amendments flow from the following Acts:  the  Insolvency
Act, Act 24 of 1936, the Administration of Estates Act, Act 66 of 1965,  the
Companies Act, Act 66 of 1973 and the Close  Corporations  Act,  Act  69  of
1984.

These Acts previously gave powers to Masters  of  High  Courts  to  exercise
their discretion in  the  performance  of  their  duties  without  statutory
authority.  As  has  been  observed  over  the  years,  this   resulted   in
inconsistency and unfairness, and  there  has  been  no  uniformity  in  the
functioning of the Masters of High Courts.

The amendments therefore enable the Cabinet member responsible  for  justice
to make policies and regulate the functioning of the Masters of High  Courts
in the appointment  of  trustees,  court  trustees  and  curators  bonis  to
administer  insolvent  estates  and  the  appointment  of  liquidators   and
provisional judicial managers. Such are the amendments to the Companies  Act
and the Close Corporations Act. Furthermore  also,  the  amendments  provide
for the appointment of a Chief Master of the High Courts,  that  is  in  the
administration of estates.
The  policies  and  regulations  so  formulated  would  aim   at   promoting
consistency, fairness, transparency  and  achievement  of  equality  in  the
process.

The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, one of the objectives of this policy,  as  envisaged
in the amending Bill, is to create uniform procedures in  all  the  Masters'
Offices for the appointment of trustees and liquidators and to  promote  the
image of insolvency practitioners and the Masters' Division.

The  stated  aim  of  this  policy  is  to  promote  consistency,  fairness,
transparency and the achievement of equality in the appointment process.  It
is undeniable that there have been abuses and corruption in the past in  the
appointment process that need to be addressed.

Public comment should be invited  during  the  development  of  this  policy
before it is published in the Gazette and tabled  in  Parliament.  We  trust
that the hon the Minister will determine policy of this  nature  only  after
full  consultation  with  all  stakeholders  and   particularly   the   body
representing insolvency practitioners.

We  do,  however,  appreciate  the  approach  taken   by   legislating   the
development of this policy and will support the Bill while at the same  time
sounding a warning  that  we  will  carefully  study  the  proposed  policy.
[Applause.]

Dr S E  M  PHEKO:  Mr  Chairman,  the  PAC  supports  the  Judicial  Matters
Amendment Bill. It is necessary legislation, amending the Insolvency Act  of
1936, a pretty old law whose relevance certainly needs revisitation  because
of the circumstances of 1936 and the conditions of 2003.

The purpose of this Bill is chiefly to insert a definition  of  ``Minister''
to enable the Cabinet member responsible for the administration  of  justice
to determine policy on matters such as the appointment of  trustees.  Simply
put, the main aim of the Bill is to encompass in a single Bill a variety  of
amendments which do not require individual amending Bills.

The PAC supports the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF notes the  number  of  amendments  that
this Bill makes, finding it viable as it saves the House  time  in  amending
individually.

The MF agrees with the clarity provided by the definition of ``masters''  in
this Bill. The control that this Bill aims to attain over the  Chief  Master
is supported in bringing uniformity, efficiency, transparency and  a  system
of checks and balances. The control brought  over  Masters  to  correct  the
imbalances  to  the  appointment  of  trustees,  liquidators   and   similar
functionaries, among other insolvency matters, is supported.

We constantly have to remind ourselves that  we  are  a  government  by  the
people, for the people.  Being  a  democracy  government  in  constitutional
supremacy, the provisions made  in  this  Bill  for  fairness,  consistency,
transparency and equality are valid.

The MF supports the Judicial Matters Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr M J MALAHLELA: Mr Chairperson, the passing of this Bill today  represents
another package  of  our  Government's  reconstruction  and  development  as
headed by a proletariat biased of the ANC. Our political engine was  ignited
to respond to our people's clarion  call  that  increasing  liquidations  in
South Africa are  worsening  the  high  unemployment  rate  and  aggravating
poverty, and not the ANC, as people want us to believe.

It was and still is our cherished  ideal  that  the  pronouncements  of  the
congress of  our  people  in  Kliptown  can  be  realised  as  long  as  the
proletariat of our country continue to be active participants at  the  level
of our economy, where we also want liquidators to do their work.  A  measure
of protection in enhancing our proletariat's job security  was  a  necessary
tool to prevent bogus liquidation of companies by  those  who  are  keen  to
maximise capital through exploitation of our proletariat's labour power.

Therefore, we would support this Bill as the ANC, which  indicates  that  we
transform the labour relations agencies in making sure that in matters  that
deal with negotiations for operational requirements  workers  will  continue
to be consulted, as opposed to being told what needs to be done.

The consequence which we looked into as a political  organisation,  is  that
it will increase the protection of the proletariat's claims in the event  of
insolvencies, so that after the payments  of  secured  creditors'  preferent
claims, what is due to the proletariat should be paid first.

As Government we continue to have a keen interest in the  King  Commission's
report on corporate governance so as  to  prevent  the  Enron  scandal  that
robbed the US economy from being exported to our shores.  In  so  doing,  we
continuously appeal to the auditing  firms  to  follow  to  the  letter  the
generally accepted accounting principles for liquidation of companies  as  a
menace to our fragile but stubborn economy.

We would further encourage those political parties that are facing  a  bleak
future, as a result of  the  floor-crossing  legislation,  to  inform  their
employees about  the  prospects  of  their  party's  liquidations  -  either
provisional, final, voluntary or compulsory - for the said employees  to  be
able to prepare thoroughly their exit.

Our successful review of all insolvency laws  in  favour  of  our  country's
proletariat, who continue to drive the economy of our  country,  constitutes
an achievement that is beneficial to our country, continent and  workers  of
the world. It is, however, only those  students  of  Joseph  Goebbels  whose
thesis was and continues to be that ``the bigger the lie,  the  more  likely
the people are to believe it'', who  can't  giggle  at  our  achievement  in
passing this Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr  Chairperson,  I
thank the hon members for this very short  debate  on  this  Bill.  I  thank
them, particularly, for the correct positions that  all  of  us  have  taken
with regard to this Bill.

The hon Delport, quite correctly, says that it's our duty to scrutinise  the
policy and, as has been pointed out, we could easily have said, well,  we'll
make the policy and then start implementing it as  the  department.  But  we
felt that we should actually involve the  duly  elected  representatives  of
our people in the evolution of this policy.

I thought I should actually, with the time allocated to me,  illustrate  the
problems that we are dealing with by way  of  expressing  my  own  happiness
that hon Delport has actually talked about, for instance, the issue  of  the
few getting enriched through liquidations.

In 2001, in one province 83% of liquidation work went to one firm only.  The
rest - black and white - shared the rest of the work.  In  another  province
65% went  to  one  firm  and  the  rest  was  shared  by  the  rest  of  the
liquidators.

I am told by liquidators - black and white - that it's not  just  enough  to
be put on a liquidators' panel at the Master's Office. A lot of people  are,
indeed, liquidators because they have been put on  those  panels,  but  they
say clambering onto the panel itself is a very  difficult  task.  You  never
know with certainty whether you will be appointed  as  you  apply  to  be  a
liquidator. Some are lucky and others are not, because again you never  know
how the Master is going to exercise  his  discretion  with  regard  to  your
application. There is a lot of uncertainty.

But, having been put into the panel - it's very interesting  that  you  then
have to approach them with trepidation - you are hoping  against  hope  that
you may get work from them. Many people  have  never  done  any  liquidation
work if, indeed, in one province 83% goes to one firm only.  So,  we've  got
to deal with that sort of situation.

What is also very interesting is that one time, I am told, after this  House
had passed a law amending the Companies Act of 1973 so  that  the  SARS  and
labour unions representing workers in a company  going  through  liquidation
should be informed about the pending liquidation  -  after  we  had  amended
that - a worker in the Master's Office in Pretoria  then  decides  that  all
they do is just to inform them. They do not have an automatic  right  to  be
represented in a liquidation. She then says: ``Therefore, I  decide  who  is
going to be represented here - you don't decide that.''

So, it doesn't matter how many workers  are  to  be  affected.  She  decides
liquidator X is presumed to be capable  of  representing  the  interests  of
all. So when we asked her as to where in the  law  it  states  that  workers
must now be represented and that the only right they have under this law  is
the right to be informed, she says: ``Oh!  Sorry  Minister,  I  misread  the
law''.

She could indeed have genuinely misread the law. But, this Bill will  enable
us to appoint the sort of person to whom all these complaints are  going  to
go, because there is no way any Minister with  small  or  broader  shoulders
can actually deal with the situation there.

The Masters' Offices, for instance, are in charge of the Guardian's  Fund  -
which I am advised this year is in excess of R2 billion. Now, that's  a  lot
of money to be left in the  hands  of  people  who  exercise  this  sort  of
discretion in the manner I have described. They are responsible for too  big
sums of money for us not to pay attention to them.  So,  by  means  of  this
Bill we are saying, as the hon Johnny De Lange has told us, they will  cease
to  be  a  stepchild  of  the  administration  of  justice.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

3.    Report of the Portfolio  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  on  Protocol
     Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council of  the
     African Union, dated 9 April 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, having  considered  the
         request for approval by Parliament of the Protocol Relating to  the
         Establishment of the Peace and  Security  Council  of  the  African
         Union, referred to it, and  having  conferred  with  the  Portfolio
         Committee on  Safety  and  Security,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
         Defence, the Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
         Development, the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Defence  and  the
         Working Group on the African Union, recommends that the  House,  in
         terms of section 231(2)  of  the  Constitution,  approve  the  said
         Protocol.


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         In its conference with the Working Group on the African Union,  the
         Working Group  indicated  that  the  South  African  constitutional
         mandate regarding  security  is  clear:  Security  policy  "...must
         reflect the resolve of South Africans,  as  individuals  and  as  a
         nation, ... to be free from fear and want  and  to  seek  a  better
         life." [Section 198(a)]. This broad, holistic approach to  security
         recognises the various non-military dimensions of security  and  is
         rooted in our collective experiences  of  insecurity.  Through  the
         various consultative processes that led  to  the  drafting  of  the
         White Paper on Defence and the Defence Review of  1998,  it  became
         clear  that  South  Africans  viewed  security  beyond  the  narrow
         confines of state security.


         This should guide the implementation of the Protocol, while  taking
         due  cognisance  of  the  needs  of  States  to   safeguard   their
         territorial integrity. This perspective and  the  understanding  of
         the inter-linkage between the  processes  of  conflict  resolution,
         peace-making,   reconciliation,   democracy,   human   rights   and
         development underlines South Africa's understanding of  sustainable
         peace and stability in our country, the region and the Continent.


         The United Nations' Secretary-General has  described  the  need  to
         define and promote this understanding of human security as  one  of
         the greatest challenges of the 21st Century.


     Request to be considered.
