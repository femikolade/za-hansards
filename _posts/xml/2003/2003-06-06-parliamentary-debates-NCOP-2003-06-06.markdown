ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS see col 000.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Does any  member  wish
to move a motion without notice? [Interjections.] What is  the  problem?  Is
it because it's Friday and everybody wants to go home?  [Interjections.]  No
motions on Friday? Okay, we will proceed then.

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 28 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Minister, I could  see
that they had been holding you hostage before you came into the House.  They
did not even want to allow you to come in here. Everybody wanted to  have  a
chat with you. I hope that they will have  enough  time  to  chat  with  you
after the debate. But, I can see that they are in a hurry to go home  as  it
is Friday.

The MINISTER OF  ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Deputy  Chairperson,
actually it was Rev Chabaku who was having a  confidential  discussion  with
me about a certain function that took place last  night.  However,  I  don't
think that it would be  proper  for  me  to  reveal  the  contents  of  that
discussion in a formal sitting. But, later on, I will be able  to  tell  you
what we were talking about.

Chairperson, hon members, MECs present here and guests,  in  September  last
year, leaders of  the  modern  world  stood  together  in  Johannesburg  and
adopted a far-reaching global programme for  sustainable  development.  This
was a watershed moment for South Africa. We have been widely  acclaimed  for
negotiating the  Johannesburg  Plan  of  Implementation.  It  is  visionary,
profound and practical. It gives hope and promise to all the struggling  and
marginalised people of the world. It also challenges us, as South  Africans,
to strive to meet the targets set in the plan of implementation.

In our own country, sustainable development  is  the  unifying  thread  that
runs through all of our work. We are nearly 10  years  into  South  Africa's
democratic order, and we can now state with confidence  that  our  work  and
collective efforts have paid off.  Our  home-grown  version  of  sustainable
development, the RDP, has delivered benefits for millions upon  millions  of
South Africans. We have made gains that benefit the poorest of  communities.
In the Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  through  decisive
interventions in the industries  that  we  deal  with  -  tourism,  fishing,
conservation  industries,  environmental  industries  and  the  marine   and
coastal industries - we have been able  to  realise  the  implementation  of
sustainable development programmes, which stand to benefit citizens of  this
country presently and future generations.

Provinces have been key  partners  in  the  realisation  of  many  of  those
objectives.  This  partnership  was  probably  best  demonstrated   in   the
successful hosting of the World Summit on Sustainable Development  in  which
the Gauteng province and the Johannesburg Metro played an outstanding  role.
Therefore, I would like to give  special  recognition  to  the  province  of
Gauteng and the Johannesburg Metro for their contribution and enthusiasm  in
the preparations for and hosting of the summit.

The Gauteng province's Greening of the Summit project set a new standard  in
the  minimisation  of  the  environmental  impact  of   large   events   and
conferences. Members of the Council should be aware that that was in fact  a
world standard. It sets a new standard, internationally, for the  organising
of big events in  an  environmentally  friendly  manner.  [Applause.]  Other
provinces and organised local government contributed  significantly  to  the
Government negotiating team, and in the organisation of  side  and  parallel
events.

I think that  we  should  also  give  Johannesburg  recognition  for  having
successfully used this great global gathering  to  reinvent  and  brand  the
city as a world city among the most advanced. Perceptions of the  city  have
changed dramatically. It is  now  a  cool  and  safe  place  with  a  highly
efficient modern  infrastructure,  and  one  which  has  warm  and  friendly
citizens. I think that this is a wonderful example of how big events can  be
used to turn around negative perceptions of our country, or of a  particular
city.

According to an independent study by the Bureau of  Market  Research,  Ikwla
Structured Financial Products and Urban Econ,  the  WSSD  injected  over  R8
billion into the South African economy. This is compared  to  an  investment
of about R620 million which  was  contributed  jointly  by  Government,  the
private sector, international sponsors and donor agencies.  The  latter  two
contributors, that is international sponsors and donors,  contributed  about
60% of the R620 million capital injection which went into the organising  of
the summit. The summit's black economic empowerment target was set  at  30%.
The records indicate that that was exceeded, and in the end 48% of what  was
spent went to black economic empowerment entities.

I must perhaps just repeat what I said in the National  Assembly  yesterday,
namely that there is also tremendous progress in  the  procurement  patterns
of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. We have now  reached
a point where 40% of  procurement  goes  to  BEE  companies.  The  director-
general has set himself a target that by the end of this year we will be  in
a situation in which 50% of all the department's  procurement  would  go  to
BEE companies. I think that the director-general and the  department  should
be congratulated for that. [Applause.]

The  spirit  of  co-operation  is  also  being  carried   forward   in   our
preparations for another equally significant international event. From 8  to
17 September this year,  South  Africa  will  be  hosting  the  World  Parks
Congress in Durban. This is an international congress that takes place  only
once every  10  years.  We  have  been  requested  to  host  this  event  in
recognition of our successful park management system and transfrontier  park
initiatives. It  is  expected  that  about  2  300  participants,  including
experts in the field of protected area management  from  around  the  world,
will attend this occasion.

Under the leadership of SA National Parks,  and  working  with  conservation
agencies in all provinces, we have already set in place processes that  will
ensure a successful conference and, once  again,  excellent  logistics.  The
province of KwaZulu-Natal and  eThekwini  Metro  will  play  a  particularly
important role in this regard. Part of  the  organisation  of  the  congress
will include pre-event and post-event tours across  the  country.  With  the
experience that we gathered from the  WSSD,  and  a  confirmation  of  South
Africa's ability through events like the recent Cricket World  Cup,  we  are
assured that the World Parks Congress will be nothing but a success.

Our working together in the spirit of co-operative  governance  has  allowed
us to contribute to the achievement of our objective of a  better  life  for
all. The MECs for environment, conservation and tourism  deserve  particular
credit for making the environment and tourism Minmecs dynamic and  effective
vehicles  for  co-operation.  In  addition,  through   the   committee   for
environmental co-ordination, we are able to report significant  progress  in
the promotion of integration and co-ordination  of  environmental  functions
between national and provincial governments. As a result of this, the  suite
of draft legislation that we will table this year further  aligns  the  work
of organs of state. This includes legislation on  biological  diversity  and
protected areas, and the  two  Bills  which  have  already  been  tabled  in
Parliament - as you may be aware. It also  includes  additional  legislation
on coastal resources, pollution, waste and air  quality.  These  instruments
will  provide  legal  protection  for  our  country's  environment,  promote
sustainable development and assist us in meeting many of  the  targets  that
we negotiated at the WSSD.

For the first time, national and provincial departments have put in place  a
comprehensive set of environmental management  plans.  On  the  department's
website  is  now  available  the  first  cycle  of  gazetted   environmental
implementation and management plans of  scheduled  national  and  provincial
government departments. You will also find, on  the  website,  an  alignment
report that is focused on some of the key environmental impact and  managing
sectors.

 We have now approached the office of the  Auditor-General  to  assist  with
the development of a mechanism that will enable  us  to  monitor  compliance
with environmental management and implementation plans. In this  regard,  it
is quite clear that the public sector has to take a lead, otherwise  we  run
the risk of lagging behind the private sector.  As you would be  aware,  the
JSE Securities Exchange will be introducing  a  sustainability  index  later
this year. I think  that  it  is  about  time  that  Government  departments
themselves  began  to  look  more  closely  at   their   own   environmental
management.

Following on our success in the implementation of  the  new  regulations  on
plastic  bags,  provinces  and  national  Government  departments  are   co-
ordinating efforts around tackling other waste streams. We will  shortly  be
taking over the function of regulating  landfills  from  the  Department  of
Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  and  we  will   transfer   some   of   these
responsibilities to the provinces. Before any of the MECs makes  the  point,
I  should  say  that  the  resources  will  follow  the  functions.  We  are
collaborating  in  tackling  the  serious  backlogs   in   municipal   waste
management and recycling.

At this stage, I think that it would  be  appropriate  to  congratulate  the
winners  of  the  2002  Cleanest  Town  Competition.  I  am   pleased   that
representatives of the cleanest towns are here with us today. For the  metro
category, the 2002 winner of the Cleanest Town Competition  was  the  Nelson
Mandela Metro and we have a representative, on behalf of the mayor,  who  is
here with us today. Congratulations! [Applause.]

I happened to be in  the  Nelson  Mandela  Metro  on  Sunday  to  meet  with
stakeholders in the fishing industry, and also to  attend  a  wonderful  ANC
banquet that evening. I don't think that I need to report on  that  function
here. [Interjections.] I do have the right. It  was  a  very  well-organised
function. It made me very proud to be a member of the ANC, and I was  amazed
at the extent of integrated and across-the-board support that  the  ANC  has
in that metro. But, that's not the topic for today.

What I wanted to say was that I had an  opportunity  to  drive  through  the
metro, and I was just amazed at how sprightly and clean that city  looks.  I
have no doubt that it is one of the cleanest cities in  our  country  today.
[Applause.] I think that we need to congratulate Mayor Faku because  he  has
taken it upon himself as a personal mission to  turn  around  the  image  of
that town. It no longer looks like a town in  decay,  a  forgotten  city  of
South Africa; it looks like a city that's going places.  In  fact,  I  think
that it is going places. As you know, tourism has picked up dramatically  in
the Nelson Mandela Metro. I have told them that they should not  be  shy  to
make full use of the name that they have. There is no other  city  that  can
have a wonderful  name  like  Nelson  Mandela.  They  should  use  that  for
branding, and to attract tourists.

In the local municipality segment, the 2002 winner of the cleanest town  was
the Newcastle local municipality. We have present here, His  Worship,  Mayor
Dlamini, the mayor of Newcastle. Congratulations! [Applause.]  Newcastle  is
a town with an extremely rich history, and  I  think  tourism  is  again  an
important hope for a town like Newcastle, taking into account that  some  of
the other industrial activities have been on the decline over the  past  few
years. In the district municipality category, last  year's  winner  was  the
Eden District Municipality. We have  present  here  Councillor  Taute  -  he
probably has gone out to wash his hands in the meantime. Congratulations  on
that win. [Applause.]
In September this year, we will be announcing  the  winners  of  the  second
round of the Cleanest Town Competition. The competition is proving to  be  a
successful campaign in mobilising municipalities and communities around  the
national  waste  management  strategy.  One   of   the   most   far-reaching
interventions around co-operative governance in the  last  decade  has  been
the  introduction  of  the  system  of  environmental  impact   assessments.
Inevitably, as we are in the process of the reconstruction  and  development
of our country, we are bound  to  impact  on  our  environment  and  natural
resources. That impact might be positive or negative, hence  the  importance
of regulating the development and its impact on the environment.

 Some environmental  impact  assessments,  or  EIAs,  are  considered  at  a
national level, but  the  vast  majority  of  development  applications  are
processed by provinces. During this past year, my department  has  processed
88 EIAs, which comprised projects estimated  at  a  value  of  R43  billion.
These include the N4 Platinum Toll Highway, which will of  course  link  the
west coast of Southern Africa with the east coast of  Southern  Africa;  the
Coega  Industrial  Development  Project   and   the   Coega   Harbour;   the
construction of  an  underground  natural  gas  pipeline  from  Mozambique's
Temane and Pande gas fields to Secunda in  Mpumalanga;  the  development  of
support infrastructure within the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park,  and  29
applications related to Government's poverty relief programme.

The EIA system is an  essential  part  of  the  development  and  investment
process, and the above projects give some idea of the  scale  and  value  of
many of the projects we consider.

Two important projects are presently under consideration by the  department.
The one is the N2 highway through the Wild Coast, which  the  South  African
Roads Agency intends to build, which would bring an investment of  about  R2
billion into  an  area  that  really  needs  jobs.  But  the  department  is
considering that. I do not know whether they will allow it or  not.  As  you
know, it is not the decision of the Minister, it  is  the  decision  of  the
officials.
The other project that the  department  is  considering  is  the  pebble-bed
modular reactor. This is an application from Eskom  Enterprises,  of  course
supported by the Department of Minerals and Energy, for the construction  of
an experimental module of the pebble-bed modular reactor at Koeberg.  Again,
I do not know what the department  will  say,  but  I  understand  that  the
department will be making its decision known on this matter quite shortly.

In the amendments to the National Environmental Management Act,  Chapter  5,
which  I  will  be  tabling  shortly,  I  intend  to  address  some  of  the
shortcomings in the EIA system that  exist  presently.  Amongst  others,  we
will enable Government to charge a moderate fee for the processing of  EIAs.
We will establish a professional body  of  EIA  practitioners.  One  of  the
difficulties we have had since the introduction of NEMA is  that  all  sorts
of people  have  posed  as  environmental  experts  and  this  will  now  be
regulated in some way or another.

We will allow for the delegation of certain EIA functions to  municipalities
which have the capacity to administer them, and we will revise  the  overall
allocation of EIA functions between the three  spheres  of  government,  now
that we have quite a lot of experience in this field. We  are  also  backing
this up with extensive work  on  training  and  capacity-building,  and  the
installation of a country-wide electronic processing system.

Provinces and national Government also collaborate closely in the fields  of
biodiversity  management  and  conservation.  We  are   similarly   bringing
substantial legislation before this House that will improve  the  system  of
co-operative  governance  in  this  field.  The  Protected  Areas  Bill  was
published for public comment towards the end of 2002,  followed  shortly  by
the Biodiversity Bill and the first NEMA amendment Bill  on  compliance  and
enforcement.

During this period information seminars were held across  the  country,  and
stakeholders were invited to provide written comments. I am now  proud  that
these Bills have finally been tabled in Parliament for the consideration  of
this House and the National Assembly, and of the tremendous amount  of  hard
work on the part of the select committee.

These Bills deal with very important aspects of our heritage.  South  Africa
boasts something like 403 protected areas,  that  is  terrestrial  protected
areas, totalling 6,6 million hectares, which is  about  5,4%  of  the  total
land surface area of the country. Twenty-two of these  protected  areas  are
national parks, and their total area makes up about  53%  of  the  protected
area estate as a whole. A further 14% are state  forests  in  terms  of  the
National Forests Act.

Provinces are responsible for just about 30%  of  South  Africa's  protected
area estate. I asked the department to do some sums in this  regard,  and  I
think the Council will find this information interesting. The South  African
National Parks, which is responsible for 53% of our  protected  areas,  gets
an allocation from Government every year - that  includes  and  this  year's
allocation - in the region of R78 million.  That  is  the  subsidy  that  SA
National Parks gets.

The nine provinces, collectively,  are  then  responsible  for  30%  of  the
protected areas, as opposed to the 53% at national level. For this  30%  the
provinces allocate to the parks authorities in the provinces  R600  million,
as opposed to the R78 million that SA National Parks receives.  This  raises
a number of questions in my  mind.  You  will  recall  that  two  years  ago
Government released a document entitled: A  Bioregional  Approach  to  South
Africa's Protected Areas.

In that document we set a goal of expanding the area under  protection  from
5,4% of the surface area to 8% by the year 2010. In  the  same  document  we
set two further principles for improving the  management  of  our  protected
areas  by  consolidating   the   existing   areas,   where   possible,   and
rationalising their management. I now believe that it  is  time  to  take  a
long, hard look at conservation management in South Africa as  a  whole  and
apply the same principles. I do not believe that we can  afford  the  number
of management agencies we have in South Africa.

Let us not forget that the allocation of powers and functions  to  provinces
was negotiated in the constitution-making process.  At  times,  as  part  of
horse-trading, the final outcome does not in  all  cases  reflect  logic  or
what is in the best interests of the country.  These  were  compromises  the
ANC made with the NP at the time, and the DP. The latter  parties  basically
argued for as long a list of provincial powers as  possible,  regardless  of
whether it made sense or not. Unfortunately, some amongst us now  regard  as
sacrosanct that which came into being because of the attempts  of  apartheid
parties to fragment governance in our country.

Ironically, the New NP and  the  DA,  now  that  they  do  not  control  any
province, have shifted away from arguing for more federalism.  In  practical
terms, can South Africa afford 10 parks boards? Does it  make  sense  for  a
province to spend enormous resources on provincial  parks  for  very  little
gain? There is, of course, nothing unconstitutional about a parks  board  in
each province, but the real disservice to conservation and to  citizens  who
should derive benefits from  parks,  is  the  establishment  of  financially
unstable models. A system which makes conservation  compete  for  provincial
funds, with the glaring health care, education  and  social  welfare  needs,
without any obvious benefits like economic growth and job creation,  is  not
sustainable and will fail.

A situation where the same taxpayer - because, bear in mind,  there  are  no
provincial and national taxpayers; provinces do not  raise  revenue  -  pays
almost eight times more to maintain provincial parks, compared  to  what  he
or she pays to maintain  national  parks.  This  is,  frankly  speaking,  an
unsustainable model for conservation.

Along with our national and  provincial  parks,  the  country's  four  World
Heritage Sites, based in the Western Cape, Gauteng  and  KwaZulu-Natal,  are
among  the  more  important   tourism   attractions.   Our   rich   history,
biodiversity and cultures enabled us to make significant  progress  in  this
regard. We have now submitted proposals for  four  additional  sites.  These
are Mapungubwe in Limpopo, the Vredefort Dome in the Free  State,  the  Cape
Floristic Region in the Western Cape and  once  again  Makapan's  Valley  in
Limpopo.

It is our view that conservation and economic development must  go  hand  in
hand. Our conservation areas, rather than being a burden on taxpayers,  must
contribute to job creation and socioeconomic upliftment if  conservation  is
to have any real future. Our natural heritage must continue to  serve,  also
as a foundation for the tourism industry.

Ever since 1994  we  have  experienced  growth  in  the  tourism  sector,  a
confirmation that our international marketing campaign is  working.  As  the
fastest-growing tourism  destination  in  the  world,  South  Africans  have
indeed become a tourism nation. The World Travel and Tourism Council  is  of
the view that tourism contributes to jobs for about  7%  of  South  Africa's
workforce. The World Tourism Organisation projects that by 2011 the  tourism
industry will contribute 11% to the global  GDP,  and  account  for  19%  of
total employment, which will be more than 260 million.

This should make us, as a country, want to  regard  the  present  growth  in
tourism as the start of what is possible. What is  really  possible  is  for
travel and tourism in South  Africa  to  contribute  at  least  12%  to  the
country's GDP, and that  should  be  the  aim  that  we  should  be  working
towards.

I reported last year that Minmec has agreed that the annual  celebration  of
World Tourism Day on 27 September must  rotate  among  provinces.  Following
celebrations  which  were  hosted  by  the  Eastern  Cape   in   2001,   and
celebrations held at Bakgatla Village in the North West last year,  we  will
this year observe World Tourism Day in  the  Northern  Cape.  Provinces  are
again encouraged to join national Government in  celebrating  our  successes
and gains  in  tourism  during  tourism  month  by  organising  celebrations
throughout the month in their localities -  celebrations  aimed  at  raising
awareness and sharing information with the public.

Another important area of co-operation  with  provinces  is  around  coastal
management. This year I still hope  to  table  legislation  which,  for  the
first time, introduces a comprehensive  system  of  co-operative  governance
for the coast. I would like to express gratitude to the provinces for  their
assistance presently with the management of our  coastline  on  a  delegated
basis,  and  their  contributions  to  the  functions  of   compliance   and
enforcement.

Greater stability, transformation and growth can  now  be  observed  in  our
fishing sector. Even sceptics are  starting  to  realise  that  it  is  only
Government's carefully  constructed  allocation  system  that  will  provide
sustainable livelihoods for all in  this  sector.  In  fact,  today  we  are
envied around the world for our extremely well-managed marine resources.  We
are also proud of the fact  that  not  a  single  foreign  country  now  has
permits to fish in our waters. [Applause.]
During the apartheid era the total allowable catch for the biggest  fishery,
the hake trawl sector, was divided among  only  six  white-owned  companies.
Today 73% of rights holders are majority black-owned. I must say  that  this
does not translate to 73% of the total allowable catch, because many of  the
majority black-owned companies are much smaller than the  bigger  companies.
But this is a general trend in most fisheries,  and  we  will  be  extending
this work into a number of new fisheries this year, including squid.

We will restructure the system of  abalone  rights  in  order  to  put  this
valuable resource more directly into the  hands  of  local  communities.  We
will also extend our work on subsistence fishing this year to bring  further
benefits to coastal communities, particularly women.

As I indicated in our debate last year,  the  illegal  poaching  of  abalone
continues to be a major concern. I am, of course, happy that over  the  past
few months there has been a major crackdown on trespassers  in  this  sector
through a partnership between the Department of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, the Department of Justice, the SAPS, the SANDF, the  Scorpions  and
other special operations units. We have started  to  break  down  syndicates
that have  been  the  cause  of  the  unjustified  plunder  of  our  natural
resources.

As you are aware, South Africa's very first Environmental Court  is  now  up
and running and functioning in Hermanus, aimed largely at poachers.  Members
of the Council should be told,  perhaps,  that  according  to  the  head  of
prosecutions in the Western Cape, Frank Kahn, this is  not  only  the  first
Environmental Court in the country, but is in fact the first  court  of  its
kind in the world. [Applause.]

You would remember the conviction of Hout Bay Fisheries and the R40  million
fine that was imposed, which made legal history in the  judicial  system  in
this country; and last year, also, the  fining  of  a  foreign  vessel,  the
Golden Eagle, of half a million rand. All of  this  indicates  that  we  are
getting on top of the monitoring and surveillance challenge.

The tide has turned. We are together making the environmental,  tourism  and
fishing  sectors  deliver  real  and  tangible  benefits   to   people   and
communities across  the  country.  At  the  same  time  we  are  building  a
patriotism and unity around these areas of our work that are  truly  helping
and contributing towards building our nation. We are determined to  succeed,
and succeed we will.

 I would like to again report to the NCOP that this country has a  dedicated
team of MECs for environment and tourism. They are women and men who do  not
hesitate  to  challenge  national  Government  in  the  interests  of  their
provinces, and each one has always  placed  the  interests  of  the  country
first. It is a team I have received  co-operation  from,  and  one  I  truly
enjoy working with.

My thanks also to the team in the Ministry, in the  department  and  in  the
institutions linked to the department for their dedication  and  patriotism.
Thank you very much also to Rev Moatshe and members of the select  committee
for your support and  dedication.  I  look  forward  to  working  with  you,
particularly on the processing of the important pieces of  legislation  that
we have this year, and hope that I can rely on the  same  level  of  support
and dedication that you have always shown. Thank you. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Minister, you are the tiger  of  our  forests,  mountains
and valleys. You have  the  capacity  to  do  the  running  backed  by  your
department. I am talking now on behalf of the select committee  that  enjoys
working with you. You give us joy and happiness at all times.

I also want, in particular, to speak of Francois Rogers in your  office.  He
is a sharp, dedicated young man who responds any time, night or day.  Thanks
also to the DG, his deputy and their team at all levels  of  responsibility.
[Applause.]

We also want to take this opportunity to thank the MECs from  the  provinces
and chairpersons of standing committees that  co-operate  promptly  whenever
we interact and communicate with them. I want to thank the members  of  this
House. I would love to conclude by saying, Minister, you have set  the  pace
for this Budget Vote. You have said it all. We just have to  fill  the  gaps
here and there.

In the Scriptures, in the Book of Genesis, it  says  that  God  created  all
things. He created the trees, the vegetation, the  mountains,  the  fish  in
the waters, the birds in the air and the animals,  the  big  five.  He  then
said, ``You shall rule over them and conserve them.'' [Interjections.]

The right to a clean environment and sustainable development is  fundamental
and closely connected to the right to  health  and  wellbeing.  There  is  a
strong connection between the quality of the environment and the  health  of
the people living in and/or exposed to those environments.

The responsibility for the provision of a safe and  healthy  environment  is
outlined in a range of legislation and in  the  different  sections  of  the
Constitution. Section 24 of the Constitution provides that:


  Everyone has the right -


  (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health  or  wellbeing;
       and


  (b) to have the environment protected, for the  benefit  of  present  and
       future generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures
       that -


     (i)    prevent pollution and ecological degradation;


     (ii)   promote conservation; and


     (iii)  secure ecologically sustainable development and use  of  natural
           resources  while  promoting  justifiable  economic  and   social
           development.

The Constitution further places an obligation in terms of section  152(1)(b)
and (d) on the part of local government as stipulated  in  sections  4(2)(d)
and 4(2)(i), and 73(1) and (2) of the  Municipal  Systems  Act,  Act  32  of
2000, to ensure that the  right  to  a  clean  and  healthy  environment  is
fulfilled.

One of the greatest challenges facing South  Africa  and  the  rest  of  the
world is to improve the quality of human life for both the present  and  the
future generations through sustainable development. The  principles  of  the
sustainability of the environment encompass the notion of  intergenerational
equity. The harm to the environment affects the  present,  as  well  as  the
future generations.

In order  to  attain  the  principles  outlined  in  the  Constitution,  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has made great  advances  in
attempting to ensure that the right to improve the  quality  of  human  life
for  both  the  present  and   future   generations,   through   sustainable
development, is attainable. This paper  will  provide  an  overview  of  the
functions of the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,  the
programmes and projects undertaken, and its expenditure trends.

Ek kom nou by die strategiese oorsig  en  noodsaaklike  beleidsontwikkeling.
Die algehele visie van die Departement van Omgewingsake en  Toerisme  is  om
'n beter toekoms vir alle Suid-Afrikaners deur middel van groei in  toerisme
en die effektiewe  bestuur  en  beskerming  van  die  land  se  omgewing  te
verseker.

Die  Departement  van  Handel  en  Nywerheid  bestuur  die  ontwikkeling  en
implementering van beleid wat drie ingeskakelde komponente  van  Suid-Afrika
se sosio-ekonomiese ontwikkeling beheer, naamlik toerisme, die visbedryf  en
die bestuur van omgewingsake.  Die  departement  probeer  verseker  dat  die
potensiaal vir ekonomiese groei binne hierdie drie  sektore  gemaksimaliseer
word. Die balans tussen omgewingsbewaring en ontwikkeling  word  beheer,  en
waar moontlik ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[I now come to the strategic overview and essential policy development.  The
overall vision of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is  to
ensure a better future for all South Africans by means of growth in  tourism
and the effective management  and  protection  of  the  environment  of  the
country.

The  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  manages   the   development   and

socioeconomic development of  South  Africa,  namely  tourism,  the  fishing
industry and the management of environmental affairs. The  department  tries
to ensure that the potential for economic growth within these three  sectors
is maximalised. The balance between the conservation and development of  the
environment is controlled, and where possible ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  There  is  no
interpretation. I am not too sure what is happening.  Can  the  interpreters
please interpret for us? Continue, Rev Moatshe.

Rev P MOATSHE: Deputy Chairperson, from where should I continue?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  From  where  you
stopped. [Laughter.]

Rev P MOATSHE: From where I stopped?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Yes.

Eerw P  MOATSHE:  Die  Departement  van  Handel  en  Nywerheid  bestuur  die
ontwikkeling en implementering van beleid wat drie  ingeskakelde  komponente
van Suid-Afrika se sosio-ekonomiese ontwikkeling beheer,  naamlik  toerisme,
die visbedryf en die  bestuur  van  omgewingsake.  Die  departement  probeer
verseker dat die potensiaal vir ekonomiese groei binne hierdie drie  sektore
gemaksimaliseer word. Die balans tussen  omgewingsbewaring  en  ontwikkeling
word bestuur, en  waar  moontlik,  word  ontwikkeling  in  toerisme  en  die
visbedryf, en omgewingsbewaring beheer sodat hulle mekaar  komplementeer  en
ekonomiese groei stimuleer.

Die  volgehoue  pogings  om  Suid-Afrika  internasionaal   te   bemark   het
merkwaardige groei in hierdie sektor teweeg gebring. Bygesê, as  gevolg  van
die   armoedeverligtingsfonds,   is   meer   as   R232 miljoen   bestee   op
toerismeprojekte, die ontwikkeling van  infrastrukture  en  produkte  regoor
die land. Daar word intensief gekyk na projekte om die toerismebedryf  beide
op plaaslike en nasionale vlak te ontwikkel. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die  Wet  op  Lewende  Mariene  Hulpbronne  bevat  breë  wetgewing  op   die
visserybedryf. Die kwotaproses in die visbedryf is hergestruktureer,  terwyl
transformasie in die bedryf ontwikkeling toon. Drie en sewentig persent  van
alle permitte in die stokvissektor is byvoorbeeld grootliks in swart  besit.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Rev  P  MOATSHE:  The  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry   manages   the
development and implementation of  policy  that  controls  three  interwoven
components  of  the  socioeconomic  development  of  South  Africa,   namely
tourism, the fishing industry and the management of  environmental  affairs.
The department tries to  ensure  that  the  potential  for  economic  growth
within  these  three  sectors  is  maximalised.  The  balance  between   the
conservation and development of the environment  is  controlled  and,  where
possible, the development of tourism  and  the  fishing  industry,  and  the
conservation of the environment are controlled so that they  complement  one
another and stimulate economic growth.

The sustained efforts to market South Africa  internationally  have  brought
about remarkable growth in this sector. In addition,  as  a  result  of  the
poverty relief fund more than R232 million was spent  on  tourism  projects,
the development of infrastructure and products right across the country.  An
in-depth look is being taken at  projects  that  will  develop  the  tourism
industry at both the local and national levels. [Interjections.]

The Marine Living Resources Act  contains  comprehensive  legislation  about
the fishing industry. The quota process in the  fishing  industry  has  been
restructured,  while  transformation  in  the  industry  shows  development.
Seventy-three percent of all permits in the hake sector,  for  example,  are
largely in black possession.]

Two new Bills, namely the National Environmental Management Protected  Areas
Bill and  the  National  Environmental  Management  Biodiversity  Bill  will
ensure  the  proper   management   and   utilisation   of   South   Africa's
biodiversity. The World Summmit on Sustainable Development, or  WSSD,  which
was successfully hosted in 2002, highlighted the country's ability  to  take
up   the   challenge   of   integrating   socioeconomic   development   with
environmental protection.

The achievements of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  for
2002 can be summarised as follows: the WSSD; transformation in  the  fishing
industry; the launch of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier  Park;  negotiations
for a once-off sale of our ivory stockpile; the  translocation  of  game  to
Mozambique, and the sale of plastic bags to carry groceries from our  shops.
This law ensures that plastic bags will not be  disposed  of  all  over  our
country, because each bag costs forty-something cents. [Laughter.]

In order to effect greater transformation in the  industry,  the  department
intends  to,  firstly,  use  information  technology  to   improve   service
delivery; secondly, empower South Africans to participate in  protection  of
the environment and  tourism  through  networking,  outreach  and  strategic
partnerships and thirdly, promote economic  improvement,  job  creation  and
poverty eradication.

Fourthly, the department intends to ensure the practise of  good  governance
within the department, and  fifthly  to  promote  transformation  and  black
economic empowerment, or BEE,  in  the  fishing,  tourism  and  conservation
sectors. The department is of the view that the  DEAT  is  leading  the  BEE
process in the fishing industry, and that it has achieved great  success  in
effecting transformation in this sector.

[With regard to expenditure trends, expenditure in  1999  was  R506  million
and there was an increase of 40,4%, bringing it to R1,4 billion in  2002-03.
These increases are caused by the budgets which were supposed  to  alleviate
or reduce poverty, and to have fishing vessels  and  transfers  to  entities
such as section 21 companies, as at  the  world  summit  that  was  held  in
Johannesburg, the WSSD.

Although expenditure is forecast to rise in the 2003-04 financial  year,  it
is expected to fall over the following two years. The  reason  for  this  is
that poverty relief  programmes  should  stop  receiving  funding  from  the
department.]

I am not sure whether this research is correct, and that we  are  envisaging
a cessation of poverty  alleviation  ...  [Interjections.]  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  However,  I  must
congratulate Mr Moatshe on the fact that he can  speak  so  many  languages;
that is a pride that we have in South  Africa  ...  [Applause.]  I  hope  Mr
Gelderblom will be able to close the gap. [Laughter.]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Chair,  I  will  attempt  to  give  you  a
glimpse of the essentials, as  we  see  it,  of  environmental  affairs  and
tourism in the Western Cape. We have benefited in the  past  year  from  the
amalgamation  of  environmental  affairs,  which  is   combined   with   the
directorate of pollution and waste management and the chief  directorate  of
development planning.

Tourism is booming in the Western Cape, and in many other  regions.  At  the
same time, many more  people  are  becoming  aware  of  their  environmental
rights in terms of the Constitution.  The  number  of  environmental  impact
assessments, or EIAs, reaching the department has tripled in  the  past  two
years from 70 to about 220 a month.

The number of development planning applications  is  nearing  a  thousand  a
year. Obviously, with more input in both sections, the number of  objections
filed with the department  about  ecosensitive  activities  climbs  rapidly.
This has led to the  creation  of  new  products,  such  as  checklists  and
guidelines to improve service delivery.  We  are  quite  proud  of  our  EIA
application form and scoping checklist, and we  are  liaising  closely  with
the  national  department  on  the   requirements   for   off-road   vehicle
regulations and fee structures for boat-launching sites.

I am delighted to share with you the tourism activities we  have  undertaken
over the past six months. As a province we have adopted a balanced  approach
to tourism management. We realise  that  we  should  be  investing  more  in
marketing, so that we can have more people  coming  to  our  province,  thus
stimulating new demands for new products.

We believe we also need to invest in building the capacity of newcomers  and
strengthening existing businesses so that they can cater for the needs of  a
rapidly  growing  market.  Most  importantly,  we  hope   to   lobby   other
departments and entities to invest in infrastructure that  will  unlock  the
economic development potential of previously  marginalised  individuals  and
groups.

The lack of a tourism culture,  access  to  markets,  finance,  information,
skills and training remain obstacles to people who  were  formerly  excluded
from the sector. In this respect, the special focus  has  been  on  our  new
destination marketing organisation,  or  DMO,  small  business  support  and
black economic  empowerment,  tourism  safety  and  security  and  the  Cape
Agulhas project.

Ek is bly om u te kan meedeel dat genoegsame  konsensus  tussen  provinsiale
en  plaaslike  regering  bereik  is  om   'n   enkele   toeristebestemmings-
bemarkingsorganisasie vir Kaapstad en die Wes-Kaap tot stand te  bring.  Die
voorgestelde toeristebemarkingsorganisasie vereis  dat  bestaande  wetgewing
in ons provinsie vervang moet word. Hierdie proses sal 'n paar  maande  neem
om gefinaliseer te word, maar ons teikendatum bly voor einde 2003.

Die aanwysing van raadslede sal afhang  van  aspekte  soos  kennis  van  die
toerismebedryf, transformasie  en  verteenwoordiging,  bemarkingskundigheid,
verteenwoordiging van toerisme-bedryfsassosiasies en  die  vermoë  om  sterk
leierskap  te  openbaar.  Verder  gaan  ons  die  bemarking  van   opkomende
entrepreneurs  integreer  in  ons  bemarkingstrategie  met  nuwe   produkte.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I am glad to be able to tell you that adequate consensus has  been  reached
between provincial and  local  government  to  establish  a  single  tourism
destination marketing organisation for Cape Town and the Western  Cape.  The
proposed tourism marketing organisation requires that  existing  legislation
in our province should be replaced. This process will take a few  months  to
finalise, but our target date remains before the end of 2003.

The appointment of councillors will depend on factors such as  knowledge  of
the  tourism  industry,   transformation   and   representation,   marketing
expertise, representation of tourism industry associations and  the  ability
to display strong  leadership  capability.  Furthermore,  we  are  going  to
integrate  the  marketing  of  emerging  entrepreneurs  into  our  marketing
strategy by means of new products.]

As provincial government, our ultimate objective is to transform the  sector
in order  to  ensure  increased  access  and  representation  by  previously
excluded groups.

We also have other objectives, which are to  grow  existing  businesses  and
increase the number of tourism enterprises and, most  importantly,  increase
innovation in the tourism sector.

We know that while transformation and  democracy  have  removed  the  racial
barriers to participation in tourism, the  previously  disadvantaged  people
of the country are not represented on a significant scale in the  sector  as
mainstream participants in the capacity as owners, managers and operators.

For example, we register tourist guides, and to date we  have  more  than  2
500 tourist guides on our books, and only  13%  are  from  the  marginalised
communities. That is not acceptable for me as  Minister  in  this  province.
But, I can also tell you Minister, that since this new government  has  been
in place in the Western Cape, we have had more than 400 trained; and of  the
400, 196 are from the previously disadvantaged communities. [Applause.]

Research  indicates  that  the  issues  of  safety,  security  and  negative
perceptions are major determinants when  tourists  select  destinations.  We
have developed a  tourism  safety  management  plan,  in  consultation  with
representatives of the tourism industry and law enforcement agencies in  the
province. With short, medium and long-term interventions we aim  to  prevent
and manage crime, rather than having to deal with the aftermath  of  attacks
on tourists. My department has put in place  a  crisis  communication  plan,
which has clear proactive and reactive programmes  to  manage  safety.  This
serves as a  platform  for  the  overall  tourism  safety  strategy  and  is
supported by the existence of the multisector crises communication team.  In
other words, we want to advise product owners on  what  to  do  and  who  to
contact when problems arise.

We have also put in place a victim support programme,  which  covers  issues
such as media liaison,  contact  with  the  embassies,  medical  assistance,
linkage to the criminal justice system and support for family and  partners.
We also have a very good relationship with the South African Police  in  the
Western Cape, also due to the new government, of course.

A high-profile conference on tourism safety  is  planned  in  Cape  Town  in
October, to allow the province to  exchange  ideas  on  best  practices  and
obtain knowledge from countries that have faced and overcome  similar  odds.
That will be in close co-operation with the national Government.

We have identified the Cape Agulhas area as one of the most unique  features
of the province because of its location at the Southern most tip of  Africa.
To capitalise on its strength, the department has appointed a consortium  of
consultants who will develop an  integrated  tourism  development  framework
for Cape Agulhas.

The ultimate objective is to position Agulhas not only as an  icon  for  the
province, but also a national and a continental icon. We hope  to  highlight
the Africanness of  the  province,  and  contribute  towards  promoting  the
objectives of Nepad.

In addition to  the  above-mentioned  projects,  we  are  also  involved  in
implementing programmes, as indicated in the integrated tourism  development
framework. Together with the City of Cape Town, we are identifying sites  of
cultural, historical and  environmental  significance  on  the  Cape  Flats.
Proper interpretative signage will be researched  and  developed  for  these
sites.

Ons is ook baie sterk daarop ingestel om landelike toerisme te bevorder.  Ek
wil ook vandag vir u noem dat ons in die Karoo die Pont  naby  Prins  Albert
baie sterk prioriteit gee,  omdat  dit  nuwe  toeriste-weë  kan  open.  Baie
dankie ook voorlopig, Minister, vir u en u departement se steuning.

Ek wil ook namens die Wes-Kaap dankie  sê  vir  die  direkteur-generaal,  sy
ondersteuning en sy harde werk en die goeie samewerking wat  my  departement
van hom kry. Minister, u kan trots wees op die  direkteur-generaal  wat  ons
vandag het. Baie dankie. [Applous.]

Minister, ek weet nie of mev Cheryl Carolus hier is nie,  maar  ons  in  die
Wes-Kaap wil vandag sê ons is op haar baie,  baie  trots.  Die  Wes-Kaap  en
Suid-Afrika kan trots wees om só 'n bemarker te hê van die mooiste bron  wat
ons in die Wes-Kaap het - toerisme. [Applous.]

En dan kom ek by minister Valli Moosa. Ek skuld die  Minister  niks  nie  en
die Minister skuld my niks nie, maar ek wil vandag vir u sê dat dit  vir  my
'n wonderlike voorreg is om saam te werk met 'n persoon van integriteit,  'n
persoon wat 'n oopdeurbeleid volg en 'n persoon wat altyd tyd het om  na  'n
mens te luister as jy hom skakel of as jy by hom 'n  draai  maak.  Minister,
baie, baie dankie vir die wyse waarop u toerisme in  hierdie  land  vorentoe
neem. Ek wil u verseker, ek en die Wes-Kaap staan by u, en ons sal  die  pad
saam  met  u  loop.  Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[We are also very strongly set on promoting rural tourism. I  also  want  to
mention to you today that we in the Karoo are affording the Pont near  Prins
Albert very strong priority, because it can  open  up  new  tourism  routes.
Thank you very much also  for  the  moment,  Minister,  for  your  and  your
department's support.

I also want to say thank you on behalf of the Western Cape to the  director-
general, and for his support and his hard work  and  the  good  co-operation
that my department gets  from  him.  Minister,  you  can  be  proud  of  the
director-general that we have today. Thank you. [Applause.]

Minister, I do not know whether Mrs Cheryl Carolus is here, but  we  in  the
Western Cape just want to say today that we are very,  very  proud  of  her.
The Western Cape and South Africa can be proud to have such  a  marketer  of
the finest resource that we have in the Western Cape - tourism.

And then I come to Minister Valli Moosa. I owe  the  Minister  nothing,  and
the Minister owes me nothing, but I want to say to you today that  it  is  a
wonderful privilege for me to work with a person of integrity, a person  who
follows an open door policy and a person who always has the time  to  listen
to one when one rings him or visits him.  Minister,  thank  you  very,  very
much for the way in which you are taking tourism in this country forward.  I
want to give you the assurance that the Western Cape and I stand by you  and
we will walk the distance with you. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, it is indeed a  privilege  to  participate  in
this debate. We have just received gifts,  and  it  looks  like  a  recycled
product, but I do not know what the value of this  product  is,  because  we
have to declare our gifts. So, hon Minister, in future just put a price  tag
on it as well. But we appreciate it. [Laughter.]

We in the Northern Cape recognise  that  the  spectre  of  unemployment  and
poverty looms large. We have implemented a range of programmes and  measures
targeted at poverty alleviation; job creation is ultimately the  best  means
to this end. The promotion of economic growth  and  development,  therefore,
remains one  of  the  short,  medium  and  long-term  priorities  of  local,
provincial and national Government. We must be mindful of the fact that  our
hard-won democracy will only truly be entrenched when the majority of  South
Africans are freed from the yoke of poverty.

In  the  Northern  Cape  province,  we  explicitly  recognise   the   inter-
relatedness  of  the  performance  of  our  economy  and  the  socioeconomic
conditions under which large parts of our  population  live.  We  understand
that we need to forge partnerships and strategic alliances if we are to  put
our provincial economy back on a positive  growth  path.  Consequently,  the
promotion of economic growth and development remains a central challenge  of
the Government that aspires to achieve a better life for all.

Through what has been an extensive and ongoing  programme  of  research,  we
have identified in a significant number of projects  level  economic  growth
opportunities that  could  provide  the  impetus  for  the  new  growth  and
development.

While the Northern Cape provincial economy remains  heavily  dependent  upon
minerals and agricultural sectors as a source of livelihood for our  people,
we are actively pursuing prospects for growth in  new  industries,  such  as
tourism  and  mariculture,  to  provide  the  basis  for   new   sustainable
livelihoods in the Northern Cape.

In tourism, a number of major  new  ecotourism-orientated  initiatives  have
convinced me of the growth  potential  of  tourism  in  the  Northern  Cape.
Firstly, the development of the three transfrontier parks  in  the  province
on the shared borders with Botswana and Namibia looks set to  give  a  much-
needed  impetus  to  tourism  development  in  the  province.  Already   the
proclamation of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in 1999 has  been  followed
by new investments on the part of the SA National Parks in the area.

Later this year the final international agreements will  be  signed  between
South  Africa  and  Namibia,  that  will   bring   the   Ai-Ais-Richtersveld
Transfrontier Conservation Park into being. Moves are  also  afoot  for  the
provincial government to lead a process  that  will  see  the  Orange  River
Mouth Ramsar site proclaimed a  provincial  protected  area.  In  all  three
cases, transfrontier status will enhance levels of awareness of these world-
class tourism destinations.

Our challenge, in addition to marketing and promotion,  is  to  be  able  to
prepare business to be able to take advantage of new business  opportunities
that arise as a result of these developments. In  the  rural  areas  of  the
Northern Cape, these transfrontier developments would  seem  to  have  great
potential to contribute to the economic development of remote  rural  areas,
and the upliftment of disadvantaged people.

Clearly this is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. However, I  am
concerned that the scope for these developments to  attract  investment  and
to create new jobs will diminish unless we give this  matter  more  explicit
consideration. To reinforce the point that I am making, I  cannot  find  any
published data even estimating the number of jobs that the Kgalagadi and Ai-
Ais-Richtersveld  parks  might  create.  This   is   a   serious   omission,
particularly when the same sources can tell me how many  bird  species  will
be protected, or how many biomes will be conserved, etc.

As a source of economic growth, fishing in the Northern  Cape  has  declined
in the past 20 to 30 years to the point where current quota allocations  are
insufficient to sustain the  livelihoods  of  those  individuals  that  were
previously active participants in this industry, and  the  existing  fishing
and fish processing infrastructure. This decline has been  acutely  felt  in
the poor and impoverished coastal communities, especially in Namaqualand  in
the Port Nolloth area.

Nevertheless, we have identified  a  few  opportunities  to  rejuvenate  the
industry in the province through a few targeted interventions. We  are  also
currently partnering your department, Minister,  in  a  small-scale  fishing
experiment that seeks to prove ecological and economic sustainability of  an
in-shore fishery, targeting certain nonquota species as a  means  to  create
new opportunities in the industry. We are also engaged with your  department
in soliciting your support for a number of  regional  fishery  interventions
designed to get more out of the existing hake and west  coast  rock  lobster
fisheries. In so doing, we recognise that the scope for growth in the  local
fishing industry is limited, but if we can just recreate  opportunities  for
many of those formerly involved  in  the  industry  and  get  existing  fish
processing facilities functioning again, we  will  have  achieved  something
significant.

Mariculture, or  the  farming  of  marine  organisms,  is  a  global  growth
industry fuelled by the  fact  that  natural  fish  stocks  are  essentially
maximised in terms of their  sustainable  exploitation.  Although  it  is  a
relatively new economic sector, it displays enormous  potential  for  growth
along the Northern Cape province's Namaqualand coast, particularly  when  it
involves the  cultivation  of  high-value  species  for  export.  Favourable
biological conditions, excellent shore-based  infrastructure,  the  presence
of a number of pioneer private sector mariculturists and a  strong  research
and development base, offer an ideal environment for investment  and  growth
in this industry.

For some time now the provincial department of economic affairs and  tourism
has been researching the prospects for growth in this sector,  and  has  now
identified a portfolio of projects for which investment partners  are  being
actively  solicited.  Key  amongst  these  is   the   flagship   Namaqualand
Mariculture Industrial Park. It entails the development of a  clustered  set
of complementary mariculture activities, sharing common  infrastructure  and
technical and business development support services on the site  within  the
Richtersveld municipal area.

In our estimation, this  project,  together  with  a  portfolio  of  related
mariculture  projects  with  a   special   capital   development   cost   of
R150 million, could create between 500 and 700 jobs over the next  three  to
five years. For some of you that may not sound like very much,  but  in  the
impoverished  and  small  coastal   communities   of   Namaqualand   it   is
significant, particularly in the light  of  the  impending  downscaling  and
closure of the diamond mines over the medium to long-term.

The  Northern  Cape  provincial  government  will,  therefore,  be  actively
promoting this sector into the foreseeable future. However,  yet  again,  we
must forge more effective relationships with your department, hon  Minister,
the Department of Science and Technology and the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry.

I have no doubt about the potential for tourism, fishing and mariculture  to
provide the basis for new economic growth and development opportunities  for
our province. However, if these are to be realised, I believe that  we  need
to achieve better co-ordination through integrated governance.

While each  province  and  each  municipality  needs  to  identify  its  own
economic potentials, I believe that there is considerable scope for  a  more
co-ordinated, more focused and better managed  intergovernmental  programme,
designed to realise growth prospects in the province.

In my view, it is time that we think  more  deeply  about  arranging  public
sector resources around projects and programmes,  instead  of  along  narrow
and sometimes parochial departmental or jurisdictional  interests.  As  much
as we talk co-operation and sit in our cluster committees  at  the  national
and at the provincial level, it is out there on the  ground  where  we  also
need the clustering and collaboration. All  too  frequently,  the  interface
between national and provincial government, in particular, is found  wanting
at an operational level. I suspect that this is often  because  the  project
or programme on which we are supposed to be collaborating is  our  priority,
or that of a local municipality ... [Time expired.] Thank you, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): At  times  I  am  just
trying to be  more  decent  by  switching  your  microphone  off.  You  must
understand your time is over.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chairperson. I am also a member of  the  select
committee, but I cannot remember that I gave Rev Moatshe a mandate to  speak
on my behalf in this Chamber. [Interjections.]

If I look at the ever-increasing budget for tourism  marketing,  I  fail  to
understand why tourism activities related to marine and  coastal  management
are  treated  with  contempt,  ignorance  and  arrogance.   MCM   has   now,
justifiably, been renamed by the public as ``marine and coastal mayhem''.

Allow me to illustrate how insensitive MCM have  been  with  regard  to  the
shark aquarium in Jeffreys Bay, the shark  cage  diving  sector,  the  boat-
based whale watching, as well as the ``vis [fish] favours''  in  Still  Bay.
The shark aquarium is one of the three shark exporters in the world, and  it
is the biggest. They receive approximately 80  000  visitors  per  year,  as
this aquarium is also an educational facility, which, for  example,  has  17
additional shark species that have  no  commercial  value.  The  educational
component also provides lessons on the protection of  the  environment.  All
the South African aquariums, as well as the National Zoo  in  Pretoria,  buy
sharks and rays from this aquarium. Let me refer you to  a  local  newspaper
in Jeffreys Bay, Our Times, of  9  May.  It  featured  a  heading,  ``Unique
facility to boost tourism in Kouga''. Another article of 30 May read:


  A multimillion rand aquarium and sea park, similar to the  world-renowned
  Sea World in San Diego, is being planned for Marina Martinique. The first
  construction is to start at the beginning of July. The stock is  obtained
  from angling from the shore by trained people. Sharks are required to  be
  transferred to a tank filled with sea water and a  life  support  system,
  once it is captured. It also requires a vehicle with a support system  on
  hand. Once in the tanks, the sharks are driven to the holding pools. This
  is done only through one of  the  three  entrance  or  exit  points.  The
  chances of sharks surviving without the aforementioned support  is  zero.
  Access to the beach is about 20 times per year - weather as well as water
  permitting - mostly at night, during summer months, and not in  a  public
  swimming area. Therefore, it is not understandable why this  aquarium  is
  denied access to the beach by vehicle.

Noting at the same time, and I am quoting from  a  letter  from  marine  and
coastal management:


  Kindly note that due to the absence of both an appropriate fee  structure
  and a clear framework to ensure  consistent  processing  of  applications
  across all coastal provinces, permits will not  be  issued  for  research
  activities or tour operations. In the  intervening  period,  the  use  of
  vehicles may only occur by virtue of an  exemption  by  the  Minister  in
  terms of regulation 22.

Surely, there should be some guidelines in place to help these people.

Let me then come to the shark cage and boat-based whale watching.

Wat hulle in gemeen het, is dat daar geen openbare  aankondigings  was  nie.
En ek lees vir u 'n brief voor: [What they have  in  common  is  that  there
were no public announcements. And I shall read to you a letter:]

This is a copy of an e-mail sent to Francois Rogers, at his  request,  after
I had complained to him and Minister Moosa about the runaround I  was  given
by MCM in an attempt to apply for a boat-based whale watching permit  for  a
100% black-owned company.

Op kort kennisgewing is die mense aangesê om hul mondelinge voorleggings  te
doen, wat ontaard het in 'n intimiderende vraesessie deur  die  paneel.  Vyf
maande daarna is daar nog geen permit uitgereik nie. Toe die  bootgebaseerde
walviskykpermitte uiteindelik toegeken is, is die permitte teruggedateer  na
Januarie 2002. Die geldige tydperk van hierdie permitte is dus  verkort  met
16 maande, en as ons iets van  toerisme  af  weet,  sal  ons  weet  dat  die
eindproduk eintlik eers na twee jaar se bemarking in werking tree.

Permitte is toegeken  in  sekere  areas,  sonder  enige  aankondiging,  soos
byvoorbeeld in Struisbaai. By 'n ``prime whale calving area'' soos  De  Hoop
is dit net aangekondig, sonder om in kontak te wees met die  geakkrediteerde
liggaam, SABWA.

Ons beskik oor 'n brief wat mnr Horst Kleinschmidt in 2002  aan  mnr  Bernie
Paulse geskryf het, waarin hy hom belowe het dat dit  nie  weer  sou  gebeur
nie. Desondanks het dit weer gebeur.

Pioniers in die bedryf is uitgelaat, en ek kyk  spesifiek  hier  na  Dr  Vic
Cocroft. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[On  short  notice,  the  people  were  instructed  to   make   their   oral
submissions, which degenerated in an intimidating question  session  by  the
panel. Five months later, not one permit has yet been issued. When the boat-
based whale watching permits were eventually issued, the permits were  back-
dated to January 2002. The valid period of these permits was thus  shortened
by 16 months, and if we know something about tourism, we will know that  the
end-product will only come into effect after two years of marketing.

Permits  were  issued  in  certain  areas,  like  Struisbaai,  without   any
announcement. At a "prime whale calving area", like  De  Hoop  it  was  only
announced, without contacting the accredited body, SABWA.

We are in possession of a letter written by Mr Horst  Kleinschmidt  in  2002
to Mr Bernie Paulse wherein he was promised that it would not happen  again.
In spite of that, it happened again.

Pioneers in the industry were omitted and here I specifically  refer  to  Dr
Vic Cocroft.]

He has been involved in watch watching, both  on  land  and  boat-based,  in
South Africa and internationally. Since 1990 he has been at the  centre  for
dolphin studies, and he has a long history  of  empowerment,  education  and
community programmes.

As ek net kortliks kan verwys na die mense wat ons hier mee te  doen  het  -
ene Mnr Jackie Smit. Ek lees vir u uit 'n brief  van  die  Universiteit  van
Stellenbosch:


  Just a letter of appreciation for the support  you  are  rendering,  both
  financially and logistically, to our shark research project. Without your
  unstinting support, it would not have been possible for us  to  undertake
  regular trips to gather data, without the possibility of approaching  the
  sharks in a safe and professional way, our research cannot be conducted.

Hierdie navorsing is gedoen deur A Reynecke van  die  Departement  Soölogie.
Hierdie proses kon nie voortgaan nie, want  die  proses  is  oorgeneem  deur
mariene- en kusbestuur.

Dan wil ek graag aan u 'n brief voorlees oor  die  probleme  wat  die  mense
ondervind. Dit is 'n brief van White Shark Adventures:


  We have been allocated a permit on 11 June, and have paid  an  amount  of
  R20 000, which we had to borrow for the permit. But to date, we have  not
  received our permit, in spite of promises that we would receive it within
  20 days.

My  tyd  word  min.  Ek  sal  graag  wil  kom  by  die  ``shark  longline''.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If I could just quickly refer to the people with whom we are  dealing  here
- one Mr Jackie Smit. I read to you from a letter  from  the  University  of
Stellenbosch:


  Just a letter of appreciation for the support  you  are  rendering,  both
  financially and logistically, to our shark research project. Without your
  unstinting support, it would not have been possible for us  to  undertake
  regular trips to gather data, without the possibility of approaching  the
  sharks in a safe and professional way, our research cannot be conducted.

This research was done  by  A  Reynecke  of  the  Department  Zoology.  This
process could not continue because the process were  taken  over  by  marine
and coastal management.

Then I would like to read from a letter about the  problems  experienced  by
the people. It is a letter from White Shark Adventures.]


  We have been allocated a permit on 11 June, and have paid  an  amount  of
  R20 000, which we had to borrow for the permit. But to date, we have  not
  received our permit, in spite of promises that we would receive it within
  20 days.

My time is running out. I would like to get to the shark longline.]

After an in-depth study of the shark  handline  industry  and  documentation
from  marine  and  coastal  management  revealed  the  following  about  the
industry: The argument is that this section is used to augment that of  tuna
fishing and implies ... Chair, I am not going to take a question.

Ms J L KGOALI: Can the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The hon  member  has  already  indicated
that she will not take any question.

Mrs A M VERSFELD: ... to augment that  of  tuna  fishing  and  implies  that
shark catchers are marginal. However, shark  longline  directed  catches  in
2001 totalled 127kg. SARS statistics for the  import  and  export  of  dried
shark fin indicate that  the  following  minimum  harvesting  of  shark  was
required to achieve 73kg of shark fin. To be able to achieve that, you  need
to catch 11 286 kg. Shark by-catch for all the vessels and all  the  permits
as provided by MCM did not account for this incredible discrepancy.

The  minimum  unrecorded  shark  harvest  is  therefore  as  follows:  Shark
harvest,  11  000;  shark  direct,  127;  shark  by-catch,  110   and   then
unrecorded, 11 000. In this case one can suggest massive tax evasion as  the
reason for this  proportionally  low  harvest  of  directed  longline  shark
versus total shark harvested to support the net export  of  the  shark  fin.
That is about one billion rand. [Interjections.]

It is thus unconceivable that  rights  should  be  granted  to  persons  who
clearly do not exercise these rights,  or  who  exercise  them  but  do  not
fulfil  their  statutory  obligations  by  not  submitting  the   obligatory
information to MCM, yet  they  all  got  their  permits.  According  to  the
fishery policy on shark longline fishing, I would like to quote:


  More recently,  2002,  however,  the  interest  in  shark  has  increased
  dramatically, target species are the soup fin and the hound shark.

It is therefore quite  alarming  to  learn  that  this  applicant,  when  he
revealed this information, got a  letter  back  stating  that  it  made  for
interesting reading matter and would be considered in the next  legislation.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I am reminded that  I  won't  be  around  next
week - meaning that I am not going to participate in all  the  debates.  You
might want to be generous and extend my speaking time. [Laughter.]

Modulasetilo, Bakhuduthamaga ba le  babedi  ba  kwa  Bokone  Bophirima,  Mme
Maureen Modiselle wa tsa Bojanala le Mme Edna Molewa wa tsa Tikologo  ga  ba

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, two MECs from the North West,  Ms  Maureen  Modiselle  of  the
department of tourism and Ms Edna Molewa of the department of  environmental
affairs could not be with us today because the  North  West  province  needs
them. It appears that they have other commitments. As the  relevant  person,
they asked me to convey apologies on their behalf.]

I also want to refresh the  memory  of  Mrs  Versveld.  She  seems  to  have
forgotten  that  Rev  Moatshe  is  the  chairperson  of  this  committee,  a
committee of which she is a member. The chairperson  of  the  committee  can
speak on its behalf. I think that this is not  only  happening  in  the  ANC
where one has this kind of nice  arrangement.  I  think  other  parties,  in
other countries, might have a similar arrangement.  The  only  problem  here
might be the DA, which might want to come with  an  arrangement  which  does
not exist on planet earth. It might exist somewhere, maybe on Mars.  I  know
that people are going to Mars; they might want to tell us what is  happening
up there.

Tourism in our province, in particular, and at a national level, is  growing
at a phenomenal rate. In our province, for  example,  international  visitor
arrival grew from over 347 000 in 2001 to over 600 000 in  2002.  Obviously,
this is a percentage of  growth  of  more  than  50%.  What  a  nice  thing.
Secondly, from this growth,  our  people  have  benefited  significantly.  A
substantial number of jobs has been created, both direct and indirect, as  a
result of the growth I have just spoken about.

In 1994, a total of 67 000 jobs were created, in 1999 117 000  were  created
and in 2000 207 000 jobs were created  due  to  this  growth.  Members  will
agree with that this is something which is  very  good,  not  only  for  the
province, but for the country as a whole. As the  North  West  province,  we
want to advance to the Minister and  the  department  that  province  has  a
significant role to play in the advancement of tourism in  our  country.  It
is one of the most important provinces that need  to  play  that  role.  Not
only that province, but all of us have a responsibility to  promote  tourism
amongst the indigenous people. We have that responsibility. It is  not  nice
when you go to Guguletu and find that people there know nothing about  Table
Mountain. If you go to an area called Mabeleapodi,  in  North  West,  people
there know nothing about the Pilanesberg. We need to ensure that we  promote
tourism amongst our people.

Therefore, our province has undertaken to  do,  amongst  other  things,  the
following: firstly, to educate  our  people  about  the  value  of  tourism;
secondly, to ensure that there are opportunities for  indigenous  people  to
experience the joys of travelling, for example from North  West  to  Gauteng
and from Gauteng to the Northern Cape, etc - our province  is  going  to  do
that; and thirdly, to create more opportunities for communities  to  benefit
economically from tourism. One of the key things which  is  very  important,
and I think if Comrade Kader is listening he will also agree with me, is  to
engage educational  institutions  in  fostering  a  love  and  knowledge  of
tourism, and to provide tourism facilities  at  affordable  rates  to  local
communities. This is what the province  of  the  North  West,  the  platinum
province, is working on.

We have brought to the attention of local government  structures  that  they
need  to  be  fully  involved  in  educating  local  communities  about  the
importance of tourism. Our strong  and  unshakable  opinion  is  that  local
government must assist in conducting or commissioning  research  into  local
history and culture - this is very important - with a view  to  making  them
accessible in a comprehensive format. We need to document that  history  and
culture as local government, and ensure that, at the  end  of  the  day,  as
people come to our provinces, and localities, they know  what  is  happening
there. We might not only want to concentrate on where we are; we might  want
to circulate that information in other provinces like the Northern Cape  and
Gauteng.

The other thing which they might want to do is to sponsor annual  historical
and cultural events that  seek  to  highlight  local  history,  culture  and
values. Like I said before, the other thing which  they  might  want  to  go
further with, is to package local culture such as crafts,  music  and  dance
for the tourism market. I know ``muruti''  [the  Reverend]  is  thankful.  I
have no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  there  is  a  need  for  black  economic
empowerment in tourism. We therefore, as a province, and  I  in  particular,
appreciate the initiatives taken to achieve the said objectives. If we  want
to achieve the said objectives, some of the things which we  might  want  to
do, or which we are already doing, is to appreciate that  there  are  awards
in recognition of emerging tourism businesses. I think that is  encouraging,
and is also assisting in ensuring that our people become  involved  in  this
venture.

 What a wonderful initiative the  tourism  guide  training  partnership  is.
Product development, mentorship, etc - all these  things  are  wonderful.  I
know the chairperson agrees with  me.  [Laughter.]  Through  the  province's
tourism implementation agencies - and I know the Minister spoke about  this,
but I will come to it later - the North West parks  and  tourism  board  has
undertaken to, on a continuous basis, monitor the growth and development  of
SMMEs with PDI status. If I were to quote figures, it might take us  a  very
long time, but they are quite impressive. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, the KZN province prides itself on being  a  top-
class tourism destination in our country as it exemplifies a wide  diversity
of services -  beauty,  tranquillity,  culture  and  history.  Additionally,
there is  across-the-spectrum  co-operation  amongst  all  role-players  and
stakeholders  regarding  our  unity  of  purpose  and  achievement  on  this
endeavour. This was, most likely, the key reason  that  prompted  the  Chief
Executive Officer of SA  Tourism  -  Ms  Cheryl  Carolus,  to  allocate  the
internationally renowned and prestigious tourism indaba to our province  for
another two years.

Throughout  the  years  our  province  has  been  building  the  experience,
expertise and diversity of our nature and resources in order  to  share  our
country's major goal of becoming an  international  leader  in  the  tourism
field. We have studied this diversity  scientifically  and  thoroughly,  and
especially the wide variety of spin-offs emanating from the various  sectors
and services involved in the elevation of tourism as a  major  job  creation
vehicle.  Of  course,  there  have  been  problems,  especially  after   the
implementation of the amendments to the  National  Environmental  Management
Act of 1998, with the banning of 4X4s from beaches.

Research has indicated that over 125 000 mandates were lost to local  people
through this banning, bearing in mind that all these people are the  poorest
of  the  poor.  An  appeal  is  made  to  the  Ministry  to  re-examine  the
amendments, and especially their implementation. Why must we have a  blanket
ban on beaches? Can't we be more innovative and flexible? We  are  proud  of
the historical, cultural and  natural  diversity  of  our  province  at  all
levels,  including  the  so-called  tours,  sporting  events,  international
conferences and a wide variety of other events.

The recently held international ports conference at the  ICC  proved  beyond
doubt the immense potential  of  our  people,  our  natural  resources,  our
infrastructure and our impressive marketing mix  of  uniqueness,  innovation
and united spirit. Tourism is a job creator - a beacon of human hope. We  in
KwaZulu-Natal are determined to create and maintain the  circumstances  that
will galvanise the continuous  process  of  success,  progress,  growth  and
development.

I want to support the hon member, Mr Maloyi's point  that  it  is  important
that the Ministry should begin to think of taking tourism  to  rural  areas,
right into the indigenous areas of our country, so  that  they  realise  the
value of tourism.

Mr M C MOKITLANE (Free State): Chairperson, Minister, MECs present, and  hon
members, I lived in a place called Vredefort,  the  host  to  the  Vredefort
Dome. I was not even aware that the  stone  I  used  to  play  on  had  such
significance in terms of tourism. I also  lived  in  what  was  then  called
Qwaqwa, but now it  is  Maluti-a-Phofung.  For  five  years  I  lived  there
without knowing the Golden Gate Highlands National Park was less  than  30km
away from  me.  And  I  consider  myself,  relative  to  a  portion  of  the
community, to be sophisticated. If I did not know about these  things,  what
about the millions of our people? I think we have a great task  at  hand  to
bring this consciousness to our people. We have to tell them that they  need
time to relax.

In the few years spanning  our  democratic  dispensation,  we  have  seen  a
phenomenal growth of the tourist industry in our country.  At  a  time  when
many countries in the world, including favourite tourist  destinations  like
Australia, are experiencing a decline in tourists, our country continues  to
receive increasing numbers of tourists. Hence tourism has become the  fourth
largest industry in our country, and has also become a  lifeline  for  other
sectors of the economy.

 It has increased employment. The industry itself has created a lot  of  job
opportunities for our people. This sector has  also  led  to  investment  in
other sectors of the economy. As the tourists crisscross our  country,  they
also come to discover that there are business opportunities.  As  a  result,
they come back to invest in our economy.

The Free State is known as a farming area, an area  where  you  have  mines,
particularly gold mines. The Public Service is contributing greatly  to  the
gross geographic product of the province. It is because of this  realisation
that the province has also embarked on a programme that  would  ensure  that
we attract as many tourists as possible to our province. We have  also  made
significant contributions to the growth  of  the  tourism  industry  in  our
country. In the past financial year 75 000 people  visited  the  Free  State
provincial reserves.

Many of the  travellers  who  go  to  favourite  tourist  destinations  like
KwaZulu-Natal and the Cape, inevitably pass through the Free State  and,  as
a result, contribute a lot in terms of revenue in the Free  State.  We  also
have leisure travellers who mostly come from Gauteng. There  are  also  land
travellers, who come from Mozambique and Lesotho, who visit the  Free  State
on a continuous basis. Sometimes those from Lesotho  visit  the  Free  State
more than 10 times a year.

We have also, as a  province,  benefited  from  major  international  events
which have been held in our country, particularly  the  Cricket  World  Cup.
There are currently major  developments  that  are  significantly  going  to
enhance tourism in the province.  In  the  budget  vote  of  the  provincial
department of tourism, environmental and economic affairs, the MEC,  Sakhiwo
Belot, announced the establishment of a tourism authority,  something  which
we have not had over a long period in the  province.  We  believe  that  the
tourism authority will actually assist the province in taking  advantage  of
opportunities offered by our South African tourism.

We have also found out that the MEC is  going  to  establish  an  investment
recruitment agency that will ensure that our  tourist  industry  grows.  The
other development is the granting of two casino licences after a  protracted
process. The two licences will bring forth the establishment of the  casinos
in  the  Matjhabeng  municipality  and  in  Bethlehem   in   the   Dihlabeng
municipality. Bethlehem lies in the eastern part  of  the  Free  State.  The
eastern part of the Free State, with its mountain ranges and scenic  beauty,
has the largest share of the tourism market in the Free State.

Because of its proximity  and  familiarity  to  the  Lesotho  citizens,  the
casino in Bethlehem is going to attract a large number of  day  visitors  to
the province. The development of a more that R60 million game  park  in  the
vicinity of Wepener will also be a major boost to tourism in  the  province.
This game reserve is piloted by the private sector. A number of  events  and
festivals, held annually in the Free State, continue to attract  significant
numbers of tourists to the Free State. The  Phakisa  Motorbike  Grand  Prix,
held in Welkom, attracts a large number  of  riders  from  abroad  and  from
inside the country.
The Mangaung Cultural Festival, the Cherry  Festival  and  the  agricultural
showcase, Nampo, are some of the events that continue to  enjoy  popularity,
and to bring tourists to our province. The promotion of  tourism  among  the
indigenous people of South Africa is a priority.  Our  people  must  not  be
made hewers of wood and drawers of water in  this  industry.  They  must  be
developed into tourists that will savour the beauty  of  their  country  and
attain fulfilment. They must be allowed and trained to carve for  themselves
a business niche in this industry.

They must be assisted in terms of access to funding for the  development  of
SMMEs, which are tourism-based. Already our people have shown  a  resilience
against  the  formidable  challenges  presented   by   this   industry,   by
establishing tour operator businesses, and by achieving  substantial  equity
in the hostel industry, catering and transport. Many have received  training
and accreditation as tour guides, and therefore play an  essential  role  in
tourism. As the tourism industry becomes more and more sophisticated,  there
will be a need to upgrade the quality of training presently given.
More women are establishing B&Bs in formally black  areas,  thus  fulfilling
an important need for  travellers.  Many  B&Bs  are  successful,  and  those
located near places of interest are doing good business.  An  example  would
be those near places like the Kruger National  Park.  In  the  province,  in
Intabazwe in Harrismith, 13 B&Bs were established  to  serve  travellers  to
Durban. These B&Bs are run by women. Local government must  assist  some  of
these businesses with marketing.

Many local authorities in the Free State are  not  doing  enough  to  market
tourist destinations in their  own  localities.  They  are  not  giving  out
information on what is available in  their  own  areas.  Ecotourism  is  one
significant product that helped South Africa  to  have  the  highest  growth
rate last year. It is important, therefore, to preserve our environment  and
natural beauty to ensure that the people can still appreciate  our  country.
The control of waste and prevention of pollution become critical.

The Government's campaign against plastic bags is already yielding  positive
results.  Our  streets  are  now  less  littered  with  plastics   and   the
countryside is beginning to expose its beauty to the passerby. We  must,  as
a country, continue to search for better ways to dispose of the  42  million
cubic metres of general waste we generate each year. As the province of  the
Free State,  our  greatest  concern  should  continue  to  be  the  area  of
Sasolburg, which is our chemical industrial area.  Many  residents  continue
to voice their concern regarding the air pollution.

It is, however, heartening to realise that this  matter  is  also  receiving
attention  from  the  provincial  government.   Local   municipalities   are
compelled by the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention  Act  to  control  various
forms of air pollution, including  poisonous  gases  and  dust.  Control  is
mainly  exercised   through   carefully   setting   requirements   for   the
installation  of  advanced   air   cleaning   equipment.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr A E DE WET (Eastern Cape): Chairperson,  thank  you  very  much  for  the
opportunity. I would like to start by thanking  the  hon  Minister  and  the
department for the transformation that they have initiated in South Africa.

They have resurrected the  status  of  our  true  national  flowers  at  the
expense of the alien invasion of the  plastic  variety.  They  have  largely
normalised and continue  to  normalise  the  participation  in  the  fishing
industry. The hon Minister has acknowledged and recognised the obvious,  the
obvious being the cleanliness of  the  Nelson  Mandela  metropole,  and  the
growing diversity of the support  for  the  ANC,  not  only  in  the  Nelson
Mandela metropole, but throughout the Eastern Cape.

I would like to make a  few  comments  on  the  issues  raised  by  the  hon
Minister. The Minister highlighted the fact that R598 million  is  allocated
to the provinces to manage 30% of the protected area estate.  I  venture  to
say that this may be due to the  inability  of  the  provinces  to  generate
revenue from this asset. This must be seen as  a  direct  challenge  to  the
provinces, and I am pleased to say that the Eastern Cape has taken  up  that
challenge.

We acknowledge  that  the  personnel  of  our  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism are trained and skilled in the care of fauna and  flora.
They know how to look after the animals in our province  and  our  reserves,
but they don't know how to look after the people, and it is the  people  who
generate the revenue.

We have called for private sector  initiatives  and  participation  to  take
over the functions in the Eastern Cape reserves, specifically looking  after
the people and being in a situation to generate revenue. We have  done  this
now for the second time. I must say the first time the response  was  rather
disappointing,  but  the  response  to  our  second  initiative   has   been
outstanding. A very, very  exciting  response  has  come  from  the  private
sector and preferred participants will be announced shortly.

The change in participation in the fishing industry must  be  applauded.  Up
to 60% of quotas are now allocated to companies with  a  majority  of  black
shareholding. We  also  applaud  the  fact  that  40%  of  the  department's
procurement is now directed to BEE companies.

However, hon Minister, I want to suggest that the Government may have to  do
more to realise the benefits to the subsistence fishers.  I  want  to  refer
specifically to the crayfish resource along the Wild Coast  of  the  Eastern
Cape. We still have a situation in which the crayfish is harvested and  sold
to the few cottage owners along the coastline for R4 to  R6.  Many  crayfish
are taken out daily, a lot of them undersized.

I would like to suggest that it is essential  for  Government  to  intervene
and to make the markets available to those fishers. I've often thought  that
with this resource, which is a resource  that  can  survive  away  from  its
natural environment for some time, storage tanks could be erected along  the
Wild Coast, where the harvest of the subsistence fishers could be bought  at
market prices and be redirected to the market.

One may need Government intervention to achieve that. One would  far  rather
see, maybe, five crayfish taken out of the sea  to  generate,  for  example,
R200 or R300. That would be preferable  to  the  situation  at  the  moment,
where one would have 10 crayfish removed from the sea to give a  return  of,
maybe, R50 to that subsistence fisher.

I think having  access  to  the  markets  would  encourage  the  subsistence
fishermen to take ownership of the resource, and  would  then  generate  the
situation where they would protect the resource with their own future.

I would also like to suggest that there needs to be intervention as  far  as
the tourism industry is concerned as well. There are a  few  huge  stumbling
blocks  that  prevent  new  entrants  from  participating  in  the   tourism
industry.

The  inability  of  many  people  to  access  capital  to  develop  new  and
diversified tourism products is a problem, especially with  the  support  of
those products being questioned by commercial banks, and being  regarded  as
high risk by commercial banks.

We have a situation in which people develop a tourism product, and  may  not
have the capital for the marketing. They would then  have  to  wait  over  a
period of time before support for that product is shown. I've  often  had  a
dream of bringing in a jumbo jet full of tourists, and from the moment  they
land, making them available to the sector that has not participated  in  the
industry in the past, and  having  them  transported  by  these  people  are
transported to new products, products that the  tourists  are  looking  for.
They would be  given  a  10-day  African  experience,  after  which  further
products can be developed, if the assurance can be given that  that  product
is going to be supported on a daily basis by a  sector  of  people  on  that
jumbo jet that's landing in our country, who would be taken  around  by  new
participants. My dream is that, with the assurance of support, products  can
be developed because loans would be attainable.

I think that there is  a  lot  going  for  our  tourism.  We've  shown  huge
strides. The Eastern Cape is proud to say that  we  have  now  launched  our
master plan in tourism. It's something we have worked on for the  last  five
years, and it was launched last week.

There is a very positive tone in  the  Eastern  Cape,  as  far  as  economic
development is concerned, as far as tourism  is  concerned  and  as  far  as
participation in the fishing industry is concerned.

I would just like to end my input by saying that we support the budget,  and
I would like everybody to take note that the sun is shining on  the  Eastern
Cape. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, Minister  Moosa  and  colleagues,  it  is  quite
+appropriate that the Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism's
Budget Vote should be debated during World Environment Week. The  theme  of,
and powerful slogan for these  celebrations,  namely  ``Water:  Two  billion
people are dying for it'', are aptly expressed in the words of the hon  Kofi
Annan when he says that, ``It highlights the centrality of  water  to  human
survival and sustainable development''.

The sustainable provision of clean and fresh water to every human  being  is
only possible if we, who are not the owners, but the custodians,  of  nature
and the environment, realise and execute our duty to clean up  and  maintain
the very environment in which we live, and to start giving a human  face  to
environmental issues. It is, therefore, also appropriate that  we  celebrate
World Environment Week, during which we can pause and reflect on  the  state
of our environment, and on the effects of our environmental behaviour.

Die beskerming en koestering van die omgewing is egter nie 'n saak  wat  net
gedurende Wêreldomgewingsweek hoog op ons agenda moet wees  nie.  Daarom  is
dit goed dat twee van die departement se  belangrike  deurlopende  programme
te make het met, eerstens,  omgewingskwaliteit  en  -beskerming  wat  daarop
gerig is om om te sien na die grondwetlike reg van  elke  Suid-Afrikaner  om
te leef in 'n omgewing wat  nie  skadelik  vir  sy  of  haar  gesondheid  en
lewenskwaliteit is nie, en, tweedens,  omgewingsbeplanning  en  -koördinasie
wat  ontwerp  is  om  ondersteuningsdienste  te  verskaf  vir  doeltreffende
omgewingsbestuur en openbare deelname aan omgewingsaangeleenthede.

Dit is dan ook hierdie programme wat instrumenteel was by  die  promulgering
van regulasies van twee sake wat reeds baie daartoe bygedra het - en ook  in
die toekoms nog hiertoe sal bydra -  tot  'n  omgewing  wat  vir  ons  almal
aangenaam en bevorderlik vir ons gesondheid en  lewensomstandighede  is.  Ek
verwys in die eerste plek na  die  plastieksakregulasies  wat  laat  verlede
jaar afgekondig is, ten spyte van besware  uit  die  bedryf,  en  op  9  Mei
vanjaar  in  werking  getree  het.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[The protection and cherishing of the environment is  not  merely  something
that should only be high  on  the  agenda  during  World  Environment  Week.
Therefore it is a good thing that two of the  department's  most  important,
ongoing programmes deal with, firstly, the quality  and  protection  of  the
environment aimed at protecting the constitutional right of each  and  every
South African citizen to live in an environment that is not  detrimental  to
his or her health or quality of life; and, secondly, environmental  planning
and  co-ordination  designed  to  provide  support  services  for  efficient
environmental management and public participation in environmental affairs.

It  was  this  programme  that  was  instrumental  in  the  promulgation  of
regulations  with  regard  to  two  matters  which  have  already   made   a
contribution - and which will in future make a further contribute  -  to  an
environment that is pleasant and beneficial to our health and conditions  of
living. I refer, firstly, to the regulations on  plastic  bags  issued  last
year - regardless of the complaints from the industry - and which came  into
effect on 9 May this year.]

The serious and dedicated approach of  the  Minister,  and  the  regulations
crafted and implemented to rid us of the plastic bag problem,  have  already
caused innovations to come to the fore. The Institute of  Applied  Materials
in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Pretoria  has
apparently already developed a so-called ``photodegradable'' plastic,  which
degrades within  two  weeks  into  water  and  carbon  dioxide  when  it  is
simultaneously exposed to sunlight and oxygen.  The  future  application  of
this invention in plastic bag technology, and the affect  it  will  have  on
environmental pollution, is obvious.

The second set  of  control  measures  which  have  already  had  beneficial
effects on our coastline are those prohibiting the use  of  4x4s  and  other
private vehicles on beaches. The Minister is to be  commended  on  his  firm
stand as far as this matter is concerned, also in the face  of  the  threats
by members of the public to use their vehicles on  KZN  beaches  during  the
annual sardine run.  These  individuals  clearly  do  not  care  that  their
irresponsible  actions  and  behaviour  cause  significant   harm   to   the
environment, and seriously affect the rights of the ordinary  South  African
to enjoy the beaches.

Last year South Africa hosted the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development
with great success - an  achievement  which  placed  not  just  an  ordinary
feather, but a great big and proud ostrich plume, in the  department's  cap.
I suppose a toast would be in order. [Interjections.]

Although not on such an enormous scale, but also of significant  importance,
is the World Parks Congress, an event convened once every 10  years  by  the
World Conservation Union, which will be hosted by  South  Africa  in  Durban
during September. It will be a first, not only for  South  Africa  but  also
for Africa. DEAT is wished every success in the arrangement of  this  event,
which will act as a stimulus for increased support for the central  role  of
protected areas in the livelihood of the peoples of this continent, and  the
role this can play in the eradication of poverty in Africa.

In closing, I wish to thank the Minister for the  lovely  gift.  I  am  told
that in South African indigenous culture each  design  and  the  colours  of
beadwork have a special significance  and  message.  Not  knowing  what  the
exact message on this glass is, I assume that it could mean something  like:
Drink and enjoy - but do not drink too heavily! [Laughter.]  I  also  assume
that it will not be necessary for  members  to  declare  these  gifts,  even
though they are priceless.

The New NP supports the Budget  Vote  of  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism. [Applause.]

Ms B SCOTT (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, hon members,  in  contradiction  to
the hon Bhengu who is not a member of  the  conservation  and  environmental
portfolio  committee  in  the  province,  that  I  chair,  may  I  begin  by
congratulating the hon Minister on his address and brave stance on 4X4s  and
plastic bags. You do  have  the  full  support  of  KwaZulu-Natal,  and  our
department is working in close co-operation with you.
Our most pressing challenge in the province, right now, is  the  enforcement
of this ban, as has been  alluded  to,  during  the  imminent  sardine  run.
During this period ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Bhengu!

Mr M J BHENGU: Thank you, Chair.  I  couldn't  hear  what  special  delegate
Scott said. Why was she referring to me? She said  something  in  connection
with Bhengu. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  Bhengu,  don't  feel  intimidated.  Hon
member, can you continue with your speech, please?

Ms B SCOTT: During the sardine run it may be useful for some officials  from
the department to help us monitor this potentially explosive situation.

In the hon Minister's address he spoke of the Greater St Lucia Wetland  Park
Authority. This park has been declared a World Heritage Site. This gives  me
the opportunity to speak on one of my biggest bugbears.

The Wetlands Park extends to the Mozambique  border,  and  incorporates  the
Maputoland Coastal Forest Reserve. In this little haven apartheid  is  alive
and well, and it requires  urgent  intervention  from  national  Government.
This was one of the first field trips taken by  the  fledgling  conservation
portfolio committee in early 1996. In the space of two days, members of  the
committee were exposed to the worst form of abuse imaginable. This  pristine
coastal environment is home to no  less  than  four  SAPS,  one  SANDF,  one
health and numerous private  holiday  camps,  including  one  owned  by  the
Chamber of  Mines,  all  of  which  were  built  in  highly  sensitive  dune
environments, in four instances on a  primary  dune.  And  while  marauding,
drunk, white policemen soak it up in one of this province's  most  beautiful
marine environments, little, if anything, has happened to  improve  the  lot
of the rural poor who live within the reserve's boundaries.

I have in my possession the report drafted by  the  portfolio  committee  in
1996. While this report is seven years old,  there  has  been  no  political
will on the part of the IFP, who controlled this Ministry up to  two  months
ago. So, other than a proposal for  some  sort  of  development  at  Mabibi,
absolutely nothing has changed. One can accurately speculate on the  reasons
for this gross political inertia, but this could be a  subject  for  another
debate, perhaps at the TRC.

Seven years ago the committee, headed by  the  ANC,  demanded  an  immediate
moratorium on the occupation of these sensitive beach sites by  white  civil
servants and fat cats in the Chamber of Mines, and the like, who  contribute
a few rands in gate fees  to  run  riot  in  this  reserve  each  year.  Yet
Pretoria police and army bigwigs  continue  to  holiday  at  Kosi  Bay  with
impunity at our expense. No concrete steps have been taken to  remove  these
camps. On the contrary, the situation has deteriorated further with  illegal
developments spreading throughout the reserve.

As the chairperson for conservation  and  environment  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  I
plead on behalf of the committee for the hon  Minister,  together  with  our
hon MEC, Mr Dumisane Makhaya, to take urgent corrective steps in  this,  one
of KwaZulu-Natal's most unique conservation  and  coastal  environments.  Mr
Minister, please may I invite you for an in situ site  visit,  and  help  us
stop this abuse.

One of these campsites used to  be  the  holiday  camp  for  the  well-known
Vlakplaas Unit, namely the Black Rock Campsite, and it is  still  only  used
by the bigwigs  in  Pretoria,  or  white  civil  servants.  There's  even  a
campsite, as I said, belonging to  the  health  unit.  When  we  had  public
hearings, what we were told, as a committee, was that this holiday camp  for
the health unit was for white doctors as  an  incentive  to  work  in  black
rural areas. [Interjections.] I mean it is staggering,  and  this  is  still
happening today.

Mr Minister, we do support your budget, but we really look for your help  in
this instance. [Applause.]
Mr R M NYAKANE: Thank you, Madam Chairperson, members and hon Minister.  Our
MEC apologises  for  not  being  able  to  pitch  for  this  debate  due  to
unforeseen circumstances.

Polokwane was the host of the National Waste Summit two  years  ago,  and  a
key output of that summit - which saw Government, business and NGOs  meeting
and agreeing - was the Polokwane  Declaration.  Some  call  the  declaration
ambitious. Some see the goals as  unattainable.  But,  hon  members,  it  is
imperative that we take control to ensure that we give  effect  to  the  so-
called environmental clause of  our  Constitution,  particularly  to  ensure
that we as Government are able to deliver on the demand that everyone has  a
right to an environment that  is  not  harmful  to  his  or  her  health  or
wellbeing.

Clearly it is an important task, and it is imperative that we as  Government
rise to the challenge, not just because we are required  to  do  so  by  the
Constitution, not even because it is the right and proper thing to  do,  but
also from a simple, economic point of view. It  is  more  cost-effective  in
the long run for the state to ensure that pollution is  minimised  than  for
that same state to have to carry the  health  care  costs  of  a  population
harmed by pollution.

We  have  in  the  National  Environmental  Management  Act  a   fundamental
principle which guides us in dealing with matters of pollution. Put  simply,
it says ``the polluter pays''. For too long  polluters  have  been  able  to
impose their externalities on society and on  the  state.  In  other  words,
fundamental costs of production, namely the environmental and health  costs,
have been borne, not by the producer, but by the environment and by  people,
frequently people who obtain no benefit from that production.

Clearly this is unreasonable and unfair, and it leads,  in  many  cases,  to
what is called environmental racism - the location  of  lower-income  groups
in unhealthy or polluted environments, as a result of  the  property  prices
being lower in those areas. Thus, those who are poorest and most  vulnerable
are made to bear the costs of production of those who are  the  richest  and
most powerful. [Interjections.]

To this end we applaud the initiatives by the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism to address many of the vectors of pollution. The  recent
plastic bag regulations  have  already  had  a  noticeable  effect  in  this
regard, and the environment has benefited. But, of equally  importance,  the
regulations  have  stimulated  creative  thinking  in  many   sectors,   and
alternatives to the polluting plastic bags are beginning to  emerge  on  the
market. We anticipate that this will be a blossoming source  of  income  for
the informal sector.

The next  challenge  to  be  faced  is  the  mountain  of  tyres  which  are
accumulating in our landfills. They are costly to break down,  as  this  has
to happen mechanically. Yet, if not shredded they take up  enormous  amounts
of space in landfills. Worse, they are easy to set alight, and  create  huge
amounts of air pollution when this occurs. Even  in  Polokwane  this  was  a
problem on more than one occasion last year. While  it  is  bad  enough  for
them to catch fire accidentally, even worse is  the  deliberate  burning  of
tyres, often by people attempting to  extract  the  small  amount  of  metal
found within the carcass. We are pleased to  be  working  closely  with  the
national department on an integrated solution to this problem.

Hon members, the House will be well aware that environmental  management  is
a  concurrent  competence  between  national  and  provincial   spheres   of
government, and the implication of this is that  it  is  the  provinces  who
must implement the legislation as it is developed. This arrangement  can  be
complicated enough, and it is made yet more  complex  in  the  case  of  air
pollution, which is listed in Schedule 4, Part B, of  the  Constitution,  as
an exclusive competence of local government. Yet simple logic will  tell  us
that air  pollution  goes  where  the  wind  blows,  and  thus  respects  no
municipal, provincial or national boundary. To  this  extent  we  appreciate
the efforts of the department to produce a legislative  regime,  which  will
enable standards for ambient air to be set at a national level,  and  to  be
monitored at all three spheres of government. In this  regard,  however,  we
feel a clearer role for provinces to take action against pollution needs  to
be provided for in the legislation,  as  there  will  undoubtedly  be  cases
where local government is unable or unwilling to do so.

Hon members, the spirit of Letsema flows through the  environmental  sector.
There are numerous structures and individuals  who  voluntarily  give  their
time and their energy to ensure a healthy environment.  Of  course  we  must
acknowledge the limitations of cleaning campaigns. It is true that they  are
not long-term solutions. They need to be handled sensitively so  as  not  to
distress organised labour in the cleaning  sector.  They  need  to  be  well
planned and managed to avoid exposing vulnerable people, such  as  learners,
to health risks like rats, pollution and medical waste. An  overemphasis  on
cleaning campaigns can undermine the development of a  long-term  integrated
waste management plan for an area.

But if we  are  sensitive  to  the  limitations,  they  remain  a  wonderful
mobilising project. How gratifying it  is  to  see  an  army  of  volunteers
descend on a polluted area  and  return  with  bag  after  bag  of  rubbish,
eventually leaving a clean site. How  positive  for  the  self-esteem  of  a
community, how good for building awareness and even for building companies.

Limpopo is a rural province. As such, the majority of the population  depend
directly on their environment, be it for fuel such as  wood  or  for  water.
With this dependence comes vulnerability. Africa is a water-poor  continent,
and it is incumbent on us to manage our resources - not only rural  Limpopo,
but industrialised Cape Town as well. Yet,  while  Cape  Town  exceeded  its
water resources many years ago, and now colonises  the  resources  of  other
districts, Limpopo remains almost entirely self-sufficient, yet  vulnerable.
It is indeed  ironic  that  only  a  few  years  ago  we  were  calling  for
assistance for flood relief, and now we are in the grip of a drought.

Clearly this highlights the need for greater awareness, on the part  of  all
sectors of our population, regarding the functioning of the  biosphere,  and
of the role of weather and weather cycles in the most  basic  parts  of  our
lives.

Lastly, I have been instructed not to forget to  thank  you,  the  Minister,
and your department for the continued support  and  assistance  received  by
the province. May this gesture be maintained in the spirit of effective  and
efficient delivery. The Limpopo  province  supports  the  implementation  of
this Vote. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Nksz B N DLULANE: Mhlalingaphambili, Mphathiswa nabo bonke abakhoyo  abasuka
kumaphondo,  masiyibulele  into  esoloko  isenzeka  eLimpopo.   Kuyabonakala
okokuba le demokrasi isizela neento ezintle. Rhoqo  sisoloko  sibona  ilungu
elingu'tat'  uNyakane  limela  abaphathiswa   abaye   bangezi   kule   Ndlu.
Bamthembile kambe okokuba angabamela.

Xa ndibuyela kwintetho yanamhlanje, omnye  wemisebenzi  yethu  ebalulekileyo
malungu ePalamente esinikwa wona  kukuba  sihambe  ngokwengxelo  nemisebenzi
esinikwa yona  yingxelo  yomhla  we-8  kaJanuwari  yinkomfa  yesizwe  ye-ANC
yamashumi amahlanu ananye kunye nentetho kaMongameli,  i`state-of-the-nation
address' ePalamente ngokunjalo neLekgotla. Zonke  zimise  umgaqo-nkqubo  we-
ANC wokuseka ubomi obungcono kubantu bonke. Le misebenzi nale  migaqo-nkqubo
ibandakanya  ukuncitshiswa  kwendlala,  ukuvuselela  imveliso,   ukuvuselela
ukholo kuqoqosho nokuphucula iimeko zentlalo yabantu.

Okukhulu nokuphambili bubukho benguqu  kwintlalo  yabantu  eya  kuthi  idale
ubukho  bobomi  babantu  abanemveliso  nengenisa  eseka  ubutyebi  namathuba
kubantu  abahluphekileyo,  ze   ngolo   hlobo   kuvaleke   umsantsa   okhoyo
wokungalingani kwabantu. Ndiqala ngesi  siqalo  nje  kungokuba  mna  ndimele
umbutho wesizwe kule ngxelo. Omnye umntu uya kuxakwa kukukuba yintoni na  le
nto ithethwa leli lungu.

Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo, le veki yiveki eyaziwa  ngelokuba  yiVeki
yeSizwe yoKusingqongileyo (National Environmental Week).  Ekubeni  lo  nyaka
kwihlabathi waziwa njengowamanzi apho iibhiliyoni ezimbini zabantu  kwilizwe
liphela  zifa  ngenxa  yawo.  Ukanti  ekhaya  apha  kuMzantsi  Afrika  sithi
oKusingqongileyo kuBomi Bethu `My environment, my  life'.  Okuyinene  kukuba
ekubeni,  kwihlabathi,  lo   nyaka   unikezelwe   ekubeni   ngowamanzi   oko
kukukhuthaza   oorhulumente   okokuba   baseke    oluthe    vetshe    ulwazi
ngokusetyenziswa nononophelo lwamanzi, ulawulo  nokhuseleko  lwawo.  Kwakho,
kuvulwa  nenkongolo  yokuba  kukhawuleziswe  ubonelelo  lwamanzi   kwiindawo
ekwavunyelwana   ngazo   kwihlabathi,    kuMzantsi    Afrika    nakumaphondo
ngamaphondo.

Okona kulizinyo eliqaqambayo  kukuba  abantu  bethu  bayiqonde  into  yokuba
ngeli  thuba   laba   rhulumente   bethu   kumaphondo   ngamaphondo   sifuna
ukuqinisekisa  okokuba  ikho  inguqu   kwimiba   yokusingqongileyo,   nokuba
ngabantu  bona  gaqa  ekufuneka  bedlale  indima  enkulu  ekuguquleni  ubomi
bokusingqongileyo, basebenzele ukuseka ulwahlulelwano  (partnerships)  oluya
kuqinisekisa okokuba ixesha  elizayo  likhuselekile,  likwanayo  nempumelelo
kunye nenzuzo.

Mininzi ke, Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo, imisitho ebanjwayo,  sithetha
nje,   kumaphondo   ngamaphondo   eli   lethu   ngokuphathalele   kulo   mba
wokusetyenziselwa, ukwamkela nokwazi  ngoko  ekuthethwa  ngako,  amanzi  ke,
ngokunxulumene  nokuphucula  nokuza  nembono  entsha   ngolawulo   olungcono
lwamajelo amanzi. Ikhwelo  lityala  ke  mawethu,  kuba  umngeni  esiwenzayo,
Sihlalo, ngowokuba  uluntu  luphela  lume  bume  ukusasaza  igospile  yokuba
amanzi ethu  alawulwe  ngcono,  ukwenzela  ukuba  iinjongo  zophuhliso  zale
nkulungwane sifikelele kuzo, ukuze isiqingatha soluntu  esingafumani  amanzi
ngoku sifumane ngokupheleleyo amanzi  ngonyaka  ka-2015.  Ndithetha  kangaka
nje ngamanzi ayinxalenye yokuba ezi fishi,  uthetha  ngazo  mam'  uVersveld,
ukuba angaphela anqongophale amanzi ngekhe uphinde  uze  apha  endlwini  uze
kuthetha ngazo.

Siyathemba ke, Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo  okokuba  ootitshala  bethu
bohlangabezana  nathi  nale  migaqo-nkqubo,  bayidibanise  kunye  namabakala
ngamabakala omsebenzi wabo, ze kwakhona bawafumane elulutho  kubo  amaphepha
nemipapasho esasazwa ngamasebe ngamasebe kaRhulumente ngale miba.

Mandithethe  ngokhenketho.  Umngeni  omkhulu  woshishino  lokhenketho  kweli
lizwe lethu  ngowokuba  sigxininise  ukuyiqonda  nokuyiqaphela  into  yokuba
ukhenketho luza nemisebenzi, kwaye imisebenzi  sisitshixo  sozinzo  lwesizwe
kupolitiko,  intlalo  noqoqosho.  Sihlalo,  yinkolelo   yethu   ukuba   apha
kuMzantsi  Afrika  kubatyeleli  abasibhozo  kwilizwe  eli,  bephuma  kumazwe
angaphaya  kwimida,  kukho   isithuba   somsebenzi   esinye   esifumanekayo.
Ukhenketho lubaluleke kakhulu xa uqaphela  into  yokuba  ujika  abakhenkethi
abasibhozo  babe  zizigidi   ezisibhozo.   Uthetha   ngentaphane   yezithuba
zomsebenzi ezivulekayo komnye wemiba yoshishino esebenzisa abantu. Yile  nto
kufuneka  siyijongile  into  yokuba  xa  sibona  aba  bantu,  oosomashishini
nabantu bamanye  amazwe  beze  kwenza  nokuba  yintoni,  sichulumanche  kuba
banezakhono,  kutsho  kufumaneka  imisebenzi.  Masiyeke  ukuba  leqa   sithi
mabahambe baze  kusigqibela  imisebenzi,  sibe  singakwazi  thina  ukuyidala
imisebenzi.

Luchulumancho, ke Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo, ukuqaphela ukuba  kweli
lizwe lethu kukho unxibelelwano kwabezoshishino kunye  nokhenketho  njengoko
iBusines Trust,  umbutho  osekwe  ngoongxowa-nkulu  kwezoshishino  kuMzantsi

[Ms  B  N  DLULANE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  all  the   provincial
delegates,  let  us  commend  what  has  been  happening  in  Limpopo.  This
democracy is bringing us good things.  We  always  see  hon  Member  Nyakane
representing MECs that find themselves unable to come  to  the  House.  That
means they have considerable trust in him.

Coming back to today's debate, one of our  very  important  functions  which
was mandated to us as hon members of Parliament is to do a follow-up on  the
report of 8 January that was submitted at the 51st  National  Conference  of
the ANC and the President's state of the nation  address  in  Parliament  as
well as at the Lekgotla. All these re-asserted the ANC's policy of  creating
a better  life  for  all.  These  functions  and  policies  include  poverty
reduction, renewal of production, economic regeneration  and  improving  the
quality of life of the people.

The main issue is change in the living conditions of  people  that  will  be
created through sustained  people-centred  economic  development  that  will
ultimately create opportunities for poor people, so  that  the  gap  between
the haves and the have-nots could be narrowed. I am  talking  on  behalf  of
the national organisation here.

This week is known as National Environmental Week. The irony  is  that  this
year is internationally recognised as the year  of  water  but  two  billion
people in the world die because of circumstances related  to  it.  In  South
Africa  we  say,  "My  environment  is  my  life".  As  this  year  is   the
International  Year  of  Water,  governments  are  encouraged  to  establish
educational  programmes   about   water   conservation   and   preservation,
management and protection thereof. Furthermore, there is a conference  aimed
at accelerating access to water in agreed-upon areas in all the provinces.

What is of paramount importance is that our people  should  understand  that
in our provincial governments we  are  seeking  to  ensure  that  there  are
changes in matters relating to the environment and  that  people  themselves
should form partnerships that would ensure that in future they  are  secured
and successful and generate a profit.

There are many celebrations  taking  place  in  different  provinces  as  we
speak. They are about the use of water, education and improving as  well  as
proposing new  ideas  about  water  management.  This  is  a  wake-up  call,
compatriots, that people in  communities  should  wake  up  and  spread  the
gospel about water management so that we can be able to  successful  in  our
development initiatives, and so that half the  number  of  people  for  whom
water is still inaccessible, can have it accessible to  them  by  2015.  The
reason I am talking so passionately about the subject is because these  fish
you are talking about, Mrs Versveld, will die and become  extinct  if  there
is no water.

We hope that our teachers will assist us in regard to these policies by  way
of integrating them in their syllabi,  and  that  they  will  find  Gazettes
useful.
I shall now talk about tourism. The big challenge in tourism in our  country
is for us to emphasise our understanding of the fact that tourism opens  job
opportunities  and  that  jobs  are  the  key  to  a  sustainable  politico-
socioeconomic status in the country. Chairperson, it is our belief  that  in
South Africa, for every eight tourists from different parts  of  the  world,
one job is created. Tourism is very important and if you look you will  find
that, converted, those tourists are equal to eight million rands.  You  will
be talking about a number of jobs opening up  in  one  aspect  of  business.
That is why we have to note what these  people,  businesspeople  and  people
from different countries are coming to do  here  and,  therefore,  be  happy
about it because there will be jobs available.

It is important,  therefore,  to  make  sure  that  there  is  communication
between business and the tourism sector just as the Business Trust is  doing
by putting tourism in a very high position. It is important to note as  well
that, together with the  Department  of  Education,  they  support  training
programmes and the process of accreditation by ensuring  the  upliftment  of
the standard of expertise and provide a good  service  for  businesses  that
have to bring  about  an  experience  of  high  quality  for  tourists  from
different nations who bring in revenue to South Africa.

It is through tourism that the number of unemployed people in our  provinces
will be reduced and we can see an increase in investment opportunities  that
would lead to economic development. I  note  with  joy  that  there  already
exists co-operation between provincial governments and  municipalities,  and
that Agenda 21 is already producing results with regard to the  matter  that
there should be ...]

... the incorporation of tourism and economic planning into  municipalities'
planning and implementation processes.

Ngolo hlobo, ukhenketho luza  kukhuthaza  uluntu  lwamaphandle  ukuze  bona,
kanye, bathabathe inxaxheba. Oomasipala  baza  kuba  nenxaxheba  yokufundisa
nokusasaza  ulwazi  neengcaciso  ngokusingqongileyo  nangemveli   (heritage)
yethu. Ukanti okona kubalulekileyo kukuba kuza kubakho ukwanda  okulinganayo
jikelele kwimiba yokhenketho kuwo olithoba amaphondo.

Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo, xa kuhanjwa  ngezi  zikhokelo  zingentla,
ukhenketho lunganenxaxheba enkulu yokuba ngonyaka ka-2014  sibe  isiqingatha
sabantu  abangaphangeliyo  ngoku  sisemisebenzini,  ngakumbi,  xa  kumiselwa
iinkqubo ezitshitshisa  indlala  zijongane  ngqo  nokususwa  kwezinto  eziza
kukhomba emva kwinkqubo kandalashe  we-apartheid,  kuqinisekisa  ukuthabatha
inkxaxheba kwabamnyama kuqoqosho, abakhubazekileyo,  amakhosikazi  nolutsha.
Ngolo hlobo singakwazi ukufikelela kuko  xa  siseka  amashishini  amancinane
siwamisela ukuba abe nenkxaso enkulu kuqoqosho lwethu.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi, ndithetha ngoshishino lweentlanzi.  Noxa  kwezinye
iindawo   kusekhona   ukungeneliseki,   kodwa   manditsho   ukuthi   sihlalo
nalamalungu ale Ndlu kuluvuyo nemiyeyeye kwakho  ukuba  singqine  ngaphandle
kwamathandabuzo  ukuba  iimbono  nemimmiselo  ka1955   yoMqulu   weNkululeko
(Freedom  Charter)  ibonakala  iyinyaniso  nanamhlanje  njengoko  kwamiselwa
ngoko, kulungiselelwa eli xesha siphila  kulo,  ukuba  ubutyebi  beli  lizwe
lethu buya kubuyiselwa ebantwini balo.

Siyabona, kananjalo, kwicandelo leentlanzi kweli  lizwe,  njengoko  sithetha
nje  kushishino  leentlanzi  inguqu   yokubonakala   kwamalungelo   amathuba
alinganayo  ihamba  kakuhle  kuba  yinkungu  nelanga  yeenkampani   zabantu,
abebebandezelekile kumaxa angaphambili. Ngoku baba  vulelwe  amathuba  ngoku
okuba nabo bathabathe inxaxheba ekuxhamleni kolu  shishino,  nto  entsha  ke
leyo. Huntshu! Mphathiswa.

Kananjalo, siyazi okokuba kukhona aba  bantu  abazenza  aba  bantu  ekuthiwa
zii`front'  siqinisekile  uza  kubabamba   ubaphose   eziseleni   ezimnyama.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[In that way, tourism will certainly encourage rural people  to  participate
fully and wholeheartedly. Municipalities will  have  the  responsibility  of
disseminating information about the environment and our  heritage.  What  is
important about this is that there will be equal increase  and  interest  in
matters of tourism in all nine provinces.

If things are done according to the guidelines that I have mentioned  above,
tourism would ensure that by 2014 half the number  of  that  are  unemployed
now are in employment, especially if the programmes and processes  that  are
introduced would be directly aimed  at  reducing  poverty  and  hunger,  and
completely remove everything that carries the  legacy  of  apartheid.  Black
people's participation in developing the economy is  important,  and  so  is
that of disabled persons, women and  the  youth,  and  that  we  could  only
achieve by establishing entrepreneurships  and  starting  small  businesses.
That would certainly make an impact in the economy of this country.

In conclusion, I would like to say something  about  the  fishing  industry.
Although there is still dissatisfaction in certain areas, I  would  like  to
say that it is with pleasure that we are witnessing all that was adopted  in
the Freedom Charter in 1955 that states that the  national  wealth  of  this
country, the heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the people.

We can see in the fishing industry  that  there  are  changes  in  that  the
historically disadvantaged people are getting  equal  opportunities  in  the
fishing business. Opportunities have now been opened for them to  take  part
in the business and enjoy the benefits; something that is  new.  We  applaud
you, hon Minister! In the same breath, I would like  to  say  that  we  know
that there are people who are fronting and  we  are  certain  that  you  are
going to arrest them. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson. May I at the outset express gratitude to the members for  their
extremely useful comments, as well as interventions that have been  made.  I
would like  to  express  gratitude  to  Rev  Moatshe  for  his  kind  words,
especially towards the officials and members of the department.

The hon Sulliman spoke about the  decline  in  the  fishery  sector  in  the
Northern Cape. There are a few things that need to  be  said.  Firstly,  the
department is working very closely  with  the  provincial  government  on  a
number of interventions in that area in order to change the  situation.  But
you will bear in mind that part of the difficulty has been that some of  the
bigger companies tend to move their processing facilities around.  And  when
they move a processing facility out of a particular area, especially  if  it
is a coastal fishing town or village, it does have a major impact as far  as
unemployment is concerned.

The other peculiar situation with the Northern Cape is  that  about  80%  of
the coastline is a diamond concession area held by  De  Beers  and  Alexkor.
The eventual change in the  status  of  the  diamond  concession  area  will
create many opportunities for local people in terms of  harvesting  some  of
the coastal marine resources that exist there, and that is the matter  which
the department is working on, and giving consideration to,  because  if  you
take an area like Hondeklip Bay, which is one  of  the  biggest  settlements
along that coastline, there is access to only 10km of the coastline for  the
people living under Hondeklip Bay. That is  the  situation,  which,  in  the
long term, is not sustainable.

For the Northern Cape particular attention is being  given  to  mariculture,
and the department is also of the view  that  there  are  lots  of  possible
opportunities there. I am also pleased that you mentioned the issue  of  the
transfrontier parks, and the impact that they have  on  the  Northern  Cape.
Unfortunately I do not have the numbers available with regard to the  impact
as far as job creation is concerned. What would be available,  though,  from
the Department is the poverty relief projects in  and  around  transfrontier
parks, and probably in  the  Northern  Cape  as  a  whole,  that  have  been
implemented in that province, and the jobs  created.  Those  jobs  we  track
very, very closely, so you will able to get all the numbers for those  jobs.
I think the department will have those available.
The Northern Cape is one  province  which  has  worked  very  well  with  SA
National Parks in  order  to  maximise  both  the  conservation  value  that
national parks can bring, and also the tourism value  that  they  can  bring
because of the brand national parks. There are a number  of  very  important
national parks in the Northern Cape: the Kgalagadi Transfrontier  Park,  and
the Richtersveld Park which is a very unique mountain desert - it is  unique
in the world. Then, of course, the growing Namaqualand National Park. I  say
it is growing, because it is very much in its  initial  stages.  That  is  a
very important park, from a global point of view, because of the  succulents
in the Karoo, and the very rare plants that exist in that  particular  area.
It has a very high level of endemism, and  for  a  very  long  time  it  was
thought that the fynbos kingdom, from a biodiversity point of view, is in  a
class of its own.  That  biodiversity  in  Namaqualand  very  often  is  now
visited by some of the most prominent botanists from around the  world,  and
it is now regarded as a biodiversity hot spot.

I am mentioning all of this, possibly to link up with  the  point  that  the
hon De Wet made in response  to  many  comments  about  national  parks  and
provincial parks, namely that you will find that the Eastern  Cape  probably
subsidises the parks in the province to the  tune  of  R35  million,  if  my
memory serves me right. KwaZulu-Natal, on the other  hand,  subsidise  their
parks to the extent of R200 million.  Now  if  you  take  into  account  the
correct point which you made, it is really the  revenue-generating  capacity
of the provincial parks that would impact on  the  subsidy.  Some  of  those
principal parks in KwaZulu-Natal are absolutely  jammed.  One  would  wonder
why it is that the revenue regeneration over the years has not  in  any  way
been comparable to what has been possible, for example, with  parks  in  the
Northern Cape. If you take the Kgalagadi National Park - which is very  far,
very distant - or the Augrabies Falls National Park, for both  of  those,  I
can assure you, if you make a call today, trying to  get  bookings  for  the
next few months, you would not be able to.  They  have  occupancies  in  the
range of 90%. They are not a drain on taxpayers' money. It is the manner  in
which you organise your park system, and how you link it to ecotourism  that
counts.

I believe that the Eastern Cape needs a major  national  park.  It  needs  a
major national park to  bring  in  the  critical  mass.  It  is  of  a  high
biodiversity value. It is the most diverse  province,  from  a  biodiversity
point of view, in the country. You have the Karoo and you have  the  coastal
forests. You have the kind of  national  resources  which  should  make  the
Eastern Cape an ecotourism  mecca.  But  that  is  not  the  case.  We  have
proposed the establishment  of  a  Pondoland  national  park,  for  example,
because of the importance of the Pondoland coast from a  biodiveristy  point
of view and also because the  coastal  belt  is  not  very  useful  from  an
agricultural point of view. Because of the unique natural  features  in  the
area and also because I believe that a Pondoland  national  park  would  put
the parks system, conservation and biodiversity in the Eastern Cape  on  the
international map, it has been proposed. This no  provincial  park  will  be
able to do.

The province is opposed to the idea, which I cannot understand.  It  baffles
my mind. We have been discussing this matter for  years.  If  the  province,
for example, had to run that Augrabies Falls National Park it  would  simply
be a drain on the provincial government's resources. SA National Parks  runs
it, it takes all the risk, and unlike what anybody may think,  this  is  not
money-making. It is simply how you reduce the impact  on  the  taxpayer,  by
reducing the subsidy. You do not get rich out of this  thing,  but  how  you
make money out of  it  is  by  creating  an  economy  around  the  park,  by
attracting tourists to come there.  That  is  what  is  the  most  important
thing. Up to now the national parks model has proven to be most  successful,
not just here, but around the world. You can think of national parks in  the
United States, where the concept really started, or wherever else. So,  this
is the matter that I think we would need to look at much  more  closely  and
in a manner that  is  in  the  best  interests,  both  of  conservation  and
economic growth.

I find it quite interesting, remembering  previous  interventions  that  the
hon Versfeld had made, that she only spoke about  the  question  of  sharks,
which is a rather marginal activity  as  far  as  fisheries  are  concerned.
Frankly, a marginal activity does not really make a massive contribution  to
a GDP or anything of that sort. On the basis of her comments  about  sharks,
she has made rather unfortunate statements  about  the  marine  and  coastal
management branch of the department. She is wrong in almost everything  that
she has said. Unfortunately there  is  no  requirement  in  this  House  for
people's input to be logically consistent, or sensible for that  matter.  So
I suppose she is not, technically speaking, out of order, but it  is  really
not a matter on which I intend to engage with her, except to respond to  her
comment that she has been given the ``runaround'' by the department.

Perhaps I should inform her that the department has  the  responsibility  to
engage with members of Parliament, to give information, not only to  members
of Parliament, but to the general public, and, in the spirit of Batho  Pele,
to serve everybody. But when a person becomes an absolute  nuisance  to  the
department to the extent that they prevent the  department  from  doing  its
core work, which is poverty alleviation and growing the  economy,  there  is
no responsibility, on the part of the department, to  entertain  politically
motivated people who have nothing more than nonsense value.

In  fact,  I  have  instructed  the  department   simply   to   ignore   all
correspondence from the  hon  member.  I  hope  they  have  carried  out  my
instructions, and have not bothered themselves with it at all.  If  she  has
anything to say, she can always write to me. If it  is  the  usual  nonsense
that she writes about, then I will ignore it too.  [Laughter.]  I  am  happy
that she is being given the  runaround  and  that  is  what  should  happen.
Perhaps the members of  the  public  should  also  know  that,  because  she
creates the wrong impression, namely that  she  has  some  sort  of  special
status.  She  has  no  status.  She  has  absolutely  no  influence  in  the
department or in Government, or in any kind of policy. I intend  keeping  it
that way.

I do not think that her party, the DA, is aware of some  of  the  statements
that she makes here, for example, on the banning of  beach-driving.  In  the
National Assembly, the DA supported the ban  on  beach  driving  very,  very
strongly. She is obviously out of sync with what her own  party  is  saying,
and she was speaking on behalf of her party here.

Let me say to the hon Bhengu that there is not a blanket ban on  driving  on
the beach. The ban is on unregulated driving on the beach. So, for  example,
for any kind of bona fide work on the part of various  kinds  of  inspectors
and research workers and such things, permission has been granted.  Where  a
province would approach me about a fishing  competition,  run  by  reputable
people that we can control in a proper manner, we  have  usually  taken  the
advice from the province as such. But you cannot  have  a  situation  where,
because there is a  sardine  run,  people  do  not  go  through  the  proper
process. You have to  apply.  The  regulations  require  you  to  apply  for
permission to drive a vehicle. In your application you have to  say  exactly
what you intend doing. You cannot  just  write  a  friendly  letter  to  the
Minister and say:`` Please let me drive on the beach''.  That  is  not  what
the regulations require, because that  is  not  one  of  the  criteria.  The
regulations also require that you should advertise your intention,  so  that
other users of the beach would be able to give some feedback and respond  to
that, because other people might not  like  it.  So,  where  people  do  not
follow the procedure, they will obviously  not  get  permission,  and  where
they do follow the procedure, but it  is  not  within  the  objects  of  the
regulations, they would not be commissioned either.

The hon Mokitlane from the Free State may  want  to  be  informed  that  the
Vredefort Dome is in fact very special. It is one of the  largest  and  most
ancient meteorite impact sites in the world. The only one larger  than  that
is the one in the Gulf of Mexico which is under water. This is  the  biggest
observable  impact  creator  in  the  world.  So,  it  is  of   very   great
significance. Like the many wonders of our country, many  of  us,  and  many
ordinary people do not know about it, and have not been exposed to it.  That
is partly because of the years and years of apartheid propaganda.  Apartheid
and colonial propaganda was that anything  good,  great  and  important  was
somewhere in Europe, and it could not possibly be  here.  That  was  a  long
legacy, a great deficit that we have  to  overcome  now.  That  is  why  the
declaration of the Vredefort Dome  as  a  World  Heritage  Site  will  bring
international attention,  but  importantly,  more  awareness  to  the  South
African population about this matter. It reminds me about  the  other  point
that you made, namely that you did not know about  Golden  Gate,  while  you
did not live far away from it. It is the same thing all  over  the  country.
You will find that the local people do not know about the great  wonders  on
their own doorsteps.

September, which is tourism month - 27 September is world tourism day  which
we extend for the whole month - is used  as  a  way  of  creating  awareness
about tourism among South Africans. It is really a  domestic  campaign  that
we run for a whole month, together with the provinces. I think that  it  has
made some impact in  the  past.  We  usually  have  quite  a  lot  of  media
coverage, and you will find every morning there will be  a  different  place
that is covered on morning TV. So, that is partly what we are trying to  do.
But, I think that there is a great deal more that needs to be done.

Regarding the point that the hon De Wet has made about SMMEs in the  Eastern
Cape, and the blockages there being the lack of  access  to  funding,  there
are various incentive schemes available for tourism  enterprises.  In  fact,
the department last year, at an occasion in Durban, released  a  publication
on all of the different incentive schemes and support schemes and  financial
schemes that are available for SMMEs in the tourism field. It has  all  been
compiled into one document, because many people do not know about them.

If an SMME comes to you and says, ``I am now trying to set  up  a  business.
Where do you think I could access capital from?'' people do  not  know  what
to say. So we have brought all  that  information  together  from  different
government departments and from all the parastatal  financial  institutions.
It is available on the department's website. I do not know if  we  have  run
out hard copies. It deals with what the DTI does and what Khula does, etc.

I should also mention to you that the tourism enterprise programme which  is
funded and run by the Business Trust is one whose core business is to  bring
businesses to small enterprises. So, if there is  a  small  enterprise,  for
example, somebody has set up  a  bed  and  breakfast,  but  is  not  getting
customers, they would create those link-ups. That is all that they do.  They
do not fund anybody, but they create the linkages for people, and put  small
enterprises into networks. They have done extremely well. They  have  helped
about 646 more enterprises over the past few years worth  tens  of  millions
of rands - in fact hundreds of millions of rands,  worth  of  business.  And
then of course there is the Tourism Indaba where we  subsidise  small  SMMEs
to showcase themselves to an international audience. We have  increased  the
number of the SMMEs every year. Just a few years ago there were  just  about
30 or so SMMEs in the year 2000. This year, at the  Durban  Indaba,  we  had
about 250 or so SMMEs.  So,  that  is  another  opportunity  that  has  been
created.
The hon Scott raised the question about the misuse of the Greater  St  Lucia
Wetland Park, and unregulated use of holiday cottages by  various  sorts  of
people, including government departments. I was  very  interested  in  those
comments, but not because it is news to me. I have heard about  this  matter
previously, but it is a matter on which I thought we  have  made  much  more
progress than you say we have. Obviously we have not made much  progress  if
you say that. You are from the province, and you are the chairperson of  the
committee. We will act on this matter immediately.

I will give an instruction to the deputy  director-general  responsible,  Ms
Pam  Yako  who,  I  take  it,  has  heard  your  comments,  not  to  do   an
investigation, a study or anything of that  sort,  but  simply  to  instruct
that those facilities be closed  down.  We  will  do  that  and  act  on  it
immediately, because I don't think that we would be able to  justify  it  in
any way. In any case, we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in  as  far
as investments are concerned in the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park, and  such
activities would not be consistent with what we are trying to do.

In  the  Greater  St  Lucia  Wetland  Park  area,  because  of  the  spatial
development initiative over the past few years,  very  substantial  sums  of
Government money, from different  Government  departments,  have  gone  into
that area - whether it was the Department of Transport spending on the  road
network, or the Department of Health on the malaria  eradication  programme,
which is one which the World Health Organisation  has  been  very  impressed
with and is recommending be used elsewhere, or in relation to various  other
sorts of work. We are committed, because that is one of  the  poorest  parts
of the country, to ensure that improvements  are  made.  I'm  quite  certain
that, together with MEC Mabuyakhulu, we would be able to proceed at  a  much
faster pace than we have been able to up to now.

I'm happy that you raised the question of tyres  because  it's  a  very  big
problem. We can't use the same tactics as with plastic bags.  We  can't  ban
the use of tyres, because what will motorcars drive  on?  We  can't  have  a
minimum thickness and such things. So, what we are thinking of doing  -  and
we want to do it this year - is finding a way of adding value  to  the  used
tyres that can no longer be used. There is technology for the  recycling  of
tyres. There is massive, and very high-quality technology, and I  know  that
attempts are being made now to import technology from Germany to a plant  in
Gauteng in order to recycle tyres. The recycled tyre products  can  then  be
turned into all sorts of things.

So, what we are thinking of doing is to use a  kind  of  deposit  system  so
that when you buy a tyre, you would at the same time pay  a  deposit,  which
you would get back when you return the used tyre. In  simple  words,  that's
the model of the whole thing. So, if a youngster or an unemployed person  or
anybody sees a tyre lying around, they would be  able  to  take  it  in  and
collect a deposit. That's the best way to get it  out  of  the  environment,
and out of landfill sites. They shouldn't be in landfill sites because  this
is a valuable product that we  are  throwing  away.  It's  a  very  valuable
product. It can be recycled.
We recycle, in this country, 90% of paper and  paper  products  like  board.
There was a time when people used to throw paper and  board  away.  Now  you
find that there are people who go around literally looking for  this  stuff,
because there is value to it. The  recycling  industry  cannot  get  enough.
They are buying it.

We only recycle about 20% of plastics, but that's  something  we  hope  will
increase. But plastic products, once they get recycled,  are  used  to  make
other plastic products. For example, the municipality of the  Tshwane  Metro
has now decided that all of their refuse bags will be made out  of  recycled
plastic. This creates a demand for recycled material, but it also saves  the
metro money, because recycled plastic is cheaper than virgin  plastic.  It's
not more expensive. So once we begin to look at the economics  of  this,  it
begins to make economic sense to do recycling. We will  continue  to  put  a
great deal of emphasis on that.

The hon Dlulane spoke about the importance of the issue of water  and  water
access. She'll be pleased to know that, at the United Nations Commission  on
Sustainable Development, held about a month ago, and which  was  chaired  by
myself,  which  had  to  develop  a  work  programme  for  implementing  the
decisions of the Johannesburg World Summit, a work programme was  developed,
spanning more than a decade, which allocates tasks and  responsibilities  to
different international agencies and UN agencies. It also  decides  on  what
the issues are that we should tackle first because we  took  many  decisions
in Johannesburg, but what do we give priority to? For the  next  two  years,
priority will be given to the issue of water,  on  an  international  level,
for the reasons for which you have said that water is important.

Thank you very much, I have enjoyed the debate. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, thank you very much. On  behalf
of this House I say that all of us have enjoyed this debate. Some  two  days
ago I was talking to the chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee  in  the
National Assembly. She told me, ``You know, chair of the caucus,  one  thing
that I must tell you is that the members of your  own  caucus  do  not  know
this country.'' We are not really touring the country. We do  not  know  the
country, and from this debate today I have learnt for the  first  time  from
Mr Mokitlane that there are these things  that  are  valuable  in  the  Free
State. But I also told him that even those members  that  are  from  Gauteng
don't even know that in Gauteng we have one area which is a  World  Heritage
Site, Sterkfontein Caves. Some of the people don't know where it is. So,  it
is a challenge to us. Thank you very much once more, hon Minister.  We  have
enjoyed the debate.

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 12:24
