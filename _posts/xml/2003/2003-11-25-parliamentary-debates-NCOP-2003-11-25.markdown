QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - see that book.

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Hon  members,
according to the Order Paper we will  be  starting  with  questions  to  the
Ministers today. I have two  requests  here  from  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance. He is requesting that we take his questions a little  bit  earlier,
because they will be debating the Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement  in
the National Assembly. I also have a request from the  Minister  of  Health.
She has an earlier commitment in Pretoria.

I have decided that I will accede to their requests. I hope the  members  do
not have a problem with that. Hopefully other Ministers will agree  that  we
proceed that way. I don't think you will have any problem. Hon  Minister  of
Sport and Recreation,  hon  Balfour?  You've  got  to  go  to  the  National
Assembly to answer a question? I didn't get your request, Minister,  but  it
is fine. Hon Balfour will be first.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek sal by  die  volgende  sitting  van  die
Raad voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) die opening van die Poskantoor se fasiliteit in die Parlement  vandag
       met dank aanvaar;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  die gebeurtenis versuur  is  deur  die  taalarrogansie  van  die
           Poskantoor en sekere amptenare wat nie uit die kultuur  van  die
           Royal Mail uit die Britse tydperk ontsnap nie;


       (b)    die   eentalige   diens   en   kennisgewingborde    nie    die
           veeltaligheidswerklikheid van Suid-Afrika en  hierdie  Parlement
           verteenwoordig nie en dus ook nie in ooreenstemming met die Suid-
           Afrikaanse Grondwet is nie;


       (c)  selfs die seëls wat beskikbaar is nie in een van die 10 inheemse
           tale van Suid-Afrika nie, maar slegs in Engels beskikbaar is; en


       (d)   al  die  goeie  werk  van  Minister  Ivy  Casaburri,  met   die
           bekendstelling van haar taalportaal, tot niet is; en


  (3) 'n beroep op alle tersaaklike parlementêre komitees doen om druk  toe
       te pas op die Poskantoor om sy taalbeleid nou reg te stel  sodat  die
       Poskantoor sy slagspreuke kan uitleef van -


         "Passionate about customer excellence"
         "Embracing diversity in the way we do business"
         "We will deliver whatever it takes"
(Translation of Afrikaans notices motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I shall move at the next  sitting  of  the
Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) gratefully accepts the opening  of  the  Post  Office's  facility  in
       Parliament today;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  this event has been spoilt by the continuing language  arrogance
           of the Post Office and certain officials as  they  cannot  break
           away from the culture of the Royal Mail from the British era;


       (b)  the service and notice  boards  in  only  one  language  do  not
           represent the  multilingual  reality  of  South  Africa  and  of
           Parliament,  and  are  therefore  not  in  accordance  with  the
           Constitution;


       (c)  even the stamps are not available in one of  the  10  indigenous
           languages of South Africa, but only in English; and


       (d)  all Minister  Ivy  Casaburri's  good  work  in  introducing  her
           language portal is gone;


  (3) calls on all relevant parliamentary committees to put pressure on the
       Post Office to correct its language policy in order  to  be  able  to
       realise its slogans of -


         ``Passionate about customer excellence"
         ``Embracing diversity in the way we do business"
         ``We will deliver whatever it takes''.]

This can only be done by recognising  Afrikaans  and  the  other  indigenous
languages.

              BIZARRE TRAINING METHODS USED AT KAMP STAALDRAAD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the bizarre training methods  imposed  upon  our  rugby
       Springboks in the training run-up to the  Rugby  World  Cup  held  in
       Australia;


  (2) considers this kind of  militaristic  psychological  warfare  imposed
       upon our sportsmen by our rugby coaches, as has allegedly occurred at
       Kamp Staaldraad, as an invasion of the privacy  and  dignity  of  the
       sportsmen concerned;


  (3) is of the view that the episode has brought  ridicule  and  dishonour
       upon one of South Africa's national sports, as well as on the players
       concerned;


  (4) further believes that the behaviour of our rugby hierarchy stands  in
       stark contrast to the great sportsmanship displayed  by  our  golfing
       fraternity at the President's Cup in George over the  weekend,  where
       great sportsmanship and wise leadership were the order  of  the  day;
       and


  (5) welcomes the intervention of our Minister of Sport and Recreation  in
       this rugby affair in order to clean  up  the  current  unsatisfactory
       circumstances in our rugby.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       DONATIONS TO ERADICATE POVERTY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges the fact that the eradication  of  poverty  remains  the
       overriding priority of the ANC-led government;


  (2) notes that the Government has donated over three tons of  confiscated
       hake to poor communities in the Western Cape as  part  of  its  fight
       against poverty;


  (3) further notes that this follows a similar process last year when more
       than four tons of confiscated  toothfish  were  distributed  to  poor
       communities in the Eastern Cape; and


  (4) welcomes these donations as further proof of Government's  commitment
       to create a more equal, humane and caring society.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              ROLE OF EDUCATION IN DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the ANC has time and again reaffirmed the  important  role
       education plays in the political, social and economic development  of
       our country;


  (2) further notes that it is the ANC's belief that the poor  should  have
       access to quality education  and  that  schools  servicing  the  poor
       should be adequately provided for  in  terms  of  infrastructure  and
       education resources to break the shackles of poverty;


  (3) acknowledges the fact that under the ANC  government  expenditure  on
       education has grown to become the largest budgetary item at almost 6%
       of gross domestic product, making us one of the  countries  with  the
       highest government investment in education; and


  (4) commends the  Government  and  the  Minister  of  Education  for  the
       commitment  and  dedication  they  have  shown  in  ensuring  quality
       education for all South Africans.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK moved as an amendment: That, in paragraphs (1)  and  (2),
``ANC'' be followed by ``and other participatory parties''.

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:
  (1) notes that the ANC and other  participatory  parties  have  time  and
       again reaffirmed the important role education plays in the political,
       social and economic development of our country;


  (2)  further  notes  that  it  is  the  belief  of  the  ANC  and   other
       participatory parties that the poor should  have  access  to  quality
       education and that schools servicing the poor  should  be  adequately
       provided for in terms of infrastructure and  education  resources  to
       break the shackles of poverty;


  (3) acknowledges the fact that under the ANC  government  expenditure  on
       education has grown to become the largest budgetary item at almost 6%
       of gross domestic product, making us one of the  countries  with  the
       highest government investment in education; and


  (4) commends the  Government  and  the  Minister  of  Education  for  the
       commitment  and  dedication  they  have  shown  in  ensuring  quality
       education for all South Africans.

       is  temporarily  incapacitated  and  is  currently  recuperating   in
       hospital;

   16 DAYS OF ACTIVISM FOR NO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN CAMPAIGN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that today the Deputy President is launching  the  16  Days  of
       Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children Campaign;


  (2) further notes that the campaign  is  aimed  at  increasing  awareness
       about violence directed at  women  and  children,  how  it  manifests
       itself in  our  society  and  the  negative  impact  it  has  on  the
       development of these vulnerable groups;


  (3) acknowledges that since its inception the  ANC  has  fought  for  the
       equality of all sections of South African society and has striven  to
       broaden the consciousness of  society  about  the  challenges  facing
       women and children in our country;


  (4) further acknowledges the specific policies and programmes  that  have
       been  developed  and  implemented  since  1994  to  integrate   these
       vulnerable groups into the mainstream of society; and


  (5) calls on all progressive forces in the  country  who  aspire  to  see
       South Africa liberated  from  all  forms  of  oppression,  to  pledge
       themselves to eliminate discrimination against women and  to  support
       this initiative of the Government to prevent and  eliminate  violence
       against women and children.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       SOUTH AFRICAN MODEL APPEARS ON FRONT COVER OF AMERICAN MAGAZINE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride that Roberta Little,  a  South  African  model  from
       Lansdowne in the Cape Peninsula, appears on the front  cover  of  the
       November 2003 issue of the prestigious  American  Magazine  Town  and
       Country;


  (2) also notes that she is only the second woman of colour in  the  world
       to appear on the front cover of this magazine;


  (3) further notes that, notwithstanding the fact that she lost her mother
       and brother at the age of seven and almost lost her father in a  bomb
       blast in his Durban office six months later - he was the first person
       to appear before  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Committee  in  the
       Western Cape and who has subsequently  been  informed  by  the  Human
       Rights Violation Committee that a gross violation of his human rights
       had occurred - she rose above these personal tragedies in  her  life,
       setting a wonderful example to young South  Africans  who  experience
       hardships in their  lives  to  never  give  up,  but  to  believe  in
       themselves and their country.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     DEATH OF 73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ON FARM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the death of a 73-year-old woman on  her  farm  in
       the Lephalele area near Polokwane on Sunday;


  (2) further notes that two men attacked the woman  and  demanded  a  cell
       phone and cash before battering her with a sharp instrument;


  (3) believes that the woman died on the scene and that  her  husband  was
       injured by the intruders;


  (4) expresses its condolences to her family and friends who are  affected
       by her death; and


  (5) calls on the police to  launch  a  thorough  investigation  into  the
       incident.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        END OF THE MONTH OF RAMADAAN

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chairperson. I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the fasting month of Ramadan ended last night;


  (2) wishes our fellow South Africans of the Muslim  communities  a  happy
       Eid Mubarak; and


  (3) hopes their celebrations are  full  of  joy  and  happiness  on  this
       auspicious day of Eid-ul-Fitr.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs B N SONO: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. I move without notice:
  That the Council, flowing from the Minister of Agriculture's reply  to  a
  question by the hon Durr, requests that -


  (1) a conference report on GMOs be made  available  to  this  Council  to
       satisfy our curiosity;

  FAST-TRACKING OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE ELECTORAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, on behalf of the Chief Whip of  the  Council,  I
move the draft resolution printed  in  his  name  on  the  Order  Paper,  as
follows:
  That the Council ratifies the decision  the  Joint  Subcommittee  of  the
  Joint Programme Committee adopted on 20 November 2003 in accordance  with
  Joint Rule 216(2), namely that the  proceedings  on  the  Electoral  Laws
  Second Amendment Bill [B 73 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 75) be fast-
  tracked by, where necessary, shortening any period within which any  step
  in the legislative process relating to the Bill  must  be  completed,  in
  order to make it possible for the Bill to be passed by the adjournment of
  the current parliamentary session (Announcements, Tablings and  Committee
  Reports, 20 November 2003, p 1503).

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! As there is  no
speakers' list, I shall now put the  question.  The  question  is  that  the
motion be agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in terms  of  section  65
of the Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  the  delegation
heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. Are we  all
in? Yes.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. There is none. I  shall
now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do  so  in  alphabetical
order per province. Delegation heads must please  indicate  to  their  Chair
whether they vote in favour of, or against, or abstain. Eastern Cape?

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, it's a  pleasure
to be here in the NCOP, possibly for  the  last  time  in  this  Parliament,
introducing a Bill of this type. I  hope  this  is  not  the  last  time  in
Parliament altogether.

The introduction of this particular piece of  legislation  marks  a  turning
point in our history, because, for the first time, an  education  Bill  does
not introduce any new policy directions. So  we  have  reached  a  stage  at
which education policies and systems are now in place. We have no  need  for
any radical, new departures.

Delivery - for  those  who  know  nothing  about  Government  -  also  means
delivering the right policies, and  we  have  spent  the  past  seven  years
working out and delivering the policies that our country  needed.  Therefore
the major parts of this Bill represent only a fine-tuning of the system -  a
minor amendment to  align  other  bits  of  legislation  and  to  deal  with
emerging problems which have arisen in the implementation of our laws.

In many ways, therefore, this Bill is a symptom of our  political  maturity,
which requires only minor amendments to legislation on an annual basis.  The
Education Laws Amendment Bill,  I  hope,  will  give  rise  to  debate,  not
necessarily  with  the  permission  of  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  and   not
necessarily limited to this Bill, as we always do in this House.  This  Bill
seeks to amend a number of existing laws: the South  African  Qualifications
Authority Act, our first Act after liberation, passed in 1995;  the  Schools
Act of 1996; the Employment of Educators Act of 1998; and  the  General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act of 2001.

Many of the amendments are  not  contentious,  controversial  or  difficult.
They need very little explanation. I'm sure this will  receive  the  support
of everyone. Other clauses seek to improve the  efficiency  of  the  system,
which should also be supported by all parties.

The more technical amendments, which  I  think  warrant  attention,  are  as
follows. Firstly, there is an increase in the number of seats  allocated  to
teacher unions on the SA  Qualifications  Authority  board.  On  that  basis
there are now three national teacher unions and not two. I  hope  this  will
be supported, because the presentation by teachers, which is essential in  a
quality assessment body, must be uniform.

Secondly, we seek to amend the Employment of Educators  Act.  We  do  so  to
correct some of the references to other  clauses,  and  also  to  allow  the
employer to  appeal  a  finding  or  a  sanction  of  a  presiding  officer.
Employees currently have this right to appeal a decision.  However,  because
we appoint an independent presiding officer to look after  our  disciplinary
proceedings, we have had cases in which the sanctions meted out to  teachers
were highly inconsistent and sometimes grossly unfair.  In  some  cases  the
sanctions were simply too  light  in  comparison  with  other  decisions  in
similar cases.

There must, therefore, be  a  sense  of  equity  and  justice  when  serious
disciplinary charges are brought against teachers and the  result  does  not
reflect the importance of the case. This is where  the  head  of  department
must have the right to appeal, so that the matter  may  be  reconsidered  by
the MEC and not by the national  Minister.  This  is  because  teachers  are
employed by the province,  and  the  appeal  should  go  from  the  deciding
officer through the head of department to the MEC.  So,  this  amendment  is
necessary in order to  ensure  consistency,  fairness  and  justice  in  our
disciplinary procedures.  It  is  not  a  matter  of  controversy.  I  think
everybody  agrees  that  we  must  have  a  good  system  of  ensuring   the
maintenance of the highest standards by our teachers.

The next amendment is a big mouthful. I don't know who invented  this  title
for an Act. It's called the  General  and  Further  Education  and  Training
Quality Assurance Act, generally known on the streets  of  South  Africa  as
the ``Genfetqa'' Act. The Act is amended is order to formalise  a  new  name
for this council. They have chosen the name ``Umalusi''  -  the  shepherd  -
signifying their role in protecting and advancing  standards  in  education,
and we seek your approval for this.

Umalusi is an independent body, and I  take  great  exception  to  something
that appeared in one of those rags  in  Johannesburg  which  said  that  the
increase in the passes  in  matric  must  not  reflect  a  deterioration  in
standards. This is an extraordinary jump: First of all, because more  blacks
are studying for their matric, more  blacks  are  passing,  the  implication
being that there is a deterioration and a lowering of  standards.  Secondly,
it is, in fact, a fundamental attack on  an  independent  body  made  up  of
academics, administrators, and people involved in  education.  It  is  their
job to certify, in terms of the  results,  that,  firstly,  procedures  were
followed; and, secondly, that the results represent  the  standard  in  that
particular country. That is why I take great exception to this editorial  in
a Johannesburg newspaper implying that if there are more passes  in  matric,
the standards somehow or the other have  deteriorated.  This  is  a  harking
back to the old South Africa, and the newspaper and the  proprietors  should
be ashamed of the judgment they have made.

They seek to maintain and protect our standards of education, and  therefore
we seek your approval for the Genfetqa board to  be  called  Umalusi  -  the
shepherd. I think everybody will agree,  and  I  hope  it  will  be  a  good
shepherd too. Umalusi sounds better than Genfetqa, we all  agree.  I  regret
that we did not change the short name of the Bill at the same time.

The major substantive amendment proposed by the legislation relates  to  the
so-called  ``top-up''  payments  to  teachers.  This  practice   of   school
governing bodies paying state-employed teachers  an  additional  income  has
increased enormous injustices and  complexities  in  the  system.  One  must
remember that under our law the state  takes  into  account  the  number  of
children and the needs of the school, and the provisions for teachers -  say
35 teachers. These are state employees. One  then  comes  to  the  governing
bodies. You will see that the fees of governing bodies have increased by  up
to 45% for next year, which is  a  matter  of  great  concern,  because  fee
increases of that type are essentially privatising what are  state  schools,
and then they can appoint additional  teachers.  I  know  of  schools  where
there are 25 state-paid and appointed teachers, and 25 additional teachers.

Now, the appeal, therefore, we are  making  on  behalf  of  the  Council  of
Education Ministers is that school governing bodies play a  bigger  part  in
ensuring that the budgets are approved by the parents, and  not  leave  them
to the chairpersons and the principals of schools. This particular  area  is
a mischief  which  we  are  trying  to  cure,  because  there  has  been  no
regulation in this regard.  In  some  cases  the  provincial  department  of
education has been taken to court to try to enforce  the  continued  payment
of a perk after the governing body has decided  not  to  continue  with  it.
This happened in Limpopo where the governing body decided  not  to  continue
the additional payments. The case was brought against the province  -  which
had no hand or foot in the additional payments - and  they  were  trying  to
say that the province must pay.

In that case, if the application had been  upheld,  there  would  have  been
enormous chaos, because provinces would have had to pay  millions  of  rands
to teachers, when the decision about additional payments  was  not  made  by
them.

It also  has  the  effect  of  criminalising  teachers  because,  under  the
Employment of Educators Act, teachers must seek permission to receive  extra
income. So, during the past four or five years,  we  have  effectively  made
many teachers criminals because they have received additional payments,  and
they had not sought permission from the province.

Our aim, therefore, is to  reconcile  the  two  laws  -  the  Employment  of
Educators Act and now the Education Laws Amendment Bill, and to ensure  that
nobody is prejudiced, neither the governing body nor the individual  teacher
and, of course, nor the province.

So, the legislation therefore proposes a very  simple  formula.  Before  the
school governing body  makes  any  additional  payments  to  teachers,  they
should receive the approval of the provincial  department.  This,  in  turn,
will require certain steps, including the assurance,  for  the  first  time,
that all parents are aware of the intention. In other words,  this  must  be
presented to the school governing body. There is openness as to who  gets  a
top-up. Now we don't know who gets a top-up. It may depend on the  principal
having a favourite. I'm not just saying that; it may depend on that.  Or  it
may be like, for example, in a  particular  case  in  Mpumalanga  where  the
principal got free groceries, a free motor car, and holidays were  paid  for
out of the school funds. Now, it's very difficult to work  out  exactly  who
would give this kind of bonanza, this largess, this great gift  which  means
that every day is a Christmas day at this school in Mpumalanga.

There must be openness now about who gets a top-up, what it is for  and  how
much it entails. There are too many cases of  parents  not  being  aware  of
these matters, as in the Mpumalanga case, and the  payments  seem  to  be  a
case of perks.  Well,  perks  for  pals,  really,  determined  only  by  the
principal. This is undemocratic, contravenes  the  principal's  transparency
and the management of the school budget, contravenes  the  whole  spirit  of
the SA Schools Act, and is unacceptable.

Also, it imposes,  as  we  discovered  in  the  past  few  days,  inordinate
unregulated burdens on parents who may have no truck with  the  increase.  I
received a number of complaints from teachers who felt that payment to  some
created serious invidious challenges for many, because  they  couldn't  find
rational grounds as to why some teachers were given a top-up  and,  in  some
cases, of fairly considerable amounts - R15 000, R20 000, R25  000.  In  one
particular case of which I  am  aware,  three  childrens'  school  fees  for
university were paid for a teacher employed by the school.

Now provincial departments are required to ensure  that  top-ups  are  paid.
Top-ups/additional payments can be made, but only paid for genuine cases  of
extra work. Why do we say that? Well, state employees should never  be  paid
extra for doing the jobs for which they  are  already  paid  by  the  state.
Public servants and social  workers  are  not  paid  additional  amounts  of
money. Even my senior officials are not paid. Only where  there  are  duties
that go beyond the call of duty, such  as  additional  extra-mural,  out-of-
school-time activities  or  some  special  responsibilities  of  educational
leadership should departments give approval. An agreed set of criteria  will
be used by all the departments.

Yesterday, at the Council of Education Ministers, we  discussed  this  issue
because we don't want a vast bureaucratic exercise as to the  responsibility
of the provinces, and this only comes into force by next June.  All  schools
will have noticed the responsibility of the  provinces  as  to  how  quickly
they must act. This will ensure consistency in the application of the law.

I must also mention that we already have  a  performance  management  system
whereby good teachers can be rewarded. So, performance can be considered  as
a basis for  additional  rewards.  I  notice  the  official  opposition  has
published  a  document  called  ``Education  for  liberation'',   ``nogal'',
appropriating the word that comes from actual  forces  of  liberation.  They
propose that we should pay for performance-related work,  but  clearly,  the
official opposition does not understand existing Government policy. That  is
but one of the many misunderstandings of existing Government policy.

I am pleased to report  to  you,  for  those  pessimists  who  believe  that
requests for approval will be caught up in administrative tangles,  that  we
have built into the law an obligation for provincial  departments  to  reply
to any requests in a specified time, failing which the school may appeal  to
the MEC of the province, which means political responsibility.  I  can  also
report that we have already begun this plan of  implementation,  subject  to
the approval of this Council, to ensure that  we  have  a  uniform  approach
across province to the matter. It is my expectation that, over  time,  these
approvals will give us a good sense of where  there  are  pressures  in  the
system, which will allow us to  perhaps  respond  to  these  in  our  salary
negotiations with teacher unions, which would be the right thing to do.  Are
there  particular  pressures  on,  for  example,  maths  teachers,   science
teachers, if I may say so, and history teachers also? This is  something  we
can negotiate on with the teacher unions and the Education Labour  Relations
Council.
If schools  are  having  difficulty  getting  teachers  to  perform  certain
essential educational duties, and need to pay additional amounts  for  this,
we should look at this - whether the state should in fact not  be  providing
for such needs. This exercise will help us find out -  because  it's  mostly
men who get the additional payments,  I  regret  to  say.  Are  the  old-boy
networks working? Let's find out from the schools where  there  are  genuine
difficulties, either in performing certain  tasks  or  in  teaching  certain
subjects.

There has been a lot of mischief-making on  this  issue,  with  attempts  to
score political points by  misrepresenting  the  amendment.  Remember,  this
amendment is not for my department. It's  not  from  a  Minister.  It  is  a
resolution of the Council of Education Ministers from the provinces.

Newspaper headlines  of  the  particular  variety  in  Johannesburg  that  I
mentioned have echoed the uninformed cries of those who have benefited  from
the current arrangements, claiming that there is to be  a  ban  on  top-ups,
that there is a ``dumbing down''. This is a mindless word I read. Every  now
and then when there is progress and there is change and development for  the
better, more, by definition for these people, means worse, and they use  the
words ``dumbing down''. It must be a particularly South African  expression,
because I haven't heard this elsewhere.

This legislation proposes no such ban. It seeks to  ensure  that  additional
payments are properly planned and budgeted for, and that they  are  approved
by all parents of the school, and that the provincial departments are  aware
of the intention to do so.

I am sure that you will agree that this is not unreasonable in  the  context
of state employees in a public education system. As I have  said,  we  don't
allow any other public servant  to  receive  additional  payments  from  the
public, and this  is  a  special  dispensation  for  teachers.  So,  we  are
accepting the fact that teachers need  special  treatment.  If  a  policeman
does so, he would be charged  with  fraud.  I  cannot  imagine  any  private
sector employer agreeing to allow his/her employees  to  receive  additional
payments from someone else, because the governing body does not  employ  the
state teacher. We are creating an international precedent  in  allowing  for
this. This shows the reasonableness of both the ANC and  the  reasonableness
of my department that we are prepared to accept the precedent  arising  from
this rather peculiar situation in South Africa where we effectively have  an
education system which is divided in two parts - a more  affluent  education
system, and a system which we are trying to lift up by its bootstraps.

The least we can do, in allowing this practice to  continue,  is  to  ensure
that it is done in an  orderly  fashion,  with  the  full  approval  of  the
provincial departments as employers.

The Council is being  asked  to  take  a  stand  on  the  matter  of  public
education. Remember  this.  Some  political  parties  claim  to  defend  the
interests of public education, and then propose privatised  approaches  like
vouchers and tax exemptions. They speak for certain interests, and  vouchers
are a classic way of destroying the vast majority of the  schools  in  South
Africa.

I hope that in February, when we are in  session  again,  we  might  have  a
debate on the whole issue of giving parents vouchers like in a  supermarket;
you know, you get free vouchers which you can exchange for  some  goods,  as
if the children are intangible and schools are, of course,  made  of  bricks
and mortar.

This will undermine the very system of public education. A public  education
system has state-employed teachers at its core who are  accountable  to  the
provincial department of education for their work, and to the  community  at
large. The call by some parties to deregulate this environment and  allow  a
``free market'' for teachers will completely erode the  foundations  of  our
system, and result in a very messy  and  unfortunate  system  with  teachers
more concerned about pleasing the governing  body  than  in  performing  the
duties they are paid for.
I am sure you don't want our schools to move in that direction. I  therefore
call on you to support the Bill. As I  understand  it,  there  is  agreement
among all the provinces to support this Bill.

I end by saying while I am here, as there is no debate  on  the  other  Bill
before the House, that I will not be here to listen  to  the  chair  of  the
committee. I'm here to  call  on  you,  the  NCOP,  to  support  the  Higher
Education Amendment Bill. The  most  important  part  of  the  Bill  is  the
provision for the  establishment  of  the  national  institutes  for  higher
education in Mpumalanga and the Northern  Cape.  The  establishment  of  the
national institutes is a historic matter, not only because it signals a  new
beginning for higher  education,  but  also  because  it  introduces  a  new
institutional form. The national institutes for  higher  education  are  not
being established as independent higher education  institutions  as  is  the
case with existing universities and technikons. Instead, as is indicated  in
the National Plan for Higher Education, the national institutes  for  higher
education will serve as administrative and governance hubs for ensuring  the
coherent provision of higher education programmes in  response  to  regional
needs through programme collaboration between higher education  institutions
currently operating in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape.

The higher education needs of Mpumalanga  and  the  Northern  Cape  are  now
addressed as part  of  the  Government's  new  institutional  landscape  for
higher education. The needs of our people in all nine provinces will now  be
met.

I wish to thank the NCOP  for  supporting  the  Bill.  There  will  be  much
celebration amongst our people in Mpumalanga and  the  Northern  Cape.  They
will realise, of course, that this is a different form  of  delivery  taking
place in these two provinces.

I thank you for your  patience  and  your  forbearance,  Madam  Chairperson.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Minister, and Eid Mubarak to you.

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  we  sat  with
the Bill, the committee considered all those issues and we tabled  the  Bill
for adoption. We felt that we needed to make that clear upfront.

As we all know, the Bill before the House today has had no easy ride if  one
considers  the  extent   to   which   one   particular   clause   has   been
controversialised  by  those  who  represent  and  protect  narrow,  selfish
interests. However, as the ANC, who represent the overwhelming  majority  of
the  electorate  and  who  has  a  legitimate  mandate  to  scrutinise   any
appearance of unfair practice, we are guided by  the  constitutional  values
of equality, fairness and  justice  for  all.  Moreover,  we  have  a  moral
obligation to ensure that justice and fairness is seen to be upheld  in  our
country.

As the select committee, we have had numerous complaints from parents  about
their frustration of  paying  excessive  amounts  in  school  fees,  without
justification from school governing bodies as to how  the  money  is  spent.
Furthermore,  during  the  ministerial  investigation  into  the   cost   of
education in public schools, requests were made to the Minister to  regulate
the  additional  remuneration  to  state-employed  educators  by   governing
bodies. It has also  surfaced  that,  in  some  schools,  parents  are  kept
uninformed about amounts paid to such educators and of the reason  for  such
additional remuneration. The Minister has already alluded to this.  Some  of
these instances have led to  court  cases,  especially  in  instances  where
incoming school  governing  bodies  are  refusing  to  honour  the  unlawful
obligations of the outgoing SGB.

As far as we are concerned, the school governing body is  not  the  employer
of educators, except for those educators employed by the governing  body  in
terms of section 20(4) of the SA Schools Act.  If  the  school  requires  an
additional educator,  the  post  should  be  created  in  a  systematic  and
transparent manner, which is reflected in the budget. The burden should  not
be shifted to the parents. The main objective of this amendment  is  not  to
ban extra remuneration, but to curb the irresponsible manner in which it  is
done. Moreover, the only proper way of paying such  remuneration  would  be,
first and foremost, to seek the approval  of  the  department.  Examples  of
such kinds are topping-up, which the Minister has already  indicated  and  I
would not like to repeat that.

The other amendment includes an increase in the number of members of the  SA
Qualifications Authority nominated by  the  organised  teaching  profession.
This  is  done  to  ensure  that  all  unions  have  equal   representation.
Furthermore, the Bill provides for errant teachers to appeal to  the  Member
of the Executive Committee or the Minister in  the  event  of  inconsistency
during findings of a disciplinary nature.

Quite often teachers find that they are up against  presiding  officers  who
have axes to grind or scores to settle. We trust that this amendment to  the
Employment of Educators Act will ensure greater fairness in these matters.

Lastly, we welcome the provision that effects the change of the General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Council,  better  known  as
GENFETQA, to  Umalusi.  Already  I  feel  much  more  comfortable  with  the
pronunciation, after having had to come to  terms  with  what  really  is  a
tongue twister. We support this wholeheartedly. Thank you.

Mr J MAFEREKE (Free State):  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson.  Minister  Kader
Asmal and members of the Council, it is indeed an honour for me to  have  an
opportunity to speak in this House for the first time. [Applause.]

This Bill amends four Acts and they are as follows:  The  SA  Qualifications
Authority Act, Act 58 of 1995; the SA Schools  Act,  Act  84  of  1996;  the
Employment of Educators Act, Act 76 of 1998; and  the  General  and  Further
Education and Training Quality Assurance Act, Act 58 of 2001.

However, I will agree with other members in support  of  the  Bill,  but  we
want to concentrate on number one, because  the  rest  are  more  technical.
School governing bodies, I think, is a thorn in the flesh to everybody.

We from the Free State support these amendments in totality for  the  simple
reason that they have actually closed  the  gaps  that  were  there  before,
which created many problems for educators and were open to  abuse  at  times
by  other  institutions  like  school   governing   bodies.   Without   even
considering other Acts like the Labour Relations Act and the  Employment  of
Educators Act, these school governing  bodies  would  take  decisions  which
suited them and they would  implement  these  decisions  without  any  other
consultation.

When their term of office ended, the newly elected members of the board  had
no obligation to honour the decisions that were implemented by the  previous
governing bodies. This created conflicts which warranted the  department  to
intervene, but how should the department intervene when it was not  part  of
the decisions taken, which neglected other laws that  the  department  would
have considered if it were  part  of  the  decision  making  process?  As  a
result, the department found itself having the problem as it was not a  part
from the beginning.

Therefore, these amendments are trying to regulate school  governing  bodies
to apply their minds in considering other laws, before making any  decisions
regarding payment of any  kind  to  educators,  and  also  to  engage  other
departments with their proposal before their budgets are  finalised  by  the
school. In that sense, all the factors that  will  have  an  impact  on  the
decisions taken will  be  considered  before  approval  is  granted  by  the
department. Therefore, the employment of educators should really and  solely
rest with the department.

Finally, the rest of the amendments for  the  above-mentioned  Acts  that  I
have not spoken about are more technical in nature and we are in support  of
them. As I have said, they are only closing the gaps that  have  been  there
before. Before I rest my case, I want to comment to  the  Chairperson  about
when I came to this department. Being a chairperson of education I  met  the
MEC of education and he talked  about  Umalusi.  I  thought  Umalusi  was  a
person. When is she coming? [Laughter.] Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I understand,  hon  member.  Umalusi  is
almost here. [Laughter.]

Mr F ADAMS: Voorsitter, agb lede en agb Minister, u weet  ...  [Chairperson,
hon members and hon Minister, you know ...]

... on the Cape Flats they have a saying when they want a  person  to  focus
...

... dan sê hulle: ``Jy moet bietjie wakker  skrik'',  of  ``Jy  vat  bietjie
lank om wakker te skrik.'' Ek wil vir Minister Asmal sê ek weet  nie  of  hy
'n bietjie lank gevat het om wakker te skrik, en of  hy  nog  die  hele  tyd
wakker was, maar die ding net 'n bietjie uitgerek het nie, maar baie  dankie
vir die buigsame manier ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[... then they say: ``You must wake up'' or ``You are  taking  too  long  to
wake up''. I want to say to Minister Asmal that I do  not  know  whether  he
took too long to wake up, or whether he has been awake all  along  and  just
dragged things out a little, but thank you for the flexible manner ....]

... in which you take things into consideration  and  how  you  address  the
Bill. The new Bill shows more support for giving power to  school  governing
bodies with regard to deciding  on  extra  remuneration.  It  leans  towards
supporting this. The Bill stipulates that  extra  remuneration  may  not  be
unreasonably refused. The initial version of the Bill seems to want  to  put
an end to extra remuneration paid by  governing  bodies  to  teachers.  This
Bill will regulate extra remuneration and will ensure that  it  takes  place
in a legal and transparent manner.

Provinsiale  departemente  sal  moet  seker  maak  dat  die  prosedures  wat
voorsiening maak vir ekstra vergoeding  aan  onderwysers  op  'n  regverdige
manier geïmplementeer word en dat hulle gereed is om dit te hanteer.

Die Nuwe NP steun die  wetgewing.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Provincial departments will have to ensure that the procedures  which  make
provision for extra remuneration to  teachers  are  implemented  in  a  fair
manner and that they are ready to deal with this.

The New NP supports the legislation. I thank you.]

Mr K PANDAY (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, the objective of the  Bill  is  to
provide amendments to a series of Acts of Parliament  in  order  to  clarify
matters pertaining to various clauses associated with  them,  and  to  cover
matters which were not provided for by the existing provisions of the  Acts.
The hon Minister has explained precisely what the objective of the Bill is.

Thus, in terms of the SA Qualifications Authority Act, the amendments  cater
for the increase of trade union representation in the Authority from two  to
three, and for the retention of members of the Authority  due  to  expertise
and experience pertaining to the work of the body.  We  support  this.  Thus
its functions are not interrupted unnecessarily.

In terms of the  South  African  Schools  Act,  it  amends  several  clauses
associated with the remuneration of educators, the  role  and  functions  of
the  school  governing  bodies  which  are   clarified   sufficiently,   and
additionally the Act clarifies serious misrepresentations  and  unauthorised
remuneration practices that have surfaced in various instances.

In this instance, especially in regard to section 38  of  the  Act,  several
key issues touched upon by  the  amendments  are  of  crucial  significance,
especially those associated  with  the  remuneration  of  educators.  It  is
important to emphasise the costs associated with additional remuneration  of
our educators, as it has become common knowledge that large numbers  of  our
best educational practitioners are lured by better  financial  prospects  in
places such as the United Kingdom and Australia.
Research conducted by the Human Science Research Council and the  University
of Cape Town have painted a very  serious  picture  regarding  our  educator
migration. Yesterday's Daily News in the Kwazulu-Natal province,  and  I  am
sure other newspapers, revealed startling information about  the  attractive
salaries and perks offered to our teachers - more than  double  what  we  in
South Africa are paying them. These are in overseas countries like  the  UK.
If this continues, South Africa will be losing many  of  the  cream  of  our
educators and there will most certainly be a brain drain.

Hence, it is important for us to consider our  educators  reaping  financial
and other benefits due to them, after the correct rules and  procedures  are
followed. I want to emphasise that proper guidelines must be in place.

The Act also clarifies  the  relationship  between  the  state  authorities,
various stakeholders and key role-players vis-à vis unfair labour and  other
practices emanating from the Employment of Educators Act  of  1998  and  the
Public Service Act of 1994. The amendments are based  on  concrete  examples
of legal cases that have created precedents. Thus there was a dire  need  of
reformulation in order for tensions and conflicts  to  be  remedied  in  the
best possible way. Such processes will  guarantee  that  the  principles  of
fair and equal payment for work done will  be  applied  consistently  across
the system. Additional remuneration  for  additional  work  done  should  be
considered.

These educators should be rewarded for their  sacrifice,  time,  effort  and
money spent in ensuring that the learners  benefit  from  their  experience.
However, the most important factor will be  to  set  proper  guidelines  and
rules. This aspect must not be abused. There must be  legal  control.  These
guidelines must spell out the procedures to be followed, the  amount  to  be
paid, etc. All these must be  done  in  concurrence  with  the  unions,  the
governing bodies and other stakeholders in education.

These important components must be kept fully appraised of  developments  in
the department. We must ensure that these rules  and  regulations  are  done
collectively.  No  one  must  be  in  the  dark.  Full   participation   and
transparency must be adopted in order to reach an acceptable compromise.

The Employment of Educators Act has been amended in terms of  the  processes
associated with appointment of educators to be found in the  Education  Laws
Amendment Act of 2002.  It  clarifies  the  systems  and  the  role  of  the
provincial  minister  of  education,  the  presiding   officer   and   other
authorities  in  cases  of  misconduct,  appeals  and  general   rules   and
procedures.

In  terms  of  the  General  and  Further  Education  and  Training  Quality
Assurance Act, the name  of  the  General  and  Training  Quality  Assurance
Council was changed to Umalusi, which means shepherd in  Nguni,  as  it  was
considered unsatisfactory and cumbersome. We, from the province of  KwaZulu-
Natal, support this.

Our province  is  satisfied  with  the  amendments,  as  the  technical  and
substantial adjustments provided clarify key issues and  details  associated
with certain provisions of these Acts. We support the Bill. I thank you.

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, may I start by wishing you  a  happy  Eid  Mubarak.  Hon
Chair, hon Minister, hon special delegates and hon colleagues, I would  just
like to make a brief comment on the reference made by the hon Minister to  a
newspaper editorial that was critical about the matric pass rate. I want  to
hasten to assure the hon Minister that the DA certainly does  not  entertain
those kinds of sentiments. We, in  fact,  welcome  any  improvement  in  our
matriculation pass rate.

The Bill seeks to  amend  the  following  Acts,  namely  the  South  African
Qualifications Authority Act, 1995; the South  African  Schools  Act,  1996;
the  Employment  of  Educators  Act,  1998;  and  the  General  and  Further
Education and Training Quality  Assurance  Act,  2001,  which  the  Minister
quite rightly said was a mouthful.

These amendments are intended to enable the national Minister  of  Education
to regulate certain policy areas for public and independent  schools,  areas
such as the appointment  of  certain  categories  of  teachers;  a  national
process  for  the  assessment,  monitoring  and   evaluation   for   quality
education; norms and standards for school funding; and the admission age  of
a learner to public and independent schools, among other things.

At first glance, the lowering of the  age  of  admission  of  a  learner  to
public and independent schools will  be  welcomed  by  most  parents.  South
Africa thus falls more in line with international practice. The lowering  of
the age of admission is certainly a progressive step, but  some  worry  does
exist.  Do  our  rural  communities  enjoy  adequate  Grade  R   facilities,
preprimary infrastructure and human resources?

However, the  area  of  special  concern  to  the  DA  is  the  question  of
incentives paid to  educators.  In  principle,  all  educators  employed  by
provincial departments must be remunerated within  the  same  salary  ranges
and on  the  same  salary  level  for  similar  duties.  Why  does  the  ANC
Government now consider it unfair and  inappropriate  for  educators  to  be
given additional monetary incentives? Must recognition of excellence in  the
performance by  our  educators  be  decried,  declared  unlawful?  Generally
speaking, it is true that a school governing body is not the employer of  an
educator, except in special circumstances.

In the Education White Paper 2 of 1996,  the  national  Ministry  introduced
the proposal for a radically new system of education in South Africa.  These
proposals  were  highlighted  by  the  introduction  of  the  principle   of
ownership of the school by the community  it  serves  -  of  a  genuine  and
binding partnership between a local community and  a  provincial  department
of education, and so the concept of school governing bodies was born.

For reasons of accountability,  provincial  education  departments  have  to
play limited roles in the governance of schools. That paper was  a  founding
document of the ANC Government. Why, then, does it now  have  this  itch  to
circumscribe the powers of school governing bodies? This is  nothing  but  a
naked attempt to erode the central power of a community's  school  governing
body - the right of parents to  decide  who  should  teach  their  children.
[Interjections.] The Ministry does not want good teachers to be  remunerated
with extra incentives. Is this really the way to ensure that equality  among
educators is brought about? What is certain is that mediocrity  will  become
the   norm.   [Interjections.]   Disillusioned   educators   and   committed
professionals will be forced to seek greener pastures elsewhere.

In its indecent haste to introduce  transformation  via  the  instrument  of
affirmative action, many of our  excellent  teachers  in  subjects  such  as
maths and science were given settlement packages  and  sent  out  to  graze.
South Africa can ill afford to lose good teachers,  especially  in  subjects
such as maths, science, information technology and accounting.  Let  us  not
sacrifice   excellence   at   the   feet   of    ideological    imperatives.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.]
Adv A H GAUM (Western Cape): Madam Chair, on behalf of the House,  you  will
allow me to congratulate the Minister of Education on  his  fourth  position
on the list of a certain party.

The question of extra remuneration for  teachers  has  generated  sharp  and
extensive debate. The initial version of the Bill was rightly criticised  by
us and others as it created the impression that it wanted to put an  end  to
the so-called perks that are paid  by  governing  bodies  to  teachers.  Our
concern was that  some  of  our  well-qualified  teachers  would  leave  the
profession and be lost to education. Fortunately, the version  of  the  Bill
before this House today is a much-improved one, and it  seems  that  the  DA
hasn't seen that there has been a  change  as  far  as  this  is  concerned.
[Interjections.]

This Bill attempts to regulate extra remuneration and attempts to make  sure
that such remuneration takes place in  a  legal  manner  that  is  open  and
transparent. We would like to thank Minister Asmal and  his  department  for
listening to our inputs  and  for  amending  the  Bill  accordingly.  As  we
requested, the Bill now has clear criteria that the  employer  has  to  take
into account when considering applications  from  schools.  It  also  states
that such applications must not unreasonably be refused.

We are also pleased with the new right of appeal to the  MECs  of  provinces
if approval has been denied  to  a  governing  body  with  regard  to  extra
remuneration, or when the  employer  fails  to  provide  a  decision  on  an
application within three months after the lodging of the application in  the
office of the employer.

We are on record as supporting the principle that teachers may receive  fair
extra remuneration when they take on extra responsibility  and  extra  work.
Governing bodies should have the right to reward  the  extra  mile  that  so
many teachers are willing to go, although we  should  also  acknowledge,  at
the same  time,  that  all  governing  bodies  are  not  in  such  fortunate
positions, something that the DA also forgets from time to time.

Skoolbeheerrade moet die reg hê om onderwysers en hoofde  vir  ekstra  harde
werk, toewyding en prestasie op 'n billike en regverdige manier  te  beloon.
Dit strook volledig met die beginsel wat ek ook onderskryf,  net  soos  daar
vir volgehoue mislukking vervolging behoort te wees. Ekstra  harde  werk  en
toewyding moet beloon word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Governing bodies should have the right to reward  teachers  and  principals
for extra hard work, dedication and achievement in a fair and  just  manner.
This is completely in line with the  principle  I  also  endorse,  that  for
continued  failure  there  should  be  prosecution.  Extra  hard  work   and
dedication must be rewarded.]

However, one must be mindful of the fact that there are  many  schools  that
are not able to  afford  and  offer  extra  remuneration  because  of  their
financial situations. Therefore, one must understand that this is  a  matter
that has to be dealt with sensitively. For this reason it is very  important
that extra remuneration be provided in a fair and justifiable manner.

We  cannot  encourage   extravagant   expenditure   and   we   must   ensure
transparency. Parents must know what the school fees  they  are  paying  are
being used for. They must be fully informed pertaining to  the  contents  of
budgets. This will enable parents to take their SGBs  to  task.  This,  once
again, emphasises the importance of  parents  becoming  involved  in  school
governing bodies to ensure that funds are indeed spent well.  Through  SGBs,
our parents should ensure that they are not priced out of schools.

The challenge that remains is that of implementation.  National  departments
and provincial departments now have the responsibility to  ensure  that  the
procedures that allow for extra remuneration are implemented in a  fair  and
effective  manner.  However,  the  detailed  procedures  to  implement   the
legislation in this regard must be  drafted  as  a  matter  of  urgency  and
provided to schools to enable school governing  bodies  to  finalise  school
budgets next year.

I am therefore pleased to have seen  evidence  at  yesterday's  CEM  meeting
that the process to finalise these regulations  and  procedures  is  already
under  way.  We  will  have  to  be  very   careful   to   prevent   massive
administrative bottlenecks and ensure that the process is as simple  and  as
least cumbersome as possible. We as a province support the  Bill,  and  also
the other amendments.

In conclusion, I would like to thank our teachers for  their  commitment  to
making education work in  our  country.  As  the  future  starts  here  with
education, you are indeed building the foundation for the  future,  together
with many parents who give up a lot of their time to be  involved  in  their
children's education. Although many of our teachers may never receive  extra
remuneration from SGBs, we would like to thank them for their hard work  and
commitment. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mnu  H  T  SOGONI:  Sihlalo  obekekileyo,   Mphathiswa   weSebe   lezeMfundo
ohloniphekileyo, boogxa bam, manenekazi namanene,  ngokugunyaziswa  liphondo
leMpuma Koloni,  ndiphakamela  ukuvakalisa  inkxaso  yeli  phondo  kuphumezo
lwalo Mthetho uYilwayo siwuxoxayo ngale njikalanga.

IKomiti yephondo ejongene nemicimbi yezeMfundo ithe yahlala yaphonononga  lo
Mthetho uYilwayo, yazivelela zonke iinkalo  namasolotya  abalulekileyo  athe
ayithundezela kwisigqibo sokuxhasa lo Mthetho uYilwayo. Kodwa ke,  ukuqinisa
inkxaso yethu siliphondo  leMpuma  Koloni,  ndinqwenela  ukwenza  la  mabal'
engwe ngalo Mthetho uYilwayo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Mr H T SOGONI: Hon Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Education,  colleagues,
ladies and gentlemen, I have been mandated by the province  of  the  Eastern
Cape to express its support for the Bill being debated this afternoon.

The provincial committee on education sat and analysed this Bill,  and  took
note of  all  the  important  aspects  concerning  it,  which  prompted  the
committee to support it. However, in supporting the Bill, as a  province,  I
wish to highlight the following aspects regarding it.]

Chairperson, let me devote my time to the amendment of section 38 of the  SA
Schools Act, which deals with the prohibition  of  payment  of  unauthorised
remuneration or giving of financial benefit or benefit in  kind  to  certain
employees. This amendment has been the subject of intense debate during  the
briefings, both in the select committee of the  NCOP,  as  well  as  in  the
standing committees on education in some of the provinces.

In order to follow and understand some of the arguments on  this  particular
amendment, we should acknowledge that section 7(2) of  the  Constitution  of
the Republic of  South  Africa  requires  the  state  to  respect,  protect,
promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights,  as  enshrined  in  our
Constitution. Hence the state, in terms of section 29(1),  should  make  the
right to education available and accessible to everyone.
One of the functions of the governing body of a public school, in  terms  of
section 20(1)(a) of the South African Schools Act, is to  promote  the  best
interest of the school and to strive to ensure its development  through  the
provision of quality education for all learners at the school.

The SA Schools Act also places a responsibility on both the  state  and  the
school governing body to provide the school with resources.  The  state,  on
the one hand, should fund public schools  in  order  to  ensure  the  proper
exercise of the rights of all learners, while the  governing  body,  on  the
other hand, supplements the resources supplied by  the  state  in  order  to
improve the quality of education provided by the school to all learners.

In terms of section 3(2) of the Employment of Educators  Act,  the  Minister
is the employer of all educators for purposes of determining their  salaries
and other conditions of service, subject to the Labour Relations Act or  any
collective agreement made in the Education Labour Relations Council.
Similarly, the appointment or promotion of any educator  in  the  Department
of Education is made by the Director-General or, in the case  of  provinces,
by the head of department. All these provisions I  have  referred  to  above
are very important and should be carefully considered when we  look  at  the
merits or defects, if any, of this particular amendment.

Against this background, therefore, our understanding of the content of  the
amendment is that the school governing body's authority or role  to  act  in
the  best  interests  of  the  school  has  neither  been   undermined   nor
diminished. Our view is that the intention of the  proposed  legislation  is
to regulate any payment of additional remuneration. The purpose  is  to  set
conditions and requirements that would be equally applicable  to  all  cases
when the need arises for such additional remuneration, while  ensuring  that
proper and  sufficient  consultation  of  the  relevant  role-players  takes
place.

In this regard, parents will be involved in the process, as subsection 4  of
the amendment provides for the  SGB  to  submit  its  application  for  such
additional remuneration of an educator  at  least  four  months  before  the
finalisation of the school's annual budget, as approved by parents.

Subsection 8 of the amendment also requires that such payment  be  reflected
in  the  school's  budget.  Parents,  therefore,  shall   have   had   ample
opportunity to participate in  the  decision  towards  the  payment  of  any
remuneration or benefit by the school. They will also be fully aware of  its
financial implications when they finalise the annual budget.

Apha, Sihlalo obekekileyo, ndicela ukubeka umnwe kwindawo asele  eyinyathele
uMphathiswa, eyinxaxheba yabazali kwizinto ezilolu hlobo. kwiindawo  esisuka
kuzo sinamava ngeemeko apho  abazali  bangenalwazi  lokuba  kuqhubeka  ntoni
ezikolweni  ngeemali  zabo.  Kungoko  ke  sisithi  kubalulekile  okokuba  lo
mthetho ubethelelwe.

Kodwa, ngaphezu  koko,  ikhona  inxaxheba  emasiyidlale  siliSebe  leMfundo,
singala malungu singawo,  singabo  bonke  abantu  abanenxaxheba  emfundweni,
ukuze abazali, ikakhulu kwelaa cala lethu elisuka kulaa  ngcinezelo  indala,
benziwe bazi ukuba yinxaxheba  yabo  ukujonga  okokuba  kuqhubeka  ntoni  na
ezikolweni zabo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Here, hon Chairperson,  I  wish  to  highlight  one  aspect  that  the  hon
Minister has touched on, namely parents' support in matters of this  nature.
Our experience is that where we come from parents know  nothing  about  what
is happening to the moneys they pay to their children's  schools.  For  that
reason we say that when this law is passed it should be given prominence.

Furthermore, we have a role to play as Education department, as  members  of
Parliament, as  all  the  stakeholders  in  education,  to  make  sure  that
parents, more especially in the areas we  come  from,  with  its  oppressive
background, know that it is their duty to know what is  happening  in  their
children's schools.]
Chairperson, the amendment also serves to give the  department,  as  another
important role-player, an opportunity to test the need  for  any  additional
remuneration or benefit, to  scrutinise  the  process  of  payment  of  such
additional remuneration and to  ensure  that  equity  and  transparency  are
taken into account.

School governing bodies should also be satisfied that the employer  may  not
unreasonably refuse an application by an SGB. The SGB  may  also  appeal  to
the MEC if the application is unreasonably refused  or  a  decision  is  not
taken within three months after the lodging  of  the  application  with  the
employer. Such measures in this Bill are therefore  supported  in  order  to
guard against abuse of authority by the department.

In conclusion, the province of the Eastern Cape supports this  and  all  the
other amendments proposed in this Bill, together with  the  amendments  that
were proposed by the select committee during deliberations on this  Bill.  I
thank you. [Applause.]
Ms M P THEMBA: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, as the  ANC  we  are  indeed
proud today to again reaffirm our commitment to our  objectives  and  vision
that we set for ourselves as a nation more than nine  years  ago.  As  South
Africans, we should rightly feel proud of  what  we  have  achieved  in  our
country in this short space of time. Our democratic order is premised  on  a
constitution which is the envy of the democratic world.

On the  education  front,  we  have  made  tremendous  strides  through  our
collective efforts involving educators,  parents,  learners,  civil  society
and NGOs. We have  managed  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  and
restored the dignity  and  integrity  of  our  schools,  which  were  solely
lacking because of the ravages of apartheid  -  Raju.  It  is  against  this
background that we can justifiable pronounce that we have turned the tide.

Allow us then to  briefly  examine  the  progress,  both  qualitatively  and
quantitatively, that we have made since  1994.  Firstly,  and  perhaps  most
importantly,  there  is  the  successful  dismantling  of   17   dilapidated
education  departments  and  transforming  them  into  a  single  integrated
education system.

The complexities of this project were indeed massive, and in some  instances
we are all  haunted  by  its  legacy.  Nevertheless,  we  believe  that  the
commitment to building on this foundation is indeed reflected in the  manner
in which the national Department of Education, together with its  provincial
counterparts, are tracking the remaining challenges.

Furthermore, we have improved access through  accelerated  participation  of
previously  and  presently  underserviced  and   marginalised   communities.
Although participation is not at the  maximum  level  yet,  particularly  in
early childhood programmes, adult education and training, further  education
and training, as well as higher education  and  training,  it  is  certainly
pushing towards the desired levels. This is reflected  particularly  in  the
steady increase in enrolment in  the  reception  year,  with  the  enrolment
figures increasing from approximately 150 000 to 280 000  between  1999  and
2002, which suggests that full enrolment will  be  reached  by  2015.  Gross
secondary enrolment is  currently  approximately  85%,  which  indicates  an
increase of 15% from 1992. Yes, the facts speak for themselves.

The improvement and more  equitable  distribution  of  key  learner  inputs,
including infrastructure development and learner support material,  as  well
as  educational  provisions  in  general,  have  improved  equity   in   all
provinces, including Mpumalanga and  the  Eastern  Cape.  For  example,  key
physical infrastructure,  such  as  toilets  and  sanitation,  has  improved
significantly.  This  has  been  achieved   through   improvement   in   the
distribution  of  resources  through  the  targeted  intervention,  pro-poor
resourcing  and  a  formula-driven  allocation  of  educator  resources,  as
opposed to the racially-driven model of pre-1994.

Having said that,  investment  infrastructure,  learning  support  material,
equitable teacher allocation and upgrading and development  remain  high  on
the education agenda, as  demonstrated  in  the  growth  in  investment  and
information on  service  delivery  as  recorded  in  the  national  schools'
register of needs survey carried out between 1996 and 2000.

We continue  to  make  progress  in  HIV/Aids  interventions.  The  national
department released  its  national  policy  on  HIV/Aids  for  learners  and
educators in public schools in 1999 already. This  policy  is  augmented  by
life-skills programmes and other resource material.

We weathered an onslaught from an opposition that is hell-bent  on  fighting
back, but the question is: Against what? It is because of that fact that  we
have, since 1994, enhanced quality in education,  increased  efficiency  and
stability and ensured democratic participation in governance.

I won't dwell much on the Bill as  all  my  other  colleagues  have  already
spoken on it.

In conclusion, to us the Bill before this House today represents  a  further
consolidation of our gains and will contribute to the broader  programme  of
our Government's unwavering efforts to eliminate  inequities  that  continue
to bedevil our democratic society. The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Chairperson, first of  all,  let  me  thank
all members  of  the  House  and  all  members  of  the  provinces  for  the
overwhelming  support  they've  shown  for  the  Bill.  I  think  they  have
understood the educational and social policy behind it.

Let me respond by stating one or two general principles. First of  all,  the
ANC has been accused of arrogance and appropriating power at the centre  and
that we use our majority in Parliament to  steamroll  legislation.  When  we
actually consult with the public, we engage with them and take into  account
serious legitimate points of view, like we've done over the  Electoral  Laws
Amendment Bill. The engagement among the three  political  parties  resulted
this morning in the Government accepting certain amendments which will  come
to the House.

Then we are accused of evasion,  of  lack  of  certainty  in  our  position,
virtually moral weakness. Let me say  right  at  the  beginning,  therefore,
that the fundamental assumptions of this Bill have  not  diverged  since  we
introduced it to the Council of Education Ministers. There was  no  question
of banning extra payment in the original Bill. There was no question of  it.
It never arose.

What we are trying to remove is the illegality of teachers being  forced  to
accept money - a  really  serious  matter  -  without  the  consent  of  the
province.

The second point was that it was totally unregulated. Mr Raju, I  will  come
to you in a moment. If you look at a newspaper cutting  from  a  teacher  in
Mitchell's Plain, this is the pain of genuine inequality. There needs to  be
some kind of criterion  that  takes  into  account  the  consideration  that
poorer schools cannot afford to pay teachers more.

Money talks. If parents are able to dig deeper into their pockets,  it  will
show in the matric results. So, we are trying  not  to  create  an  entirely
egalitarian society, because we are  a  mixed  economy  and  there  will  be
differentials.

What we are trying to do, hon Mr Raju,  is  to  ensure  that  those  at  the
bottom of the pile are able, through  education  and  public  good  and  the
notion of public education, to lift themselves up.

We have a special relationship with the New NP, and therefore  I  won't  say
what Mr Adams meant by ``Shall I wake up? Have I woken  up?''  Well,  if  he
wasn't a member of the New NP, I could have said ``What do you think  I  am?
Rumpelstiltskin, who woke up suddenly and got so  angry,  he  hit  into  the
ground and the ground swallowed him up?''. I would say that Mr Adams was  Mr
Rumpelstiltskin who woke up. Because we have a fraternal  relationship  with
the New NP, I will not make such  a  statement  at  all.  [Laughter.]  I  am
always awake to put the interests of education and our children first.

The third point is that I would like to  congratulate  the  hon  speaker.  I
don't know why he was called a ``maiden speaker''; he is so big -  that  is,
the hon Mafereka who hardly qualifies to be a ``maiden'' by any  description
but  for  his  first  speech!  I  congratulate  him  on  his  first  speech.
[Laughter.]

Hon Mr Panday, the question of our  recruitment  of  teachers,  doctors  and
nurses is not new. We are the ones who established in  Edinburgh  that  over
the past two years 4 000 teachers have left. What we have  now  done  is  to
ensure that corrective measures have been taken. We will  see  what  happens
next year. No teacher will get leave of absence in the middle  of  the  year
so that they can go and teach overseas. No teacher will get that. A  teacher
must resign from the job. That will make a big difference.

You might talk about the attractive salaries and perks. What we  established
in Scotland, when the Ministers of  the  Commonwealth  met,  is  that  these
recruitment agents don't tell them anything about the  appalling  conditions
under which they will work; that glorified monitors  and  policemen  in  the
inner cities - blacks - are sent to inner cities  to  work  in  England,  as
well as in the United States. They  are  not  told  about  the  disciplinary
matters, and yesterday we discussed discipline in our schools  and,  in  the
Council of Education Ministers meeting, we said how proud we were about  the
improvement of general discipline in South Africa.  I  will  come  to  that.
They are not told about the cost of living in those  places;  they  are  not
told about the cost of transport;  the  cost  of  basic  things  like  meat,
accommodation, the general unfriendliness and the awful  weather.  They  are
not told about the awful weather. Some of us have lived through that for  35
years, and will know what the weather's like. Seriously, the  fact  is  that
there is a three-year contract only, and the  visa  is  not  extended  after
that. They are not told about these things.

That is  why  we  are  going  to  have  a  code  of  conduct  in  the  whole
Commonwealth, which I hope Australia, New Zealand, Canada and  Britain  will
sign, to say that all this information must be available. We  are  also  not
going to allow - let me say for the first time - recruitment agencies to  go
into our universities and recruit people there, because these people  seduce
our students from the universities, and we are not going to  allow  that.  I
am going to appeal to the  universities  not  to  allow  that  situation  to
happen.

Hon Mr Raju, it's not fair. I have the highest consideration for  you  as  a
former teacher. However, you see, when you spoke today, it reminded me  that
this is a parliamentary setting. It reminded me of the  marine  plain  of  a
malala payipini lurching on a Saturday night. [Laughter.]  He  lurched  from
the right to the left,  and  he  took  up  the  SA  Schools  Act  and  spoke
discursively and irrelevantly about the SA Schools  Act.  Suddenly,  he  saw
the light and he went to the Edward Hotel, the  rich  man's  bastion.  Then,
suddenly, all  his  class-consciousness  came  out.  He  represents  certain
interests - rich interests - and then suddenly he  supports  empowerment  of
local authorities. This is extraordinary. At the same time, he'll allow  the
same governing bodies that he says shouldn't  be  affected  to  have  racist
policies around employment of teachers, not  to  have  indigenous  languages
being taught there, no interference in the culture and the ethos of  schools
which we discussed in the Council of  Education  Ministers  yesterday;  when
children want soccer, they are forced  to  play  bootcamp  sports  alien  to
their traditions. Maybe they should go into the  cold  lakes  in  Thabazimbi
and they might learn some backbone, like our  rugby  players  really  learnt
some backbone - didn't they - when they went to Australia.

Please, hon Mr Raju, there is a schizophrenia  in  your  position.  You  are
part of the great progressive movements about how the  reform  of  education
is taking place, the  philosophy  behind  the  SA  Schools  Act  of  equity,
fairness, high standards and equality. At the same  time,  you  mouth  these
extraordinary words as if excellence only vests in those  schools  that  are
paying thousands and thousands extra.

Let me take you with me at the beginning of January.  I  will  take  you  to
township schools that are the best-performing schools in  South  Africa.  In
March, I will invite you  to  the  most  improved  schools.  These  are  not
schools that are paying R15 000  to  R20  000  extra  illegally.  There  are
schools in Phola Park and Ivory Park who have some of the  best  results  in
South Africa. The middle-class Africans now want to go  to  the  schools  in
the townships because the schools are so damn good. I will  take  you  along
to Ms Sithole's school, a run-down school in  Atteridgeville,  and  she  has
really transformed it into a paradise where  they  sell  vegetables  to  the
public, feed the kids every day with a hot meal, got a computer centre  from
the Japanese, got a learning centre from a company and, in fact, the  school
is a model. She got the award for the best lifetime performance when we  had
the awards.

We  are  working  with  teachers,  black  and  white,  in  early   childhood
education, and give them no money inducements. The  pride  that  they  take,
black and white, to say that they've been recognised  is  enough.  So,  I'll
invite you to the most improved school award to see.

One of the awards is the most  integrated  school  award,  a  new  award  we
introduced. Again, you have to visit these schools to see that  they  are  a
kind of South Africa at peace. Please, excellence does not reside  in  those
schools that have a particular approach to doing things.

Let me end by saying on this point that  this  high  fees  issue  is  really
affecting all classes of people. I've got scores of  letters.  If  you  have
worked in other parts of the world, you would realise  that  some  of  these
schools that charge R15 000 or R20 000 - the private  schools  are  entitled
to charge the R17 000 and R18 000 that they do - don't  recognise  that  you
don't need much of the fripperies  in  the  school  you  have.  They  should
recognise that standards are not associated with a  certain  way  you  speak
English; standards are not associated with a certain  kind  of  culture  you
have in the hall. Remember, the vast majority of  schools  in  South  Africa
don't have a hall. Standards are not maintained by ensuring  that  you  send
your football team to Europe every other  year,  or  send  the  teachers  to
Europe every year. Standards are not maintained by having a particular  form
of decorum, a particular way of treating the whole  school  and  the  school
environment.

We must learn now to ensure that we create South African  schools  with  the
highest standards. I want the  values  of  Phola  Park,  remarkable  values,
transmitted to other schools, because  they  are  really  nonracial  values.
They are really values that are South African,  and  where  the  heroes  and
heroines are not Lord Nelson and Wellington and others,  as  I  have  found,
but Mrs Harriet Colenso, the great  egalitarian  fighter  against  Shepstone
and the colonial racism in KwaZulu-Natal. I say these things, because  there
is another world outside, genuinely trying to grapple with what it is  being
a South African now.

That is why I think you must, like the editor of this  morning's  newspaper,
realise that excellence does not reside in the way  you  speak  English  and
the way you walk in the foothills of  Table  Mountain,  that  there  is,  in
fact, excellence elsewhere in South Africa,  in  Afrikaans  schools.  Former
Afrikaans schools are really  grappling  with  dual-medium  education  where
they are learning  Afrikaans  and  isiXhosa  in  Soweto,  as  I  found  this
morning, where they are learning three languages in school. This  is  really
remarkable. They are trying to posit themselves in the cultural, social  and
linguistic milieu of South Africa. Now, that's the world, hon Mr Raju,  that
you should look at.

There is no itch here. We don't have an itch at all. We  don't  itch  to  do
anything. We are carrying out a policy of - I have a yellow book here -  the
ANC from 1993. It's now 10 years, and there's a kind of seamless  thread  in
carrying out the remarkable policy.

My hon sister Themba mentioned that we have a participation rate of  85%  in
secondary schools. No other country in Africa has that.  European  countries
with a much higher level of development don't have  that.  The  majority  of
our kids in school are females, both in primary and secondary  schools.  The
majority of our students in higher education  are  women  in  South  Africa.
This  is  all  as  a  result  of  what  you  dismissively  talked  about  as
transformation as a kind of swear word, he says. Affirmative action that  is
even worse, much worse. Don't tell me, Mr Raju, that you lifted yourself  up
by your bootstraps, because we know all our backgrounds involved in this.

Therefore, don't dismiss things like the renewal  of  our  society.  I  must
tell you that the renewal of our society is a permanent  thing.  There  will
come a time when affirmative action will end, rightly.  There  will  come  a
time when there will be transformation, which is a process, but the  renewal
of our education system is a permanent task, constantly trying to  find  out
what the real state of the education system is and what it should be like.

I end by wishing you well. Let me tell you about the thousands  of  teachers
who practice letsema. Maybe they have never  heard  of  letsema.  There  are
thousands of teachers who work in  the  afternoon.  At  the  same  time,  we
recognise that the whole tradition of voluntary work  needs  addressing  all
the time. There are thousands of teachers who have not heard about  letsema.
They don't even think they are doing voluntary  work.  They  don't  consider
being paid extra money for doing additional work on Saturdays. I am  talking
about black and white teachers here.  I  don't  mean  church  schools  only.
There are state schools too.

We greet these heroes and heroines, because we are talking about: Do you  do
anything extra because you have to be paid for  it?  I  will  tell  you  one
thing, if the spirit is not there, the motivation is not there, and all  our
teachers will play like the Springbok rugby team in  Australia.  [Laughter.]
We have to recognise that money is not the only catalyst,  that  it  is  not
the only impetus that makes people do things. The honourable  people  do  do
things - like social workers, like nurses. What we  now  need  to  bring  to
bear in a country that went through enormous low standards  under  apartheid
is renewal - and please, real low standards, and if you want to  talk  about
one country, just go and look at the situation we found in  the  examination
results in the homelands, in the townships; they were cooked-up  results.  I
remember when I came back in 1990, someone in the former House of  Delegates
said  that  the  Indian  results  were  very  poor;  there  were   too   few
distinctions. The next year, the distinctions went up by about 25%. That  is
the corruption we left behind. [Interjections.]

That is why the noble tasks of  deracialisation  and  renewal  and  ensuring
that there is parity of esteem for all of our teachers  are  really  genuine
values that we should aspire to. I regret to  say  that,  having  read  your
document on ``Education for liberation'', it is not only a pie in  the  sky,
it is really a rich man's value system for education.

I wish you well. I hope I will have another opportunity to meet you in  some
other place. Incidentally, I will certainly be seeing  the  hon  Chairperson
in another place next year. I wish you well. Thank you  very  much  for  the
debate, and your  particular  intense  interests  in  education.  Siyabonga.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: That concludes the debate. I shall now put  the
question. The question is that the Bill be agreed to. The decision is  dealt
with in terms of section 65 of the  Constitution.  I  note  that  delegation
heads are present in the Chamber to cast the votes of  their  provinces.  In
accordance with rule 71 I shall allow provinces to make  their  declarations
of vote, if they wish to do so. Is there any province who  wish  to  make  a
declaration of vote? There is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against  or  abstain  from  voting.

                       HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr D M KGWARE: Chair and hon members, in his foreword to the  National  Plan
for Higher Education in February 2001 the  Minister  of  Education,  Comrade
Kader Asmal, noted that the  institutional  landscape  of  higher  education
bears little relation to the needs of South  Africa  in  the  21st  century.
Certain areas of the country are poorly served by existing higher  education
institutions, and this places a significant limitation on access  to  higher
education for some sectors of the population. Central to  this  concern  and
integral  to  the  development  of  higher  education  is  the  absence   of
institutions of higher learning in  my  province,  the  Northern  Cape,  and
Mpumalanga.

Furthermore,  the  Minister  and,  by  extension,  the  department  and  the
directorate  of  higher  education  were   of   the   view   that   regional
collaboration  between  institutions  could  play  an  important   role   in
addressing claims for  higher  education  in  the  two  provinces  currently
without higher education institutions. Also, it was  felt  that,  given  the
overall situation of higher education in South Africa,  there  was  no  need
for  the  establishment  of  new  and  autonomous  institutions   in   these
provinces, hence the need for the establishment of  the  National  Institute
for Higher Education in Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape, which would  serve
as the administrative and governance hub to  ensure  coherent  provision  of
higher education programmes. In  this  regard,  the  emphasis  would  be  on
coherent provisioning of higher education programmes,  given  that  existing
programmes are uncoordinated and  characterised  by  unhealthy  competition,
including overlapping and duplication, and often with  little  relevance  to
provincial needs.

The primary aim of the National Institute for Higher Education  will  be  to
provide access to higher education programmes within  these  two  provinces.
Given that it will not be an autonomous  institution,  it  will  not  be  in
position to award degrees and diplomas. The central  task  of  the  national
institute will be  to  facilitate  the  provision  of  high  quality  higher
education programmes that are responsive to the socioeconomic needs  of  the
respective provinces.

As we all know, provinces have no direct legislative or executive powers  as
far as higher education is concerned, but they do have a vital  interest  in
the whole  system  of  education,  the  general  advancement  of  the  human
resources and the economy of the provinces. In the case  of  Mpumalanga  and
the Northern Cape, as in all provinces, authorities are concerned  with  the
promotion and support of higher education and have been strongly  supportive
of the initiative to establish the National Institute of  Higher  Education.
The national institute, which will have the responsibility of  co-ordinating
higher  education  activities  in  the  provinces  and  ensuring  that   the
educational programmes offered are responsive to local needs, will  have  to
build a special relationship with provincial authorities.

An important task of the National Institute of  Higher  Education  of  these
provinces was to conduct studies of the education and training needs of  the
respective provinces and their adjacent  areas.  Wide  consultation  between
the potential employers and surveys of  school-leavers  and  adult  learners
will be an ongoing process. Furthermore,  it  will  seek  to  exploit  local
opportunities and build on its capacity to offer educational  programmes.  A
further important task for the National Institute for  Higher  Education  is
to expand access to higher education as widely as possible.

It is against this background that the Higher Education  Amendment  Bill  is
introduced in this House today. It has the  support  of  Cabinet  which  has
given  it  the  green  light.  The  new  clauses  also   provide   for   the
establishment of a board to manage,  govern  and  administer  each  National
Institute for Higher Education and for the funding of a  National  Institute
for Higher Education. In addition,  the  Bill  also  seeks  to  provide  for
further regular reporting by the Council on Higher Education  on  the  state
of higher education, regarding developments in higher  education,  including
an annual report on the state of higher education on a regular basis.

In conclusion, we believe that the Higher Education  Amendment  Bill  is  in
line with our Government's human resources development  strategy,  and  will
in no small way add a much - needed impetus to its  objectives.  We  support
this amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   75   of   the
Constitution.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT MONITORING COMMITTEE ON QUALITY OF LIFE
  AND STATUS OF WOMEN - PROVINCIAL STUDY TOURS TO MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION OF
                  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACT AND MAINTENANCE ACT

Ms M P THEMBA: Madam Chairperson, thank  you.  Please  allow  me,  before  I
continue with my speech, to  briefly  explain  the  meaning  of  this  white
ribbon. I heard some men asking, when the ribbons  were  pinned  onto  their
jackets, what these were for. I'll pin their names outside the door when  we
go out.

This means that we are all in solidarity with women  and  children  who  are
being abused, as today is the launching of the 16 Days  of  Activism  of  No
Violence Against Women and Children. We must not forget  the  ribbons,  even
tomorrow, until 10 December. We must wear them.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of  Quality  of  Life  and
Status of Women undertook study tours to all  provinces  during  April  2000
and May 2003. The objectives  of  this  report  state  that  the  monitoring
committee felt it's important that we don't just sit here in Parliament  and
do not oversee the implementation of the Act that has been put in  place  in
order to improve the quality of lives and the status of women.

However, allow me to state that, as part of  our  oversight  and  monitoring
function,  the  most  fundamental  question  is  whether  these  pieces   of
legislation,  together  with  the  gender  machineries  in  provinces,  have
improved the status and quality of lives of women. If so, then how,  and  if
not, then why not, and how can we  really  improve  this  situation,  should
this be necessary?

These Acts have been a relative success and I would like to mention some  of
those successes. Let me just state at  the  outset  that  one  of  the  main
objectives  of  our  visits  was  also  to  identify   problems   with   the
implementation of the Acts, and that the report  leans  towards  identifying
the problems and, I can say, limiting the successes.

This should not be seen as some  sort  of  admission  that  these  Acts  are
failing in improving the quality of the lives of women. It should rather  be
seen as our Government taking a realistic look at our delivery  and  of  our
undertaking to ensure a better life for South Africans. We do not  shy  away
from admitting where things can be improved, but sometimes we, as  the  ANC,
are too shy to claim our successes.

I would like to dwell on  some  of  those  successes.  With  regard  to  the
Domestic Violence Act, there is an acknowledgement  in  the  provinces  that
the enactment of this Act has led to  great  improvements.  Members  of  the
public are aware of the provisions of the Act and their possible  causes  of
action when domestic problems are experienced.

In some provinces specialised courts have  been  established  to  deal  with
issues affecting women and children, and some provinces have  reported  that
a  more  effective  service  is  being  delivered  where  there  are   these
specialised prosecutors and courts.

Furthermore, public awareness and  education  campaigns  are  held  by,  for
example,  the  SA   Police   Services,   prosecutors   and   nongovernmental
organisations, and there is a higher level of community  involvement  within
the delivery of services at courts and police stations.

The Maintenance Act is viewed  as  constructive  and  progressive,  as  it's
designed to facilitate the  payment  of  maintenance.  The  Justice  College
provides regular training and workshops  for,  amongst  others,  maintenance
officers, clerks and prosecutors, and close co-operation exists between  the
courts and NGOs in some areas in the  provinces.  The  Maintenance  Act  has
established effective ways of dealing with the issue of nonpayment, and  the
success rate of specialised maintenance  courts  and  prosecutors  has  been
good.
The offices of the status of women monitor provincial departments  in  terms
of gender mainstreaming in programmes, budgets, projects, etc, and there  is
regular collaboration with NGOs in this regard. One of their main  successes
has been the initiation of projects on poverty  alleviation  and  employment
creation.

Some  provinces  have  developed  gender   policy   frameworks,   and   most
departments in provinces have developed  gender  focal  points,  though  not
formally appointed, and  they  still  need  to  be  strengthened.  We  have,
therefore, succeeded in moving gender  issues  from  being  an  addendum  to
other issues to being at  the  very  heart  of  the  transformation  process
within all structures, institutions, procedures,  practices  and  programmes
of our Government, its agencies  and  parastatals,  civil  society  and  the
private sector.

As we say in the ANC, we always have and always will  continue  to  campaign
for a culture of recognition of women's rights as human rights. I must  also
say that we have succeeded to a significant extent.

However, let us not forget that not all is well with the  implementation  of
these  Acts,  and  that  the  operation  of  the  gender  machinery  can  be
significantly improved. It is particularly disheartening to admit that  many
of  the  problems  encountered  with  the  implementation  of  the  Domestic
Violence Act relate to the role that members of the SA Police  Services  and
court staff play in processing these cases.  We  encountered  reports  that,
for example, police officials are insensitive  to  the  plight  of  men  who
report abuse and that they do not acknowledge same-sex partnerships.

Equally alarming were the  reports  that  domestic  violence  is  still  not
regarded as part of police officials' workload, but rather as an  additional
activity, which is a burden and a family matter. This reminds one, a  little
too close for  comfort,  of  the  attitudes  encountered  under  the  former
regime.  These  attitudes  are  out   of   place   in   our   constitutional
dispensation. We fought too hard to secure these rights for  our  people  to
allow this situation to continue.

A few of the other difficulties encountered with the Domestic  Violence  Act
also relate to the Maintenance Act. Language was  stated  to  be  a  barrier
under both Acts, and there is a serious lack of equipment and  resources  in
order to process complaints in terms of the Acts.

Rural women, in particular, reported that whilst they may be  aware  of  the
existence of these Acts, they find it difficult to understand  their  rights
in terms of the Acts  and,  therefore,  find  enforcement  of  their  rights
virtually impossible.

Certain challenges relate only to the Maintenance Act,  for  example,  where
maintenance inspectors have not been appointed and women themselves have  to
look for the absconding maintenance defaulters.  Maintenance  processes  are
long and drawn out, and this often results in respondents who have  contract
employment being out of work at the time the case is heard. This  is,  quite
obviously, not in the best interests of anyone.

There are  other  issues,  such  as  maintenance  fraud,  maintenance  files
disappearing and,  of  course,  the  immense  workload  experienced  by  our
courts. All these challenges combine to make  the  implementation  of  these
Acts neither as easy nor as effective as it should be.

It serves no one to only list problems and not suggest solutions.  The  most
obvious solution is, of course, training -  training  for  the  Police,  the
medical staff, the courts staff, the volunteers and, most  importantly,  for
the complainants. We need to educate our people about their  rights.  It  is
not enough to only tell them that they have these rights. We need to  inform
our  people  about  how  they  can  exercise  their  rights  and  about  the
institutions this ANC-led Government has put in place  to  help  our  people
exercise their rights.

We need to increase our  social  spending  and,  luckily,  the  Minister  of
Finance seems to have realised this. We need to spend  more  money  to  help
the Police, social  workers,  courts  and  health  facilities  recruit  more
staff, train their staff and acquire the necessary resources.

Other solutions seem more practical. Let us  provide  application  forms  in
languages that people understand, and let us also make these  forms  simpler
and shorter. We do not want to burden already traumatised people  by  asking
them to wade through complicated documents to access their  constitutionally
guaranteed rights.

The abuse of protection orders was reported ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson, on a point of order: I  would  like  to  know
whether we have a quorum in the House?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mrs Versfeld,  this  is  a  provincial
matter that we are discussing, and I am convinced that the delegation  heads
are all present here. You yourself are representing the Western Cape, and  I
can see the hon Adams there from the Northern Cape, the North West is  here,
Mpumalanga is here, Limpopo is here,  KwaZulu-Natal,  Gauteng,  Free  State.
Everybody is here.

Mr F ADAMS: Agb Voorsitter, hoewel ek nie persoonlik ...  [Hon  Chairperson,
although I personally was not ...]

Dr E A CONROY: Madam Chairperson, I'm just wondering whether the hon  member
knows that she's the only member of the DA  in  the  House  at  the  moment.
[Interjections.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: [Inaudible.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Versfeld, we are in  the  House,  and  we
are conducting the business of the day. If you wish to  talk  to  a  member,
talk through me. Don't respond to a member directly. Can  you  do  that  for
me? Thank you very much.

Mnr F ADAMS: Agb Voorsitter, hoewel ek nie persoonlik deel van die toer  was
nie, bring  ek  graag  hulde  aan  daardie  belanghebbendes  wat  belangrike
veranderings aan vroueregte in  die  provinsies  en  in  Suid-Afrika  teweeg
gebring het. Ek het deur die dokumente gewerk  en  besef  dat  opleiding  'n
baie belangrike kwessie is vir die inwerkingstelling van die  wetgewing  oor
huishoudelike geweld. Meer fokus moet geplaas word op die  inwerkingstelling
van die wetgewing oor huishoudelike geweld.

Die   beskermingsopdragte   word   misbruik.    Die    aansoeke    is    nie
verbruikersvriendelik genoeg nie. Tolke en taal  is  'n  groot  probleem  in
howe. Die balju-tariewe moet ook aangespreek word. Daar is 'n  groot  gebrek
aan begrip van die wetgewing oor huishoudelike geweld, sowel  as  'n  gebrek
aan ondersteuningsdienste en hulpbronne.

Daar is ook 'n gebrek aan behoorlike gesondheidsdienste en  afwesigheid  van
maatskaplike   werkers,   wat   bydra   tot   oorlading.   Daar   is    meer
gespesialiseerde  personeel  nodig   by   polisiestasies,   byvoorbeeld   om
forensiese bewyse te hanteer.

Werkloosheid en seisoenale werk is hoofredes  waarom  onderhoud  nie  betaal
word nie. Daar is ook te min  onderhoudbeamptes  en  tolke,  en  respondente
lieg oor hulle finansiële posisie.  Hierdie  wetgewing  het  meer  werk  vir
landdroste en aanklaers geskep, wat wyer uitkring en bydra tot die  tyd  wat
dit neem om onderhoudsake af te handel.

Daar is 'n groot gebrek aan inligting en opvoeding, sowel as begrip van  die
wet self. Daar is ook 'n swak administratiewe stelsel by die hof.

Ek stem saam met die aanbeveling van punt 6 in die verslag. Ek is veral  bly
oor   die   verhoogde    begroting,    deurlopende    opleiding    en    die
moniteringstelsel.  Ek  is   bly   om   te   sien   dat   die   aansoekvorms
verbruikersvriendelik is en dat die taalhindernis aangespreek sal word.

Opvoeding  moet  'n   prioriteit   word,   en   daar   moet   'n   nasionale
bewusmakingsveldtog wees sodat ons die publiek op  voetsoolvlak  kan  opvoed
en inlig, want dit is waar hierdie kwessies werklik van belang is.

Ek is bly dat nie-regeringsorganisasies finansiering  sal  ontvang  vir  die
opvoeding en opleiding van die gemeenskap, want wat ons  wil  sien,  is  dat
vroue met die sensitiwiteit behandel word wat  hulle  verdien.  Ek  dank  u.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs  follows.)


[Mr F ADAMS: Hon Chairman, although I personally was not part of  the  tour,
I would like to  pay  tribute  to  those  interested  parties  who  effected
important changes to women's rights in the provinces and in South Africa.  I
studied the documents and realised that training is a very important  aspect
for the implementation  of  the  legislation  on  domestic  violence.  There
should be a sharper focus  on  the  implementation  of  the  legislation  on
domestic violence.

The protection clauses are being abused.  The  applications  are  not  user-
friendly enough. Interpreters and language are  a  big  problem  in  courts.
Sheriff tariffs  should  also  be  addressed.  There  is  a  great  lack  of
understanding of the legislation on domestic violence, as well as a lack  of
support services and resources.

There is also a lack of proper health services  and  an  absence  of  social
workers, which contributes to overload. More specialised  staff  are  needed
at police stations, for example to deal with forensic evidence.

Unemployment and seasonal work are the main reasons why maintenance  is  not
paid. There are also too few maintenance  officials  and  interpreters,  and
respondents  lie  about  their  financial  position.  This  legislation  has
created more work for magistrates and prosecutors, which  is  expanding  and
is contributing to the time it takes to finalise maintenance cases.

There  is  a  great  lack  of  information  and  education,   as   well   as
understanding  of  the  legislation   itself.   There   is   also   a   poor
administrative system in the courts.

I agree with the recommendation of point 6 in the report.  I  am  especially
glad about the increased budget, the ongoing  training  and  the  monitoring
system. I am pleased to see that the  application  forms  are  user-friendly
and that the language obstacle will be addressed.

Education  should  become  a  priority,  and  there  should  be  a  national
awareness campaign  so  that  we  can  educate  and  inform  the  public  at
grassroots  level,  because  that  is  where  these  issues  are   of   real
importance.

I am glad that  NGOs  will  be  receiving  funding  for  the  education  and
training of the community, because what we would like to see is  that  women
are  dealt  with  with  the  sensitivity  they   deserve.   I   thank   you.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson and colleagues, I would like  to  commend  the
Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status  of
Women  for  undertaking  provincial  visits  to  study   and   monitor   the
implementation of the Domestic Violence Act and the Maintenance Act, Act  99
of 1998 during September 2003.

This has highlighted many problems that affect women  and  children  in  the
society we live in. Our womenfolk are often  too  shy  and  afraid  to  talk
about these problems, especially when they occur in,  and  directly  involve
the immediate  family  sector.  Such  visits  by  this  committee  encourage
victims to break out of their silence and expose the abusers.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status
of Women has an important role in representing the public and in  exercising
an oversight role.

Umsebenzi osuwenziwe yileli komidi elibhekela ukungaxhashazwa  kwabesifazane
futhi  elibhekela  ukuthi  isithunzi  namalungelo  abo  afane  nawebesilisa,
uyancomeka kakhulu.

Namhlanje siqala umbhidlango wokugcina  lo  Mthetho  owashaywa  yiPhalamende
ukubheka  lolu  dlame  olwenzeka  emndenini.  Lo  mbhidlango   uyoze   ufike
enyangeni kaZibandlela mhla ziyi-16.

Leli  komidi  livakashele  izifundazwe  eziningi,  lihlanganisa  umphakathi,
lizama ukuhlola isimo  ezindaweni  eziningi.  Iziphathimandla  kwezomthetho,
kuwo onke  amazinga,  bezibakhona  kule  mihlangano.  Siyethemba  ukuthi  le
mihlangano ebibanjwa ibasizile abaningi ebebekhona, ekubuzeni imibuzo  ukuze
bakhanyiselwe ukuthi izinkinga abanazo  zingaxazululwa  kanjani.  Siyethemba
ukuthi,  mayelana  nomsebenzi  omuhle  oqalwe   yileli   komidi   elibhekela
amalungelo abesifazane, lizoqhubeka nomsebenzi walo omuhle.

Thina be-IFP siyawahlonipha kakhulu amalungelo  abesifazane,  ngakho  sithi,
kuleli komidi  elikhulu,  ``Phambili  nomsebenzi  wenu  omuhle!  Phambili!''
Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The work of this committee,  which  deals  with  the  abuse  of  women  and
affords  them  the  dignity  and  rights  equal  to  those  of  their   male
counterparts, is highly commendable.

Today we  begin  the  campaign  to  fulfil  the  law  that  was  enacted  by
Parliament to deal with family violence. This campaign  will  continue  into
the month of December and finish on the 16th.

The committee visited many provinces  and  brought  members  of  the  public
together for the purpose of determining the prevailing situation in  various
places. Legal authorities at different levels attended  these  meetings.  We
hope that these meetings were useful to most  of  the  people  who  attended
them by affording the people the opportunity to ask  questions  and  receive
explanations on how to solve their problems. We  hope  that  this  committee
which provides for women's rights will continue with the good work.

We of the IFP respect women's rights, so to this  great  committee  we  say:
Forward with the good work, forward! Thank you. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, hon Vilakazi. It's  very
nice to see hon Versfeld and Mr Adams now talking.

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Madam Chairperson, hon members, the committee  undertook
a number of study tours between April 2000 and May 2003 ...  [Interjections]
... to all provinces,  especially  to  investigate  the  implementation  and
monitoring of the Domestic Violence Act and the Maintenance  Act  but,  more
generally, to assess and report on whether women enjoy the full  measure  of
their human rights, as outlined in the Constitution.  As  one  can  imagine,
such a brief held immense implications for our country's  women  in  general
and our nation as a whole.

These implications are  especially  notable  when  one  considers  that  our
history has been marked by extremes when it comes to the  issues  of  women.
If one looks at the violation of basic human rights that occurred until  the
first  democratic  election,  then  one  realises  that  the  struggle  was,
essentially, a public struggle  to  find  liberation  and  freedom  from  an
oppressive regime. During this period,  large  numbers  of  women  paid  the
ultimate price for this freedom which we enjoy today.

However, since liberation, the struggle for the rights of women  has  become
more intimate and located within the privacy of the home or workplace.  This
struggle for the liberation of women  from  the  shackles  of  violence  and
abuse has transcended  race,  class  and  religious  lines,  and  has  drawn
together women who face a common enemy. This enemy is  the  abusive  spouse,
partner, lover, brother, uncle, father or grandfather; and, on the  outside,
the stranger, the policeman, the robber or thief - all  of  whom  feel  they
have an inalienable right to violate a woman in order to force her  to  bend
to their will.

Additionally, women have had to bear  the  burden  of  raising  families  on
their own. A large number of irresponsible  men  have  thought  that  it  is
normal to participate in the creation of children and  then  abdicate  their
responsibilities when it comes to  raising  their  children.  This  kind  of
abuse of women's and children's rights, again, transcends race,  colour  and
creed and plunges families into abject poverty.

Our ANC-led  Government  recognised  that  the  often  brutal  violation  of
women's and children's rights was widespread throughout the entire  country,
and brought about these two pieces of legislation -  the  Domestic  Violence
Act and Maintenance Act - to deal directly with and overcome the problem.

What this report indicates is that the measures taken, with  regard  to  the
Domestic Violence Act, have shown improvement in the  treatment  of  women's
rights. The justice  system,  through  prosecutors,  has  shown  that  great
strides have been  made  to  alleviate  the  burden  that  women  previously
carried by themselves. The  Police  Service  have  increasingly  prioritised
issues of women and children, and often liaise  with  magistrates  to  bring
about constructive changes to intolerable situations. Even NGOs have  played
a more active role in  highlighting  problems  in  communities  and  in  co-
operating with the relevant Government services.
Of course, there have been some problems and  these  have  been  where  some
Police Service officials have not embraced  prioritising  domestic  violence
to its fullest extent, and  victims  are  then  subjected  to  a  number  of
additional abuses while waiting for the mechanics  of  the  system  to  fall
into place, such  as  language  barriers,  sloppy  evidence  collection  and
overburdening of police officers.

Regarding the Maintenance Act, some of the primary concerns  have  been  the
absconding and nonarrest of defaulters, in addition to a  huge  burden  that
is placed on an already overburdened staff component.

The JMC has been increasingly concerned that the  gender  machinery  in  the
provinces has been  unable  to  influence  policy  decisions,  or  has  been
excluded from decision-making powers, such as gender focal  points  and  the
Office on the Status of Women. These vital watchdog bodies which  prioritise
the  issues  of  women  have  found  themselves  with  inadequate  budgetary
allocations and with poor or fragmented relationships between  the  national
and provincial offices.
This report shows that despite the legislative  framework  we  have  put  in
place to protect the rights of women, we still have a  long  way  to  go  to
ensure its efficient implementation.  Needless  to  say,  we  also  need  to
ensure that gender issues and the rights of women are incorporated into  all
aspects of provincial and national affairs. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate.  I  am  sure  that
those who disturbed the hon Mashangoane did not disturb her in the way  that
Ms Gouws would have done, if she had been here.

I shall now put the question. The question is that the Report be agreed  to.
As the decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I
shall first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are  present  in  the
Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. Are all delegation heads present?

In accordance with rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. We  shall  now  proceed
to the voting on the question. I shall do  so  in  alphabetical  order,  per
province. Delegation heads must please indicate to the  Chair  whether  they
vote in favour or against or abstain  from  voting.  EMpumakoloni?  [Eastern

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
    AFFAIRS - MONTREAL AND BEIJING AMENDMENTS TO THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL ON
                   SUBSTANCES THAT DEPLETE THE OZONE LAYER

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I'm not very sure of my voice, but I think  I'll
endeavour. Hon  Chairperson,  hon  members,  South  Africa  acceded  to  the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer on  15  January
1990 in an endeavour to be in line with other states as far as  adhering  to
environmental principles worldwide is concerned.

The said protocol is designed to protect the ozone  layer  from  the  damage
done by human-made chemicals that are  released  into  the  atmosphere.  The
ozone layer absorbs the UV-B rays from the sun and thus protects  human  and
other life forms on earth from the damaging effects of these rays.

The amendments before us today signify in a very profound  manner  that  our
country, as a signatory to the Montreal Protocol,  has  to  honour  all  the
obligations and principles of being a  party  to  it,  to  comply  with  the
spirit and letter of the protocol, and also to benefit from all  dues  South
Africa is entitled to as a party to the protocol.

In 1997 control measures were taken to further regulate the  consumption  of
methyl bromide. Methyl bromide is a multipurpose  pesticide  which  is  used
mainly in our country in the  production  of  tomatoes,  and  is  controlled
under the  fertiliser  Acts  in  South  Africa.  It  can  only  be  used  by
registered applicants. South Africa only imports methyl bromide  and,  owing
to the fact that mandatory licensing  systems  to  control  the  import  and
export of  ozone-depleting  substances  have  also  been  introduced,  these
decisions, therefore, led  to  the  Montreal  amendment.  Cognisance  should
further be taken of the fact that methyl  bromide  forms  the  base  of  the
production and packaging of all juices. That is how important it is.

In 1999 the Beijing amendment to the protocol was made, which  provided  for
new controls of the production of hydro chlorofluorocarbons, HCFCs.  We  are
the highest consumer of HCFCs in Africa. South  Africa  consumes  more  than
40 000  tons  of  HCFCs  annually.  These  substances  are  used  mainly  in
refrigeration, air conditioning, foam blowing, aerosols,  mining,  solvents,
etc. As chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs, are  being  phased  out,  our  industrial
sector depends on and has invested heavily in HCFCs for its survival.  There
would therefore be gross adverse effects if South Africa were denied use  of
these substances.

It should be borne in mind that the Montreal Protocol, to  which  we  are  a
signatory, dictates that parties that have not ratified  both  the  Montreal
and Beijing amendments, are to be regarded as nonparties as  far  as  methyl
bromide  and  HCFCs  are  concerned.  We  should  therefore  understand  the
importance of both methyl bromide and HCFCs in and for our country.

In  adhering  to  our  responsibilities  as  a  signatory  to  the  Montreal
Protocol,  South  Africa  is  phasing  out  the  following   ozone-depleting
substances: chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs; halons; methyl chloroform and  carbon
tetrachloride.

Besides there being more emphasis on the importance  of  ratifying  the  two
amendments, there are measures afoot and  development  is  taking  place  in
South Africa on alternatives, especially  regarding  methyl  bromide.  I  am
also of the  opinion  that  legal  and  management  arrangements  should  be
instituted that will enable our country to meet its obligations in time,  as
established in terms of the relevant conventions and protocols.

In conclusion, the Beijing and Montreal amendments to the Montreal  Protocol
are very important for our country as one of  the  original  signatories  to
the Montreal Protocol in  1990.  I  therefore  move  that  we  support  this
protocol. I thank you. [Applause.]

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - ACCESSION TO THE
 PROTOCOL OF AMENDMENT TO THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON THE SIMPLIFICATION
                   AND HARMONISATION OF CUSTOMS PROCEDURES

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I now call upon Rev ... Oh,  sorry,  Dr  E  A
Conroy.

Dr E A CONROY: Thank you for the new  title,  Chairperson.  [Laughter.]  Hon
Chairperson  and   colleagues,   the   International   Convention   on   the
Simplification and Harmonisation  of  Customs  Procedures  -  or  the  Kyoto
Convention, as it is normally referred to - was opened for signature  on  18
May 1973 and entered into force on 25 September 1974.

South Africa acceded to the Kyoto Convention on 19 May  1981  and,  although
having noted reservations against several  of  the  annexures,  is  a  state
party to the convention. The  Council  of  the  World  Customs  Organisation
accepted the protocol of  amendment  to  the  Kyoto  Convention  during  its
session on 26 June  1999,  and  the  protocol  of  amendment  was  open  for
signature until 30 June 2000.

The  World  Customs  Organisation  is  an   intergovernmental   organisation
representing 162 customs administrations. Its mission  is  to  simplify  and
facilitate international trade  by  standardising  and  harmonising  customs
formalities and procedures. The WCO executes its mission by,  amongst  other
things, establishing  and  maintaining  international  instruments  for  the
harmonisation and uniform application of simplified  and  effective  customs
systems and procedures.

Since the entry into force of the convention in 1974, the  rapid  growth  in
international trade and developments in the information  and  communications
technology, as well as the international business environment,  necessitated
a review of the convention. This review resulted  in  the  adoption  of  the
protocol of amendment to the International Convention on the  Simplification
and Harmonisation of Customs Procedures,  or  the  so-called  revised  Kyoto
Convention, in 1999.

The protocol of amendment consists of  a  main  body  and  three  appendixes
which, in turn, contain the main body of the revised Kyoto  Convention  with
a general  annex  and  various  specific  annexes,  standards,  transitional
standards and  recommended  practices.  The  protocol  of  amendment  allows
contracting parties, after acceding to the general  annex,  three  years  to
implement the standards,  and  five  years  to  implement  the  transitional
standards. The protocol also requires  contracting  parties  to  accept  the
general annex.

The main objective  of  the  protocol  of  amendment  to  the  International
Convention on the Simplification and Harmonisation of Customs Procedures  is
to facilitate  legitimate  trade  by  simplifying  and  harmonising  customs
procedures and practices. The revised Kyoto Convention  is  widely  regarded
as the blueprint for modern  and  efficient  customs  procedures,  and  will
contribute to the predictability and efficiency  required  in  international
trade.

South Africa wishes to accept the  amendments  to  the  convention  and  the
general annex to the protocol of amendment, and can accept it by lodging  an
instrument of accession with the depository  of  the  protocol,  namely  the
Secretary-General of  the  Customs  Co-operation  Council.  Any  legislative
measures that may be taken in terms of the Kyoto Convention,  including  the
general annex, will be made subject to the domestic laws of the  contracting
parties. The Chief State Law Adviser has indicated that  the  provisions  of
the Kyoto Convention would appear not to be in conflict with  South  African
domestic law.
The Select Committee on Finance, having considered the request for  approval
by Parliament of the accession to the protocol, recommends that  the  House,
in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approve the accession. I  so
move. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I shall  now  put  the  question.  The
question is that the report be agreed to. As the decision is dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I  shall  first  ascertain  whether

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - ACCESSION TO THE
           CONVENTION ON TEMPORARY ADMISSION: ISTANBUL CONVENTION

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson  and  colleagues,  the  past  50  years  have
witnessed the proliferation of conventions, agreements  and  recommendations
aimed at facilitating the temporary staying abroad of  goods  and  means  of
transport.  These  instruments  were  developed  as  a  result  of  strongly
expanding international trade and increasing  international  interaction  in
the pursuance of professional, scientific, cultural and social objectives.

South Africa is a contracting party  to  seven  World  Customs  Organisation
conventions that  deal  with  the  temporary  admission  of,  amongst  other
things, scientific equipment, pedagogic material,  and  packings  and  goods
for use at fairs. Each of these treaties provides  for  its  own  conditions
governing the temporary admission of the goods covered by them.

This  situation,  however,  created  difficulties  for  the  users  of   the
instruments and the customs administrations which  were  tasked  with  their
application. As a result, the WCO was requested to develop  a  comprehensive
international instrument dealing with the temporary admission of  goods  and
means of transport.

The Istanbul Convention establishes  a  consolidated  regime  governing  the
temporary admission of goods and means  of  transport,  and  terminates  and
replaces existing instruments dealing exclusively or mainly  with  temporary
admission.

The convention on temporary admission was adopted by the Council of the  WCO
on 26 June 1990 in Istanbul, Turkey, and entered into force on  27  November
1993. The Istanbul Convention is one of the  main  international  agreements
of the WCO aimed at the harmonising and simplifying of customs procedures.

The convention consists of 34 articles and 13 annexes. While the  main  body
of the convention contains the basic principles  underlying  the  convention
and provisions necessary for uniform implementation, the 34 articles of  the
main body are contained in five chapters dealing  with  various  aspects  of
the convention.
As already indicated, the  Istanbul  Convention  simplifies  and  harmonises
customs formalities in connection with temporary  admission  and,  as  such,
greatly contributes  to  the  promotion  and  development  of  international
trade. It also gathers all existing temporary admission facilities  under  a
single instrument  and  provides  a  framework  for  dealing  with  any  new
categories of goods requiring temporary admission facilities.

The office of the Chief State Law Adviser  has  scrutinised  the  convention
and  its  annexes  and  found  the  agreement  to  be  in  compliance   with
international law practice.  The  agreement  falls  within  the  purview  of
section 231(2) of the Constitution and is thus binding on  the  Republic  of
South Africa upon approval by Parliament.

The Select Committee on Finance, having considered the request for  approval
referred to it, recommends to and requests this House to  approve  accession
to the Convention on the Temporary  Admission:  Istanbul  Convention.  I  so
move. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Labour  and  Public  Enterprises  on
     Oversight Visit to Limpopo, dated 12 November 2003:


     The Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises,  having  visited
     Limpopo Province on 22 August 2003, reports as follows:


     A.     TERMS OF REFERENCE


         In  order  to  encourage  the  clustering  of  activities   amongst
         committees of the NCOP,  the  Select  Committees  on  Economic  and
         Foreign Affairs and on Labour and Public  Enterprises  undertook  a
         joint visit to  Polokwane  Province.  This  report  captures  those
         issues which are relevant to the Select  Committee  on  Labour  and
         Public Enterprises (the Committee).


         The aim of the visit was to assess  the  challenges  faced  by  the
         Province  within  the  telecommunications   and   postal   services
         sectors.


     B.     LOGISTICAL ARRANGEMENTS


         The delegation consisted of the following persons:


         Mrs C Nkuna (Chairperson)
         Mr J B Tolo
         Mr L G Lever
         Mr R Z Nogumla
         Mr N M Raju
         Mrs D M Ramodibe
         Ms P Mpoyiya (Committee Secretary)
         Mr E Kgopa (Committee Secretary).


         The Department of Communications  (the  Department)  assisted  with
         arranging the briefings, the site visit and  the  drafting  of  the
         programme for the week (refer to Annexure A).
     C.     FINDINGS


         1.  Briefing  by  Unit  Manager,  Postal  Services:  Department  of
              Communications and visit to Public Internet Terminal (PIT)  in
              Polokwane


              Mr Makoni Masemola, Area Manager of the Post Office,  welcomed
              the Committee and briefly identified the services  offered  by
              the Post Office. In response to the  aim  of  the  Committee's
              visit, Mrs  B  Motapanyane,  Unit  Manager:  Postal  Services,
              Department of  Communications,  made  a  presentation  to  the
              Committee.


              A brief overview of the project/objectives


              *   The PIT is part of the Department's futuristic information
                strategy. The Com 2005 cluster of national  projects  within
                the Information Communications Technology (ICT)  arena  will
                be implemented over the coming years as the  foundation  for
                both the information society and the information economy.


              *   PIT is a joint project  between  the  Department  and  the
                South African Post Offices Limited (SAPO).


              *    The  objective  of  PIT  is  to  create  a  communication
                structure through which the public will also be empowered to
                have electronic access to information and communication  via
                electronic mail.


              *   There are six basic  categories  of  services  offered  by
                PITs, which include government information, e-mail services,
                Internet browsing, business services,  educational  services
                and SMS transmission to a cellular telephone  or  an  e-mail
                address.
              Extension of postal services in Polokwane


              The postal services sector is  seen  as  a  critical  part  of
              information and communications infrastructure and services  to
              assist in bridging the digital divide through economic  growth
              and  improved  access  to  basic  communication  services.  To
              respond to this challenge the Department  has  introduced  the
              concept  of  Citizens  Post  Offices  (CPOs),   which   target
              communities serviced  by  rural  post  offices.  The  facility
              involves  a  bank  of  computers  with  e-mail  and   Internet
              connectivity, a photocopier, a printer, a scanner, a binder, a
              fax machine and public telephones.  In  Limpopo  Province  the
              Department has deployed a CPO at Elim Hospital in the  Makhado
              area. Attempts are being made  to  roll  out  another  CPO  at
              Sekhukhune Post Office in the Greater Sekhukhune Municipality.
              A multi-purpose community center (MPCC) is to be rolled out at
              the Ximungwe Post Office and Casteel  MPCC  in  the  Bohlabela
              Municipality. These will be completed by 31 March 2004.


              The trend in the use of the CPO at Elim Hospital CPO indicates
              that services such as photocopying, faxing  and  making  calls
              from a public telephone are more popular  than  computer-based
              services. The challenge, therefore, is to popularise computer-
              based  services  through  community  awareness  and   outreach
              programmes. In order to address  this  matter,  the  SMEs  are
              encouraged to  participate  in  owning  photocopiers  and  fax
              machines in order to generate business for themselves and  for
              women to become business partners.


              PIT sites


              There are PITs throughout the country. In Polokwane, PITs have
              been established in the following areas:


              *   Boyne, Main Road (next to Mori Head Quarters)


              *   Hoedspruit, Panther Street


              *   Bushbuckridge,/Jongilane, Stand 298, Arthurstone Farm


              *   Lebowakgomo, 13 Maudid Phasha Centre


              *   Mahwelereng, Shopping Complex Zone


              *   Pietersburg, Thabo Mbeki Street


              *   Thohoyhandou Shopping Centre


              *   Letsitele


              *   Namakgale Township


              *   Kgatswane MPCC


              Integration of services


              Government has adopted the concept of multi-purpose  community
              centres  to  advance  the  co-ordination  and  integration  of
              services   between   various   government   departments    and
              organisations. As part of  the  Department's  contribution  to
              this concept,  it  has  extended  the  citizen's  post  office
              concept to community post offices.  These  are  retail  postal
              agencies that are owned and managed by  community  structures,
              such    as    traditional    authorities,     non-governmental
              organisations and community-based organisations. They are more
              prevalent in Limpopo, Mpumalanga and the North-West  Provinces
              and are being integrated with other government services.


              Challenges in the postal services sector


              *   All post offices, MPCCs, municipal councils  and  shopping
                centres should have PITs.


              *    Not  all  post  offices   have   the   required   network
                infrastructure.


              *   All citizens should have an e-mail address.


              *   The design of PiTs should cater for the needs of a broader
                variety of citizens, for example people with disabilities.


              The Post Office has a network of approximately  3  600  postal
              outlets throughout the  country.  These  outlets  are  located
              within different communities with wide-ranging  socio-economic
              circumstances.  It  is,  therefore,  a   challenge   for   the
              Department to install a PIT at a post office that  is  located
              in  an  area  with  no  network  infrastructure,   since   the
              infrastructure is dependent  on  other  role  payers  such  as
              Telkom.


              The Department is looking at moving  beyond  the  Post  Office
              network. Attempts are being made to get other stakeholders  on
              board, such as schools, hospitals, clinics, etc.


              Successes in postal services sector


              *   In addition to the 100 sites that are operating throughout
                the country, 200 other sites are currently being rolled out.
                The focus in  relation  to  these  200  sites  has  been  on
                priority areas, such as nodal points, which have been placed
                in rural or urban areas as part  of  the  Universal  Service
                Agency (USA).
              *   200 sites for the year 2003-04  have  been  identified  in
                rural and urban areas by Universal Service Agency.


              *   The Department is considering the possibility of using the
                PIT website on other computers around the  world  to  access
                PIT  services.  One  can  also  access   the   PIT   website
                (www.pit.co.za) within the comfort  of  one's  own  home  on
                one's own desktop.


              *   The integration of PIT with e-government initiatives, such
                as gateway projects, has been achieved.


              Future plans


              *   A further roll out of 400 PITs by March 2004.
              *    Rollouts  will  focus  on  MPCCs,  post  offices,  health
                facilities, schools  (ABET),  municipal  councils,  shopping
                centres and SMMEs.
              *   PIT community pilot projects will be established in  order
                to capture and collate stories about communities  multimedia
                and which can be accessed from a PIT.


              *   MPCCs will in future be  connected  by  V-Sat  (satellite)
                because of the lack of the SAPO local area network.


              *    More  joint  projects   are   planned   with   government
                departments, such as the  Department  of  Health  on  health
                education and with the Department of  Agriculture  and  Land
                Affairs on the branding of animals.


              Assessment of the usage of PIT centres


              A national study was conducted on  the  use  of  PIT  centres.
              Findings  of  the  study  indicated  that  people   used   the
              facilities for different reasons,  such  compiling  a  CV,  e-
              business,  education,  e-mail,  and  government  and  internet
              searches. Out of these activities, e-mail was the most popular
              activity.


              Question-and-answer session


              What is the department doing to ensure that all  services  are
              centralised to provide a one-stop service?


              The MPCCs were meant to serve this  purpose,  but  departments
              chose to decentralise their services. However,  the  trend  is
              towards decentralising and integrating services within MPCCs.


              What  is  the  rationale  behind  the  establishment  PITs  in
              Polokwane, which has services, and not in rural areas?
              The statistics in the report given to  members  are  only  for
              post offices with connectivity i.e. PIT. The  Department  aims
              to target all areas, especially those with MPCCs.
              Statistics on use of PITs in Limpopo are too low when compared
              to the rest of the country.  Can this be viewed as  a  success
              for the Department?


              The  Department  uses  the  information  systems  to   capture
              information, thus it is possible through the PIT system to get
              this information.


              Does the government provide for services in MPCCs?


              MPCCs are government-driven and are open to the  public.  Most
              of these services are free.


              The Department of Home Affairs indicated that it is unable  to
              provide these services in areas where they are needed most due
              to security reasons. The PIT system and MPPC concept are  very
              useful. Is there integration with other departments?  Are  PIT
              centres prone to vandalism?


              In terms of service delivery, people look  to  government  and
              not to departments. Negotiations about integrating  government
              services have begun.


              There are no statistics on vandalism in relation to  PITs.  It
              is very hard to vandalise the facility since it is  placed  in
              secure  areas  inside  the  post   office.   In   respect   of
              maintenance,  managers  are  required  to  keep  a  record  of
              malfunctions and the relevant companies are ready to  maintain
              the facility.


              What is the relationship with the Department of Home Affairs?


              The Department of Home Affairs is  not  participating  in  the
              project.
              What is a gateway project?


              A gateway project is similar to the MPCC concept.   It  is  an
              initiative  of  the   Department   of   Public   Service   and
              Administration. Facilities similar to those of MPCCs. They are
              established  in  urban  areas  where  different   departmental
              services are offered to the public.


              What is V-sats?


              V-sats is a Saphan,  a  local  area  network  satellite  which
              requires a Telkom or Eskom line to operate.


              What is the purpose of the proposed system on animal  branding
              by the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs?


              The system is aimed at assisting and controlling the  movement
              of animals and keeping them quarantined in  the  event  of  an
              outbreak of disease.


              Would it be possible for a child to collect the pension  grant
              for a pensioner by using the smart card system?


              It is not possible because  the  system  requires  fingerprint
              identity.


              Recommendations by Committee


              The revelations on the lack of participation by the Department
              of Home Affairs needed to  be  deliberated  further  with  the
              Select Committee on Social Services  and  Department  of  Home
              Affairs.


         2.  Report  on  oversight  visit  to   telecommunications   sector:
              Universal Services Agency


              Visit to Mankweng Telecentre


              Ms Maleka, a member of the community and board member  of  the
              telecentre welcomed the Committee. On arrival  the  delegation
              was met by members of  the  Mankweng  community  and  a  Board
              member who took the delegation on a tour of the telecentre.


              Background


              The telecentre was established as a result of the  initiatives
              by the community who identified the need for such a  facility.
              Through interaction with the  Universal  Service  Agency,  the
              telecentre was opened.


              The telecentre offered services  such  as  computer  training,
              faxing,  telephoning,  photocopying,  e-mailing  and  Internet
              access.


              Findings


              During its  tour  of  the  centre,  it  became  clear  to  the
              delegation that the center was underutilised. There were a few
              facilities that were offered to the  public,  and  those  that
              were available could not be used properly. For example,  there
              were three public booths without telephones.  One  person  was
              using a computer. The photocopier and the fax machine were  in
              working order. The building was also used as a day-care centre
              for young toddlers.


              Successes of the telecentre
              People no longer have to walk long distances  to  make  calls,
              surf the Internet or use a fax machine. Through training  some
              have become computer literate.


              The  following  were  highlighted  as  challenges  facing  the
              community of Mankweng


              *   The high level of crime and burglaries made  it  difficult
                for the centre to function optimally.


              *   The equipment in the centre was in need of repair.


              *   In  respect  of  connectivity,  the  center  ran  up  huge
                telephone accounts as a result of the technology supplied by
                Telkom, which was not conducive for internet operations - it
                took long to download information.


              *   Some members of the community competed with the centre  by
                operating public telephone cubicles in the vicinity.


              Question-and-answer session
              How frequently do members of the community use the  facilities
              in the centre?


              After the centre's door were opened, 70% of the community  was
              using the facility. However, due to challenges indicated,  the
              numbers have dwindled. Attempts are under way by the Universal
              Service  Agency  to  understand  the  problem   and   consider
              solutions in order to encourage more usage of  the  centre  by
              the community.


              Is there  accreditation  for  lessons/courses  learnt  at  the
              centre?


              In the absence of a  centre  manager,  no  training  is  being
              offered. Learners attend training at the neighbouring centres.
              The USA has a contract with the Wits  Link  Centre,  by  which
              managers are offered  a  train-the-trainer  course,  which  is
              accredited by Wits Technikon.
              After training, does  the  centre  assist  the  trainees  with
              placements?


              The centre does not have a  direct  placement  plan.  However,
              most of the learners who underwent  training  obtain  jobs  as
              volunteers with the Department of Public Works, as well as  in
              the schools around the area.


              Is it not possible for Telkom to adjust their tariffs?


              The USA tried to negotiate with Telkom on this matter, but  no
              deals could be reached.


              How does the USA ensure that the relevant skills are  acquired
              through the telecentre?


              The USA has devised a system where,  before  giving  training,
              individuals are required to commit themselves for 18 months in
              order to receive substantial training and acquire the relevant
              skills from the facility.


              Recommendations by Committee


              *   The community requests the USA to provide for the security
                of the premises in order to minimise theft and burglary.


              *   The USA needs to employ a co-ordinator  who  would  liaise
                with  its  head  office  with   regard   to   the   centre's
                requirements.


              *   Telkom's digital connections must be  changed,  since  the
                current  system  results  in  a  long  wait  before  one  is
                connected and in huge telephone accounts.


              Word of thanks


              Mrs Ramodibe extended a word of appreciation on behalf of  the
              Committee.


              Concluding remarks on the report


              Mrs  Nkuna,  Chairperson  of  the  Committee,   informed   the
              community that the Committee would  submit  a  report  on  the
              visit to Parliament. She encouraged the community to  keep  an
              eye on each other, since mostly persons within  the  community
              committed the burglaries.  It  is  only  once  all  these  are
              handled that security  companies  can  be  introduced  at  the
              centre.

     Tenth Report of the Working Group  on  the  African  Union  (as  at  18
     November 2003):


     Following on its Ninth Report, the Working Group would like  to  report
     as follows:


     (1)    Ratification of the Pan African Parliament (PAP) Protocol


        The PAP Protocol requires ratification  by  a  simple  majority  of
         Member States that are party  to  the  original  AEC  Treaty  which
         provided for the Pan African Parliament. There are 47  states  that
         are signatories to that Treaty and therefore  24  instruments  were
         required. In terms of Article 22, the Protocol  enters  into  force
         30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification  by  a
         simple majority of the Member States.


        On 14 November 2003, HE Prof Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the
         AU Commission, announced that  the  Protocol  on  the  Pan  African
         Parliament has received  sufficient  ratifications  to  enter  into
         force after 30 days from that day (14 November 2003).


     (2)    Beginning of first term of office of the Pan African Parliament
        It is the intention of the  Commission  to  convene  the  Inaugural
         Session towards the end of January 2004, probably in the 3rd  week.
         Thus, the Pan African Parliament will  be  established  within  the
         timeframes set by the 2nd Summit of the AU  held  in  Maputo  which
         had resolved that the Pan African Parliament should meet before  31
         January 2004. The  Chairperson  of  the  Commission  is  consulting
         President Chissano, Chairperson of  the  African  Union,  regarding
         the dates for the Inaugural Session and confirmation of the  venue.
         The Resolution of the Summit relating to the PAP had also  stressed
         the importance of setting up this  organ  "which  will  ensure  the
         effective and full participation of  the  African  Peoples  in  the
         Development and Integration of the Continent".


     (3)    Election of delegation to the Pan African Parliament


        The Working Group would like to draw to the attention of the  House
         the following provisions of the Protocol:


         -  Each Member State  shall  be  represented  in  the  Pan  African
              Parliament by five Parliamentarians,  at  least  one  of  whom
              shall be a woman (Article 4.1);


         -   The  representation  of  each  Parliament  shall  reflect   the
              diversity of political opinions in each national Parliament or
              other deliberative organ (Article 4.2);


         -  The Pan African Parliamentarians shall be elected or  designated
              by  the   respective   National   Parliaments   and/or   other
              deliberative Organs of the  Member  States  from  among  their
              members (Article 5.1);


         -  The Pan African Parliamentarians shall vote  in  their  personal
              and independent capacity (Article 6);


         -  Membership of the Pan African Parliament shall  be  incompatible
              with the exercise of executive  or  judicial  functions  in  a
              Member State (Article 7);


         -  The Pan African Parliament shall elect,  at  its  first  sitting
              following its election,  by  secret  ballot,  from  among  its
              members and in  accordance  with  its  Rules  of  Procedure  a
              President and four Vice Presidents representing the Regions of
              Africa, as determined by the OAU (now AU). The election shall,
              in each case, be by simple majority of the members present and
              voting (Article 12.2).


         The Working Group recommends:


         (a)     That the Houses elect the five members who are to serve  on
              the Pan African Parliament in terms of the Protocol. It should
              be noted that the delegation will comprise members  from  both
              Houses.


         (b)     That parties need to discuss and agree on  the  composition
              of the delegation and the election process.


         The Working Group in its Eighth Report gave  the  following  option
         regarding representation:  If  the  largest  party  is  to  have  a
         majority - three members from the largest  party  and  two  members
         from among other parties.


         In the same report, the Working Group  recommended  that  at  least
         three of the members should be women. This report  was  adopted  by
         the Council on 23 September 2003.
         Once these members have  been  elected,  Parliament  will  need  to
         inform the AU Commission by 30 November 2003, indicating the  names
         of the members, the process of their election and their  curriculum
         vitaes so that representativity can be considered.


         The Commission has indicated that a Credentials Committee  will  be
         set up  before  the  Inaugural  Session.  The  Committee  will  not
         accredit  any  representatives  who  do  not   conform   with   the
         stipulated requirements of gender and political diversity.


         The  Commission  has  also   distributed   for   consideration   by
         Parliaments the "Draft Oaths of Office" for Members  and  Presiding
         Officers. Parliament also needs to  make  recommendations  on  what
         committees should be set up at the Inaugural Session,  as  well  as
         the nature of the debate to be held at that  Session.  The  Working
         Group is currently considering these matters with a view to  making
         recommendations.


     (4)    Reporting Mechanisms
        Parliament should also consider how the five  members  of  the  PAP
         will report. The  Working  Group  has  previously  recommended  the
         establishment of a Committee, before the Inaugural Session  of  the
         PAP, to process and deal with issues  emanating  from  the  African
         Union and the Southern African Development Community  Parliamentary
         Forum (SADC-PF). The Committee  would  also  discuss  mandates  and
         receive reports from the members of the PAP with a view to  tabling
         them.


     The Working Group recommends:


     (a)    That a  Committee  on  the  African  Union  be  established,  as
         previously proposed and agreed to by the House when it adopted  the
         Eighth Report.


     (b)    That the terms of reference of the Committee as suggested in the
         Eighth  Report  be  amended  to  exclude  the  SADC-PF   and   SADC
         Parliament, pending developments in that regard.

National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the  Intervention  in  the  Mafikeng
     Local Municipality, dated 31 October 2003, as follows:


     The Ad Hoc Committee established by the National Council  of  Provinces
     in terms of Rule  160(1)(a),  having  considered  the  application  for
     approval of an intervention made in accordance with  section  139(1)(b)
     of the Constitution, by the provincial government  of  the  North  West
     Province in the Mafikeng Local Municipality, referred to it, reports as
     follows:


     Background to the intervention


     The current situation in the Mafikeng Local Municipality (Municipality)
     is such that it cannot fulfil its constitutional obligations  in  terms
     of section 152 of the Constitution.


     The Municipality faces severe shortcomings in its budget and cash  flow
     management. As a result, its financial condition and ability to deliver
     essential services has been  seriously  compromised  and  continues  to
     deteriorate.  The  deterioration  has  also  been  attributed  to  poor
     financial planning and administration  and  the  inability  to  collect
     monies owed to the Municipality. This impacted on the capacity  of  the
     municipality  to  deliver  free  basic   services   to   its   indigent
     communities. At present  the  Municipality's  expenditure  exceeds  its
     monthly income.


     The Municipal Manager, as well as many other officials were  suspended.
     A senior official from the Department was seconded to the  Municipality
     in the position  of  acting  Municipal  Manager.  The  Speaker  of  the
     Municipality had been requested to resign in April 2003.


     The acting Municipal Manager and new Mayor have, since  taking  office,
     begun to implement certain turn  around  strategies  and  cost  cutting
     initiatives. However, it was  noted  that,  for  the  purposes  of  the
     intervention,  it  would  be  impossible  to   separate   areas   where
     performance was satisfactory from those where it was not.


     Summation


     Following the demarcation process, completed in December 2000, Mafikeng
     Local Municipality incorporated rural areas and it now covers a  bigger
     area, which is 25% urban and 75% rural. Its equitable  share  does  not
     reflect the demographics and the needs of the Municipal area.  However,
     its budget has since increased by 9%. The Municipality has few  sources
     of income, besides the bulk water supply and rates and taxes. The  lack
     of  income  impacts  negatively  on  service  delivery.  The  cost   of
     developing its rural areas is  largely  being  borne  by  the  property
     owners in Mafikeng through taxes, as most residents  are  too  poor  to
     develop the broader area. It appears that this results in excessive tax
     and an undue burden on these property owners.


     Terms of the intervention
     On 3 September 2003, the Provincial Executive launched an  intervention
     in the Municipality in terms of section 139(1)(b) of the  Constitution.
     The MEC for Developmental Local Government and Housing,  on  behalf  of
     the provincial government, submitted a notice to the  National  Council
     of Provinces to approve the intervention, which  effectively  commenced
     on 4 September 2003, in compliance with section 139 (2)(a)(ii)  of  the
     Constitution.


     The North West  Provincial  Government  is  seeking  approval  for  its
     intervention on the following terms:


              To produce a service delivery plan for the  entire  municipal
              area in terms of all its powers and functions as stipulated in
              Schedule 4 Part B and Schedule 5 Part B of  the  Constitution,
              subject to the Minister's authorisation and  MEC's  adjustment
              of powers and functions as provided for in Section 84  of  the
              Municipal Structures Act, 1998 (Act 117 of 1998)
             To develop a financial management plan for the Municipality  to
              include the following:


              -   A cost recovery plan
              -   Debt management and control
              -   Cost cutting measures
              -   Cash management plan
              -   Credit control policy
              -   Indigent policy


              To develop a plan for the placement of staff
              To develop performance agreements for all  employees  covered
              by Section 57 of the Municipal Systems Act
              To review all existing delegations to empower the Council and
              Executive to drive the change plan
              To finalise the Integrated Development Plan and  link  it  to
              the budget
              To finalise all service level agreements  with  the  relevant
              service authorities  (for  example  water,  electricity,  fire
              services etc).


     As a result, the terms  of  reference  of  the  intervention  would  be
     restricted to the following functional areas of the Municipality:


         Financial situation of the Municipality
         Integrated Development Plan
         Political problems
         Service delivery
         Debt management
         Staff complement of the Municipality
         Cost-cutting measures


     Financial situation of the Municipality


     The Municipality's current budget is comparatively low, at R120 million-
     R140 million. By 30 June 2003 the  Municipality's  outstanding  debtors
     amounted to R195 million. The acting Municipal Manager was not able  to
     confirm the amount of  R195  million.  Since  there  are  no  financial
     systems in  place  in  the  Municipality  and  the  billing  system  is
     inadequate there is a dispute about arrear amounts for  services  owing
     to  the  Municipality.  Cheques  amounting   to   R1,6   million   were
     dishonoured, due to insufficient funds, at the end of June  2003.  This
     resulted in the possibility of legal action  being  taken  against  the
     Municipality.  The  provincial  Department   has   had   to   pay   the
     Municipality's water bills and negotiate with banks on their behalf.


     The personnel cost as a percentage of the  total  budget  exceeds  50%,
     which is far above the national norm of 33-35%. Salaries  of  personnel
     employed in accordance with Section 57 of the  Municipal  Systems  Act,
     who are accountable directly to the Municipal Manager were  decided  on
     without a Council resolution.


     The Municipality's overdraft increased from R7 to R11 million and stood
     at R18 million when the new Mayor came into office. The Municipality no
     longer  has  an  overdraft,  which  was  paid  off  when  the  national
     Department of Public Works advanced R 22 million of an amount of  R  30
     million owed to the Municipality.


     The financial problems experienced by the  Municipality  also  resulted
     from certain decisions taken by the previous Municipal Manager  without
     Council resolution.


     Integrated Development Plan


     The IDP of the Municipality has been implemented on  an  ad  hoc  basis
     from reserve funding and has not been linked to the budget.  There  are
     also no business plans linked to the IDP. The  June  2003  deadline  to
     finalise the IDP was not met because the IDP review was not  completed.
     By October 2003 a draft IDP would have been finalised,  which  will  be
     tabled before Council and circulated to the community. The Municipality
     is seeking donor funding for the implementation.


     In addition, the Municipality is engaging with provincial and  national
     Departments  to  establish  whether  their  developmental  projects  in
     Mafikeng can be linked to the Municipality's  IDP.  Each  Director  has
     been tasked  with  devising  strategies  that  can  be  implemented  by
     November 2003. If the IDP were linked to the budget it would be  easier
     to implement the IDP.


     Political problems


     The Section 106 investigation instituted by the Department  found  that
     the  problems  within  the  Municipality   are   both   political   and
     administrative. Many Councillors are not  familiar  with  the  relevant
     legislation despite workshops and other attempts at capacity  building.
     The political tensions are serious and as  a  result  there  is  little
     cohesion within the  Council.  The  committee  system  is  not  working
     adequately and the ex Mayor and ex Speaker have also  fought  over  who
     should  control  the  committees,  which  are  seen  as   a   political
     constituency. This resulted in a difficult relationship  between  these
     two office bearers and resulted in the appointment of a new  Mayor  and
     the new Speaker.


     From 2000 to 2003 the  Council  did  not  receive  information  on  the
     financial status of the Municipality from the ex Mayor,  including  the
     ex Municipal Manager, who never reported  to  the  Council  on  service
     delivery. However, since the appointment of the  new  Mayor  there  has
     been improvement in communication between the Mayors'  Office  and  the
     Council.


     Service Delivery


     There is no visible service delivery in Mafikeng.


     National resolutions on basic service delivery need to be implemented.


     Rural areas are currently being prioritised especially where  there  is
     no  development.  Although  such  development  will  improve  with  the
     implementation of an IDP, until proper financial management systems are
     in place, the IDP cannot be implemented.


     With regard to  the  delivery  of  houses,  roads  and  so  forth,  the
     Municipality will also work with the  Provincial  Department  of  Local
     Government and Housing. A decision was taken to provide  60  kilolitres
     of free water, the provision of which began in July 2003. No  agreement
     has yet been signed with Eskom on the  provision  of  50  kilowatts  of
     electricity. The Municipality  is  also  working  towards  putting  the
     appropriate infrastructure in place for service delivery.


     There is an uncoordinated approach to land sales. The land register  is
     not completely accurate and in addition  there  are  inter-governmental
     disputes about who owns certain portions of land and also disputes with
     traditional communities.


     All the former "Bantustans" had all or some of  their  responsibilities
     taken away from them prior to 1994 when there was no  system  of  local
     government in  place.  In  1992  the  former  Bophutatswana  had  their
     electricity distribution license taken from them. When  the  Bantustans
     were formally incorporated into South Africa in 1994 Eskom subsequently
     took over the license to distribute electricity in Mafikeng,  diverting
     much needed revenue from the Municipality. Mafikeng is therefore one of
     the few municipalities  with  no  coverage  of  its  own  jurisdiction.
     Special consideration must be given to such  struggling  municipalities
     which previously relied on the income from selling electricity.


     On 30 September 2003 an agreement should have been signed  with  Eskom,
     nationally, to provide free service in the provinces. However,  in  the
     North West province Eskom has stated that they are not  ready,  as  the
     provincial division of Eskom has not received a  mandate  from  Eskom's
     national office.
     Debt Management


     The Municipality's financial  system  has  no  "performance  management
     aspects", which means that it is essentially  an  accounting  financial
     system.  The  debtors'  amount  of  R195  million  reflected   in   the
     Municipality's records is in dispute due to inadequacies in the billing
     system.


     Payments from consumers come  in  too  slowly  and,  in  addition,  the
     Municipality's credit control policy, which is also inadequate, is  not
     being implemented properly. The Municipality is not in  a  position  to
     cut off the electricity or water supply to non-payers since it  is  not
     the distributor.


     Reports from the Auditor-General are generally not followed up and as a
     result there is a recurrence of the same audit queries.


     The current rate of payment for services is 60-65%, which is very  low.
     Although this rate has improved in the past two months, it needs to  be
     sustained.


     There is no profit to subsidise services and this results in very  high
     water and electricity rates. Eskom paid a loss in income profit to  the
     Municipality twice, but these payments have since stopped.


     Bulk water supply is being bought from Botshelo Water Board, which acts
     as the middleperson between the  Municipality  and  the  Department  of
     Water  Affairs  and  Forestry.  Built  into  the  amount  paid  by  the
     Municipality is a water tariff, which is due to the Department of Water
     Affairs and Forestry, but the Botshelo Water Board do not pay this over
     which means that the Municipality is effectively subsidising the  Water
     Board. If  the  Municipality  could  acquire  this  bulk  water  supply
     function, it would create savings and ease the cash flow problems.


     Staff


     Staff placement in the new structure required by  the  IDP  has  almost
     been finalised. Prior to 30 June 2003 more than 50% of the  budget  was
     allocated to personnel. This was due to the high numbers of contractual
     employees, some without job descriptions. The assessment of the IDP was
     that the staff  structure  was  too  bloated.  This  will  need  to  be
     considered in the IDP review process and possibly the budget review.


     Each directorate is required to stipulate how  many  staff  they  need.
     Some people have been paid huge allowances. Council  has  a  policy  on
     these allowances and cost cutting measures have been put in place, even
     to curb the excessive use of consumables. Directors have been requested
     to cut costs.


     Cost-cutting measures


     Following the investigation by the Department and  the  appointment  of
     the acting Municipal Manager, the Municipality has embarked on  certain
     cost cutting measures to avoid reverting to the use of  the  overdraft.
     For instance, spending on personnel costs have  been  reduced.  Council
     took a decision that from 1 August 2003 the payment of allowances would
     be cut.


     Before a new policy on the use of credit cards was implemented, the  ex
     Mayor and ex Municipal Manager were each receiving R10  000,00  monthly
     for entertainment, though the money was often used for  their  personal
     expenditure. It was agreed that the municipal finance department  would
     recover any personal expenditure from their salaries, but this was  not
     done. The new Mayor has since put mechanism to recover the  money  owed
     to the Municipality, and has also stopped the use of credit cards until
     a new policy in this regard is put in place.


     Department's efforts to remedy the situation


     The Provincial Department of Local Government and Housing has developed
     a support plan to assist the Municipality in its turnaround strategies.
     It includes funding for the appointment of an Acting Municipal  Manager
     to replace the current Acting  Municipal  Manager,  a  senior  official
     seconded  from  the  Department.  It  is  also  seeking  to  fund   the
     appointment of turnaround strategists to address the institutional  and
     financial  problems  afflicting  the   Municipality.   The   turnaround
     strategies would not necessarily be to assume the normal  functions  of
     the Municipality but to focus on the finances and cost drivers  of  the
     Municipality. The  framework  of  the  intervention  is  therefore  not
     intended to "take over" certain functions but will focus and advise the
     Municipality on financial issues. This is a more restricted, manageable
     form of intervention.


     A municipal leadership academy  has  also  been  established  to  build
     capacity within municipalities.


     Ending of the Intervention
     According to the MEC, the turnaround would take a minimum of one month;
     following  adjudication  on  1  October,  service  providers  would  be
     appointed.


     The intervention must end when the National  Council  of  Provinces  is
     satisfied that the Municipality is able to  resume  its  constitutional
     responsibilities, that the Municipality is financially viable and  that
     financial control policies are in place and consistently implemented.


     Resolution of the Committee


     The Committee recommends that the intervention in  the  Mafikeng  Local
     Municipality by the North West government be approved.
     Further, that the Office of the MEC  submits  monthly  reports  to  the
     National Council of Provinces,  in  order  to  enable  the  Council  to
     monitor the intervention regularly. These monthly reports should  focus
     on the terms of reference for the intervention as well as the areas  of
     concern raised in the main report.
