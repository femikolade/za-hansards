                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chair. I give notice that I shall move at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with consternation that the unilateral act of war  declared  by
       the United States of America, in a coalition pact with Great Britain,
       against Iraq has already resulted  in  the  loss  of  lives  of  both
       civilians and combatants on both sides;


  (2) further notes that this act of aggression by America and Britain  has
       weakened the sinews of multilateralism  considerably,  especially  as
       the United Nations Security Council, being divided on the issue,  did
       not sanction the act of war by the coalition forces; and


  (3) therefore calls on all South Africans, indeed  the  whole  world,  to
       stand with the people of Iraq, not with the dictator Saddam  Hussein,
       in their hour of anxiety and fear and be prepared to make modest, but
       honourable, contributions to rebuilding a new Iraq,  founded  on  the
       principles of human rights and democracy.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the New NP is fully committed to taking the hands of all  communities
       and to building a South  Africa  where  coloured,  white,  black  and
       Indian South Africans will be playing a meaningful role together;


  (2) the New NP received a mandate from its supporters in 1999  to  ensure
       co-operative government and that the MPs and MPPs who have  left  the
       New NP for the DP/DA are now letting those voters down;


  (3) minorities in South  Africa  have  a  clear  choice  and  that  they,
       together with the DP/DA, can fight back against  the  majority,  they
       can fight back against change and isolate their little group into  an
       enclave and marginalise themselves from the real important issues and
       fight their children right out of South Africa, or they can, together
       with the New NP, take part and  grasp  the  huge  opportunities  that
       exist in our country; and


  (4) through the minorities and the majority working  together,  grappling
       with the problems that need to be overcome, working towards a win-win
       situation, a future of  hope  will  be  created  for  minorities  and
       majority alike in our wonderful country.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mr Krumbock, members are saying that  they  are
very pleased to see you here today. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Thank you, Madam Chair. May  I  respond  that  I  was  very
pleased to see you in Swellendam. I hereby give notice that I shall move  at
the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  the DA convincingly won all five by-elections that it  contested
           on Wednesday, 19 March 2003;


       (b)  the DA's percentage of support  increased  in  the  majority  of
           these by-elections;


       (c)  not only was the right wing, including the FF and CP, crushed in
           Ward 53 Tshwane, but nearly one in five of former ANC supporters
           voted for the DA candidate in Lulekeni Township near Phalaborwa;
           and


       (d)  the New NP finished a distant third in Swellendam; and


  (2) acknowledges further that these watershed results, combined with  the
       mass defections to the DA this week,  proves  yet  again  that  South
       Africa is moving rapidly to a two-party system in  line  with  modern
       democratic states, thereby strengthening our young democracy.

 SOUTH AFRICA ON PRIORITY WATCH LIST OF INTERNATIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                                  ALLIANCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that South Africa has been placed on a priority watch  list  of
       the International Intellectual Property Alliance, a US body dedicated
       to protecting copyright materials;


  (2) further notes that this step was taken as a result of the  activities
       of syndicates smuggling counterfeit DVDs into the country and selling
       them for as little as R60 at flea markets and roadside stalls;


  (3) expresses its concern that from 1996 to 2001, US studios  lost  about
       R96 million annually in South Africa - in 2002 that figure more  than
       doubled with losses of R240 million;


  (4) believes that illegal smuggling of counterfeit goods has  a  damaging
       effect on our own economy in that -


       (a)  brand owners are losing revenue because consumers are opting for
           cheaper items that look the same;


       (b)  jobs are lost in the country; and


       (c)  the State is losing money because taxes are not  paid  on  these
           counterfeit goods; and


  (5) calls on the police to ensure greater  urgency  in  respect  of  this
       problem and to allocate more resources to infiltrate these syndicates
       and  embark  on  full-scale  surveillance  operations  against  these
       syndicates.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    NEW NP MEMBERS WHO CROSSED THE FLOOR

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the New NP members that  crossed  the  floor  to  the  DP  is  a
           temporary setback for the New NP; however, anybody who thinks it
           is more than this is making a major mistake;


       (b)  it is not the first time that the New NP pays a price for  doing
           the right thing for South Africa;


       (c)  in 1982 when the party decided on a policy of power-sharing, the
           party also suffered losses like now, although it was  the  right
           thing to do for South Africa;


       (d)  in 1990 when the New NP decided to negotiate with the ANC  about
           the new democracy in South Africa, many voters voted against the
           party in 1999, because of  the  so-called  sell-out  at  Codesa,
           although those negotiating were also doing the right  thing  for
           South Africa; and


       (e)  now when the New NP decided to work with the ANC to  make  South
           Africa work and to make it a better place for  all  its  people,
           some members decided to cross the floor to the DP; and


  (2) believes that working together for the benefit of all our people  and
       for peace, stability and prosperity is the  right  thing  to  do  for
       South Africa and that the New NP will keep on doing it.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                        HUMILIATING REFERENCES TO DA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E C GOUWS: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes cognisance of the fact that honourable members in this  Council
       have  referred  to  the  DA  in  a  humiliating  way  as  the  ``Dead
       Alliance'';

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order!

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I need your protection.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Order! Hon members, order!

Ms E C GOUWS: I continue:


  (2) notes that, in the light of the number of MPs joining the  DA,  those
       honourable members now re-evaluate that interpretation;


  (3) agrees that the DA is vibrant and growing; and


  (4) is of the view that the real corpse in this House is the  party  that
       is in alliance with the ANC.

I thank you.

[Laughter.] [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  I  am  not  sure  what  members  are  doing.
[Laughter.] That may be the Mexican wave. [Laughter.]  I  am  not  sure.  Is
there any objection to that  motion?  There  is  an  objection.  The  motion
therefore becomes notice of a motion.

                   DEVASTATION CAUSED BY FLOODS IN MONTAGU

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes its concern for the devastation that was caused by  the  floods
       in Montagu;


  (2) expresses its solidarity with the people who have been  afflicted  by
       the storms;


  (3) commends the municipalities, the SA Defence Force,  as  well  as  the
       provincial government for the decisive  steps  they  have  taken  and
       their intervention in the area; and


  (4) wishes the people of Montagu well during this difficult and traumatic
       time.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       kulesi sikole.
(Translation of isiZulu draft resolution follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) applauds what is done by the teachers and the  learners  of  Bizimali
       High School at Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) notes the plight in  which  the  learners  learn,  running  short  of
       classrooms and other learning resources  which  a  learner  needs  in
       order to learn comfortably;


  (3) notes that learners in this school passed very well although some  of
       them received their lessons under the trees;


  (4) notes that 100% of the learners in this school have passed matric  in
       the past three years;


  (5) encourages the teachers and learners to keep up the good work; and


  (6) advises the Department of Education  to  give  serious  attention  to
       these learners so that the standard of education in this  school  can
       improve even more than before.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There was no interpretation service  available.
The motion concerns a particular school that the  member  is  congratulating
on its performance in a range of areas, and seeks acknowledgement  from  the
National Council of the successful educational progress of this school.

Given that there wasn't an interpretation, I would ask that we  ask  that  a
translation be made available, and that we deal  with  this.  Mrs  Vilakazi,
are you satisfied that I have captured the objective of the resolution?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I think that you have done it. You have summarised it.  Of
course they encounter many difficult circumstances.  But  they  got  a  100%
matric pass rate for three successive years. Thank you very  much  for  your
interpretation.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  We  must  ensure  that  we  do  have  services
available for interpretation, particularly during motions, because  being  a
subject that is dealt with without notice, we should be able to provide  the
language interpretation services for the 20 minute period  of  motions.  So,
we will certainly look into improving in that regard.

      CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA THIRD AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I am pleased to welcome and call on  the
Deputy Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development, who is  becoming
a good friend of the National Council of Provinces.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,
Madam Chair. I started my parliamentary  career  in  this  House  and  I  am
definitely attached to it by the hip. It is always a pleasure to be back.  I
bring to you today my Minister's apologies; he is abroad.  This  is  a  very
important piece of legislation and I know  that  he  would  very  much  have
liked to have dealt with it. His loss is obviously my gain. Thank you.

Madam Chair and colleagues, as we seek  innovative  and  practical  ways  to
give systemic support to local government, we need constantly to review  our
policy and legislative environment. Where impediments to  effective  service
delivery are identified, it is  the  duty  of  the  Government  to  approach
Parliament for assistance. The Bill in front  of  us  today  addresses  some
very important issues.
The main objectives of the Bill are the following: It  regulates  provincial
intervention in local government; it provides for Bills  regulating  certain
financial matters to be dealt with in accordance with the procedure set  out
in section 76(1) of the Constitution; it changes the name  of  the  Northern
Province to Limpopo Province; and it simplifies the  process  of  review  by
the National  Council  of  Provinces  in  the  case  of  national  executive
intervention in provincial government.

The original motivation for the changes to section  139  was  to  deal  with
local crises that occur when  municipal  councils  cannot  govern,  or  when
municipalities find themselves in a state of financial  emergency.  The  aim
was to provide a clear process to deal  with  a  municipality  in  financial
crisis. In the absence of such a process, we have  seen  a  few  conspicuous
failures of local  governance  harm  the  reputation  of  the  entire  local
government  sphere  and  create   unnecessary   barriers   for   responsible
municipalities seeking private sector investment. Furthermore, with  such  a
process in  place,  Government  will  be  embarking  on  a  major  drive  to
encourage private sector lending to municipalities.

However, as  deliberations  and  consultations  on  possible  amendments  to
section 139 unfolded over the past two years, it became clear  that  a  more
general reworking of the section  139  mechanism  for  provincial  executive
intervention in local government was needed. For example,  it  is  necessary
to address both the  legislative  responsibilities  of  municipal  councils,
such as the adoption of a timely and  balanced  budget,  and  the  executive
responsibilities of municipalities to  ensure  that  residents  receive  the
services to which they are constitutionally and  morally  entitled.  It  has
also been accepted that national and provincial government must do  more  in
terms of capacity-building,  monitoring  and  supporting  local  government.
Preventing problems is easier and more effective than fixing them.

The amendments to section 139, which regulate  interventions  by  provincial
executives in local government, form the crux of the Bill. These  amendments
provide a comprehensive pathway for interventions by  provincial  executives
in municipalities - a scheme that recognises and preserves  the  role  of  a
democratically elected municipal council and which at the same time  assures
all residents  and  stakeholders  that  serious  or  prolonged  failures  of
governance will be dealt with. They also ensure each municipality's  ability
to deal with its obligation to  provide  basic  services  and  to  meet  its
financial commitments.

The current section 139 limits intervention by a province in a  municipality
where a municipality fails ``to  fulfil  its  executive  obligations''.  The
intervention by the province is discretionary, so a province is not  obliged
to intervene, even if there is a  serious  crisis  in  a  municipality.  The
Constitution  does  not  allow  provinces  to  intervene  where  there   are
legislative failures by  a  municipality,  even  when  such  failures  cause
severe service delivery problems.

Passing a budget, for example, is  a  legislative  measure,  so  a  province
cannot intervene where a municipality fails to pass  a  budget.  This  could
paralyse a municipality and disrupt the  provision  of  essential  services.
The Constitution currently restricts a province's intervention to  executive
failures only.

The changes to section 139 essentially introduce  a  mandatory  intervention
mechanism by a province in the event of a  serious  financial  crisis  in  a
municipality. The amendments to section 139 will therefore serve  to  ensure
that local government meets its  constitutional  obligations  that  include,
among other things, providing services to communities, promoting social  and
economic development and promoting  a  safe  and  healthy  environment.  The
amendments will also enhance investor confidence in  municipalities.  It  is
our opinion that these changes will improve governance in the  local  sphere
by improving access to affordable and quality services.

The general experience with previous  discretionary  interventions  is  that
they occur too late, and are  therefore  invariably  ineffective.  There  is
little evidence to suggest that  interventions  such  as  these  can  happen
swiftly unless they are mandatory.

Smaller changes to section 139 also include a very limited form of  national
intervention where a province fails to intervene, but only when a  mandatory
provincial intervention is relevant. Although the  constitutional  amendment
orginally tabled in  Parliament  in  2001  allowed  national  Government  to
intervene directly in a municipality, the Bill before the NCOP  retains  the
status quo. In other words, only a province  may  intervene  directly  in  a
municipality when an executive  failure  occurs.  National  intervention  is
restricted to a  serious  budget  or  financial  crisis,  and  only  if  the
province fails to intervene as required.

It is the intention of this  legislation,  therefore,  to  ensure  effective
service delivery at local government  level  through  speedy  and  effective
intervention by the provinces, when and where  necessary.  This  legislation
thus removes the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving that goal.  To
this end, I commend this Bill to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I should have  indicated  that  we
have members of a delegation from the Limpopo  Province  who  have  come  to
ensure  that  we  do  approve  this  legislation.  [Laughter.]  A  group  of
educators from the province of Limpopo are  here.  Avuxeni!  [Applause.]  We
welcome them. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, it's a tradition that when a kgoshi  speaks
his subjects must be present. [Laughter.]

Before 1994, we had four administrations in our province, which had to  form
one province. Looking at all the different groupings in our area, we had  to
agree on  a  name  for  our  province.  Because  of  where  we  are  located
geographically, the name Northern Transvaal Province was agreed upon.

After some time, the majority of our people were no longer comfortable  with
the name ``Northern Transvaal'' because there was a rugby team  in  Pretoria
that called itself Northern Transvaal. Just imagine sharing a  name  with  a
rugby team! [Laughter.] It was  then  agreed  to  remove  ``Transvaal''  and
retain ``Northern Province''. We all celebrated the name, and that was it.

We discovered after a while that there are many northern provinces  in  many
parts of the world.  When  some  countries  wanted  to  access  us,  it  was
difficult because the information at times ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon Vilakazi, are you  raising  a  point
of order?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: The member was wrongly identified  on  the  screen  as  Mr
Mkhaliphi. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: This is  Kgoshi  Mokoena,  to  those  who  have
compared him with Mr Mkhaliphi. He is  very  different  from  Mr  Mkhaliphi.
[Laughter.] Proceed, hon member.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. Thank you, Mam' V.

As I was saying, we discovered that there were many  northern  provinces  in
the world and  that  when  some  countries  wanted  to  access  us,  it  was
difficult because at times the information would go to the wrong country.

In addition, we had to market ourselves as a province. It was not  easy,  as
I said, because there are many northern provinces all  over  the  world.  We
then decided to invite the public to propose a name for our province.  There
were some phone-in programmes at our local radio  stations.  Some  wrote  on
small pieces of paper to propose names. We conducted public hearings in  all
our regions. The majority of our people came up with the  name  ``Limpopo''.
This is the isiNdebele word for a river.

Limpopo ka Sesotho sa Leboa ke ``diphororo'' [In Northern Sotho  ``Limpopo''
means ``river''.]

This river links our province with Botswana, Zimbabwe  and  Mozambique.  You
can feel it, hon members, that the name is appetising! [Laughter.]  That  is
where we come from, and that is who we are - Limpopo. Mr Nyakane and I  used
to be harassed by our colleagues hon Kgoali, hon Mkhaliphi  and  hon  Maloi,
who used to call us to order when we called ourselves Limpopo.  Today  those
points of order are gone! [Laughter.] From now onwards we are Limpopo.

There are times when our municipalities cannot function  for  a  variety  of
reasons. This Bill addresses  the  problems  of  municipal  councils  during
interventions. This Bill makes it possible for the  national  executive  and
provincial  governments  to  intervene  if  a  municipality  can  no  longer
function, as was correctly stated by  the  hon  Deputy  Minister.  The  Bill
allows the provincial government to come up with a recovery plan  so  as  to
provide services to our people, if that need arises.
This  Bill  outlines  what  must  be  done  before,  during  and  after   an
intervention. One of the requirements is that a report must be submitted  to
the relevant Minister and to the NCOP after initiating this intervention.

What is good about these amendments is that this Council can disapprove  any
intervention if it feels that the intervention is not necessary.

A concern was raised by Salga that it was not thoroughly consulted and  they
wanted some things to be done their way. I will leave that  in  the  capable
hands of my colleague, hon Mkhaliphi.

There  was  also  a  concern  from  KwaZulu-Natal,  which  objected  to  the
arrangement that the NCOP and the Minister had to approve  an  intervention.
KwaZulu-Natal  proposed  that  the   Council   alone   should   approve   an
intervention.

The question we put forward as the committee and as the Council was:  If  we
wait  until  we  approved  an  intervention,  what  will  happen   if   that
municipality is falling apart and cannot  provide  services?  Obviously,  we
can't wait for that approval until whenever.
If a province initiates an intervention,  and,  during  the  course  of  the
intervention, we feel that  the  intervention  is  not  necessary,  we  will
simply stop it and disapprove it. It is as simple as that.

I am glad that, after a very hectic debate, our  colleagues  finally  agreed
with our argument. What is the use of having a mind if you can't change  it?
We feel it is better to stop the damage and deal with the logistics later.

With these few words, we support the Bill fully. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Thank you, Chairperson. The amendments to the  Constitution
which we seek to introduce through this Bill are important in  a  number  of
respects.

With regard to the amendment in respect of section 76 of  the  Constitution,
a more flexible approach is envisaged in terms of ordinary Bills where  some
of the provisions of such Bills affect the financial interests of  provinces
and others not.

The current practice is to split such Bills into section 75 and  section  76
Bills, which causes practical  problems  and  defeats  clarity.  To  prevent
these problems, the need was  felt  for  a  new  mechanism  which  will  not
necessarily require the splitting of such Bills and will allow  for  a  more
rigorous process in the NCOP; hence the  amendment  to  section  76  of  the
Constitution.

The other two important  areas  which  the  amending  Bill  touches  on  are
interventions in  provincial  and  local  government.  Intervention  by  the
national executive in a province or by a provincial  executive  in  a  local
government does not necessarily  have  to  be  seen  as  an  abandonment  or
renunciation of the principles of co-operative governance. On the  contrary,
an intervention may sometimes be required to strengthen  the  principles  of
co-operative governance. The whole idea around interventions  is  to  ensure
the continuation of good  governance  at  provincial  and  local  government
levels to speed up transformation, reconstruction and development.

Where a  serious  crisis  evolves  in  a  province  or  municipality,  which
threatens  to  sink   the   ship   of   good   governance,   transformation,
reconstruction and development, it may become necessary  for  some  form  of
intervention to steer the ship clear. This is  the  whole  intention  behind
the  interventions.  It  is  not  some  sinister  attempt  to   dilute   the
constitutional provisions relating to the  relative  independence  of  these
spheres of government.

The ANC is committed to upholding the core principles of  our  Constitution,
including the principles of co-operative governance. Indeed, the  amendments
strengthen the role which the National Council of Provinces should  play  in
the event of interventions by the national  executive,  where  a  provincial
administration fails to exercise an executive obligation, or  in  the  event
of interventions by a provincial executive where  a  municipality  fails  to
exercise an executive obligation.

The ultimate aim should of course be to limit the  need  for  interventions.
As the NCOP we must proceed from the basis that interventions  need  not  be
inevitable. They can be prevented.

The need for intervention in a province by the national executive, or  in  a
municipality by a  provincial  executive,  does  not  arise  overnight.  The
executive does not just wake up one morning and says: ``I see province X  is
in trouble. It cannot fulfil this or that executive obligation.''

It is normally a series of problems that will give rise to  a  situation  in
which a  province  or  municipality  can  no  longer  execute  a  particular
executive obligation. The NCOP should be able  to  identify  these  problems
beforehand. What is needed is  an  effective  early-warning  system  through
which developments in provinces  and  municipalities  can  be  monitored  to
identify factors that can and  do  ultimately  lead  to  a  situation  where
intervention will be needed.

When the time arrives where intervention  is  urgently  required,  the  NCOP
will know of it beforehand and will not be taken by surprise.  This  is  one
of the main challenges confronting us as permanent delegates  of  the  NCOP.
How do we use our special position to pick up on problems  in  provinces  or
municipalities, and become more resourceful  in  dealing  with  them  before
they give rise to  a  situation  which  merits  intervention?  That  is  the
question, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Would you like me to answer? [Laughter.]
Mrs E N LUBIDLA: We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Dumelang Bagetsu! [I greet  all  of  you!]  [Applause.]  I  am
afraid my Setswana is still in its very infant stages and I  cannot  proceed
much further than that. [Laughter.] But at least the effort is  being  made,
I can assure the House.

The Constitution of the  Republic  of  South  Africa  Third  Amendment  Bill
should be considered together with the Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill.
The two are interlinked and it would be  preferable  not  to  consider  them
separately. Despite a number of requests  in  the  select  committee  to  be
briefed on the Municipal Finance Management Bill, sadly this  did  not  take
place. The  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill  started  as  a  system  of
transparency and budgetary oversight, and as a fiscal watch  over  budgetary
processes at local level. It has ended in onerous  prescriptions  and  broad
new discretionary intervention powers and an amendment of  the  Constitution
that diminishes the oversight of the NCOP with regard to interventions.

In  respect  of  the  constitutional  trumping  clause  contained   in   the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Third Amendment Bill,  we  need
to ask ourselves whether we are supporting and  strengthening  the  capacity
of municipalities to manage their own affairs, given  that  they  raise  the
bulk  of  their  own  revenue,  or  are  we  simply   stifling   them   with
prescriptions  emanating  from  the  National  Treasury  and   a   potential
avalanche of discretionary interventions by either  provincial  or  national
government?

There are four stages of intervention set out  in  the  new  amendments.  In
terms of section 139(1), (2) and (3), the intervention is discretionary  and
a range of options are available to the MEC, including  dissolution  of  the
council in exceptional  circumstances.  In  terms  of  section  139(4),  the
intervention is mandatory and the MEC must act if a  municipality  fails  to
fulfil  an  obligation  in  terms  of  the  Constitution  or  in  terms   of
legislation to approve a budget or to adopt any revenue-raising  measure  to
give effect to the budget.

In terms of section 139(5), not only is the intervention  mandatory  in  the
event of financial crisis, or where a municipality breaches  its  obligation
to provide basic services or fails to meet its  financial  commitments,  but
the  provincial  executive  may  impose  a  recovery   plan,   binding   the
municipality to  its  executive  and  legislative  functions.  This  may  be
untenable.

As a last resort, of course, in  section  139(7),  national  Government  may
intervene instead of the province if the province fails to act.

This scheme  is  problematic.  There  is  too  much  discretion.  The  lines
delineating provincial and national responses are too indistinct.  We  agree
that local government financial management is in a very  parlous  state.  We
agree that we need a PFMA-type  system  for  local  government  to  function
properly  and  to  deliver  services  to  our  people.  We  agree  that  our
Constitution sets up a specific governance architecture  with  three  levels
of government, with distinctive powers and functions under  a  broad  rubric
of co-operative governance. We disagree fundamentally on whether or  not  it
is desirable to undo and negotiate constitutional architecture  through  the
introduction of a new card game, like the trumping clause  that  emasculates
many of the other constitutional provisions aimed at  protecting  the  local
sphere of government and its integrity.

The system of provincial intervention we create today will be  adding  flesh
to the Municipal Finance Management Bill and  will  have  to  meet  all  the
requirements of section 41(1)(g) of  our  Constitution.  The  constitutional
amendment  before  us  today  impacts  on  the  executive,  legislative  and
administrative functions of local government.

Finally, save for changing the name of the Northern Province to Limpopo -  I
am sure Kgoshi Mokoena is much relieved by that - the  DA  will  oppose  the
amendments in respect of the third amending Bill. [Applause.]

Mr B J  MKHALIPHI:  Mgcinisihlalo,  nine  bekunene,  ngiyabonga  kunginiketa
lelitfuba. [Chairperson, hon  members,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  this
opportunity.]

One of the prominent attributes of a constitutional democracy like  ours  is
consistency of policies. By consistency we not only mean similar actions  in
all cases, but we also mean acting  in  tandem  with  the  thinking  of  the
prevailing  constitutional  dispensation,  as  amplified  in  our   evolving
intergovernmental  relations,  especially   the   intergovernmental   fiscal
relations.

This arrangement ensures that every citizen and every sphere  of  government
knows exactly what role to play and what to  expect  of  Government  at  any
given time. Even a municipality or province that falls into the trap of  not
fulfilling its role knows exactly what will happen to it at that  particular
time.

We do not have the classic case which prevailed in the then apartheid  South
Africa, where a certain bantustan was deprived of its allocation because  it
would not opt for independence.  With  our  democracy  we  know  that  every
allocation, and every action that is taken against a  sphere  of  government
that is in default, is legislated and agreed beforehand, so that when we  do
take steps to rectify actions those actions are known beforehand.

Notwithstanding what I have said,  I  will  concede  that  interventions  by
their very nature can be considered intrusive measures into  another  sphere
of government. Therefore it impacts on, and even  undermines,  the  relative
independence of a sphere of government. But, as I've said,  it  is  preceded
by deliberations and informed by legislation. So, if you talk of  intrusion,
it is a regulated form of intrusion and therefore we call it intervention.

If I had it my way, I would have arranged matters  in  the  Constitution  in
such a way that, before you even think of section 139 and 100,  you  go  via
section 154(1) of the Constitution, which reads:


  The national government and provincial governments,  by  legislative  and
  other  measures,  must   support   and   strengthen   the   capacity   of
  municipalities to manage their own affairs, to exercise their powers  and
  to perform their functions.

If we did not have a very intricate system of  intergovernmental  relations,
indeed our interventions would have been called out of order. In that  case,
it could be said that we were cutting off our nose to spite  our  face.  But
we have ensured that before we think of sections 139 and 100,  the  support,
supervision and  measures  that  are  necessary  in  terms  of  finance  and
administration are in place to ensure that municipalities and provinces  are
able to perform their functions as expected by their communities.  We  could
also say that the measures we are now  introducing  and  contemplating  this
afternoon constitute some form of peer review.

We have heard  some  inputs  from  organised  local  government  that  would
suggest that we also  intervene  if  municipalities  are  failing  in  their
executive functions. We could not contemplate  that.  To  be  practical,  it
would be foolhardy of us to think that a vehicle can move  when  its  engine
has stopped. By its very nature, the executive committee of  a  municipality
is the engine of that municipality. If the engine has failed, we don't  have
a vehicle, so we scrap the vehicle and don't allow it to drive on the road.

These amendments are also informed by case studies  that  we  have  followed
and  carefully  scrutinised.  I  am   referring   to   our   experience   in
Viljoenskroon, Ogies and many other places. We therefore have no doubt  that
these amendments are necessary in order to take our democracy in  the  local
sphere of government a step further. I thank you. [Applause.]

Cllr C JOHNSON (Salga): Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister,  hon  members,  it
is indeed an honour to participate in this debate  on  the  Constitution  of
the Republic of South Africa Third Amendment Bill of 2002.

The amendment of section 139 of the Constitution, which is the main body  of
this amending Bill, has been in the public domain for close  on  two  years.
The main purpose of the initial version of the amendment was  to  facilitate
the intervention by other spheres into the local sphere when a  municipality
was experiencing a ``financial emergency'', as it was then called.

The initial version of the amendment  to  section  139  made  provision  for
severe inroads into the sphere of local government. It provided  for  direct
intervention by the national sphere into the local sphere, as  well  as  the
power to adopt a budget for a municipality.

The SA Local Government Association adopted  a  very  clear  and  principled
position in respect of the  initial  proposals.  In  summary,  it  made  the
following points. Salga affirmed and supported  the  current  constitutional
status  of  local  government,  and  the  current  constitutional  framework
wherein the supervision of municipalities  amounts  to  monitoring,  support
and, in the last instance, intervention by the  province.  Salga  reiterated
its stance that adequate monitoring and support will obviate  the  need  for
interventions  by  provinces,  and  its  stance  that  a  clear  legislative
framework for provincial supervision was urgently needed and  long  overdue.
Salga was, and still is, firmly of the view that the financial viability  of
municipalities is not dependent on the ability of other actors to  intervene
in  municipal  affairs.  It  also  believed  that  the  current  regime  for
supervision was adequate and that the then proposed amendments,  in  so  far
as they made inroads  into  the  legislative  authority  of  municipalities,
undermined the constitutional integrity of local government.

The Bill currently before this House took the views  of  Salga  firmly  into
account. This was made possible through the active  participation  of  Salga
in the deliberation process  in  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and
Constitutional Development.  Allow  me  to  express  our  gratitude  to  the
chairperson  of  Portfolio   Committee   on   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, Adv Johnny de Lange, for allowing us  the  latitude  to  engage
with members of the committee to convince them of  the  correctness  of  our
views.
Salga supports the Bill now before this House. The Bill, in  so  far  as  it
relates to section 139 of the Constitution,  still  maintains  the  original
intention of the constitutional drafters. In terms of the Bill, the  overall
responsibility for monitoring, support and intervention remains firmly  with
the provincial sphere. It also maintains  and  preserves  the  institutional
integrity of local government by  not  allowing  any  intervention  to  make
inroads into the legislative authority of a municipality.

While Salga appreciates the need to amend section 139, so as  to  facilitate
the implementation of Chapter 13 of the Municipal Finance  Management  Bill,
there is still a glaring omission in the total scheme  of  the  intervention
framework. There is still no national legislation in place to  regulate  the
processes  in  section  139(1)  and  (2),  or  the  so-called   nonfinancial
interventions.

There is a critical need to have such legislation because, most  often,  the
need for interventions would  arise  because  of  the  nonfulfilment  of  an
executive obligation. Where such nonfulfilment is left unattended, it  would
escalate into a  financial  emergency.  The  chairperson  of  Salga,  Father
Mkhatshwa,  made  this  point  in  his  address  to  the   inaugural   Salga
Consultative Assembly of Mayors in Rustenburg, and  we  have  repeated  this
call for legislation in our submission to the portfolio committee.

In our view, the legislation must provide for the rendering  of  support  to
municipalities and for  intervention  where  support  has  failed.  Building
capacity can be seen as the main purpose for  rendering  support.  This  can
take place through the  training  of  staff  and  councillors,  through  the
provision of material and technical support,  making  available  legislative
support systems through methods of skills transfer, and through the  sharing
of resources.

In respect of the requests by municipalities for support, there is  a  clear
need for legislation to determine issues such as when and  how  support  may
be requested; the role of organised local government in  that  process;  the
identification of instances  where  support  may  be  imposed,  for  example
disaster management; and general criteria in terms of which indicators  that
show a need for support may be drawn up.

In terms of a clear framework for interventions, the following  issues  must
be provided for  in  legislation.  Prior  to  intervention,  there  must  be
statutory recognition of the  role  of,  and  consultation  with,  organised
local government within  the  province  and  the  NCOP.  There  must  be  an
obligation to  report  regularly  to  organised  local  government  and  the
provincial standing committee. Permanent intergovernmental  structures  must
be  established  at  provincial  level  to  provide  for   consultation   on
identification of problems, terms  of  intervention,  reporting  mechanisms,
and the appointment of an administrator. Interventions must be  preceded  by
measures  to  support  and  strengthen  local  government  in  general   and
municipalities in particular. Provincial  commissions  of  inquiry  must  be
preceded by consultations with organised local government, and a  regulatory
framework to capacitate provinces to deal with interventions.

Furthermore, it would  be  ideal  if  a  uniform  framework  for  provincial
supervision  could  be  contained  either  in  an  Act  of  Parliament  that
regulates intergovernmental relations or in a stand-alone Act.

This legislation adds to the ever-expanding framework legislation for  local
government. As Salga, we are mindful that our system of local government  is
young and that our legislature  must  take  care  not  to  overburden  local
government with legislative and  executive  obligations.  We  are  confident
that this Bill, together  with  the  soon-to-be  enacted  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill, will provide the necessary platform  for  local  government
to continue delivering on our promise for a better life for all and  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R RATSHITANGA (Northern Province): Chairperson, and hon members  of  this
House, I am not going to bother this House by  touching  on  the  aspect  of
intervention  by  a  provincial  executive  or  the  national  executive  in
municipalities when they fail to render a particular service. I fully  agree
with what other members such as hon Mkhaliphi have aptly described.

My address will deal with the change of name from the Northern  Province  to
Limpopo. This is because it affects me  very  much,  as  I  come  from  that
province, and I was in the committee that dealt with that. The  name  change
from Northern Province to Limpopo could not have come at a better time  than
the present, for several reasons.

To begin with, the change of name sets the historical and  political  record
straight. All of you who are present here  will  agree  with  me  that  most
civilisations in the world that we read about,  talk  about  and  praise  so
much have been associated with rivers. At least, I don't know  of  any  that
is not associated with  a  river.  With  this  river  in  particular,  which
according to SA National Geographic  Names  means  ``small  waterfalls''  as
Kgoshi Mokoena aptly said, quite a number of civilisations were  established
and nurtured.

I may remind this august House that after the hunting and  gathering  period
came to a close, the Mapungubwe civilisation was  established  and  nurtured
by this very river. After that, the Great Zimbabwe civilisation ensued.  Not
only that, but we have a famous history that deals  with  the  manufacturing
of guns in that region around Sofala, where the famous Mondlani was born  at
another stage. We are very proud of this civilisation, which was  associated
with the smelting of iron at Tshimbupfe and  the  mining  of  gold  in  that
area, as well as the mining of copper.

To  some  of  us  the  renaming  of  the  province  means  that  indeed  the
civilisations that  would  otherwise  have  been  buried,  will  perhaps  be
remembered. This amendment has caused us to remember the  people  who  lived
in that part of the country, where  they  civilised  themselves,  like  many
others in this great country and on the greatest continent. We  have  learnt
a lot about these civilisations, and much still remains  to  be  learnt,  as
archeology continues to dig up more evidence.

The change of name from Northern Province to Limpopo also  has  to  do  with
another aspect of civilisation, namely that South Africans, led by the  ANC,
had  to  change  the  political  affairs  of  this  country  from  that   of
colonialism and the apartheid regime to the democracy we enjoy  today.  This
occurred because of freedom fighters, many of whom crossed this river  while
going to the mecca of the  struggle,  Lusaka.  This  history,  as  President
Mbeki aptly says, should be written. It must also  be  part  of  the  entire
history of this country during this epoch.

The change of name occurs because tourists and investors  from  abroad  were
having problems locating us, because there are many  northern  provinces  in
the world, as Kgoshi Mokoena aptly said. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, it seems today is a day  of  celebrations.  The
colleague from the Limpopo explained to  us  now  why  the  name  change  is
necessary. From the Western Cape we want to  congratulate  the  now  Limpopo
Province on their new name. We are indeed sure that this will  lead  to  new
prosperity in that province. So, congratulations  colleagues,  on  your  new
name.

The other celebration is  the  fact  that  Salga  is  in  the  House  today.
[Applause.] They have not been here for a very long time.  The  contribution
that the hon member made here was very  interesting.  I  must  advise  Salga
that the buck doesn't stop with the  portfolio  committee  of  the  National
Assembly. The buck stops with the committee of the NCOP.  The  contributions
that the member made today would have been wonderful if he had made them  in
our committee. [Interjections.] There was even a mandate  from  the  Eastern
Cape that specifically asked: What about Salga's contribution?

The fact is that Salga is part of the National Council  of  Provinces.  That
is why we negotiated the Constitution to bring in third-tier government  and
to make this the place for you. But it seems to us in this House - and I  am
not fighting with  you  -  that  you  are  negotiating  with  the  portfolio
committee of the National Assembly. It could be the  right  place;  that  is
where it starts, but the buck stops in the NCOP. I want to appeal to you  to
participate more in our committees. Come and  make  the  contributions  that
you made today. It is wonderful and that is what we want. We have missed  it
for a long time.

I am not going to say much about  the  legislation.  The  Minister  and  our
chairperson have covered everything. From the Western Cape  we  support  the
legislation. Thank you very much to our chairperson for the efforts that  he
made, also to accommodate KwaZulu-Natal to  a  large  extent.  I  think  the
legislation is good legislation and we support it. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, just yesterday Kgoshi  Mokoena  presented  the
final mandate from the Northern Province/Limpopo. Unfortunately, at the  top
was  written  ``Northern  Province'',  and  at   the   bottom   ``Limpopo''.
[Laughter.]

We were not sure whether we should call them Limpopo or  Northern  Province.
We are happy that today we are doing away with  that  confusion.  Hopefully,
from now on we'll call them Limpopo, and the North West supports that.

The Select Committee on Local  Government,  at  that  time  led  by  Mahomed
Bhabha, visited an area  called  Stilfontein  in  the  North  West.  We  had
meetings with councillors, people who deal with administration, the  manager
for finance, the CEO, everybody. But something which was  not  palatable  to
members  of  the   committee   was   that   whilst   we   were   intervening
administratively, it appeared as though there were political problems.

Legislatively we are failing to address problems in  this  particular  area,
and the Constitution before us does not empower  us  to  intervene  at  that
level.  We  were  just  able  to  intervene  administratively,  appoint   an
administrator, etc. But the Council could not do certain things  which  were
supposed to be done by that particular council. So we  just  had  to  leave,
and say that there was nothing we could do.

In  consultation  with  the  standing  committee  in  my  province,  and  in
consultation with the ANC, we then agreed that  the  legislation  before  us
today is correct. Nobody who is politically mature can  disagree  with  what
is before us.
Mr Lever is my friend and colleague. I must tell you that he drove  me  from
Mafikeng to Taung and we had a nice chat. I  warned  him,  and  said:  ``You
know, Mr Lever,  I  don't  like  instant  coffee-creamer  politics.  What  I
suggest we as the  ANC  should  do  for  you,  is  to  prepare  a  political
incubation programme, put you in it and prepare  you.''  He  did  not  agree
with me. Even today he  still  continues  with  his  instant  coffee-creamer
politics. But we will address that. We are from the same province.  We  will
address that problem.

I don't want to spoil what the chairperson, the Minister and other  speakers
have said about this legislation. The  ANC  is  in  support.  I  thank  you.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,
Madam Chair, and thank you to all the members for their input.

The hon Mokoena's  input  demonstrated  that  apparently  simple  governance
processes   can   suddenly   become    extremely    complex.    Complexities
notwithstanding, however,  the  province's  new  name  resonates.  It  feels
right, it sounds right, and the provincial  representatives  in  this  House
seem thoroughly pleased with the outcome  of  the  provincial  name-changing
process. Limpopo it is, and now it shall surely stay.

I am interested, from a language point of view, that we in  the  Free  State
refer to it as ``Limpopo'', and I noticed the representative  here  referred
to it as ``Limpompo''. I will take guidance from you. Just like Mr Lever,  I
am language impaired. I wondered: I find in Sesotho that the ``l'' is  often
pronounced as a ``d''. So you will excuse us if sometimes the  Free  Staters
come up with something like ``Dimpopo'' ... [Laughter.]  ...  while  we  are
trying to learn and become familiar with the many nuances of language.

The hon Lubidla referred to the  dynamic  relations  between  the  tiers  of
government. This amendment has, in my opinion, just the  correct  amount  of
what I like to call the ``push-me, pull-you'' ingredient to give balance  to
these intertier relations.

Hon Lever's input was thoughtful, but it fails to  recognise  the  need  for
provinces and national Government to support capacity-building and  delivery
in local government. He himself referred to the lack  of  capacity  and  the
challenges for delivery, and I think  that  this  input  provides  just  the
correct measures that are required.

When I first heard  Councillor  Johnson's  input  I  thought  ``how  nice'',
because I knew  the  relationship  between  Salga  and  the  NCOP,  and  how
wonderful of our system that a local government body can  participate  here,
and participate in the National Assembly process.  Well,  then  I  heard  Mr
Ackermann's response. Councillor Johnson was being tapped on the  wrist  for
not engaging the NCOP committee.

I know how ferocious our MPs can  be  so  I  will  read  something  on  your
requirement for additional  legislation.  This  is  a  resolution  that  was
adopted by the portfolio committee in the National Assembly. But this  is  a
section of it and it refers to legislation. It says:


  The committee has for purposes of consistency with section 139(3) decided
  not to amend section 100(3), so as to make the enactment of the  national
  legislation  contemplated  in  that  section  compulsory.  However,   the
  committee would like  to  recommend  that  the  Minister  of  Finance  be
  requested to submit a report to the National Assembly within three months
  of the adoption of this report by the National Assembly -


  (a) including or indicating all steps that he has taken or will be taking
       in order to table the national legislation  contemplated  in  section
       100(3), or,  if  he  does  not  envisage  tabling  such  legislation,
       providing motivation for this decision.

So there you have a decision by the portfolio committee that is  leading  to
the place where I think you were going. Let me just say  that  while  you've
learnt to interact with both Houses of Parliament,  it  would  be  wise  and
diplomatic to show your preference for the NCOP. [Laughter.]

The hon member Ratshitanga's delight and pride  at  his  altered  provincial
designation was clearly evident. His reference to ancient  civilisations  in
that province were thought-provoking and profound. I have a sense - we  went
through this with the coat of arms process - that there is so much rich  and
diverse history that we have to learn about our country.

And  so,  in  hon  Ackermann's  words,  this  is  a  celebration.  It  is  a
rediscovery and a redefinition of us as a society, and particularly of  that
province. Mr Ackermann was in a  very  benevolent  mood,  so  it's  easy  to
close.

I thank all the members for their input, and for their preparation for  this
debate. I am firmly of the  belief  that  it  will  provide  a  really  good
mechanism to the kind of problems  that  have  been  addressed.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

IN FAVOUR OF: Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal,  Mpumalanga,
Northern Cape, Northern Province, North West, Western Cape.

Bill  accordingly  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section   65   of   the
Constitution.

                               EXPLOSIVES BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Security and
                       Constitutional Affairs thereon)

The MINISTER OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you,  Madam  Chair  and  hon
members. Over lunch I was thinking about how I would approach my  task  this
afternoon of placing this Bill before this hon House. In my other  life,  as
some of you would know, I was a recorder of history. I was wondering  how  I
would define the atmosphere in this House today, as we begin  to  deal  with
this Bill.

I had to pose that question because as we are sitting here, there  are  very
huge volumes of explosives that are exploding in some parts  of  the  world.
As we are speaking, the children of Iraq are victims  of  these  explosives.
But the issue of Iraq is not an isolated incident. If  it  was  an  isolated
incident, we would say that maybe the world is beginning to understand  that
the human soul is important and we would move away from the many  programmes
that seek to destroy the human soul. But there are other areas  where  these
explosives are being detonated and they are killing human beings.

I was wondering what kind of atmosphere would permeate  this  discussion.  I
was wondering whether  there  would  be  a  sense  of  eeriness  that  would
confront us? Would it be a sense of commitment to ensuring  the  safety  and
security of all people?  Would  it  be  dismembered  attention  to  what  is
happening elsewhere in the world in regard to explosives? Or  would  we  sit
down here and say it is indeed the responsibility  of  South  Africans  who,
coming from our particular background, would want to  negotiate  peace,  not
only in our country, but everywhere where human beings are in conflict  with
one another.

And I came to the conclusion that because we have  this  particular  history
and experience in South Africa, all of us would want to say  that  as  South
Africans, we would want to assist people in areas of the world  where  there
is still  conflict,  to  sit  down  and  negotiate,  through  a  process  of
discussion, those areas of conflict that we have. Therefore,  I  do  believe
that when we look at this particular Bill, we  will  understand  the  injury
that explosives do to human beings and the human soul.

But let me start from the beginning,  with  the  fact  that  our  democratic
breakthrough has seen a systematic process unfolding in our  department,  to
ensure that the legal framework which serves as a tool for  law  enforcement
and to exercise the constitutional mandate  of  the  SA  Police  Service  is
continuously being reviewed and updated to suit present-day circumstances.

The Explosives Act of 1956 is one  of  the  archaic  pieces  of  legislation
which urgently needed such review. Even while we  were  in  the  process  of
adopting this Bill, we were faced with the news of terrible bomb  explosions
in Bali, Tanzania and also at home. It happened in Soweto last year,  events
which are stark reminders of the need to continue  to  improve  measures  to
control explosives.

Modern technology, globalisation, the  increased  use  and  availability  of
fireworks, inadequate penalty provisions and the  concerns  surrounding  the
possession and use of explosives by persons or groups with sinister  motives
also necessitated the review of the Explosives Act of 1956.  Our  Government
has the responsibility to protect its people, and this  it  will  do  within
the framework of effective and ever-improving laws.

The main objective of  the  Bill  before  this  House  today  is  to  ensure
adequate control over the possession and manufacture of  explosives  through
the introduction of severe penalty provisions for offences.

This Bill, together with the Fire Arms Control Act  and  the  Anti-terrorism
Bill that was introduced in Parliament recently, are building blocks in  the
legislative toolbox needed to create a safe and secure environment.  In  the
review and update of the Explosives Act of 1956, a number  of  factors  were
taken into account, including the following.

Firstly, the threat of international terrorism demands better  and  stricter
control over explosives. The  recent  tragic  events  globally  are  clearly
indicative of this need and the threat that explosives pose to all.

Secondly, incidents where explosions  occur  deliberately  or  inadvertently
are simply too frequent. The loss of life and large-scale destruction  in  a
residential area in Pretoria - I am sure you will remember that  incident  -
which resulted from an explosion in  a  house  where  explosives  were  kept
illegally,  and  the  more  recent  suicide  effected  through  the  use  of
explosives, to mention just  a  couple,  are  indicative  of  the  need  for
improved control over explosives, including the licensing of users.

Thirdly, the need to create a database of explosives that  are  manufactured
in or exported from the Republic, or imported into the Republic,  is  urgent
to  enhance  investigations  of  criminal  explosions  and  to   bring   the
perpetrators to book.

Furthermore,  the  Bill  places  a  duty  on  persons  to  keep  records  of
explosives, and to report lost and stolen explosives, and provides  for  the
use of end-user certificates to ensure  that  exported  explosives  are  not
diverted into the hands of criminals. It introduces the  investigative  tool
of presumption of possession of explosives in  circumstances  that  make  it
difficult to link, with reasonable certainty, the possession  of  explosives
to any person. The Bill empowers  the  police  to  take  prints  and  bodily
samples of suspects for investigative purposes. Whilst these provisions  are
necessary and not without a degree of controversy,  the  Bill  ensures  that
they  comply  with  constitutional  norms  and  that  they   can   withstand
constitutional muster.
The Department of Safety and Security and the  SA  Police  Service  have  an
overarching responsibility to ensure the safety and security of all  members
of the public.  The  Department  of  Labour  bears  the  responsibility  for
explosives within the workplace and the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy
within the mining environment. In this Bill, the  respective  roles  of  the
departments vis-à-vis the Explosives Bill and the Department of  Safety  and
Security are determined by providing for certain  exemptions  which  may  be
given by the Minister of Safety  and  Security  in  respect  of  mining  and
occupational health and safety.

The possession and use  of  fireworks  without  a  permit  has  also  raised
controversy amongst certain sections of  our  community.  The  Bill  clearly
does  not  encroach  upon  the  cultural  or  religious  rights  of  certain
communities.  In  fact,  the  Bill  allows  for   these   under   controlled
conditions, by means of a power to the Minister to make  certain  exemptions
in respect of cultural, religious or  traditional  celebrations.  Therefore,
the Bill strikes a  neat  balance  between  the  broader  interests  of  our
society in general and the interests and practices of certain religious  and
cultural communities.

I am especially indebted to the Select Committee on Security of  this  House
for effecting amendments to the Bill that were extremely important, such  as
an amended definition of the  term  ``explosion''  in  the  Bill,  following
continued consultations with the  industry.  Furthermore,  it  became  clear
that although the Bill provided for the criminalisation  of  the  possession
of incendiary devices, such as petrol  bombs,  in  circumstances  where  the
presumptions in the Bill apply,  there  was  a  lacuna  where  a  person  is
actually found in possession of a petrol bomb.  The  committee  consequently
proposed that this House make such recommendation to the National  Assembly.
These amendments are fully  supported,  as  they  enrich  and  appropriately
round off the Bill. Thank you very much for that.

This process underlined once again the important role that  this  House  has
in the parliamentary processes and the broader task that  we  have  for  the
democratisation of our country.  Accordingly,  I  move  that  this  Bill  be
approved by the House, with the amendments  recommended  by  the  committee.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, it was very  interesting  to  hear  of  one
country accusing Iraq of not  respecting  the  Geneva  Convention.  When  it
suits them, they want people to adhere to certain rules and conventions  but
they give themselves licence to act unilaterally.

The bombing of Planet Hollywood at the V&A Waterfront a few years ago was  a
bitter pill to swallow for all South Africans. The bombing of  a  church  in
Bronkhorstspruit, petrol stations in Soweto and other  strategic  places  by
the Boeremag left all patriotic South Africans  very  angry.  The  pipebombs
used to destroy many houses in  the  Western  Cape  were  not  going  to  be
ignored by our Government. There is no way we can ignore the concern  raised
by the SPCA that fireworks pose a danger to our animals, and even  to  human
beings.

I don't think there is anyone in this House who has forgotten  the  pictures
shown on TV and in some newspapers of people in Angola and Mozambique  whose
limbs had been blown off by unwanted explosives. Just think of  those  homes
which were destroyed by petrol bombs.

As the Minister has rightly said, technology is so advanced these days.  The
Explosives Act of 1956  could  not  deal  effectively  with  some  of  these
worrying activities. In reviewing this Act, some corrective measures had  to
be put in place. The  Explosives  Bill  will  limit  the  excessive  use  of
fireworks. There were people who took advantage of the gaps or  shortcomings
in the previous legislation. The Bill makes it  an  offence  to  manufacture
explosives without  authorisation  by  the  state.  No  person  can  possess
explosives without the necessary authorisation. No person  will  be  allowed
to import or export explosives without a permit. If  you  are  found  to  be
engaged in the above things without a licence or permit, the  punishment  is
severe - for example, between 15 and 25 years imprisonment.  Don't  say  you
haven't been warned!

To deal with people who are  fond  of  cheating,  the  Bill  puts  in  place
monitoring mechanisms. That is why the chief  inspector  of  explosives  and
other inspectors can search, seize, inspect and even enter any  premises  to
investigate compliance with the Bill.

The Bill allows other departments or  groupings  to  be  exempted  from  its
provisions. There was a submission from Armscor, which wanted to fall  under
the same category; that is, it also wanted to  be  exempted.  Unfortunately,
the committee could not accommodate their request  because  any  person  can
apply to the Minister to be exempted if tangible reasons are furnished.  So,
their concerns have been taken care of, for example, in  clause  2(3)(a)  in
Chapter 1.

It was pleasing to note that all parties  in  the  committee  supported  the
Bill. The committee agreed with the new formulation that  will  make  it  an
offence for anyone to be  found  in  possession  of  a  petrol  bomb.  As  a
civilised country, we cannot allow a situation where our country's image  is
tarnished by irresponsible elements  -  hence  these  measures  to  control,
observe, monitor and inspect these explosives.

In life, as in football, you won't go very far unless  you  know  where  the
goalposts are. Don't say you  haven't  been  warned  because  it  is  not  a
mistake to make a mistake, but it is a mistake to repeat the same mistake.

We support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek kan nie anders  nie  as  om  te  begin  deur
hierdie paar woorde op te dra aan so baie mede-Suid-Afrikaners, en ook mede-
Afrikane, wie se lewens deur ontploffings van plofstowwe en bomme  vernietig
is. Baie van hulle is vandag nog vermink  as  gevolg  van  dié  ontploffings
deur landmyne, pypbomme, ens.

Ons kan ook nie anders nie, Voorsitter, as om op  hierdie  dag,  terwyl  ons
oor hierdie wetgewing besin,  weer  eens  opnuut  hulde  te  bring  aan  ons
voormalige leiers en presidente van dié land, Mandela en De Klerk,  wat  ons
land weggelei het van die afgrond van 'n burgeroorlog, waar ons land en  ons
toekoms vernietig sou word deur onder andere  ontploffings.  Ons  moet  weer
hulde bring aan daardie leiers wat ons op dié pad gesit het. Ons moet  nooit
vergeet dat dit deur toegewydheid aan 'n vreedsame oplossing is dat ons  dit
reggekry het nie. Ons kan vandag in ons strate loop en  ons  teaters  besoek
sonder om die hele tyd vir 'n ontploffing te vrees.

Maar dit is ook nodig dat ons  te  alle  tye  waaksaam  moet  wees,  en  die
strukture en wetgewing moet daarstel wat ons veiligheidsmagte en polisie  in
staat sal stel om ons te beveilig teen enige internasionale  terroriste,  of
ander mense wat weer van dié tipe metodes sou wou gebruik maak.

Dit is ook belangrik om te besef dat ons voortdurend ons mense moet  lei  op
'n pad van vrede, 'n pad na 'n vreedsame toekoms, en dat  dit  nie  help  om
die ou gevegte weer oor te baklei nie, maar dat ons moet aanbeweeg,  en  dat
ons die toekoms gesamentlik  moet  ingaan  om  die  vyande  van  armoede  en
misdaad aan te spreek, én om dinge te verbeter om 'n beter lewe vir  al  ons
mense in hierdie land daar te stel.

Die huidige regulering van plofstowwe ingevolge die Wet  op  Plofstowwe  van
1956 is nie meer  toereikend  en  effektief  nie,  as  gevolg  van  verskeie
faktore,  onder  andere  die  ontwikkeling  van  nuwe  plofstowwe,   moderne
tegnologie,   globalisering    en    die    daarmee    gepaardgaande    nuwe
klassifiseringstelsels van die Verenigde Nasies, asook 'n groot  toename  in
die  beskikbaarheid  en  gebruik   van   vuurwerk   en   die   ontoereikende
strafbepalings van die huidige wet.

Die hoofoogmerk van hierdie nuwe wet is dan ook in die eerste plek om  seker
te maak dat daar voldoende beheer is oor die besit, die gebruik, die  invoer
en die uitvoer van hierdie plofstowwe wat  so  lewensgevaarlik  vir  al  ons
mense kan wees. Ons is bly dat die erns van die oortredings  met  plofstowwe
benadruk word in die wetgewing. Dit blyk duidelik uit die maksimum  vonnisse
wat voorgeskryf word, soos in die geval van persone wat skuldig bevind  word
aan die oortreding van die regulasies wat in  die  vooruitsig  gestel  word,
selfs  tot  25  jaar  gevangenisstraf.  Ander  vonnisse  wissel  vir  eerste
oortreders vanaf 15 jaar, vir tweede oortreders vanaf 20 jaar en  vir  derde
oortreders ook 25 jaar. Ons steun dit, want hierdie is  lewensgevaarlike  en
dodelike plofstowwe vir ons mense.

Die verbod op die vervoer van plofstowwe  onder  sekere  omstandighede,  wat
tans vervat is in die Wet op Oproerige Byeenkomste,  word  nou  ook  in  dié
wetsontwerp opgeneem om sodoende die maatreëls ten  opsigte  van  plofstowwe
te konsolideer.

Internasionale neigings met betrekking tot die beheer  van  plofstowwe  vind
vergestalting in hierdie wetsontwerp  om  te  verseker  dat  Suid-Afrika  sy
verpligtinge in hierdie verband kan nakom.

Ek wil afsluit deur  die  hoop  en  die  vertroue  uit  te  spreek  dat  dié
wetgewing een van die boublokke sal wees om 'n veilige en beter toekoms  vir
al ons mense in dié land te verseker. [Applous.] (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I have no choice but to  start  by  dedicating
these few words to so many fellow South Africans, and also fellow  Africans,
whose lives were destroyed by explosions caused  by  explosives  and  bombs.
Many of them are still maimed today as a result of these  explosions  caused
by landmines, pipe bombs, etc.

We also have no choice, Chairperson, on this day  when  we  are  considering
this legislation, once more to pay  tribute  to  our  previous  leaders  and
presidents of this country, Mandela and De Klerk, who  steered  our  country
away from the abyss of civil war, where our country  and  our  future  would
have been destroyed by explosions, among other things.  We  must  again  pay
tribute to those leaders who have put us on this path. We must never  forget
that we have achieved this through a  commitment  to  a  peaceful  solution.
Today we can walk our streets and visit our theatres  without  the  constant
fear of an explosion.

However, it is also necessary for us to be cautious at  all  times,  and  to
create the structures and legislation that will enable our  security  forces
and police to protect us against  any  international  terrorists,  or  other
people who would want to use these types of methods again.

It is also important to realise that we should continually guide our  people
on a path of peace, a path towards a peaceful future, and that it serves  no
purpose once again to engage in old  battles,  but  that  we  have  to  move
forward, and that we should move into the future united in order to  address
the enemies of poverty and crime, and to improve things in order  to  create
a better life for all our people in this country.

The current regulation of explosives in terms of the Explosives Act of  1956
is no longer relevant and effective, due to various factors,  including  the
development of new explosives,  modern  technology,  globalisation  and  the
concomitant new classification systems of the United Nations, as well  as  a
huge increase in the availability and use of fireworks  and  the  inadequate
penal clauses of the current Act.

Consequently, the principal objective of the new Act is, firstly, to  ensure
adequate control over the  possession,  use,  import  and  export  of  these
explosives which could endanger the lives of all our people. We are  pleased
that  the  seriousness  of  offences  that  involve  explosives   is   being
emphasised in the legislation. It is  evident  from  the  maximum  sentences
that are being prescribed, as in the case of persons who  are  found  guilty
of  contravening  the  envisaged  regulations,   even   up   to   25   years
imprisonment. Other sentences vary from 15 years  for  first  offenders,  20
years for second offenders  and  also  25  years  for  third  offenders.  We
support it, because these explosives are life-threatening  and  perilous  to
our people.

The ban on the conveyance of explosives under certain conditions,  currently
entrenched in the Riotous Assemblies Act, has  now  also  been  included  in
this Bill in order to consolidate the measures in respect of explosives.

International trends relating to the  control  of  explosives  are  embodied
within this Bill to ensure that South  Africa  fulfils  its  obligations  in
this regard.

In conclusion,  I  want  to  express  the  hope  and  confidence  that  this
legislation will be one of the building blocks which will ensure a safe  and
better future for all our people in this country. [Applause.]]

Mntw   B   Z   ZULU:   Sihlalo,   Ngqongqoshe   ohloniphekileyo    namalungu
ahloniphekileyo,  uma  umuntu  ekhuluma  ngeziqhumane  ezikhathini  eziningi
usuke ekhuluma ngokufa okungekho-ke noyedwa ongumngani wakho kule Ndlu.

Kubaluleke kakhulu ukuba khona kwalo Mthetho  weziQhumane  ukuze  kuvikeleke
labo abazisebenzisayo kanye nomphakathi. Iziqhumane  lezi  ziyingozi  ngisho
nakulabo abazenzayo uma nje kwenzeke iphutha elincane  ekuziphatheni  kwabo.
Yingakho uMnyango wezoBulungiswa nokuThuthukiswa  koMthethosisekelo  ukubone
kubalulekile kakhulu ukuba wenze lesi sichibiyelo salo Mthetho.

Lo Mthethosivivinyo ukubeka kucace  ukuthi  akekho  umuntu  ovumeleke  ukuba
neziqhumane - ukuzithengisa noma  ukuziphatha  ngaphandle  kwemvume.  Akekho
umuntu  ovumelekile   ukwenza   noma   ukugcina   iziqhumane,   ukuzithumela
ngaphandle kwezwe noma ukuzingenisa ezweni ngaphandle  kokuba  abe  nencwadi
yemvume yokwenza njalo. Lo Mthethosivivinyo ukugcizelela kakhulu kuzo  zonke
izigatshana zawo ukuthi ngumuntu onjani okumele anikezwe  igunya  lokuphatha
nokuthengisa iziqhumane.

Ukuqhuma  kweziqhumane  kuyawuhlukumeza   kakhulu   umqondo   walowo   muntu
okuzwayo. Ngisho izilwane ezifana nezinja ziyabaleka ziwashiye amakhaya  azo
uma zizwa umsindo weziqhumane ohlasimulisayo.

Sizibonile   iziqhumane   zibhidliza   izakhiwo,    ngemizuzwana    emibalwa
zishabalale  ziphele.  Uma  ingane  ibe  neshwa   yabona   kuhlaselwa   kubo
ngesiqhumane,  umqondo  wayo  uyahlukumezeka  kakhulu.  Kwesinye   isikhathi
ingane iyabaleka ilishiye  lelo  khaya  ngokubona  ukuthi  ayiphephile  kulo
lapho ibona lidlavuzwa yiziqhumane, libhidlika liphela.

Sizibonile  iziqhumane   zisetshenziswa   ngabantu   basePalestine   abasuke
sebehlukumezeke kakhulu beziqhumisa ngazo ukuze bafe  nezitha  zabo  ezingi.
Namuhla siyalubona ulaka  olubhodla  amalangabi  omlilo  lwempi  yeziqhumane
elwayo e-Iraq. Umonakalo eziwenzayo uyothatha iminyaka ukuba ulungiswe.

Uma uhambela  amazwe  amaningi  ase-Afrika  ayelwa  nalwo  asalwayo,  uthola
abantu  abaningi  kuwo  benqamuke  imilenze  nezingalo  ngenxa   yeziqhumane
okwakuliwa ngazo. Nangemuva kwezimpi  iziqhumane  zisala  ziyingozi  enkulu,
lezo ezisuke zimbelwe phansi, ngoba ziyaqhubeka nokulimaza abantu.

Lapha eMozambique kade sibona ochwepheshe  abanolwazi  lweziqhumane  behamba
becwaninga  iziqhumane   ezazimbelwe   phansi   ukuze   bazithene   amandla.
EMozambique iziqhumane  zihlale  zaba  yingozi  kubo  nangaphezu  kweminyaka
engaphezu kwamashumi amabili nesithupha  izwe  labo  lakhululeka.  Ngakho-ke
kubalulekile kakhulu ukuba uhulumeni wentando yabantu  ahlinzeke  ngomthetho
ofana  nalo  ukuze   ukuphathwa   nokusetshenziswa   kweziqhumane   kwenzeke
ngaphansi kwesandla esiqinileyo. Lokhu kwenzelwa ukuvikela izimpilo  zabantu
abayizakhamuzi   zaseMzansi   Afrika.   Thina   njenge-ANC   siyaweseka   lo
Mthethosivivinyo. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Prince B Z Zulu: Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  when  one
speaks of explosives, more often than not one speaks of death, which  is  no
friend of anyone in this House.

It is imperative that the legislation on  explosives  is  there  to  protect
those who use  them  and  the  community  at  large.  These  explosives  are
hazardous even to those who produce them, if by some mistake something  goes
wrong  in  handling  them.  That  is  why  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development saw fit to amend this Bill.

This Bill states explicitly that no one is allowed  to  have  explosives  in
their possession - to sell or possess them without  permission.  No  one  is
allowed to produce or keep explosives, to export or import  them  without  a
document authorising that particular person to do that. This  Bill  strongly
emphasises in all its clauses what  kind  of  person  should  be  given  the
authority to handle and sell explosives.

The explosion of explosives traumatises the mind of  the  particular  person
who hears it. Even animals such as dogs run away from home if they hear  the
terrible sound of explosives going off.

We have seen explosives destroying buildings; in  a  few  seconds  buildings
vanished. If a  child  is  unfortunate  and  witnesses  his/her  home  being
attacked with explosives, the  child's  mind  is  traumatised.  Sometimes  a
child runs away from home because s/he feels unsafe when s/he sees it  being
destroyed by explosives.

We have witnessed explosives being used by  the  people  of  Palestine,  who
have been very traumatised, to blow themselves up so  that  they  could  die
together with their enemies. Today we  see  a  horrible,  explosive  war  in
Iraq. The damage they cause will take years to rectify.

If you go to many of the African countries that have been  in  conflict  and
those who are still  in  conflict,  you  will  find  many  people  in  those
countries with broken legs and arms because of  the  explosives  which  they
used. Even after wars explosives remain hazardous;  those  that  are  buried
underground, because they continue to hurt people.

In  Mozambique  we  have  seen  explosives  experts  going  around  studying
explosives that were buried underground so they could  deactivate  them.  In
Mozambique explosives remained hazardous to the people for twenty-six  years
after their country became independent. It is therefore important  that  the
democratic Government provides an Act like this so  that  the  handling  and
usage of explosives could take place under strong supervision. This is  done
to protect people's lives, those who are citizens of  South  Africa.  We  as
the ANC support this Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena,  hon  Matthee
and hon Prince Zulu have dealt with most of the aspects of this Bill.  I  am
not going to repeat those aspects, but I am just going to  highlight  a  few
issues that have not yet been highlighted.

I wish to say that the Bill enjoyed the  thorough  process  of  consultation
and negotiation in the National  Assembly.  It  appears  that  most  of  the
problematic aspects of the Bill were adequately dealt with in the  portfolio
committee. The few outstanding issues that remained  were  thoroughly  dealt
with in the select committee, and both  the  hon  Minister  and  hon  Kgoshi
Mokoena have already alluded to those aspects.

The definition of ``explosives'' includes pyrotechnics  and  fireworks,  but
sufficient  provision  has  been  made  for  the  film  industry,  organised
fireworks displays and the use of fireworks for  traditional  and  religious
purposes, as the hon Minister has already alluded to.

The only aspect of the Bill that  creates  some  concern  is  the  issue  of
presumptions. One always has to be  careful  of  writing  presumptions  into
legislation. The select committee was  very  careful  with  the  wording  of
these presumptions, and I believe that everyone in the select  committee  is
now satisfied that the wording of these presumptions is both  constitutional
and lawful.

Accordingly, the Democratic Alliance supports this Bill.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you very much, Chairperson. With my  name  appearing
at the bottom of the list, I now have to resist  the  temptation  to  repeat
what has already been said on this Bill.

Sober deliberations and consultations enabled  us  to  overcome  what  would
have been insurmountable problems when we were dealing  with  this  Bill.  I
can recall that the chairperson  had  to  stop  the  committee  meeting  for
consultations. I think it is to our credit that we dealt with  that  impasse
so effectively.

The question was: How do we deal with explosive situations in  dealing  with
this Bill, with the explosions in other parts of the country at the back  of
our minds? Again, sober deliberations enabled us to overcome that as well.

When we were dealing with the issue  of  fireworks  used  for  entertainment
purposes, again it happened that  on  that  Monday  a  front-page  newspaper
report showed a child with half  an  arm  amputated  due  to  fireworks.  We
deliberated and said that we could not  overlegislate.  Our  democracy  will
rely more on voluntary compliance with legislation by the populace  than  on
draconian legislation that will do nobody any good.

A further point is that when we pass this piece of legislation it  will  add
value to the protocol, in that it will be  recognised  internationally  that
South Africa is  contributing  to  the  control  of  explosives,  which  are
sometimes misused by countries, as we are witnessing right now.

We therefore approve this legislation. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  I  was  intrigued  by  the  hon  Mkhaliphi's
reference to ``sober  consideration'',  and  wonder  what  occurs  in  other
committees. [Laughter.]

Mof J L KGOALI: Modulasetulo, ha nke ke lebohe monyetla ona.  Ha  Letona  la
rona le kgabane le ne le qala le aletsa puo ya lona ka ha Molao  ona  oo  re
tlileng  ho  o  fetisa  tsatsing  lena,  o  ile  a  nkama  maikutlo  haholo.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[Ms J L KGOALI: Chairperson, I thank you for this opportunity. When our  hon
Minister started with his speech, about this legislation that we  are  going
to pass here today, I was really touched.]

When you look at the faces of small children in Iraq, the question comes  to
mind ...

... hore na ekaba ha e ne e le ba ka bana, ho ne ho tla etsahala  eng?  [...
that if those children were mine, what would happen then?]

When you look at  what  is  happening  in  Israel  and  Palestine,  you  ask
yourself: What is happening in this world? Do some people think  that  South
Africa is still the  country  that  it  was  before,  that  they  can  still
practise what they used to do, by bombing  Gauteng  and  the  Western  Cape?
What was in their minds?

The ANC-led Government is happy to support this Bill. We are saying  to  the
nation that we are concerned and we want to see our people living in a  free
society and a happy environment. Therefore, the ANC supports  this  Bill.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, hon Chairperson. I like  the
definition of ``explosives'' the hon Prince Zulu gave. He said  ``explosives
mean death''. That is exactly what  it  is.  I  was  also  reminded  by  the
contributions of many hon members of what  some  of  us  have  seen  in  the
context of our other lives.

The first time I walked on the beach in Luanda, I saw  a  number  of  people
who were coming from a nearby hospital that treated victims of the war  that
went on for many years in Angola. Limbs had been blown  off,  and  ears  and
noses had been cut off.  A  similar  situation,  of  course,  had  been  the
experience of the people of Mozambique. When you see  that  kind  of  sight,
indeed, you want to say how it would have been  better  if  people  had  sat
down to discuss the future of their countries.

The SA  Police  Service,  as  we  speak,  is  involved  in  a  programme  in
Mozambique called Operation Rachel, where we are helping the Mozambicans  to
remove all illegal weapons from their country, but particularly  explosives.
We are helping to demine that country. We are  destroying  bombs  that  they
used and shells of various kinds that were used during that war.

I want to say I am happy that Mr Lever raised the issue of  the  negotiation
process that  happened  around  this  particular  Bill.  It  is  indeed  the
intention of our Government that, under all circumstances, in order  for  us
to move forward, we need to interact with all stakeholders. This is what  we
are doing. We are under that instruction from our leadership  in  Government
- that we must negotiate all the time, to  reach  constructive  outcomes  in
terms of the work that we do as part of our democratisation process.

I also want to say that, as we do that,  what  the  hon  Mkhaliphi  said  is
correct. In the end it will not be the laws that we enact, it  will  not  be
the legal systems and frameworks that we  put  in  place  that  will  ensure
that, indeed, democracy grows. It will be, as he said, voluntary  compliance
on the part of our people. We would also want  to  rely  on  that  voluntary
compliance for this particular legislation to be effective on the ground.

I want to end by picking up on what the hon Matthee said. Those leaders  who
led us away from conflict to  peace,  are  leaders  whose  names  we  should
honour all the time, because they  saved  us  from  a  situation  where  our
country would have experienced an orgy of violence. They took us  away  from
that path to a path where our vision now is one of peace  and  stability  in
South Africa. We should not  forget  that  historic  moment  when  this  was
achieved, because if we do, we will not understand our obligation to  defend
this democracy. It will help us  as  a  springboard  as  we  move  into  the
future, when we remember that sacrifices were made. At the moment when  wise
leadership was required, it was given.

You will remember how precariously our effort was poised  in  the  aftermath
of the assassination of that hero  of  our  people,  Chris  Hani.  You  will
remember how our leadership stood up and  said  that,  while  we  understand
your hurt and your natural desire for vengeance, this is not how  we  should
be moving forward. This is  part  and  parcel  of  the  sacrifices  we  have
already made, and that we will continue  to  make  in  the  name  of  peace,
purely because we understood, when that moment arrived, that  peace  in  our
land was more important than even our own lives. That is why we were at  the
ready to lay down our lives for the purpose of creating the system  and  the
conditions that prevail at this time.

I want to thank you, Madam Chair, and the hon members for the  support  that
this Bill has enjoyed in this House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:04.
