Mr A C NEL: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with  deep  sorrow  and  shock  that  a  former  ANC  member  of
           Parliament, hon Reginald Oliphant, was brutally gunned  down  in
           Mitchell's Plain last Friday;


       (b)  that Uncle Reggie, as he was commonly  known,  was  a  prominent
           civic and UDF activist, the founder of the  Saamstaan  community
           newspaper in Oudtshoorn, the deputy  mayor  of  Oudtshoorn  from
           1995 and subsequently a member of Parliament until 1999; and


       (c)  that he demonstrated a high sense of loyalty and  commitment  to
           the country, its people and the ANC;


  (2) expresses its sincere condolences to the family of the deceased; and


  (3) congratulates the police on acting swiftly and arresting suspects.

Agreed to.

                  THE CHALLENGE TO BUILD A NEW SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Members's Statement)

Nk P N MNANDI  (ANC):  Somlomo,  emcimbini  wesizwe  kufihlwa  iqhawe  ubaba
uWalter  Sisulu  ngempelasonto  le,  lowo  owayekade  engumongameli   wezwe,
uComrade Nelson Mandela, uphawule  ukuthi  kusukela  kule  minyakana  edlule
indlela eya emathuneni iya ivuthwa. Silokhu siya nje siyolahla  isizukulwane
samaqhawe asefike ekugcineni kwenkambo yawo.

La magama yebo ayisikhalo afanele futhi, kepha kolunye uhlangothi  angumbuzo
onzulu obhekiswe  kithi  sonke  lapha  eNdlini  nangaphandle,  nakubo  bonke
abantu  baleli  zwe.  Umbuzo  uthi:   Ngamunye   ngamunye   lapha   kithina,
sikulungele  na  ukuthatha  umkhonto  owe  kuleli  qhawe,  siqhubeke   sakhe
iNingizimu  Afrika  engenabandlululo.  Sizinikele  na  ekwakheni  iNingizimu
Afrika enoxolo, ukuthula nenhlalakahle.

UKhongolose uthi  lapho  umkhonto  kaXhamela  uwe  khona,  thina  singabantu

Afrika  masiqhubeke  sakhe  izwe  elakhelwe   phezu   kwesisekelo   sobuntu.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu member's statement follows.)

[Ms P N MNANDI: Madam Speaker, at the state funeral of  hero  Walter  Sisulu
this weekend, the former President of the Republic, Comrade Nelson  Mandela,
remarked that a few years ago we started burying more people. Every now  and
then we visit the graveyard to lay to rest a generation of heroes  who  have
reached the end of their journey.

These are words of grief which are justified, but on the  other  hand,  they
pose a deep question to all of us in the House, to those outside it  and  to
all the people of this country. The question is: Is each one of us ready  to
take over the sword from the fallen hero and continue the task  of  building
a peaceful and caring South Africa.

The ANC's message is that we must pick up Mr Sisulu's sword from  the  point
where it fell and  continue  with  the  struggle  against  poverty.  Let  us
continue loving our country and all our people. As people of  this  country,
let us take forward the struggle to build our country on the  foundation  of
respect for human rights and for the rights of women and  children.  As  the
people of South Africa, let us go on building a country  that  is  based  on
the foundation of ubuntu.]

The SPEAKER: I  would  remind  members  that  you  must  please  limit  your
statements to the time allocated. I do not like  interrupting  you  in  your
statements, but it has now become a habit to just overrun the time.

                      CONGESTION IN SOUTH AFRICAN PORTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr R J HEINE (DA): Madam Speaker, it is now obvious that the  operations  in
our ports have reached crisis levels. The port  congestion  in  Durban,  our
biggest port, is currently averaging from 48 to 72 hours. In Cape Town  port
congestion is averaging about 72 hours for a vessel  to  get  a  berth.  The
Port  Elizabeth  port  is  working,  but  is  severely  hampered   by   poor
productivity and occasional congestion as a  result  of  the  congestion  in
Cape Town and Durban.

The present port congestion has resulted in the  shipping  lines  having  no
option but to impose a port-congestion  surcharge  of  US$100  per  20  food
containers, which is payable by the importer or the exporter. Our  exporters
are already feeling the negative financial impact which is also  made  worse
as a result of the strengthening rand.

The crux of the matter is  that  poor  productivity  is  mainly  due  to  an
alarming lack of infrastructure in the South African  ports.  To  complicate
the  matter  further  is  the  threatening  strikes  by  unions   over   the
concessions at Durban port. Any such strike action  would  be  nothing  less
than sabotaging the whole economy.

The Minister of Labour is quick to threaten  employers  over  minimum  wages
and unemployment insurance levies, but  he  keeps  a  deathly  silence  when
labour embarks on actions crippling our economy. The DA  urgently  calls  on
Minister Radebe to solve this crisis. Exports and imports are the  heartbeat
of our economy and this situation cannot be allowed to carry on for one  day
longer. [Applause.]

                       DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N S MIDDLETON (IFP): Madam Speaker, the ILO  has  recently  released  its
first global report on discrimination in the workplace.  According  to  this
report, blatant types of  discrimination  were  reported.  However,  subtle,
less visible and more insidious forms of discrimination have  emerged.  Much
as most countries were dealing with discrimination  in  the  workplace,  not
one has been found  to  be  free  of  these  other  less  visible  forms  of
discrimination. These new forms of  discrimination  include,  among  others,
HIV/Aids, disability, religion, sexual orientation and age.

The Department of Labour must be applauded for addressing  the  problems  of
inequality in the workplace that were perpetrated  by  the  previous  regime
through its labour laws and the Employment Equity Act.

The Labour Relations  Act,  however,  must  be  attended  to.  Although  our
Government has done so much to address the problems  of  discrimination,  we
are  faced  with  a  new  challenge  of  addressing  these  new   forms   of
discrimination which have been identified  by  the  ILO.  According  to  the
report, our country is not immune from the problems of discrimination.

Some discriminated workers are put under so much pressure by  their  hostile
employers, and sometimes coworkers, that they are compelled to resign.  With
more  people  infected  by  HIV/Aids,  especially  the  economically  active
population, there is a need for vigilant education on  the  disease  and  on
how those living with the virus  have  to  be  treated,  especially  in  the
workplace.

                        CRICKET DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms  N  R  NTSHULANA-BHENGU  (ANC):  The  KwaZulu-Natal  Cricket  Board   was
privileged to witness the launch of the school cricket  development  project
initiated with the assistance of the Lottery  Fund  in  Pietermaritzburg  on
the 11 March 2003.

This cricket development programme  which  was  launched  in  Willowton  and
Sweet Waters stands to  benefit  15  schools  in  these  areas.  Sixty-three
teachers have been trained in basic cricket as a result of  this  programme.
We in the ANC therefore rise to commend the KwaZulu-Natal Cricket Board  and
the UCB for launching this initiative in an otherwise rural environment.

The project is testimony to the fact that cricket  can  be  played  and  can
grow even in areas  that  are  outside  the  urban  section.  We  view  this
initiative as a contribution  to  the  Government's  integrated  sustainable
rural development strategy. We wish to urge that schools  involved  in  this
programme should be supported with the necessary resources and facilities.

We, therefore, call on the other UCB affiliates to emulate the  example  set
by the KwaZulu-Natal Cricket board by taking the game to the rural areas  of
our country. In light of this development, we hope  that  the  Minister  and
his department will continue to make progress in  developing  sport  in  the
rural communities and wish that the Minister  shares  with  this  House  the
successes and challenges of his efforts. I thank you. [Applause.]

                                  BOEREMAG

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr J SCHIPPERS (NNP): Mevrou die Speaker, organisasies  soos  die  Boeremag
en die Swart Hand  is  'n  verleentheid  vir  die  meerderheid  witmense  in
hierdie land. Al is  hierdie  rassistiese  groepies  klein,  hou  hulle  die
gevaar in om Suid-Afrikaners te verdeel, en dit lei tot  verdere  wedersydse
wantroue.

Hierdie verskynsel hou definitiewe gevare in vir ons jong demokrasie en  kan
onder geen omstandighede geringgeskat word nie, veral omdat dit  jong  mense
is wat betrokke is. Dit is 'n sweer wat onmiddellik behandel moet  word,  en
nie geïgnoreer kan word nie, want dit kan die hele land besmet.

Politici help nie deur in taktiek vou swart gevaar te  verkondig  nie.  Jong
Suid-Afrikaners moet hulle ook nie laat  uitbuit  deur  politici  wat  hulle
opsweep en later hul hande in onskuld was nie. Jong  Boeremaglede  word  nou
verhoor vir onder meer hoogverraad. In Stellenbosch  hou  'n  klein  groepie
rassiste 'n hele kampus gyselaar.

Die NNP doen 'n beroep op  elkeen  wat  weet  wie  die  Swart  Hand  is,  om
onmiddellik na vore te kom met inligting. Dit is  in  die  belang  van  elke
Suid-Afrikaner  om  te  help  om  'n  beter  toekoms  te  bou.  Ek  dank  u.
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS (NNP): Speaker, organisations  like  the  Boeremag  and  the
Swart Hand are an  embarrassment  to  most  of  the  white  people  in  this
country. Though these racist groups  are  small,  they  are  threatening  to
divide South Africans, and this will cause further mutual distrust.

This phenomenon poses definite dangers  to  our  young  democracy,  and  can
under no circumstances be underestimated, particularly  since  it  is  young
people  who  are  involved.  It  is  an  abscess  that  should  be   treated
immediately and  cannot  be  ignored,  because  it  can  infect  the  entire
country.

Politicians do not help by advocating ``swart gevaar'' tactics. Young  South
Africans should also not allow themselves to  be  exploited  by  politicians
who incite them and then later wash their hands in innocence. Young  members
of the Boeremag are currently  on  trial  for  high  treason  amongst  other
things. In Stellenbosch a small  group  of  racists  is  holding  an  entire
campus hostage.
The NNP is calling on anyone who knows who the Swart Hand is immediately  to
come forward with information. It is in the interest of every South  African
to assist in building a better future. I thank you.]

                                   BURUNDI

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A BLAAS (NNP): Mevrou die  Speaker,  die  vredesproses  in  die  DRK  en
Burundi is besig om buite beheer te raak en  om  in  'n  tweede  Viëtnam  te
ontaard.  Mense  word  by  hul  honderde  vermoor.  By  monde  van  'n   VN-
woordvoerder, moet meer troepe beskikbaar  gemaak  en  sal  vrede  afgedwing
moet word.

Dit is duidelik  dat  die  faksies  in  die  DRK  nie  verbind  is  tot  die
vredesproses nie, terwyl meer en meer hulp en  geld  van  ander  lande,  met
inbegrip van Suid-Afrika, in hierdie bodemlose  put  gegooi  moet  word.  Te
midde hiervan, sê die  agb  President  van  Suid-Afrika  dat  die  Verenigde
Nasies hom ook moet versterk en hom tog moet onttrek sodat  die  Afrika-unie
die proses kan oorneem. As ek dit dalk  net  kan  noem  dat  dit  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse belastingbetaler tans tot selfs as R200 miljoen uit die  sak  kan
jaag, word geraam dat die laasgenoemde optrede die Suid-Afrikaanse  Regering
tot selfs R600 miljoen kan kos.

Hoewel vrede in Afrika wenslik is, kan Suid-Afrika, met sy  eie  pakket  van
noodsaaklikhede, nie sulke optredes bekostig  nie.  Die  primêre  fokus  van
Suid-Afrika is nie die DRK of Burundi nie. Vrede is  nie  haalbaar  as  daar
nie 'n wil tot vrede is nie. Suid-Afrika moet sy betrokkenheid by dié  lande
verminder, en nie verder by die onbekostigbare  en  nimmereindigende  proses
betrokke raak nie. Dankie. [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's
statement follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS (NNP): Speaker, the peace process and the  DRC  and  Burundi  is
getting out of control and deteriorating into a second Vietnam.  People  are
being murdered in their hundreds. A UN spokesperson said more troops  should
be made available, and peace will have to be enforced.

It is evident that the factions in the DRC are not committed  to  the  peace
process, while more  and  more  support  and  money  from  other  countries,
including South Africa, have to be poured into this bottomless pit.  In  the
midst of this the hon President of South Africa is saying  that  the  United
Nations must also strengthen him  and  nevertheless  withdraw  so  that  the
African Union can take over the process. If I may perhaps just mention  that
as this can currently cost the South  African  ratepayer  as  much  as  R200
million, it is estimated  that  the  latter  action  could  cost  the  South
African Government as much as R600 million.

Though peace in Africa is desirable, South Africa,  with  its  own  list  of
priorities, cannot afford such actions. The primary focus  of  South  Africa
is not the DRC or Burundi. Peace is unattainable unless there is a will  for
peace. South Africa should reduce its involvement in  these  countries,  and
should not get  further  involved  in  this  unaffordable  and  never-ending
process. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                               COMMUNICATIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N S MTSWENI (ANC): May 17 was the World Telecommunications Day whose  aim
is to help all of the world's people to communicate. This still serves as  a
reminder to all of us of the critical role of communication in all areas  of
human endeavour.

It endorses the United Nations Millennium Summit of 2003 in helping  all  of
the world's people to communicate. Millions of  people  especially  in  poor
cultures are still excluded from enjoying this right. Communication  is  the
basis of all human  kinds'  success.  Information  has  remained  as  a  key
element of the economic prosperity.

However, the detailed debate between the developed and developing  countries
continues to hinder the promise of greater prosperity  and  equality.  Those
who do not have access to information and communication technology  are  not
able to share in the social economic benefits.

As the world prepares itself for the first phase of  this  World  Summit  on
the Information Society to be held in Geneva from the  10-12  December,  the
African National Congress urges all  stakeholders,  governments,  businesses
and societies to work tirelessly to narrow the ? divide in an effort to  lay
the foundation of a truly inclusive  globally  committed  society  and  push
back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]
                   INTERNATIONAL CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL DAY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr  A  N  LUTHULI  (ANC):  Madame  Speaker,   the   world   celebrated   the
International Candlelight Memorial Day on 18 May  2003.  As  part  of  these
celebrations, candlelight memorial services were held in all  parts  of  the
country yesterday under the auspices of the ANC Government.

These services were held in memory of  all  South  Africans  who  passed  on
because of HIV/Aids-related illnesses. These services were also  a  reminder
of the huge challenge of turning the tide against HIV/Aids, which all  South
Africans must confront.

Although awareness about HIV/Aids  has  increased  amongst  our  people  the
pandemic is still spreading at an  alarming  rate,  especially  amongst  our
youth. There is no cure for AIDS. We thus have to  make  efforts  to  ensure
that the disease does not spread. It thus becomes  important  that  we  heed
the Government's call for Abstinence, Be  faithful  or  Condomise,  ABC.  We
believe that if we heed to this call we will  successfully  win  the  battle
against HIV/Aids.
The best way to remember those who died of this disease is to carry  forward
the battle to fight the scourge of HIV/Aids. Let us all join the  Government
partnership to fight this disease. I thank you.

                 MEMBERS' CONDUCT HARMING PARLIAMENT'S IMAGE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr J P I BLANCHÉ (FA): Mevrou die Speaker, in Beeld van 21 April 2003  bied
die Nuwe Nasionale Party se Adjunk-minister, mnr  Renier  Schoeman,  en  mnr
Daryl Swanepoel onomwonde verskonings aan vir die lasterlike onwaarhede  wat
hulle oor mnr Tony Leon die wêreld ingestuur het. In hierdie  verklaring  in
Beeld erken die Nuwe NP en die twee  agb  lede  dat  die  storie  wat  hulle
versprei het, lasterlik en 'n leuen was.

Nie net hierdie insident het die Parlement  en  politici  se  beeld  geskaad
nie, maar ook die feit dat mev  Winnie  Mandela  en  mnr  Tony  Yengeni  ons
geledere as gevolg van twyfelagtige dade verlaat het, het die  Parlement  se
beeld geskaad.

Omdat ons  reeds  die  elfde  wysiging  van  die  wetsontwerp  op  Magte  en
Voorregte van Lede van die Parlement voor die ad hoc-komitee  het,  en  geen
vordering daarmee toon nie, wil die Federale Alliansie  weet  wat  die  Nuwe
NP/ANC-alliansie met hierdie rolmodelle in sy geledere  gaan  doen,  en  hoe
die Adjunk-president dit versoen met die kerke se versoek dat  die  Regering
moet voorloop in die veldtog vir morele herontwaking.

Agb Speaker, gaan die Regering hierdie Parlement  beskerm?  Gemeet  aan  die
leë banke van die agb ministers daar anderkant, wil ek die  weddenskap  maak
van 1000 teen 1, hul dat nie gaan nie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member’s
statement follows.)

[Mr J P I BLANCHÉ (FA): Thank you, Madam Speaker. Speaker, in the  Beeld  of
21 April 2002 the New National Party's Deputy Minister, Mr Renier  Schoeman,
and Mr Daryl Swanepoel apologised frankly for the  libellous  untruths  that
they had told the world about Mr Tony Leon. In this statement in  the  Beeld
the New National Party and the two hon members admitted that the story  they
had told was libellous and a lie.

Not only did this incident harm Parliament's image,  but  so  did  the  fact
that Mrs Winnie Mandela and Mr Tony Yengeni left our ranks as  a  result  of
dubious deeds.

Because we already have the eleventh amendment of the Powers and  Privileges
of Members of Parliament Act before  the  ad  hoc  committee,  and  are  not
making any progress with it, the Federal Alliance would like  to  know  what
the New National Party/ANC Alliance is going to do with  these  role  models
in its ranks, and how does the Deputy  President  reconcile  this  with  the
churches'  request  that  the  Government  take  the  lead  in   the   moral
regeneration campaign.

Hon Speaker, is the Government going to protect this Parliament? Judging  by
the empty seats of the hon Minister on the other side, I want to make a  bet
of 1000 to 1 that it will not.]

                         JOB LOSSES AND UNEMPLOYMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DP): Madam Speaker, ahead of next month's  job  summit  surveys
confirm the devastating effect of nearly 10 years of ANC  Government  -  one
million jobs lost and unemployment figures topping 40%.

Yet  instead  of  amending  draconian  labour  legislation  and   abolishing
exchange control, both  of  which  will  kickstart  new  job  opportunities,
Government tries to keep awkward topics  like  Gear  and  HIV/Aids  off  the
agenda, while the ANC/NNP-controlled Cape Town  Metropole  intends  racially
reallocating thousands of posts for other population groups, in a  piece  of
social engineering so bizarre that it can only have been dreamed up  on  the
far reaches of Verwoerdian never-never land.

At the lowest unskilled level, where individuals will  find  it  hardest  to
find new  jobs,  1095  black  men  and  3036  coloured  men,  labourers  and
cleaners, must vacate their positions and join the 40%  unemployed  to  make
way for amongst others 956 white men, 854 white women, 812 black  women  and
1224 coloured  women.  The  cost  of  this  huge  restructuring  process  is
unknown, but the municipality has indicated that it will have  to  take  out
loans to cover the expected number of retirement packages.
What is known, Madam Speaker, is that instead of creating jobs  the  ANC  is
losing jobs causing more and more  unskilled  people  to  join  the  growing
ranks of the unemployed. Thank you.

                              CHILD PORNOGRAPHY

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Madam Speaker, the Constitutional Court is  reviewing
a case against a certain film-maker for possessing child pornography.

The Constitutional Court has the task  of  determining  whether  this  man's
right to privacy and freedom  of  expression,  and  possibly  his  right  to
scientific  research,  has  been  infringed  or  not.  The  man  said   such
possession was innocent and would include research  and  film-making.  There
has to be a way to determine innocent possession  for  scientific  research.
This is an unprecedented case in South Africa, and charting the way  forward
in  this  matter  will  help  in  alleviating  child  abuse   and   possibly
eliminating it.

In Britain a man was arrested for similar possession, and he  cited  similar
arguments saying he was doing research in child pornography as part  of  the
campaign to counter child abuse. The British police cautioned the  man  and,
for the fact that he did not download  porn  pictures  but  only  looked  at
them, his name was placed on a British sex offenders' register. This  serves
to confirm the social belief of the Government, the  Films  and  Publication
Board, and the  Directorate  of  Public  Prosecution  that  such  possession
amounts to a tacit and dormant likelihood to inculcate, instill and  provoke
anti-social behaviour leading to possible child abuse.

We hope that the Constitutional Court  will,  after  having  considered  all
arguments, rule against  private  possession  by  the  very  fact  of  being
announced to the Films and Publication Board. Thank you.

                  CONFERENCE ON BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M U KALAKO (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Western Cape  Provincial  Government
is hosting a two-day conference on black economic empowerment.  The  purpose
of this conference is to elaborate a strategy for meaningful black  economic
empowerment in the province.

This conference is attended by big business  and  all  the  role-players  in
black economic empowerment initiatives. The ANC  views  this  conference  as
historic, and that the people of the Western Cape now  have  an  opportunity
for the  first  time  to  influence  government  policy  on  black  economic
empowerment.  This  conference  represents  yet  another  milestone  in  the
commitment of the NNP/ANC co-operation to improve the lives  of  all  people
in the Western Cape.

This conference is  part  of  the  overall  transformatory  process  of  the
NNP/ANC-led provincial government of the Western  Cape  to  build  a  better
life for all people. The ANC welcomes all delegates to this conference,  and
wishes them success in their deliberations. Thank you.

           POOR MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF SOUTH AFRICA'S HARBOURS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J J NIEMANN  (NNP):  Agb  Speaker,  swak  bestuur  en  beheer  aan  Suid-
Afrikaanse hawens kos Suid-Afrika jaarliks miljoene  rande.  Daarom  is  dit
uiters noodsaaklik dat die herstrukturering van  Suid-Afrikaanse  hawens  so
gou  moontlik   voltooi   moet   word.   Dit   sal   ekonomiese   groei   en
beleggingsvertroue in die land 'n groot hupstoot gee.

In Durban, Suid-Afrika se bedrywigste hawe, is sowat R2,5 miljard  nodig  om
die terminaal te reorganiseer en te herkapitaliseer. Sedert  1994  was  daar
'n fenominale toename in  invoer  en  uitvoer,  wat  baie  druk  op  al  die
binnelandse terminale plaas. Die volume aan invoer en  uitvoer  oorskry  die
vermoë van die hawens met 26%. Dit veroorsaak noodgedwonge  dat  Suid-Afrika
nie tot sy volle vermoë in- en uitvoer nie.

Uitvoer ervaar soms vertragings van tot 72 uur vandat hulle die  goedere  by
die hawe afgelewer  het  tot  dat  dit  verskeep  word.  Dit  het  natuurlik
ernstige gevolge vir bederfbare produkte. Die NNP glo dit het  nou  'n  saak
van  dringendheid   geword   dat   die   voorgestelde   restrukturering   en
privatisering van sekere terminale afgehandel moet word. Dit sal nie  alleen
die ekonomie goed doen nie, maar ook werk skep.
Die Regering kan eenvoudig nie meer sy voete sleep  met  hierdie  inisiatief
nie. Suid-Afrika kan nie bekostig dat swak bestuur en beheer van  hawens  'n
verlies  aan  inkomste  of  beleggingsvertroue   veroorsaak   nie.   Dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN (NNP): Hon Speaker, poor management  and  control  at  South
African harbours cost South Africa millions of rands annually. Therefore  it
is imperative that the restructuring of South  African  harbours  should  be
completed as soon as possible. It will boost economic  growth  and  investor
confidence in the country.

In Durban, South Africa's busiest harbour,  approximately  R2,5  billion  is
needed for the reorganisation and recapitalisation of  the  terminal.  Since
1994 there has been a phenomenal increase  in  imports  and  exports,  which
places a lot of pressure on all  the  domestic  terminals.  The  volumes  of
imports and exports exceed the capacity of the harbours by 26%.  From  sheer
necessity this results in South Africa's not importing and exporting to  its
full capacity.

Exports are sometimes delayed by up to 72 hours from the  time  of  delivery
until they are shipped.  This,  of  course,  has  serious  consequences  for
perishable products. The NNP believes that  it  has  now  become  matter  of
urgency  that  the  proposed  restructuring  and  privatisation  of  certain
terminals should be completed. This will not only benefit the  economy,  but
will also create job opportunities.

The  Government  simply  cannot  continue  to  drag  its  feet   with   this
initiative. South Africa  cannot  afford  poor  management  and  control  of
harbours resulting in a loss of revenue or investor confidence. Thank you.]

                              SCHOOL GOVERNANCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE (ACDP): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Section  38(a)  of  the
Education Laws Amendment Bill goes against the principles of  affording  the
parents at a school the right  to  have  some  say  over  who  is  employed,
awarded and retained for their respective schools.

The Government is once again showing its undemocratic, draconian  system  to
our schools, which  is  stifling  current  positive  initiatives  by  school
governing bodies to improve access to quality education for all.

Teachers with years of service, and higher levels of  training  and  skills,
will leave Government schools en masse, and the profession of teaching  will
become even  less  attractive  than  it  already  is.  The  ACDP  feels  the
Government is failing to pay good salaries  to  teachers,  in  general,  and
should not prevent governing bodies from trying to rectify the  Government's
inefficiencies by rewarding additional  benefits  to  teachers  who  perform
outstanding work or are highly valued.

The ACDP feels that the Government should be trying to get its act  together
by providing teachers with competitive salaries and  incentives  instead  of
limiting the rights of school governing bodies  to  reward  and  retain  its
good  teachers.  It  is  completely  unacceptable  for  teachers.  The  only
increment they receive  is  that  which  is  made  according  to  inflation,
causing teachers with several years of experience to be  paid  the  same  as
new teachers fresh out of college.

The department should seriously  look  at  its  approach  towards  governing
bodies as it is alienating itself from the  very  people  who  put  them  in
power to represent their concerns. Thank you.

                             TEACHERS' SALARIES

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: The ACDP has entered this  debate  very  late  in
the day. It's too much to expect either the ACDP or the New NP  or  the  DP,
and particularly its leader, to apologise.

I have before me the Employment of Educators Act. We have since  1998,  when
the Act was passed, criminalised teachers. Under this Act - the  hon  Leader
of the Opposition may grin like a Cheshire cat, but the Cheshire  cat  never
won anything - it says here quite clearly that educators  receiving  rewards
in cash or kind to supplement their official salaries from  their  employer,
without the permission of their employer, are  unlawfully  in  contravention
of the Employment of Educators Act regulations. Without the approval of  the
employer, which is the provincial department, any additional reward in  cash
or kind for performing duties is forbidden. What we are trying  to  do,  and
we have total openness to receiving submissions, is to ensure that  teachers
are paid for additional tasks.

Contrary to what the hon member from the  ACDP  has  said,  we  now  have  a
performance management approach where they are  paid  not  only  because  of
seniority  and  in  keeping  with  inflation,  but  we  have  now   divorced
administration from teaching.

Tomorrow I shall address a press conference. I don't expect the DA or  other
footling organisations to apologise, but quite clearly  ...  [Interjections]
... you can bay at wolves. It is illegal for teachers to receive  additional
payments.  [Interjections.]  You  are   supposed   to   support   the   law.
[Interjections.]

Madam Speaker, it is impossible to reach these people. It is illegal to  pay
additional amounts. What we are trying  to  do  now  is  to  regularise  it,
therefore, for additional work.

Tomorrow I shall address this issue. This has not gone  to  the  Council  of
Education Ministers. It has not gone to the Cabinet. We  put  this  out  for
public discussion so that there can  be  sensible  rational  discussion.  We
reject the approach of the ACDP. We have not chosen the employment laws.  We
reject the bafundisi in this matter. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, please take your seat. Order, order!

                      COMMITMENT TO PEACE AND STABILITY

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.  We  who
understand the virtues of peace and the ugliness of  war  will  continue  to
make a  contribution  to  the  establishment  of  conditions  of  peace  and
stability here in South Africa, on  the  continent,  and  in  the  world  at
large.

There is no one who is  going  to  come  to  us  here  and  say  ``Peace  is
expensive.'' We know peace is expensive. We know that in  South  Africa,  in
order for us to build the political atmosphere that exists now,  we  had  to
fight from 1912 until 1994 to attain those  conditions  of  peace.  We  will
continue to do that, be it for the sake of the Barundi, the  people  in  the
DRC, in Angola, or anywhere else on our continent.

We will continue to make an input towards the creation of  these  conditions
of peace and stability. We are not going to listen  to  any  warmongers,  be
they South African or from anywhere else in the world.

We want, at all times, to sustain conditions  that  don't  promote  conflict
and war. [Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 4 - Home Affairs:

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  it  is  a
pleasure for  me  to  introduce  the  debate  on  the  Home  Affairs  Budget
Appropriation for the 2003-04 financial year.

This might be my last budget as Minister of Home Affairs. I  wish  to  state
that in the past nine years I've exercised my functions exclusively  in  the
service of the state and the people  of  South  Africa.  I  thank  President
Mbeki  for  giving  me  that  opportunity.   I   never   allowed   political
considerations to detract from what I had to do. I never used my  office  to
benefit my political party. I have  not  given  jobs  and  positions  to  my
friends, nor have I prevented my foes from achieving  them  when  they  were
qualified.

It seems that media reports use my  department  as  the  flogging  horse  of
governmental  service  delivery  inadequacies.  I  do  not  shy  away   from
shortcomings which we are addressing within the  tight  confines  of  scarce
available resources and imposed limitations. However, our  achievements  are
overshadowed by unwarranted adverse publicity and negative  perceptions  all
the time.

Twenty-eight million South Africans bear identity  documents  issued  by  my
department. This affords to all of them rights of  citizenship  and  enables
their access to benefits and activities  in  both  the  public  and  private
sectors. At the end of last  year  there  was  a  databank  of  43  186  445
fingerprints on record in the department, representing the backbone  of  our
identification system. The total South  African  population  represents  the
recurring clients of Home Affairs, as we  register  their  births,  identify
them,  marry  them,  naturalise  them,  change  their  names,  issue  travel
documents to them and record their deaths, and constantly replace  all  such
documents when lost or expired.

In addition, we manage and process all the millions of foreign  visitors  to
our country. Thus, cumulatively speaking, our client base  probably  exceeds
300 million persons and considering the  span  and  scale  of  our  business
operation I commend my officials for their dedication and hard  work.  Quite
often their hard work and sacrifice are overshadowed by actions of those  in
our civil service who are corrupt and who  do  not  serve  the  public  with
diligence, courtesy and dedication. This is, of course,  because  widespread
corruption in the department is often alleged.

Not a single instance of unethical conduct can  be  justified  and  we  have
significantly stepped up our investigation and  prosecution  capacities.  We
are nurturing a mind-set among staff that reflects  the  highest  levels  of
integrity and honesty and we are installing incorruptible systems.  However,
the observation in the recently released  United  Nations-sponsored  Country
Corruption Assessment Report that about  30%  of  our  officials  have  been
approached to perform unlawful activities, is disturbing, to say the least.

We are engaged in systematic efforts to improve service  delivery.  We  were
the first department  to  issue  a  service  delivery  improvement  plan  as
prescribed in the Batho Pele White Paper. We were the  first  department  to
earn the Batho Pele merit award from President Mandela. We  have  introduced
the notion of exemplary offices, which are centres of service excellence  in
all regions, from which our vision of an efficient  and  customer-orientated
new department will be rolled out.

I  have  instructed  a  comprehensive  scientific  investigation  into   the
required  personnel  establishment  and  organisational  structure  of   the
department linked to the current sparseness  of  Home  Affairs  offices  and
service points throughout  the  country.  Final  proposals  regarding  these
matters will be submitted to me by the end of June 2003.

Currently the department has 1 915 vacant posts calculated on the  basis  of
a 1995 outdated and  insufficient  personnel  establishment,  including  358
vacancies at the Government Printing Works. As an  interim  measure  Cabinet
has approved the filling of 349 critical posts during the 2003-04  financial
year and an amount of R20 933 million is included in the current budget  for
this  purpose.  However,  an  additional  amount  of  R67  908  million  was
requested for the filling of 704 further vacant posts during  2003-04.  This
is patchwork based on a 1995 scenario, and the complete current  picture  of
Home Affairs personnel requirements will only emerge on  the  completion  of
the mentioned scientific investigation.

The inadequate reach of our services  into  deeply  rural  and  marginalised
urban  communities   is   also   pertinently   being   addressed   in   this
investigation. The scientific formula employed to determine office  location
and staffing levels in fact contains a built-in bias  towards  these  areas,
compensating in particular for distance  in  sparsely  populated  areas  and
taking into  account,  as  well,  the  availability  or  absence  of  public
transport. The completion of the investigation in five  of  the  10  regions
has shown that in these regions  there  is  a  need  for  six  new  regional
offices, 36  new  district  offices,  26  new  permanent  service  points  -
excluding service points where services are only provided  on  certain  days
or by special request - and more than a doubling of mobile units to 219.

Furthermore, this necessitates a 722-staff increase, from 2  195  to  3  917
and the personnel  costs  alone  of  these  proposals  amount  to  R127  295
million. Still in progress are the  similar  scientific  investigations  for
the remaining five regions as well  as  the  seven  primary  business  units
located in the departmental head office.

The necessity to expand our foreign operation in  the  light  of  escalating
international travel to South Africa places tremendous  additional  pressure
on our already overstressed capacities at ports  of  entry  and  our  twenty
foreign offices. We are just  not  equipped  to  process  the  more  than  8
million foreigners per year who visit  our  country.  Consequently,  it  can
realistically be expected that the eventual requirements will by far  exceed
the doubling of the above.

Without addressing our aforesaid requirements  service  excellence  in  Home
Affairs  will  remain  but  an  unfulfilled  dream  and   service   delivery
improvement throughout Government will remain  elusive.  The  financial  and
infrastructural  requirements  of  establishing  a  properly  equipped   and
adequately staffed Department of Home  Affairs  are  massive.  Against  this
background I have construed my strategic vision of  the  devolution  of  the
delivery  interface  of  the  Home  Affairs  civic  services  to  third-tier
authorities. Apart from making financial sense, this option  is  also  fully
aligned with governmental policy on integrated service delivery and  remains
the only financially viable option for the future.

Municipalities and traditional authorities are closest  to  the  people  and
the sensible link between communities and our central records  and  systems.
We have done our internal homework regarding this matter and it needs to  be
pursued at  an  intergovernmental  level  now.  Because  of  the  inevitable
involvement of so many other stakeholders we cannot go it alone. I  urge  my
colleagues,  especially  the   Ministers   of   the   Public   Service   and
Administration and for Provincial and Local Government to support me in  the
developing and roll-out of  this  only  viable  alternative  for  addressing
current unsatisfactory service levels.

The migration branch  is  largely  engaged  in  the  implementation  of  the
Immigration Act of 2002 and the immigration regulations  made  in  terms  of
such Act and relating to the management  of  critical  immigration  matters.
The Immigration Advisory Board is now  fully  operational  as  it  held  its
inaugural meeting earlier today. With this step having been taken,  the  new
system of migration control has now been launched. It will take time  before
the new system will reach its full maturity.  As  people  are  beginning  to
experience the new system they appreciate its greater benefits.

The introduction of the Home Affairs National Identification System  is  the
topmost project aimed at modernising the management of civic  services.  The
Hanis project positions South Africa as a leader in the  field  of  national
identification. After last year's basic system commissioning and the  system
becoming operational in August 2002, about 700 000  ID  application  records
have been captured and we have achieved an  average  of  6  000  application
records intake per day. The system issues strictly unique identity  numbers,
using complex biometrics-reliant technologies.  The  systems  avoids  anyone
being able to have two identity numbers  or  two  persons  having  the  same
identity number, which will curb fraud.

A reliable automated fingerprints identity system  is  in  place.  Essential
matters pertaining to the identity  card  component  are  being  deliberated
with the Hanis stakeholder departments. The  finalisation  of  the  identity
card component is  critical  to  the  overall  progress  of  Hanis  and  the
department is bent on expediting delivery.

I have informed both  the  Cabinet  and  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Home
Affairs that in recent times  I  began  discovering  a  number  of  problems
inherent in the Hanis project and of which I had not  been  apprised  before
June of last year. Some of such problems have massive repercussions for  the
finances of the state. It emerged that some of the  technological  solutions
and project features which were being pursued were  not  the  correct  ones.
New technology has emerged which will enable  us  to  reduce  the  costs  of
identity cards and employ microchips only in respect of certain segments  of
the population which may need them or wish to have them.

In other respects high-density barcodes can achieve all the  intended  goals
of a secure identity card with built-in biometrics which can be read  by  an
optical scanner, whilst serving as the basis which  integrates  e-governance
and the rendering of services by other organs of state as  well  as  private
transactions.

Escalating security considerations have a bearing on the protection  of  the
Hanis system and the data it contains.  Consequently,  a  disaster  recovery
plan has been formulated.

The total Hanis budget for 2003-04 is R258 million.  The  total  expenditure
on the project until February 2003 was R812  million  and  it  is  estimated
that an amount of R438,5 million, excluding the as yet unknown cost  of  the
identity card component as well as  the  aforesaid  disaster  recovery  plan
will still be required. Obviously  this  figure  will  be  affected  by  the
consumer price index and foreign exchange fluctuations and the dancing  that
the rand is doing to the extent that the National Treasury  will  not  hedge
currency exchange risks. It was because of these complexities that  I  could
foresee that I appointed Prof Fink Haysom to have  oversight  responsibility
as a commissioner on the Hanis project.

A  further  systems  development  in  civic   services   pertains   to   the
introduction of an electronic  document  management  system  for  which  the
first contract was awarded in October 2001. The objective of  the  e-DMS  is
to implement an effective, real-time online solution  that  will  cater  for
automated  document  management   processes   from   capture   to   business
transactions  solutions,  thus  resulting  in  the  overall  improvement  of
business process efficiency.

A total of R70 million has already been  spent  on  phase  1  of  the  e-DMS
Project and R52,5 million has been allocated for the current financial  year
in order to complete phase 2. A further R78 million will be required  during
the 2004-05 financial year for phase 3.

These  systems  developments  will  offer  state-of-the-art  technology  and
utility to our citizenry and also enable South Africa to  leapfrog  most  of
the world's technology applications in the field of civic services. As  such
it  will  craft  a  new  outlook  on  governmental  service   delivery   and
significantly boost the Batho Pele imperative.

Following the President's  commitment  in  his  2002  state  of  the  nation
address to the fast-tracking of child support grants and their extension  to
children  up  to  the  age  of  14,  the  department  is  working  in  close
collaboration  with  the  Department  of  Social   Development,   the   lead
department in this project, to ensure an integrated approach with  the  view
to optimising service delivery.

Notwithstanding the inhibiting lack of additional necessary  resources,  the
department has introduced interim measures to reach  many  applicants.  This
includes their incorporation in the Vital Registration  Programme  developed
with the Department of Health and  provincial  hospitals  to  enhance  birth
registrations; the involvement of 29  traditional  authorities  in  KwaZulu-
Natal to assist with birth registrations; participation in the Eastern  Cape
Inter-provincial Support Programme  in  terms  of  which  mobile  units  and
contract workers are  provided  through  De  Loitte  and  Touche  and  other
initiatives. Thus Home Affairs is fully committed to  heed  the  President's
call for poverty alleviation through, amongst other things,  the  expediting
of grant registrations.

Moreover, with effect from 1 April 2003 the department  has  engaged  in  an
identity document campaign that will  continue  until  the  close  of  voter
registration for the 2004 general elections. Currently  the  department  has
the capacity to deal with about  8  000  ID  applications  per  day  with  a
turnaround time of two  months.  It  is  estimated  that  applications  will
escalate to approximately 20 000 a day as the elections draw closer.

Priority target groups such as the youth, rural areas,  farms,  prisons  and
informal settlements will be identified. Additional  mobile  units  will  be
acquired.  A  public  awareness  campaign  will  be  launched  and  National
Treasury has been approached for permission to waive fees pertaining  to  ID
reissues as well as  for  the  department  to  supply  free  photographs  to
applicants. The outcome of this request is still awaited. I  appeal  to  all
stakeholders,  and  in  particular  political  parties,   to   support   our
endeavours in this regard.

The spirit  of  cooperation  and  enthusiasm  which  has  characterised  the
process of launching the new system  of  migration  control  is  impressive.
Especially the collective effort of so many staff members  in  drafting  the
new  immigration  regulations,  the  major  role  of  our  Human   Resources
Development Unit in ensuring training as well as  the  dedication  shown  in
the successful implementation of the Act. A total  of  3338  officials  from
head office, the regions as  well  as  foreign  offices  have  already  been
trained.
Migration management  relies  on  technology,  especially  on  the  Movement
Control System. An amount of R146,42 million was allocated  to  rewrite  the
Movement Control System.  After  allocation  and  before  tenders  could  be
called for, it transpired that the current network used  by  the  department
would not be able to support the envisaged system.  This  implied  that  the
network used by the department would  have  to  be  updated  before  tenders
could be called for.  Consequently  the  department  has  already  purchased
equipment  to  the  amount  of  R4,2  million  during  the   2002-03   year.
Furthermore, the amount of R1,9 million was utilised for the  implementation
of the computerised visa system at 12 missions, and  R2,2  million  for  the
upgrading of equipment at various border posts. The balance will  be  rolled
over and spent once the tenders have been awarded.

The department is making great strides in rendering services to the  refugee
community. However, it is clear that the management of  refugee  affairs  in
this country is becoming exceedingly challenged  with  the  ever  increasing
influx of asylum seekers, many of whom are economic refugees.

It was very interesting, during my recent visit to Bali where  I  met  other
ministers from migration from mainly Pacific countries, to  find  that  even
in their countries 80% of those who apply as refugees are in  fact  economic
refugees, not general refugees.

With its porous borders and  increasing  involvement  of  human  trafficking
cartels, the number of asylum applications  are  set  to  increase  and  the
abuse of it by economic migrants is  a  matter  of  serious  concern  to  my
department.

The current refugee system is not efficient and needs to be replaced  as  it
cannot  be  overhauled.  The  provision  of  staff  coupled  with  extensive
training is essential to do proper status determination  at  first  instance
to  avert  the  ever  increasing  backlogs  experienced  in  processing   of
applications. I will be addressing these issues  in  due  course,  once  the
final recommendations are forthcoming.

It is evident  that  the  situation  of  chronic  under-resourcing  of  Home
Affairs has not as yet been  substantially  rectified.  Although  there  has
been a 32,57% increase in the total  Home  Affairs  allocation  from  R1,486
million in the previous financial year to R1,971 million in  this  year.  If
funding for items such as projects, transfer payments such  as  to  the  IEC
and other earmarked amounts are deducted from both years'  allocations,  the
increase in the  department's  current  budget  is  only  11,1%.  Given  the
foundational nature of Home Affairs' functions  in  respect  of  public  and
State affairs, democratic rights and freedoms, I urge a serious  rethink  on
suitability of our slice of the budget.  I  plead  this  cause,  not  on  my
behalf or that of Home Affairs, but on  behalf  of  all  South  Africans.  I
thank you, Madam Speaker.

Because every person in  South  Africa,  citizens,  residents,  visitors  or
refugees, is a client  of  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs,  high-quality
service delivery is a strategic goal that directs  department  planning  and
action.  The  department  is  committed  to  various  programmes  that  will
fundamentally transform infrastructure and  business  systems  that  provide
platforms for service delivery.

Since 1998 till this financial year, 2003/2004, the  budget  allocation  for
Home Affairs has been increasing in real terms. It is  also  projected  that
in the medium term it will continue to grow.  If  the  budget  continues  to
grow, we need to ask two  important  questions.  The  first  is:  With  this
financial support  that  the  department  is  getting,  has  the  department
transformed itself over the last nine years? The second  question  is:  With
this increase of budget in real  terms  has  the  service  rendered  to  our
people really improved? Yes,  there  has  been  some  improvement,  but  the
process of transformation and service delivery is very slow.

I asked these two questions just over a week ago.  The  Portfolio  Committee
on Home Affairs and the Portfolio Committee on Social Development went on  a
study tour to observe how the two departments are  working  in  the  Eastern
Cape, in the O R Tambo District Municipality. What we saw  there  is  really
pathetic. To this effect the report will be tabled in Parliament soon.

I think it is important to note a few things that  we  saw  on  that  visit.
Among the things that we saw are the following: People in the  old  Transkei
are  still  using  their  Transkei/Ciskei   ID/book   of   life;   lack   of
infrastructure for  home  affairs,  in  particular  in  Mqandule  village  -
elaleni  likaNkosi  Holomisa.   Esikutholile   ukuthi   ihhovisi   loMnyango
wezasekhaya  lakhiwe  njengomjondolo,  alinagesi,   alinazindlu   zangasese,
isitafu sihlala ndawonye. Abantu bakuleyo ndawo bayizigidi eziwu  1.5.  [  -
in the home village of inkosi Holomisa. What  we  found  out  was  that  the
office of home affairs is built like  an  informal  settlement;  it  has  no
electricity and no toilets. The staff is  flocked  in  one  room.  But  this
office is serving about 1,5 million people.] And there are only  two  people
who are servicing that area.

Home affairs offices are not accessible. The rural  people  have  to  travel
300 km to go to home affairs; there is a lack of human  resources  at  those
offices, particularly those in  deep  rural  areas;  and  a  high  level  of
corruption and mismanagement. You know, we went there a week  ago,  and  you
saw on the news on Monday what happened. There was an illegal  home  affairs
office next to the home affairs office in Umtata. Four women were arrested.

For democracy and modern economy to function in a way that is expected,  the
identity and the status  of  all  individuals  living  and  working  in  the
country must be recorded accurately, efficiently and it must be accessible.

Recording the identity of citizens, residents and  visitors  is  crucial  to
the management and regulation of socio-economic and political activities  in
a particular country. It also forms the foundation for  democratisation  and
development of society. Regarding the identity and  status  of  people,  the
country requires a new system of  population  registry.  We  appreciate  the
effort made by the department to rewrite the population register.  Rewriting
the population register becomes imperative.

The realisation of the objective is linked to the  whole  system  of  a  new
identity system known as Home Affairs National  Identification  System.  The
Hanis project was approved by the Cabinet in  1996.  Seven  years  down  the
line we have not yet seen any sign of Hanis. Where is the delay? Why is  the
department rolling over funds that are assigned to Hanis projects?

We call upon the Minister and the Deputy Minister, to whip  their  staff  in
the department to  speed  up  the  implementation  of  this  programme.  The
implementation of  this  programme  will  radically  transform  society  and
improve  service  delivery.  It  will  also  assist  many   departments   in
identifying accurately the beneficiaries of  services  they  render  to  the
public. My colleague  Annelizé  Van  Wyk  will  elaborate  further  on  this
matter.

I indicated earlier that next year people will be going  to  the  polls.  We
want  these  elections  to  be  professionally  organised  and   efficiently
conducted. We do  not  want  the  American  type  of  situation  during  the
presidential  elections  of  2000.  We  want   the   Independent   Electoral
Commission to be given all the necessary  infrastructure  and  resources  to
run efficient and problem-free elections.

On 5 March 2003, this year, Cabinet approved the minority  report  from  the
Electoral Task Team that was chaired by Mr  Slabbert.  The  report  set  the
framework for conducting elections next year. The ANC also  wants  to  agree
with the Cabinet's position on the adoption of the minority report.

This Parliament  needs  to  pass  a  law  that  will  set  a  framework  for
conducting elections next year. Up until now we have not yet done  so.  This
situation will put Parliament under tremendous pressure in  the  next  term.
By not having the law in place we  are  delaying  the  preparations  of  the
Independent Electoral Commission. The IEC needs to conduct  voter  education
in rural areas. And I am saying this because I am worried  about  the  state
of preparedness of the IEC. We need to give them enough time.

We also call upon the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development
and the Department of Home Affairs to co-operate and  finalise  this  matter
as a matter of urgency, if the electoral law has to go  through  Justice  or
Home Affairs. I have already taken up the matter  with  the  Chairperson  of
the Portfolio Committee on Justice, that in  the  near  future  we  will  be
calling the two Ministers,  that  of  Justice,  Mr  Maduna  and  our  Chief,
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, to appear before the two portfolio committees to  tell
us exactly who is responsible for the electoral law.

The ID campaign calls on the Department of Home  Affairs  to  intensify  and
mobilise people to apply for identity documents and the department  to  come
up with a strategy of distribution of IDs.

[We have realised that rural places in  particular  are  visited  by  mobile
units of the Department of Home  Affairs  to  register  people.  This  gives
people a chance to apply for ID documents, and so on. However, there  is  no
mechanism through which these ID documents can be delivered to  the  people.
As I have already pointed out, in Motandole the office does  not  even  have
burglar bars. You find that  ID  documents  are  packed  in  boxes  and  are
scattered all over the place.
Anyone who goes there is therefore told to look for his or her own ID  among
those scattered around. As a result, we suggest that the Department of  Home
Affairs should at least have a mechanism whereby these ID documents  can  be
effectively delivered to the people, so that  those  who  have  applied  for
them can receive them. We also  appeal  to  members  of  Parliament,  as  we
stated yesterday, that they  should  also  contribute  to  the  campaign  of
making sure that ID documents are accordingly distributed  to  their  owners
in their regions. Another important factor is that ...]

[... the budget that has been allocated to the Department  of  Home  Affairs
with regard to the election campaign is very small. We will be working  with
the department to ask the Treasury to increase this budget, because  if  one
compares it with the budget for previous  elections,  one  finds  that  that
budget was over R80 million. But the budget for the coming elections is  R15
million, and we believe that this budget should be increased so  that  those
of our people who do not have IDs get them.]

The other point that I want raise is that the majority of our people in  the
rural areas do not have the means to pay for ID photos. I  think  that  this
is something that we definitely have to take up,  as  a  department  and  as
Government, to help those who are unemployed and and those who do  not  have
money to pay for ID photos. Do you know how expensive it is to  have  an  ID
photo taken? It costs R45, when families cannot  even  raise  R2,50  to  buy
bread at home, particularly in the rural areas. So we will  be  making  this
call to  the  department  and  Government  [Interjections.]  You,  shut  up!
[Applause.]

Immigration has been part of humanity from  time  immemorial.  In  a  modern
globalised world which is set to isolate us from the rest of the world,  the
Immigration Act that we passed last year was an honest attempt on  our  part
to deal with the thorny issue of immigration from  a  progressive  point  of
view and to be a human rights-orientated piece of legislation.

One issue that I want to raise, which really worries me very much,  is  this
question of immigration regulations. We  have  called  the  department  many
times to say that, directed by  the  Act  of  this  Parliament  when  making
regulations, we have to follow section 7 of  the  Act.  We  have  made  that
submission from the beginning. My only worry is that the  appeals  that  the
department is currently engaged in are not really helping. At the same  time
the department is complying with the Act.

We have just observed this afternoon; invited by the Minister on the  launch
of the Immigration Advisory Board, which we really  appreciate.  It  is  the
right step in the right direction. We appreciate the progress that has  been
made. But the only worry that we have is this. Why do we continue  with  the
appeals in the Supreme Court and Constitutional Court when we are  complying
with the Act itself. I believe that it is not correct and it  is  something,
if one has the powers, I was going to ask the Minister to withdraw,  because
it is just a waste of time and of  Government  resources  to  continue  with
these appeals.
South Africa has been accused of being xenophobic. This  has  been  levelled
against us because of the way that we treat our  citizens  in  the  country.
The recent court battle that I  have  just  mentioned  really  needs  to  be
addressed.

I now come to Government printing. The  staff  at  the  Government  Printing
Works are depleted. There is a total lack of capacity in the office. It  has
led to a total collapse in management and financial  controls.  Perhaps  due
to lack of experience, some members of the staff in the printing works  have
overlooked the rule that outlined how certain  issues  are  supposed  to  be
handled. I am raising this issue because  of  the  report  of  the  Auditor-
General.

The Auditor-General highlights two important  areas  within  the  Government
Printing Works. The first one is the problem  of  proper  financial  control
relating to debt collection. This is a result of posts that  are  vacant  in
the department. As the Minister has already said, we  have  about  a  1  500
backlog, but I believe that it is critical that with the 300 posts  that  we
will be filling, we need to focus on the strategic posts that will  be  able
to cover some of the areas where some kind of support is lacking.

The Department of Home Affairs should  intensify  staff  training  on  Batho
Pele as this is one of the  areas  that  reflect  quite  negatively  on  the
department, particularly in the rural areas. There is a need  to  train  our
staff in public relations at all levels.

Ngicabanga ukuthi lena ngenye yezinto  okumele  sizame  ukuzenza.  [I  think
this is one of the things that we should try.]

In one of our meetings in Umtata, we mobilised almost 2 000 people  and  the
Departments of Home  Affairs  and  Social  Development  were  issuing  birth
certificates and  ID  applications.  The  official  from  Home  Affairs  was
addressing a group of women. Most of them had their surnames  wrongly  spelt
in their IDs. Some of them had their age reduced in their IDs and all  that.
The official was holding a cellphone on the one side, while on the other  he
was telling people to shut up because he was speaking on the  cellphone.  So
I think these are some of the things that are really not going well for  our
people.

One of the areas that I want to raise again that  of  legislation.  I  think
this area is one of the areas that we need to capacitate,  because  we  were
told that this year there are a  number  of  Bills  that  are  going  to  be
amended. We are already now in the second quarter and we have not  yet  seen
anything and I believe that there are quite critical Bills  that  we  wanted
to amend. But the department did not bring them forward  and  I  think  that
the Minister and the Deputy Minister should work  on  this  area,  and  make
sure that these areas are addressed.

The last area that I want to raise is this. There is a need to have a  clear
strategic  plan  on  Government's  position  with  regard  to  the  role  of
traditional leaders and municipalities doing Home Affairs work at the  local
level. Home Affairs is a national competency according to  the  Constitution
of this country and it must  be  clearly  defined  what  the  role  of  each
structure will be and the accountability process  must  be  clearly  stated.
This needs to be addressed as it is beginning to create  problems  in  other
areas. Yes, we know that traditional leaders are playing a particular  role,
but it is not clearly defined as to what it is that  we  expect  from  them.
Are we saying to them that they can now begin to do Home  Affairs  work?  If
they  are  going  to  do  that,  how  are  they  going   to   account?   And
municipalities, especially those without capacity,  are  we  going  to  give
them permission to start doing Home Affairs work and all of that?

I think these are some of the things that I would like to urge the  Minister
and the Deputy Minister to take up with Cabinet and come  up  with  a  clear
policy as to exactly what to expect from these areas.

Lastly, I would  like  to  thank  the  Minister,  the  Deputy  Minister  and
congratulate the newly appointed  Director-General,  Barry  Gilder,  on  the
appointment and thank the members of the portfolio committee in saying  that
we have to co-operate for better service  delivery.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, first and foremost I  would  like  to  thank  my
colleague, hon Sakkie Pretorious, for allowing me to  speak  first  in  this
debate for the DA as I have commitments in my constituency tonight.  I  hope
the hon Minister will accept my apologies for not being  able  to  stay  for
the entire debate.

Child pornography is a growing crime in our country and  amendments  to  the
Films and Publications Act are desperately needed.

According to the Sunday  Times  report  there  are  over  100  000  websites
worldwide that offer child  pornography.  The  report  further  argues  that
these figures represent an increase of 345% between February and  July  2001
alone.

It is very difficult to begin to estimate the number of  children  who  have
been sexually abused, tortured and even murdered  to  meet  the  demands  of
child abuse images,  but,  at  the  very  least,  it  must  be  hundreds  of
thousands.

Given the  nature  of  the  Internet,  any  increase  in  the  creation  and
distribution of child abuse images in any part of the world is  an  increase
in every part of the world.

As Michael Malone of ABC News  said,  ``Child  pornography  is  not  a  tiny
industry but a global empire. It is not some crude or amateurish  operation,
but a sophisticated octopus with revenues of billions of dollars.''

Let no one be fooled, child pornography is not sex  between  two  consenting
people. It is between an adult and an innocent child  who  often  have  been
drugged, beaten, coerced into consuming alcohol and  in  some  cases  simply
handed over by their parents.

A task team was appointed three and a half years ago to look into  the  very
matter of child pornography and to  propose  amendments  to  the  Films  and
Publications Act. The DA would  like  to  know  what  has  happened  to  the
proposed amendments from the task team. I am  sure  that  the  hon  Minister
will remember that, in last year's Budget Vote, I called for the  amendments
to be made public so that we as MPs and civil society could  be  engaged  in
the matter.

The DA would like to see amendments to the Films and Publications Act,  that
would include an obligation on the service provider to shut down  any  child
pornography site, once the  authorities  have  identified  it  and  notified
them, and that section 27 be amended as it places two provisions  on  police
officers, namely that before a search warrant is issued police  offers  have
to obtain a certificate from the Director of  Public  Prosecutions  here  in
Cape Town enabling the magistrate  of  the  relevant  district  to  issue  a
search warrant. Secondly, that police officers have to travel  all  the  way
to Cape Town simply to obtain a certificate from the Films and  Publications
Board which states that the confiscated material has  not  been  classified.
These requirements are an absolute waste of time, money and resources.

In combating child pornography we must remind  ourselves  that  every  child
pornography picture represents a child who has been violated, a child  whose
life has been destroyed, a child whom  we  as  legislators  have  failed.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, well, it's unfortunate that the  Chairperson
of the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has not been able  to  understand
the dynamics of appealing the Constitutional Court ruling  on  one  side  on
the Home Affairs regulations while at  the  same  time  complying  with  the
ruling. The reading of law and democracy enjoyed in the country seems to  be
difficult for the portfolio committee chairperson to absorb - after  all  he
has just joined the portfolio committee - it's not surprising.

The Treasury is faced with transfer payments of about R40 million,  this  in
the coming financial year, to the IEC for the coming general election.  This
is a substantive amount for a worthwhile cause. But for  how  long  are  the
results of that election going to remain valid in the  face  of  the  floor-
crossing legislation before they are depleted and undermined in the eyes  of
the same electorate that produced them.

The country pays for the mandates it gives to the political parties  to  run
the affairs of the nation according to tallies counted  at  the  end  of  an
election. Responsible politicians will  guard  against  those  mandates  and
don't obliterate them to the detriment of the fiscus. If this law  was  born
at a time of constituency-based elections this debate  would  be  different.
As it stands now, it's like a  prematurely  born  baby  born  in  haste  and
grappling with a sliding opportunity.

In every election the IEC ensures that each election is  fair  and  free  of
any ambiguity. The strength of the parties is declared by  the  IEC  as  the
end product of its fairness. When that end product is changed to suit  party
A against party B, it no more represents the fairness declared  at  the  end
of the election and the credibility of the process  that  consumed  millions
of rands from the state coffers simply becomes nothing more than a token.

However, it is hoped that the floor-crossing  legislation  will  not  affect
the morale of the IEC. Notwithstanding the above, the IFP supports the  Home
Affairs Budget Vote.

One of the outstanding features of the IEC is to promote  co-operation  with
and between persons, institutions, governments and administrations  for  the
achievement of the IEC objectives. Floor-crossing  legislation,  instead  of
promoting such co-operation between persons, has  created  a  major  discord
among those who have escaped through the window of  opportunity,  no  matter
what their personal reasons are. In fact,  personal  reasons  don't  play  a
part in the arena of our work as politicians  but  party  mandates  are  the
dictums.

Each of us in this House, carry the votes of thousands  of  voters  for  the
parties we represent. I carry no single vote for myself. My name was not  on
the ballot paper. I am only a servant of my party placed here  purely  on  a
party proportional-list system to serve the interest of my  party.  I  carry
no free mandate.

For that and other reasons, the Constitutional  Court  could  not  pronounce
itself on the morality of floor-crossing. The freedom fighters,  during  the
days of the struggle cried  out  to  the  world  that  apartheid  laws  were
immoral and an affront to humanity. Where do we stand now  with  this  piece
of legislation in terms of the morality of our laws?

The IFP calls on political parties that did not support the passage of  this
legislation in this  House  to  engage  in  research  as  to  the  level  of
destabilisation of the parliamentary  standards  set  by  the  1999  general
election results. Well, I  know  the  majority  party  would  not  like  the
results of that research but they'll be a concrete reflection of  the  level
of destabilisation caused by the legislation they initiated.

The  portfolio  committee,  over  many  years,  has  been  urging  that  the
Department of Home Affairs was terribly understaffed  and  could  not  reach
its targeted efficiency levels with such  a  limited  number  of  personnel.
However, we are heartened to echo  the  announcement  by  the  hon  Minister
today that the moratorium that exists in the filling  of  the  vacant  posts
have been partially lifted in the 349  critical  posts  -  that  is  welcome
news. But the number is too small  compared  to  the  number  of  unoccupied
posts in the department.

Home Affairs ports of entry  are  the  underbellies  of  the  South  African
nation and need to be properly staffed with the most  efficient  and  highly
trained members of society. The IFP policy recognises that the  Ministry  of
Home Affairs is charged with difficult and complex tasks,  which  require  a
high  degree  of  competence  and  integrity.  Many  important  elements  of
government policy depend on the efficient performance of  this  Ministry  in
facilitating freedom of expression and  movement,  preservation  of  society
values and domestic harmony.

The Department of Home Affairs personnel should be recruited from  the  best
and most talented and should offer the citizen, the  would-be  citizens  and
the visitors, the most efficient service available. According to one of  the
former chairpersons of the portfolio committee - there he sits -  the  staff
at ports of entry are the  face  of  the  nation  and  the  bedrock  of  the
country, so he said. Foreigners entering the country see them  first  before
seeing the head of state. Therefore, they must be a shining  symbol  of  the
country.

If wishes were horses, the bulk of the  349  posts  would  be  allocated  to
border offices. However,  we  applaud  serving  members  of  staff  of  this
department who, despite the shortage, are able  to  stretch  themselves  and
reach out to any identified need over and beyond their job descriptions.  We
thank you ladies and gentlemen for your dedication to serve your nation.

We call on all those  who  could  not  bear  the  pressure  but  decided  to
emigrate to Europe to reconsider their frustration for the sake of this  new
nation which desperately needs their skills and talent.

The service delivery points of this department to its citizens  and  foreign
nationals is contained in programme 2 of its budget estimates. Of  the  many
deliverables,  one  of  them  is  travel  and  passport  matters,  which  is
adequately addressed in the new Immigration Act. The Act provides  about  14
types of permit systems for entry and exit purposes.
It's unfortunate that this law has taken so  long  to  enter  our  country's
Statute Book and be implemented  according  to  its  regulations,  still  in
draft form. The process has  been  arduous  and  causes  unnecessary  delay,
which has given a breathing space for  illegal  immigrants  to  violate  our
borders without checks and balances.

If the permit system envisaged by  the  drafters  of  the  legislation  were
adopted as they were, South Africa would be one  of  the  countries  in  the
world with amenable and user-friendly border registration to  both  citizens
and foreigners, reducing the risk of back  door  immigration  and  promoting
the prospects of foreign skills and capital coming into  the  country.  Back
door immigration bears a detrimental effect on the upkeep  of  the  country.
All citizens  have  documents  to  prove  their  existence  -  so  must  the
foreigners.

Some people think that Home Affairs is the enemy of the foreigners which  is
a wrong perception, of course. What Home Affairs wants from  the  foreigners
are the documents that prove their existence in the  country  so  that  they
may enjoy the liberties provided for them, in our Constitution.

The President has charged the country to alleviate  all  levels  of  poverty
and hunger in the country, but this cannot be achieved if Home  Affairs  has
no statistics of all the people who live in the country.

Foreigners need to work for their  living.  They  need  to  receive  medical
assistance when necessary. Their children need to attend  school  and  enjoy
all liberties enshrined in the Constitution of South Africa,  provided  they
come forward and prove their existence in the country.

It would be a sad day for  foreigners  if  they  wait  for  law  enforcement
agents to visit them in their apartments and settlements  as  the  case  may
be.  Because,  they  will  think  South  Africa  is  harsh   on   them   and
unsympathetic to the conditions obtained in  their  countries.  Whereas  the
Constitution and the  law  of  South  Africa  passed  recently  by  the  hon
Minister of Home  Affairs  provides  for  their  wellbeing.  Foreigners  are
welcome  if  they  come  forward  and  register  their  presence  with   the
Department  of  Home  Affairs  officials.  Foreigners  are  welcome  in  our
country. I thank you Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Mr Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Home
Affairs Shenge, members of the portfolio committee, hon  members,  officials
of the department, dear friends, two days ago we bade  farewell  to  one  of
the foremost stalwarts of the struggle for the liberation of our people.  We
saw fit that on this day of presenting our Budget  Vote  to  this  House  we
dedicate this occasion in honour of this servant of our people.

Throughout his life iSithwalandwe  Walter  Sisulu  taught  us  that  it  was
possible to serve and to give to humanity,  even  as  an  ordinary  man  who
occupies no office of note in Government. With  only  a  heart  befitting  a
father of a nation, without a  plush  office  and  control  of  millions  in
budget,  he  made  a  lasting  impression  and  set  an  example   of   true
selflessness to his people. His  own  life,  as  if  by  destiny,  had  been
intrinsically linked to that of the ANC, the movement to which he  dedicated
his whole self for the love and patriotism  he  felt  for  his  country.  He
committed himself to resolving all South African problems and to building  a
nation united, democratic, nonsexist and devoid of poverty and hunger.

Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr Barry Gilder  on  his  appointment
by Cabinet as the new Director-General of our  department.  [Applause.]  His
appointment, having been timed by history to coincide  with  the  period  of
mourning and celebrating the life of  Walter  Sisulu,  should  place  on  Mr
Gilder the challenge to emulate this  great  leader  who  was  the  ultimate
public servant. Sisulu understood and embraced the core values  that  should
underpin our work as  public  servants,  such  as  humility,  honesty,  good
governance and a great sense of love for the people  we  serve.  The  public
that we  serve  expects  no  less  than  this.  And  as  you  take  up  your
responsibility, we hope that  these  would  be  the  values  to  which  your
leadership will direct our department.

As we present this Budget Vote to this House today, we  speak  without  fear
of contradiction that at the time of his death, Tata Sisulu was a happy  man
who believed that this Government is firmly on track towards  achieving  all
those things for which he fought. His rest will be  an  even  more  peaceful
one in the knowledge that those of us in the leadership of  this  Government
have committed ourselves to going beyond the current gains  that  have  been
made in building a better South Africa and for generations to come. And  for
as long as we hold true to this commitment,  his  legacy  will  prevail  and
will never perish.

It has been another 12 months since  we  last  came  to  this  distinguished
House to present to you  our  plans  for  the  previous  year,  and  we  had
requested your support in passing a budget that would realise  those  plans.
As the hon Minister has already done, we come back to you here to report  on
the progress we have registered towards the  attainment  of  some  of  those
plans.

The Department of Home Affairs has  been  undergoing  several  changes  that
have  had  an  impact  on  our  operational,  programmatic  and  legislative
imperatives. I will try and address some  of  these  and  the  relevance  of
their impact on the work that we are doing as a department.

At  a  structural  level  the  previous  year  saw  us  grapple   with   the
implementation of the restructuring process as  dictated  by  Resolutions  7
and 8 of the Public Service Collective Bargaining  Council.  As  the  entire
Public Service moves towards the conclusion of this process, it has  brought
to the fore a few things that will require our urgent attention  if  we  are
to realise transformation priorities within our department.

At the end of June, when the resolution stops its effect, we  will  need  to
roll out a plan for  thoroughgoing  transformation  within  the  department.
This plan will have to ensure that our conceptualisation  of  transformation
goes beyond just ensuring representivity and parity,  but  also  strives  to
build a machinery that is efficient  and  effective,  and  to  position  our
human resource as an asset committed to serving society with  diligence  and
care.

We have already been in discussion with our top management  and  raised  our
concern that it is unacceptable for a department that operates in  this  era
not to have a single female at the level above that of a  director.  As  the
department  finalises  our  current  establishment  investigation  and   the
restructuring process, this matter will have to receive urgent attention.

As hon  members  will  understand,  the  process  of  implementing  the  new
Immigration Act has not been an easy one, and I believe  that  this  largely
owes to the fact that migration itself is  an  area  of  complexity  and  it
tends to generate conflict. We have a lot to learn from our  own  processes,
however, and we will always  strive  to  handle  similar  complexities  much
better, should they arise in the future, as we overhaul our policy regime.

For its  part,  the  implementation  of  the  new  Act  is  allowing  us  an
opportunity to move away from an era when  immigration  of  foreigners  into
our country was regarded as a burden for the state, as opposed to  being  an
opportunity for  them  to  contribute  to  the  rebuilding  of  our  country
alongside ourselves.

It is incumbent on South Africans, as  leaders  of  the  AU  and  the  Nepad
programme, to prioritise Africa in our planning, in our policies and in  the
implementation of our programmes. The  Department  of  Home  Affairs  has  a
central role in the process  of  changing  the  general  attitude  that  our
people in particular hold about people from other parts  of  our  continent.
This will require a general reorientation on our work, particularly  in  the
area of immigration, by retraining our immigration officials.

In this regard, it also gives me great pleasure to  report  that  Government
has become a significant partner in the efforts to educate our people  about
the dangers of xenophobia and to stem out the prejudice that results in  the
ill-treatment of foreigners who come into our  country,  specifically  those
from the rest of the African continent.

It is important for the state to take responsibility for making  the  public
aware that foreigners who come into our country are capable  of  integrating
into our communities and  helping  us  in  the  reconstruction  process.  We
should always remember that before they were forced  to  flee  the  familiar
environments that had  been  their  homes  all  their  lives,  into  unknown
destinations, each one of those refugees had once been a  loving  father,  a
devoted husband, a loved son, a wife, a mother, a daughter,  and  that  they
are as ordinary and human, with normal fears, hopes  and  dreams  just  like
each one of us in this House.

We also had an opportunity  to  participate  in  the  discussions  aimed  at
finalising the protection agenda for refugees all over the world during  the
UNHCR Exco, held in Geneva at the end of last year. And I want to thank  the
hon Minister for allowing me and for giving me the  opportunity  to  attend.
The agenda itself places  additional  responsibility  on  member  states  to
ensure improved protection of refugees within their borders.

In line with our undertaking of this responsibility, we are  going  to  look
at possible ways of improving the conditions of  refugees  in  our  country,
and to address the many problems that were brought to our attention.

I've already requested that we investigate the possibility  of  establishing
a refugee centre for women and children. These  centres  will  allow  us  to
give special attention to protection issues affecting  the  most  vulnerable
categories of refugees in any society.  Modelled  along  the  lines  of  the
Esperance Centre that is run by the Catholic Church here in Cape  Town,  the
centre would be able to look at  issues  such  as  skills  training,  health
counselling and general development and upliftment  of  women  and  children
refugees.

I must also recognise the presence in this gallery of the women who run  the
Esperance Centre for Women Refugees, led by Ms Nzwaki Mtshengu.  [Applause.]
At the beginning of the year Cabinet held its planning Lekgotla,  which  was
intended at integrating different plans of  the  department  into  a  common
programme of Government and to  identify  Government's  priorities  for  the
year. This new planning approach by Government is  aimed  at  ensuring  that
there is integrated service delivery and  seeks  to  avoid  a  situation  in
which departments operate in isolation.

Our own strategic planning session has recognised that it has  become  quite
necessary for us as a department to focus on those priorities determined  by
the Lekgotla. Government as a whole has  committed  itself  to  moving  with
speed with regard to the finalisation  of  the  Hanis  system,  and  we  are
currently looking at plans  for  the  rewrite  of  the  National  Population
Register in order to improve its integrity.

The rest of the priorities identified by the Lekgotla will  also  form  part
of the focus of the department during the current year,  and  these  include
enhancing the capacity of the  department  by  addressing  staff  shortages,
improving security arrangements for top  security  documents  such  as  IDs,
passports, permits - which  have  become  readily  available  in  the  black
market  -  developing  an  operational  procedure  for  border  control  and
addressing the corruption activities associated with the ports of entry.

Hon members will remember that last year we raised  serious  concerns  about
the number of South African children who are not  registered  and  thus  are
unable to receive Government services,  such  as  education,  child  support
grants, health care and other services to which they are entitled.

We also lamented the fact that by not registering  these  children,  we  are
denying them their most  fundamental  right,  that  of  having  a  name  and
identity  that  represent  recognition  of  their  existence  as  bona  fide
citizens with a claim to this beautiful and rich country.

We are proud to come back and report that officials in the  department  have
taken heed of the call to seek these children and register  them,  and  that
currently we've administered a huge dent  with  regard  to  the  problem  of
registration of our children.  The  Department  of  Social  Development  has
expressed gratitude to us  for  making  their  work  possible  by  providing
enabling  documentation  that  allows  them  to   make   progress   in   the
registration of almost 3 million children who were outside the  child  grant
system.

As the Minister reported earlier on, we must be doing something  right.  The
problem is, however,  still  far  from  being  resolved.  Not  only  is  our
challenge that of addressing the current backlog of  unregistered  children,
but also putting in place the best system that ensures that every  child  is
registered at birth, without exception, whether they are born at home or  at
health facilities, whether in a marriage or through  teenage  pregnancy  and
whether their parents are homeless, rich or poor.  In  order  to  meet  this
challenge, it will be necessary that we  move  with  speed  to  enhance  the
capacity of our  regional  offices  as  the  implementing  arm  for  service
delivery so as to be able to reach more people on the ground.

The AU, launched here in South Africa last year, has now declared  that  the
focus of the celebration of the Day of the African Child in June  this  year
should be: ``Birth registration for all children of  Africa.''  We've  taken
this  declaration  very  seriously  and  are  currently  joining  hands   in
partnership with Unicef for the implementation plans aimed at making this  a
reality. We are highly encouraged by and grateful for the enthusiasm  showed
by agencies such as Unicef in providing some of the resources  necessary  to
address issues and to address this campaign in particular.

The provision of IDs is one of the most important functions that we  perform
at Home Affairs, particularly because of the  significance  that  these  IDs
have to the people of this country. Again,  Tat'  uSisulu  has  provided  us
with an attitude to emulate. Whereas during the  Defiance  Campaign  of  the
1950s he led the people to burn their  old  dompasses,  as  we  see  in  the
photos all over the place in magazines and books, because  they  were  tools
that were used to oppress them, until his death,  however,  he  had  carried
the new green book with pride, and he believed that  it  provided  him  with
dignity and pride as a South African.

As we approach the general elections next year, we have a responsibility  of
ensuring that every deserving South African  has  an  enabling  document  to
allow him or her to exercise his or her hard-earned right  to  vote  in  the
elections. With  the  scarce  resources  at  our  disposal,  we've  taken  a
decision to roll  out  this  campaign  as  part  of  our  core  business  of
providing every  citizen  with  an  ID  book,  and  the  additional  special
allocation from Treasury should be used to bolster this operation.

We've already been in consultation with relevant stakeholders. I learn  that
the officials have  been  attending  workshops  with  the  IEC,  the  school
authorities and community leaders  with  regard  to  the  roll  out  of  the
campaign. It is our intention that not a single South  African  must  remain
without an ID, and that the department  has  a  responsibility  to  allocate
equitable resources, based on need, to all corners of the country to  ensure
that this happens.

The Films and Publications Board is funded from this budget,  and  I  should
indicate that as the Ministry  responsible  for  the  board,  we  have  been
satisfied with the amount of work that they put into  addressing  their  key
mandates. The board is responsible for control and regulation of  films  and
publications intended for distribution or exhibition within the republic  by
means of classification or exemptions.

The Films  and  Publication  Amendment  Bill  that  the  hon  Minister  will
introduce in this House during the current session  is  aimed  at  enhancing
the capacity  of  the  board  and  law-enforcement  agencies  to  deal  more
effectively with noncompliance with the law,  specifically  with  regard  to
the issue of combating child pornography images.

And I want to promise the hon Zulu and acknowledge the issue he  has  raised
as a matter of concern. In fact, the Films and Publications Board should  be
seized  with  the  matter  whether  in  fact  people  should   go   to   the
Constitutional Court to appeal on issues of morality and claim  that  it  is
correct to possess child pornography. I am really taking that  comment  very
seriously and it applies to the issue  raised  by  the  hon  Waters.  It  is
unacceptable that anyone, any South African, should possess images of  child
pornography, and we are doing our best to sort out this  problem.  It  is  a
big problem. It's like a new toy around town,  particularly  here  in  South
Africa.

The board is also currently involved in a schools  internet  safety  project
aimed at educating school children and teachers about  the  responsible  and
safe usage of the internet in schools. And these are some of the things  ...
It is easy for us to make some of the demands we are  making:  ``Let's  have
internet in our schools; all children should have access to the  internet'',
etc. But we also have to look at the flip side of it. What  is  it  that  we
are subjecting these children to? What is it that we are exposing them  too?
In fact, we  are  exposing  them  to,  amongst  other  things,  pornography,
particularly child pornography.

We've also informed  the  House  about  the  process  of  repositioning  the
Government  Printing  Works.  The  utility  itself  was  established  as   a
centralised national printing works responsible  for  meeting  the  printing
and stationery requirements of the Government.

The current structural arrangements of the Government  Printing  works  have
been  a  cause  for  concern,  and  Cabinet  recognised  the  need  for  its
restructuring  and  repositioning.  The  Auditor-General  has  also   raised
additional concerns with regard to the finances and  general  administration
of the utility. Amongst these  has  been  the  adverse  audit  opinion,  the
collection of moneys from debtor departments and the writing off  of  stock.
We are currently looking  at  the  possibility  of  conducting  an  external
investigation regarding these and other cases.

We  have  ongoing  interactions  that  involve  the  Department  of   Public
Enterprises and the Treasury  in  resolving  some  of  these  processes  and
finalising of the restructuring process, and we will report  to  this  House
on progress.
May I conclude by  reaffirming  our  commitment  to  improving  the  general
service delivery approach of our department, and that we will from  time  to
time come back to you to present our reports as required. May I  also  thank
the officials of the department for providing me with all the  support  that
I needed, as a new deputy Minister in the  department,  by  briefing  me  on
developments in the department, educating me and informing me about  various
processes involved in taking  certain  decisions  about  work  done  in  the
department. I thank you, hon members. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, the vision of the department is to render a world-
class service. Indeed, it is a  noble  vision.  Its  mission  is  to  commit
itself as required by stipulated mandates to determine  and  confirm  status
of persons by providing enabling documents in  the  interest  of  protecting
and promoting the national integrity.

The mandates of the Department of  Home  Affairs  include,  civic  services,
births,  marriages  and  deaths,  identity  documents  and   identification,
citizenship, travel documents, passports and migration. Its  core  functions
include  civic  services  and  migration.  Of  course  to  fulfil  its  core
functions, it needs the necessary technology,  human  and  other  resources.
The  question  is:  Does  this  budget  address  these  critical   concerns?
Secondly, does this budget in any way contribute in  some  tangible  way  to
fulfilling its vision and mission?

Perhaps the hon Minister might take further time  to  provide  us  with  the
relevant  clarifications.  Recent  visits  to  some  Home  Affairs   offices
revealed the following: In Johannesburg, long lines of  people  waiting  and
such people complaining that they were being sent from one  counter  to  the
other by impatient officials, and at the end of the day told to  return  the
next day.

In the Braamfontein office that deals with refugees people  wait  from  7am,
and at any point during the day the whole  street  is  blocked  with  people
trying to access the office and the officials. This goes on day  day  after.
Ultimately the majority are  denied  access  to  the  office  by  using  one
pretext or another.

The office in Alberton  is  orderly  and  efficient.  Problems  are  managed
without delay. Even though the office deals with  huge  numbers  of  people,
somehow they seem to get it right. Again there is a question, why are  there
such contradictions. Again perhaps the hon  Mininister  will  find  time  to
give this House a clear explanation and, furthermore, take active  steps  to
remedy this chaotic situation where it exists.

In February 2003, the hon  Minister  stated  that  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs had 1915 vacant  posts  of  which  374  were  at  the  Head  Office,
Government Printing works had 358, Western  Cape  region  68,  Eastern  Cape
region 57 Northern Cape 30, KwaZulu-Natal 74,  Limpopo  84,  Mpumalanga  97,
Gauteng west 97, Gauteng east 88, North West 90, Free State 46 and 452  post
that were frozen.

Again he stated that Cabinet approved only the filling of  349  posts.  This
raises a very critical question. In such an environment with so many  vacant
posts, how can anyone expect the department  to  function  effectively.  The
Hanis project cost continues to escalate. One has to consider just what  the
final cost would be. Can this proposed budget contribute in  any  meaningful
way to it? Maybe the Minister would give us some explanation  and  take  the
necessary remedial action.

Another of the great concerns is that it is a fact  that  there  is  such  a
wildspread corruption by  persons,  excluding  Department  of  Home  Affairs
officials that appear to be able at will to produce SA  identity  documents,
passports and other documents, thereby directly  defeating  the  purpose  of
the department in terms of its vision and mission.

Maybe the Minister can explain to us what portion of  this  proposed  budget
will be used to ensure the  integrity  of  our  national  identification  as
citizens and bring to book such perpetrators that  exist  in  this  country.
This budget should also seek to address issues that could determine  whether
or not people  receive  their  IDs  in  time  to  vote  in  the  forthcoming
elections. With such a huge staff shortage, I  fear  this  may  not  be  the
case, especially in the light of the fact that the Minister,  in  his  reply
to the House on Wednesday, said that he intends to  allow  noncitizens  that
have permanent residence to take part in the forthcoming elections. Does  he
have sufficient staff to allow this to happen? Does this  budget  cater  for
this purpose?

It will give all South Africans a great  sense  of  relief  if  we  have  to
receive reassurance from the Minister that there is sufficient personnel  to
manage a daily work in addition to  the  forthcoming  elections.  Again,  it
will be more encouraging if the budget would seek to enhance the  conditions
of employment of staff in this department.

Everyone has the life registered from birth and at death. So everyone of  us
has  a  vested  interest  in  ensuring  that   this   department   functions
effectively. Orange Farm is a typical example of an area where there are  no
facilities for home affairs. In  addition  to  unemployment,  the  residents
experience great hardships in trying to obtain ID documents. Thank you.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, the Budget  Vote
before us today  is  aimed  at  realising,  protecting  and  regulating  the
individual status, identity and  supporting  services  to  the  citizens  of
South Africa. It is the often  unacknowledged  foundation  upon  which  most
democratic rights and services are built. It should go without  saying  that
this vital task must be performed effectively and efficiently, because  this
budget  directly  affects  everything  from  protecting  this  country  from
illegal smuggling across our borders to the access of  the  poor  to  social
grants.

Unfortunately, the department has been beset with a range of  problems  that
cannot be ignored  any  longer,  because  Parliament  continues  to  approve
budgets whilst the returns do not materialise. Hardly a single  decision  by
the department occurs without  it  being  turned  into  a  political  battle
between the hon Minister and the ruling  party.  Hence,  we  have  seen  the
unnecessary  costly  and  lengthy  process  of  drafting  proper   migration
legislation.  Similarly,  the  long  and  winding  issues  surrounding   the
Director-General of the department. In addition, there is the issue  of  the
high number of vacancies at senior management level in  the  department  for
an extended period.

Finally, the department is regularly the respondent in court cases that  are
costly. This litany of challenges in the face of the immense  task  expected
from the department is a recipe for  disaster.  During  the  course  of  the
coming year, this budget has to provide for  such  far-reaching  matters  as
the highly sensitive home affairs national identification system  process  -
the electronic document management system and the  upcoming  provincial  and
national elections.

The UDM would appreciate this budget translating into a  greater  commitment
to rolling out home affairs offices and  services  to  all  regions  in  the
country. Because in many areas, often those where  poverty  is  endemic  and
people are dependent upon grants, the lack of home affairs services  present
a real obstacle to those who want to avoid starvation.

In the face of such massive responsibilities  and  a  tight  budget,  it  is
clear that the department will have to  approach  the  coming  year  with  a
renewed emphasis on service delivery.  For  far  too  long,  the  focus  has
consistently been on periphery issues which seem  always  to  generate  into
political battles.

The UDM appeals to the hon Minister to spearhead this  renewed  emphasis  on
service delivery. We urge all to support the Minister wholeheartedly,  since
he was after all  appointed  to  fill  this  position.  Political  bickering
surrounding this  department  could  cost  this  country  and  its  citizens
dearly, and nullify the billions of rands that  we  are  approving  in  this
budget today. The UDM supports the Budget Vote. I thank you.

Ms M M MAUNYE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  Deputy  Ministers,  comrades
and hon members, I stand  in  support  of  the  budget  allocation  for  the
Department of Home Affairs.  Secondly,  I  want  to  congratulate  Mr  Barry
Gilder on  his  appointment  as  the  director-general  of  the  department.
[Applause.]

I dedicate my speech to the baby  orphan  we  met  in  Mqanduli  during  our
recent study tour to the Eastern Cape. The baby  was  in  the  care  of  the
grandparents as both the parents had passed on. When I looked at the baby  I
saw a cute little child with a friendly smile, who touched  our  hearts.  In
the cool morning weather of the Eastern Cape, the baby did not have  a  vest
or napkin on. He was wrapped in a towel. The grandparents could  not  access
the child support grant for the baby, because they did not  have  the  valid
documents to apply for the child's birth certificate. If we  are  really  to
push back the frontiers of poverty, we  need  to  do  something  about  such
cases and do it fast. [Applause.]

The focus of this debate will be on civic  and  auxiliary  services  in  the
department. This is a very important section within the department,  because
it deals  with  birth  and  death  certificates,  the  issuing  of  IDs  and
passports, and also the maintenance of the population register.

Of great concern to me  is  the  population  register,  which  has  been  in
existence for more than 30 years and  has  never  been  improved.  It  still
reflects the philosophy and thinking of the old order. This  register  needs
to be rewritten to reflect the new philosophy and thinking of the new  South
Africa. It needs to incorporate all the citizens of the  country,  including
those who resided in  the  former  homelands  of  Transkei,  Bophuthatswana,
Venda and Ciskei, and those foreigners who  acquired  legal  citizenship  of
the country.

The department has indicated that it is  in  the  process  of  appointing  a
project team to deal with the matter and that  it  will  invite  tenders  as
soon as possible. An amount of   R32 million has  been  allocated  for  this
process. We urge the department, when rewriting the population register,  to
pay attention to the details of people's names and surnames.

Secondly, the officials that will be responsible for the whole process  must
pay attention to the issue of date of birth, as people in many  rural  areas
of our country are unable to  access  their  pension  grants  because  their
birth dates are wrongly recorded. This leads to a situation in which  people
are unable to benefit from programmes that are designed to  alleviate  their
plight.

Next year, South Africans from all walks of life will be going to the  polls
for the third time  under  the  new  democratic  dispensation.  We  need  to
mobilise our people to get their ID documents -  those  who  are  first-time
voters and those who, for some reason or  another,  do  not  have  their  ID
documents.

Our people must understand the fact that for them to  access  services  from
any government department, an ID document is crucial.

We also call on Government to assist the unemployed and  the  poor  with  ID
document photos. I must emphasise the point that people must not think  that
IDs  are  only  important  for  elections,  but  that  they  are   important
throughout their lives. Timeframes should be set when a person  applies  for
an ID document, passport or any  other  document.  The  Department  of  Home
Affairs needs to develop a strategy of distribution of  the  documents  once
everything has been done.

We suggest  that  one  solution  could  be  the  parliamentary  constituency
offices and traditional authorities in  areas  where  they  exist.  If  this
suggestion is to be carried forward, rules and regulations  should  be  laid
down as to how  this  is  done.  There  should  not  be  unevenness  in  the
application of rules.

Another important point that I want to raise is the question of security  in
the Home Affairs offices, especially those in rural areas where some of  the
offices are made of corrugated iron. Clearly, there is no  security  and  it
is easy to break into those offices. As a  result,  identity  documents  and
birth certificates can get stolen. The safekeeping of records and  documents
such as these are a core function of the department.

Hon Minister, on several occasions you have made mention of the  point  that
civic services need to be devolved to municipalities. This is of concern  as
some municipalities are financially incapacitated,  and  by  doing  this  we
would be burdening these municipalities. In order for  us  to  do  this,  we
will need an Act of Parliament.

There are about five pieces of legislation that need to be  amended,  but  I
am  only  going  to  touch  on  three  of  them.  The  first  one   is   the
Identification Amendment Bill. The Bill introduces the issue  of  electronic
data capturing and  verification,  which  is  extremely  important  for  the
implementation of Hanis. We urge the department to speed up the  process  so
that the Hanis project can come  into  play.  Hon  Annelizé  will  elaborate
further on the issue of the Hanis system.

Also urgent is the electoral Bill that will deal  with  the  elections  next
year. We urge the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice  and
Constitutional Development to meet as soon as possible and take the  process
forward. The third piece of legislation  is  the  Marriage  Amendment  Bill,
which should also be  hastened  as  the  Bill  seeks  to  establish  control
measures on fraudulent marriages and marriages of convenience.

We will call upon the SA Council of Churches to  assist  the  Government  in
this effort as it is becoming evident that some ministers  of  religion  are
abusing the system for their  personal  gain,  like  making  affidavits  for
foreigners to get South African citizenship fraudulently.

The annual report for 2001-02 of the department states that  the  electronic
document management  system  would  make  information  easily  available  to
authorised individuals at work stations. Yes, hon Minister,  we  are  slowly
moving in the right direction.

The financial state of the Government's printing works  is  unhealthy.  This
has been confirmed by the recent report of the Auditor-General.  The  report
cites the following, and I quote:


  ... there is R138 million, which has been outstanding for more  than  120
  days, and under Treasury Regulations, overdue accounts should be  subject
  to an interest charge.

Also, another important issue regarding the printing works is the use of  an
overdraft  facility  without  authority  from  the  National  Treasury,   as
required by law. We urge the department to follow  the  right  processes  of
the Treasury.

[Chairperson, I would like to talk about child pornography. We do  not  have
such a word in Sesotho. Therefore I would  call  it  sex  with  children  by
adults, which is the most disturbing problem for us. It is  surprising  that
a parent who abuses a child has a conscience at all. We therefore appeal  to
the hon Minister that laws should be more strict, and also  that  the  Films
and Publications Act be amended soon,  so  that  those  who  break  the  law
should be dealt with accordingly.

We also appeal that the Internet should be structured in  such  a  way  that
children cannot easily access pornography.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, one of the most important tasks ahead  of  the
Department of Home Affairs and of the Minister for the next 12  months  will
be to prepare South Africa for its next general election in 2004.

The legislation relevant here is the Electoral Act, Act 73 of 1998.  In  the
1994 election  all  South  African  citizens  could  vote,  including  those
abroad.  Currently  South  Africans  abroad  cannot  vote.   We   have   the
opportunity to correct this problem with the Amendment Act that  is  shortly
being presented in Parliament.

Sir, we live in a global  village.  A  world  where  your  skills  determine
whether you live in South Africa or in  any  other  country  in  the  world.
Thousands of people from Africa, from Australia and  from  Europe  currently
work in  countries  other  than  the  one  which  they  are  a  citizen  of.
Therefore, most countries make provision  for  allowing  their  citizens  to
vote abroad in their electoral Acts.

Belgium had their general election yesterday. The first Belgium citizen  who
voted, lives in Australia and the second one voted from Japan. In  total  16
000 Belgians, currently abroad, took part in the elections by voting at  the
Belgium embassy in the country where he or she is currently residing.

We will all recall how votes were counted in the  state  of  Florida  during
the election of the American Presidency. During that process it was  pointed
out by the observers that votes outside of the  United  States,  counted  in
Florida, could have an influence on the outcome.

The Constitution of South Africa determines in section 19 that  every  adult
citizen has the right  to  vote,  yes,  including  prisoners.  In  1999  the
Independent Electoral Commission lost a court case regarding this  and  were
legally bound by the court to make provision for prisoners to vote.

The question is, why do criminals have the opportunity  to  vote,  but  law-
abiding citizens abroad are not allowed  to  vote?  Must  the  principle  of
South African citizens voting abroad, also first be  tested  in  the  courts
before found unjust?

The counter argument is that it is very difficult, logistically,  for  South
Africans to vote in other countries, and I understand that.  But,  the  fact
is, however,  that  the  law  already  caters  for  all  embassy  personnel,
including members  of  their  household,  to  vote  abroad  at  the  various
embassies. It would take a minimum effort to expand this voting  opportunity
to South African citizens  abroad.  In  practical  terms,  a  South  African
citizen could first register at his or her embassy and then all votes  could
be counted in one province, for example Gauteng.
By making a small adjustment to the current clause 7 of the  Amendment  Act,
we can overcome this problem.

Meneer,  deur   'n   baie   klein   wysiging   aan   artikel   7   van   die
Wysigingswetsontwerp, kan ons hierdie probleem oplos.

Duisende jong Suid-Afrikaners werk tans vir twee jaar in  Brittanje  met  'n
statebondswerkpermit. Daarna keer hulle terug na Suid-Afrika.

Die VF het 'n jeugtak in Londen, wat baie sterk hieroor voel en wat  verlede
jaar 'n versoek gerig het om in Londen te  kan  stem.  Binne  twee  dae  het
hulle 400 handtekeninge gekry van Suid-Afrikaners in Londen wat wil  stem  -
van alle partye. Ons het nie net ons eie mense gevra nie, maar ook u  mense.
Hierdie petisie is deur hulle aan die Adjunkhoëkommissaris  in  Londen,  mnr
Johannes, oorhandig. Die VF het  ook  verlede  week  hierdie  voorstelle  in
Pretoria gedoen.

In my beperkte tyd, wil ek ook 'n  tweede  saak  aanraak.  'n  Fransman,  'n
Nederlander of 'n Belg wat Suid-Afrika as toeris wil besoek, het  tans  geen
visum daarvoor nodig nie. Die omgekeerde is egter nie die geval nie.  As  'n
Suid-Afrikaner België, Nederland of Frankryk wil besoek, het hy 'n Schengen-
visum nodig.

Waarom hierdie diskriminasie  teen  Suid-Afrikaners?  As  u  al  vir  so  'n
Schengen-visum aansoek geprobeer doen het, sal u weet hoeveel moeite,  koste
en probleme dit meebring. Burgers van ander statebondslande, soos  Australië
en Nieu-Seeland, het nie so 'n visum nodig nie. Waarom  het  Suid-Afrikaners
dit nodig?

Ek stel voor dat die Departement van Binnelandse Sake  ondersoek  instel  of
ons weer visums vir toeriste uit hierdie lande kan instel totdat  hulle  nie
meer teen ons diskrimineer nie. Dalk kom ons dán hierdie  lande  forseer  om
hul eensydige diskriminasie op die visumvlak teen Suid-Afrika te verander.

Ek is nie seker of daar Afrika-argumente  daaragter  is,  of  wat  die  rede
daaragter is waarom Australiërs kan gaan, maar Suid-Afrikaners nie kan  gaan
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Sir, we can solve this problem with a very small amendment to section 7  of
the Amendment Bill.
Thousands of young South Africans are at present working for  two  years  in
Britain with a Commonwealth work permit. Afterwards  they  return  to  South
Africa.

The FF has a youth branch in London which feels  very  strongly  about  this
and made a request last year to be able to vote in London. Within  two  days
they gathered 400 signatures of South  Africans  in  London  who  wanted  to
vote, from all parties. We did not only ask our own people,  but  also  your
people.  This  petition  was  handed  over  by  them  to  the  Deputy   High
Commissioner in London, Mr Johannes.  Last  week  the  FF  also  made  these
proposals in Pretoria.

Sir, in the little time at my disposal I would  also  like  to  touch  on  a
second matter. At present a French man,  Dutch  man  or  a  Belgian  who  is
visiting South Africa as a tourist needs no  visa  for  that.  However,  the
opposite is not the case.  If  a  South  African  wants  to  visit  Belgium,
Holland or France he needs a Schengen visa.

Why this discrimination against South Africans? If ever you  have  tried  to
apply for such a Schengen visa you will know how  many  difficulties,  costs
and problems are involved. Citizens from other Commonwealth  countries  such
as Australia and New Zealand do not need such a visa. Why do South  Africans
need it?

I suggest that the Department of Home Affairs  investigate  whether  we  can
reintroduce visas for tourists from these countries until such time as  they
no longer discriminate  against  us.  Perhaps  we  might  then  force  these
countries to change their unilateral discrimination at  visa  level  against
South Africa.

I am not sure whether African arguments are behind this, or what the  reason
is why Australians can go, but South Africans cannot go.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairman and hon Members, Home Affairs is  the  doorway  to
all people through registering their births, marriages, deaths,  travel  and
their refugee status. It is therefore imperative for the department to  come
clean on the execution of these duties.

There is great concern in the public regarding  services  to  citizens.  The
department has set itself the objective of  equipping  citizens  with  valid
identity documents and record their information in the population  register.
One is struck by the  growing  number  of  invalid  identity  documents  the
department churns out. Wrong photo's on individual's ID's,  wrong  dates  of
birth  and  incorrect  spellings  of  names  and  surnames  keep   surfacing
regularly.

What is mostly worrying is  that  it  becomes  an  ordeal  to  the  affected
citizen to have such errors rectified by the department  in  terms  of  time
and cost. Such ineptitude should not occur in a department that  deals  with
the lives of people and has Batho Pele as its ethos.

What is also disconcerting is that the department has set as its  target  to
produce 95% of all passports and identity documents within  five  weeks  and
two months respectively. One wonders who has to produce the  other  5%.  Our
call is that the department should strive for 100% in all they do.

Marriage laws that are in use are antiquated when  one  takes  into  account
the present dispensation. It is unjust these days to have a law that  states
which person of which colour should marry who.

The UCDP recommends therefore  that  Ministers  of  religion  who  serve  as
marriage officers retain their status permanently as long  as  they  are  in
good and regular standing in their churches. A transfer  from  one  area  of
jurisdiction to another in the Republic should only be reported  by  way  of
information  without  the  need  to  produce  a  new  appointment   by   the
department.

As we head for a  general  election  it  will  be  ideal  to  intensify  the
campaign for the provision of ID documents. If that is  mounted,  far  flung
nooks and crannies of this country, where the  most  disadvantaged  and  the
poorest of the poor live, should be visited as  a  matter  of  priority.  We
note, however, what the Minister  said  this  afternoon,  in  terms  of  the
arrangement his department has mounted.

The IEC is doing great work as the custodian of  democratic  elections,  but
it will have to be more independent and  assertive  in  resolving  disputes.
The commission must pronounce without fear,  favour  or  prejudice  on  such
matters. It is unfortunate for  a  Chapter  9  institution  to  say  to  the
courts: ``Make a ruling as long as you don't make us pay for the costs''.

Finally, we congratulate Mr Gilder on his  appointment  as  Director-General
of the department and hope that other departments, some of which  have  been
running without directors-general for over two years, will follow suit.  The
UCDP supports the Budget Vote.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson and Minister.

The aim of this department  as  stipulated  in  the  Estimates  of  National
Expenditure 2003, and I quote:


  ... to protect and regulate the  interests  of  the  inhabitants  of  the
  Republic of South Africa, in respect of their individual status, identity
  and specific rights and powers, and to promote a  supporting  service  to
  this effect,

is supported by the MF.

The above task is  obviously  challenged  by  the  population  dynamics  and
though the system is acknowledged to have a number of loopholes, the  MF  is
confident in its ability to perform efficiently.

The Budget Speech delivered by the Hon Finance  Minister  in  February  2003
was met by public satisfaction. Over the years public  dissatisfaction  with
the  administration  and  service  delivery  of  the  department  has   been
pronounced  quite  loudly  by  the  media.  Lost   identity   and   passport
applications, painstaking hours in queues and documentation errors  are  but
some of the complaints.

However, the MF  has  placed  confidence  in  the  department's  ability  to
overcome these loopholes. Especially through the programmes adopted,  it  is
hoped that the increase in budget  allocation  made  to  the  administration
programme would be sufficient to fulfil this sector's needs.

The MF finds the service to citizens as very important, to  which  efficient
management is a must. It is hoped that the substantial  increase  in  budget
allocation to this programme would  be  utilised  wisely.  Service  delivery
needs to be more visible and alternatives  must  be  administered  to  avoid
delays.

The programme auxiliary  and  associated  services  appear  intact  and  are
supported. The MF wishes the department well in attaining  their  aims  over
this financial period.

The MF supports the Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]
Ms ANNELIZÉ  VAN  WYK:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,
members of the House,  let  me  first  take  the  opportunity  to  thank  my
colleagues within the study group for giving me the opportunity to speak  in
this debate.

Almost 10 years into our democracy, we need to do an  honest  assessment  of
where we stand in achieving a better life for all. Ours is a  constitutional
government guaranteeing constitutional  rights  to  all  its  citizens.  The
basis of citizenship, which enables access to these rights, lies within  the
Department of Home Affairs. It is a matter of serious  concern  to  the  ANC
that, within the Department  of  Home  Affairs,  many  of  the  issues  that
concern us in 2003, remain the same issues that concerned us in 1994.

The Department of Home Affairs  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  the  promotion,
protection and fulfilment of the rights of all citizens of South Africa,  as
entrenched in the Bill of Rights. Our constitutional democracy imposed  this
duty, not on one single political party only, or on the legislature  on  its
own, but on the executive and officials as well. We collectively share  that
responsibility.

The Department plays a central and vital  role  in  Government  meeting  its
stated objectives. This clearly demands commitment, dedication and close co-
operation with other state departments. Within the department, this  demands
a far greater integrated strategic management approach in dealing  with  the
duties of the department. Indeed,  as  the  Deputy  Minister  quite  rightly
stated in the Department's Strategic  Management  Plan,  the  Department  of
Home Affairs' success will be measured through the impact it  will  have  on
the life of South African society.

The hon Maunye highlighted the problems and concerns regarding  services  to
citizens. This is the most basic of Home Affairs' duties, but also the  most
vital. It is the quality of these services that leaves a lasting  impression
with the department's clients, the South African citizens.

In an attempt to address  the  shortcomings  of  outdated  systems  and  its
application, Cabinet  approved  the  Home  Affairs  National  Identification
System, or Hanis as it is popularly known, on 17 January 1996.  Hanis  is  a
computer system intended to replace the  old  manual  identity  verification
process. Automating the process  would  ensure  higher  accuracy  at  faster
rates. A  basic  national  identification  system  normally  consists  of  a
population register, means by which an  individual  can  be  identified  and
verified, and also an ID document. The motivation behind the need for a  new
system is clear. Firstly, the present ID document is frequently  abused  and
open to fraud. Because of that  the  population  register,  which  forms  an
integral part of a national identification system, is corrupt.

Furthermore, in order to produce it, a variety of materials are needed,  and
the  manufacturing  is   time-consuming.   Because   of   all   the   stated
shortcomings, many no longer regard the current  ID  documents  as  absolute
proof of identity.

Despite the obvious need for a new and updated system, the Hanis project  is
entangled in time delays and ado. In  January  1996,  Cabinet  approved  the
system. In December 1996, a comprehensive tender was published. However,  it
was only in January 1999 that a tender was  awarded,  which,  in  turn,  was
only signed in November 1999. During  January  1999,  Cabinet  suggested  an
investigation into the change of  the  Hanis  card  from  a  two-dimensional
barcode card to a smart card. In 2000 the  Minister  launched  the  project.
Shortly thereafter, the card portion was removed from the contract,  pending
an investigation into the smart card technology.

On 25 July 2001, Cabinet approved in principle  the  implementation  of  the
national smart ID card project for the country.  This  smart  ID  card  must
form the platform for  the  integration  of  relevant  government  services,
centred  on  the  electronic   identification   of   citizens   and   ensure
interoperability, common  standards  and  the  elimination  of  duplication.
Furthermore, there will be an  integration  of  Social  Development's  state
pensions payment application onto the smart ID card.

The extended timeline of this project clearly  indicates  serious  problems.
Reasons for many of these delays are unclear and murky.  The  stated  delays
have forced many departments to go it alone, because progress was  slow  and
frustrating. An example of this is the credit card type of  licence  system,
implemented by the Department of Transport. This  application  was  intended
to be part of the ID card. It is important  that  co-operation  between  the
Department of Home Affairs and other government departments be  improved  to
ensure the ultimate advantageous use and implementation of the Hanis  system
for the country and for Government as a whole.

Delays also resulted in  serious  financial  implications  for  the  project
specifically, and the Department of Home Affairs  in  general.  Whereas  the
total project in 1996 was budgeted at R930  million,  a  card  then  costing
R50, now, in 2003, it is estimated that the card component alone  will  cost
more than R1 billion - almost three times the original cost.

Technology is ever advancing. At some point in time the line must be  drawn,
and the project must be implemented. DHA has reached that point  as  far  as
Hanis is concerned. The Department of Home Affairs made a  bad  decision  in
1999 when it decided to remove the card from the  tender  and  the  project,
pending the investigation into a smart card. The card is the driver of  this
project, and in the absence of the driver of the project,  the  project  did
not progress as it should have. The result of  that  decision  is  that  the
department now has a database that costs more than R800  million,  which  is
virtually empty.

Currently,  a  mere  700  000  ID  applications  have  been  captured.   The
department has achieved, as the  Minister  outlined,  an  average  of  6 000
applications records intake per day, but  experience  daily  backlogs  of  5
000. According to the department, this is because of image capture  problems
technology considerations. In the light of this problem, it  makes  the  R17
million roll-over earmarked for equipment to deal with image capturing  that
much more undesirable.

Populating the Hanis database is the  most  crucial  part  of  the  project.
Knowing that the current population register is more than 30 years old,  and
the extent of fraud involved in the  current  ID  documentation,  populating
the Hanis database is a huge  challenge.  Extreme  care  must  be  taken  to
ensure that those with illegal ID documentation are not part  of  the  Hanis
databases.  Failure  to  do  so  would  result  in  legalising  those   with
fraudulent citizenship. This would provide  them  with  access  to  all  the
rights and privileges of  South  African  citizens  and  will  result  in  a
corrupt Hanis database.

The department is currently working with banks and the  Post  Office  in  an
attempt to ensure that the data they are working with  is  life  and  active
data. The ANC would like to make a positive suggestion to the department  to
make use of the voters role for next year's general election  in  populating
the database. This ought to be a trustworthy and  extended  source  of  life
data that can be used in this process.

Despite all the problems, the ANC and Government  remain  committed  to  the
Hanis system. It opens up very exciting  possibilities,  of  which  not  the
least the study initiated by the National Treasury  on  the  possibility  of
the public-private partnership procurement model for implementing  the  card
model. We urge the department to remove all remaining obstacles in the  way,
and to move forward with this process.  This  is  a  critical  component  of
Government's service delivery  and  everything  possible  must  be  done  to
expedite delivery  on  Hanis.  We  will  support  the  department  in  every
reasonable effort to make this a reality.

Lastly, let me address two issues that concern us greatly. The first one  is
corruption.  Reports  on  corruption,  involving  the  Department  of   Home
Affairs, have become a regular occurrence. In the last two weeks there  were
at least two more examples reported in the press. In Umtata four women  were
arrested with fingerprinted ID application forms,  IDs,  birth  certificates
and health cards. An amount of almost R4 000,  used  to  obain  the  illegal
documents, has been confiscated.

The Sunday paper Rapport reports that more than 2 000 unemployed women  from
Port Elizabeth were married during the past year in a scam to  give  illegal
immigrants residence and work permits. Further enquiries to  the  Department
of Home Affairs revealed that his year alone they have  already  received  a
further 2 000 complaints from women who fell victim to these scams.

In Umtata, during a portfolio committee visit, people standing in line  told
us, that they were ``agents'' operating with certain officials. If you  paid
the ``agent'' R20, you suddenly did not have  to  spend  the  whole  day  in
line, but were helped far quicker. Negotiations for a lower fee  was  tough,
because as the ``agent'' indicated, the official must get half of the fee.

Apparently, this fee increases in the urban areas. These acts of  corruption
involve officials of the Department of Home Affairs. We cannot deny  it.  It
undermines the work of  the  honest  officials  within  the  department.  It
simply still seems as if  DHA  is  not  curbing  these  acts  of  corruption
sufficiently. The whole functioning of the  department  is  jeopardised  and
disrupted by every single act of corruption, and by every corrupt  official.
Corruption of this extent indicates a deeply  rooted  problem.  It  must  be
rooted out without exception or favour.

The second issue is the determination of priorities within  the  department.
No single government department will ever say that they are receiving a  big
enough stake of the national Budget.  DHA  is  no  exception.  In  fact,  it
clearly states that many  of  its  shortcomings  are  because  of  financial
constraints. As a portfolio committee, we will be the  first  to  support  a
call for more funds. However, we must indicate  our  concern  regarding  the
determination of priorities in the department. A point in case is  the  huge
amounts of money the department spends on court cases.

A senior official highlighted the extent of this problem earlier  this  year
when he, in response to a question  by  the  portfolio  committee,  answered
that it was  good  for  the  department  to  be  involved  in  court  cases.
[Laughter.] With the available budget, the department  needs  to  prioritise
properly, addressing its core functions first. It needs to  ensure  that  it
spends its limited available resources  where  it  matters.  Corruption  and
unnecessary legal costs are a waste of the human and financial resources  of
the department, and takes away from the service  delivery  capacity  of  the
department.

Ek wil alle Suid-Afrikaners vra om hul deel te  doen  om  te  sorg  dat  die
burgerlike regte wat elke Suid-Afrikaner toekom,  deur  almal  bereik  word.
Daar is 'n positiewe rol vir elkeen om te speel. Maak seker  dat  die  mense
met wie jy in aanraking kom die, regte dokumentasie het sodat hulle  toegang
tot hul regte kan verkry. Meer nog, stel jouself en jou  tyd  beskikbaar  en
word deel van die vrywilligers wat met die ID-projek help. 'n Paar  uur  van
jou tyd kan 'n lewensverskil maak in die bestaan van 'n  mede-Suid-Afrikaner
wat hierdie dienste desperaat  nodig  het.  Word  positief  deel  van  Suid-
Afrika, en help aktief  om  só  die  grense  van  armoede  terug  te  stoot.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I want to ask all South Africans to play their part in  ensuring  that  the
civil rights due to every South African are achieved by everyone.  There  is
a positive role for everyone to play. Ensure that the people you  come  into
contact with have the right documentation to enable them to gain  access  to
their rights. Moreover, make yourself and your time available and  join  the
volunteers helping with the ID project. A few hours of your time could  make
a change in the life of a fellow South  African  who  needs  these  services
desperately. Positively become part of South Africa, and  help  actively  to
push the boundaries of poverty back in this way.]

As I said at the beginning, DHA is an integral part of the service  delivery
of Government. Failure  by  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  hampers  the
service delivery of other departments. The ANC Government will not  fail  in
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. It is  the  only  way  to  provide  a
better life for all our people. This is a promise that  we  have  made  when
freedom was achieved almost 10 years ago. This is what our people expect  of
its Government. This  is  the  very  least  that  our  people  deserve.  The
challenge for the Department of Home Affairs, and all its officials,  is  to
play its important role in achieving this and to be judged by history as  an
agent for improvement, and not an obstacle in empowerment. [Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Agb  Voorsitter,  dit  is  vir  my  vanjaar  'n  besonder
aangename voorreg om as lid van die DA aan hierdie bespreking deel te  neem.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Die eknievallery voor die ANC deur die Wes-Kaapse  premier
en die nasionale leier van die Nuwe NP het my, onder andere,  genoop  om  op
21 Maart die besluit te neem om my gewig by die DA in te gooi.  Die  DA  wil
ons land en die belange van elke inwoner op 'n positiewe wyse  dien  en  ons
onderskryf ook die grondbeginsels soos vervat in ons land se  Grondwet,  wat
in 1996 deur die Parlement aanvaar is. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Hon Chairperson, it is truly a great honour for me  as  a
member  of  the  DA  this  year   to   take   part   in   this   discussion.
[Interjections.] This bowing down to the ANC by  the  Western  Cape  Premier
and the national leader of the New NP compelled me, inter alia, on 21  March
to make the decision to throw my weight in with the  DA.  The  DA  wants  to
serve our country and the interests of every resident in a  positive  manner
and we  subscribe  to  the  basic  principles  contained  in  the  country's
Constitution as adopted by Parliament in 1996.]

The Department of Home Affairs is one of  the  Government  departments  that
has the most contact with the public but this department is  treated  rather
badly by the Minister of Finance. On a friendly note, I would  like  to  say
that I wish to convey my thanks to Minister  Buthelezi,  Mr  Ivan  Lambinon,
who acted as Director-General until recently,  and  the  officials  for  the
service they selflessly rendered under very difficult  circumstances  during
the past year.

At the same time I wish to congratulate the new Director-General,  Mr  Barry
Gilder, on his appointment as head if this  very  important  department  and
offer him our co-operation. At the same time I would  like  to  congratulate
Prof Wilmot James who was  today  appointed  as  chairperson  of  the  newly
established Immigration Advisory Board.

There are many vacant posts in the department and this is one  of  the  main
reasons why the services rendered by the Department are  not  always  up  to
standard. A second but most important reason is the fact that  it  took  the
Government seven months to appoint a new Director-General.

On 21 February  2003  Dr  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi  confirmed  in  reply  to  a
question that there are 1 915 vacancies  in  his  department.  At  the  head
office there are  374  vacancies,  and  in  the  regions  all  together  731
vacancies. I mention some of the regions: In the North  West  there  are  90
vacancies; in Gauteng West, 97; and in the Western Cape, 68.

In the state of the nation speech by the President on 14  February  2003  he
stated that critically important posts in the department were  going  to  be
filled. Further to this, I  put  a  question  about  the  filling  of  these
critically  important  posts  and  he  replied  that  349  posts  had   been
identified and had to be filled. As a result of the  issuing  of  Resolution
7, only 87 of these posts may be advertised; the other  262  posts  must  be
filled by recruiting candidates from redundant staff members in  the  Public
Service. This measure impairs the effectiveness of not only  the  Department
of Home Affairs, but  also  every  department  that  has  similar  problems.
However, the department took the bit between its  teeth  and  the  87  posts
were at last advertised on 25 April 2003 - the other 262 posts have not  yet
been filled.

It is high time that the Government woke up and saw to it that the red  tape
and unnecessary obstacles to effective service are removed.
Voorsitter, in die verkiesing van volgende  jaar  gaan  die  departement  'n
baie belangrike rolspeler wees, veral ten opsigte  van  die  uitreiking  van
die staafkode-identiteitsdokument. Dr Buthelezi het  reeds  aangekondig  dat
die staafkode-identiteitsdokument die enigste  vorm  van  identifikasie  vir
stemdoeleindes in volgende  jaar  se  verkiesing  gaan  wees.  Die  spoedige
uitreiking van identiteitsdokumente is dus van die uiterste belang.

Die  hoofkantoor  ontvang  tans  tussen  8  000  en  10  000   aansoeke   om
identiteitsdokumente daagliks. Hulle  gee  die  versekering  dat  hulle  dit
binne twee maande kan uitreik. Die kontrolering van vingerafdrukke moet  nog
met die hand gedoen word, en dit is 'n tydrowende taak. Dit is  nietemin  'n
uiters belangrike taak, wat met groot omsigtigheid uitgevoer moet word.  Dit
is een van die struikelblokke waarmee die  departement  worstel,  omdat  die
outomatiese kontrolering van vingerafdrukke nog nie in werking  is  nie.  In
hierdie  afdeling   behoort   die   departement   361   kontroleerders   van
vingerafdrukke te hê. Daar is tans 'n tekort van 80.

Daar  sal  baie  hard  gewerk  moet  word  om  hierdie  saak  reg  te  stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Chairperson, in next year's election the department is going to be  a  very
important role-player, especially with regard to the  issuing  of  the  bar-
coded identity document. Dr Buthelezi already announced  that  the  bar-code
identity document will be the only form of  identification  in  next  year's
election for voting purposes. The speedy issuing of  identity  documents  is
therefore of utmost importance.

The head office currently receives between  8 000  and  10 000  applications
for identity documents daily. They give the  assurance  that  they  will  be
able to issue it within two  months.  With  regard  to  the  controlling  of
fingerprints it still has to be done manually and this is  a  time-consuming
task. This is nevertheless a very important task that has to be carried  out
with great care.

It is one of the stumbling blocks with which the department  is  struggling,
because the automatic control of fingerprints is not in place yet.  In  this
section  the  department  should  have  361  controllers  for  fingerprints.
Currently there is a shortage of 80 persons.

A lot of very hard work will need to be done to rectify this matter.]
I should also like to focus on another aspect of the elections and  that  is
the registration of voters. On behalf of the DA I wish  to  make  an  urgent
appeal to the IEC to ensure that the process followed with the  registration
of voters is transparent, fair and just. We  are,  however,  confident  that
the IEC will do everything in its power  to  ensure  that  malpractices  and
corruption are eliminated.

Finally, I trust that if it should appear that the  two  weekends  envisaged
for registering voters at the various polling  booths  are  not  sufficient,
additional time will be made available.

Ek vertrou dat die Regering alles sal probeer doen  om  die  personeelkrisis
in die departement spoedig op te los. 'n  Ander  saak  wat  dringend  aandag
verg, is die dispuut oor die toepassing van die bepalings wat ingevolge  die
Wet op Immigrasie uitgevaardig is.

Sodra die Konstitusionele Hof sy uitspraak oor  die  regulasies  gegee  het,
vertrou ek dat die Regering en  die  pas  gestigte  Immigrasieadviesraad  na
billike kritiek  sal  luister  en  sal  toesien  dat  die  nodige  wysigings
aangebring word.
Die Departement van Binnelandse Sake en die OVK speel 'n belangrike  rol  om
te sorg dat die  grondbeginsels,  soos  vervat  in  ons  land  se  Grondwet,
gereelde en regverdige verkiesings en die bevordering en instandhouding  van
'n veelpartydemokrasie beskerm word. Indien ons  sou  voortgaan  om  hierdie
suiwer beginsels in stand te hou en te koester, sal Suid-Afrika  'n  wenland
bly. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I trust that the Government will try to do everything  in  their  power  to
resolve the staff crisis in the  department  speedily.  Another  issue  that
requires urgent attention is  the  dispute  about  the  application  of  the
provisions issued in terms of the Immigration Act.

As soon as the Constitutional Court has  made  its  findings  regarding  the
regulations, I trust that the Government and the newly  founded  Immigration
Advisory  Council  will  listen  to  fair  criticism  and  ensure  that  the
necessary amendments are made.

The Department of Home Affairs  and  the  IEC  play  an  important  role  in
ensuring  that  the  basic  principles,  as  contained  in   our   country's
Constitution  regular  and  fair  elections  and  the  promotion   and   the
maintenance of multiparty democracy are protected. If we  were  to  continue
to maintain and cherish these pure principles, South Africa  will  remain  a
winning country. [Applause.]]

Mr P M SIBANDE: Chairperson, Ministers, hon members, comrades  and  friends,
first of all the ANC  supports  the  budget.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
gigantic organisation to which I belong -  the  ANC  -  for  its  unshakable
stance and for never deviating from  its  guiding  document  -  the  Freedom
Charter - from which I would like to  quote  the  following  clauses:  ``The
people shall govern.'' The second one is: ``All shall be  equal  before  the
law.'' By quoting the above-mentioned clauses from the  Freedom  Charter,  I
would like to remind the people  from  my  left  that  the  authors  of  the
document are the people themselves who came out in their  numbers  in  1994,
1995, 1999 and 2000  during  national  and  local  government  elections  to
endorse what was adopted during 26 June 1955 in Kliptown.

I would like to use this opportunity again to  remind  my  fellow  opponents
that memories of good things and those of our dynamic leaders are  there  to
stay but not to vanish. At the same time our leaders in the  organisation  I
serve taught us that even with bad  things  that  happened  to  us  we  must
forgive but not forget because that forms part of our history.

Mgcinisihlalo,  ngivumele   ngikhumbuze   ozakwethu   abakhona   kule   Ndlu
yesiShayamthetho  nabo  bonke  abantu  baseNingizimu  Afrika  ukuthi   ubaba
uSisulu  ungomunye  wabaholi  bakaKhongolose  abafaka   igalelo   lokwembula
ukubola  nezenzo  ezinyantisa  umzimba  eMpumalanga,  isabizwa  ngokuthi  i-
Eastern  Transvaal.  Lapho  abamhlophe  basemapulazini   bebebulala   isizwe
esimpisholo benze ngaso umanyolo  wokuvundisa  amasimu  noma  izivande  zabo
zamazambane.  [Ihlombe.]  Abaholi  bakaKhongolose  ngoba   bona   bengayidli
imbumba, yibona abema bathi qingqo  beya  phansi  naphezulu  ukwembula  lezi
zenzo zobudlambedlu.

Phakathi kwabo abaholi bakaKhongolose, ubaba  uSisulu  wayebambisene  nobaba
uNelson Mandela okunguyena owayengummeli, ubaba uGert Sibande  owayengumholi
wase-Eastern  Transvaal,  ubaba  uSlim  Dick  Mtsweni  owagcina   ebulawelwe
eBotswana   ekuhlaseleni   kwezigayigayi    zamasotsha    ayenonya    ombuso
wobandlululo. Angimlibali  ubaba  osadla  amabele,  ubaba  uKhumalo  owaziwa
ngokuthi   uZablon   Dlangamandla   ohlala   eMpumalanga,    owayengusihlalo
wamavolontiya. Ngaleyo minyaka  abantu  baseNingizimu  Afrika  baze  baqamba
ingoma ethi ``Hamba uye eBhetali uyomba amazambane''.

Kukho  konke  okubi   okwenziwa   kubantu   bakithi   abampisholo,   abaholi
bakaKhongolose  abakaze  bathathe  isinqumo  sokuthi  kufanele  abantu  babe
namagqubu  noma  baziphindiselele  kubelungu.  Lokhu   yikhona   okufakazela
isinqumo  esathathwa  kumqulu  weFreedom  Charter.  (Translation   of   Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, let me remind my colleagues in this House  of  Parliament  and
all South Africans that Mr Sisulu was one of the ANC leaders who  played  an
important role in exposing the evil and disgusting acts which transpired  in
the Eastern Transvaal, now known as Mpumalanga.

White farmers in this area used to murder blacks and use  their  corpses  to
produce fertiliser for use in their potato fields and  gardens.  [Applause.]
The ANC leaders would not have that kind  of  nonsense,  so  they  took  the
initiative and made sure that these barbaric acts were uncovered.

Mr Sisulu worked with ANC leaders such  as  Mr  Nelson  Mandela  who  was  a
lawyer, Mr Gert Sibande,  who  led  the  Eastern  Transvaal,  Mr  Slim  Dick
Mtsweni, who was later killed in Botswana in a raid by the brutal  apartheid
soldiers. Among them stands out Mr Khumalo, who  lives  in  Mpumalanga  well
known as Zablon Dlangamandla,  who  was  the  chairman  of  the  volunteers.
During those years South Africans composed  a  song,  ``Hamba  uye  eBhetali
uyomba amazambane.'' [Go to Bethal and dig potatoes.]

In spite of all the evil  that  was  unleashed  on  our  black  people,  the
leaders of the ANC never resolved to bear grudges or  to  retaliate  against
the whites. This bears testimony to the resolution of the Freedom Charter.]

I would also like  to  commend  the  organisation  Sayco  which  became  the
political school in South Africa under the leadership of  the  late  Comrade
Peter Mokaba, Parks Mankahlana, Fawcett Mathebe and others. Sayco  continued
the tradition of the ANC Youth League of the 1940s of the defiance  campaign
hence they (Sayco) were referred to as O R Tambo young lions.  The  defiance
campaign that the youth generation of the Tambos and Sisulus  were  involved
in was to get a common identity document (not dompass) for everyone  in  the
country.

A colleague of mine, a few weeks  ago  during  her  debate,  hinted  at  the
slogan by the late Comrade Peter Mokaba, but  she  forgot  to  mention  that
Comrade Peter Mokaba did not  want  us  as  young  lions  by  then  to  hold
grudges. Instead his dream was to see the people of South Africa, black  and
white, being liberated and receiving a better life and better  education  as
it is stipulated in the Freedom Charter.

Comrade Peter used to refer to Sayco as a bombshell.  In  the  ears  of  the
oppressors they thought that Sayco had bombs. The answer is, no. There  were
no bombs, but he was referring to the power and the  intelligentsia  of  our
youth urging that they must organise and mobilise themselves and speak  with
one voice. Through that spirit of our legends the ANC would  therefore  like
to call on all the youth of this country, black and white, to stand  up  and
assist: firstly, all  young  people  who  qualify  for  social  grants  must
register; secondly, the youth must apply for IDs; thirdly,  to  register  in
the voters' roll; lastly, during elections to go out  in  their  numbers  to
the polling stations to vote to defend the fruits of freedom that were  hard
fought for by the youth of this country. [Applause.]

Hon members, let us look  at  the  current  situation  particularly  in  the
Department of Home Affairs. Home Affairs is a national competence which  all
South Africans are depending on. The transformation  of  the  Department  of
Home Affairs is a key to success to service delivery. It  has  nine  regions
without full capacity as the main challenge facing the department.

With regard to administration, the administration arrangement  still  leaves
much to be desired. For example, it is vulnerable to mischief.  A  practical
case is the following one. Last year, Mrs Betty Sithole, who is a widow  and
a pensioner from Bethal, was unable to receive her social  grant  for  about
ten months because of her  initials,  surname  and  ID  numbers  which  were
exactly the same to those of a certain Mrs Sithole from  KwaZulu-Natal.  The
second point is that the system used by the department is unable to pick  up
some people who are already dead. The third point is that people  are  still
queuing for a long time, others are even turned back  without  being  served
by the officials of the department while others  are  sleeping  outside  the
service station during rainy and cold days hoping to  get  service.  Another
point is that  even  the  department  itself  is  aware  of  the  persisting
inadequate services that are rendered for the deep  rural  and  marginalised
urban communities. The last point is that at eMqanduli in the  Eastern  Cape
the department is operating in the  shack  without  electricity,  water  and
toilets.

With regard to stakeholders, the ANC is  making  a  special  appeal  to  all
traditional leaders from izinkosi, izinduna etc. to let the  spirit  of  the
late  amakhosi  prevail,  such  as  King  Shaka,   King   Sekhukhuni,   King
Ramabulane, King Moshoeshoe, King Hintsa and Chief  Luthuli,  Chief  Maqoma,
Chief Mhlabunzima Maphumulo. All the above-mentioned  amakhosi's  dream  was
to unite and develop our society. Traditional leaders can play a pivotal  in
making sure that Batho Pele Campaign  becomes  a  success  in  their  areas.
Amakhosi are urged to mobilise people for registration in  various  services
as follows: firstly, children  who  qualify  for  social  grants;  secondly,
early birth registration for children; thirdly,  registration  for  identity
documents; fourthly, voters' registration. Note that we also  urge  amaKhosi
to do away with between R10 and R200 stamp fee when people require proof  of
residence. [Applause.]
The issue of staff is another headache. One wonders how  can  one  expect  a
vehicle to cruise smoothly without shock absorbers. Also how  can  a  person
expect  any  positive  production  from  the  department  which  is  run  by
officials who are acting in most portfolios. Since  the  Government  led  by
the ANC took power  nine  years  ago  from  the  apartheid  government,  the
department still has 1 500 vacancies, of note is  that  minus  one  official
...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking  time
has expired. [Applause.]

Mr P M SIBANDE: I thank you.

Mr E  T  FERREIRA:  Chairperson,  there  are  very  few  of  our  government
departments, if any,  who  are  given  sufficient  funding  to  perform  the
services that they are expected to do. No  matter  where  you  go  in  South
Africa, no matter what department you have dealings with, the  problems  are
basically the same. Service which  is  not  always  up  to  standard,  staff
shortages and lack of funds. I know of a lady in Port Elizabeth who  applied
for an urgent domestic violence interdict two weeks ago.  On  day  nine  she
was told by the justice official to be patient, there were not enough  staff
to help her.

As far as the lack of funds is concerned, the Department of Home Affairs  is
unfortunately no exception. In fact it is one of the  departments  which  is
worse affected by this problem. Take into consideration that the  department
nationally has been given R15 million for the new ID campaign.  How  far  do
people think this R15 million will go towards  getting  everyone  who  needs
new IDs their documents. The Director of Home Affairs in  the  Eastern  Cape
has found in a study that to supply everyone who needs ID documents in  that
province  alone  would  cost  R81  million.  There  is  thus  no   realistic
possibility that Home Affairs can supply everyone who needs new IDs  on  the
R15 million that they have been given for  this  task.  It  is  like  giving
someone a R20 note and insisting they buy R200's  worth  of  groceries  with
that R20 note. You can stretch that note as far as you can or until you  are
blue in the face, you will simply not be able to buy  the  R200's  worth  of
groceries for that note.

Under the circumstances the IFP would like to  congratulate  the  department
for doing a good job under very difficult conditions.  A  few  weeks  ago  I
went on a portfolio committee trip to the old Transkei part of  the  Eastern
Cape. It was a joint visit  by  the  Social  Development  and  Home  Affairs
Committees. Only the IFP and  the  ANC  were  represented,  of  course.  The
traditional white parties are seldom  to  be  found  when  you  visit  black
areas. But make no mistake they are first in the  queue  when  it  comes  to
overseas trips. [Laughter.]

The poverty we found in the old Transkei nine years into our  new  democracy
was frightening to  say  the  least.  The  better  life  for  all  that  the
Government has promised clearly does not include the old Transkei  yet.  Mrs
Van Wyk spoke beautifully a little while ago - she is an  excellent  speaker
and I am sure the new party bosses are very happy with the  way  she  spoke.
[Interjections.] I just wonder whether  she  also  saw  the  same  level  of
poverty in the old Transkei that I saw.

We saw a number of both social development and Home Affairs offices as  well
as mobile stations. They were not as well-staffed and resourced as what  one
would have liked, but under the circumstances they  did  a  very  reasonable
job. There were no shortages of forms or ink and most of them had  computers
and printers so that birth certificates could be  printed  there  and  then.
During  the  week  thousands  of  people  were  assisted  as  far  as  birth
certificates and ID applications were concerned.

What was of particular interest was that  although  social  development  and
home affairs have very similar  problems,  the  members  from  the  majority
party only chose to see those of home affairs and chose  almost  exclusively
to complain about them. I suspect in the  report  that  the  committee  will
bring to Parliament soon this will be quite evident. [Interjections.]  [Time
expired.]

Mr M U KALAKO: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, I am  sure  we
were in a different study tour than hon  member  Ferreira.  [Interjections.]
No, the DA must keep quiet because they were not there.

You know, for most of that study tour, he was like a completely lost  sheep.
I do not think that he can give any report  to  his  party.  [Laughter.]  He
never participated in any of the problems of  the  people  that  were  being
dealt with there.

Deputy Chairperson, the African National Congress supports  the  Budget  and
commends the Department of Home Affairs on the successes achieved since  the
dawn of freedom and democracy. The South African Government  has  been  able
to hold two national elections successfully and local government  elections,
all under the guidance and direction of  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs.
These and other achievements of the department to me reflect  some  progress
in the department in fulfilling its mandate. But, I would like  to  raise  a
few areas that I feel the department still has to address.

The Department of Home Affairs,  henceforth  referred  to  as  DHA,  is  the
lifeblood of our system of government.  It  is  through  data  gathered  and
stored  by  the  DHA  that  the  Government  is  able  to   make   equitable
distribution of our resources. The mandate of DHA  is  to  keep  records  of
South African citizens from birth to death. Other government departments  as
well  as  the  private  sector  make  extensive  use  of  this  information.
Therefore, the DHA  plays  a  key  role  in  identity  and  verification  of
citizens, both for the public and private sectors.  Equally  so,  monitoring
of our ports of entry,movement of  goods  and  people  in  and  out  of  the
country, is the function of the DHA.
Having stated the obvious, it is important to assess how  far  the  DHA  has
gone in performing its functions, and evaluate whether it has  succeeded  in
delivering services to the  people  of  South  Africa  as  required  by  our
Constitution. We have to do those things to see whether the  DHA  has  since
1994  to  2003  been  transformed  from  an  instrument  of  oppression  and
humiliation  under  the  apartheid  regime,  an  instrument  to  police  the
movement  of  black  people,  imprison  them  in  their  own   country,   an
institution of divide  and  rule,  segregation  and  racial  oppression.  To
assess whether the mindset of the personnel of the  DHA  we  inherited  from
the apartheid regime, in particular the homelands, have been transformed  to
conform to the new demands of democracy and respect for human rights.

Transformation should not only be judged by how many black faces, women  and
disabled people the DHA has, we should also judge  it  by  asking:  At  what
level do you find these  categories  of  people?  Are  they  represented  at
higher and middle levels of management? What training  is  provided  by  the
DHA in order to improve and enhance their skills level?  Are  there  courses
that they undergo in order to learn how to be a caring public servant -  how
your attitude must  be  when  you  serve  the  public?  We  must  ask  these
questions because that is how the  public  views  and  concludes  about  the
performance of the Government.

From our interaction  with  the  public  as  the  portfolio  committee,  and
listening to the people, the attitude and mindset of the  officials  of  the
DHA leaves much to be desired. Even where there are  enough  resources,  for
example, in cities, morale is low, and there is no  purpose  of  urgency  in
what the staff is doing. We will judge the transformation of the DHA not  by
examples of offices in big cities, but by viewing the state  of  offices  in
rural areas and black townships and whether offices  of  the  Department  of
Home Affairs are within reach of  the  people  in  rural  areas  or  can  be
accessed through public transport.

I know that the DHA in its strategic  plan  of  2003/2004  to  2005/2006  is
attempting  to  address  the  way  in  which  services  are   delivered   to
disadvantaged communities. We commend the Department on  this  attempt  but,
one wonders how informed the DHA is  about  the  plight  of  our  people  in
remote villages in provinces like KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern  Cape,  Limpopo
and so forth, where people have to travel more than 80  kilometres  in  some
cases without public transport, in  order  to  access  the  offices  of  the
Department of Home Affairs. My  colleagues  have  already  dealt  with  this
problem.

The Department of Home Affairs must co-operate and  co-ordinate  with  other
departments for the sake of making sure that services are delivered  to  the
citizens of this country. We know that the Department has been crying  about
the shortages of the budget. We sympathise with the department on that  but,
at the same time, as my colleagues have made a call, we want to call on  the
department to prioritise in its functions to make sure that where there  are
shortages it must give emphasis to rural areas, and villages especially.

Mphathiswa weSebe leMicimbi yezeKhaya, ibuhlungu kakhulu  into  yokuba  uthi
xa ufika kweziya ndawo zethu thina bantu  bamnyama,  kuthi  kuphethe  thina,
udibane  nexhegwazana  elidala  likuxelele  ukuba:  'Mna   ukuze   ndifumane
isiqinisekiso sokuzalwa somntwana wam kufuneka ndisuke apha  kusasa  ekuseni
ndiye  kutsho  eMaqanduli,  nalapho  eMqanduli  ndifike  ndifumanise   ukuba
amaphepha akekho; azikho ezo ziqinisekiso, kutsho kufuneke  ukuba  ndigqithe
ndiye kutsho eMtata. NaseMtata kufuneka ndiphinde  ndilinde  etyhwini  ukuba
andikwazi ukuba ndinyobe umntu ophaya etyhwini okoleka imali  oza  kundifaka
phambili'.  Yintlungu  kakhulu  ke  kuthi  le  kuba  sililwele  eli   lizwe.
Kungakumbi xa isenzeka  kubantu  abangenanto  phaya  ezindaweni  eziziilali,
emaphandleni.   Siza   kulibongoza    ke    iSebe    leMicimbi    yezeKhaya.
Ohloniphekileyo uMnu Ferreira uyaphosisa. Le nto athetha ngayo,  Mphathiswa,
ithi  kwezi  ofisi  zikhona  izixhobo  zokusebenza,  iikhompyutha  neeprinta
ayikho. Ndithetha ngale iseMqanduli kanye ilityotyombe. Phaya usisi  uyedwa.
Sifike  ebila  esitsha  lilanga,  akukho  zifestile,  manzi  nazithoyilethi.
Usebenza ngezandla yaye naye uxhomekeke ngokuya kulanda ezi  zinto  ngaphaya
ziziswe eMtata. Izixhobo ebezisebenza kuzo zonke ezi lali besikuzo  ibihamba
neofisi yomlawuli wesithili nathe  mayithathwe  kwiiofisi  zesithili  eMtata
ukuze    izicelo    zeziqinisekiso    zabantwana    zizokwenziwa    kwangoko
ngokukhawuleza. Andimazi ke uMnu  Ferreira  ke  -  phofu  benditshilo  ukuba
ebesozela elele  phaya,  etshiswa  nalilanga  -  ndibona  ukuba  wenza  into
angayiqhelanga.

Sifuna ke ukucela kuwe  Mhlekazi  ukuba  -  ndiyazi  ukuba  nwe  usuka  kule
ntlalo, uzalelwe apha, yaye sizalelwe kule ntlalo nathi -  ukufumana  abantu
bakuthi  ezilalini  bengakwazi  ukufikelela   nokufumana   izinto   ekufunek
bezinikwe nguRhulumente ngenxa yokuba abakwazi  ukuya  kufikelela  kwiiofisi
zeSebe leMicimbi yezeKhaya. Siza kucela  ukuba  iSebe  eli  kwimali  elinayo
lisebenzisane  namanye  amasebe,  ngakumbi   ...   (Translation   of   Xhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Minister of Home Affairs, it is quite saddening that even though we are  in
power, when you go to the areas where we black people live, you come  across
an old woman who tells you: ``In order  for  me  to  get  my  child's  birth
certificate I have to wake up very early in the morning and go to  Mqanduli,
only to be told when I get there that there are no certificates, so  I  have
to go to Umtata. Even in Umtata I have to stand in the  queue  if  I  cannot
bribe somebody in the queue to push me  in  front  of  him  or  her.''  This
situation is quite saddening to us  because  we  fought  for  this  country,
particularly as it affects people who  have  nothing;  those  in  the  rural
areas. We are going to appeal to the Department of Home Affairs.

The hon  Ferreira  is  not  telling  the  truth.  The  correct  information,
Minister, is that these offices do have equipment, but  have  not  computers
or printers. I'm talking in particular about the one in Mqanduli,  which  is
a shack. The lady worked on her own there. We found her  struggling  in  the
heat there, and there were no windows, water or  toilets.  She  was  working
manually  and  depended  on  others  to  collect  the  necessary  stuff  and
transport it to Umtata. All the equipment that was in working order  in  all
the villages that we visited  was  taken  to  the  office  of  the  regional
manager,  who  gave  the  instruction  that  it  be  taken  there  so   that
applications for  registration  of  children's  births  could  be  processed
speedily. I don't know about Mr Ferreira - indeed I  did  say  that  he  was
dozing off there, struggling in that heat. I could see  that  he  was  doing
something unusual.

We want to bring it to your attention, sir, knowing that you were  born  and
bred in such circumstances, just like us,  that  our  people  in  the  rural
areas cannot access Government assistance because  they  cannot  reach  Home
Affairs offices. We appeal to the department  to  work  hand  in  hand  with
other departments, especially ...] [Interjections.]

CHAIRPERSON: Order! hon Member, your speaking time has expired.

Mr M U KALAKO: ... ngakumbi iSebe leMisebenzi kaRhulumente  ukwenzela  ukuba
zakhiwe ezi ndawo. Enkosi. [Applause.] [... the Department of  Public  Works
so that these offices could be built. Thank you.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Mr Chairperson, hon  members  and  hon  Deputy
Minister of Home Affairs, as I thank all hon members who  have  participated
in this debate, I wish to remind all  members  that  after  this  debate  my
department is holding a reception at the Centre for the Book, on  the  other
side of Parliament in Queen Victoria Street. It is  the  first  one  I  have
ever held, because in all these nine years I was ashamed to hold  receptions
while my department was underfunded. [Laughter.] Yes,  I  am  serious  about
that. [Applause.] The contributions to this  debate  by  members  have  been
very valuable and they will all be taken into account as we deal  with  each
of the issues raised, either administratively or at policy level.

In particular, I wish to ensure  the  hon  Mr  Chauke,  Chairperson  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs, that my department is a leader  in  the
process of transformation, a fact which emerges clearly when  comparing  the
progress made in this direction by my  department  with  the  average  among
other organs of state. I state that we were the first ones to be  given  the
Batho Pele award by Mr Mandela, under the Ministry of Dr Skweyiya.

I am deeply aware of the terrible conditions in which many of our  officials
have to render our department's services. For this reason I have ordered  an
investigation which highlights the fact that deficiencies of this  type  can
only  be  addressed  with  massive  additional   funding,   which   is   not
forthcoming. That is not my fault.

Hence, the need to find a different type of  solution  along  the  lines  of
devolution of the delivery of civic  affairs  to  municipalities  and  other
organs of state and also traditional leaders,  for  instance.  Now  the  hon
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on  Home  Affairs,  Mr  Chauke,  said
that I must come out and tell this House, stating  what  the  role  of  each
structure will be when there is devolution. I am really  surprised  to  hear
the chairperson of the portfolio committee speak in  this  fashion,  because
in my speech today I stated that municipalities and traditional  authorities
are closest to the people and the sensible link between communities and  our
central recording systems. And I stated  that  we  have  done  our  intended
homework regarding this matter, as to what should be done, and at  least  we
can now pursue it at an intergovernmental level.

Because of the inevitable involvement of  so  many  other  stakeholders,  we
cannot go it alone and I urged my colleagues, especially the  Ministers  for
the  Public  Service  and  Adminstration  and  of   Provincial   and   Local
Government, to support me in developing and  rolling  out  the  only  viable
alternative in  addressing  current  unsatisfactory  service  levels.  In  a
democracy I cannot impose my  wishes  and  idiosyncrasies  as  far  as  this
matter is concerned. I must consult other stakeholders, other  Ministers.  I
don't want to wash the dirty linen of my colleagues here in public. That  is
why it has  not  happened  up  to  this  point,  when  I  have  spoken  here
repeatedly about this matter.

The hon Chauke seems not to  be  fully  aware  of  what  the  Hanis  project
entails.  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]  The  Hanis  project  requires   the
building of a very large and complex backbone before a  change  of  benefits
can  be  seen  by  the  public.  And  such  a  backbone  is  the   Automated
Fingerprints Identity System, which contains all  the  fingerprints  of  our
nationals, which is in the process of  being  developed  first.  There  have
been delays in this process because of erroneous strategic  decisions  which
were made at a time when I, as Minister, was not fully informed of what  was
being  done  within  my  department.  I  am  the  political  head  of   this
department, not  the  chief  executive  officer,  so  I  do  not  bear  sole
responsibility. As soon as I discovered it, I immediately  addressed  it.  I
informed the Cabinet on this  matter  and  I  placed  the  process  back  on
course. Once new identity documents are  made  available,  the  benefits  of
Hanis, I think, will be more visible.

We have redirected some of the features of the design of the ID  card  in  a
way which will create enormous savings for the state.  By  taking  advantage
of new and cheaper  technology  based  on  high-density  barcodes,  we  have
limited the utilisation of chips to  specific  categories  of  citizens  who
need them, such as pensioners.

I also need to correct the hon Mr Chauke in respect of the  need  to  appeal
the decision of the  High  Court  relating  to  immigration  regulations.  I
already  explained  to  his  portfolio  committee,  which  he  was  chairing
himself, that such a decision was  legally  necessary,  because  the  status
quo, created by the court order, relied on  the  possibility  of  suspending
the effect of a law adopted by this Parliament. That the  court,  you  know,
could sort of ignore a law passed by this Parliament -  I  could  not  allow
that. I was advised that no court of law can  actually  suspend  an  Act  of
this Parliament of its own accord after it  has  already  come  into  force.
That is unprecedented. That is why there is separation of powers as  far  as
our Constitution and as far as Government  is  concerned  in  this  country.
There are also other  technical  reasons  that  I  fully  explained  to  the
committee, which he chaired ... [Interjections.] Which reasons  he  saw  fit
to ignore. I make an appeal to the chairman  not  to  be  selective  in  his
condemnation of the department's appeal. That style actually fills  me  with
despair, not for my own feelings, but for this country.

It is also not correct that his committee has  urged  me,  as  he  says,  to
adopt regulations in terms of section 7, rather  than  section  52,  of  the
Immigration Act, as the legal advice his own  committee  received  indicates
the correctness of my having adopted regulations in terms of section 52.  In
respect of the receivables of the Government Printer's  office,  the  matter
has already been addressed and  the  level  of  outstanding  debt  is  being
lowered. Measures have been taken to reduce it further in  the  future.  The
Government Printer is also in the process of transformation. We are  now  in
the  process  of  actually  passing  it  on  to  the  Department  of  Public
Enterprises, because that was a decision by Cabinet.

I wish to thank the hon Mr Chauke for the remarks like these  which  I  have
addressed. [Laughter.] Yes, hon members must not think  that  I  only  carry
bricks. I also have bouquets in my pockets. [Laughter.] I  thank  Mr  Chauke
for the remarks he made in relation to the Immigration  Advisory  Board  and
for his remarks relating to  the  need  for  clarifying  the  competence  in
adopting an  electoral  law.  This  other  matter  which  the  hon  chairman
addressed needs to be decided by the parliamentary officials. It is not  for
me to decide.

I wish to thank the hon Mr Waters for his remarks, with which I  concur.  We
need to ensure that the gravity of the problem of child pornography  is  met
by solutions aimed at addressing it, rather than those which make life  more
difficult for all Internet users and providers, without going  to  the  core
of the issue.

I wish to thank His Royal Highness Prince Nhlala Zulu  for  his  remarks.  I
know his position is very difficult, because he is my first  cousin,  but  I
thank him not because he is my first cousin, but because I am  proud  to  be
his first cousin when he performs like this. It is  recognised  that  if  we
are to achieve more, we need to have more resources or find  ways  of  doing
more with less, as we have done with the new system  of  migration  control.
The same approach should be applied to civic services.

I wish to thank the hon Deputy Minister for  her  remarks,  which  show  the
depth of interest  she  has  taken  in  the  department  after  joining  it.
[Applause.] I also wish to thank the hon Mr Pillay  for  having  raised  the
contradictions within my department, which is a product  of  the  moratorium
which was placed on the filling of posts. We are now having  to  work  on  a
very outdated establishment. The fact that  we  are  moving  so  slowly  and
people pontificate here and speak ex-cathedral, like the Pope,  about  these
matters, that is not my fault. [Laughter.] It is not my fault that the  pace
has been slow when moratoriums are imposed. I have to abide by that  when  a
moratorium is placed on us as  Cabinet  Ministers.  I  have  written  to  my
colleague the Minister for the Public Service and  Administration  time  and
time again, to help us deal with these problems or at least  to  remove  the
impairment which exists to our dealing  with  these  problems  ourselves.  I
also wish to assure the hon  Mr  Pillay  that  our  Population  Registry  is
intact and is, in fact, fraud proof, because it is  based  on  fingerprints,
while identity books can be forged, hence compelling the need  to  have  the
new identity cards now linked to the Population Register.

I wish to thank the hon Madikiza for raising the issue of  people  smuggling
and trafficking in people. Just  two  weeks  ago  I  attended  a  summit  of
Ministers from the Southern hemisphere in Bali, Indonesia, dealing  in  ways
to co-operate to eradicate this scourge which is  now,  unfortunately,  also
beginning to affect South Africa. Those were mostly Ministers  from  Pacific
countries and they spoke as if the issue affected only Pacific countries.  I
pointed out to them that this issue affected us as well  insofar  as  people
actually bringing young people from  Pacific  countries  like  Indonesia  to
become  prostitutes  in  Johannesburg.  I  wish  to  accept  the  fact  that
extensive litigation will remain a constant, because it is the flip side  of
the human rights culture to which we as a country are committed.
I wish to thank the hon Maunye,  who  reminded  us  of  the  growing  social
phenomenon of young orphans who have become heads  of  their  households  by
virtue of their having social grants with which they can support  themselves
and  other  members  of  their  families.  My  department  has   prioritised
providing IDs to this class of  citizens  to  facilitate  access  to  social
grants. However, no financial provision has  been  made  to  cater  for  the
increased demand for services. In this respect we  have  already  approached
the National Treasury with a demand for  additional  funds  which,  I  hope,
will be supported by members of this House so that we can  fast-track  child
support grants to children up to the age of 14.  In  this  respect  we  have
also developed a vital  registration  programme  in  co-operation  with  the
Department of Health in 29 traditional authorities, as I  said,  and  taking
the  initiatives.  I  want  to  assure  the  hon  Maunye  that  the  planned
devolution of civic affairs functions to municipalities  will  be  conducted
in accordance with existing capacity. On certain occasions it  will  require
under-resourced municipalities to be provided with capacity which  we  would
otherwise need to build up ourselves so as to address  the  shortcomings  in
our delivery.

I wish to thank the hon Dr Mulder for raising  the  issue  of  our  citizens
voting abroad. I have always believed in a foreign  ballot  paper,  but  the
matter seems to be out of my hands. I hope that the  matter  will  be  taken
into account in the parliamentary process.

I wish to thank the hon Mfundisi for raising the real issue that, at  times,
greater  security  leads  to  greater  rigidity  and  more   difficulty   in
rectifying errors  which  are  bound  to  happen.  I  have  also  noted  his
suggestion  of  eliminating  the  territorial   requirements   of   marriage
officials,  which  I  will  be  canvassing  further  with  my  adviser   and
colleagues.

I wish to thank the hon Ms Rajbally for her remarks, but  I  wish  to  point
out that the budgetary increases to which she made reference are  only  11%,
as I explained, in real terms. I wish to thank the hon Ms Van  Wyk  for  her
remarks  which,  however,  are  factually  erroneous.  While  she  was  very
forceful and eloquent, what she said  was  factually  erroneous,  since  she
stated that the Population Registry is corrupt,  relating  the  problems  of
the identity document to the Population Registry.  That  is  erroneous.  She
should not read the existence of problems into delays in the  Hanis  project
by way of the fact that by heating the bricks we have  avoided  problems  or
carrying a move from what were possibly erroneous solutions to better  ones.
Her correlation to the issue of drivers  licences  shows  that  she  is  not
fully informed about Hanis.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, if you could wind up.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: We will need  to  find  ways  to  provide  the
committee with another full briefing of the matter. I  hope,  now  that  she
belongs to the right party, that in 2004 the President can  appoint  her  as
the new Minister of Home Affairs. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                       Debate on Vote no 29 - Housing:

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Deputy Chairperson, hon  members,  nine  years  ago
the world welcomed South Africa to the community of free nations.  The  dawn
of freedom ushered in a new sense of hope for the  majority  of  our  people
and Africa as a whole. We have travelled a long  way  since  those  days,  a
decade ago, when the old was not yet dead and the new was not yet born.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  members,  those  who  are
leaving, will you please do so quietly without disturbing the  rest  of  the
Assembly.

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, I was saying that we have travelled  a
long way since those days, a decade ago, when the old was not yet  dead  and
the new was not yet born. Those were difficult years, indeed. Today  we  can
point to many successes of transformation. We can point  to  how  we,  as  a
nation, have been forging a new inclusive identity. We can  truly  say  that
hope is alive in South and that the progress that we are  making  says  that
hope is justified.

I am pleased to have been  part  of  a  process  of  transformation  in  the
Ministry which was my home until a few weeks ago. I am pleased to have  been
part of a process of correcting how we see our  history;  ensuring  that  we
reflect more honestly on our past; reclaiming our  dignity  after  centuries
of colonialism and apartheid; and creating new symbols and awards which  are
framed by and express our democratic values as a nation.

We have had many outstanding beacons guiding us on our path over these  past
nine years as we were fortunate to have the brightest beacons  to  guide  us
as we fought to bring democracy to South Africa. It was indeed painful  this
past Saturday to have to say  goodbye  to  a  person  who  was  perhaps  the
brightest of all  those  beacons  which  lit  our  way  to  a  more  caring,
inclusive and democratic society. It was painful to have to say  goodbye  to
our late Comrade and father, Walter Sisulu. But it  was  also  a  moment  to
reflect and look back over the days since Comrade Walter was  released  from
prison on how far we have come as a nation.

The last time that I was called upon to speak in this House was in  my  role
as Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.  Today,  it  is
my duty to present to you the national budget for Housing  for  the  current
year as the new Minister of Housing.  Firstly,  let  me  greet  all  in  the
public gallery who are connected to housing. Let me say ...

... kuni bootata noomama  abakha  izindlu,  namkelekile.  [Kwaqhwatywa  ...]
[... you are welcome. [Applause.]]
Among those present are, of course, my colleagues, the  MECs,  and  I  would
like  to  say  to  them:  Welcome,  colleagues.  [Applause.]  We  also  have
representatives  from  housing  institutions  and   many   other   important
stakeholders.

Let me also take this opportunity to pay tribute to my  Comrade  and  former
Minister,  Sankie  Mthembi-Mahanyele,  for  her  able  leadership   of   the
portfolio of housing. The budget that I present today largely  reflects  the
tremendous strides that have been made  by  Government  in  meeting  housing
challenges of the nation. Perhaps, most importantly, we have  made  enormous
strides together by assisting our people to gain access  to  housing.  Under
her leadership and that of the late Comrade Joe  Slovo,  in  the  past  nine
years, we have seen the construction of almost 1,5  million  housing  units.
We also saw the transfer of 400 000 old municipal houses into the  ownership
of their long-standing tenants. We have therefore seen many homeless  people
and tenants become home owners. That  means  that  this  Government  of  the
people has ensured the creation of secure homes with  tenure,  clean  water,
good sanitation and electricity for, at least, 8 million South Africans.

We have indeed embarked on a great project of renewal, hope and  building  a
better future for all South Africans.  This  is  a  significant  achievement
because it says that we have in the  past  nine  years  provided  assistance
with decent formal housing to a very significant number of  people,  indeed.
Our current backlog is estimated  at  2,3  million  households  which  still
require assistance. The 330 000 further subsidies already approved  indicate
that there is more housing in the pipeline for at least another 1,3  million
people. That is a tremendous achievement by any standards worldwide.

I myself have been able to see  many  examples  of  what  has  already  been
achieved as I have visited a number of provinces during the past two  months
while familiarising myself with the challenges and achievements  of  housing
in South Africa. I can say to the House today that  we  have  reason  to  be
proud of ourselves and particularly of  Minister  Sankie  Mthembi-Mahanyele.
One must indeed agree with the President when he said to this House that  we
have turned the corner as a country and nation.

Allow me at this point to thank those MECs  and  provincial  departments  of
Limpopo, Gauteng, Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga who have  hosted
me, not only for their warm affection  and  hospitality  but  also  for  the
manner in which they have assisted me get to  grips  with  vital  issues  of
housing. I would also like to thank those provinces  which  I  have  yet  to
visit. I am grateful for the dedication  with  which  everybody  is  already
working on those orientation visits.

Today's budget will continue housing's well established approach  of  giving
priority  to  the  reduction  of  poverty  and  vulnerability  and  make   a
meaningful contribution to economic growth especially to the empowerment  of
the historically marginalised groups of our society. We will  also  continue
to respond to the challenges facing those  beneficiaries  with  disabilities
and those living with and affected by HIV/Aids. We  will  continue  to  work
towards the empowerment of emerging  developers  and  contractors  and  help
bring as many women contractors and black  professionals  as  possible  into
the housing sector. This is  one  contribution  that  we  can  make  towards
transforming the industry into a truly representative sector which  is  able
to respond to the country's needs for sustainable housing production.

We aim  to  extend  and  strengthen  our  contribution  to  the  growth  and
development strategy by accelerating our drive towards  the  development  of
SMMEs within the industry. Housing  clearly  has  the  potential  to  create
thousands of jobs and sustainable communities. We  will  continue  to  drive
this process.

We will do so by continuing to concentrate in  the  following  areas,  among
others: promotion of marginalised women in construction by setting aside  at
least 10% of the provincial expenditure for housing projects to  be  handled
by women developers or contractors in  order  to  promote  participation  of
women  in  the  housing  delivery  process;  incorporating  integrated  land
development  and  encourage  all  national  housing  programmes  to  promote
development with all  the  necessary  infrastructure  in  order  to  develop
sustainable  communities;  putting  emphasis  on  a  people-centred  housing
development which focuses on the promotion of the people's  housing  process
- I hear many participants in  this  process  are  present  here  -  whereby
communities indeed are actively participating in the provision of their  own
housing; rural housing that will effectively deal with the  housing  backlog
outside of the cities that  is  31%  of  which  involves  rural  households;
rental  housing  which  is  currently  provided  through  the  institutional
housing  subsidy  instrument  and  has  been  identified   as   a   national
expenditure priority to provide beneficiaries  with  an  alternative  tenure
option; upgrading of  informal  settlements  whereby  housing  projects  are
approved  to  target  the  elimination  of  specific  informal  settlements;
savings linked subsidies to encourage people to save towards  their  housing
developments; housing subsidies  for  the  disabled  and  emergency  housing
needs through  which  provincial  housing  departments  make  provision  for
unforeseen emergency housing needs. We have resolved to set  aside  0,5%  to
0,75% of provincial annual allocations for this purpose.

Most importantly, this budget, once again, recognises that the  emphasis  of
housing delivery in South Africa has moved beyond the issue  of  numbers  to
the enhancement of quality of both our houses and the lives  of  the  people
that we serve.  This  is  important  because  we  must  recognise  that  the
eradication of poverty is not only complex but also  needs  strategies  that
will enhance social upliftment of the poor beyond  the  physical  structures
that we erect.

Indeed, the success of our housing programme will always be measured by  the
strides that we make in pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty  and  expand
access to a better life for all. It is within this context that we  want  to
make this a year in which we build and cement  a  people's  contract  for  a
better future in which all  sectors,  including  communities  and  financial
institutions, play their respective roles in accelerating  the  delivery  of
quality housing for our people.

Houses built with subsidies are currently being enrolled with  the  National
Home  Builders  Registration  Council.  This  is  an  institution  which  is
responsible for ensuring that houses built with subsidies are of a  suitable
design to meet the development requirement of the areas; the application  of
the minimum technical norms and  standards  as  contained  in  the  national
building regulations; and  that  all  building  practices  and  technologies
comply with the stipulated minimum  requirements.  In  addition,  the  NHBRC
will apply its 5-year warranty cover  to  all  enrolled  houses  which  will
ensure that any structural defects  that  may  occur  in  these  houses  are
rectified.

Quality in housing goes hand in glove with the ability to diversify  housing
options and the right of beneficiaries to select the type  of  housing  that
will adequately address their needs. My department  is  in  the  process  of
developing a comprehensive strategy for  medium  density  housing  in  inner
city areas. The programme will cater for new developments  as  well  as  the
refurbishment or conversion of existing buildings. The programme  will  also
cater  for  a  variety  of  design  models  to  suit  the  widest  range  of
affordability levels. The finalisation of proposals is  expected  by  August
this year. The medium density housing development  programme  is  linked  to
the Government's  initiative  to  establish  and  run  adequate  sustainable
social housing institutions in order to create  and  manage  medium  density
housing development projects.

In short, the policy proposes  the  establishment  of  a  sector  regulating
structure  and  a  dedicated  funding  regime  required   to   finance   the
establishment and initial running costs of suitably equipped social  housing
institutions. The social housing Bill  is  also  being  drafted  to  support
medium density housing and will be tabled before Parliament this  year.  The
Bill  provides  for  a  regulatory  body  which  will  be  responsible   for
accrediting social housing institutions and  for  ensuring  good  governance
and sustainability of such institutions. This is because  there  are  indeed
many low and medium-income earners who do not wish to become  tied  down  to
home ownership and  its  obligations.  They  would  prefer  to  take  up  an
affordable rental option which would give them  more  mobility  in  the  job
market.

The  Government  is  therefore  ensuring  that  this  option,  too,  becomes
available.

At the Presidential Job Summit held in 1998 the Government,  private  sector
and labour resolved that there is a need for a  national  presidential  lead
project on rental housing at  sufficient  scale  to  pilot  affordable  mass
housing  delivery  and  alternative  forms  of  tenure,  especially   rental
housing. The presidential pilot project on rental housing was  conceived  to
provide 50 000 rental units in three phases over multiple financial years.

I  am  pleased  to  inform  the  House  that  Government  has  approved  the
institutional and financial models to be used in the implementation  of  the
programme as the way has been paved for the  projects.  This  agreement  has
already led to the appointment of the National Housing  Finance  Corporation
as the management agent for the programme. As a result, the NHFC  board  has
already approved the creation of a specialist unit  within  the  institution
to take responsibility for the implementation of the project. An  amount  of
R225 million in poverty relief funding has already been transferred  to  the
NHFC for the purpose of the partial funding of phase one  to  three  of  the
project.

The three projects selected for the first phase of  the  presidential  pilot
project on rental housing are in various stages of  implementation.  Of  the
three,  Johannesburg  notably  the  Kliptown  subproject   and   Witbank   -
Emalahleni - have already completed their show units. These show units  will
serve the dual purpose of physically launching the presidential  project  on
rental housing and of further enhancing  end-user  processes  such  as  unit
selection based on individual affordability levels.

The first pilot project  for  Gauteng  was  launched  by  the  President  in
Fordsburg last year and it  is  a  true  reflection  of  the  public-private
partnership that we need in  this  programme.  In  Durban,  the  Roosfontein
subproject is being prioritised and it is  anticipated  that  the  remaining
units to be constructed as part of the first  phase  in  KwaZulu-Natal  will
target inner city and refurbishment projects. Business plans for the  second
phase of the project are under the process  of  being  assessed  and  it  is
anticipated that this phase will commence shortly. It is important  to  take
note of the fact that the  presidential  pilot  project  on  rental  housing
supports the shift in focus from numbers to quality.

I am happy to mention that these pilot projects are based on the concept  of
integrated housing development which includes  the  provision  of  community
facilities.  These  projects   will   therefore   contribute   towards   the
densification of existing urban areas and pave the way for the provision  of
lower income housing at medium  densities.  They  will  also  inform  rental
housing policy development aimed at facilitating housing projects that  will
provide rental housing at scale.

Further  challenges  remain,  though,  in  the   area   of   implementation,
monitoring and improving administrative efficiency  as  well  as  realigning
our policy to cater for the  specific  needs  of  the  disabled  and  people
affected by HIV/Aids. During 2002 work continued in relation  to  issues  of
gender equity, the needs of the aged,  and  persons  with  disabilities  and
HIV. We have redesigned our housing subsidy scheme to effectively cater  for
the disabled in order to add the  necessary  features  suitable  for  people
with disabilities. People with  visual  impairment  and  other  disabilities
will get an additional amount on top of the normal  subsidy  to  make  their
homes more accessible and comfortable according to their physical  needs.  I
have  no  doubt  that  by  improving  accessibility  measures  we  will   be
increasing the mobility and independence of disabled people. [Applause.]

We aim to join hands with the Department of Social Development in  assisting
with shelter requirements for areas  where  home-based  care  might  not  be
available. We will also accelerate the upgrading of informal settlements  as
the department has observed that higher incidents of diseases and  infection
seem to take place in this kind of environment.

Our  commitment  to  eradicating  the   backlog   that   we   inherited   is
unquestionable. In order to respond positively to the ever-changing  housing
environment we have decided to continuously review  our  housing  programme.
We initiated a broad consultation process which  included  15  stakeholders.
Workshops  were  held  countrywide.  All  housing  and   development-related
stakeholders had an  opportunity  to  table  matters  of  concern  regarding
housing development. Those were debated in an effort to  formalise  possible
policy interventions or adjustments.

Each  of  the  consultative  initiatives  was   carefully   documented.   My
department is using the results  as  a  basis  to  identify  and  develop  a
research agenda for our medium-term policy. This  will  lead  to  a  housing
summit which we, unfortunately, had to delay  as  a  result  of  the  recent
changes in the Ministry. The results will  also  inform  provincial  housing
development plans and ultimately it will culminate in  the  finalisation  of
the national housing multi year development plan.

In order to ensure a better quality of life for all South Africans, we  will
continue to monitor the home building industry  to  ensure  compliance  with
the transformation requirements  of  the  Constitution  and  other  relevant
legislation. Despite the efforts that we  are  making  to  try  and  provide
affordable  housing  to  the  poor,  we  still  have  to  ensure  that   all
stakeholders effectively play their respective roles. The  reality  is  that
we still have millions of people who are so poor that  they  cannot  acquire
their housing without external assistance. It is in  this  context  that  we
feel that access to finance  remains  the  greatest  challenge  to  low-cost
housing development. The Government  is  therefore  obliged  to  create  the
necessary environment to address this situation. The  restructuring  of  the
financial sector is a necessary priority.

As part of this restructuring, we promulgated the  Home  Loan  and  Mortgage
Disclosure Act in the year 2000. The Community Reinvestment Bill is sure  to
be passed into law in the course of this  year.  Whereas  the  Act  requires
financial  institutions  to  disclose  lending  information,  the  Community
Reinvestment Bill provides for actual targets which  financial  institutions
will  have  to  meet  in  complying  with   their   community   reinvestment
obligations.

The Bill, like the Home Loan and Mortgage  Disclosure  Act  makes  provision
for financial institutions to be rated on  their  performance.  The  targets
will be set after consultation with  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the
financial institutions. The process for the establishment of the  office  of
disclosure has been initiated and is expected to be completed  in  the  next
few weeks.

As part of broadening access to housing finance, we are currently trying  to
inculcate a culture of savings. This campaign has already  yielded  positive
results since the programme was launched by Deputy President Jacob  Zuma  in
2001. As part of further enhancing the programme, my  department  is  at  an
advanced stage with the development  of  a  savings-linked  housing  subsidy
scheme that will further assist beneficiaries to  save  their  contributions
in a structured, dedicated and well-managed way. It is  envisaged  that  the
scheme will be introduced during the coming month or so.

In line with Government's commitment to improving the quality of  subsidised
houses, the subsidy grant has been adjusted. This is also in line  with  our
objectives of  ensuring  that  quality  houses  are  delivered  through  the
housing  subsidy  scheme  which  includes   the   principle   that   subsidy
beneficiaries must contribute towards achieving access to  the  benefits  of
the  housing  subsidies.  The  objective  of  this  is  to  ensure   subsidy
beneficiary participation in the solution of their housing  needs;  that  an
environment is established which instils a culture of savings; and that  the
value of the assets provided through the housing subsidy are realised.

To ensure that the indigent category  of  beneficiaries,  those  who  cannot
participate in the construction of their own houses or who do not  have  the
necessary  means  to  pay  the  required  financial  contribution,  are  not
prejudiced Government has decided to allocate enhanced  subsidies  to  these
groups. This is a clear indication that  ours  is  a  budget  which  assists
those who are in need of housing and have some income. But, it is more of  a
budget which focuses state resources to the poorest of the poor.  To  ensure
that these minimum technical requirements that  now  apply  to  the  housing
subsidy-financed houses will  be  achievable  on  a  continuous  basis,  the
housing subsidy has been reviewed. We have decided  to  adjust  the  subsidy
grant on an annual basis to ensure that the subsidy is  not  eroded  by  the
effect of inflation.

I am confident that this  new  dispensation  will  ensure  the  building  of
quality houses which will be considered by the beneficiaries as real  assets
that will improve the quality of their lives. One way it does so is  through
this Housing Vote which will allow us, as never before,  to  make  resources
available to individuals and families as they go  about  creating  permanent
homes. In this context, it gives me great pleasure to announce that we  have
again managed to raise subsidy levels  for  those  who  qualify.  These  are
significant raises. We are able, in fact, to say that the subsidy will  this
year mean more spending power in real terms. This is  also  a  new  approach
which will see the subsidy increase  annually  to  counter  the  effects  of
inflation.

The new subsidy levels are as follows. For recipients earning 0  to  R1  500
the subsidy will rise by R2 800 from R20 300 to R23  100.  [Applause.]  That
is an increase of 13,8%. Then, beneficiaries who earn R1 501 to R2 500  will
get a R1 500 increase which will move their subsidies from R12  700  to  R14
200. This is an  increase  of  11,8%.  [Applause.]  In  the  income  bracket
between R2 501 to R3 500 the subsidy rises from R7 000 to R7  800.  That  is
an increase of 11,4%.

The indigent who include the aged, disabled and  the  health  stricken  will
have their subsidies increased from R22 800 to R23 100  provided  they  earn
no more than R800 per month. The consolidation subsidy for earners up to  R1
500 rises from R10 900 to R12 521 and for indigents  from  R13  400  to  R15
000. These increases are by 14,8% and 11,9% respectively. [Applause.]
What becomes crystal clear when one  looks  at  these  figures  is  that  we
remain absolutely consistent in our commitment as  Government  to  focus  on
assisting the poorest of the poor. The largest increases both in  percentage
and monetary terms are once again going to those  of  our  people  with  the
lowest income. My department has  already  been  tasked  with  investigating
lifting the income limit for the highest subsidy amount from R1  500  to  R1
794 which is currently defined as the minimum living level.  I  will  report
to Parliament when we have investigated this matter.

Within our concern for transforming the lives of poor  people,  the  subsidy
increases that I announced today continue to be based on the principle  that
subsidy beneficiaries must contribute towards their  own  housing.  We  want
them to do so either through savings or sweat equity. Our  aim  must  be  to
combat dependency and its twin sister, disempowerment, in  favour  of  self-
sufficiency and its twin sister, a real sense  of  responsibility  not  only
for individual housing but also  for  the  country.  Self-sufficiency  means
self-worth. That means, for all of us, national pride. This is  how  housing
can contribute to real empowerment and sustainable development.

In one of my orientation visits to the provinces I  met  a  group  of  women
from Phillipi ... [Time expired.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms Z A KOTA:  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Minister  of  Housing,  Comrade  Brigitte
Mabandla, Ministers and members  of  Parliament,  our  MECs,  the  Director-
General of Housing, Ms Mpumi Nxumalo and  your  team,  distinguished  guests
from the housing industry, oomama abaphaya phezulu [the mothers who  are  up
there], it is a great honour  and  privilege  to  speak  on  this  important
Budget Vote.

Allow me, Deputy Chairperson, to preface my debate by  thanking  the  former
Minister of Housing, Comrade Sankie  Mthembi-Mahanyele,  for  having  served
this housing Ministry with a single mandate  dedication.  Through  her  hard
work the long road of restoring the dignity of our  people  has  begun.  She
has worked hard in shaping and implementing the policies of  our  Government
and the ANC's vision of ensuring a better life for all, not  forgetting  the
foundation laid by Comrade Joe Slovo in this department.

Our new Minister of Housing has shown courage and commitment to  deliver  to
our people what her predecessor, Comrade Sankie  has  started.  We,  as  the
portfolio committee, have confidence and knowledge that  with  her  guidance
and track record we shall overcome any obstacles.

The theme of our debate in this Budget Vote  is  `The  role  of  housing  in
pushing back the frontiers of poverty'. The Budget Vote before  us  presents
us with a number of challenges. The accepted level of underspending  of  all
departments is 5%. But we have noted, with concern, that  this  department's
underspending is  24%.  This  is  indeed  unacceptable,  given  the  present
backlog in terms of housing.

I do not want to indulge into the reasons for not spending  at  this  stage,
but there is one area that we cannot be silent  on,  namely,  the  provinces
which do not  spend  their  budgets.  Some  of  these  provinces  have  been
experiencing  underspending  since  the  beginning  of  the  financial  year
2001/2002. The portfolio  committee  will  take  this  matter  up  with  the
relevant MECs. I do want to commend  those  MECs  who  have  utilised  their
budgets, namely, Limpopo, Northern Cape, Western Cape and North West.

However, we have noted the symptoms of poor planning  in  that  there  is  a
tendency in some provinces to accelerate the spending of  their  budgets  in
the last two months of their financial year, namely, in February and  March.
We urge the provinces to refrain from this practice in future.

It is now nine years since this  Government  has  embarked  on  the  housing
programme which is directed  at  improving  the  living  conditions  of  the
poorest of the poor. More than 1,5 million houses have been built. At  least
two million people have benefited from the transfer of ownership of 398  000
houses to their residents. Our Government prioritises housing as one of  the
key focal points of delivery. It is for this reason that the housing  policy
has as one of its cornerstones the principle  of  labour-intensive  building
methods and employment creation as well as  sustaining  existing  employment
opportunities.

As a result of this  the  housing  delivery  projects  have  a  high  labour
turnover component. Most important of all is indeed the fact that the  major
part of employment opportunities provided through the  housing  projects  is
for semi-skilled  or  unskilled  labourers.  This  enables  the  downtrodden
masses of our people to get jobs in order to improve their wellbeing.

According to the strategy statement from the  department,  it  is  estimated
that approximately  300  billion  has  been  spent  annually  by  Government
through  its  housing  subsidy  scheme  and  has  sustained  45  000  direct
employment opportunities in the  building  industry.  Linked  to  this,  are
about 43 000  indirect  job  opportunities  in  the  building  industry  and
component markets which the housing  programme  sustains.  It  is  for  this
reason that I welcome the ongoing consultations between  the  Department  of
Housing and the Department of Public Works with regard  to  the  empowerment
of emerging contractors.

It is indeed a fact that emerging contractors  tend  to  make  use  of  more
labour-intensive methods and therefore create more jobs  than  the  capital-
intensive larger construction companies. Their increasing  involvement  will
therefore not only serve in their own development but will increase the job-
creation potential through the housing delivery process.

Within the spirit of pushing back the frontiers of  poverty,  provinces  are
expected to set aside 10% of their budgets for the  purposes  of  empowering
women contractors. It remains to be seen to what extent provinces have  been
able to implement this mandate. I do know that in the Western  Cape  Comrade
Nomatyala has been able to do so. [Applause.] There  are  women  contractors
in the housing industry and they  have  proved  to  be  very  competent  and
reliable. This was also echoed by Nurcha when it came before  the  portfolio
committee.

When one speaks about the progress this Government has made in the  delivery
of houses, it is critical  that  one  highlights  the  challenges  that  lie
ahead. The existing backlog cannot be underestimated. Numerous fires in  the
informal settlements such as  Langa,  Wallacedene  and  elsewhere  in  South
Africa are a constant reminder and a demonstration of an acute  shortage  of
proper housing to the poorest of the poor. I  want  to  emphasise  the  fact
that our policies are geared to help  all  South  Africans  who  qualify  in
terms of the legislation, those in  the  urban  areas  and  those  in  rural
areas.

Mhlalingaphambili,  ndifuna  ukuthi  abantu  banelungelo  lokufumana  uncedo
ngezimali (subsidies) nokuba basemaphandleni okanye ezidolophini.  Mayiphele
le nto ithethekayo  yokuba  uncedo  ngezimali  lufunyanwa  kuphela  ngabantu
abasezidolophini. Ooceba emaphandleni mabancedise ekwenzeni  okokuba  abantu
bafumane uncedo ngezimali. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, people are entitled to receive subsidies whether they live  in
rural areas or towns. This idea that subsidies can only be given  to  people
living in towns and cities  must  stop.  Councillors  in  rural  areas  must
people to access these subsidies.]

Between 1994 and 2003 as much as 93% of  all  subsidies  approved  were  for
maximum subsidy which involved households with incomes  between  R0  and  R1
500. We do welcome the increase, announced by the  Minister  today,  of  R23
100. This shows very clearly that this Government is committed to  improving
the plight of the poor with limited resources. The challenge  is  that  more
than two million people, who are potential householders,  qualify  for  this
subsidy in terms of the law  and  are  not  catered  for  due  to  budgetary
constraints.
However, I must also cite the level of corruption that exists which  impedes
the  process  of  delivery.  There  are  beneficiaries  and  officials  that
continue to sell RDP houses.  This  cannot  be  tolerated.  We  welcome  the
investigation by the Minister of Housing into the corruption in the  housing
delivery.

Abantu mabayeke ukuthengisa  izindlu.  Ezi  zindlu  zinikwa  abantu  abafuna
izindlu. Abangazifuniyo izindlu mabangazenzi  izicelo  zazo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
Ukuba  sikhe  safumanisa  okokuba  kukho  abantu  abathengisa  izindlu,  abo
abasokuze baphinde babuye bayifumane indlu kulo Rhulumente. (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[People must not sell house. These houses are given to peole who need  them.
Those who do not need houses should not make request for  them.  [Applause.]
Should we find that there are people  who  are  selling  houses,  they  will
never receive houses again from this Government.]

Chairperson, the department's target is to build 200 000 houses every  year,
and at present it is only able to build between 160 000 and 178  000  houses
per year. The other  contributing  factors  to  the  backlog  is  population
growth, migration, underspending by provinces as well  as  the  capacity  at
local government level. To illustrate the  magnitude  of  the  problem,  two
weeks ago a member of the community came to my office,  in  my  constituency
in Langa in the Western Cape, enquiring about her position  on  the  waiting
list. I phoned the provincial office on her behalf. Her file  was  retrieved
and I was told that, as she applied in March 2002, she is very  far  in  the
list and that they were only dealing with the waiting list of 1987. That  is
the reality that we are confronted with as South Africans.

Our responsibility as patriotic citizens  from  all  walks  of  life  is  to
unleash the potential of our people  as  they  continue  to  participate  in
large numbers  in  campaigns  that  are  aimed  at  improving  their  living
conditions. It is clear that these masses of  our  people  are  heeding  the
call of Tirisano, Vukuzenzele which was made by our President. Let  us  hold
hands and work together towards a brighter future.

Our difficult moments should be seen as the  battle  ground  of  ideas  that
leads us to a better tomorrow. When our people participate in  the  building
of their own homes they come up with bigger houses of not less  than  50  m2
and better quality than those houses built by the developers.
Malunga nezi zindlu  zakhiwe  ngabaphuhlisi  (developers),  abantu  mabayeke
ukusayina iileta ezichaza okokuba banelisekile  bengazibonanga  okokuba  ezi
zindlu zinjani na,  okokuba  azinazintanda  kusini  na.  Ube  usayina  ileta
echaza  ukwaneliseka.  Uyisayinela  ntoni  loo  leta  echaza   ukwaneliseka?
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Regarding the houses that have been built by developers, people  should  be
aware not to sign letters stating that they are satisfied with them  without
having seen whether they are of standard quality.  People  should  not  just
sign.  Why  would  you  sign  thereby  accepting  that  you  are  satisfied?
[Applause.]]

Deputy Chair, the existing backlog also indicates  the  correctness  of  the
position of our Government that the provision of housing cannot be the  sole
responsibility of the Government.  We  do  need  partnerships.  The  private
sector, especially the financial institutions, need to  come  on  board.  We
welcome the fact that the Minister will continue to engage  with  the  banks
on a range of issues, from bad debts, redlining and subsidy-linked bonds.

The National Housing Finance Corporation, a housing institution  created  by
the Government,  has  availed  R1,5  billion  to  the  Intermediary  Finance
Institution so that they can assist emerging contractors in the building  of
houses. The building of houses has  a  potential  of  bringing  about  basic
infrastructure to our communities. Through housing  people  have  access  to
piped water, through housing people have access  to  land;  through  housing
people have access to electricity; through housing  people  have  access  to
health; through housing people have access to  vegetable  gardens  for  food
security and so on.

The central challenge is to provide synergies  in  the  provision  of  these
services; a need to align our delivery process  in  order  to  maximise  our
impact; to avoid incidences where houses are built and there are  no  roads,
no schools, no clinics and no electricity, but most of all, no water, as  it
is in Stinkwater in the North West. Our  government  policies  have  created
conducive environment for this purpose with the introduction of IDPs.

Section 26 of our Constitution states  that  the  national,  provincial  and
local  government  has  a  responsibility  through  legislative  and   other
measures within available resources to achieve  progressive  realisation  of
the right to have adequate housing for all citizens. The  Housing  Act,  Act
107 of 1997, in section  3,  gives  that  responsibility  to  the  province.
Section 9 instructs local government to do likewise. The  Municipal  Systems
Act of 2000, section 23, subsection  1,  says  that  the  municipality  must
undertake developmentally oriented planning referred to as the  IDP  in  the
provision of housing.

It is for that  reason  that  the  portfolio  committee  has  shown  a  keen
interest in the creation of IDPs. That is why we are inviting the  executing
mayors to come before the portfolio committee. Our major concern is  whether
all municipalities have developed the indigent policy so  as  to  deal  with
this issue of water and rates. Our major  concern  is  with  regard  to  the
category of the people we are providing houses to and the  issue  of  child-
headed households which remains a challenge to all levels of Government.  We
do congratulate the Durban Municipality that has reported to  us  that  they
have designed the policy.

I would like to thank the Minister, Comrade Mabandla,  for  inviting  me  to
the Northern Province. It is clear to me that  there  is  delivery  in  that
province, especially in the rural  areas.  I  also  want  to  thank  Comrade
Nomatyala for joining and hosting us in the Western Cape during  the  visit.
We are looking forward to be hosted by Comrade Paul  in  Gauteng  in  August
and by the Eastern Cape in July.

Lastly, I would like to  thank  the  Director-General  of  housing  for  her
sterling work in the department. Also, I want to  thank  the  members,  from
all parties, in the Portfolio Committee of Housing,  for  their  hard  work.
Together we can make things happen. I  thank  you.  The  ANC  supports  this
Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Deputy Chair, the DA  would  like  to  congratulate  the  hon
Minister Brigitte Mabandla on her maiden speech as Minister of  Housing.  We
wish you well in your future endeavours, Minister. You also seemed  to  have
instigated a uniform for the ladies on the Housing Committee. We are all  in
red and black. [Laughter.]

The DA maintains that with  housing  policies  aimed  at  the  provision  of
formally constructed housing, it will be  impossible  to  meet  the  housing
backlog in the foreseeable future. The millions of people who  still  remain
homeless, despite  intensive  construction  over  the  past  few  years,  is
evidence of the enormity of the problem.

Government can be proud of the fact that more than 1,46 million houses  have
been built since 1994. However, there is still a backlog of over  2  million
particularly in urban areas such as Gauteng and the Western Cape.

It would also appear that housing delivery has slowed down in all  provinces
for a number of reasons  including,  slow  and  tedious  land  transfers  to
municipalities, uncooperative traditional leaders and  the  introduction  of
the R2 479 beneficiary contribution not being properly factored.

I would agree with the Chairperson of the Housing Committee that  the  money
budgeted by the  department  is  not  the  problem,  in  fact  most  of  the
provinces are underspending their budgets. It was reported  last  week  that
the Eastern Cape with a budget of R1,1 billion  available  for  housing,  is
expected to spend only R500 million,  less  than  half  of  their  allocated
budget. Most of this is  blamed  on  the  fact  that  there  is  a  lack  of
appropriate capacity in municipalities and unfunded mandates  are  sometimes
used as a basis for not getting involved.
The DA would not just confine capacity building to  the  municipalities  but
extend  it  to  socio-institutional   capacity   building   involving   non-
governmental organisations and community organisations which complement  and
supplement state capacity in the delivery of housing.

The DA believes that if more  people  were  given  access  to  housing,  the
subsidy must be made to work more productively. We  propose  separating  the
provision of shelter, which is an immediate  priority  and  formal  housing.
The present delivery  environment,  whilst  enabling,  is  not  sufficiently
tweaked to the various conditions and needs in the different provinces.  The
DA would support a phased delivery approach like the Mayibuye  programme  in
Gauteng which offers serviced sites and houses built by the Peoples  Housing
Process. As in all schemes of this nature, houses built via the  cooperative
method bypass labour costs with the result that the houses  are  bigger,  of
better quality, individually planned and thus  more  aesthetically  pleasing
on the eye, than the rows and rows of little boxes that  we  presently  see.
This would also fast-track delivery.

The problem with the beneficiary contribution has already been pointed  out.
While the DA agrees that a contribution of this  nature  gives  a  sense  of
ownership and helps prevent a culture of entitlement, it would  appear  that
not much thought was given by the Department of Housing as to exactly ...

DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order,  please!  Order!  Carry  on,  hon
member.

... how the contribution will work and who would collect it. The  fact  that
the subsidy in future will be increased on an  inflationary  basis  is  much
appreciated by the DA, Minister, but we would like to  suggest  that  future
increases are applied across board. What I mean by this,  is  that  in  many
large housing schemes it often take a few years before all  the  stands  are
sold and the development is then retarded due  to  the  fact  that  building
costs have escalated while the scheme is being funded on subsidies  approved
a few years ago.

The DA supports the objectives of the Community  Reinvestment  Act.  Finance
for housing must be made available to  lower-income  earners.  However,  the
first draft of the Bill caused immense consternation as  it  was  felt  that
the recommendations contained therein undermined the financial stability  of
the banking sector. These concerns must be addressed if  the  objectives  of
the CRA are to succeed. The question of  affordable  housing  and  financing
calls  for  creative  public-private  partnerships  between  Government  and
business. It does not require the heavy hand of coercion  and  the  new  CRA
must steer clear of imposing unrealistic  burdens  on  the  banking  sector.
Where possible, efforts of the banking sector  in  this  regard  could  form
part of the BEE contributions in the financial services sector.

The dire  shortage  of  rental  housing  is  well-known.  The  Appeal  Court
decision regarding the Prevention of  Illegal  Eviction  From  and  Unlawful
Occupation of Land Act has further exacerbated  the  problem.  The  Minister
would be aware that I submitted a Private Member's Bill in this  regard  and
in reply to a recent question, she committed herself to having the  relevant
amendments to the Act brought before the portfolio  committee  within  three
months. I was dismayed on recently receiving a programme of the  committee's
activities to see that these amendments are only scheduled for October  this
year. Please, Minister, would you see  if  you  could  speed  things  up  as
promised in view of the serious affect this is having on the rental  housing
market?

Corruption remains a problem and we  are  pleased  that  investigations  are
being instigated in this regard especially by the  DA  MEC  for  Housing  in
KwaZulu Natal with remarkable success. [Interjections.] A case was  recently
brought to my attention where a low-income earner purchased a  vacant  stand
in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, and while the full price was  paid  two  years  ago,
transfer has only just taken place and that after a lot of pushing.  When  a
third party enquired whether interest would be paid on the money  held  over
the two year period, she was told by the attorney that the  purchaser  ``had
not asked for interest''. This is absolutely unacceptable. I  would  suggest
that the larger proportion  of  the  budget  be  earmarked  for  educational
purposes, not only for first time homeowners in regard  to  maintenance  and
other financial responsibilities but also as  to  their  rights  as  housing
consumers.

Problems are also experienced at the upper end of the market.  the  National
Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC) set up by Government  to  protect
housing consumers against shoddy workmanship, a measure we in the  DA  fully
support, has in some cases overstepped its mandate. Several cases have  been
brought to my attention where genuine homeowner builders  have  been  forced
to register with the NHBRC even though they are not legally required  to  do
so. Such owner builders, even if they experience problems  with  homes  they
have built  themselves,  are  hardly  likely  to  apply  to  the  NHBRC  for
compensation under the warranty scheme.

Finally Minister, I am sure that you are well  aware  that  many  people  in
informal settlements would  rather  have  jobs  than  houses.  You  are  not
responsible for the economic growth that would make  this  possible  but  in
the meantime  we  need  to  look  at  more  innovative,  cost-effective  and
environmentally friendly housing alternatives that would  speed  up  housing
delivery to the nation. Thank you.

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, Minister, we all know that few issues  of  national
interest and importance are as emotive as housing.  At  their  Western  Cape
conference on Saturday, members of the IFP youth brigade in Gugulethu  spoke
on a range of matters relevant to them. High on the agenda was, as they  put
it, the degradation of the bucket system and that RDP houses were,  as  they
called it, `unAfrican'. There is no doubt that their  views  are  shared  by
other youth, their parents and their extended  families  across  the  party-
political spectrum throughout South Africa.

The old saying that ``the home is where the heart is'', really  rings  true.
The IFP supports this Vote, not because we believe that it is  adequate,  as
you well know, for the growing needs of the  homeless  and  migratory  South
Africans, or that we are blind to the problems  that  face  the  department.
The  fact  is  that  much  has  been  achieved  in   very   very   difficult
circumstances. We have been  encouraged  today  Minister  by  your  numerous
announcements.  Specifically  related  to  the   establishment   of   sector
regulatory structures and the recognition that the quality of housing is  as
important, if not more so, than mere numbers.

We are really encouraged by your very positive remarks in  this  regard.  We
also applaud your announcement that housing subsidies are to  be  increased,
and we share your previously stated remarks concerning problems relating  to
the banking sector. We wish  you  well  in  trying  to  break  through  that
impasse. As we know, problems relating to the access to land  and  obtaining
land for housing is also a huge problem which you are having to  deal  with.
We recognise existing realities and we acknowledge that your  department  is
beset with issues not of your own making, which regrettably  impact  on  the
majority of Government policies and programmes, housing included.

Matters relating to capacity and corruption, appear to be  a  golden  thread
that weave their way through the majority of the debate we  are  hearing  in
this  House  on  budgets.  Maladministration,  fraud,   theft,   and   other
irregularities  continue  to  plague  departments,  not  only   yours,   and
specifically in housing relating to the subsidy schemes,  the  illegal  sale
of RDP homes, as we read about  in  the  Western  Cape,  to  gangsters,  has
caused a huge worry.

We can only urge you to  attempt  to  reinforce  your  department's  special
investigative task team, to enable it to ruthlessly crack down  on  all  who
see this Government's housing programmes as fair  game  for  ruthless  self-
enrichment at the expense of the poorest of the poor. We fully  concur  with
the viewpoint  that  access  to  housing  and  secure  accommodation  is  an
integral part of Government's commitment to reducing poverty  and  improving
the quality of our citizens' lives. Yet we all know that there  is  more  to
it than that.
Personal, family and community needs are at the heart of  it  all,  and  not
just roofs over people's heads. We have built hundreds of thousands  of  RDP
homes that many people say they don't like. Many are poorly constructed,  we
know that. Houses with toilets only a few feet from  kitchen  sinks.  Houses
where families of adults and youths are  forced  to  sleep  cheek  by  jowl.
Houses with no land for additions or little scope for alterations.

We are told we are building unAfrican homes, which will  not  encourage  any
sense of care for them, or by their very nature in  high  bulk  environment,
little sense of pride and community spirit. We also really need to  look  at
the accompanying much-needed parks, churches and  community  centres,  which
seem to be absent from many developments. We all know that human  settlement
is a hugely complicated matter and the IFP believes it is now  time  perhaps
for  some  reflection  and  analysis  of  how  we  are  establishing   these
communities. Are we constructing, in some cases, social time-bombs?

I think we need to now urgently heed the warnings  of  some  social  workers
and psychologists and other health professionals, who have told us  in  many
of our hearings, that the aberrant sexual behaviour of many  of  our  youths
who are  now  in  the  criminal  justice  system,  can  be  related  to  the
conditions under which they were raised, and  specifically  to  overcrowding
and exposure to adult sexual activity at too early an  age.  We  acknowledge
that these are hugely sensitive and complex matters which we cannot  resolve
overnight, but nevertheless, we ignore them at our peril.

We note that in various reports on  housing  developments  throughout  South
Africa, experts in the field acknowledge that cooperative  programmes  about
which you spoke, which have incorporated self-help and self-reliance of  the
future residents are extremely successful. Once  more,  Minister,  we  thank
you for really focusing on this  issue  here  today,  and  highlighting  the
emphasis on self-sufficiency and the involvement of  the  beneficiaries.  We
clearly must get people personally involved in the design  and  construction
of their homes and communities.

As  we  all  know  the  recent  international  conference   on   sustainable
development and the associated input from  housing  professionals  from  all
over  the  world,  brought  forth  many  wonderful  and  innovative  housing
alternatives to the little boxes on the  hillsides  that  we  are  currently
constructing. I think we need to focus more on innovative design.

Finally, Minister, it is well known that the IFP enjoys the support of  tens
of thousands of citizens who live in hostels, particularly  in  Gauteng  and
KwaZulu-Natal. There was a time when these people were persecuted for  their
support of the IFP, and attempts were made to actually  cage  these  persons
like animals behind barbed wire and other barricades. Thankfully this is  no
longer the case, but we all know the history of why  these  men  are  there,
and how residency has become intergenerational.

Now that we are a democracy, we cannot suddenly  expunge  the  realities  of
our  past.  These  hostel  residents  feel   as   passionate   about   their
accommodation as do residents in Claremont and Crossroads. In  this  respect
we urge you Minister to be particularly sensitive  to  the  needs  of  these
persons in these hostels, about whom little is said, and  to  recognise  the
enormous sensitivities and complexities surrounding what  are  perceived  to
be top-down, heartless and dictatorial approaches to the upgrading,  and  in
some cases, the demolition of these homes. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M M RAMAKABA-LESIEA: Chairperson, hon  members,  partners,  friends,  our
newly appointed Minister of  Housing  -  Comrade  Brigitte  Mabandla  -  and
public members joining us today, I  greet  you  all,  especially  the  Mamas
housing project, the homeless women's federation.  [Applause.]  I  am  aware
that government policy does not promote  discrimination  of  any  kind,  but
there is something that is so compelling and I find it very hard to ignore.

In our day's Budget Vote, allow me to talk about the role  played  by  women
in housing. There shall be houses, security and comfort, so reads  the  line
in the Freedom Charter. Before I can go on talking  about  women's  role  in
housing, I would first like to thank the ANC-led Government  for  converting
this statement which sounded more like a dream at that  time  into  reality.
The ANC's commitment to housing our nation was not only by  word  of  mouth.
Their commitment is demonstrated in their policies that do not only  promote
delivery, but delivery that is realised through participation,  contribution
and involvement of ordinary citizens of our country.
The people's housing process was adopted  on  the  basis  of  making  people
become  part  of  their  development  and  destiny.  Unlike  the   apartheid
government, the decisions are not made for the  people  but  made  with  the
people. As a result of this democratic approach ordinary people are able  to
form partnerships with Government and can therefore own  the  policies  that
Government is implementing.

The male dominated world that we live in has  undervalued  women  and  their
role in society. It has ascribed leadership  roles  to  men  and  created  a
stereotype that women can only be mothers, tea makers  and  caregivers.  But
if you define the role played by women in any household,  you  will  realise
that women are actually the Trevor Manuels  of  this  world  -  the  finance
ministers. Women control the budget and balance books  at  the  end  of  the
day. When the going gets tough, they never  break  down  and  cry  in  total
despair. But men find running away from a problem as the  best  solution  to
solving it, leaving women with an added responsibility  of  having  to  care
for children with little or no resources at all. This makes women  feel  the
impact of homelessness the most.

Meanwhile society has painted a picture of women  as  helpless  beings,  not
that they own any such proof. Through the people's  housing  process,  women
have proven that they do not need any  financial  management  degree  to  be
able to save for their homes and manage their finances. To those people  who
think that poor people cannot do anything for themselves, I  have  just  one
thing to say to them:  Shame  on  you.  Women  from  poor  backgrounds  have
responded positively to the Government's call for  participatory  democracy,
and doing wonders, thanks to the ANC Government.

With the little help from the Government, they  can  even  do  more.  Up  to
April 2002, women through  smaller  groups  of  PHP  in  collaboration  with
People's Dialogue and Homeless People's  Federation  had  delivered  18  138
units  nationally.  [Applause.]  To  those  who  are  sceptical  about  poor
people's ability to save, I would like you to know that  these  houses  were
built through savings and sweat equity. Saving is not a new thing.

What the ANC Government has done by promoting savings was to restore  values
of an old  tradition.  It  is  a  pity  that  some  of  us  in  this  House,
particularly the rich and those on my left, do not know what  I  am  talking
about. You must have experienced poverty at some stage in your life to  have
a clue. When apartheid preserved  jobs  for  white  people  only,  the  poor
people did not fold their arms. Instead  our  people  became  more  creative
than ever before and developed innovative  livelihood  strategies.  Stokvels
became part of those survival strategies and they did survive.

Don't go anywhere for evidence, I am one of  those  people.  [Applause.]  So
let us not patronise the poor and insult  their  abilities  by  making  them
believe they can do nothing. Here in the Western  Cape,  women  from  humble
backgrounds have  organised  themselves  into  one  coherent  group  of  326
members known  as  the  Mamas  Community  Development  Project.  [Applause.]
Within a period of 14 months these women have managed to  save  up  to  R303
000. Talk about the poor who cannot save. [Applause.]

The people's housing process is not only about building   houses,  but  also
about creating society, and in our context as South Africans, women  in  PHP
play a critical role in integrating our society along racial  and  religious
lines. It is about creating opportunities of at least one  or  two  families
to be able to put bread on the table for the duration of  the  project.  The
participants in the above-mentioned projects,  whom  I  might  add  are  95%
women, are Africans, Coloureds, Indians and Whites.

When the project is complete, these beneficiaries will be staying  together,
not as Coloureds and Africans but as citizens of South  Africa.  [Applause.]
With its emphasis on savings, the people's housing process is, in  my  view,
echoing the principles of Vukuzenzele.  By  adhering  to  the  principle  of
Vukuzenzele, PHP participants are helping Government create a  society  that
is self-reliant, promoting a culture of  involvement  and  contribution  and
practically reducing the dependency syndrome.

Women's critical role is not just about mobilising  themselves  to  register
their housing needs, but also to take  initiatives  in  realising  them.  We
have seen the Victoria Mxenge Project making tremendous inroads in  lobbying
for  land.  We  have  seen  them  getting  involved  in  every   sphere   of
construction, not just doing the planning and designing of their  homes  and
not just as labourers on the construction site,  but  most  importantly,  as
project managers and real decision-makers. PHP gives them that opportunity.

As I have mentioned before, because they are the ones who  feel  the  impact
of homelessness the most, women have been more successful and  dedicated  in
solving their problems than their male counterparts. To mention just  a  few
successful people's housing process projects. The Uitenhage PHP  project  in
the  Eastern  Cape  has  done  wonders  by  completing  over  3000   houses,
[Applause.] and the houses built won a national  award,  awarded  by  former
Minister, Comrade Sankie.

This project trained 975 people and accredited  them  with  certificates  in
bricklaying, plumbing and electricity. The  Sinethemba  Site  B  project  in
Khayelitsha completed 287 in one year. The  Matlakeng  PHP  project  in  the
Free State is also regarded as the best. This proves beyond any  doubt  that
women are not only eager, but also capable of  delivering.  Because  of  the
combination of sweat equity and monetary contributions, I have  never  heard
of one case where these beneficiaries gave  up  their  houses  for  next  to
nothing.

I am forever grateful to our former Minister of Housing, Comrade Sankie  and
to those MECs who have given the PHP the utmost consideration  it  deserves.
I would at the same time, like to make a humble appeal to the  new  Minister
to better and refine it in a way that gives more support  and  enhances  the
process. Comrade Nomatyala, PHP has never been better in  the  Western  Cape
since you took over. I understand you have approved 42 PHP projects  in  one
year. [Applause.] Halala Ntombazane!

As far as areas that need improvement are concerned, I would  like  to  tell
the National Minister that  I  am  concerned  that  the  process  of  skills
transfer which  is  the  emphasis  of  this  policy,  is  not  given  enough
attention. The support centres for the PHP groups  are  not  functioning  as
they should. This might defeat the purpose. We need to take facilitation  of
these groups back  to  where  it  belongs  on  a  permanent  basis,  to  the
provincial departments, as  opposed  to  leaving  them  on  the  independent
facilitators.

All they are after is the R36 000 facilitation grant and  after  that,  they
will be gone without even having properly facilitated the groups.  Not  that
I have anything against it, but it somehow worries me  to  see  that  it  is
only men dominating  the  construction  industry.  Government  needs  to  do
something to cater for women-headed emerging  contractors.  I  am  concerned
that the provincial  department's  capacity  to  handle  the  PHP  is  being
outgrown by the demand for PHP. I appeal to the MECs to see to it that  they
beef-up their departments with personnel in order to meet this challenge.

I also appeal to municipalities to make sure that  they  get  involved  with
the PHP at an early stage, that they  approve  building  plans  as  fast  as
possible  and  the  issue  of  title  deeds  is  addressed  as  soon  as  an
application  is  made.  I  also  appeal  to  all  officials  in   Government
structures to treat our people with respect and dignity. You are  not  doing
our people a favour by serving them, it is your job.

For the record, PHP is not meant for women only, but because it  comes  with
a lot of hard work and effort, most men just scared of getting involved.

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. Halala Makhosikazi! Halala! [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Before I call the next speaker,  there
are too many private conversations going on and you are conversing  far  too
loud. Thank you very much.
Mr C B HERANDIEN: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Allow me also to congratulate  the
hon Minister on her first speech as Minister. We  wish  you  well.  I  think
that by now, seeing that you've already travelled  throughout  most  of  the
provinces, you will have a deep sense of the major task that lies ahead.

Die Grondwet, soos die  agb  voorsitter  van  die  portefeuljekomitee  tereg
genoem het, plaas 'n verpligting op die Regering om, waar die nodige  bronne
beskikbaar  is,  behuisvesting  te  voorsien.   Daar   word   ook   in   die
Behuisingswet, Wet 107 van 1997, baie duidelik gestel dat  die  drie  vlakke
van regering moet saamspan om die lewering van huisvesting  te  vestig.  Dan
moet 'n mens jou egter onmiddellik afvra: word dit werklik waar gedoen?

As ons nou kyk na vandag se begroting wat deur  die  agb  Minister  ingedien
is, is dit duidelik dat die Regering van  sy  kant  af  sy  deel  doen.  Die
Regering kom sy grondwetlike verpligtings na deur geld beskikbaar  te  stel.
Die Regering maak hierdie geld aan provinsies beskikbaar en  die  provinsies
is veronderstel om dit aan die plaaslike owerhede beskikbaar  te  stel.  Die
drie vlakke van regering moet saamwerk.
Agb minister, vir my is daar iewers iets nie lekker nie. Op bladsy 20 van  u
verslag, u ``strategic plan,'' gee u ons 'n opsomming van wat  die  lewering
van huisvesting tot einde Januarie was, en ek lees  aan  u  'n  paar  syfers
voor uit die statistiek. Onder meer sê u in u verslag die Vrystaat  het  tot
31 Januarie 466 huise gebou; die Noord-Kaap, 638;  Limpopo,  600;  die  Wes-
Kaap, 2 358 ...

'n AGB LID: Die Oos-Kaap, niks!

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Terloops, die eienaardigste van alles  is,  die  Oos-Kaap
het tot 31 Januarie 63 137 huise gebou! [Tussenwerpsels.] Agb  minister,  my
bekommernis is - die agb  voorsitter  van  die  portefeuljekomitee  het  ook
daarna verwys - hoe dit moontlik  is  dat  dit  die  leweringsgetal  tot  31
Januarie is, maar dat dit dan ook die vier provinsies  is  wat  u  spesifiek
vermeld en sê dit is die mense wat hul volle begroting bestee het.

Die agb voorsitter van die  portefeuljekomitee  het  gesê  bestedingspatrone
moet verander, want daar kan nie soveel geld in Februarie  en  Maart  bestee
word nie. Nou ontstaan die vraag: is die geld bestee? Ek neem aan  ja,  maar
is die lewering daar? Dit is waarna ons moet ondersoek instel. Die  geld  is
bestee. Nou moet ons ons die vraag afvra: die boeke klop in die  provinsies,
maar waar is die  huise?  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Is  daardie  geld  oorgedra  en
oorgeplaas na munisipaliteite toe?

Dit is die vraag wat ons moet beantwoord, want wanneer as  ons  kyk  na  die
totale uitstaande bedrag  benodig  vir  huisvesting,  kan  ons  nie  volgens
hierdie stelsel werk nie. Dan baat dit nie dat die nasionale  Tesourie  geld
beskikbaar stel en dan ook  in  persverklarings  hul  bekommernis  uitspreek
omdat die geld nie bestee word nie. Ons sal ernstig daarna moet kyk.

Die vorige spreker het gesê - ek stem heelhartig met haar saam -  die  beste
en grootste produk wat 'n mens kry,  is  wanneer  jy  die  peoples'  housing
process aanpak, maar ons moet ook in gedagte hou dat  die  peoples'  housing
process nie vir almal is nie. Ons het ou mense, ons het mense  met  gebreke,
en ons sal 'n program moet uitwerk waarvolgens ons  dienste  aan  erwe  gaan
lewer. Die peoples' housing process kan voortgaan, maar  daar  is  'n  groep
mense vir wie ons ook sal moet voorsiening maak, vir wie getender  sal  moet
word sodat ons vir die gestremdes en dies meer voorsiening kan maak.
Daar is ook 'n ander rede waarom 'n afname in die lewering  van  huisvesting
voorkom is. Verlede jaar gedurende die begroting,  toe  die  R2,479  miljard
aangekondig is, het ek vir u voorganger  gesê  ek  stem  heelhartig  daarmee
saam; mense moet 'n bydrae lewer, maar die  inwerkingstelling  daarvan  moet
ons bespreek. Ek sal graag met u daaroor privaat in gesprek wil  tree,  want
ek het bepaalde idees.  Ek  wonder  of  dit  nie  tyd  geword  het  dat  ons
munisipaliteite  ingevolge  artikel  2  van  die  Behuisingswet  verplig  om
daardie geld aan ons mense voor te skiet,  en  dat  mense  dit  dan  oor  'n
tydperk aan die munisipaliteit terugbetaal nie, want die Behuisingswet  maak
voorsiening vir  'n  spesiale  bedryfsrekening.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The Constitution,  as  the  hon  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee
rightly mentioned, obliges the Government, if the  necessary  resources  are
available, to supply housing. It is also very clearly stated in the  Housing
Act, Act 107 of 1997 that the three tiers  of  government  must  pool  their
resources to bring about the delivery of houses. However,  then  one  should
ask oneself immediately: Is this indeed being done?

If we look at today's budget that was submitted by the  hon  Minister,  then
it is clear that the Government, on  its  part,  is  doing  its  share.  The
Government meets its constitutional obligations by making  funds  available.
The Government makes these funds available to provinces  and  the  provinces
are supposed to make it available to the local authorities. The three  tiers
of government must work together.

Hon Minister, to me something is amiss somewhere in my view. On page  20  of
your report, your strategic  plan,  you  give  us  a  summary  of  what  the
delivery of houses have been up to the end of January, and I want to to  you
a few figures from the statistics here.  Among  others  you  state  in  your
report that the Free State built 466 houses up to 31 January; Northern  Cape
638; Limpopo 600; Western Cape 2 358 ...

AN HON MEMBER: Eastern Cape, nothing!

Mr C B HERANDIEN: By the way, the most peculiar  of  it  all  is,  that  the
Eastern Cape has built 63 137 houses up to 31 January! [Interjections.]  Hon
Minister, my concern is - the hon Chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee
also referred to it - how is it possible that this is  the  delivery  figure
up to 31 January, but then these  are  also  the  four  provinces  that  you
singled out and said they were the people who had spent their full budget.

The hon chairperson of the portfolio committee said that  spending  patterns
should change, because so much money cannot be  spent  during  February  and
March. Now the question arises: Has the money spent? I assume that yes,  but
is the delivery there. This is what we  should  investigate.  The  money  is
spent. Now we have to ask: The books balance in  the  provinces,  but  where
are the houses? [Interjections.] Has that money  been  carried  forward  and
transferred to the municipalities?

This is the question that we must answer, because if we are looking  at  the
total outstanding amount needed for housing, then we cannot  work  according
to this system. Then it does not  help  that  the  National  Treasury  makes
money available and at the same time voice their concern that the  money  is
not spent. We must take a serious look at this.

The previous speaker said - and I agree with her wholeheartedly -  the  best
and biggest product that one gets,  is  when  one  undertakes  the  People's
Housing Process, but we should also bear in mind that the  People's  Housing
Project is not for everybody. We  have  old  people,  we  have  people  with
disabilities and we must work out a programme  according  to  which  we  are
going to service erven. The  People's  Housing  Process  can  continue,  but
there is a group of people for whom we must also make  provision  that  will
have to go out on tender in  order  that  we  can  make  provision  for  the
disabled and suchlike.

There is also another reason for the decrease in the  delivery  of  housing.
Last year during the budget when R2,479 billion was announced, I  told  your
predecessor that I  wholeheartedly  agreed  with  it;  people  must  make  a
contribution, but we must discuss its implementation. I would like to  enter
into some discussion with you about that, because I do have  certain  ideas.
I wonder if the time has not come  that  we  compel  the  municipalities  in
terms of section 2 of the Housing Act to lend that money to our  people  and
that the people can pay it back to the municipality over a period  of  time,
because the  Housing  Act  does  make  provision  for  a  special  operating
account.]

How many municipalities out there always plead poverty? They never have  any
money, but I know of a few who have got special ... not operating  accounts,
but special savings accounts.

Daarom het ons in die  portefeuljekomitee  gevra  dat  'n  diepgaande  oudit
gedoen moet word van die boeke van alle munisipaliteite in  die  land  sodat
ons kan kyk waar die geld is wat veronderstel is om in hulle boeke te  wees.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[For that reason we in the portfolio committee asked that  an  urgent  audit
of the books of all municipalities in the country should be done so that  we
can see where the money is that is supposed to be on their books.]

The special  operating  account  is  supposed  to  contain  allocations  for
housing delivery.

Ek weet van 'n munisipaliteit wat konsultante aangestel het om vir hulle  te
sê hoe om R40 miljoen ten beste te belê. Ons kan dit nie bekostig nie.  Daar
moet  dringend  daarna  gekyk  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[I know of a municipality who appointed consultants to tell  them  how  best
to invest R40 million. We cannot afford this. An urgent  investigation  into
these matters is needed.]

Another point is the institutional subsidy - a very good thing - but  nobody
wants to touch it because of the administrative  capacity  that  they  don't
have. Why can't we force the municipalities to become  the  institution?  We
have done it in the past and it  worked  perfectly.  They've  got  capacity.
Every time you want municipalities  to  do  something  they  tell  you  they
haven't got the capacity, but they've got enough officials  to  even  invade
Iraq.  [Interjections.]  Why  can't  they  do  this?  They  will   help   us
enormously, because they are at grass-roots level; they are in the  position
to co-ordinate and administer this whole process.

Die laaste punt wat ek graag aan u wil voorhou, Minister,  is  die  volgende
kwessie.  U  voorganger  was  bewus  daarvan  en  die  voorsitter  van   die
portefeuljekomitee kan u ook  daaroor  inlig.  Ons  het  probleme  gehad  in
sekere provinsies waar oordrag nie kan plaasvind nie as gevolg van die  feit
dat dit stamgrond is. Daar sou 'n verandering  in  wetgewing  en  regulasies
gekom het. Ek wil weet hoe ver gevorder is met hierdie proses sodat ons  ook
daardie  mense  kan   help.   Veral   in   Noordwes,   in   die   voormalige
Bophuthatswana, het ons probleme ondervind en kan daardie mense nie  oordrag
kry nie.

Ten laaste net, Minister, wanneer u met die banke gaan onderhandel,  wil  ek
aan die hand doen dat u asseblief vir hulle sê dit help nie  hulle  gee  vir
ons mense lenings en dan gebeur wat in die tagtigerjare gebeur het nie.  Toe
Blue Downs aangelê is, was die rentekoers 11,25%, en twee  jaar  later,  toe
draai hy by 27%, en niemand kon die lening meer bekostig  nie.  Wanneer  ons
met die banke gaan onderhandel, moet ons  kyk  na  maniere  waarop  ons  die
banke kan vra om daardie rentekoerse in 'n mate vir  ons  konstant  te  hou,
want mense kan dit eenvoudig nie bybring as die rentekoers met 5% styg  nie.
Dan raak dit onbekostigbaar.

Ons wil graag hê die finansiële instellings moet help, maar hulle  moet  ons
help sodat ons kan voortgaan om in ons huise te bly. Hulle moenie ons  mense
uit hul huise net help nie. Hulle moet  ons  bystaan  sodat  ons  ons  huise
bekostigbaar kan kry.

Ek het 'n heel laaste punt, en dan sal ek loop. U kollega die  Minister  vir
Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering het sy wetgewing deurgevoer  wat  sê  geen
oordragte mag plaasvind nie tensy dienstegelde ten volle betaal is.  In  die
Wes-Kaap het ons wetgewing ingedien  wat  sê  vir  die  doeleindes  van  die
kapitaalsubsidie kan met die munisipaliteit  reëlings  getref  word  en  kan
oordrag geskied. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The last point I would like to present to you, Minister, is  the  following
issue.  Your  predecessor  knew  about  this  and  the  chairperson  of  the
portfolio committee  can  also  inform  you.  We  had  problems  in  certain
provinces where transfer could not take place due to the fact  that  it  was
tribal land.  There  would  have  been  a  change  in  the  legislation  and
regulations. I want to know how much process has been made with the  process
so that we  can  help  those  people  too.  Especially  in  the  North  West
province, in the  erstwhile  Bophuthatswana,  we  encountered  problems  and
those people could not get transfer.

Lastly only this, Minister, when you go and  negotiate  with  the  banks,  I
suggest that you please tell them that it does not help  if  they  give  our
people loans and then something happens like  in  the  eighties.  When  Blue
Downs was built, the interest rate  was  11,25%,  and  two  years  later  it
turned at 27% and no one could afford the loans anymore. When  we  negotiate
with the banks we must look at ways of how we can  ask  the  banks  to  keep
those interest rates constant to  some  degree,  because  people  can  quite
simply not afford it if the interest rate  rises  by  5%.  Then  it  becomes
unaffordable.

We would like the financial institutions to help, but they must help  us  to
keep on staying in our houses. They should not help our people out of  their
houses. They  must  help  assist  us  so  that  we  can  render  our  houses
affordable.

I have a final last point and then I shall go. Your colleague  the  Minister
for Provincial and Local Government  passed  his  legislation  which  states
that no transfers may go through unless  service  fees  have  been  paid  in
full. In the Western Cape we submitted legislation which  states  that,  for
the purposes of  capital  subsidies,  arrangements  can  be  made  with  the
municipality and transfer can then take place.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr C B HERANDIEN: Praat asseblief met u kollega  sodat  daardie  verandering
aangebring kan word. Ek dank  u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Please  talk  to  your
colleague  so  that  this  amendment  can  be   effected.   I   thank   you.
[Interjections.]]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Minister,  there  is  a  wide  discrepancy  between
money spent on the quantity of houses built and the quality of these homes.

The Government prides itself on having built about 1,3 million houses  since
1994, but closer inspection reveals that these homes  fall  apart  within  a
few years. People are forced to live in matchbox-type  houses  in  which  no
regard is given to space or privacy. The  houses  built  deprive  people  of
their  human  dignity.  Millions  of  rands  are   allocated   to   building
inspectors, with very little  administrative  accountability  required  from
the department or the contractor  to  enforce  capacity  and  capability  to
deliver.

Instances have been  recorded  over  the  past  few  years  which  show  the
department's  insufficient  handling,  monitoring  and   implementation   of
housing projects. For instance, a recent article in the Sowetan states  that
a company which had been awarded a contract of R7,5  million  to  build  500
houses had been liquidated.

The newspaper's investigation at the site found that only a  few  incomplete
houses and toilets had been erected. The department  had  already  paid  the
company R4,2 million of the R7,5 million contract. How could so  much  money
have been given to a company when there is almost zero proof  that  anything
has been done? The department is guilty of  gross  neglect  and  if  it  was
possible, should be held responsible  as  an  accomplice  in  the  theft  of
taxpayers' money and denying people their constitutional right to shelter.

In the Western Cape the Anti-Eviction Campaign employs unlawful  tactics  to
force people out  of  their  homes.  A  mother's  home  in  Khayelitsha  was
allegedly torched by this group because she had bought a repossessed  house.
Whatever grievances the Anti-Eviction Campaign may have, their  actions  are
unwarranted, and the police and the department appear  helpless  to  assist.
The administrative standards and delivery of houses are  in  a  crisis,  and
the standards to protect the basic  needs  of  our  people  are  of  a  poor
quality.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Thank you.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Chairperson, it seems that I too have  joined  the  black
and red brigade of today. Chairperson, comrade Minister,  comrades  and  hon
members, I wish to  congratulate  the  hon  Minister  Brigitte  Mabandla  as
Minister of Housing and wish her well in her new  role  as  the  builder-in-
chief. We are  confident  and  know  that  she  will  ensure  the  continued
implementation of the policies of the ANC  and  of  our  Government  in  the
programmes of the Department of Housing.

Over the past nine years, the housing delivery programme of our  Government,
the ANC-led Government, has played an important  role  in  helping  to  push
back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  We  have  witnessed  over  1,4   million
beneficiaries receiving new homes, positively impacting on  the  improvement
of the living standards of over  5  million  people.  The  housing  delivery
programme has not just delivered new homes. It has also  seen  the  delivery
of electricity, water,  sanitation  and  other  services  such  as  clinics,
schools, roads and community centres amongst others.

Since 1994, our Government has spent over R5 billion on bulk  infrastructure
needed for housing development and plans to spend a further R8 billion  over
the next three years, bringing total expenditure to R13 billion by the  year
2005/06. All of this  has  improved  the  quality  of  living  standards  of
millions of our people resulting in the frontiers of  poverty  being  pushed
back. We are indeed seeing the Freedom Charter  document  being  transformed
into a living reality for our people. I wish to quote from it as follows:


  All people shall have the right to live where they  choose,  be  decently
  housed and to bring up their families in comfort and security. ...  Slums
  shall be demolished and new surburbs  built  where  all  have  transport,
  roads, lighting, playing fields, creches and social centres.

The housing delivery programme is not just about the building of  homes.  It
covers a wide range of areas such as access to finance, rental housing,  the
quality and standard of construction and  saving  schemes,  amongst  others.
These necessitated the creation  of  various  housing  support  institutions
such as the National Home Builders  Registration  Council,  Servcon  Housing
Solutions, Thubelisha  Homes,  National  Urban  Reconstruction  and  Housing
Agency,  Peoples  Housing  Partnership  Trust,  Rural  Housing  Loan   Fund,
National Housing Finance Corporation and the Social Housing Foundation.

These institutions  are  expected  to  assist  in  achieving  the  following
objectives. These include encouraging the formal banking sector to  increase
lending to the lower end of the housing market, proactive  steps  to  foster
growth  and  development  of  the  emerging  alternative   lending   sector,
initiatives to stimulate the provision of housing under a variety of  tenure
options and mechanisms to promote and expand the amount of personal  savings
mobilised in the housing process.

Mr K M ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Thank you, Mr Ellis.

All of these institutions are required to submit quarterly  reports  to  the
Department of Housing in accordance with the Public Finance Management  Act,
with annual reports being tabled in Parliament.

For the purposes of this debate, I want  to  focus  on  three  institutions,
namely the National Home  Builders  Registration  Council,  Servcon  Housing
Solutions and the National Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency.

The National Home Builders Registration Council was established  to  provide
protection for housing consumers through a home warranty  protection  scheme
against defects in  new  homes,  to  regulate  the  home  building  industry
through the registration of  builders  and  to  set  ethical  and  technical
standards for the residential building industry.

With effect from 1 April 2002, the warranty scheme  was  extended  to  cover
the Government housing subsidy scheme as the Minister  has  indicated.  This
is  in  line  with  the  Department  of  Housing's   emphasis   on   quality
construction. The NHBRC will ensure that all homes are  inspected  prior  to
handover by  the  contractor.  The  inspections  will  focus  on  structural
aspects such as the foundation and roof overhangs. Where it  is  found  that
construction does not comply with the  required  standards,  the  contractor
will be required to rectify this before the house can be  signed  off.  This
will ensure that beneficiaries  receive  a  quality  product  and  that  the
housing subsidy receives value for money.

Whilst the NHBRC inspection will focus on  the  structural  aspects  of  the
house, consideration should be  given  to  include  the  inspection  of  the
minimum standards as laid out in the housing code. As  we  have  been  going
around the country, we have noticed that  some  developers  have  tended  to
deviate from the minimum standards as set out.

The training of emerging contractors is of critical  importance.  Whilst  on
the one hand inspections are carried out to  ensure  a  quality  product  is
delivered, emerging  contractors  need  to  receive  both  the  support  and
training in order for them  to  deliver  a  quality  product.  The  training
should not only focus on construction methods but also  needs  to  focus  on
areas such as financial management  and  general  business  skills  so  that
these contractors are able  to  succeed  beyond  their  involvement  in  the
building of subsidy homes.

We are equally confident that corrupt and unscrupulous contractors  will  be
frightened away from participating in this important area  of  delivery  due
to the strict requirements that will be set out in the warranty scheme.  The
warranty scheme excludes homes built under the people's housing process.  We
in the ANC urge that communities and  individuals  who  participate  in  the
people's housing process, be assisted in accessing the correct  training  so
that the product they build is  one  of  quality  that  meets  the  required
standards.

Servcon came into being  out  of  an  agreement  entered  into  between  the
Government and the Banking Council which represents the banks.  Servcon  was
mandated to  manage  the  disposal  of  properties,  in  affected  areas.  A
critical part of Servcon's mandate focuses on rightsizing.  The  concept  of
rightsizing is unique in that it has targeted specific home-owners, who  due
to various reasons, were not able to afford the homes they owned  and  faced
eviction by the banking institution from which they had secured  their  home
loan. This  agreement,  which  Government  entered  into  with  the  banking
sector, provided an alternative to eviction  and  homelessness.  It  allowed
for an affordable interim rental to be negotiated, a special subsidy  to  be
provided for by Government for an  alternative  and  more  affordable  home,
subsequently allowing for the original  homes  to  be  sold  back  into  the
housing market.

The affected home  owners  were  invited  to  become  part  of  this  unique
intervention on the  part  of  Government.  Many  effected  homeowners  have
accepted and have benefited  from  this  intervention.  They  have  been  in
effect able to walk away from the debt which they had and start afresh in  a
new  and  more  affordable  home.  Because  of  the  care  of  this  ANC-led
Government, a beneficiary of this intervention wrote  on  the  wall  of  her
home and I quote:


  At last I have a home and I can sleep without the  worry  of  bank  debts
  over my head.

Unfortunately, some elements, particularly here in the  Western  Cape,  have
sought  to  derail  this  unique  and  important  intervention.  They   call
themselves the Anti-Eviction Campaign. They intimidate individuals who  have
decided to accept the rightsizing intervention. Many of them have  not  paid
their home loans to banks for  many  years.  They  themselves  entered  into
agreements with banks to purchase their  own  homes  and  have  subsequently
defaulted. Again I want to clearly state that it is this ANC-led  Government
which decided to intervene and assist affected home-owners  covered  by  the
record  of  understanding  who  faced   potential   evictions   by   banking
institutions.

We want to appeal to members of the  Anti-Eviction  Campaign  here  in  Cape
Town, to work and co-operate with Government because it is the  right  thing
to do.

Currently, we are seeing a situation  in  our  country  whereby  many  home-
owners are  battling  to  afford  the  homes  they  have  purchased  through
financial institutions. Whilst we do not expect  financial  institutions  to
become charitable institutions, we do expect that they  give  proper  advice
to  prospective  home  owners  and  that  they  also   explain   fully   the
consequences of defaulting on home loans.

We further ask that financial institutions act with compassion when  dealing
with individuals who genuinely face difficulties in meeting their home  loan
obligations. Furthermore, we call on prospective home  owners  not  to  over
commit themselves but rather to buy what they can afford today and not  what
they think they can afford tomorrow.

Nurcha was established in 1995 as an RDP Presidential  Lead  Project  by  an
agreement  between  the  South  African  Government  and  the  Open  Society
Institute of New York to help release  finance  for  low-cost  housing  from
financial  institutions.  One  of  their  programmes  is  to  initiate   the
development of savings to increase access to  affordable  credit  and  other
housing benefits for lower income consumers.

Nurcha has  undertaken  commendable  work  throughout  the  country  holding
workshops to teach and educate communities about  the  benefits  of  saving.
They have negotiated with certain banking institutions  across  the  country
where they have managed to introduce the National Savings Scheme, a  savings
plan that is accessible to the poor.  To  date,  over  40  000  people  have
registered with the scheme as savers.

This is in line with the housing subsidy requirement  whereby  beneficiaries
are required to save an amount of R2  479  as  a  contribution  towards  the
housing subsidy. Beyond just contributing  this  money,  it  also  helps  to
create and promote a culture of ownership and will  hopefully  lead  to  and
discourage the selling of homes and renting of homes by  beneficiaries  once
they receive them. Nurcha also educates  community  members  about  housing,
teaching them to see their home as an asset and  how  they  can  use  it  to
generate income possibly as a venue for a home business. By saving they  can
extend their home which would also help to increase its value.

Throughout the country we have seen communities starting up  saving  schemes
resulting in them being able to build  bigger  homes  and  to  extend  their
existing homes. The Homeless Peoples Federation is an example of this  where
through their savings schemes, homes in excess of 50m2 have been built.  The
housing support institutions and others that I mentioned earlier  are  doing
extremely good work. Unfortunately though, not enough  of  our  people  know
about these  institution.  We  would  urge  these  housing  institutions  to
promote themselves  more  aggressively  and  to  provide  easily  accessible
information to communities, particularly communities in the rural  parts  of
our country.

As I draw to a conclusion, I wish to discuss an issue that is  happening  in
my constituency and I am  sure  elsewhere  in  the  country.  Recently,  the
Minister of Labour announced the wage determination for farmworkers.  In  my
constituency, Randfontein, we are now starting to get reports  that  farmers
are attempting to evict workers from their  farms.  We  want  to  appeal  to
these farmers to treat farmworkers as human beings  and  to  treat  them  as
they themselves would want to be treated. One of the consequences  of  these
actions will be that farmworkers will  lose  their  accommodation  and  find
themselves homeless. Our Government is  implementing  programmes  to  ensure
that farmworkers are able to live in  a  secure  manner  without  having  to
constantly worry about whether they will have somewhere to stay  tonight  or
not.

Having had the opportunity to be part of  the  Housing  Portfolio  Committee
visits to seven of our provinces, I can  confidently  state  that  much  has
changed in our country  since  1994.  The  housing  delivery  programme  has
touched almost  every  city  and  town  in  our  country.  In  each  housing
development that we have visited, the response  from  the  beneficiaries  of
the housing delivery programme is that their living  standards  have  indeed
changed.

As a proud member  of  the  ANC  I  wish  to  join  my  fellow  comrades  in
supporting this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

[Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson, the UCDP accepts this budget. Hon  Minister  of
Finance, problems never cease to exist. One rotten potato spoils  the  rest.
This whole great job  is  spoilt  by  building  contractors  who  use  cheap
materials in the construction of many buildings. This  budget  should  build
us real houses, those whose value suits their prices.]

Hon members, access to adequate housing is now  a  fundamental  human  right
embodied in section 26 of the Constitution of South Africa.  Hence  the  aim
of the Department  of  Housing  is  to  ensure  that  every  South  African,
particularly the poor,  have  access  to  permanent  residential  structures
within sustainable human settlements.

The hon Minister of Housing has to be applauded for providing  more  than  6
million poor people with homes since 1994. This reflects an  improvement  in
living conditions for 4% of the population. Projects  are  considered  under
programmes such as infrastructure upgrading initiatives  to  facilitate  the
redevelopment of depressed areas or to  improve  access  to  employment  and
business opportunities.

The people's housing process  recognises  the  efforts  and  initiatives  of
those who prefer to build their own houses and are prepared to commit  their
resources,  skills  and  energies  in  housing   themselves.   It   provides
technical, financial and other support to these  people.  The  total  amount
allocated to all provinces for housing capacity building in 2002-03  is  R10
million. The money has been allocated directly from  the  National  Treasury
to the respective provinces. They have to take into account current  housing
needs and backlogs as  well  as  available  resources  and  on  that  basis,
prioritise the needs of the various national housing programmes.

The  lack  of  capacity  which  entails  an  efficient  workforce  and   the
installation of appropriate technology, equipment and ... [Time expired.]

(Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Ms C I LUDWABE: Mr Chairperson and our  hon  Minister  whom  we  love,  our
Chairperson, our MEC for the province and  the  members  of  this  House,  I
greet you.
I want to ask our Minister not to worry himself about people who have  never
gone  through  the  painful  life,  which  we  experienced,  of   taking   a
wheelbarrow loaded with sand and setting up a place to stay in. He must  not
worry himself about those who were never affected but he must look  forward,
because we know that if it is a woman who is tasked with development, it  is
going to happen. [Applause.]

Chairperson, I am delighted to take part in this  Budget  Vote.  We  commend
and are grateful to our Government for having built  houses  for  us.  Women
can now also own houses. There they are today, beautiful  as  they  are  and
able to build houses for themselves. A  woman  can  wake  up  today  in  the
morning and hold a glass of water in front of her own house. We  are  saying
to the Government of the ANC: Go on, do likewise in the future. [Applause.]

Chairperson, with respect, I ask leaders in  the  villages  and  traditional
leaders to encourage people with housing development, as  Government  builds
even in the villages. Others say the villages will  change  into  townships.
That is not so. Government wants everybody to taste the fruits in  the  same
manner. We are grateful to Government because houses are  also  being  built
in the rural areas.
Rural areas do not consist of villages only. There are farmers as  well  who
occupy Government land, about whom we ask that they  not  be  forgotten.  In
Port Elizabeth, at places like Seaview, Fishers' Corner and  others,  people
have no houses, electricity and toilets, and we ask the Ministers to  afford
these places attention. We hope that  they  will  also  be  visited  as  the
process of building houses takes place everywhere. We build even  in  places
like that, but we just want to issue a caution, as these places had not  yet
been completed when the Minister arrived.

We know that our Government, from 1912 until today,  has  never  reneged  on
what it promised to fulfil. It is still  committed  to  the  promises.  With
those words I thank the Minister and the Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson,  section  26  of  the  Constitution  gives
everyone the right of access  to  adequate  housing,  and  section  28(1)(c)
affords children the right to shelter. Section 28(1)(c) and section  26,  in
other words, raise questions about enforceability as well  as  accessibility
by citizens to social and economic rights. For example, in  this  context  a
group of children living in appalling circumstances such as the  streets  of
Hillbrow or any street  in  our  country,  are  they  in  terms  of  section
28(1)(c) supposed to be afforded adequate shelter by the state?

AZAPO believes that the position of  street  kids  warrants  examination  in
terms of section 28(1)(c) of our  Constitution.  To  this  end,  AZAPO  also
accepts that resources might not be adequate to  deliver  immediate  shelter
to these children. At the same time we are of  the  view  that  despite  the
question of resources, the state must  demonstrate  that  every  effort  has
been made to use the resources at its disposal to satisfy the  minimum  core
of this right.

AZAPO's view is that ever  since  the  new  dispensation,  the  position  of
street kids and their housing needs in particular,  has  been  relegated  to
NGOs  and  other  bodies  that  are  championing  children's  rights  whilst
actually  section  28(1)(c)  contemplates  that  these  children  should  be
afforded this right. It is however, our argument that the real  question  in
terms of the Constitution is actually whether adequate  measures  have  been
taken by the state to realise the right afforded by section 28(1)(c) and  if
adequate steps have been taken, whether these are reasonable  in  comparison
with the available resources at the disposal of the state.

I now turn to section 26 of our Constitution and I  provide  its  provisions
as a point of departure. In that section it is stated that:


  Everyone has the right to have access to adequate housing. The state must
  take reasonable legislative and  other  measures,  within  its  available
  resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of this right.


  No one may be evicted from their home, or  have  their  home  demolished,
  without an order  of  court  made  after  considering  all  the  relevant
  circumstances. No legislation may permit arbitrary evictions.

To this end, banking institutions  in  particular,  have  not  played  their
part, because many of our people have been evicted without any real  reasons
that are prescribed for in this section. AZAPO believes that  the  provision
of housing should not only mean bricks and mortar which presently is met  by
the so-called RDP houses. Most of these houses qualify as brick and  mortar.
To AZAPO, decent houses require available land,  appropriate  services  such
as the provision of water and the removal  of  sewerage.  Therefore,  for  a
person to have access to adequate housing contemplated by the  Constitution,
there must be land; there must be services; there must be a structure.

To this end, AZAPO makes a distinction between those who can afford  to  pay
for housing and those who cannot. For  those  who  can  afford  to  pay  for
adequate housing, AZAPO believes that the state  has  played  its  part  and
continues to facilitate access to shelter by this group but  for  those  who
cannot, the poor, particularly the vulnerable, AZAPO  believes  their  needs
require special and urgent attention and AZAPO also is pleased that the  new
Minister has indeed announced that this is going to  happen.  The  so-called
RDP  houses  being  bricks  and  mortar  do  not,  in  our  view,  meet  the
requirements as set out in the Constitution. To this end we are  pleased  to
note that the department does indeed also in the Budget Vote admit  to  this
and has promised to improve this area in this regard.

We hope that the department under the new  Minister,  will  attend  to  this
dehumanising phenomenon of our country's housing system  for  the  poor.  We
also notice  that  the  Budget  Vote  does  not  deal  with  the  systematic
programme for the housing needs of poor people in most of  the  rural  areas
and we are also pleased that the new Minister has announced that  this  will
be attended to.

Despite all these reservations, AZAPO supports the Budget Vote.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you Chairperson, Minister.

The aim of the Department of Housing is: To determine, finance, promote, co-
ordinate, communicate and monitor the implementation of policy  for  housing
and human settlement''. With the harsh situation of poverty in South  Africa
and the need  to  correct  the  injustices  of  the  apartheid  regime,  the
Minority Front notes the challenges incumbent upon this department.

With the majority  of  our  population  illiterate,  unemployed,  living  in
informal settlements with minimal resources, the need  for  this  department
to utilise the budget it is allocated wisely is crucial. It is  pleasing  to
note that since December 1994  some  1,45  million  housing  subsidies  were
approved and 1,3 million  housing  units  constructed.  This  certainly  has
contributed to our challenge to overcome  poverty  and  promote  sustainable
development.The focus in this department and housing policies  have  notably
shifted from the  quantity  of  houses  erected  to  the  quality  of  house
erected.

Another issue of concern regarding the department would be that of  informal
settlements. We have to do something  to  get  these  people  proper  living
conditions and resources. Those who survive in these  settlements  are  made
nomadic and forced to move from time to  time,  resulting  in  violence  and
discontent as recently experienced in  the  Sweet  Home  Settlement  in  the
Western Cape.

The importance of this department  in  generating  sustainable  development,
employment and wealth is  crucial.  The  need  for  private  investment  and
efforts are necessary and the Department appears to have established a  good
working relationship with the private sector in doing so.

The Minority Front though  is  confident  in  the  department's  ability  to
perform. In view of the budget allocated to the department it is hoped  that
it shall assist in the delivery and attainment of the department's  aims  in
line with our citizenry's needs. The Minority Front is  further  pleased  to
note  the  increase  in  the  budget  allocation  to  the   Housing   Sector
Performance  Programme,  communication,  housing  development  funding   and
housing equity. It is hoped that the funds be utilised wisely to attain  our
intended results.

At the end of the  day  we  are  striving  to  overcome  poverty,  inculcate
sustainable developmemt and ensure a nation where  our  people's  needs  are
met and guaranteed as priority. Let us get together and strive for a  better
South Africa in pushing back the frontiers of poverty.  The  Minority  Front
supports the Budget. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J H NASH: Mr Chairperson, never in the history of this country  has  such
a massive housing development programme been embarked upon,  especially  for
the poor and historically  marginalised  of  our  society.  The  development
targets set by the ANC-led Government was achieved.  In  other  words,  more
than 1,46 million homes have been developed.

The opposition has consistently pointed out  that  the  development  of  one
million homes was unrealistic and never achievable.  They  complained  about
the size and quality of these homes without saying that they  preferred  the
vast majority of these new home-owners to  live  in  squatter  camps  rather
than to have a small home that can be incrementally developed. It should  be
clear to all that  these  new  home-owners  were  previously  excluded  from
either owning land or a home under apartheid South Africa.

It is now imperative that after Government has met the target,  there  is  a
shift in the next phase of housing development from quantity to quality  for
the historically disadvantaged.

In this regard, it is important to highlight the constituency  that  I  have
the privilege to serve. In Barkley East, a new  housing  scheme  was  built.
The homes are of brick construction and are 40m² in size. The  community  in
Barkley East volunteered to clean the streets; to open  the  drains  and  to
clean the hospital, which they did.  Barkley  East  won  the  award  as  the
cleanest town in the Eastern Cape.

What is important is the size of the homes.  If  the  contractor  who  could
produce 40m² homes in an area that is far  from  building  suppliers,  where
transport costs are high, and still stay within the subsidy,  it  should  be
possible for contractors in urban areas to do the same. You will  note  that
I am pleading that contractors should build bigger homes.

Contractors in urban areas are hellbent  on  making  huge  profits  as  they
skimp on building materials and the size of  homes.  The  major  contractors
have not entered into the spirit of caring and developing, so anything  will
do as long as the contractors make maximum profits.

We acknowledge that business is about making profit,  but  contractors  must
also plough back a share of their profits in the spirit  of  pure  community
development.

In the new phase of developing homes for the poor, the size of the  home  is
important as a 40m² home allows for  the  development  of  different  rooms,
thereby separating parents from  their  children  when  at  night  they  are
nation-building. [Laughter.] It also allows children to  burn  the  midnight
oil when they study without disturbing  working  parents.  This  development
would positively contribute to the moral regeneration of our communities.
In Lady Grey, we were able to erect four thermally efficient homes with  the
assistance of the Netherlands government who provided the extra R3  000  per
home to make the homes thermally efficient. Lady Grey is one of the  coldest
places in South Africa. Passive thermal efficiency was utilised. The  houses
had longer roof overhangs to keep out  the  overhead  rays  of  the  sun  in
summer, but still allows the slanting rays  of  the  sun  to  penetrate  the
house in  winter.  The  houses  were  north-facing,  to  enjoy  the  maximum
sunshine. Ceilings and floor coverings were installed and doors and  windows
were properly  fitted  to  seal  the  homes  against  harsh  weather.  These
improvements cost an extra R3 000 per home. With the subsidy of R17  000  at
that stage, the thermally efficient home costs R20 000. Minister, we  should
really think of further improving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  poor  by
adopting passive thermally efficient building methods.

It is equally important to deal with the redlining policy of the  banks.  It
is  becoming  more  and  more   difficult   for   people   in   historically
disadvantaged areas to obtain housing loans.  In  most  disadvantaged  areas
there is a ceiling placed on loans irrespective of the value of  the  homes.
This inhibits people from improving their homes as they will  not  obtain  a
return on their investment, should they  want  to  sell  their  homes.  This
practice also  inhibits  the  property  market  in  disadvantaged  areas  as
property values are in a de facto sense capped. This is also a technique  to
ensure that certain areas are still kept lily white, as  redlining  prevents
the upward social mobility of people of colour. [Laughter.]

I must really commend the level of intergovernmental  co-operation  for  the
manner in which they have improved the lives of our people.  The  Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry has made possible 50 kilolitres of free  basic
water; the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs is providing  food  in
the form of seed to the poorest households; the Department of  Minerals  and
Energy will roll  out  50  kilowats  of  free  basic  electricity,  and  the
Department of Social Development has  brought  better  pensions,  disability
grants and child support grants.  These  initiatives  have  brought  poverty
relief and pushed back the frontiers of poverty in every way.

Rural communities are being provided  with  non-grid  electricity  in  their
homes. This allows for modern communication  into  rural  homes,  which  was
previously unheard of and allows for educational development in the homes.

Clinics and schools have been electrified in non-grid  areas  through  solar
energy and photo voltaics, allowing for development of the sciences  in  the
schools and medicines to be stored under optimal conditions.

Communications have also improved with  the  supply  of  telephones  through
photo voltaics, thus making this medium of communication  possible  as  well
as young schoolchildren now having access to the Internet.

I must also commend the Department of Minerals and  Energy  for  introducing
the  low-smoke  coal  initiative  in  Soweto.  This  initiative  would  help
families to eliminate the health hazards of smoke inhalation.

I better stop highlighting the  remarkable  level  of  delivery  before  the
House is disrupted through the crying of the opposition DA. [Laughter.]

The opposition has given a lot of advice. Ms Semple has given us  a  bit  of
policy; Ms Vos has given us a bit of policy and  Mr  Herandien,  the  ex-MEC
has given us a lot of policy. I don't want to talk  about  the  ACDP.  Thank
you very much for your bit of advice because we  know  it  all  already.  We
don't want to be told  by  you  what  to  do.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  The
Minister is very capable of doing what she has to do.

I want to turn to Mr Lee. Mr Lee comes from the  Eastern  Cape.  He  doesn't
even know that 6 000 homes were  built  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.] What is the good of having a representative  in  Cape  Town  who
comes from the Eastern Cape who doesn't even know what is going  on  in  the
Eastern  Cape?  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  But  he  is  asking  what  is  the
Government doing. He hasn't listened to my speech  on  all  the  things  the
Government  has  done.  [Laughter.]  [Applause.]  This  is  the   level   of
opposition we've got! [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: It wasn't worth listening to!

Mr J H NASH: Yes, it wasn't worth listening to, exactly  because  you  don't
know what it is to be poor.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  You  don't  know
that. You've got a golden spoon in your mouth. You don't know  what  happens
in a poor community. I challenge you to go and spend one  night  in  a  poor
area so that you can be educated.

Mr Lee, you have spoken about Vergenoeg in East London. Do you know that  in
Vergenoeg, East London we have very big housing projects?  I  know  what  is
going on in my constituency. Poor Mr Lee, he doesn't know what is  going  on
in his own  constituency,  but  he  is  talking  about  my  constituency  of
Vergenoeg. [Laughter.] [Applause.] He doesn't  talk  about  Port  Elizabeth,
where he comes from.

The ANC and the people of South Africa expect no less from  Government  than
the level of delivery thus far achieved.

Here are the never-never boys and if the ANC-led  Government  actually  took
the never-never approach of the DA, then  we  would  have  landed  ourselves
back into the old South Africa under a new democratic dispensation.

Minister, the problem that we currently face in the housing sector  is  that
the opposition, in the form of the DA, is hopelessly ineffective  in  making
constructive  suggestions  for  the  development  of  security,  peace   and
comfort. The reality is that throughout your term as Minister you  have  not
received any concrete proposals for the supply of low-cost  housing  to  the
historically disadvantaged communities ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Go and look in KwaZulu-Natal!

Mr J H NASH: Do you know that some of the housing schemes  in  KwaZulu-Natal
have such small houses that you can't even have a room to  swing  a  cat  in
them? [Laughter.]

Minister, the reality is that throughout your term as Minister you have  not
received any concrete proposals for the supply of low-cost  housing  to  the
historically disadvantaged  communities  at  the  cheapest  possible  price.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, what do I honestly say after Mr  Nash?
Comrade thank you for that input. I want to make a general statement  before
I respond to the inputs from the debate. Firstly, I want to generally  thank
all of you who participated in the debate in that all of  you  support  this
Budget. But I also want to say that in fact I know that a number  of  issues
that you have raised are matters that have arisen over the  years  when  you
dealt with housing.

My budget speech was essentially a report-back on measures that  were  taken
to address the problems that you have raised over the years. It is  in  that
context that I will then respond. I will take this opportunity to  say  what
I wanted to say earlier on; I thank the people who received me  who  are  in
PHP and I noted very carefully the  remarks  they  made,  and  of  course  I
forwarded it to the DG. But also I would like to thank  the  Chairperson  of
the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Housing.  We  have  had   very   constructive
engagement, and in fact I look forward, very soon, to meeting the  portfolio
committee. I had a very heavy schedule and I couldn't do it sooner.

Some of the issues that have been raised in the House therefore, I  believe,
pertain to work in progress. There are no easy answers, and we have to  keep
engaging around them. I am truly happy that the MECs are here because  in  a
sense we will be working very closely as a team and consulting  on  some  of
the very daunting challenges that housing faces. Having said  that,  let  me
then quickly respond. I will give general answers because there  is  no  way
that in the short period of time I can deal in detail with the  issues  that
have been raised.

Hon Semple raised a number of issues. I think I should begin  with  the  one
that was raised by hon C B Herandien, my own  Comrade  Z  Kota  as  well  as
Semple. This has to do with the understanding of provinces. It has  been  an
ongoing challenge. Indeed  24%  is  very  high.  We  will  have  to  find  a
mechanism,  whether  we  incentivise  or  we  challenge,  to  address   this
particular matter. It is an issue that we  were  seized  with  at  the  last
Minmac. I think that we will eventually get some working  strategy  to  deal
with that particular challenge. But we must  know  that  it  is  a  systemic
problem. It has to do with basic infrastructure,  essential  governance  and
even the establishment of layers  of  governance,  both  at  provincial  and
local level. You know local government is a very new  level  of  governance.
That is really a very broad answer.

The deposit taking strategy is to be implemented by  Nurcha.  Again  it's  a
matter that we will come back to and deal with it in detail.  It  should  be
dealt with before the portfolio committee.

The amendment of the Prevention of Illegal Eviction  Act  has  been  drafted
and will be submitted to Cabinet. I would like to assure  you,  hon  member,
that I will move for speedy attention. [Applause.]  We  are  aware  that  it
results in constraints of the rental market. I have to move with  speed  but
the issues are so many.

I must say that the issue of NHBRC exemption for owner-builders is a  matter
that has actually been dealt  with.  In  a  way  I  would  answer,  but  hon
Schneeman I think that we can discuss that matter separately. I  don't  want
to open the debate at this particular moment  when  we  haven't  tabled  the
Community

Reinvestment Bill before Parliament. We will have an engaging debate  around
this particular issue, but I would  say  to  hon  Semple  that  there  is  a
misunderstanding. I am reading it differently. I think that the  whole  idea
is to create an enabling environment to facilitate credit access  for  lower
end of earners. I think that is an important point. But it is a matter  that
we will revisit.

The point that Mr Herandien is raising is that the  transfer  of  houses  is
hampered by the need  to  first  pay  arrears  in  rates  and  taxes.  I  am
informed, and we have looked at section 118 of the  Municipal  Systems  Act,
that it has been amended to allow for the transfer  of  houses  without  the
requirement to first settle outstanding arrears in  taxes  and  rates.  This
has allowed indeed for provinces and local authorities  to  actively  pursue
the transfer of houses.

On the issue of provision of housing for the indigent, disabled, aged,  etc,
that was really part of my input. Effectively, what I was saying was that  a
system has been put in place and Minmac has actually endorsed the  processes
that have been suggested to it. But there is commitment and it is  a  policy
issue in the Department of Housing.

With regard to rural housing as well, we have received  a  lot  of  comments
that do not require answers. We are being urged to address the problems.  We
are being told how acute the problems are, and some of the remarks  actually
come from my own members. And here I  am  talking  about  my  dear  Comrades
Ludwabe, Lishivha and Nash. We are listening to you, and we hear you.  These
are ongoing challenges, but we will address them.

As for the rural communities, there is policy  in  place.  The  question  is
whether this is being implemented or not. I am  hoping  that  the  portfolio
committee will always  assist  us  in  this  regard.  We  carefully  monitor
implementation of policy.

I took short-cuts. I have extensive responses here, but I  do  realise  that
some being work in progress we do need to engage in a forum that will  allow
for an actual debate.

Regarding the question on hostels which has been posed by  hon  Vos,  please
note that in fact there is a policy that has just been  revised  that  looks
at norms and standards in the whole policy of revamping of hostels and  that
policy requires that we should consult. It is a  matter  that  is  receiving
attention and you are of course welcome to raise details with me.

May I then take this opportunity to announce a cocktail and  to  invite  the
stakeholders, all of you in the House to please come  and  join  us  at  the
Marks Building. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The House adjourned at 19:27.
