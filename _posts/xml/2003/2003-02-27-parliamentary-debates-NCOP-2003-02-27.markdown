mosie sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) versoek dat die agb Marthinus van Schalkwyk tans die tweede roterende
       adjunkvoorsitter van die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies van sy  pligte
       onthef word tot tyd en wyl die ernstige aantyging teenoor hom  in  sy
       provinsie besweer word, aangesien die  aansien  van  hierdie  posisie
       deur die huidige toedrag van sake aangetas word;


  (2) kennis neem  dat  hy  vanmiddag,  27  Februarie,  in  die  Wes-Kaapse
       wetgewer gekonfronteer word deur  'n  mosie  van  wantroue  deur  die
       Opposisie en dat hierdie nie 'n stap is wat ligtelik geneem moet word
       nie; en

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that on  the  next  sitting
day I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the Council -


  (1) requests that the hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk, currently  the  second
       rotating deputy chairperson of the National Council of Provinces,  be
       relieved of his duties until such  time  as  the  serious  allegation
       against him in  his  province  has  been  disposed  of,  because  the
       standing of this position is affected adversely by the present  state
       of affairs;


  (2) notes that he is faced this afternoon, 27 February,  in  the  Western
       Cape Legislature by a motion of no confidence by the  Opposition  and
       that this is a step that should not be taken lightly; and


  (3) further notes that serious allegations have  been  made  against  his
       leadership, amongst others that he misled the House.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Deputy Chairperson, on a point of order: The hon  member  is
misleading this House.

  That the Council -


  (1) notes the extremely professional preparatory  work  by  the  National
       Treasury in the run-up to  the  Budget  Speech  by  the  Minister  of

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -

       of the Grootvlei Prison  outside  Bloemfontein  in  order  to  combat
       corruption;
  (2) last year the Grootvlei  Prison  was  often  in  the  news  owing  to
       activities involving  corruption  and  other  irregularities  between
       people in custody and the  staff  that  were  captured  on  video  by
       cameras that had been smuggled in;


  (3) the New NP believes that crime can only  decline  if  corruption  and
       crime within the Correctional Services are  eradicated completely;

       installed in all prisons.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      DIVISION OF REVENUE TO PROVINCES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             THE 2003/04 BUDGET

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Deputy Chairperson, I would have loved to have done  this  in
Setswana, but time is of  the  essence,  so  I  will  move  this  motion  in
English. I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) extends  a  unanimous  vote  of  congratulations  to  Government,  in
       particular the Minister of Finance Comrade Trevor Manuel, on a budget

       the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment in South Africa;


  (2) congratulates members of the Council on contributions made by them in
       this regard;


  (3) notes that this  budget  reflects  the  commitment  of  this  ANC-led

       this country's largest expenditure area;


  (4) further notes that this  budget  considerably  raises  the  level  of
       funding for learning  support  materials,  for  the  maintenance  and
       building of schools and for the restructuring and  transformation  of
       higher education; and


  (5) acknowledges that the  2003/2004  budget  reaffirms  President  Thabo
       Mbeki's assertion that in our country the tide has turned.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  INCREASED SPENDING ON SAFETY AND SECURITY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) welcomes the announcement by  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Mr  Trevor
       Manuel, that spending  on  safety  and  security  will  significantly
       increase, as reflected in this year's budget;

       the further improvement of our criminal justice system and  will,  in
       particular, make more resources available to respond to  the  serious
       challenges faced in terms of improving the protection  of  women  and
       children in the criminal justice process; and


  (3) commends the Minister for his dedication  and  commitment  to  making
       adequate resources available to our security services to enable  them
       to create a safe environment  within  which  social  development  can
       effectively take place.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER MEASURES FOR COMBATING CHILD ABUSE, CHILD TRAFFICKING
                           AND CHILD PROSTITUTION

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon members, it  is  indeed
gratifying that the House gives particular attention to the  problem  facing
our children at this critical time of our history in  South  Africa  and  in
Africa.

Children have become the priority focus of  families,  communities,  members
of  Parliament  and  indeed  of  all  sectors  of  our  society,  and   more
importantly of our  Government.  This  is  important  given  the  fact  that
despite the constitutional rights, as well as the policies  developed  since
the advent of democracy in 1994 in this country,  children  continue  to  be
faced with serious violations of their rights.

Today's debate focuses mainly on combating child  abuse,  child  trafficking
and child prostitution. The question is:  Is  it  not  about  time  that  we
should be confirming the constitutional  rights  of  our  children  in  this
country?

Section 28(1) of our Constitution provides, among other things,  that  every
child has the right to be protected from  maltreatment,  neglect,  abuse  or
degradation,  and  exploitative  labour  practices.  It  also  provides  for
socioeconomic rights for children, including the rights to basic  nutrition,
shelter, basic health care and social services.

The President of this country, in his national  address  in  February  2001,
said that no African child should ever again  in  Africa  walk  in  fear  of
guns, tyrants and  abuse;  no  child  should  experience  hunger,  avoidable
diseases and ignorance; and no African child should ever again feel  ashamed
to be an African.

May I also remind hon members that our country is a signatory to the  United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and  the  African  Charter  on
the Rights and Welfare of the Child. These form the basis of our  strategies
as a country to combat these social ills faced by our country.

The Constitution, policies and programmes developed by the  ANC  since  1994
as a Government recognise that the child occupies a  unique  and  privileged
position in our society. They also recognise that, for  the  realisation  of
the full harmonious  development  of  the  child's  personality,  the  child
should  grow  up  in  a  family,  societal  environment  and  atmosphere  of
happiness, love, care and understanding.

According to the SA Police Service, they  recorded  that  55  580  cases  of
crimes against children were reported during the period 1  July  2001  to  3
September 2001. The SAPS report indicates an increase in reported  cases  of
crimes against children. On the one  hand,  the  number  of  reported  cases
indicates the seriousness of the problem that we face as a country.  On  the
other hand, these numbers refer to the successes of  Government's  awareness
campaigns, such as Break  the  Silence,  Sixteen  Days  of  Activism  of  No
Violence against Children and Women, and Child Protection Week.
It is further reported that international syndicates are using South  Africa
as a transit point for a huge slave trade between the  developing  countries
and developed countries in Europe, the United States of America and  Canada.
According to the police and immigration authorities in South Africa and  the
USA, the main sources of this human  cargo  are  China,  India,  the  Middle
East, former East European countries and many countries in Africa.

Encouraged by stories of milk and honey, children are trafficked to and  via
South Africa to many developed countries. In  South  Africa  these  children
are given false identity  documentation  and  accommodation,  and  then  are
required to pay off their debt to their captors. The human trade  syndicates
have identified Johannesburg as a convenient  centre  to  obtain  fraudulent
identity  documents.  South  Africa  also  has  direct  links,  flights  and
shipping routes to most countries in the developed world.

The issue of increased child prostitution also constitutes one of the  major
challenges the Government of our country has to deal  with.  In  both  urban
and rural areas, especially where poverty and unemployment levels are  high,
child prostitution has manifested itself even more.

In essence, the  problems  of  child  abuse,  child  trafficking  and  child
prostitution are interconnected and interrelated. Therefore,  in  addressing
these problems, the Government  is  developing  a  comprehensive  integrated
policy  and  strategic  framework.  This  integrated  policy  and  strategic
framework of the Government is underpinned by two areas of  focus:  firstly,
prevention and, secondly, combating all crimes against children.

The main emphasis is on prevention. As members, are we aware that  the  main
priority is to fast-track the passing by Parliament of  comprehensive  child
care legislation during the course of this year? This  legislation  provides
for more comprehensive protection of children exposed to  commercial  sexual
exploitation, child pornography and the trafficking of  children  and  other
forms of abuse.

Other legislative measures that seek to promote and protect  the  rights  of
children include the following: The Sexual Offences Act, the  Prevention  of
Domestic Violence Act and the Criminal Procedures Amendment Act. These  Acts
seek, amomgst other things, to give more protection  to  children  from  all
forms of abuse by  providing  the  victims  with  support  and  empowerment,
introducing  stringent  bail  conditions  for  suspects  of  crimes  against
children  and  imposing  tougher   sentences   in   respect   of   convicted
perpetrators.

However, there  are  some  challenges  still  facing  our  criminal  justice
system, which include the enhancement of the investigative capacity  of  the
police in cases of crimes against children,  and  the  state  of  successful
prosecution. To this end, the Government has established special courts  and
specialised police units in almost all regional  districts.  The  Government
has put in place several measures to  enhance  the  protection  of  children
from  conditions  of  vulnerability  and  abuse.  These  programmes  include
poverty relief, social security  awareness  campaigns,  community  diversion
programmes for children in conflict with the law and moral regeneration.

These interventions are based on an integrated  social  prevention  strategy
in which individual families, communities and all sectors  of  society  have
to work together in partnership to prevent crimes against  children.  It  is
our hope, therefore, that this debate will further  enhance  these  efforts.
Accordingly, this  debate  should  go  beyond  the  limits  of  intellectual
discussion and make concrete proposals that will further enhance  our  goals
of providing integrated and sustainable services to our children. We owe  it
to them.

I hope after this  debate  hon  members  will  participate  in  the  broader
campaign that  is  there  to  ensure  that  all  children  get  whatever  is
necessary for and that is being provided by Government. If  each  and  every
member in each and every constituency were  able  to  register,  during  the
course of this year, at least 300 children in his or  her  own  constituency
or province, we would have  gone  a  long  way  towards  ensuring  that  all
children under the age of seven are registered before the  end  of  December
this year.

We still have at least 1 000 000 to 1 500 000 children who are  entitled  to
receive the child support grant who do not have it at the present moment.  I
think that as a Government and as a people, we have promised  that  we  will
ensure that each and every child is able to receive that grant in  time  and
in dignity. But, more importantly, I would plead with hon  members  in  this
House to be part and parcel of  the  bigger  campaign  to  ensure  that  all
children between the ages of seven and eight who qualify for the  grant  are
registered this year so that they may receive the grant.
Members are aware that the Government has agreed, after  it  was  instructed
by the ANC conference in Stellenbosch, to increase that age from 7 to 14.  I
think it behoves every member to ensure that we are able  to  register  each
and every child in the phase that has been  agreed  within  the  next  three
years, so that they may receive the grant that he or  she  is  entitled  to,
with their family, and also to ensure that all  communities  participate  in
the nutrition programme that Government is extending.

We have heard the Budget Speech yesterday. I think we  should  be  part  and
parcel of ensuring that the noble aims that this  Government  is  trying  to
put across reach the poorest of the poor. With that, thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M E SURTY: Deputy Chairperson, let me at the very outset  thank  the  hon
Ministers for their presence here today. The fact that they both  wished  to
be present here is a clear indication of the  seriousness  with  which  they
treat the matter. We are, indeed, grateful.

We know about the passion and commitment that they have for  the  vulnerable
sectors of our society - the youth, the aged and persons with  disabilities.
They have publicly and privately demonstrated their will and  commitment  in
ensuring that these very important and  vulnerable  sectors  are  protected,
both  in  terms  of  the  law  and  policy,  and  in  terms  of   Government
intervention. We thank them for that.

We are also aware that the hon Minister will have to  address  the  National
Assembly very shortly, and he will, at some time,  and  at  his  convenience
and his judgment, be leaving us.

I'm sure the hon Minister Dr Skweyiya would be very  pleased  to  note  that
next month, as we go to our provincial week, the key focus of our  oversight
is on the implementation of social grants. This will occur not only  in  one
province, ie the Eastern Cape, but also in  all  nine  provinces,  where  we
would be engaging with various  provincial  governments,  local  governments
and regional directors of Home Affairs.  We've  also  discovered  the  close
nexus between the issuing of identity documents and the  payment  of  social
grants. We hope that we'll be  able  to  provide  him  with  a  consolidated
report which incorporates the findings, not only of the NCOP,  but  also  of
the provincial legislatures and local government which may be  of  some  use
to the hon Minister.

Last week on 19 February the English newspaper The Guardian carried a  story
with the headlines  ``  S  Africa  at  centre  of  child  sex  trade''.  The
newspaper article continued, and I quote:


  South Africa has become a market for children sold into prostitution from
  Africa ...

 ... as indicated by the hon Minister ...


  Europe and the Far East ... Children from  Angola,  Mozambique,  Senegal,
  Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, Eastern Europe, Thailand and China are  being
  either lured or kidnapped to the country to  become  prostitutes  in  the
  streets of Johannesburg and Cape Town.

The newspaper  article  was  based  on  a  new  United  Nations  report.  In
September last year  a  United  Nations  Special  Rapporteur  visited  South
Africa at the invitation of Government to  investigate  child  abuse,  child
rape and child prostitution. Its final report was released last week and  it
will be presented to the United Nations Human Rights  Commission  in  Geneva
next month. We in South  Africa  should  take  this  report  very  seriously
indeed.
I will come back to its recommendations and measure  them  against  positive
steps that have been taken by Government in this regard. But  I  first  need
to say a few words about trafficking and the sale of children in general.

In so far as trafficking in children  is  concerned,  trafficking  in  human
beings is one of the greatest human  rights  violations  of  our  time.  But
trafficking in children  for  sexual  exploitation,  forced  labour,  forced
marriages and forced adoption is also the world's fastest  growing  criminal
business. It has dangerous  links  to  trafficking  in  drugs,  arms,  money
laundering, and even terrorism.

No region is immune. No country acting alone can put an end  to  trafficking
in human beings. We need a co-ordinated approach that  integrates  migration
policy issues, judicial  co-operation,  law  enforcement  and  human  rights
concerns,  while  at  the  same  time  being  sensitive   to   the   extreme
vulnerability of the victims.

Research shows that human trafficking is particularly rife  in  postconflict
areas, whether it is in countries of origin, transit or  destination,  or  a
combination of all  three.  The  United  Nations  has  gathered  significant
information about demand and supply  chains  and  about  the  networks  that
organise and facilitate trafficking. The United Nations  Special  Rapporteur
expanded on this information during his research trip here last year.  These
are some of his findings and recommendations.

On the human  rights  situation  generally,  that  is  pertaining  to  South
Africa, he said, and I quote:


  The Government of South Africa has made tremendous efforts in  the  eight
  years since the ending of  apartheid  to  begin  creating  a  culture  of
  respect for human rights in the country. A remarkable level of  progress,
  both in terms of legislation and policy development, as well as access to
  water, sanitation and electricity in many areas has now been achieved.

The hon Minister has also reflected on the rights of  the  child  which  are
entrenched in our Constitution.

That is certainly welcome praise. His  specific  comments  on  children  are
less welcome. Concerning the rape of children, he had the following to say:


  The rape of children, including very young children and babies  in  South
  Africa, is not a new phenomenon in  the  country.  The  increase  in  the
  reporting of rape  cases  is  a  welcome  development,  compared  to  the
  situation prior to the ending of the apartheid  regime  in  1994,  before
  which time a very few of the many rapes occurring were ever reported.

His analysis is very similar to the recommendations of this House, and I  do
not intend repeating them as they are on public record.

Concerning the sale of children, this is what he said:


  The issue of trafficking of children in South Africa  has  received  very
  little attention, and ``trafficking'' itself is not yet recognised  as  a
  criminal offence.

We are,  indeed,  grateful  to  hear  the  hon  Minister  talking  about  an
integrated systematic approach to deal with  this  particular  issue.  Where
there is legislation, it might mean that we have to  extend  the  boundaries
of legislation to incorporate this aspect, particularly with regard  to  the
Criminal Procedure Act. The report continues, and I quote:
  However, there are reports of South Africa becoming both a receiving  and
  transit country for child victims of trafficking, both from  other  parts
  of Africa and from Asian countries. The  very  desperate  food  shortage,
  particularly in countries bordering South Africa, is contributing  to  an
  increase in trafficking of children.

Concerning child prostitution, these are his findings:


  High levels of poverty coupled with domestic abuse are forcing  children,
  mainly girls, into prostitution. As the children's grant  ends  when  the
  child reaches the age of seven, many children drop out of school as their
  parents are unable to afford to pay school fees ...

... and family friends might receive the children and offer to  assist  them
in exchange for sex.

The Special Rapporteur  made  certain  recommendations,  and  I  think  it's
important to look  at  these  recommendations  and  to  do  so  against  the
background of the positive and concrete steps that Government  has  made  in
this regard.

The first recommendation is, and I quote:
  Serious efforts need to be made to alleviate poverty and unemployment, as
  many acts of sexual violence against children appear to result from anger
  and boredom. Access to free adult education and skills training  must  be
  facilitated.

It is very clear that central to the programme of Government - and  this  is
my comment - is pushing back the frontiers of poverty. In his state  of  the
nation address the hon President clearly indicated the many  ways  in  which
it has to be done and in which it is being done, either through  legislation
or policy, in extending the social  grant  system,  in  targeting  areas  of
poverty, in creating better job opportunities, in  creating  black  economic
empowerment, etc - the list goes on and on.  In  so  far  as  Government  is
concerned, it has dealt with this matter with great resolve.

The second recommendation says, and I quote:


  The grant of R130,00 per month which is currently given by the Department
  of Social Department to poor children up  to  the  age  of  7  should  be
  extended ... and that payment of school fees should be considered.]
  In this regard, again, we have a positive development. In April 2002  the
  child grant was, in fact,  R130,00.  It  increased  in  October  2002  to
  R140,00, and it will progressively increase in February 2003 to R160,00.


  In addition, as the hon Minister has correctly indicated, the age will be
  progressively increased to 14 years, which,  in  fact,  deals  adequately
  with the recommendation to show that Government has dealt with this issue
  with serious intent.


  The third recommendation is that outreach work needs to be done  to  help
  children in prostitution, who are usually reluctant to come  forward  for
  assistance, believing  that  they  would  be  criminally  convicted.  The
  position of Government, again, is very, very clear in so far as  this  is
  concerned. It is the view of Government, through the  Law  Commission  in
  any way, that we should not criminalise child prostitution  and  that  we
  should provide shelter. I know the hon Minister of Social Development  is
  looking meticulously into this particular area, and  it  is  an  area  of
  great concern that he has reflected on.


  In so far as moral regeneration is concerned, that is another  integrated
  effort which has cascaded to the provinces and local  government  and  to
  all structures of the ANC where we are asked to volunteer in dealing with
  the social ills of our society and particularly help vulnerable children.


  The fourth recommendation is that although there are many very  different
  and committed actors working  on  behalf  of  children's  rights  in  the
  country,  there  are  problems  concerning  the  co-ordination  of   this
  activity.


  Here, again, the Government has especially dedicated a position,  ie  the
  Minister in the Presidency, to deal with this matter.  The  hon  Minister
  Essop Pahad is a spokesperson on the rights  of  the  most  vulnerable  -
  children, persons with disabilities and women. This year  this  has  been
  replicated in all nine provinces. Such a department exists in the  office
  of each Premier and it has a particular focus on this matter.


  But one of the recommendations that is made in addition is that we should
  consider a national centre on child abuse.  It  is  one  matter  that  we
  should perhaps give thought to because we believe it will  be  useful  in
  that it will co-ordinate the activities of nongovernmental and community-
  based organisations in terms of ensuring their effectiveness, and it will
  assist the Minister in terms of his executive oversight and co-ordination
  and integration of this particular issue.


  Although we have signed the Optional Protocol to the  Convention  on  the
  Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child
  Pornography in this Chamber not very long ago, we still have not ratified
  the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress  and  Punish  Trafficking  in  Persons,
  Especially  Women  and  Children,  supplementing   the   United   Nations
  Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. It is our request  that
  we give urgent attention to this matter, because it deals  directly  with
  this particular issue.


  The Child Sexual Abuse Task Team - made up of various  committees,  given
  the spate of crimes against children  -  met  in  Parliament  and  public
  hearings were held. The task team recommended, and I quote:


... that further investigation into international trafficking  in  children,
child prostitution and child pornography be  commissioned  by  the  relevant
statutory bodies in order to obtain a clear picture of the  extent  of  this
problem ... these bodies should brief the relevant parliamentary  committees
on their findings.

The question or the challenge that faces this House and the Other  House  is
to what extent we have pursued the matter and what the developments  are  in
obtaining more empirical data on this particular issue.

The task team also made a list of recommendations in relation to  the  issue
of trafficking in children. Amongst other things, it said that there  should
be a general provision that  criminalises  trafficking  in  children.  I  am
aware that the Minister of Justice, in consultation  with  the  Minister  of
Social Development, has, in fact, proposed such amendment, which  says  that
if a court  finds  that  a  child  has  been  exploited  or  trafficked  for
commercial use, the parent of such a child must be deprived of  the  custody
and care of such a child. Here again Government has taken positive steps  in
this regard, and it is an  initiative  and  policy  development  within  the
Government.
It deals with various other recommendations which we should look  carefully,
and I believe that many very useful recommendations have been made  by  this
task team. However, the challenge that faces this House and the Other  House
is  to  what  extent  we  have  pursued,   monitored   and   ensured   their
implementation. In fact, this is what  the  Minister  said  in  his  opening
address, and that is that the policies are in place  and  the  laws  are  in
place, but to what extent  are  we  ensuring  that  implementation  of  this
exercise takes place.

The following relates to a very important area that we have  discussed  here
previously, ie a sex  offenders  register.  While  talking  about  the  task
team's recommendation, it  is  important  to  refer  to  the  sex  offenders
register that Mrs Pandor, the Chairperson, proposed  last  year.  Name  them
and shame them -  that  is  the  object  of  the  register.  The  task  team
recommended the following:


  ... that the establishment of a register of sex offenders be investigated
  by a task team  comprising  the  Departments  of  Correctional  Services,
  Safety and Security, Social Development and  Justice  and  Constitutional
  Development, and that this task team report to the relevant parliamentary
  committees.
As public representatives we have a  responsibility  to  follow  up  on  the
recommendations of this task team and to urge the executive to take  special
care of this. The Chairperson of the NCOP  has,  in  fact,  called  for  the
establishment of such a register. We believe it will be a  useful  tool  and
aid for victim empowerment and will allow people the protection that  is  so
necessary. We have to focus on our children, and a  separate  register  will
show that we mean to do just that.

Mr P M NKETU (Free State): Deputy Chairperson, hon Ministers present in  the
House,  members  of  the  House   and   colleagues   from   the   provincial
legislatures,  the  debate  in  the  House  affords  us  an  opportunity  as
provinces to take stock of what has  happened  during  previous  years,  and
therefore  demands  of  us  to  reflect  on  the  challenges  and   problems
confronting us.

Nine years after the watershed April 27 elections, given the  depth  of  the
problems we inherited, created over a number of centuries by the  system  of
colonialism and apartheid, it is clear that it will take time and  a  united
national  effort  to  eradicate  lawlessness,  homelessness,   landlessness,
unemployment, HIV/Aids and poverty in our country.

With the  eradication  of  the  above  as  our  urgent  task,  we  must  pay
particular attention to close  relationships  between  extreme  poverty  and
particular crimes. This relates in particular to violence against women  and
children, murder and substance abuse. Though crime  in  general  is  on  the
decline, we are deeply concerned about the increase in social fabric  crimes
in our province. We in the Free State are investigating the  possibility  of
establishing and increasing,  in  the  coming  financial  year,  specialised
centres and shelters for victims of crime and abuse. These centres would  be
used  by  nongovernmental  and  community-based   organisations,   including
volunteers.

Violence against women and girls  should  always  be  regarded  as  a  human
rights issue. Domestic violence is not a concern but goes to  the  roots  of
unequal power relations between men and  women  in  society.  Discriminatory
sociocultural  attitudes  and  economic   inequalities   reinforce   women's
subordinate place in society.

It is therefore the responsibility of the state to  put  in  place  a  legal
framework within which the vulnerable in society are protected and  decisive
action is taken against perpetrators. In the past few  years  we  have  seen
steady progress in the provision of services for abused women and  children,
and the training of law enforcement officials, members of the judiciary  and
social workers.

However, legal systems and  increased  budgets  alone  will  not  address  a
situation which is rooted in history and tradition. I also want  to  include
religion, as I explain further. There have  to  be  fundamental  changes  in
attitudes. Society must respond with moral outrage to all forms of  domestic
violence and child abuse. Education, in this regard, should start at a  very
early  age  and  teachers,  spiritual  leaders,  traditional   leaders   and
nongovernmental  organisations  should  take  the  lead   to   ensure   that
programmes are put in place to reverse current trends.

HIV/Aids is having a serious impact on our communities. The burden  of  care
for people living with HIV/Aids and  Aids  orphans  falls  very  heavily  on
women, and some opt for prostitution, not as a choice  but  as  a  means  of
survival.

The rights of children is one area that remains undermined in  our  country,
despite our signing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

What started as a routine divorce case ended with a High Court judge  making
legal history by refusing to play the role of nanny to the soul of  a  child
whose parents were splitting. It was typical legal action such  as  is  seen
thousands of times a year in the courts, usually of  interest  only  to  the
couple involved and their families. The  judge  noticed  a  paragraph  which
stated that both parties undertook to educate the  minor  in  the  Apostolic
Church and to ensure that the child  participates  fully  in  all  religious
activities of the church. The judge refused to incorporate the paragraph  as
a court order and reminded the court that children have the right to  choose
their own faith.

In conclusion, I want to indicate that social disintegration, the  breakdown
of families, the impact of poverty, substance abuse,  neglect  and  HIV/Aids
are leading to larger numbers of children being orphaned  and  others  being
trafficked. It is therefore a challenge that rests upon provinces to  ensure
that members of the community protect the  rights  of  children.  They  must
ensure that people  who  abuse  children  get  harsher  sentences  and  that
juveniles under the age of 14 are accommodated in places of safety,  not  in
jail. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers Dr Pahad and Dr Skweyiya,  hon
colleagues,  the  children  of  the  world  are  innocent,  vulnerable   and
dependent. They are also curious, active and full of hope.  Their  childhood
should be one of joy and peace; of  playing,  learning  and  growing.  Their
future should be shaped in harmony  and  co-operation.  Their  lives  should
mature as they broaden their perspectives and gain new experiences.

In reality children across the globe continue to experience  a  multiplicity
of human rights violations, often at the hands of the very  people  who  are
supposed to nurture and protect  them.  Some  children  are  sometimes  even
violated by people whom they trust. Our country is no exception.  In  recent
months reports of incidents of sexual abuse against children  have  been  on
the increase. There is little guarantee, if any, that they will find  safety
at home, at school, or even at church.

We read reports of children being  sexually  abused  by  their  parents  and
other family members. This is a sad indictment on us all, and should put  to
shame any society that values its children.

Although various structures at Government level are in place to address  the
issue of  sexual  abuse  of  children,  laws  and  policies  are  not  fully
implemented yet. This can be attributed to a number of factors, which  range
from limited resources to a lack of  knowledge  about  the  nature  of  this
issue. There is an assumption in South  Africa  that  violence  against  and
sexual abuse of women and children are personal  and  private  matters,  and
therefore the political impetus to address this is not  as  crucial  as  the
broader, global aspects of politics and economics.

The multidimensional phenomenon of sexual abuse of children in South  Africa
is beginning to receive much more attention than was the case in  the  past.
The formation of various Government departments  to  address  the  different
aspects of South African society has seen the role-players working in  often
isolated  and  compartmentalised  entities  with  their  focus  on  specific
issues. Therefore, this becomes rather damaging, as one needs  to  view  the
issue in a holistic way, as it impacts on the legal,  social,  economic  and
health rights of children.

It is therefore important that all sectors monitor  the  trends  and  liaise
with one another regarding the most effective ways to combat  this  problem.
In this way, there must be mutual interconnected relationships  between  the
various departments and other stakeholders.

Greater awareness programmes in communities must  be  established,  such  as
the  following.  Courts  should  provide   qualified   social   workers   or
psychologists, trained to work with abused children in a  sensitive  manner.
The Child Protection Unit needs to employ  more  trained  personnel  in  the
area of child abuse. Educators who are perpetrators should  not  be  granted
bail, and not be allowed to teach  again.  Developmental  programmes  should
address  the  needs  of  communities  holistically,  paying   attention   to
strengthening  social  cohesion,  making  neighbourhoods  safe,   supporting
vulnerable families and tracking developments in particular communities.

Developmental programmes, aimed at offering umemployed  mothers  employment,
should have built-in mechanisms through which provision  is  made  for  safe
childcare facilities for the children  of  those  mothers  at  work.  Social
ills, such as alcohol and other substance dependency,  should  be  addressed
as part of a  broader  preventative  strategy  that  focuses  on  rebuilding
communities  and  strengthening  families.  A  sustained  public   awareness
campaign should be launched by Government and NGOs  in  order  to  highlight
the importance of the community's and the  individual's  responsibility  for
the safety of all children in all communities.

A lot has been done, and must still be done, by the people of  South  Africa
in this field. It is our hope and prayer that our  country  and  communities
become a safer and better place for our children, so that they can  grow  up
in joy and peace. We owe it to them. Let's love  and  adore  them.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Thank you Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  members.
Human rights belong to each and every one of us, including  children.  Abuse
of children in any way is therefore a violation of human rights.  Protection
against any kind of abuse, including sexual abuse, is not a  privilege,  but
a right any child is entitled to. It  is  therefore  our  responsibility  as
Government, as Parliament, as civil society and as NGOs to work together  to
ensure that the rights of our children are protected.

Our Constitution  states  clearly  that  every  child  has  a  right  to  be
protected from malnutrition, neglect, abuse and  degradation.  The  Minister
has already said that. Further, the United Nations Convention on the  Rights
of the Child, which was ratified by South Africa in 1995, reflects that  the
state shall protect children from physical and mental harm, neglect,  sexual
abuse and exploitation. Clearly, abuse of children undermines all  the  laws
we put in place as Parliament to protect our children.

The question, therefore, is: What is it that we have to do  to  ensure  that
our children are free  from  this  kind  of  abuse?  What  is  it  that  the
different spheres of governance  and  the  various  departments  can  do  to
ensure that our society is safe for our children? It is every child's  right
to grow up in a  healthy  and  stable  environment,  filled  with  love  and
security, both financial and emotional. It is  every  child's  right  to  be
nurtured, valued and cared for.

Children are  supposed  to  be  protected,  guided,  taught  the  difference
between what is right and what is wrong, given a chance to be children,  and
not to be robbed of their youth and innocence, in order for them to grow  up
to be responsible adults who will have the  wisdom  to  distinguish  between
what is wrong and what is right. Ironically, children are abused  and  raped
every  day  in  our  democracy.  Child  prostitution,  sexual  abuse,  child
trafficking and child labour are alive and on the rise within our borders.

This makes one question the very direction our country  is  moving  towards,
for the children are our future, our hope for tomorrow. If we destroy  them,
we are destroying the future of our nation.

The number of reported cases has escalated to  a  point  where  one  wonders
what is happening to our society. Statistics released  from  the  SA  Police
Service's Child Protection Unit indicate that 15 732  cases  of  child  rape
were reported in 1998, and in 2002 the figure stood at 25 000. This  clearly
confirms that there has been a sharp increase  in  the  number  of  reported
cases of child abuse since 1998.

Bearing in mind the number of reported cases, it is of great essence to  ask
ourselves the following questions, regardless of which political parties  we
belong to, because I believe that abuse of children is a concern to  all  of
us. How many unreported cases are there? How  many  children  are  not  even
aware of their rights, who are even scared to say something, for  they  fear
that they might be harmed? How many victims are not  receiving  counselling,
what is their fate and how many children are crying in silence with  no  one
to listen to them?  Researchers  and  organisations  working  with  children
suggest that the number of reported cases represents only a fraction of  the
real incidence of abuse.

Social workers and officers of  the  Child  Protection  Unit  estimate  that
there are 28 000 child prostitutes in South Africa.  For  example,  in  Cape
Town alone, the Sex Worker Advocacy Task Force estimates  that  25%  of  sex
workers are children. There has also been a sharp rise  in  the  trafficking
of children for sexual exploitation.

The question still stands: What can we do as Government, as  Parliament,  as
leadership, as  communities,  as  parents,  as  teachers  and  as  religious
leaders to ensure that this  victimisation  comes  to  an  end?  Surely,  we
cannot sit back and do nothing and hope that things  will  change  in  their
own time!
It is a fact that there are many laws protecting  the  rights  of  children,
but  the  irony  is  that  the  number  of  these  incidents  is  increasing
regardless. One can mention the Sexual Offences Act, Act 23 of  1957,  which
prohibits people from having sexual intercourse with children; the Film  and
Publications Act, Act 65 of 1996, which makes it  a  punishable  offence  to
create, produce, import or be in possession of a publication  or  film  that
contains a visual presentation of  child  pornography.  The  list  goes  on.
Where are we failing our children? If our children cannot feel safe at  home
and in their neighbourhoods, where else can they  feel  safe?  What  is  the
root cause of this moral decay in our society?

It is clear that there is a major  need  for  a  workable,  sustainable  and
comprehensive  strategy   to   combat   sexual   abuse,   exploitation   and
prostitution of children. There is a further need for more co-ordination  of
services between different spheres of governance, departments  and  agencies
to work  together  in  an  integrated  manner,  for  both  preventative  and
protective measures and interventions,  to  ensure  that  the  incidents  of
child abuse come to an end, and also that appropriate care is available  for
child survivors of these kinds of abuses, for,  as  we  all  know,  violence
begets violence. Therefore, the abused become  the  abusers  and  the  cycle
goes on.

The children of  today  are  our  future.  They  are  our  present  and  our
tomorrow. They are the future leaders of tomorrow. If we invest in them,  we
are investing in the future and stability of our society, but if we  destroy
them, we are destroying our future, the very nerve of our  society.  Let  us
value our children, protect them, love them and not abuse them.

Let us join hands as a country and fight child  prostitution,  sexual  abuse
and sexual exploitation of children.  Let  us  rid  South  Africa  of  these
demons. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Hon Chairperson and hon Minister, I have  not  yet  found  the
emotional character to look at child abuse head on.  When  we  screened  the
video of baby Tshepang  in  our  caucus,  it  just  served  to  increase  my
admiration for  health  workers  and  other  individuals  who  get  directly
involved. It is that kind of compassion and strength which helps to  address
this horror.

Looking back on history, we must conclude that children  are  in  many  ways
better off today than they were before. For  example,  lifespans  have  been
increased, and human rights have become a legislated philosophy, notably  in
our Constitution. Working conditions have improved and schooling has  become
a matter of law rather than choice.

Despite this, the capacity for abusive behaviour seems an integral  part  of
the human psyche. This is evidenced in the rape of babies where we  are  the
leading perpetrators, exploitative child labour, the  alarming  increase  in
child prostitution and evidence of child trafficking and slavery. The  ever-
present variety of child abuse where persons who should be a  child's  first
line of defence against maltreatment  are  the  perpetrators,  is  the  most
familiar.

Two exacerbating factors to these evils prevail. The abuse of  children  is,
firstly, often tied to the need for money, either  for  survival  or  greed,
and secondly, children are often abused in a familial  pattern.  The  abuser
was herself abused.  These  are  two  factors  which  we  are  not  entirely
helpless to contain.

Economic growth, with jobs, money for schools, health and welfare  services,
provides a society in which caregivers are not  left  without  resources  to
care for a child. It is therefore essential that we allow economic  policies
which can supply jobs  and  install  a  government  service  which  delivers
unfailingly on welfare programmes.

The  issue  of  abused  children  becoming  abusing  parents  must  also  be
countered. It may be a case  of  counselling  services  or  additional  care
facilities. I do  not  know  all  the  answers.  But  in  the  case  of  sex
offenders, the DA is in favour of - as is our Chairperson  Mrs  Pandor,  and
as we have stated in  this  Council  on  previous  occasions  and  has  been
repeated by the Chief Whip - a register of offenders  being  kept.  Even  if
this is a flawed aid, whatever measures can be taken to  prevent  one  child
from being abused must be embarked upon.

What I also know is that all these measures cost money, and that  goes  back
to the need for economic growth and proper analysis of public  spending  via
a social policy agenda. This  is  a  way  of  ensuring  consistency  between
social commitments and allocated resources. It is  putting  children  before
guns. It is an aspect of the Budget process which has not been  sufficiently
explored.

There is another measure for combating child exploitation and  that  is  the
proper oversight role and commitment of parliamentarians. I have with  me  a
report on the conditions and activities of child protection  units  produced
by the DP MP Mike Waters, who personally visited  all  45  child  protection
units across the country over a period of three  months.  I  highly  commend
that it be read by all who have a genuine interest in the subject.

I would like to quote directly from his report, the  five  areas  which  the
report suggests can be addressed by Government as a matter of urgency.

The first is the insufficient number of units nationally  and  the  shortage
of officers at the CPUs, which are far short of  the  optimal  figures  that
the police themselves have determined. The second issue  is  the  proportion
of  officers  that  have  not  undergone  child   protection   training   or
specialised training of any kind. The third concern is  the  physical  state
of repair of  CPU  buildings,  and  the  general  facilities  and  resources
available at CPUs, including office  space,  telephones,  vehicles,  support
and forensic services. The fourth  problem  is  the  high  number  of  cases
officers have to investigate, sometimes more than 100 per officer, in  these
stressful conditions. The fifth issue is the unco-ordinated  nature  of  the
various Government departments, especially Health, Welfare and  the  justice
system, which  leads  to  the  increased  victimisation  of  the  young  and
vulnerable.

The DA and the public have been assured that the ANC is doing all it can  to
help child victims. The evidence proves otherwise. It is  all  our  children
who  are  at  risk.  We  all  need  to  take  Mike   Waters'   example   and
recommendations to heart. [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, honourable House and hon Minister, nothing  in
this world is more precious than our children. They  are  our  flesh  or  it
could be said that they are ourselves. In biblical terms we are required  to
love our neighbours as we love ourselves, but I contend  that  our  children
are much more than our neighbours. Therefore, they deserve to be loved  much
more than ourselves and our neighbours.

Our African idiom, which I suppose should have been  adopted  and  owned  by
all South African populations, is ``your children are  my  children  and  my
children  are  your  children''.  Anything  that  disturbs  the  peace   and
wellbeing of our children is bound to disturb and hurt  us  beyond  measure.
In the countryside or rural areas, where I am from, when a fire  breaks  out
and starts ravaging the veld, we run to the opposite side, where  we  kindle
another fire which would then burn towards the  oncoming  fire.  When  these
two fires meet, they die off. This is the best way to deal with a fire.

Another idiom goes: Molelo wa tladi o tingwa ka o mongwe. [A lightning  fire
is extinguished by another lightning fire.] This means that  a  fire  caused
by lightning is extinguished by another  lightning  fire.  This  in  essence
means we should fight fire with fire. We should be firm  and  uncompromising
when it comes  to  the  wellbeing  of  our  children.  We  should  deal  the
tormentors of  our  children  appropriate  blows  that  would  deter  future
tormentors from repeating the same evil and satanic deeds.

I find it difficult to imagine a situation where nine males rape a  15-year-
old child, as was reported in the news media recently. This is  unimaginable
and intolerable. No parent would tolerate this kind of behaviour. In a  past
debate on rape I referred to women's organisations being so angry that  they
even recommended castration of perpetrators as the ultimate solution to  the
problem. I had also indicated my support for  this  measure.  This  is  very
serious and I stand by what I  said  then.  If  a  man  denies  himself  the
enjoyment of the good things in life provided by nature, then  he  alone  is
to blame.

However, taking cognisance of the various  degrees  of  child  abuse,  child
trafficking  and  child  prostitution,  one  would  propose   further   that
consideration should be given to  our  legislative  framework  to  determine
whether or not it is adequate to deal with these crimes and to  request  the
courts to apply correspondingly heavy fines and sentences that  would  deter
prospective criminals.

I am afraid that from my observation these crimes are on the  increase,  and
the more we are being  considerate,  the  worse  the  position  is  getting.
[Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Deputy Chairperson, once more  we  are  debating  this  topic
which is essentially about the rights of children.  I  am  quite  sure  that
there is a national consensus across  party-political  lines,  in  terms  of
commitment and vision as to how we build a united front in dealing with  the
issue of child abuse generally, and more specifically  the  issue  of  child
trafficking and  child  prostitution.  Everyone  has  spoken  and  there  is
general agreement in the House.

There is no doubt that our Government is  committed  to  dealing  with  this
question of the  rights  of  children.  Yesterday's  Budget  speech  by  the
Minister of Finance attested to Government's commitment by making  a  larger
allocation,  amongst  other  things,  to  the  social  security  grant   for
children. The issues  of  poverty  and  underdevelopment  are  intrinsically
linked to the issues of abuse, prostitution  and  trafficking  of  children.
There is no doubt about that.

I want to disagree that there is an increase in child abuse in our  country.
I don't think that is a correct approach. The correct approach must be  that
before 27 April 1994 no  human  rights  culture  existed  in  this  country.
Reporting, and our entire criminal  justice  system  were  not  tailored  to
addressing issues  regarding  the  fundamental  rights  of  our  people  and
children in particular. There was no  reporting  about  these  things.  They
have been happening in silence. The fact that we have more reports on  these
cases is an indication that our country, our  people,  our  Government  have
been mobilised. They are conscious  of  this  issue  and  are  beginning  to
report these issues. I think we need to be proud of that. It  is  not  cause
for alarm but a positive development.

However, more must be done. I don't think  the  Government  alone  can  deal
with this question. How do  we  translate  the  consensus  visible  in  this
debate  today  into  a  national  front,  in  our  own  constituencies   and
communities, to mobilise our communities, and all  social  partners  into  a
practical programme of action to deal with issues that are related to  child
trafficking, prostitution and abuse? I think that is the point that we  need
to examine beyond this debate. I think that is fundamental.

I agree with everything Mr Tlhagale has  said,  but  I  don't  think  it  is
biblical to castrate a person. The Bible says: ``Thou shalt  not  kill.''  I
think we are quite correct to say that  we  need  to  tighten  our  criminal
justice system with much more effective sentencing, but  not  castration.  I
don't think that is the correct approach. I don't think it will address  the
problem; rather, it is emotional and self-serving.

I really want to applaud in particular my colleague  from  the  Free  State,
Sandra  Botha,  for  her  positiveness.  The  debate  was  not  clouded   by
ideological and party-political lines. I think there is  consensus.  We  are
debating this issue also in  memory  of  the  late  president  of  the  ANC,
Comrade Oliver Tambo, a father, a leader and a combatant, who has said  that
a nation that does not value its children does not  deserve  its  future.  I
think all of us have said that. Hon Priscilla has said  that,  hon  Tlhagale
has said that and the Chief Whip has said that. We are doing this in  memory
of the legacy of that giant of our continent, Comrade Oliver Tambo. I  thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, firstly I would like  to  thank
the NCOP on behalf of Minister  Skweyiya  and  myself  for  inviting  us  to
participate in this debate. Secondly, I thank all  the  speakers  who  spoke
here this afternoon.

Perhaps it would be more appropriate to start with hon member Mr  Setona.  I
would like to agree with him  that  I  think  there  is  national  consensus
developing on this issue, which cuts across party-political lines. It  would
seem to me that, in the national interest, this is quite critical,  that  in
so far as we have this national consensus we should protect and develop  it.
The question of dealing  with  child  abuse,  child  trafficking  and  child
prostitution is not one  that  should  be  reduced  to  party-political  bun
fights, and the fact that the NCOP debate today is contributing to  that,  I
think, is a very good thing.

With regard to the suggestion made by the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Council  on
looking at setting up a national centre on child  abuse,  let  me  say  that
this will be given serious  consideration.  I  spoke  to  Minister  Skweyiya
before he left. He says that members can be assured that they will  look  at
this.

There is no doubt that there is an increase in the number of cases that  are
reported, and it may well be that  a  whole  set  of  other  cases  are  not
reported. A great deal of child abuse occurs within  the  family  or  indeed
within the  environment  of  the  family.  It  is  an  ongoing  struggle  to
convince, first of all, our  own  children  that  they  should  report  this
abuse, but also to convince ourselves that where our own  adult  members  of
the family may well be responsible  for  or  involved  in  child  abuse,  we
should not protect them. Part of the problem is that we protect  members  of
our families when we know or are aware that  they  may  be  responsible  for
child abuse.

As a country we do not have an adequate picture of the nature and extent  of
child abuse, neglect and exploitation. We rely heavily on data collected  by
the SAPS, and even this  data  needs  elaboration  and  interpretation.  The
paucity of data  carries  with  it  the  danger  that  too  often  knee-jerk
reactions to anecdotal evidence form the basis for policy and  intervention.
We must be resolute in dealing with child abuse but  not  be  panicked  into
applying futile quick-fix remedies, including castration.

Moreover,  the  care  of  the  child  can  never  be  simply  a   Government
responsibility, and I think this has come out here today  very  clearly.  It
concerns a broad spectrum of civil society. Everyone must play their part.

It is a new struggle that faces South Africa, rooted in our  Constitution  -
a struggle  that  touches  every  individual  and  family,  every  religious
institution, every club and every  school.  The  National  Child  Protection
Register, which has been mentioned in this debate, established in  terms  of
the Child Care Act, is in its pilot phase.  We  need  to  ensure  that  this
register is functioning  as  a  comprehensive  tool  for  policy-making  and
intervention.

Let us  not  forget  those  who  are  particularly  vulnerable,  those  with
disabilities, girl children, and those in far-flung rural  areas  where  the
levels of neglect and abuse present bigger challenges. For those of  us  who
live here in the Cape, just  go  to  some  of  these  wine  farms  over  the
weekend, and one will see the abuse that women and  children  are  subjected
to every weekend. When those adult males are  drunk,  they  take  out  their
frustrations and everything else on the women and the children.

Our  vision  should  be  to  create  and  ensure  safe,  secure  and  caring
environments for our children, both at home  and  at  school,  and  wherever
children gather. The immediate challenges are to  reduce  the  incidence  of
child abuse, neglect and exploitation in whatever form. We must ensure  that
the rights of children are not just a vague national objective but  also  an
individual adult responsibility and a realisable experience for  each  child
in South Africa, Southern Africa and the world.

I would agree with those who made the point that the main emphasis  must  be
on prevention. There was a proposal made  here  by  Minister  Skweyiya  that
every member should try to register at least 300  children.  This  is  quite
critical because there are constant  stories  about  children  who  are  not
going to school. There is no reason why every single child should not be  at
school. No school - and I repeat, no school - or principal has the right  to
refuse to educate a child because that child's parents cannot afford to  pay
the fees. It is against the law. There is no school that can hold  back  the
giving of a school report because fees have not been paid. That  is  against
the law.

If we are public representatives, I think it is part of  our  responsibility
to go to those schools to ensure that those principals and school  governing
bodies that are abusing the law are themselves  disabused  of  what  we  do.
There is no reason why any child who is able to get to school should not  be
in school.
In conclusion, let me say that it is our responsibility  to  roll  back  the
frontiers of poverty. In rolling back the frontiers of poverty, we  can  and
we  must  be  in  the  position  to  create  the  kinds  of  conditions  and
circumstances in which all our children, wherever they are,  whatever  class
or racial grouping they come from, whether they  are  from  urban  or  rural
areas, have the possibility to live their lives  to  their  full  potential.
Let me once again thank the Chairperson and the  NCOP  for  enabling  us  to
participate in this debate. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 15:30.
