                            WELCOMING OF MEMBERS

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Hon  members,  let  me
take this opportunity to welcome you to our  first  sitting  of  this  year,
2003. I can see that everybody looks very fresh, healthy and ready  to  take
up the important work of 2003. I see our Ministers are also here, so we  are
ready for the big job. You are all most welcome. For  those  who  have  just
started today, I wish to extend an even warmer welcome to you. Some  of  you
started quite early in the year.

Over and above that, I also wish to officially welcome our Chairperson,  who
has been out of the country on the Hajj pilgrimage. She has returned  safely
to our country. You are welcome, Chairperson. She is not feeling  well.  Her
leg is a bit uncomfortable, so we are just nursing  her  so  that  she  gets
better. But we are very thankful. God has been with you on  your  long  trip
for Hajj and allowed  you  to  be  back  with  us  again.  Thanks  for  your
commitment, which keeps you here to be with us and  to  carry  on  with  the
job.

                NOTICES OF MOTION AND MOTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE

                               (Announcement)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, by virtue of an  agreement  with
all the political parties, there will be no notices  of  motion  or  motions
without notice today.

                      INTERNATIONAL MOTHER LANGUAGE DAY

                                (Statements)

Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, colleagues, hon members, tomorrow, 21  February,
marks International  Mother  Language  Day,  which  was  created  by  Unesco
following a proposal made by Bangladesh and launched at the 30th session  of
the general conference of Unesco in 1999.

A culture of peace can only flourish when people  enjoy  the  right  to  use
their own mother language fully and freely in all the various situations  of
their lives. International Mother Language Day aims at promoting  linguistic
diversity  and  multilingual  education  and   at   raising   awareness   of
linguistics and cultural traditions based on  understanding,  tolerance  and
dialogue.

Languages are at the very heart of Unesco's objective.  They  are  the  most
powerful  instruments  of  preserving  and  developing  our   tangible   and
intangible heritage. With the upsurge in the  means  of  communication,  our
own period seems to have created more situations  of  conflict  between  the
languages of the world than ever before, by the same token causing more  and
more languages to disappear at an accelerating pace.
Today about half of the 6 000 or so languages spoken in the world are  under
threat.  Over  the  past  three  centuries  languages  have  died  out   and
disappeared at a dramatic and steadily  increasing  pace.  At  least  3  000
tongues are endangered, seriously endangered or dying in many parts  of  the
world.

Unesco is conducting a study into  some  of  the  most  endangered  language
groups. This language initiative also fits into the organisation's  move  to
protect the intangible heritage  of  humanity,  which  includes  traditional
popular  music,  dance  festivals,  traditions,  craft  know-how   or   oral
traditions and local languages, because these traditions and  practices  are
at the heart of humanity's cultural diversity.

Unesco is proposing that the international community take steps  to  protect
these cultural treasures as it does tangible cultural and natural sites  and
monuments. This is evident in South Africa, where many aboriginal  languages
such as Khoi and San  were  nearly  extinct.  South  Africa  recognised  the
importance of languages in the initial phase of our democratic  rule.  Among
the Chapter 9 institutions  strengthening  constitutional  democracy,  whose
establishment  is  provided  for  in  section  181  of  the  South   African
Constitution, is the Commission for the  Promotion  and  Protection  of  the
Rights of Cultural, Religious and  Linguistic  Communities.  Our  Government
took the initiative seriously, and I can proudly say today that this  is  no
longer a paper guarantee. This commission  has  been  established  in  South
Africa by an Act of Parliament.

In conclusion, all moves to promote  the  dissemination  of  mother  tongues
will serve not only  to  encourage  linguistic  diversity  and  multilingual
education but also to assist  the  development  of  a  fuller  awareness  of
linguistic and cultural traditions  throughout  the  world  and  to  inspire
solidarity  based  on  understanding,  tolerance  and   dialogue.   The   SA
Government  also  recognises  the  great  importance  of  safeguarding   the
linguistic and cultural heritage of humanity and extending the influence  of
each of the cultures and languages of which that heritage is composed.

With these few words I would like to say that we shall honour the  day  when
it comes tomorrow. [Applause.]

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter,  dwarsoor  die  wêreld  stem  akademici  saam  dat
kinders ten beste  vorder  waar  hulle  in  hul  moedertaal  onderrig  word.
Moedertaal is ook onlosmaaklik verbonde aan die kultuurlewe van  elke  mens.
Die  Suid-Afrikaanse  reënboognasie,  waarin  elkeen  sy  taal,  kultuur  en
godsdiens  kan  uitlewe,  is  een  van  die  oorheersende  ideale  wat   die
grondleggers van die Grondwet vir die nuwe Suid-Afrika beoog het.

Die DA sê: Laat ons moedertaalonderwys bevorder en so Suid-Afrika  dien.  Ek
dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.]

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, across the world academics agree  that  children
make the best progress when tutored  in  their  mother  tongue.  The  mother
tongue is also inextricably linked to the cultural  life  of  every  person.
The South African rainbow nation, in which everyone can give  expression  to
their own language, culture and religion, is one of the paramount ideals  as
envisaged by the architects of the Constitution of the new South Africa.

The DA says: Let us promote mother tongue education and in  so  doing  serve
South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo  ohloniphekileyo,   kusasa   wusuku   olukhulu
nolungumlando emhlabeni wonke nasezweni lonke e-Afrika - ukudunyiswa  kolimi
lomdabu okuwulimi umuntu aluncela ebeleni likamama mhla efika  kulo  mhlaba.
Kuyinto ebaluleke kakhulu leyo.

Kafushane  nje  olwethu  olimi   selucindezelwe   kakhulu   lwaze   lwavuma.
Siyojabula  ukubona  uguquko  olukhomba  ngempela   ukuthi   ulimi   lomdabu
siyalugqamisa. Akugqame phela  emsakazweni  yonke,  ikakhulu  kumabonwakude.
Umuntu  ube  esavule  shaneli   athole   kukwitiza,   sikunqenani   okwethu.
Umabonwakude mawukhombise ukuthi siyi-Afrika, sise-Afrika hhayi  ukuthi  ube
usavule shaneli kugqame isilungu,  yingakho  nabantwana  bethu  sebelubukela
phansi ulimi lomdabu.

Yini singabukeli kwezinye  izizwe?  Sifuna  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe  wezeMfundo
abhukulele ukuthi ulimi lomdabu  lufundiswe  ezikoleni.  Kanti  kuyoze  kube
nini na? Siyazizwa izithembiso kodwa asikuboni ukufezeka kwazo.

Thina beNkatha  Freedom  Party  siyawathanda  futhi  siyawahlonipha  amasiko
ethu.  Isizwe  esingenamasiko  akusizwe  salutho  leso.  Sithi-ke   phambili
ngolimi lomdabu, phambili  ma-Afrika!  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, tomorrow is a great historic day  in  Africa
and the world over. It is a day on  which  mother  language  is  celebrated,
language that one took with the milk from the breast of  one's  mother  when
one was born. That is a very important thing.

In short, our African languages have been oppressed for so  long  that  they
have remained just that: oppressed languages. We will be happy to  see  some
changes which show that we are developing our languages. They must shine  on
radio and especially on television. Every time one tunes in  to  a  channel,
one hears a foreign language. Why are we so shy  about  our  languages?  The
television must show that we are Africans. It  should  not  be  a  situation
where every time one goes to a channel one hears English. That  is  why  our
children are now looking down on our African languages. Why do we not  learn
a lesson from other countries? We want the Minister of  Education  to  fight
for the use of African languages  in  schools.  In  fact,  when  will  these
languages be used? We only hear the promises, but we do not see  them  being
fulfilled.
We in the IFP love and respect our cultures. A nation without cultures is  a
dead nation.  Therefore,  we  say:  "Forward  with  the  use  of  indigenous
languages, forward you Africans!" [Applause.]]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie. Ek is baie bly dat ons  vandag
weer Internasionale Moedertaaldag vier. Dit  is  hierdie  Huis  wat  daarmee
begin het laasjaar en wat  dit  ook  in  die  provinsies  en  die  Nasionale
Vergadering aan die gang gesit het. Ek is egter  teleurgesteld  dat  hierdie
debat op grond van partygrondslag en -affiliasie plaasvind en nie  op  grond
van taalaffiliasie, maar ons verstaan die omstandighede.

Voorsitter, wat baie belangrik is,  is  dat  ons  moet  oppas  dat  dit  wat
kollega Kgware kwytgeraak het, naamlik dat 3 000 van die  6  000  tale  gaan
uitsterf, dat dit nie 3 001 tale gaan word en Tswana daarby  ingesluit  word
nie, omdat hy hier gestaan en Engels praat het. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Wat  baie
belangrik is, is dat die agb lid hier langsaan haar mond moet  hou  en  saam
met ons feesvier, as sy kan.

Hierdie Huis het die klimaat geskep vir veeltaligheid  in  Suid-Afrika.  Dit
is uit hierdie Huis se voorganger wat Pansat die lewe gesien het.  Dis  hier
waar daar veeltaligheidsdebatte gevoer is. Dit is hier  waar  mosies  gestel
is, waar daar drie privaatlede se wetgewende voorstelle ingedien is en  waar
ons ook nou besig is  om  heroorweging  te  skenk  aan  'n  konferensie  oor
veeltaligheid vir parlementslede.

Die gesindheid van die Voorsitter en  die  Ondervoorsitter  en  van  hierdie
lede is juis so om veeltaligheid en ons moedertale te bevorder. Dan  op  die
vooraand van Moedertaaldag het daar 'n wonderlike ding  gebeur.  Vir  etlike
jare is ons besig om met dringendheid te agiteer dat daar 'n Taalwet  en  'n
taalbeleid vir Suid-Afrika goedgekeur moet word. Gister het die  Kabinet  'n
taalplan en 'n taalbeleid vir Suid-Afrika goedgekeur wat die basis vorm  vir
wetgewing wat hierdie jaar deurgevoer moet  word.  Ons  kan  daarvoor  hande
klap want dit is die begin van moedertaalvestiging in Suid-Afrika.

Nou moet hierdie Huis - die uitvoerende gesag het hulle  deel  gedoen  -  sy
deel doen. Die Parlement moet dit so vinnig moontlik deur die proses kry  en
dit is 'n wet wat in die  NRP  ter  Tafel  gelê  moet  word,  waar  ons  sal
aandring op wye konsultasie. Dit moet gevat word na die mense  toe.  Hierdie
wet moet ons mense bymekaar bring en nie deur  hierdie  sensitiwiteit  mense
uitmekaar  dryf  nie.  Dit  is  ook  die  basis  vir  die  sukses  van   die
Afrikaparlement waarna ons streef. Ons moet dit hier  maak  werk,  want  die
Pan-Afrikaanse  Parlement  sal  nie  werk  as  ons  nie  die   kwessie   van
veeltaligheid en moedertaal in Afrika ook aanspreek nie.

Ek is trots om vandag in my moedertaal hier te staan en praat, want dis  die
mooiste taal in die wêreld. Ek voel so en ek  hoop  dat  al  die  lede  hier
presies dieselfde voel oor hul  moedertaal.  Ek  sluit  af  deur  te  sê:!ke
e:/xarra//ke. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, thank you very much. I am very  glad  that
today we are once again celebrating International Mother  Language  Day.  It
is this House which began with this last year, and which also got  it  going
in the provinces and the National Assembly. However, I am disappointed  that
this  debate  is  taking  place  on  the  basis  of  party  principles   and
affiliation, and  not  on  the  basis  of  linguistic  affiliation,  but  we
understand the circumstances.

Chairperson, what is very  important  is  that  we  must  beware  that  what
colleague Kgware referred to, namely that 3 000 of the 6 000 languages  will
die out, does not become  3  001  languages  in  which  Tswana  is  included
because he stood here and  spoke  English.  [Interjections.]  What  is  very
important is that the hon member next door should keep quiet  and  celebrate
with us, if she can.

This House created the climate for multilingualism in South Africa.  PanSALB
came to life because of this House's predecessor. It is  here  that  debates
on multilingualism were held. It is here where motions are put, where  three
private members' legislative proposals were submitted and where we are  also
now busy reconsidering  a  conference  on  multilingualism  for  members  of
Parliament.

The attitude of the Chairperson and the  Deputy  Chairperson  and  of  these
members is precisely to promote multilingualism and  our  mother  languages.
Then, on the eve of International Mother  Language  Day  a  wonderful  thing
happened. For numerous years we have been urgently agitating for a  language
Act and a language policy to be approved for  South  Africa.  Yesterday  the
Cabinet approved a language plan and a  language  policy  for  South  Africa
which forms the basis for legislation which must be  passed  this  year.  We
can applaud that because it is the beginning of the establishment of  mother
languages in South Africa.

Now this House - the executive authority has done its part  -  must  do  its
part. Parliament must get it through the process as quickly as possible  and
it is an Act which must be tabled in the  NCOP,  where  we  will  insist  on
broad consultation. It must be taken to the people. This Act must bring  our
people together and not force people apart because of this  sensitivity.  It
is also the basis for the success of the African  Parliament  for  which  we
are striving. We must make it work here, because the Pan African  Parliament
will not work if we do not also address the  issue  of  multilingualism  and
mother languages in Africa.

I am proud to stand here today and speak my mother language, because  it  is
the most beautiful language in the world. That is how  I  feel  and  I  hope
that all the members here feel precisely the same  way  about  their  mother
language. I which  to  conclude  by  saying:  !ke  e:/xarra//ke.  [Unity  in
diversity.] [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 15:22.

                          TUESDAY, 4 FEBRUARY 2003

ANNOUNCEMENTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker and the Chairperson report to their respective Houses:


     A serious allegation was made against the  Presiding  Officers  at  the
     meeting of the Joint Rules Committee on Tuesday, 4  February  2003.  In
     terms of Joint Rule  30,  as  this  allegation  was  made  against  the
     Presiding Officers, it is being reported directly to the House for  its
     attention.


     The unrevised transcript of the relevant proceedings is as follows:


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Thank you. I want to address just  one  issue  and
         that is the so-called "critical issue" raised  by  Minister  Manuel
         in b). We all know that it was not Minister Manuel who  raised  the
         point. We know that the Presiding Officers hold that view, which  I
         think is rather - factually and legally ...


         The SPEAKER: Sorry, could you speak into the microphone?


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Sorry?


         The SPEAKER: Could you speak into the microphone. You do  not  need
         to look at us.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Must I start again?


         As I said, I am addressing the second  so-called  "critical  issue"
         that Minister Manuel raises, and which  we  know  is  not  Minister
         Manuel's issue. It is the issue of the Presiding Officers,  because
         that is the view they hold ...


         The SPEAKER: I am sorry. Could you explain that?


         Mr J H DE LANGE: We know that the two of you,  Presiding  Officers,
         hold this view and we know how you feel on these matters.  Clearly,
         you raised it with Minister Manuel and now it is  given  to  us  in
         the form of them wanting to raise it with us.


         I do not think we should beat about the  bush.  We  all  know  that
         this is the point of view you hold.  Of  course,  the  rest  of  us
         disagree  totally  with  that  and  that  is  why  the  rules   are
         different, as Mrs Seaton has spoken.


         I want to make the point here that,  factually  and  legally,  this
         position is wrong. Firstly, not the Joint Rules  Committee  or  any
         committee  in  Parliament  makes  decisions.  You  yourself,  Madam
         Speaker, remind us of that all the time.  You  remind  us  that  no
         committee, and that includes the Joint  Rules  Committee,  has  any
         power in terms of the Constitution to make decisions. We  know  how
         it works. This Rules Committee decides on matters  and  then  there
         is a clause in the ATC which says that this is a  report  from  the
         Rules Committee. The House adopts it and  if  the  House  does  not
         raise any issue, it is the position of the House, not of the  Rules
         Committee or of any committee of Parliament.  So  it  is  factually
         incorrect to say that.
         Secondly, factually the legal position is also incorrectly  stated.
         All that has happened through the Rules Committee -  we  have  said
         this many times, but clearly there is a difference  of  opinion  on
         this - is that  we  have  created  a  process  whereby  members  of
         Parliament can participate in a process of  having  a  say  in  the
         running of their own Parliament. That is all we have  done.  At  no
         stage  do   we   make   decisions   as   subcommittees.   We   make
         recommendations to the Rules Committee. At no stage does the  Rules
         Committee  make  decisions.  It  is  Parliament  that  makes  these
         decisions.


         Secondly, the Rules do not change the position in  the  Powers  and
         Privileges of  Parliament  Act.  Legally  that  is  the  situation.
         Legally - and Madam Speaker and the Chairperson know  this  -  that
         Act stands and it  makes  the  Secretary  the  accounting  officer,
         subject to being  overruled  by  the  Presiding  Officers,  and  in
         particular ... In the Act the word is "the  Speaker".  Legally  the
         situation is that ultimately the  accounting  officer  remains  the
         Secretary,  with  the  Presiding  Officers  having  the  overruling
         power.
         The processes that we participate in through  the  Rules  Committee
         and the subcommittees is, of course,  that  we  in  Parliament  say
         what we want, but ultimately  the  Speaker  and  the  Secretary  to
         Parliament put forward the budget. It is very  clear  legally  that
         that is the situation. Of course, you can ignore what we  tell  you
         in the Rules Committee. You can ignore that,  because  legally  you
         have the power to be the accounting officer in the  manner  that  I
         have spelt out.


         I think, firstly, that we can have differences of opinion. That  is
         no problem. But let us at least take the thing  factually.  I  know
         this type  of  thing.  You  keep  raising  it  as,  "Well,  now,  a
         committee is not an executive authority". It is  done,  of  course,
         to be quite emotional about the thing and  say,  "Well,  how  is  a
         committee an executive authority?" A  committee  can  never  be  an
         executive authority, and we know  that.  Legally  it  is  not  like
         that, until the Powers and Privileges of Parliament Act changes.


         But what we have done, through  changing  the  Rules,  is  that  it
         cannot be that the Speaker herself just decides what  the  policies
         of Parliament are.  We  have  created  a  process  whereby  we  can
         participate,  but  of  course  the  Presiding  Officers  ultimately
         decide how to do that. Of course, if they want to  ignore  it  they
         can, but there are things that can happen then. So, really, let  us
         have this difference of opinion if we want to, but let us not  deal
         with it in this way.


         This is really unfortunate ... to raise it with  the  Minister  and
         then the Minister telling us to fix it up. It is just  not  ...  It
         is actually just ... Well, let me rather not  say  it.  I  want  to
         make the point that the two of you have that position, and that  is
         fine. The rest of us disagree.


         The SPEAKER: Mr de Lange, before I give the floor to  anyone  else,
         you have alleged that  this  was  raised  with  Mr  Manuel  by  the
         Presiding Officers. You will either substantiate that  or  withdraw
         it. You are entitled to your opinion. I do not have a problem  with
         that. But to make an allegation like that in  this  committee,  you
         will have to withdraw or substantiate it.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Well, I will speak to Mr Manuel  and  I  will  see
         what he ...


         The SPEAKER: No! You will do it here.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: No, I will not do it now, because I have to  speak
         to Mr Manuel. I am not going to withdraw anything  that  I  do  not
         have proof of.


         The SPEAKER: This meeting is adjourned. I will not preside  over  a
         meeting in which that kind of allegation is made.


         Mr J H DE LANGE: Well, fine!

     The Joint Rules Committee at the request of parties met on Wednesday, 5
     February 2003, after it was adjourned before concluding its business on
     4 February when the hon Adv J H de Lange  made  an  allegation  in  the
     Committee against the  Presiding  Officers  which  he  did  not  either
     substantiate or withdraw when called upon to do so.


     The Speaker and the Chairperson of the National Council  of  Provinces,
     as Co-Chairpersons, took the chair whereupon the Speaker requested  the
     Committee to elect chairpersons  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  the
     meeting. Mr G Q M Doidge and Ms S  N  Ntlabati  were  duly  elected  as
     Acting Co-Chairpersons.


     The hon Adv De Lange was then given an opportunity to make a statement,
     and did so in the following terms:


         Mr J H DE LANGE: I would like to make a statement dealing with  the
         retraction of those remarks  made  by  me  at  that  joint  meeting
         yesterday, 4 February. I would like to say  that  I  regret  having
         made  those  remarks  and  I  withdraw  them   unconditionally.   I
         obviously apologise to this Committee for any inconvenience that  I
         may have caused in the process.


     The Committee accepted the statement and agreed that it be published in
     the next Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports.


     In response to an invitation by the Chair to comment on the  statement,
     the Speaker indicated that she would be reporting on the matter to  the
     National Assembly and  the  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
     Provinces noted that the apology was not also specifically directed  at
     the affected members.


     The Committee resolved that the issue had been disposed of.
