                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Before  we  continue  with  the  next
Order of the Day, I wish to make the following ruling.
On 8 April during the debate on the Sport and Recreation  Budget  Vote,  the
hon Mr W J Seremane raised a point of order about  a  remark  the  hon  I  Z
Ncinane made with reference to the hon T D Lee. I  undertook  to  study  the
Hansard and give a ruling. Having now  had  the  opportunity  to  study  the
unrevised Hansard, I wish to rule as follows.

Hon Mr Ncinane, with reference to the hon Mr  Lee  who  had  just  left  the
podium, said - and this is translated from the original Xhosa  text  -  that
"He perseveres in being  a  zombie".  The  remark  cast  aspersions  on  the
integrity of the hon Mr Lee, and I therefore  ask  the  hon  Mr  Ncinane  to
withdraw the remark.

Mnu I Z NCINANE: Sihlalo nani malungu, nangona ndayithetha  into  yokuba  le
ndoda ifana nesithunzela ... [Kwahlekwa.] ... kwaye nangona ndandiba  yinene
emsulwa leyo, kodwa ngenxa yokuba wena Sihlalo weeKomiti  usithi  akulungile
ukuthetha eso sipororo gqi apha  kule  Ndlu  yoWiso-mthetho,  ndiyawarhoxisa
loo mazwi. Enkosi. [Chairman and hon members, although I did say  that  this
man is like a zombie ... [Laughter.] ... and although I believed that to  be
the truth, because you, Chairperson of Committees, say  that  such  language
is unparliamentary, I withdraw those words. Thank you.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Eli lungu liwarhoxisile loo mazwi.  That  is,
the member has withdrawn the remark.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Ms R TALJAARD: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that the House -


  (1) notes that -


        (a)      Dr Richard Young's litigation has revealed that the Report
               of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) on the arms  deal  was
               extensively edited in the consultation process  between  the
               Auditor-General and the Executive;


        (b)      the editing has compromised the Auditor-General;


        (c)      senior defence officials and former Chief of Acquisitions,
               `Chippy' Shaik, misled  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public
               Accounts (Scopa) in a public  hearing  in  October  2000  on
               conflicts of interest in respect of the arms deal;


        (d)      the sections of the draft report  that  dealt  with  these
               inaccuracies in the presentation to Scopa were  subsequently
               omitted from the final report;


        (e)      the  Auditor-General  has  stated  on  numerous  occasions
               before the House that the JIT Report was merely  altered  in
               style and textual changes and that the interactions with the
               Executive had not resulted in substantive alteration;
        (f)      it has been misled to believe that no substantive  changes
               were made to the JIT Report; and


  (2) calls on -


        (a)       the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to   release   the
               comprehensive drafts of the JIT Report  immediately  and  to
               reveal the extent to which the House has been misled; and


        (b)      the Speaker to grant an immediate debate on this issue and
               take the strongest possible action against any  official  or
               public office bearer who has misled the House.

Hon MEMBER: Hear, hear! [Applause.]

        EXCHANGE CONTROL AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL
                                      (
                            First Reading debate)

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Chairperson, before starting my address on  this  Bill,  the
Minister has requested that I bring to  the  attention  of  the  House  some
unintended textual errors for correction. In line 33 on page  9,  in  clause
10 the word "or" at the end of the sentence should read "and". In  line  34,
which is the next line, the phrase "has failed to confirm" should read  "has
confirmed". These changes should  therefore  be  effected  to  the  Bill  as
introduced.

The ANC supports the Exchange Control  Amnesty  and  Amendment  of  Taxation
Laws Bill before  us.  This  Bill  speaks  about  and  appeals  to  honesty,
forgiveness, fairness and patriotism so that we can build a country for  all
who live in it.

I quote from  the  President's  speech  on  the  report  of  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission:


  "Together we must confront the challenges of steering through  a  complex
  transition that  demands  that  we  manage  the  historical  fault-lines,
  without papering over the cracks, moved by a new and  common  patriotism.
  Patriotism, through nation-building, asks of us,  the  people,  to  give,
  invest and sacrifice. Some have in the past, but we currently still  have
  the mindset of people who do not put in but rather ask what they can  get
  out of the country.

This Bill grants amnesty to certain  individuals.  If  amnesty  is  granted,
then a sinful act or crime must have been committed. Amnesty  means  that  a
general pardon is granted owing to a crime or crimes committed  against  the
Government. The crime that  is  addressed  in  this  Bill  refers  to  those
individuals who moved their assets offshore illegally, either by  themselves
or owing to  advice  and  assistance  from  advisers  or  facilitators,  tax
advisers, financial advisers or attorneys.

The confession room is open. A period of grace  to  confess  your  sins  has
been granted as from 1 June to 30 November 2003. Now,  unlike  in  religion,
this will not be a case of whoever confesses their sins  will  be  forgiven.
Only South African residents,  natural  persons,  including  those  who  are
deceased and who have passed their  inheritance  on  to  another  person  or
individual  or  individuals,  will  have  their  sins  forgiven.  A   closed
corporation or trust may also apply for amnesty.

An amnesty unit will be set up to oversee  this  process.  Members  of  this
unit are subject to the same secrecy provisions as members of  Sars  dealing
with income tax returns. The application  process  is  designed  to  provide
maximum privacy for an applicant so as to ensure that secrecy is  maintained
throughout the approval process.

Those who qualify for amnesty will not be obliged to disclose the  names  of
the advisers or facilitators who assisted them. But if they mistakenly  name
them, then the Receiver of Revenue or the SA Reserve Bank  cannot  use  this
information to prosecute the advisers or facilitators.

The applicant will have to disclose the origins of the funds that are  being
disclosed. Facilitators will, however, be allowed to apply for  amnesty  for
the role they played in shifting the funds. No amnesty  will  be  considered
for individuals or entities that are engaged in criminal activities such  as
drug peddling,  smuggling,  money-laundering  and/or  terrorist  activities.
Those who are already  under  investigation  by  the  authorities  regarding
their foreign assets will not  qualify  for  amnesty  through  this  amnesty
process.

In a news article it was  stated  that  some  advisers  are  advising  their
clients not to apply for amnesty as it may set  off  an  investigation  into
their matters.  These  advisers  must  remember  that  under  the  Financial
Intelligence  Centre  Act,  it  is  required   that   they   disclose   this
information.

Disclosure of these funds will be charged with a levy of 5%  on  assets  set
for repatriation and 10% against  assets  that  will  continue  to  be  held
offshore, less the unused R750 000 allowance.  These  levies  must  be  paid
from the foreign assets' proceeds within three months. A levy of 2% will  be
charged if there was a failure to disclose any income  from  foreign  assets
that were converted into domestic income. This is extremely lenient.

The exchange control aspects  of  the  amnesty  apply  to  the  extent  that
foreign assets are disclosed - on an asset-by-asset basis. Each  asset  must
be applied for. Those assets that are not disclosed will  still  be  subject
to potential civil and criminal exchange control prosecution.

An applicant's disclosure of foreign assets requires  a  statement  of  that
asset's market  value  as  at  28  February  2003,  with  the  market  value
determined in the foreign currency of the country in  which  that  asset  is
situated, as well as a description of the nature of that  asset.  Applicants
and facilitators seeking amnesty must submit an  application  by  way  of  a
sworn affidavit or solemn declaration.

We ask ourselves how it was possible for funds to leave this country.  Money
was transported through our  smaller  airports  where  security  is  not  so
sophisticated; money transfers  were  made;  bogus  companies  were  set  up
offshore and transactions by underinvoicing or overinvoicing  for  purchases
were done. These are but a few of the creative schemes that were used.

The DP abstained from voting on  this  Bill  in  the  committee  because  of
trivial reasons such as: the  Bill  is  imperfectly  crafted;  it  will  not
achieve Government's stated objectives, that is,  to  secure  more  revenue;
and that the amnesty is not wide enough. As usual, doom and gloom.  We  want
to say to the DA: Crime is crime. No  exception  must  be  given  to  white-
collar crime, which is sometimes seen as not being so severe.

Be a true South African or a true African. Bring  your  money  back  and  be
part of building a better life for all. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Deputy Chair, colleagues, as a legislator  one  is  not  very
often confronted with the dilemma that confronted  us  in  considering  this
Bill before the House today. The  DA  supports  the  Minister  of  Finance's
announcement in the  Budget  Speech  of  this  amnesty.  We  support  it  in
principle,  knowing  full  well  that  amnesties  are  always  and  in   all
circumstances a gracious pardoning, never ever a condonation, of ill  deeds.
We also support the three policy  objectives  that  the  Bill  espouses:  to
enable violators to regularise their affairs; to ensure  maximum  disclosure
of foreign assets and to facilitate repatriation  thereof;  and  to  broaden
the tax base.

We furthermore support the related policy spin-offs of this process,  easing
the road to further exchange control liberalisation  and  the  harmonisation
of our efforts with international efforts to target tax  havens  and  money-
laundering. For all these initiatives, Minister, you do  have  our  support.
However, we believe that the system that has been designed  to  give  effect
to the amnesty process itself is problematic. We do  not  believe  that  the
policy objectives ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Please continue.

Ms R TALJAARD: ... stated in the explanatory memorandum will be realised  by
the imperfect instrument we vote on today. This is regrettable, as we  would
have wanted to see  a  tremendously  successful  tax  and  exchange  control
amnesty process. For any successful amnesty  two  ingredients  are  crucial:
equity and certainty. Certainty and equity, which a  general  amnesty  would
have facilitated, are crucial to confidence in the process.  And  confidence
in the process, in turn, is crucial to a success.

In terms of equity considerations, a  constitutional  question  arises.  The
Bill discriminates among those  taxpayers  who  will  be  eligible  for  the
amnesty. Individuals, close corporations and  trusts  can  apply,  companies
can't. Facilitators will be eligible, but advisers won't. And  so  with  the
discrimination among categories of eligible applicants the  concerns  arise.
As Sars pointed out, the question of discrimination is  one  of  rationality
with reference to stated policy objectives. Without having had sight of  any
of the formal legal opinions sourced within either Treasury or  the  Reserve
Bank, the DA has its doubts as to whether the chosen categories  would  meet
the rationality test and pass constitutional muster.

We do not believe that, apart from  constitutional  concerns,  some  of  the
distinctions will be workable. For example, many advisers  and  facilitators
would have multitasked and worn both hats.  It  may  even  be  difficult  to
separate these roles. How does the Bill aim to solve this quandary? The  new
section 3(1)(c) refers to facilitators  as  those  who  "...  assisted  that
applicant (otherwise than solely in an  advisory  capacity)".  Not  only  is
this clumsy legal language, but it would furthermore be  very  difficult  to
make a distinction based on this wording and claim that  parties  have  been
treated fairly and equitably.

In addition, the exclusion of companies from the ambit of the  amnesty  will
reduce its scope considerably and minimise the numbers of  those  that  will
be able to regularise their affairs and be brought into the tax  base.  This
policy decision has clearly been made due to  the  need  to  facilitate  the
continuation of  the  exchange  control  regime  in  a  process  of  gradual
liberalisation.  As  the  Reserve  Bank  indeed  told  the  committee,   any
extension of  the  tax  and  foreign  exchange  control  amnesty  regime  to
companies would render foreign exchange controls ineffective.

It is exactly, however, because this amnesty process  should  play  a  large
part in giving us a full and clear  picture  of  the  South  African  assets
offshore  en  route  to  full  currency  convertibility  that  the   company
exclusion is regrettable. By  excluding  companies  one  can  predict,  with
relative certainty, that the picture of what  is  out  there  offshore  will
almost certainly be incomplete. Despite reassurances, we  believe  that  the
constitutional validity of the exclusion of companies from the ambit of  the
amnesty remains challengeable, and time  will  tell  whether  any  corporate
entity will take up the cudgels of such a challenge as the  amnesty  process
unfolds. [Interjections.] That will be  the  test.  Indeed,  Minister,  that
will be the test.

For the amnesty to work, the certainty ingredient must mean that  those  who
come clean are confronted with a tax TLC, unfair as this may  seem  to  law-
abiding taxpayers,  and  not  with  a  retributive  tax  TRC.  There  is  an
important difference.

In this regard, certainty about the powers and functions and  procedures  to
be applied by the special amnesty unit will be crucial. While much has  been
done to take away fears on the degree of discretion to  be  applied  by  the
unit in the decision-making process and  specific  secrecy  provisions  that
will apply, we do not believe it to be desirable to leave the  bulk  of  the
legislation that deals with the unit to  be  dealt  with  through  delegated
legislation. It merely serves to increase the uncertainty  at  a  time  when
one wishes to maximise certainty.

This is obviously most important in respect to information, which  has  been
addressed fairly comprehensively in the Bill, we concede,  but  also  has  a
strong,  just  administrative  action  component  that  becomes   far   more
difficult when officials act under delegated legislation.

In  other  jurisdictions  that  have  applied  an  amnesty  the  records  of
unsuccessful  applicants  were  subsequently  destroyed.   On   Monday   the
committee was told that the National Treasury  would  retain  all  documents
purely to facilitate appeal procedures, both  internally  and  to  the  High
Court. While there are new prohibitions on the destruction of records  under
the Promotion of  Access  to  Information  Act,  the  DA  believes  that  an
amendment could have  been  included  in  this  section,  stating  that  the
National Treasury, apart from being bound by secrecy  provisions,  may  only
retain documents to facilitate appeals. This would have  obviously  added  a
modicum of legal certainty as to the  purpose  for  which  the  records  are
being retained.

While we agree categorically  with  the  principles  and  policy  objectives
which the amnesty announcement in the Budget aimed to  achieve,  we  do  not
believe that this Bill before the House will achieve its goals.  We  believe
that it is an imperfect instrument. We will not oppose it, Minister,  as  we
agree with its goals and underpinning reasoning, but we  cannot,  given  its
imperfections, support it much as we would have wished to. The  DA  abstains
from this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, the IFP supports this amnesty and the  Bill  that
introduces it. After  all,  it  was  the  IFP  in  1998  which,  through  my
colleague Hennie  Bekker,  proposed  just  such  an  amnesty.  I  think  the
Minister has been wise in waiting  for  a  few  years.  The  environment  is
obviously more probable now for such an amnesty, I think, in  terms  of  the
points he has raised before - that the investment climate  and  the  returns
in this country would make it more conducive to bring money  back  into  the
country, as the new  exchange  control  regime  is  far  more  friendly  and
facilitative for such an amnesty.

Amnesties,  especially  those  that  relate  to  tax  matters,  are   always
extremely difficult. It is about having to make law; to make the  particular
legal actions of a particular category of people free of consequences.  This
invariably brings  numerous  complex  competing  considerations  into  play.
There  are  trade-offs,  balances  and  judgment  calls  which  have  to  be
established and then built  into  the  law,  which  must  be  clear  on  the
processes and other practicalities necessary  to facilitate the amnesty.

It is all an exercise of working to a bigger goal and to a  bigger  picture,
and will always be an exercise that might not get it all right.  After  all,
its success will be based on how many people at the end of the day  actually
apply for the amnesty in the window period. We can never be  sure  that  the
conditions of the amnesty will achieve what is necessary to coax the  target
group to come forward, or that the conditions,  on  the  other  hand,  might
discourage them. We know of the recent Italian  experience  where  they  did
not get it right and the  amnesty  was  considered  to  be  something  of  a
failure.

Our appreciation of this Bill is that  its  drafters  really  applied  their
minds, and I think they also applied their imagination.  It  is  imagination
that is required here, because one is working with the unknown. One  is  not
quite sure of the psychology of the would-be applicants  as  to  what  would
coax them to come forward, and, on the other hand, what would deter them.

Have we got it right? We don't know. Of course  there  will  be  those  that
will be wise before the event and some that will be wise  after  the  event.
But only once the window period ends will we know  whether  we  did  get  it
right.

I think what could deter applicants is if they feel the  penalties  are  too
high, or if they feel that the confidentiality of their applications is  not
sufficiently tight. However, against this I think we do have to look at  the
positives, the desirables, the overall goals. The one goal  is  the  benefit
of the tax base broadening, the  equity  it  brings  into  the  system,  the
foreign inflows, the modest additional revenues and the fact that  it  also,
in its own way, discourages money-laundering.

The IFP would encourage everyone who  this  amnesty  speaks  to,  to  apply,
because it is the right thing to do, and I think we would go along with  the
hon Joemat here and also say because it is the  patriotic  thing  to  do.  A
little warning is that  we  all  know  how  Sars  is  becoming  increasingly
proficient at finding people with bad tax records,  and  we  know  they  are
gradually working their way into foreign transactions.

Also, with the strength of the double taxation  agreements  that  have  come
forward  and  the  communication  channels  that  are  opening  up   between
governments - even those in the so-called tax havens  -  those  people  that
don't come forward who should come forward might only get away with  it  for
a year. This might take five years, it might take 10  years,  but  somewhere
down the road, when it does catch them, it will be devastating.

This Bill is not only about the tax amnesty. There are other tax  amendments
to the tax laws, most of which the Minister announced in his  Budget  Speech
earlier this year. One of the surprise inclusions was the reduction  of  tax
on retirement funds from 25%  to  18%.  As  the  majority  of  pension  fund
members, believe it or not, are from the low income group, I think  that  it
was inappropriate before that they had to pay such  a  high  rate  on  their
savings, as opposed to the 18% they were paying in normal income  tax.  This
will provide some sort of interim relief ahead of the comprehensive  review,
which we know has already begun and we believe will be concluded next year.

Another issue in the Bill is the increase in the turnover threshold for  the
lower rate of tax allowed for small businesses. This, of course, makes  good
sense and will help to stimulate expansion of the small business sector.  We
hope that the Minister will soon add to this, perhaps in  consultation  with
the Minister of Trade and Industry, by  proposing  amendments  to  ease  the
complexity and, therefore, the cost of tax compliance for small businesses.

Other Budget Speech proposals, which we see are not in this Bill  but  which
we hope to expect in a further tax amendment Bill towards  the  end  of  the
year, would include the Minister's promise  of  further  extensions  to  the
list  of  public  benefit  organisations   qualifying   for   tax-deductible
donations, and also the accelerated depreciation allowances  for  investment
in underdeveloped designated urban areas. We see  a  number  of  interesting
comment and opinions expressed on these issues, many of which I am sure  the
Minister  will  take  note  of  and,  where  worthy,  will  include  in  the
legislation that he produces.

To conclude, an issue that we also asked  the  Minister  to  visit  at  some
stage is the introduction of a group basis of taxation for companies ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Continue, hon member.

Dr  G  G  WOODS:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  I  think   multinationals,   in
particular, would wish for such a basis, and  we  do  note  that  this  does
exist  with  favourable  circumstances  and  consequences  in   most   other
countries, particularly our trading partners. Thank you.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb Voorsitter, laat my toe om by hierdie  geleentheid  die
agb Minister en sy departement geluk te wens met die wyse waarop hulle Suid-
Afrika se finansies bestuur. Suid-Afrika is dié ontwikkelende  land  in  die
wêreld met die beste prestasiesyfer. Ons hou vol met 'n  3%,  of  amper  3%,
groeikoers nou al vir 'n geruime tyd, en daar is  geen  ander  ontwikkelende
land  wat  met  ons  kan  kers  vashou  nie.  Inteendeel,   baie   van   die
ontwikkelende lande in die wêreld is veel swakker daaraan toe,  en  die  agb
Trevor Manuel moet persoonlik daarvoor krediet kry  en  ons  wens  hom  baie
sterkte toe.

Natuurlik is daar ruimte vir verbetering en ek hoop ons sal in  die  toekoms
ook hier aangename debatte kan  hê  oor  sake  waaroor  ons  dink  daar  kan
verbetering wees, én in belang van Suid-Afrika sal ons dit graag  wil  doen.
Nie so negatief as wat die "His  Master's  Voice"  of  "big  business"  hier
tussen die pienk progs aan  my  linkerkant  dit  wil  doen  deur  nou  buite
stemming te bly nie. Dit is tipies van hulle om hul speelgoed  uit  die  kot
te gooi as hulle nie hul sin kry nie. Hulle praat namens "big  business"  en
groot maatskappye. Meneer, dis 'n patriot wat nie omgee  vir  die  armes  in
dié land nie - nie 'n flenter vir hulle  omgee  nie.  Dis  die  rede  waarom
hulle so te kere gaan vandag. En daar het  ons  weer  'n  tipiese  voorbeeld
vandag.

Hierdie wetgewing om amnestie vir geld wat onwettig uit die  land  uitgeneem
is - let wel onwettig, want dit is wettig om R750 000 uit te neem - dink  ek
is 'n goeie wet. Dit sal beleggersvertroue verbeter,  ek  glo  so.  Dit  sal
groter sekerheid en groter voorspelbaarheid bring, veral  by  beleggers.  Ek
is  persoonlik  spyt,  geagte  Minister,  dat  slegs   natuurlike   persone,
individue, geslote korporasies,  trusts,  en  ook  testamente  -  afgestorwe
testamente - sal kwalifiseer. Vir my is dit nie  heeltemal  aanvaarbaar  dat
maatskappye uitgesluit word nie, bloot "because they operate under a  wholly
separate, discretionary regime".

Ek sal graag van die Minister  in  'n  verdere  verduideliking  wil  verneem
waarom maatskappye uitgesluit word van hierdie amnestie. Dit sal  baie  meer
geld in die land kon inbring, dink  ek,  as  ons  dit  ook  kon  uitbrei  na
hierdie instansies toe, en ek sal graag van die Minister wil verneem of  dit
nie vir ons in die toekoms moontlik sal wees om ook hierdie  toegewings  aan
sy gaste te kan maak  nie.  Ons  het  ook  daardie  ekstra  geld  nodig  vir
beleggers in  Suid-Afrika  om  beleggings  te  maak,  sodat  werkgeleenthede
geskep kan word, én ons met sukses die armoedevraagstuk in  Suid-Afrika  kan
aanspreek.  Die  Nuwe  NP   sal   dié   wetgewing   ondersteun.   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr  W  A  ODENDAAL:  Hon  Chairperson,  allow  me  on  this   occasion   to
congratulate the hon Minister and his department  on  the  manner  in  which
they manage South Africa's finances. South Africa is the developing  country
in the world with the best performance figures. We have maintained a  growth
rate of 3%,  or  nearly  3%  for  a  considerable  time  now  and  no  other
developing country can hold a candle to us. On the  contrary,  many  of  the
developing countries in the world are far worse  off,  and  the  hon  Trevor
Manuel must receive personal credit for that and we wish him  everything  of
the best.

Of course, there is room for improvement and I hope that in future  we  will
also be able to have pleasant debates here on matters with regard  to  which
we think there can be improvement, and in the interests of South  Africa  we
will do that gladly. Not as negatively  as  "His  Master's  Voice"  or  "big
business" here amongst the  pink  progs  on  my  left  want  to  do  by  now
abstaining from voting. It is typical of them to throw  their  toys  out  of
the cot if they do not get their way. They speak on behalf of  big  business
and big companies. Sir, this is a patriot who does not care for the poor  in
this country - does not care two hoots for them. That  is  the  reason  they
are carrying on so today. And there we once again  have  a  typical  example
today.

This legislation regarding amnesty  for  money  taken  out  of  the  country
illegally - please note illegally, because it is legal to take R750 000  out
- is, I think, a good piece  of  legislation.  I  believe  it  will  improve
investor confidence. It will  bring  about  greater  certainty  and  greater
predictability, particularly for investors.  Personally,  I  am  sorry,  hon
Minister,  that  only  natural  persons,  individuals,  close  corporations,
trusts and also estates -  deceased  estates  -  will  qualify.  It  is  not
entirely acceptable to me that companies are excluded, merely "because  they
operate under a wholly separate, discretionary regime".

I would like to hear from the Minister  a  further  explanation  as  to  why
companies are being excluded from this amnesty. I think it could bring  much
more  money  into  the  country  if  we  could  also  extend  it  to   these
institutions, and I would like to know from the  Minister  whether  it  will
not be possible in future for us also  to  make  these  concessions  to  his
guests. We also need that extra money for investors in South Africa to  make
investments,  so  that  job  opportunities  can  be  created,  and  we   can
successfully address the poverty issue in South  Africa.  The  New  NP  will
support this legislation. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call the hon  M  A  Tarr.
This is the hon member's maiden speech in this Chamber. [Applause.]

Mr M A TARR: Chair, this is not my maiden speech in this Chamber as  I  have
spoken here before, but it is certainly my maiden speech for the ANC  and  I
can happily tell members with whom I used to be that I have at last  arrived
where I should have been long ago. [Applause.]

I find the attitude of the DA towards this Bill absolutely  surprising.  The
Bill is important for this country, because  there  will  be  an  inflow  of
money coming into the country, and that will lead to investment, growth  and
jobs. It is also important to persons who are outside the  country  so  that
they can regularise their affairs and put themselves on the  right  side  of
the law.
The hon Taljaard actually raised  her  issues  in  the  portfolio  committee
meetings, or in many of them she did, but  unfortunately  I  never,  at  any
stage, saw any proposed amendments that would put the imperfections, or  the
so-called imperfections, right.  [Interjections.]  She  could  have  amended
them in the committee.

There are members there who get adequate opportunities to speak, and I  wish
their Whips would give them a chance sometime. The DA has  repeatedly  heard
the Minister, they have repeatedly heard Sars assure people  that  there  is
no hidden agenda whatsoever behind this Bill. At no stage is the Bill  going
to be used as a  witch-hunt  against  people  who  have  been  applying  for
indemnity. The Bill is being crafted and written in such a way  that  anyone
who reads it can quite clearly see this. But no, that  is  not  good  enough
for them.

The DA sees fit to cast doubts in the minds of  potential  amnesty  seekers.
[Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: Absolutely not.
Mr M A  TARR:  Well,  then  I  didn't  understand  what  Ms  Taljaard  said.
[Interjections.] There's doubt in the minds of  potential  amnesty  seekers,
so the speech or their attitude could  possibly  contribute  towards  people
who would ask for amnesty perhaps standing back and  saying:  "Hey,  there's
some hidden agenda here, perhaps I'd better not apply for amnesty".

Surely a responsible opposition would be encouraging  people  to  apply  for
amnesty? Surely they would want to see this  money  flowing  back  into  the
country? Surely they would want to see investment? But,  no,  they  seem  to
have some other agenda. I know what their agenda is. The fact that  the  ANC
is doing an excellent job of running this country is something  their  minds
just cannot get to grips with. [Interjections.]

The Oxford Dictionary defines amnesty as  "an  intentional  overlooking,  an
act of oblivion, a general overlooking or pardon of  past  offences  by  the
ruling party". Obviously, as other speakers have said, there must have  been
an offence; one with which I think the Government has  been  extraordinarily
generous in the extent to which they are prepared to overlook it.

Money has been moved out  of  the  country,  illegally,  for  decades  by  a
variety  of  means,  with  which  we  are   all   familiar:   overinvoicing;
underinvoicing; purchasing foreign banknotes and even carrying them  out  in
suitcases; purchasing assets such as antiques, yachts, carpets  and  sending
them out; unspent portions of travel allowances staying overseas; etc.

The details of this Bill are well known, so I don't want to dwell  on  them.
However, it is actually very interesting to have a look  at  a  bit  of  the
background behind the Bill. Why do people want to move their money out?  Why
were individuals so keen to get their money out  of  South  Africa?  Because
basically they had no faith  in  the  future.  They  were  actually  getting
themselves out of the country as well, and most of them were  supporters  of
the party on my left.

In fact, I'm sure that that party gets more votes  in  Australia  than  they
get here. There was an amazing mindset at the time, and  it  went  something
like this: Apartheid is not going to work. This country is going to  end  up
in chaos after apartheid. When the new Government comes in they will not  be
able to run the show, so for God's sake get your money out and  yourself  as
well, if you possibly can.  [Interjections.]  That  was  the  attitude  that
prevailed at the time.

But what has now happened? What has  changed?  What  has  actually  changed?
What has changed is a change in mindset. The long and the short  of  it  is,
of course, as the Minister pointed out  in  his  introductory  speech,  that
there are billions of rand illegally overseas  that  people  would  like  to
repatriate, and the only  way  to  do  this  is  via  amnesty.  The  obvious
question is then: Why do the same people,  who  were  so  desperate  to  get
their money out 10 or 15 years ago, now want to get it  back?  It  is  worth
dwelling on this for a moment, because obviously people in those ranks  over
there spend so much time nit-picking that they actually don't  see  the  big
picture.

Let's look at the big picture. Let's look at it.  We  have  been  through  a
peaceful transition, something nobody else ...  [Interjections.]  Mr  Chair,
can I have protection from this hon member here? I am sure he  will  get  an
opportunity to make his speech some time? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Could  we  have  order  here.  Hon
members, there is a limit to the amount of interjections you can make.

Mr M A TARR: This country has been through a peaceful transition,  something
nobody else could have done, that nobody in those  ranks  there  could  have
ever done.

Inflation is under control. The economy has  weathered  storms  and  it  has
weathered enormous structural change. Tax rates have declined, foreign  debt
has declined, and foreign exchange regulations have been  relaxed.  Services
such as housing, water, schooling, electricity, etc, have been  extended  to
the poorest of the  poor,  and  continue  to  be.  Previously  disadvantaged
people are entering fields where they had no success. So  in  terms  of  the
reality, I think I make my point. Things  have  fundamentally  changed  from
the time when the people who are sitting out there took their money  out  of
the country, and they now want to bring it back.

I think sometimes to the disappointment of the DA,  South  Africa  has  done
incredibly well under the ANC Government. We  are  now  in  a  situation  in
which the people who took money illegally out of the country want  to  bring
it back. Things have worked out differently  to  what  people  thought  they
would, and the ANC can indeed deliver.

You know, many years ago I sat in this Parliament as a predecessor  of  that
party - it  was  then  the  PFP.  We  were  a  small  party  in  those  days
overwhelmed by a lot of National Party members. I used to have a dream  that
one day the National Party would be sitting in the opposition  benches.  The
gods have  been  kind  because,  in  fact,  they  are.  The  name  might  be
different, but there they sit, and the most amazing thing is that, in  fact,
many of the faces are still exactly the same. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Many of the policies are exactly the  same  as  well.  I  look  at  the  by-
election in Oudtshoorn - "swart gevaar". [Interjections.] "Swart gevaar"  is
alive and well in those benches, and, as I said, the gods have  indeed  been
kind to me in that I can now see the  old  National  Party  sitting  in  the
opposition benches, where they should be. [Interjections.]  But  it's  true,
you use it in every by-election. [Interjections.] I will use it, as long  as
you use it in by-elections. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Mr M A TARR: With this Bill, the Government has taken great pains to  ensure
that there will be no  repercussions  on  persons  who  apply  for  amnesty.
Individuals  will  be  able  to  repatriate  their  funds  without  fear  of
prosecution in terms of exchange controls or tax regulations.
It gives me pleasure to support this Bill  on  behalf  of  the  ANC,  and  I
certainly hope that all persons will take advantage of this legislation  and
help make a contribution to our nation. Thank you, Mr Chair. [Applause.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Voorsitter, die ACDP sal  ook  hierdie  wetsontwerp  steun.  Ek
dink dis 'n bekende feit dat die agb Kent Durr oor 'n redelike klompie  jare
al  baie  aanvoorwerk  gedoen  het  en  'n  groot  kampvegter  was  vir  die
instelling van 'n vorm van amnestie vir die oortredings  van  wederregtelike
verwydering van geld uit Suid-Afrika.

Alhoewel ons 'n  bekommernis  het  oor  die  wetgewing,  in  terme  van  die
bereiking van sy doelwitte, is dit tog ons oortuiging dat  daar  baie  mense
is wat hul  geld  wil  terugbring  Suid-Afrika  toe,  en  dat  deur  hierdie
amnestie hulle die geleentheid gaan  kry  om  dit  te  kan  doen  sonder  om
nadelige gevolge te hê en onder baie spesifieke voorwaardes. Daar  is  egter
die mening dat daar baie mense is wat dit nie gaan doen nie en gevolglik  is
die bekommernis oor die sukses  van  hierdie  wetgewing,  soos  deur  vorige
sprekers uitgewys, ook ons bekommernis. Maar, wat ookal  die  resultaat  is,
dit gaan beter wees as wat ons het op die oomblik en gevolglik sal  'n  mens
hierdie spesifieke wetgewing noodwendig moet steun.

Ons wil tog 'n beroep op die agb Minister doen om vir ons, as  dit  moontlik
is, ná die einde van die vensterperiode terugvoer te gee oor  die  resultate
van hierdie oefening. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, the ACDP will also support this Bill. I  think  it
is a well-known fact that the hon Kent Durr has been doing the  ground  work
for a number of years and that he was a huge champion  for  the  institution
of a form of amnesty for the transgressions of  unlawful  removal  of  money
from South Africa.

Even though we have a concern regarding this legislation, in  terms  of  the
achievement of its goals, we are convinced that there are  many  people  who
will return their money to South Africa, and that through this amnesty  they
will be given the opportunity  to  do  so  without  incurring  damages,  and
subject to very specific conditions.  However,  there  is  an  opinion  that
there are many people who will not do this and consequently the concern  for
the success of this legislation, as mentioned by previous speakers, is  also
our concern. But, irrespective of the results,  this  will  be  better  than
what we have at the moment and therefore  one  will  have  to  support  this
specific legislation.

We do appeal to the hon Minister to give feedback to us at the  end  of  the
window period, if it is possible, as regards the results of  this  exercise.
Thank you.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. The shifting of assets offshore  in
contravention of the exchange control regulations has sadly  been  practised
for a number of years. The same is noted with the violation  of  income  tax
laws by the illegal holding of foreign assets since 1997.

Though the MF is disturbed by these practices  and  would  have  wanted  the
long arm of the law to  be  the  tool  to  correct  this,  it  supports  the
Government's aim to encourage individuals to regularise  their  tax  affairs
and repatriate some or all of their foreign assets.

It is indeed  a  difficult  task  to  accomplish,  but  regulatory  reforms,
enhanced law enforcement  and  the  international  exchange  of  information
overriding bank confidentiality standards and a frontal attack on tax  haven
countries apply pressure through economic and legislative factors.

Though to many the bending of rules in relation to banking secrecy may  seem
like contravention, in view  of  this  rife  violation  the  MF  feels  that
accommodation should  be  made,  with  strict  procedures,  to  attain  such
information.

The MF further supports the establishment of a separate body  to  deal  with
amnesty applications made by exchange  control  and  income  tax  violators,
overseen by the Minister and the chairperson.

The MF supports the Exchange Control Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation  Laws
Bill. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter en agb Minister, daar  is  twee  oorwegings  as
ons na hierdie wetgewing kyk  -  die  finansiële  en  die  morele.  Van  die
finansiële kant kan ek finansiële kennis aanhaal wat sê  dit  is  die  regte
tyd vir so 'n  tipe  ding,  dat  vanweë  strenger  wetgewing  wêreldwyd  dit
moeiliker word om geld in die buiteland weg te steek en dat die  gety  draai
dat mense hulle geld hiernatoe bring. Dis 'n goeie tyd en ons gaan  daardeur
ook heelwat geld inwin en ook die belastingbasis verbreed. Dis positief.

Ook wat die morele betref, ek dink dis 'n Bybelse beginsel. U kan maar  lees
daar in Levitikus van so eenmaal in sewe jaar  -  die  jubeljaar  -  wanneer
skuld afgeskryf word en selfs van eenmaal in vyftig jaar  wanneer  kriminele
klagte ook afgeskryf word. Ons wil hierdie wetgewing dus  graag  steun.  Dis
goed om skoon te kom. In hierdie  stadium  wil  ons  almal  vra  om  daarvan
gebruik te maak.
Maar, ek wil graag op 'n ander saak wys. In hierdie Huis word  daar  gereeld
beskuldigings gemaak van  'n  bepaalde  party  wat  partypolitiek  maak  van
alles. Ek wil vra dat u ná hierdie debat die Hansard gaan lees  en  dan  kyk
ons wie het  vandag  partypolitiek  gemaak.  In  alle  eerlikheid,  die  agb
Taljaard het argumente suiwer op die punt af genoem. Sy het nie eenkeer  die
man gespeel nie; sy het suiwer wetenskaplike argumente  genoem.  En  die  DP
doen die verantwoordelike ding om nie die speelgoed uit die kot uit te  gooi
nie; om nie die wetsontwerp te opponeer en te sê ons staan eenkant.  En  wie
skree?

Ek dink dis tyd dat van die ander partye 'n slag in die spieël kyk wie  maak
politieke punte van elke saak in hierdie Huis. Ek dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson and hon Minister,  there  are  two  things  to
consider when looking at this Act - the financial and the  moral.  From  the
financial side I can quote financial expertise that states that  it  is  the
right time for this type of thing,  that  because  of  stricter  legislation
worldwide it has become more difficult to hide money  in  foreign  countries
and that the tide is turning as far as people bringing their money  to  this
country is concerned. It is a good time and we  will  also  gain  a  lot  of
money and broaden the tax base. That is positive.

Regarding the moral side, too, I think it is a Biblical principle.  You  can
read in Leviticus about how, once every seven years - the year of jubilee  -
debts were written off, and even about how, once every  50  years,  criminal
charges were also written off. We therefore  really  want  to  support  this
legislation. It is good to  come  clean.  At  this  stage  we  want  to  ask
everybody to make use of this.

But I also want to refer to another issue.  A  certain  party  is  regularly
accused in this House of turning everything into party politics. And I  want
to ask that you go and read the Hansard afterwards and see  who  has  played
party politics today. In all honesty, the arguments put forward by  the  hon
Taljaard were purely to the point. Not  once  did  she  play  the  man;  she
advanced purely scientific arguments. And the DP is  doing  the  responsible
thing in not throwing its toys out of the cot; in not opposing the Bill  and
saying that we stand on the sideline. And who is doing the yelling?

I think it is time some of the other parties took a look in the  mirror  for
a change and figured out who is trying to  make  political  capital  out  of
every issue in this House. I thank you.]

Dr P J RABIE: Mr Chairman, hon Minister, hon members,  I'll  confine  myself
to the context of this Bill. The Exchange Control Amnesty and  Amendment  of
Taxation Laws Bill was announced by the hon Minister in  his  Budget  Speech
on 26 February. This Bill will enable South African  residents  to  disclose
their foreign unaccounted assets that have  accumulated  without  having  to
face any criminal or civil liability.

The DA is not opposed to this Bill  in  principle  and  this  Bill  must  be
evaluated in a historic context before the R750 000 offshore  allowance  was
allowed. The main objective of this Bill is to allow offshore  funds  to  be
repatriated back into the South African economy, provided  that  individuals
or legal entities comply with the set window period and that the  individual
or interested parties have not  been  under  investigation  for  illegal  or
unlawful practices prior to application for amnesty.

South  Africa  is  part  of  the  global  economy,  which  at   present   is
experiencing a downturn. In terms of real growth in  assets  many  residents
with unaccounted offshore assets have generally,  in  real  terms,  suffered
losses. The rather bleak state of affairs can be  compared  with  the  South
African situation of positive economic  growth  with  a  broad  spectrum  of
investment opportunities.

This Bill is technical, and a wide range of interested parties  submitted  a
number of submissions regarding  the  precise  wording  of  this  Bill.  The
definitions that relate to advisers versus facilitators  and  the  reporting
requirements and provision of facilitators will have to be further defined.
The report in Business Day dated 25 March 2003  mentioned  that  legislation
was in the pipeline that would allow financial  advisers  to  apply  for  an
exemption under the Act to enable them to advise their clients  to  complete
applications for contravention of exchange controls and  tax  avoidance  and
this is a clear indication that  this  Bill  will  have  to  be  amended  in
future. And it's imperfect in its present state.

Mnr die Voorsitter,  hierdie  wetsontwerp  verwys  ook  na  die  toegang  na
betroubare inligting - die berging en domisilie  van  vertroulike  inligting
deur die Tesourie ... [Mr Chairman, this  Bill  also  refers  to  access  to
reliable information - the storage and domicile of confidential  information
by the Treasury ...]

... and specific transgressions that relate to  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Act, the amnesty unit, its composition, etc, and the procedure to  be
followed to attain approval for amnesty.

The Exchange Control Amnesty and Amendment of Taxation Laws Bill  is  not  a
tax Bill that will result in forcing South Africans to pay more  taxes.  The
basic aim is to  curb  money-laundering,  bolster  investor  confidence  and
strengthen the rand in future to allow unaccounted assets held  offshore  to
be repatriated into the South African economy.

The DA is a responsible opposition and we think it's our  duty  to  identify
certain wording within this Act. We will abstain. Thank you, Mr Chairman.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the noise  level  is  too
high. Order, hon members!

Mr B A MNGUNI: Chair, there has been political amnesty in the  form  of  the
TRC. We are completing  that  process,  and  are  now  giving  you  economic
amnesty to declare your sins, come clean and pay your taxes. The  DA  should
take this opportunity with both hands  and  encourage  its  constituency  to
come clean and be responsible citizens.

Besides the amnesty given, this Bill also puts into effect  the  tax  relief
measures announced by the Minister in his Budget Speech.  I  would  like  to
highlight a  few  of  these.  In  order  to  encourage  the  acquisition  of
property, stamp duty is no longer applicable. Also, when you buy a house  or
a property, you no longer have to pay estate duty if the  property  is  less
than R140 000, and you pay a maximum of 8% if  the  property  is  valued  at
R320 000 or above.

Furthermore, to encourage saving, interest or dividends that  accumulate  or
that are paid to individuals are no longer taxed if those dividends or  that
interest is less than R6 000 if you are below 65 years of age,  or  R15  000
if you are  65  and  older.  That  will  encourage  saving,  investment  and
economic growth.

Some of these issues were also highlighted by Dr Woods. As a result  of  the
legal definition of "resident", the companies operating in South Africa  and
elsewhere were able to avoid paying tax. This  Bill  tries  to  align  those
laws, taxes and treaties. We have tax treaties with  other  countries.  This
Bill aligns those  treaties  in  line  with  the  amnesty  Bill  to  prevent
companies from avoiding tax payment by claiming to be operating  in  another
country, whereas they  are  operating  in  South  Africa.  This  also  helps
prevent those individuals or companies from double taxation.

We said that big companies are not included in this  amnesty.  This  is  not
due to discrimination but because  of  differentiation.  As  individuals  we
differ in salary scales and have different tax brackets. This does not  mean
that, because I'm in a certain tax bracket and another person is in  another
tax bracket, I'm being  discriminated  against.  This  is  just  because  we
belong to different categories of taxes.  The  same  applies  to  companies.
They  are  excluded  from  this  amnesty  because  they  belong  to  another
differentiation,  not  because  they  are   being   discriminated   against.
Furthermore, there is another dispensation for companies because  they  were
able to take some funds offshore.

Regarding the retention of records, unfortunately the DA has said  from  the
beginning that the Bill is poorly crafted - even before we could finish  the
Bill. The reason was that they wanted each and every  thing  the  powers  of
the amnesty unit, its functions and so forth, to be spelt out  in  the  Bill
or the Bill would not be properly crafted. They said that  if  we  left  all
the powers and functions in the Bill to the Minister or whoever  else,  then
they would become delegated regulations. We could put all those  powers  and
functions of the amnesty in the Bill, then it  would  be  cluttered  and  it
would not be proper. That is why we  left  out  those  issues  or  from  the
powers and functions of the Bill.

Regarding the retention of records, the hon Taljaard knows that  there  will
be no  witch-hunt  of  people  who  disclose  that  they  have  taken  money
offshore. She herself knows that the Government will  not  yield  and  break
its own laws, because she applied the Promotion  of  Access  to  Information
Act. She wanted the Saambou report to be presented to her so that she  could
see what happened in the collapse of Saambou  -  official  information  that
was sensitive for the economy of South Africa and was kept for the  good  of
the country. The governor refused to give her that report because  of  state
interest. She knows perfectly well that those records, if kept  by  National
Treasury or Sars for that matter, are  not  going  to  be  released  to  any
government agency that is going to conduct a witch-hunt.

This Bill makes the  economic  environment  in  South  Africa  conducive  to
investment for anybody who wants to operate economically  in  South  Africa.
Therefore the DA must make sure that it goes back to  its  constituency  and
encourages people to apply for amnesty so that they come clean, and  make  a
decent profit in South Africa without having  a  sword  hanging  over  their
heads. What will happen once the amnesty period ends is that whoever  hasn't
applied and has got money overseas will face the  full  might  of  the  law.
Will  the  DA  by  that  time  be  saying  that   they   represented   their
constituencies properly? That would not be the case  and  it  will  only  be
their constituencies that will  suffer,  should  they  not  apply  for  that
amnesty. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I think it's important for the  record
to go back to some of the rationale that informed  the  legislation  and  to
issues that some members in this  House  are  continuing  to  whinge  about,
because we're no longer at the stage of asking questions.

The first issue  relates  to  the  exclusion  of  companies.  Now,  firstly,
companies that had operated legally in South Africa,  even  under  apartheid
when they sought to be  involved  in  sanctions-busting,  did  so  with  the
approval of the Reserve Bank. Their position is a legal position.

What we cannot countenance is a situation in which we merely write  off  for
those companies that have been involved in  transfer  pricing.  It's  wrong,
and if companies have acted  in  a  way  that  violates  not  only  exchange
control legislation and in some instances, the Income Tax  Act  as  well  as
the Companies Act, they can't now seek  exclusions  and  amnesty  under  the
provisions of this Act. It's wrong, it's going to remain wrong, and  we  are
not going to bring them into this or the next amnesty. I'm very clear  about
that.

If they seek a constitutional route, which I doubt that many of  them  would
be foolish enough to attempt,  they  would  merely  be  showing  their  hand
because they would have been involved in subterfuge  and  illegal  activity.
In the present circumstances in the spirit of this  legislation,  we  should
not support them. They've been wrong; they will remain wrong in the eyes  of
the law.

In respect of the retention of records, except for  Kazakhstan  and  perhaps
that is the reference that the hon Taljaard makes, we can't find  any  other
circumstance in which records may not be maintained. In fact, in respect  of
successful applicants, it's going to be important that their records can  be
referred to Sars or the Reserve Bank so that their matters  can  be  brought
into order, failing which they will remain on the wrong  side  of  the  law.
This is because the Reserve Bank and the Revenue Service  would  be  outside
the evaluation of their applications.

In respect of the call that the Auditor-General  be  the  custodian  of  the
records, I think that diligent members of the committee would know that  the
Auditor-General has said that that was outside his purview. Also, we have  a
responsibility in terms of the National Archives  of  South  Africa  Act  to
ensure that we don't just wilfully destroy records. That was  the  stuff  of
the apartheid regime. That is why we had such a paucity of information  when
we came into office in 1994,  because  they  shredded  like  mad.  We  can't
repeat the same mistakes, so don't ask us to behave in that way.

In respect of the issue  of  advisers  and  facilitators,  yes,  within  the
committee there were some individuals who may have  been  involved  in  some
very bad activities who raised the issue of a witch-hunt. However, in  terms
of the position we've taken we are, in fact, very clear that we cannot  open
a witch-hunt. The legislation is  clear,  and  I  have  no  fear  about  the
position and the distinction made between advisers  and  facilitators.  That
deals with the technical issues.

Let me deal with some of the other issues that have  been  raised.  The  hon
Rabie sits here as a lawmaker. He's had  access  to  the  legislation  right
since 26 February.  We've  participated,  even  though  Parliament,  in  the
context of a money Bill, doesn't normally have the  power  to  amend.  We've
allowed for engagement. Instead of using that  facility,  he  refers  to  an
article in the Business Day as though  that  is  the  authoritative  source.
Well, their journalist so often gets it wrong,  Mr  Rabie.  [Interjections.]
You can't refer to that as authoritative when you  have  had  the  power  in
your hands, in respect of this legislation. That merely  indicates  why  you
are sitting on that side of the House.

In respect of the hon Aucamp ... Ek weet nou nie of die "A" in "NA" deel  is
van die "DA"  soos  die  "FA"  ook  deel  is  van  die  "DA"  nie.  [Gelag.]
[Applous.] Ek weet nie of jy nou 'n bietjie kruip by  hulle  nie,  maar  ons
los maar dit vir nou. [Tussenwerpsels.] [...  I  do  not  know  whether  the
``A'' in ``NA'' is part of the ``DA'' just as the ``FA''  is  also  part  of
the ``DA''. [Laughter.] [Applause.] I do not know whether  you  are  sucking
up to them somewhat, but let us leave it at that for now. [Interjections.]]

In respect  of  the  hon  Taljaard,  your  suggestions  are  actually  quite
impractical. They are uninformed. You can't hold us to  ransom.  However,  I
think, very clearly they suggest why many of  those  who  have  taken  money
offshore, who would nominally have been supporters  of  the  DP,  would  not
want to associate with this party  in  the  future.  Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  I  put  the  Bill  with  the  textual
corrections, as requested by the Minister of Finance, namely, one, that  the
word "or" in clause 10(1)(b)(iii) on page 9, line  33  be  replaced  by  the
word "and"; and, two, that the words "failed to confirm" in clause  10(1)(c)
on page 9, line 34 be replaced by the word "confirmed".

Bill, with the textual corrections, read a first time  (Democratic  Alliance
abstaining).

        EXCHANGE CONTROL AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

There was no debate.

Bill, with the textual corrections, read a second time (Democratic  Alliance
abstaining).

The House adjourned at 17:59.
