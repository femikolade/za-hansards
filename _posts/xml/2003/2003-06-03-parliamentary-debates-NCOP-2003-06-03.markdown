                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) calls upon the Government to make an urgent  study  of  the  interest
       rate debacle where the Department of Statistics  understated  certain
       information which has skewed inflation projections;


  (2) requests the Government to put particular emphasis on the impact upon
       the division of revenue and upon the equitable  share  provinces  and
       local authorities receive, with  a  view  to  adjusting  and  perhaps
       amending medium-term and long-term budgets in the provinces and local
       authorities.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at
the next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


     notes that -


     (1)    in certain areas, especially  on  the  Cape  Flats,  responsible
         citizens live in fear that a bullet fired by a gangster could  kill
         or harm them or their children, and therefore the New  NP  welcomes
         the announcement made yesterday by Safety  and  Security  Minister,
         Charles Nqakula, about the deployment of  over  6Â 000  recruits  in
         the Western Cape to tackle gangsterism and violence;


     (2)    apart from the 3 212  recruits  who  will  be  deployed  in  the
         Western Cape, a further 2 850  will  be  trained  in  the  province
         during  the  new  financial  year,  and  members  of  the  Pretoria
         intervention unit will also be deployed at crime  hotspots  in  the
         province;


     (3)    the DA recycled the New NP's proposal of deploying  more  police
         officers on the streets, and once again the DA has  been  so  eager
         to find fault that they  have  failed  to  take  into  account  the
         Department of Safety and Security's actions to  combat  crime,  and
         is now trying to instruct the department to do what it  is  already
         in the process of doing; and


     (4)    the DA can only score cheap political points with pie in the sky
         statements, and the New NP can, and is prepared to, assist to  make
         things happen.

[Interjections.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall move at the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the unfortunate incident where 62 steam-train enthusiasts  from
       overseas were ordered off a train only four days before  the  end  of
       their 18 day journey because of disagreements over costs;


  (2) further notes that the overseas organiser of the  steam-train  safari
       has been arranging such tour groups to South Africa for 14 years;


  (3) regrets the damage that has been caused to our  tourism  industry  by
       this incident; and


  (4) calls on the tourism authorities to assist Union  Limited  Railtours,
       the company which controls steam-trains in this country,  to  develop
       more professional systems for dealing with its clients.

         CONGRATULATIONS TO WESTERN CAPE MEC FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and congratulates the Western Cape MEC for Safety and Security,
       Mr Leonard Ramatlakane, on the giant step made by his department;


  (2) also notes that government resources have been redirected to areas of
       the poor which were previously neglected;


  (3) further  notes  that  budget  priorities  are  targeting  real  crime
       hotspots, particularly in trains; and


  (4) believes that redirecting resources will help to root  out  criminals
       wherever they exist, and not only in the central business district.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    CONTINUED ATTACKS ON CIVILIANS IN DRC

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) condemns in the strongest terms the continued attacks on civilians by
       the militia group in which 352 people died in the Democratic Republic
       of Congo;


  (2) supports the call by President Thabo Mbeki for the United Nations  to
       deploy peacekeeping troops with powers to fire at  those  who  attack
       civilians;


  (3) believes that it is through a negotiated settlement that the problems
       of the Democratic Republic of Congo can be resolved;


  (4) calls on leaders of these  militia  groups  to  stop  this  senseless
       killing and give peace a chance;


  (5) supports the call by President Thabo Mbeki in its fullest sense.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 REIGN OF TERROR OF FARMER IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with horror newspaper reports that a farmer  stands  accused  of
           having released a reign of terror, assaulting and  maiming  many
           workers on his farm in KwaZulu-Natal;


       (b)  that, in the latest incident two weeks ago, the farmer allegedly
           attempted to run over a five-year-old girl, Zami Nkosi, with his
           bakkie;


       (c)  that 17 other charges, which range  from  assault  to  attempted
           murder, are still being investigated against the farmer; and


       (d)  that the farmer has allegedly refused a Sowetan  team  entry  to
           his farm, threatening to shoot ``any trespassers";


  (2) deplores such actions in the strongest possible terms; and


  (3) calls on the relevant  authorities  to  thoroughly  investigate  this
       matter.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on  a  point  of  order:  I  am  under  the
impression that this situation that was described here must be seen  as  sub
judice and the Council can't take a vote on it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  The  Council  can't
vote on it, as it is sub judice. Is the matter  being  investigated  at  the
present moment? Is there anyone who can ...
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, I  am  not  too  certain,
but, indeed, if it is sub judice, I don't think we can rule on  it.  So,  Mr
Van Niekerk would then be correct. We have to rely  on  his  good  judgement
and perhaps defer a decision until we have investigated the matter.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Will  you  check
whether the matter is being investigated at the moment? We will not  take  a
decision at the present moment. We don't have to  debate  it,  Ma  Vilakazi.
We'll look into the matter and we'll rule on it. The matter will be  printed
anyway.

                   AFRICAN PLIGHT HIGHLIGHTED AT G8 SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs C NKUNA: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends President Thabo Mbeki  and  Presidents  Wade,  Obasanjo  and
       Bouteflika in their attempts to bring the plight of Africans  to  the
       G8 summit;


  (2) notes that attempts by these statesmen have not gone unnoticed by the
       G8 countries; and


  (3) welcomes the pledge  by  the  G8  to  establish  a  peacekeeping  and
       intervention force for the continent.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 MONEY OWED TO MUNICIPALITIES BY GOVERNMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  the reply by the Minister for Provincial and Local Government to
           a written question by Mr P A Matthee from which it is clear that
           there are some departments of the national Government  and  some
           provincial governments that owe money to certain  municipalities
           for services rendered;


       (b)  that an initiative to  obtain  detailed  information  about  the
           exact amounts owed was to be completed by the end of  May  2003;
           and


       (c)   that  the  information  will  now  be  made  available  to  the
           respective departments and provincial governments; and


  (2) in the  light  of  the  above  and  the  fact  that  there  are  many
       municipalities desperately needing all the  money  owed  to  them  to
       enable them to continue the proper delivery  of  services,  therefore
       requests all Ministers, Directors-General of national departments and
       Premiers and provincial governments to see to  it  that  all  amounts
       owed to municipalities are paid as soon as possible, but in any event
       within thirty days of the  rendering  of  the  service  by  the  said
       municipality.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              SUCCESS OF LOCALLY PRODUCED CHILDREN'S PROGRAMME

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great appreciation that our  locally  produced  children's
       programme Takalani Sesame was recently hailed as the "best children's
       programme in the world";


  (2) congratulates this programme for also having won the Grand Jury Award
       at the International World  Media  Festival  in  Hamburg  in  Germany
       recently; and


  (3) is of the view that we can be proud to be South Africans in the light
       of the  fact  that  the  whole  programme  is  researched,  produced,
       directed and filmed in our motherland, South Africa.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      POLICE HELD HOSTAGE IN MPUMALANGA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns in no uncertain terms the actions of the criminals who  held
       police hostage at Kabokweni police station in Mpumalanga;


  (2) applauds the police special forces who effected the  release  of  the
       hostages this morning; and


  (3) sympathises with the injured police persons and wishes them a  speedy
       recovery.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

             Debate on Vote No 34 - Water Affairs and Forestry:

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS  AND  FORESTRY:  Deputy  Chairperson  and  hon
members, while I am  presenting  my  budget  to  the  National  Assembly  on
Friday, I am always happy to be here. Ndiyavuya  ukuthetha  kule  Ndlu[I  am
pleased to speak in this House.]

Water resource management is a national competence, but  agriculture,  which
uses the most water, is a provincial one. Regulation of commercial  forestry
is  national,  but  provinces  have  specific  responsibilities  for  nature
conservation, particularly the administration  of  our  indigenous  forests.
When local  government  has  difficulty  with  water  services,  it  is  the
province that must intervene first.

Starting with water services ... meer geld as ooit tevore  is  toegeken  aan
my departement vir nuwe projekte. [... more money than ever before has  been
allocated to my department for new projects.]

One billion two hundred and five million rands which will be  topped  up  to
over R1,5 billion through the generous assistance of donors.  This  will  be
distributed as follows: Western Cape R16 million, Northern Cape 47  million,
Eastern Cape R239  million,  Free  State  R51  million,  KwaZulu-Natal  R278
million, Mpumalanga R115 million,  Limpopo  R256  million,  North  West  R87
million and Gauteng R11 million.

Next month we celebrate the nine millionth person to  gain  access  to  safe
water through this programme, Impumelelo  Enkulu.  Providing  infrastructure
is not enough. It must be  effectively  managed.  The  ground  to  fund  the
operation and maintenance done by my department in providing  water  through
over 1 500 schemes across the country has also been substantially  increased
by almost R300 million to almost R1 billion.

This grant, in kind, to local  government,  in  addition  to  the  equitable
share of revenue, enables us  to  fund  free  basic  water  in  the  poorest
communities of the country. Metsi  a  mahala  go  batho  ba  ba  sa  kgoneng
[Supply free water to those who cannot afford it.]

One of the conditions for using these funds is  that  over  the  next  three
years the water and sanitation schemes operated by my department, should  be
transferred to 84 municipalities. The 1  500  schemes  transferred  comprise
over 27 000 different elements  of  infrastructure  such  as  pipes,  pumps,
sections, stations, treatment works, etc., with a replacement value  of  R10
billion.

The transfer  process  is  being  managed  by  a  team,  National  Treasury,
Department  of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  (DPLG),  Salga  and   my
department. We will establish  policies  for  transfer,  guide  local  level
transfer negotiations and ensure that services are  maintained  during  that
process.

Over 8 000  elements  of  the  infrastructure  will  be  refurbished  before
transfer and that is costing us R700 million.  With  R116  million  budgeted
this  year,  refurbishment  is  required  because  of  the  ageing  process.
However, some maintenance has been delayed due to budget constraints.

I  regret  to  say,  hon  members,  that  vandalism  and  theft  have   been
substantial problems and I appeal to members to  help  us  build  the  right
culture in this country. Sakhe amasiko enhlonipho  ezakhiweni  zomphakhathi.
[Let us build a culture of respect for public buildings.]

The  refurbishment  requirements  have  been   clearly   identified.   Their
completion will  ensure  that  fully  functional  schemes  are  transferred.
Negotiations are under way for the transfer of 8000  departmental  staff  to
operate the schemes. Surveys have been done of  staffing  requirements,  and
any overstaffing will be dealt with in terms of current  agreements  on  the
restructuring of the public sector.

While the transfer is a major challenge for the  municipalities,  Government
established them to provide these  services,  and  the  department,  working
under the umbrella of DPLG, will continue  the  intensive  capacity-building
work that is under way. Our programme is to complete the transfers  by  June
2005. Ninety schemes have to be completed during this  financial  year,  and
all conditional grants must be phased  out  by  2011,  at  which  stage  the
conditional grants will be incorporated into the equitable share  allocation
to local government.

We are also working out management arrangements  for  the  consolidation  of
infrastructure  grants  to  local  government  into   a   single   municipal
infrastructure grant. In terms of the Division  of  Revenue  Act,  this  new
conditional grant which will be phased in over the  next  three  years  will
fall under the DPLG.
My department's mandate will still ensure that the basic  water  supply  and
sanitation  needs  of  our  people  are  met  as  soon  as  possible  in   a
sustainable, affordable way. I will use all the instruments at  my  disposal
to achieve our agreed national goals for the provision  of  clean  water  to
all by 2008, and the provision of basic sanitation by the year 2010.

We will also seek to ensure  that  projects  continue  to  use  labour-based
approaches  which  last  year  generated  over  25  000  person   years   of
employment. During last year over R220 million was spent on  the  sanitation
programme and 65 000 household toilets were constructed. Health and  hygiene
education, an integral part of sanitation,  was  provided  to  approximately
400 000 people, with the Department of Health playing a crucial role.

Taking into account the programme of  the  department  to  provincial  local
government and housing, over 396 000 toilets were  constructed  and  reduced
the national backlog to 16,7  million.  Hon  members,  in  1994  it  was  21
million.  Sanitation  delivery  was  slow  and  it  is  now   beginning   to
accelerate.

For the coming financial year my department has allocated over R320  million
to local government for sanitation. Our target is to build 120  000  toilets
a year as part of the national target of 300 000 per annum by government  as
a whole. If we can achieve this  rate  of  delivery,  we  should  reach  our
target by 2010.

The breakdown is: Western Cape 3 million, Northern Cape 18 million,  Eastern
Cape  71  million,  Free  State  44  million,  KwaZulu-Natal   60   million,
Mpumalanga 37 million,  Limpopo  36  million,  North  West  45  million  and
Gauteng 6 million.

As in previous years, priority will be given to areas where there have  been
cholera outbreaks. Contrary to the allegations  of  those  who  allege  that
cholera has been caused by water pricing and cut-offs, and there are  people
of that kind in this country, unfortunately from academic institutions,  and
many from abroad, it is clear that cholera occurs generally through the  wet
and warmer areas of our country and in poor communities  which  do  not  yet
have the basic water  and  sanitation  services  or  good  hygiene  practice
knowledge. That is why we focus so much on health education. We are  working
as a team with my department leading and supporting health  education,  DPLG
and housing.

Thus, Treasury has allocated R40 million  for  clinic  sanitation  and  R150
million for school sanitation projects. The national  sanitation  task  team
is helping to prioritise needy schools  with  local  integrated  development
planning processes.  In  addition  to  addressing  the  original  sanitation
backlog, the department is facilitating  the  eradication  of  the  despised
bucket system, currently used in nearly 500 000 households.

This year R62 million will be allocated as follows: Free State R23  million,
that is the province which has 25% of households  with  the  bucket  system;
Northern Cape R10 million; North West 9 million;  Eastern  Cape  8  million;
Gauteng 6 million and smaller amounts for  other  provinces  with  very  few
households with a bucket in place.

With the sterling support of the Premiers and MEC's concerned, I am sure  we
will achieve our target date of 2006 for eradicating the buckets.  In  fact,
if the Premiers and the provinces come to the party and add to  it,  we  can
eradicate these things sooner. The Premier of Gauteng told me he  was  going
to add to the funds that I had put there. The Free State and  Northern  Cape
together have nearly 40% of households with a bucket system in the  country.
The Premiers of these provinces are  on  a  crusade  to  end  this  despised
system.

Sanitation is closely linked to pollution control,  the  protection  of  our
precious water resource and the quality of  our  water.  Although  provinces
have  concurrent  responsibility  for  the  environment,  my  department  is
responsible for water  quality  management,  since  rivers  do  not  respect
provincial or even country  boundaries.  However,  pollution  often  results
from activities over which provinces have mandates,  such  as,  urban  waste
water, for which local governments are indeed responsible.

While local governments usually understand the cost of water used  to  flush
the toilets, they often do not consider the expensive business  of  treating
and exposing that waste that goes down the tubes, soon to  be  forgotten  by
us. This often costs more than providing clean water, and must be  paid  for
by local government and the users themselves, since flush toilets involve  a
higher level of service than national Government  currently  subsidises.  We
subsidise the ventilated improved pit latrines in the rural areas,  and  the
municipal infrastructure  grant  system  subsidises  toilets  in  the  urban
areas.

If waste water is not properly managed, we will continue to  face  problems,
such as those which recently arose at  Hartebeespoort  Dam  where  nutrients
from waste water feed troublesome, smelly algae  particularly  in  hot,  dry
weather. To remedy the problem, we must  not  just  look  at  Johannesburg's
treatment works, but also at fertiliser pollution from farms, golf  courses,
septic  tanks  of  local  households  and  waste  water  from   high-density
settlements, which is only  one  element  in  the  equation.  Investment  in
sanitation in areas such as Alexandra and Diepsloot in Gauteng may  well  be
the best way to improve water quality in urban  rivers,  and  I  am  working
with the relevant departments to encourage a solution.

We must also ensure that water users  do  not  take  more  than  their  fair
share, particularly in years of drought. Last year I  warned  that  we  were
monitoring illegal water use, using data from  that  Eye  in  the  Sky.  The
department has begun legal processes against such  people.  Directives  have
been issued, which will be followed by prosecutions where  unlawful  actions
are not stopped. I am pleased to say  that  many  water  users  cease  their
illegal activities the moment we confront them with satellite evidence.

The current drought in some areas highlights the need for discipline in  the
use of  water  and  control  which  must  go  hand  in  hand  with  improved
management,  particularly  at  municipal  level.  This  is   why   we   have
transferred  the  responsibility  for  agricultural  scheme  operation   and
maintenance to what are  now  called  water  user  associations,  previously
irrigation boards.

However,  the  process  of  transforming  these  associations  reflects  the
challenges facing the rural  communities.  Current  water  users  are  still
largely white commercial farmers, although the associations can now  include
representatives from local government and black farmers as a result  of  the
change from boards to water user associations. We encourage water  users  to
take over scheme management, but this must be done in a  way  that  reflects
the values of the new South Africa.

I will certainly not, and none of us can, tolerate a continuation  of  human
rights abuses from our apartheid past in any organisation, and  I  will  not
allow that in one for which I am responsible.  I  must  confide  in  members
that I have recently been shocked at allegations which have  surfaced  about
certain people's behaviour, and I will be dealing with this in the  National
Assembly on Friday.
Accordingly, I have instructed my Director-General  to  ensure  disciplinary
hearings take place where these infringements occurred,  and  to  strengthen
departmental oversight of the water user associations to ensure  that  their
human resources  and  procurement  policies  are  in  line  with  government
policy.

The  national  water  policy  commits  government  to  ensure   that   water
management helps to right the inequalities of the past  and  contributes  to
economic and social development. Since  farming  uses  the  most  water,  we
continue to  seek  ways  to  promote  equity  and  economic  development  in
agriculture.

Since 1998 the department has  provided  financial  assistance  to  emerging
farmers, with capital subsidies of R4,47 million  given  for  over  800  new
small-scale farmers and to an  additional  500  women  in  respect  of  food
gardens.

New farmers need support  and  guidance,  and  commercial  farmers  who  are
already organised to manage water are often more than willing to assist.  An
example of what can be done comes from the Impala  Water  User  Association,
which is working with community groups and traditional organisations in  the
Pongola and Hlobane areas of KwaZulu-Natal, using water from the new  Bivane
Dam.

There are now over 60 black farmers growing sugar in the area, and in  their
first season they sold R9  million's  worth.  That  is  empowerment  through
water development. The income was shared through the creation of  200  jobs.
A further 47 farmers are due to be established, and the  area  for  emerging
farmers  has  expanded  to  1  200  hectares.  The  dam  made  expansion  of
commercial farming possible,  creating  a  further  700  jobs,  as  well  as
supplying a water scheme that serves 50 000 people in surrounding  villages.
This is really a wonderful example of partnership in the new  South  Africa,
of established farmers, of  emerging  farmers  and  of  communities,  and  I
commend many such farmers  throughout  the  country,  from  Ceres  to  Blyde
River, and including Pongola.

This is the kind of investment we need to  empower  our  people  and  create
jobs, and we aim to help 500 farmers annually. I  am  interacting  with  the
Minister  of  Agriculture  to  ensure  that  our  support  is  part  of  the
Government's overall farming package.

All over the country groups of poor unemployed people,  mainly  women,  have
come together to grow vegetables on small plots of land to provide food  for
their families, and a little income that can produce  for  extras.  In  some
areas, I hear that they are being discouraged by agricultural officials  who
tell them that they cannot take water from streams or  boreholes  for  their
gardens. This is not true! The  National  Water  Act  says  that  water  for
domestic gardens can be taken without a licence, except  when  there  is  an
acute shortage. Certainly, no one  using  a  hand-driven  pump  or  carrying
water in buckets need be concerned. The  law  is  there  to  prevent  a  few
people from gaining control over the nation's precious  water  and  to  stop
them from preventing others to feed their families.

The restructuring of the department's plantation forests has continued.  You
have heard a reply to a question today from my hon colleague,  the  Minister
of  Public  Enterprise,  on  this  issue.  The  large  plantations,  as   he
indicated, have either been transferred to new  operators,  or  incorporated
into Safcol until Safcol's disposal is finalised.

The structuring is bearing fruit, as Minister Radebe pointed  out.  We  were
delighted to learn again that Mondi is investing R2 billion  to  expand  its
mill in Richards Bay to export an additional R500 million's  worth  of  pulp
per year. R800 million of the investment will  be  spent  in  South  Africa,
benefiting local  business  and  their  employees;  and  Mondi  will  expand
procurement for black-owned businesses.

Much of the timber will come  from  Siyaqhubekha  Forests,  the  empowerment
company which took over the management of the forests around Richards Bay.

I want to see similar developments in the Eastern Cape. It is  the  area  in
the  country  where  we  have  the  most  significant  potential  to  expand
forestry. Sixty thousand hectares of new forests could  be  added  over  the
next 20 years, creating 3 000  direct  jobs,  bringing  development  to  the
rural poor and alleviating poverty. Industry believes that  new  plantations
would allow further expansion of processing facilities in the province.

We can ensure that benefits are equitably shared with the communities  whose
land will be used for growing trees, as we are doing in the Singisi area  of
the Eastern Cape where, after forestry restructuring, there  is  already  in
just under two years R25,6 million of rental  income  awaiting  distribution
to the communities. Because  so  much  money  is  involved,  the  legitimate
landowners need to be identified through  a  thorough  land  claims  process
which is underway. We are working closely with the land authorities and,  of
course, the eminent Minister  of  Agriculture,  who  was  here  earlier,  to
finalise this. Meanwhile, the Singalanga Trust  which  owns  shares  in  the
Singisi operating company, is receiving dividend payments.

My special adviser, Prof Dennis Goldberg, who is  with  us  today,  has  met
with industry stakeholders, political leaders and the affected  communities,
and found keen interest in forestry as a vehicle for  economic  development.
Turning this potential into a  reality  will  be  a  high  priority  for  my
department.

There  has  also  been  progress  in  the  conservation  of  our   country's
indigenous forests which provide fuel, building materials,  food  and  muti.
The gathering and sale of  these  forest  products  generate  much  informal
employment. We continue to work with communities to protect the forests  and
the livelihoods  provided.  The  participatory  forest  management  approach
involves stakeholders in decision-making  regarding  forests,  and  we  have
forums in which communities participate.  We  have  completed  a  number  of
economic  feasibility  studies  around  selected  forests,   and   we   have
identified projects.

This is a tough job, as we know from  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Dukuduku
Forest, but we have seen good progress in  other  areas  with  the  imminent
transfer of the Knysna indigenous forests into  an  expanding  Garden  Route
National Park. I am also in discussions with the Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and the Eastern Cape government, and I hope  that  we  will  shortly
announce plans for the wonderful indigenous forests  of  Pondoland  and  the
establishment of the Pondoland National Park.

The Working for Water Programme of the department also supports  the  nature
conservation responsibilities of provinces. Last year the programme  cleared
more than 230 000 hectares, and did a follow-up on over  460  000  hectares.
The 305 projects created approximately 14 000 person  years  of  employment,
and we plan to do as much again this year.

The future of Working for Water is being reviewed  with  National  Treasury,
considering how such poverty relief programmes should be funded  in  future.
I believe that Working for Water has an excellent track  record  of  poverty
alleviation in those parts of the country where  alien  vegetation  poses  a
particular challenge.
In conclusion, we have made  much  progress,  but  clearly  there  are  many
challenges, and much remain to be done. Nonetheless, I have noted  -  and  I
am disturbed by this, as a South African, like all of you I am  a  patriotic
South African - that some critics of our Government, and I am talking  about
those external to Parliament, in fact, people who are in a sense,  anti  the
parliamentary process, who claim to be the great democrats of this  country,
and who have found it necessary to  invent  statistics  to,  quite  clearly,
incite people in informal settlements, people who do not yet have  services.
They have gone to the extent of  coming  up  with  fictitious  claims  about
nondelivery.

I am referring here particularly to  water  service  delivery,  and  to  the
outbreak of cholera in some areas. I am talking  about  the  claim  by  such
elements that we have privatised water in this country. I  am  going  to  go
into detail on this in the Assembly on Friday. This is a shame,  because  we
have so much to be proud  of  in  terms  of  what  we  do  as  South  Africa
incorporated in terms of our achievements, and yet there  is  a  coterie  of
people who pose as radicals and revolutionaries, but who totally  undermine,
and distort those facts, and I will expose them on Friday in  the  Assembly,
given that my precious time, like precious water, is up at  this  particular
point in time.

Let me conclude by thanking my Director-General, Mr  Mike  Muller,  and  his
able team from the water resource and service sanitation area  and  forestry
who are with us today, as well as Dennis Goldberg, for  all  the  hard  work
and commitment they  have  shown  to  ensure  that  our  water  and  forests
contribute to a better life for all. My thanks to  the  Premiers,  the  MECs
and hon members for your support.  Siyabonga  kakhulu.  Enkosi.  [Thank  you
very much.] [Applause.]

The South African Constitution establishes the principle  of  human  dignity
for all the citizens of the country. To give effect to this  principle,  the
Constitution provides various socioeconomic rights, including the  right  to
access sufficient food and water. In  addition,  the  Constitution  requires
from the state to take  reasonable  legislative  and  other  steps  to  give
effect to these rights.

In order  to  attain  the  principles  outlined  in  the  Constitution,  the
Department of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  has  made  great  advances  in
attempting to ensure that the right of access to  water  is  attainable  for
all the citizens of South Africa. This speech will provide  an  overview  of
the functions of the  department,  and  thereafter  focus  on  some  of  the
programmes and projects undertaken by the Department of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry.

The Department of  Water  and  Forestry,  DWAF,  is  responsible  for  three
functional areas, namely water  resources  management,  water  services  and
forestry. In managing its three functional areas, the aim of the  department
is to ensure the availability and supply of water at  a  national  level  to
ensure the equitable and efficient provision  of  water  services  at  local
level, and to promote sustainable forest management.

When South Africa's first nonracial  democratic  Government  took  power  in
April 1994,  the  country's  population  was  just  over  40  million.  Some
15,2Â million people, of whom 12 million lived in rural areas, lacked  access
to basic water supply, and 20,5 million lacked basic sanitation.

Prior to 1994 there was no single national government responsible for  water
supply and sanitation in South Africa.  Responsibility  was  fragmented  and
allocated to local governments in the previous  four  provinces  and  to  10
nominally autonomous  homelands,  resulting  in  very  different  levels  of
service. Most of the then white local governments  offered  standards  equal
to those in industrialised countries.

In the rural areas there were often  no  services,  whilst  in  black  urban
areas the situation was mixed. Both  urban  and  rural  services  for  black
people were often in a state of disrepair. This  situation  was  exacerbated
by the absence of any coherent national  policies,  guidelines,  or  support
structures. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry  focused  on  water
resources and forestry management.

In 1994 the new Government made  DWAF  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all
South Africans have equitable access to  water  supply  and  sanitation.  To
this end, DWAF initiated programmes and projects to fast-track  services  to
the disadvantaged populations of South Africa. DWAF  consulted  a  range  of
interested parties, and produced a policy White  Paper  on  community  water
supply and sanitation in November 1994.

This policy provided the  foundation  for  the  legislative  and  regulatory
framework enacted in the Water Service Act of 1997 which governs  the  water
sector; and for the national programme to address the backlog of  water  and
sanitation  services  for  those  who  had  been  previously  excluded  from
services in the past, especially the rural poor.

According to the Water and Sanitation Programme, Africa region:


  South Africa is one of the few  countries  in  the  world  that  formally
  recognises water as a human right.  Its  national  water  and  sanitation
  programme, which is one of the largest  national  programmes  in  Africa,
  aims to deliver sustainably on that right.


  Both the recognition of water as a human right and the development of the
  national water and sanitation programme derive from the advent, in  1994,
  of South Africa's democratic era. At the time the country  faced  immense
  challenges relating to water supply and sanitation.  The  Government  and
  its development partners have been determined to tackle  those  problems,
  and to achieve major progress in  water  and  sanitation  as  quickly  as
  possible.

In the next few pages, I shall outline some of the programmes  and  projects
that have been undertaken by DWAF  to  achieve  the  vision  for  the  South
African society encapsulated in the aim of the  RDP  to  provide  peace  and
security for all, build the nation, link reconstruction and development  and
deepen democracy.

Clean water and sanitation  are  essential  for  water  reduction,  economic
development and food security. The  progress  by  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry can be briefly summarised as follows:

Firstly, since 1994 basic water  has  been  supplied  to  almost  11Â million
people, about 80% by DWAF. Secondly, 26,8 million South  Africans  now  have
access to free basic water. At least 12Â million of  these  are  poor  people
who would otherwise have been unable to  afford  a  basic  supply  of  clean
water.

Thirdly, over 133 000 households have received sanitation. If one  considers
that 65 000 of these were in the past year alone, then the tempo is  clearly
increasing. Fourthly, by 2008 the entire  water  supply  backlog  will  have
been eradicated and by 2010 that of sanitation. As the  Minister  has  said,
this means that South Africa will not only have met  the  millennium  target
of wiping out 50% of the backlog by 2015, but the entire backlog.

An important aspect of  Government  policy  is  its  strategy  to  alleviate
poverty in South Africa. For this purpose a  policy  for  the  provision  of
free basic services has been established, of  which  water  is  one  of  the
essential services. During 2001 a policy  for  free  basic  water  has  been
developed and implemented.

The Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry announced in February  2001  that
Cabinet approved a policy to provide a basic supply of water free of  charge
to poor households. Although there  is  broader  policy  commitment  to  the
extension of free basic services to all households, the  primary  target  of
the free basic water policy is poor households.

The free basic water policy is viewed as an important  means  through  which
Government can give effect  to  its  commitment  to  improve  the  lives  of
ordinary South Africans, and especially of the poor. It is  considered  that
this policy will also result in various other benefits.

Firstly, it can improve individual and community  health  through  providing
access to a basic and clean water supply. Secondly, it  can  promote  gender
equality through reducing the burden on women to provide in the basic  water
needs for the household.

In order to facilitate the implementation of the free  basic  water  policy,
the basic levels of water supply has been determined as  6  000  litres  per
household per month. This level is based on the World Health  Organisation's
standard of 25 litres per person per day,  which  amounts  to  about  6  000
litres per month for a household of eight people.

However, the 6 000 per month only serves as a guide, and  local  authorities
still have some discretion over the amount to be allocated as a basic  level
of water supply. We are grateful that  there  are  municipalities  that  are
really providing this free water, and there are other  municipalities  which
are not, which should be urged to do so.
Working for Water was launched in 1995 in an effort to  tackle  the  problem
of invading  alien  plants  and  unemployment.  It  is  a  multidepartmental
initiative led  by  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry,  the
Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  and  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs. With 300 projects throughout the country,  the
programme aims to enhance  water  security,  improve  ecological  integrity,
restore the  productive  potential  of  land,  promote  sustainable  use  of
natural resources, and invest in the most marginalised sectors of the  South
African society.

The Working for Water programme  will  sustainably  control  invading  alien
species and optimise potential use of natural resources through the  process
of economic empowerment and transformation. In  doing  this,  the  programme
will leave a legacy of social  equity  and  legislative,  institutional  and
technical capacity.

Regarding the transfer of water services schemes, DWAF is in the process  of
restructuring ... [Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Nkk B N DLULANE: Enkosi  Mhlalingaphambili.  Mhlalingaphambili,  mandithathe

Ndize  ke  ngoku  kule  nto  ndiyithunyiweyo.   (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B N  DLULANE:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  I  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to tender an apology for the hon MEC of the  Eastern  Cape.  Due
to circumstances beyond his control, he  could  not  be  here  to  speak  on
behalf of the province. I, therefore, rise to speak on his behalf.

Firstly, I would like to  greet  everybody  in  this  House.  I  greet  you,
Chairperson, the hon Minister and hon members in general. We  will  be  glad
if what the hon Minister just spoke about succeeded and afforded the  people
of the Eastern Cape  an  opportunity  to  benefit  from  this,  because  his
programme on forestry will certainly drive away hunger  and  poverty  there.
Then what is always said by the ANC,  particularly  by  its  hon  President,
namely that forests will be the gold of the Eastern Cape province,  will  be
fulfilled. I will now proceed with what I have been asked to do.]

Providing water in the rural areas of the Eastern  Cape  is  proving  to  be
very challenging. Due to the topography of the rural  areas  in  the  former
Transkei, you would typically  find  small  villages  on  the  top  of  high
ridges, with the rivers or streams miles down  below.  This  makes  it  very
expensive to provide adequate potable water  to  the  households.  Both  the
capital, as well as the operation  and  maintenance  costs  are  very  high.
Aspects that increase the cost of providing water can  also  be  contributed
to the size of  the  plots  in  rural  areas,  the  inaccessibility  of  the
terrain,  lack  of  access  roads,  long  distances  of  pipelines  and  the
distances material suppliers have to transport the materials.

The most typical source of water would be the rivers or streams, and  a  big
percentage of projects would be boreholes.  It  appears  that  alternatives,
such as harvesting rain water and storing  it  in  tanks,  do  not  get  the
necessary attention due to cost or possible unreliability.  More  innovative
ideas such as harvesting the mist should be more actively pursued. Only  12%
reduction in backlogs has been achieved with  an  estimated  500  000  rural
households still without adequate water.

In the Eastern Cape the national Department of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry
(DWAF),  the  provincial  department  of  housing,  local   government   and
traditional  affairs  and  district  municipalities  are   working   closely
together in service delivery.  For  instance,  on  a  number  of  water  and
sanitation projects, a  close  working  relationship  was  forged  by  using
funding provided by both DWAF and the Consolidated Municipal  Infrastructure
Programme (CMIP) on projects. The DWAF  funds  are  being  used  for  social
development, whilst CMIP funds  are  used  for  implementation,  the  reason
being that the DWAF funding is conducive to social development,  whilst  the
CMIP funding is not to the same extent. On the other hand,  the  funding  of
CMIP projects, such as sanitation, is more conducive to implementation  than
DWAF funded  projects.  The  combination  of  the  two  addresses  both  the
physical and social needs of a project.

The various sector plans form  an  integral  part  of  municipalities'  IDP.
There is a problem  when  an  important  sector  plan,  such  as  water  and
sanitation, is lagging behind. As far as could be determined, only  five  of
the six integrated water services development plans have  been  successfully
completed. The comprehensiveness of such plans is also questionable when  it
appears that certain important divisions within DWAF did not participate  in
the process. At a workshop in Pretoria it transpired that the Water  Quality
Division was not aware of the processes and were not  involved,  but  played
an important role in the control and monitoring  of  bulk  services.  It  is
important that the sector plans be aligned with the timeframes of  the  IDPs
and that the various plans be revised at the same time.

Under the powers and functions, all district municipalities in  the  Eastern
Cape, except Cacadu, is the Water Services Authority (WSA). It is  important
that rural representation be present in the training  aspects,  as  well  as
all other aspects pertaining to water  and  sanitation  that  will  have  an
impact on them. The role of water  boards  will  need  to  be  relooked  at.
Within  the  Amatola  District  Municipality,  the  DM   as   Buffalo   City
Municipality is a WSA. The Amatola Water Board is  also  operating  in  both
areas. This not only duplicates certain functions, but leads to an  increase
of cost for the end user. The issue  becomes  more  complex  since  DWAF  is
still the owner of some of the bulk services  with  an  agreement  with  the
Water Board, but the DM or Buffalo City is the WSA.

It is important to protect water resources from exploitation and  pollution.
Certain boreholes had to be abandoned due to pollution from nearby  sewerage
treatment works. In  some  instances  finding  sufficient  ground  water  is
difficult,  and  pollution  of  such  resources  cannot  be  tolerated.  The
pollution of surface water increases the  possible  occurrence  of  diseases
such as cholera. In the more arid western  and  northwestern  areas  in  the
province, conservation of water  is  important.  Innovative  solutions  will
have to be found as alternatives for water-borne sanitation.

Sanitation is one of the most underrated services that are provided  to  all
in South Africa. Expenditure on sanitation is  a  small  percentage  of  the
total funding  allocation.  The  expenditure  in  terms  of  the  number  of
households served should be the same as that for  water  services.  The  one
service should not be provided in the absence  of  the  other.  One  of  the
reasons why sanitation lagged behind the provision  of  water  services  was
the nonalignment between various programmes providing the same services.  It
is trusted that with the changes in the criteria of providing sanitation  by
DWAF, an increase in sanitation  projects  will  take  place.  The  province
still has a long way to go in eradicating  both  the  water  and  sanitation
backlogs. With the information  available  to  the  department,  only  a  2%
reduction in sanitation backlogs in the rural areas in the Eastern Cape  has
been achieved to date,  with  750  000  households  still  without  adequate
sanitation.

Xa siphulaphule  eyibeka  uMphathiswa  sinethemba  lokuba  iza  kwenzeka  le
mibono siyibonayo singuRhulumente. Sqinisekile naseMpuma Koloni kuya  kutsho
kube mhlophe kube hele. [Listening to what the hon  Minister  is  saying  we
have hope that the visions we have as Government will be  realised.  We  are
certain that even in the Eastern Cape things will shape up.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Madam Chair, I think that the department's purpose has  been
clearly captured in paragraph 3 of this Vote, namely  that  it  will  ensure
that effective, efficient, sustainable and affordable water  and  sanitation
services are provided to the people of South Africa.

Regarding the expenditure estimates, an expenditure outcome to the  tune  of
R7 billion has been realised by this  department  for  the  period  1999  to
2003. The Medium-Term  Expenditure  Estimate  for  2003-04  stands  at  R2,4
billion. Yet, hon Minister, hardly a few days ago when I was home  attending
a funeral, I received a message that an  area  called  Malamulele  town  had
been without water for the past month.

For the past two weeks I have been  interacting  with  communities  such  as
those of Zangoma, Petanenge, Mafarana and Sasekani and  following  up  their
problem concerning electricity reticulation.  In  the  same  villages  there
were complaints that they did not have water, and that they  had  to  go  to
the nearest boreholes and start to queue at midnight for water  which  would
be used the next day. I am not suggesting to  the  Minister  that  there  is
nothing that is being done by the department. However, there are  definitely
certain  communities  which  still   experience   desperate   water   supply
shortages.

One other observation that I  wish  to  share  with  the  Minister  is  that
another area of concern is the  existence  of  inequity  between  urban  and
rural dwellers with regard to access to sufficient  and  sustainable  water.
This imbalance calls for urgent attention.  The  elite  residents  of  towns
like Phalaborwa, Tzaneen,  Pietersburg  and  Louis  Trichardt  do  not  lack
water. Water is so plentiful that car-wash  businesses  have  mushroomed  in
those areas, let alone the watering  of  flowers  and  green  grass  in  the
yards.

Rural households struggle to put up with only 20 litres  of  water  for  all
domestic use. I have already made reference to the queues for water  at  the
boreholes which start at about midnight. The water shortage is so  acute  in
Limpompo that the situation has assumed disastrous proportions.
Last, but not least, a  word  on  sanitation:  I  would  like  to  know,  Mr
Minister,  which  section  within  DWAF  is   responsible   for   sanitation
programmes? Do we have task or health education teams in pursuance of  these
programmes? Year in and year out cholera and other  water-related  epidemics
occur during flood seasons. That suggests that no prophylactic measures  are
put in place during the quiescent period.

Poor sanitation practices are linked to our habits, practices,  beliefs  and
values. Rural communities hardly put a high premium on  the  Western  habits
of hygiene like the use of toilets and regular washing  of  hands.  Instead,
they would rather respond  fast  to  issues  of  witchcraft  and  initiation
schools. It is against  this  background  that  I  interrogate  issues  that
pertain to sanitation programmes, and how they are implemented. Thank you.

Mr M M MACKENZIE (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, hon Minister, I am  going  to
thank you in isiZulu, Minister.

Ngiyayincoma inkulumo yakho nomsebenzi owenziwa  umnyango  wakho.  Ungadinwa
nangomuso ndoda. [Ubuwelewele.] [I commend your speech and the work that  is
being done by your department. May you  carry  on  like  that,  fellow  man.
[Interjections.]]

I must also apologise to you for having  to  represent  the  pretty  Belinda
whom I believe you were looking forward to seeing - but we heard it  through
the grapevine.

The  Water  Act,  in  its  fullest  sense,  is  a  most  advanced  piece  of
legislation  that  covers  this  vital   natural   resource.   It   is   the
implementation of the Act which is giving rise  to  some  concerns,  as  the
habitual users of water in most cases, whether directly  for  irrigation  or
indirectly for crops such as forests and sugar  cane,  continue  with  water
usage, and not yet pay the full price for it.

It is assumed that the Department of Water Affairs is applying  the  Act  in
terms of a predetermined set of criteria with the  most  fragile  catchments
receiving first attention. It is  suggested,  in  all  humility,  that  more
dissemination  of  information,  particularly  to  rural   communities,   is
required in order to dispel the myths that fly  around  and  could  threaten
future initiatives. In particular, the impact of  rural  community  forestry
on stream flows and the need therefore to measure  those  for  the  sake  of
parity require ongoing attention. With the advent of more rural  agriculture
being  established,  the  emphasis  on  water  for  successful  cropping  is
growing, and the cost of this water needs to  be  factored  into  the  gross
margins that are anticipated.

Regarding forestry, the rate  of  entry  into  commercial  forestry  by  new
foresters is still very slow. This can be put down squarely to the  rotation
length and the absence of income until exploitation  occurs.  Schemes  exist
where payments are made on calculated MAIs  each  year,  but  these  require
intensive administration. It is  requested  that  the  department  considers
looking into some system that will supply an income  on  an  interim  basis,
particularly for the first crop and before maturity.  Interaction  with  the
main processors of fibre is essential in arriving at a workable solution.

The woodlot system prevalent in traditional areas has  been  under  scrutiny
for some time, as this is the obvious dodging of the planting permit  system
for an area too small to qualify. It has resulted in  marginal  areas  being
used for forestry, and of course has resulted in negative impact  on  stream
flows. The economics of woodlot forestry are questionable for the grower  as
the predation on the crop from a multitude of predators  frequently  results
in the crop returning a pittance compared to the anticipated income  claimed
by the processor prior to planting.

It is strongly recommended that rural forestry should  be  encouraged  along
the lines of block planting in areas that can sustain an  economical  return
and where the forest is owned by the community on a co-operative  basis  and
linked to an ongoing  mentorship  programme  in  order  to  avoid  the  many
pitfalls which are encountered by beginner growers. Training in  the  basics
of silviculture is essential. It is suggested that short courses be  offered
by the department, acting in concert  with  the  universities  and  forestry
colleges. Again, the private sector should be inspanned to  contribute  with
practical training, as it is in  their  interests  to  encourage  a  quality
supply of raw material for their processing plants.

I will cast a spell of nightmares on you. [Laughter.]]

There are new sources of fibre  that  are  now  being  introduced  into  the
growing market. They grow quickly and they come in the  form  of  quina  and
the benign form of cannabis known as hemp.

Akuyona insangu leyo kodwa isitshalo esihlobene nayo insangu. [That  is  not
dagga, but a plant that is related to dagga.]

These crops require  far  less  critical  growing  conditions  for  economic
success,  as  their  water  requirements  are  far  less.  They  also   lend
themselves to outgrower schemes where the rural land user can,  with  little
difficulty, produce a crop that will enhance family income, and at the  same
time not be vulnerable to livestock damage except, of course,  goats,  which
we all know will  eat  anything  from  plastic  to  ladies'  underwear.  The
markets for this crop exist. BMW and Mercedes need the fibre  -  and  listen
to this carefully - ``to  construct  biodegradable  dashboards'',  for  what
reason I don't know. However, as long as there is a market, it is  fine.  It
is considered essential that these fibre crops be encouraged.

To reiterate, I request this active department, and I do it in humility,  to
hold information sessions with rural water users, and educate  them  on  the
aims and objectives of the Act, which are not punitive,  but  are  essential
to the conservation of our  water.  To  encourage  the  entry  of  new  tree
growers into the industry ... [Time expired.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Hon Chairperson, Mr Mackenzie always  makes  me  jealous
with his isiZulu. However, I am going to copy him today and not  only  thank
the Minister, but deliver my whole presentation,  not  in  isiZulu,  but  in
Afrikaans. [Interjections.]

Die  voorsiening  van  dienste,  en  veral  watervoorsiening,   onder   baie
gemeenskappe, en veral op die platteland, was van die begin van 1994 af  een
van die hoogste prioriteite wat deur  die  nuwe  Regering  aangespreek  moes
word. Ek kan goed onthou dat in 1994,  toe  die  Witskrif  hier  in  die  ou
Senaat bekendgestel is, het al die senatore van al die  opposisiepartye  dit
eenparig gesteun, selfs diÃ© van die DP.  Hulle  het  eers  later  begin  met
hulle ``fight back"-benadering. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die  agb  lid  hierso  het
moeilikheid met die woord ``shame''. Miskien moet 'n mens ``shame''  inbring
saam met hulle ``fight back"-benadering. [Gelag.] (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Since  the  beginning  of  1994,  the  provision  of  services,  and  water
provision in  particular,  in  many  communities,  and  in  rural  areas  in
particular, was one of the highest priorities which had to be  addressed  by
the new Government. I can well remember that in 1994, when the  White  Paper
was introduced here in the  old  Senate,  all  the  senators  from  all  the
opposition parties supported it unanimously, even those from  the  DP.  They
only began their ``fight back'' approach  later.  [Interjections.]  The  hon
member here has trouble with the word ``shame''. Perhaps one should  include
``shame'' with their ``fight back'' approach. [Laughter.] It is a shame.

Hierdie ideaal word goed aangespreek, en moet in stand  gehou  en  uitgebrei
word, want daar is nog steeds ongeveer ses miljoen  mense  sonder  skoon  en
veilige  water,  en  plus  minus  16  miljoen  wat  nog  wag  vir  voldoende
sanitasie. Dit is egter  nie  so  eenvoudig  nie,  want  Suid-Afrika  is  'n
waterarm land. Ons het nie 'n voldoende waterbesparingskultuur  nie.  Ongeag
al die veldtogte, mors mense nog water by  hul  huise,  en  word  die  beste
praktyke nie oral in die landbou en nywerheid toegepas nie.

Nog  'n  uitdaging  vir  die  departement  is  die  invloei  van   onwettige
immigrante wat ook nie sonder hierdie  basiese  dienste  kan  klaarkom  nie.
Daar word al van ses miljoen gepraat. Verder trek  gemeenskappe  agter  werk
aan, en die  noodwendige  vestiging  van  nuwe  nedersettings  skep  verdere
uitdagings en plaas druk op die verskillende bronne van die departement.

Om die  meeste  water  te  lewer,  moet  die  waterleweringsgebied  in  elke
stroomgebied so goed as moontlik beskerm word deur  baie  streng  reÃ«ls  oor
bebossing. Ek is nie seker of die huidige reÃ«ls streng genoeg is nie, en  of
dit streng genoeg en doeltreffend  genoeg  toegepas  word  nie.  Hierna  sal
gekyk moet word.

Indien die omgewing na behore beskerm word, sal ons  meer  water  hÃª,  asook
minder erosie en stadiger  toeslikking  van  ons  damme.  Die  probleem  van
indringerplante en van bome wat te naby aan riviere geplant is en in  sekere
gebiede watervloei drasties benadeel, is nog nie oral opgelos nie. Die  Werk
vir Water-projek was 'n goeie gedagte waarop innoverend gebou moet word.

In   die   Noord-Kaap   word    voorheen    benadeelde    gemeenskappe    by
besproeiingskemas  in  die   Oranjerivier   betrek,   byvoorbeeld   by   die
Congregational-kerkgronde, 282 hektaar; by Pella, 745 hektaar; by  Sanddrif,
450  hektaar  en  'n  verdere  1Â 000  hektaar  sal  geadverteer   word   vir
vennootskappe tussen kommersiÃ«le en  opkomende  boere.  Die  water  van  die
Oranje-  en  die  Vaalrivier  is  die  Noord-Kaap  se  lewensaar,  en   bied
geleenthede vir volhoudbare vestiging van nuwe boere, mits insetkostes  soos
watertariewe, grondbelasting, lone,  diesel  en  arbeidswette  dit  nie  vir
almal tÃ© moeilik maak nie.

Die provinsie het R10 miljoen opsy gesit vir 2003-04 om die  watertekort  in
die Karoostreek aan te spreek, en verlede jaar  in  hierdie  debat  is  daar
gewys op die probleme wat ons in die De Aar-streek met water het, en ek  sal
graag van die Minister wil weet of daar al planne is om dit aan te spreek.

Waternavorsing oor die impak en beleid  ten  opsigte  van  akwakultuur  moet
versnel word. Ons versoek die departement om 'n leidende  rol  te  speel  om
afgevaardigdes van die Departemente van Omgewingsake en Toerisme en  Landbou
en Grondsake in 'n werkgroep saam te kry  om  oor  beleid  en  'n  versnelde
werkwyse te besin. Akwakultuur is 'n eeu-oue  sektor  in  talle  wÃªrelddele,
maar in Afrika en  in  Suid-Afrika  het  dit  tot  dusver  'n  minimale  rol
gespeel.

Navorsing, gemeenskaps- en vryemarkbelangstelling,  en  die  potensiaal  van
die industrie dui duidelik daarop dat daar 'n vinnige  ontwikkeling  op  die
gebied op ons wag. Ons kan leiers in Afrika wees, maar  dan  moet  deur  die
genoemde  departemente  saamgewerk  word.   Daar   moet   redes   deur   die
departemente  gevind  word  om  die  ontwikkeling  van  akwakultuur  as   'n
industrie aan te moedig, eerder as om administratiewe rompslomp en ou  denke
te gebruik om dit juis te kniehalter, en dit is wat op die oomblik  aan  die
gang is.

Dit is egter jammer dat die agb Minister nie hierdie Huis goed  genoeg  geag
het om die groot aankondiging wat hy Vrydag in  die  ander  plek  wil  doen,
hier te doen nie. Indien hy dit hier sou gedoen het, sou  sy  boodskap  byna
oornag by die mense op grondvlak uitgekom het. Dis waaroor ons hier  is,  en
sou hy nie vir die media hoef te gewag het nie.

Water, ``amanzi'', ``metsi'' is in Suid-Afrika nie volop nie, en tog ag  ons
dit nie as kosbaar genoeg nie. Die agb Minister en sy departement maak  goed
gebruik van bestaande infrastruktuur, en  hy  skep  nuwe  infrastruktuur  en
wend dit aan tot voordeel van almal in Suid-Afrika op so  'n  wyse  dat  dit
ook beskikbaar sal wees vir ons kinders wie se plek ons  net  leen.  Dankie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This ideal is being addressed well, and must be  maintained  and  expanded,
because there are still approximately six million people without  clean  and
safe water, and approximately 16 million who are still waiting for  adequate
sanitation. However, it is not that simple, because South Africa is an  arid
country. We do not have an adequate water-saving culture.  Despite  all  the
campaigns, people still waste water in their homes,  and  best  practice  is
not implemented everywhere in agriculture and industry.

Another challenge for the department is the  influx  of  illegal  immigrants
who also cannot do without these  basic  services.  There  is  talk  of  six
million already. In addition, communities move to follow job  opportunities,
and  the  necessary  establishment  of  new  settlements   creates   further
challenges and puts pressure on the various resources of the department.

To deliver the most water, the water supply  area  in  each  catchment  area
must  be  protected  as  well  as  possible  by  very  strict  rules   about
afforestation. I am not sure if the current rules are strict enough, and  if
they are being implemented strictly and efficiently enough. This  will  have
to be looked at.

If the environment is properly protected, we will have more water,  as  well
as less erosion and slower silting up of our  dams.  The  problem  of  alien
vegetation and of trees which are planted too close  to  rivers,  and  which
drastically reduce  water  flow  in  certain  areas,  has  not  been  solved
everywhere. The Working for Water Project was a good  thought  on  which  we
must build in an innovative way.

In the Northern  Cape  previously  disadvantaged  communities  are  becoming
involved in irrigation schemes on the  Orange  River,  for  example  at  the
Congregational Church ground, 282  hectares;  at  Pella,  745  hectares;  at
Sanddrif, 450 hectares, and a further 1 000 hectares will be advertised  for
partnerships between commercial and emerging farmers.  The  water  from  the
Orange and the Vaal Rivers is  the  lifeblood  of  the  Northern  Cape,  and
offers opportunities for sustainable establishment of new farmers,  provided
that start-up costs like water tariffs, land tax, loans, diesel  and  labour
laws do not make it too difficult for everyone.

The province has set aside R10 million for  2003-04  to  address  the  water
shortage in the Karoo district, and in this debate last  year  the  problems
we have with water in the De Aar district were  pointed  out,  and  I  would
like to know from the Minister whether there are plans to address this.

Water research on the impact and policy with regard to aquaculture  must  be
expedited. We  request  the  department  to  take  a  leading  role  to  get
delegates from the Departments of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  and
Agriculture and Land Affairs together in a working group to deliberate on  a
policy and an accelerated working method.  Aquaculture  is  a  centuries-old
sector in many parts of the world, but in Africa and in South Africa it  has
thus far played a minimal role.

Research, community and free market  interest,  and  the  potential  of  the
industry very clearly indicate that a rapid development in this area  awaits
us. We can be leaders in Africa, but  then  the  aforementioned  departments
must work together. The departments  must  find  reasons  to  encourage  the
development of aquaculture as an industry, rather than using  administrative
red rape and old thinking to hamper  it,  and  that  is  precisely  what  is
happening at the moment.

However, it is a pity that the hon Minister  did  not  consider  this  House
good enough to make the important announcement  he  wants  to  make  in  the
other place on Friday, here. If he had done it here, his message could  have
reached the people on the ground overnight. That is what we  are  here  for,
and he would not have to wait for the media.

Water, ``amanzi'', ``metsi'' is not abundant in South Africa, and yet we  do
not value it enough.

The  hon  Minister  and  his  department   make   good   use   of   existing
infrastructure, and he creates new infrastructure and  utilises  it  to  the
benefit of all in South Africa in such a way that it will also be  available
for  our  children  whose  place  we  are  merely  borrowing.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]]

Mr  S  V  NAICKER  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Madam  Chair,  having  heard  the   hon
Minister's speech this afternoon, I must  say  that  I  am  indeed  pleased,
because this is a very emotive and a very sensitive  subject  pertaining  to
our community as a whole. He has touched on effective management,  vandalism
and on equitable share. It is an area, I would  like  the  hon  Minister  to
remember my own experience in local authority, where funding  was  given  to
local authorities for the sole purpose of  providing  water  to  the  poorer
people.

The question is, was equitable share money, intended for  water,  in  actual
fact given to the poor people? I am very pleased indeed  that  the  Minister
has allocated R278 million to KwaZulu-Natal, which is very deserving.

Water is vital  for  human  life.  Clean  water  means  health,  growth  and
prosperity. Water is a guarantee for the unlocking  of  human  economic  and
social potential, especially for rural communities and the  poorest  of  the
poor. Research by the Human Science  Research  Council  has  pinpointed  the
hurdles that are faced by  rural  communities  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  on  a
national level.

Despite the efforts of the responsible Minister, water is an  integral  part
of solid and efficient environmental  management.  Despite  the  debates  of
practitioners and researchers regarding the scarcity or not of  water  as  a
vital resource, the reality is  that  the  existing  legislation  gives  the
national department authority to control water and its allocation.

Scientific research conducted at the University of Natal and  the  HSRC  has
shown that the water projects that have involved  participation,  collective
decision-making of communities in the allocation of resources and  regarding
contractors, have been more successful than those that have  been  delivered
through a top-down approach.

The privatisation of water, on the other hand,  should  not  mean  the  poor
community and individual must have their water  supply  cut  when  there  is
unemployment and poverty, and when they cannot afford  to  pay  for  it.  In
such cases  innovative  ways  need  to  be  devised  between  the  agencies,
individuals and communities so that our people will not suffer. We  need  to
look at these realities with deep feelings of solidarity  and  understanding
for  the  poor  and  the  needy.  Provincial  and  local   authorities,   in
collaboration with the Ministry of Water Affairs and  Forestry,  must  study
comparative ways of delivering water and methods of payment, and not  burden
poor communities with penalties and cut-offs.

There has been a report that in many areas of  KwaZulu-Natal  the  allocated
free  water  is  not  delivered  to  our  communities,  and   this   serious
discrepancy needs to be  rectified.  KwaZulu-Natal  has  two  urgent  crises
apart from HIV/Aids: one is starvation and the other is  potable  water  and
proper sanitation. I am indeed pleased, as  I  have  mentioned  earlier  on,
with the remarks made by the Minister in this particular field.

In view of the fact that as recently as  the  Nepad  conference,  held  only
last  week,  where  eminent  scientists  warned  of   threatening   climatic
conditions, we need to look at some of the consequences of  emphasising  the
development of forestry in our country. As we know, because of the  prodigal
misuse of irreplaceable resources such as fossil fuels, wood  and  water  in
the First World, world climatic changes have come about.

This has resulted in famine and drought on the whole African  continent.  We
all know that although forestry is a highly profitable undertaking,  it  has
real dangers also. Firstly, the amount of  arable  land  is  eroded  by  the
planting of trees which deplete the water table in the  vicinity,  resulting
in impoverishment of surrounding farmlands. One just  has  to  look  at  the
reduction of dairy farming  in  certain  areas  of  KwaZulu-Natal,  such  as
Boston, Bulwer, Underburg, Creighton and Greytown, to name but a few.
Furthermore, these forests deplete the soil on which  they  are  growing,  a
fact which sincerely needs the  personal  attention  of  the  ministry.  The
invasion of the Dukuduku Forest, on the other hand,  indicate  clearly  that
unless the authorities act decisively,  fairly  and  adequately  on  burning
issues of land restitution, we must be ready for many  other  cases  similar
to this throughout the country, from North West to the Limpopo  and  beyond.
The dispute between the squatters and the land claims authorities  regarding
the  beautiful  national  forest  that   contains   a   massive   ecological
attraction, as was recently heard in the KwaZulu-Natal  region  land  claims
court,  pin-points  the  importance  of   consulting   cooperation   between
communities and organs of state. This is a 13  200  hectare  tract  of  land
near the beautiful St Lucia estuary where forest squatters  invaded  against
the decision of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry,  this  despite
the fact  that  a  portion  of  the  forest  had  been  designated  for  the
resettlement of the community. The people living on the  land  decided  they
would not move, as they had created  agricultural  products  for  their  own
economic survival. [Time expired.]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chair.  Contrary  to  popular  belief,  the  DA
gives credit where credit is due.  Therefore  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Minister today for keeping a promise. There are few people who  can  keep  a
promise for a year.  I  thank  the  Minister  and  his  Ministry  for  being
extremely approachable, and I also want to thank the Water Research  Council
for an excellent presentation during the past week.

Ek gaan my egter vandag op die Clanwilliamdam toespits.  Hierdie  dam  staan
vandag op 12% waterinhoud, terwyl dit 'n jaar gelede op 31% gestaan het.  In
hierdie stadium verloor die dam 1% water elke drie dae. Die afname in  water
gebeur nou baie vinnig. Indien dit nie gou  reÃ«n  nie,  gaan  daar  probleme
wees. As 'n dam op 14 November  die  vorige  jaar  nie  oorgeloop  het  nie,
bestaan die moontlikheid dat waterbesparingsmaatreÃ«ls in die  daaropvolgende
jaar toegepas gaan word. Dit het nie verlede November oorgeloop nie.
Die  afgelope  paar  jaar  was  daar  reeds  'n  20%  besparing   deur   die
Besproeiingsraad en die Departement van Waterwese. Hoewel die  landbouer  sy
volle kwota vir water moet betaal, moet die landbouer nog  steeds  weet  hoe
om sy waterkwota te rek. Die landbouer kan dus nie die volle potensiaal  van
die   plaas   benut   nie,   want   die   jaarlikse   beplanning   het    'n
persentasiebeperking in die verdampingsfaktor, asook  in  lekkasies  in  die
kanaal. VanweÃ« die ouderdom van hierdie kanaal wat  tans  in  'n  baie  swak
toestand is, gaan 30% van die watervoorraad verlore. Landbouers kry dus  nie
die volle kwota waarvoor hulle betaal nie.

As 'n mens aan watervoorsiening dink, moet 'n mens nie duur dink  nie,  maar
wel toekomsgerig. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I am going to focus on the Clanwilliam Dam today. This dam today stands  at
a 12% water content, while it stood at 31% a few years ago.  At  this  stage
the dam is losing 1% of its water every three days. The  decrease  in  water
is now taking place very fast. If it  does  not  rain  soon  there  will  be
problems. If  a  dam  did  not  run  over  the  previous  year  there  is  a
possibility  that  water  restrictions  will  be  put  into  place  in   the
subsequent year. It did not run over last November.

During the past few years there has already been a  saving  of  20%  by  the
Irrigation  Board  and  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs.  Although   the
agriculturalist must pay his  full  quota  for  water,  the  agriculturalist
should  nevertheless  know   how   to   stretch   his   water   quota.   The
agriculturalist therefore cannot utilise the  full  potential  of  the  farm
because the annual water planning contains a percentage  limitation  in  the
evaporation factor, as well as in leaks in the canal. Owing to  the  age  of
this canal, which is in a very poor state of repair at present, 30%  of  the
water supply is lost. Agriculturalists therefore do not get the  full  quota
for which they have paid.

When one thinks of water supply, one must not think  expensive,  but  rather
with a view to the future.]

The need for additional water in the Olifants River catchment area has  been
known for some time, but it was confirmed in an Olifants-Doring Basin  study
in  1998.  During  this  study  the  raising  of  the  Clanwilliam  Dam  was
identified as a potential option to make  more  water  available.  A  safety
inspection of the Clanwilliam  Dam  revealed  that  remedial  work  for  dam
safety reasons is required. Due to a chemical reaction  between  the  cement
an,d the aggregate that was used for the  dam  wall,  the  concrete  swells,
which pushes the wall in an upstream direction.

This, in turn, may compromise the anchoring cables  that  were  used  around
1956 as  part  of  the  previous  raising  of  the  dam.  The  situation  is
exacerbated by the temperature differences  that  occur  on  the  downstream
side of the wall, which faces in a northwesterly direction.

The remedial work that is proposed consists of adding a protective layer  of
concrete on the downstream side  of  the  wall  in  order  to  minimise  the
temperature differences and to add stability to  the  structure.  This  will
then reduce the movement of the dam wall to a  tolerable  level.  Adding  to
the protective layer offers the opportunity to raise the dam  wall  by  five
metres without any work to the  foundations  being  required.  The  remedial
work to the wall offers the opportunity to raise the wall at the same  time,
thereby saving costs in doing so.

Die  Sederberg-munisipaliteit   oorweeg   dit   om   munisipale   meentgrond
beskikbaar te stel aan  opkomende  boere.  Indien  addisionele  landbouwater
beskikbaar is, kan meer boere gevestig word. Grond is  beskikbaar.  Ek  haal
graag aan uit 'n dokument. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The  Cedarberg  Municipality  is  considering  making  available  municipal
common land  to  emerging  farmers.  If  additional  agricultural  water  is
available, more farmers can be established. Land is available. I would  like
to quote from a document.]

It is the study into the possible raising of the Clanwilliam Dam, which  was
conducted by BKS in February 2003. It goes:
  There is sufficient irrigable land below the Clanwilliam Dam  to  utilise
  virtually any increase in yield from the dam.

Deur die verhoging van die damwal, kan  ook  groter  buitebedding-plaasdamme
gebou word  om  watertekorte,  veral  gedurende  die  somermaande,  te  help
verlig. Die tempo waarteen landbou in die  Sandveldgebied  ontwikkel,  plaas
'n groot las  op  bestaande  waterbronne,  so  ook  die  verhoging  van  die
soutgehalte van ondergrondse water wat besig is om te styg.

In die Sandveldgebied is die grootste waterverbruik in landbou,  en  al  die
water vir landboudoeleindes word uit grondwaterbronne verkry. Die  vinnigste
groei is in die Langvlei-area waar aartappels gekweek word vir een  van  die
grootste  kitskos  konsessiegroepe  in  die  Wes-Kaap.   Groot   hoeveelhede
saadaartappels, wat van groot belang is vir die  aartappelbedryf,  word  ook
in die Sandveld geproduseer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[By increasing the dam wall, larger outer-bed farm  dams  can  be  built  to
assist with relieving water shortages, especially during the summer  months.
The pace at which agriculture is developing in the Sandveld area is  placing
a heavy burden on existing water resources, and so is the  increase  in  the
salt content of subterranean water which is rising.

In the Sandveld area one finds the highest water utilisation in  agriculture
and all the water for agricultural purposes is  obtained  from  subterranean
water resources. The fastest growth is found  in  the  Langvlei  area  where
potatoes are cultivated for one of the largest fast food franchises  in  the
Western Cape.  Large  quantities  of  seed  potatoes,  which  are  of  great
importance to the potato industry, are also produced in the Sandveld area.]

The following conclusion can be drawn: There is no  fatal  flow  that  would
prevent the raising of the Clanwilliam Dam. Secondly, there is enough  water
to support raising of the dam; thirdly, there is proven  demand  for  water;
fourthly, the benefit of additional water is far greater than  the  cost  of
raising the dam. Fifthly, the 10m raising appears to be  near  the  optimal,
but other considerations could  favour  a  higher  raising  which  is  still
economically viable. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the capital  cost
can be recovered by selling water rights at a market related price.

Why am  I  raising  the  issue  today?  A  more  detailed  study  should  be
undertaken to obtain the optimal height by which  the  dam  wall  should  be
raised. Such a study should  be  completed  as  soon  as  possible,  as  the
remedial work required for dam safety reasons at the Bulshoek  Dam  and  the
Clanwilliam Dam have to commence as soon as possible.

I trust the Minister will make the promise today  that  the  necessary  work
will start in his term of office. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S E BYNEVELDT (Western Cape): Baie dankie,  Minister,  vir  u  wonderlike
inset. Baie dankie vir u visie en vir u plan en u optrede. [Thank  you  very
much, Minister, for your wonderful input.  Thank  you  very  much  for  your
vision and for your plan and your action.]

Water is our most valuable natural resource; at the same time also  one  our
largest vulnerabilities. It is a renewable resource that belongs to all  the
people of our province, and it is therefore  our  shared  responsibility  to
ensure that we have the supply we need. Water  is  our  lifeline.  It  is  a
resource too valuable to waste and our survival depends on  it.  It  is  the
life blood of our industry, agriculture, tourism and communities.  We  must,
together, find ways of ensuring our water future.

Our provincial government is committed to building the Western Cape  into  a
world-class province which cares for all of its people, and the key to  this
is the principle of iKapa eliHlumayo  [The  developing  Cape],  growing  and
developing the Cape. Growth  and  development  requires  that  we  not  only
address the challenges of the next year or two, but that  we  actively  plan
for the challenges of the next 10 to 15 years. One of the most  visible  and
pressing of  these  challenges  is  the  impending  water  shortage  in  our
province.

Ons is dikwels gou om daarop te wys dat toegang tot  veilige  drinkwater  'n
basiese grondwetlike reg is. Dit is so, maar  ons  moenie  vergeet  dat  met
elke reg daar ook 'n verantwoordelikheid kom nie. Miskien is dit die  eerste
stap om te erken dat water nie 'n ewigdurende  hulpbron  is  nie.  Navorsing
dui daarop dat as ons sou voortgaan om water te verbruik soos  wat  ons  dit
nou verbruik, elke huishouding  in  die  Wes-Kaap  binnekort  permanente  en
streng waterbeperkings in die gesig gaan staar.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[We are often quick to point out that access to safe  drinking  water  is  a
basic constitutional right. That is so, but we must  not  forget  that  with
every right there also is a responsibility. Perhaps the  first  step  is  to
acknowledge that water is not an everlasting  resource.  Research  indicates
that if we were to continue consuming water at the  rate  at  which  we  are
consuming it at present, every household in the Western Cape would  soon  be
facing permanent and stringent water restrictions.]

The fact of the matter is that the demand for water is  ever  increasing.  A
recent migration study shows  that  the  Western  Cape  is  experiencing  an
annual influx of 48 000 new residents,  which  undoubtedly  places  enormous
pressure on the delivery of water supplies.  As  a  province  we  have  been
performing well with regard to the vision of free  basic  services.  Twenty-
two municipalities are providing a certain amount of water  free  of  charge
to all households. The remaining eight municipalities  supply  this  service
only to indigenous households. The reality is that if we run out  of  water,
we will not be able to continue with this service.

On the surface there would appear to be little  cause  for  alarm.  Although
there are already water  shortages  in  some  catchment  areas,  on  average
supply and demand in the Western Cape seem to be in balance. There are  even
opportunities for increased use of the Breede River and the  Olifants-Doring
River catchment areas.
This apparent equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  has  led  to  widespread
complacency. Although it is often acknowledged that water is a  very  scarce
natural resource, with South Africa receiving just more  than  half  of  the
world rainfall average of 900mm per year, water consumption  seems  to  grow
unchecked. This apparent equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  is,  however,
misleading. The reality is that water consumption and demand  for  water  in
our province is growing annually at a rate of 3% to 4%  for  households  and
1,5% to 2% for agriculture. Although the demand continues to grow, there  is
no way to ensure higher levels of rainfall to  compensate.  The  reality  is
that water demand in the Western Cape is a ticking time bomb, which we  must
urgently defuse.

One of the key indicators of just how finely balanced  our  water  situation
in this province is, is that  in  certain  areas  there  is  not  sufficient
surplus water available to sustain the conditions under which natural  water
life can prosper. In some areas present water use will have to  be  reduced,
or new schemes  will  have  to  be  built  to  provide  these  environmental
requirements.

Landbou in die Wes-Kaap is verantwoordelik vir ongeveer 43% van  die  totale
verbruik  van  water  in  die  provinsie,  hoofsaaklik   deur   middel   van
besproeiing. Verder is die stedelike waterverbruik in die provinsie 11%  van
die totale verbruik, bosbou verbruik 5%, voorsiening vir die  reserwe,  soos
vervat in die Nasionale Waterwet, beloop 34% en indringerplante verbruik  7%
van die water in die Wes-Kaap. As daar slegs na  waterverbruik  gekyk  word,
dan is die landbousektor verantwoordelik vir 67%  van  die  totale  verbruik
van water in ons provinsie.

Die realiteit is ook dat daar min opvangsgebiede is waarvandaan daar in  die
toekoms addisionele water aan  die  landbousektor  toegeken  kan  word.  Die
uitbreiding van bestaande besproeiing sal dus hoofsaaklik vanuit  besparings
in huidige waterverbruik voorsien moet word.

Dit is dus net logies dat die  kompetisie  vir  water  in  die  toekoms  sal
toeneem, en die besproeiingsektor sal toenemend betrokke moet  raak  by  die
vind van gebalanseerde oplossings binne die landbousektor en tussen landbou-
 en ander waterverbruikers. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Agriculture in the Western Cape is responsible  for  approximately  43%  of
the total  consumption  of  water  in  the  province,  mainly  by  means  of
irrigation. Furthermore, urban water consumption in the province is  11%  of
the total  consumption,  forestry  consumption  is  5%,  provision  for  the
reserve, as contained in the National Water Act, amounts to 34% and  invader
plants consume 7% of the water in the Western Cape. If one  looks  at  water
consumption only, one sees that the agricultural sector is  responsible  for
67% of the total consumption of water in our province.

In reality there are also few catchment areas from  which  additional  water
can be allocated to the agricultural sector in the future. The extension  of
existing irrigation will  therefore  have  to  be  provided  primarily  from
savings in present water consumption.

It is therefore just logical that the competition for  water  will  increase
in the future, and the irrigation sector will have  to  become  increasingly
involved in finding balanced solutions within the  agricultural  sector  and
between agricultural and other water consumers.]

Factors like changing climatic conditions, population growth  and  pollution
are also impacting on the water supplies of the  Western  Cape.  They  cause
water quality problems such as high salt content, acid water  and  bacterial
contamination.

Other major water quality problems  are  the  result  of  waste  water  from
industry and mining, agricultural fertilisers, erosion, domestic  waste  and
lack of sanitation.  All  of  these  seriously  impact  on  our  ability  as
Government to provide our communities with a healthy supply of fresh water.

Within the City of Cape Town alone, demand is rising  by  20  million  cubic
metres a year. The fact is that until the Berg River Project has been  built
at an estimated cost of R1,4 billion, water restrictions  will  be  part  of
our lives, unless we receive an abnormally high rainfall over  this  period.
After the completion of the dam in  2008,  we  will  have  temporary  relief
until about 2012, after which shortages  will  again  be  experienced  on  a
regular basis.

The building of dams and water schemes is massively expensive. It  has  been
estimated that the cost of water to the Cape Town Metro region will rise  by
about 60c per cubic metre, following the completion of  the  Skuifraam  Dam.
Apart from merely postponing the water shortages, this  near  constant  rise
in costs will make it more difficult to  sustain  the  basic  quantities  of
free water being provided by municipalities -  let  alone  to  expand  these
amounts. Already some towns in our province, like  Hermanus,  Vredendal  and
McGregor, regularly experience water restrictions and  this  situation  will
continue unless we can find longer term solutions.
The provincial government of the Western Cape believes that the key  is  not
to find more water, but rather to  reduce  the  present  demand  for  water.
Government alone cannot solve the problem. It is ultimately up to all of  us
to be informed, to be responsible and to be involved when it  comes  to  the
problems that we as a nation face with regard to our water.

We must become familiar with our local  water  resources,  and  learn  about
ways of disposing harmful household waste, so that they do  not  end  up  in
rivers or streams.  We  must  determine  whether  additional  nutrients  are
needed before fertilisers  are  applied  and  look  for  alternatives  where
fertilisers might run off into surface waters. We have to preserve  existing
trees and plant new trees and  shrubs  to  help  prevent  soil  erosion  and
promote infiltration of water into soil. Our efforts must be geared  towards
the protection of our available water resources.

We are also aware of the responsibilities  of  the  agricultural  sector  in
this regard. Local, provincial and national government  must  find  ways  to
assist our farming communities to keep  soil  and  water  from  running  off
their fields. We cannot control when or how much  water  will  fall  on  our
land, but through research we can help to conserve  water  by  changing  the
soil, plants and the type of farming used to grow crops.

Daar is egter ook ander geleenthede wat benut moet word  om  ons  beskikbare
water meer effektief  te  gebruik.  Gedurende  die  2000-01-waterkrisis  het
Kaapstad reeds goeie vordering gemaak met waterbesparingsmaatreÃ«ls en is  'n
besparing van 14% in waterverbruik behaal. In 1995 het  effektiewe  glyskale
vir die koste van water, en 'n  ewe  effektiewe  opvoedingsprogram,  daartoe
bygedra dat Hermanus se waterverbruik binne een jaar met 22% verminder het.

Hoewel  talle  besproeiers  in  die  Wes-Kaap  reeds  hul  beskikbare  water
effektief benut, is verdere aansienlike besparings  in  die  landbouverbruik
haalbaar indien die algemene effektiwiteit van  waterverbruik  op  plaasvlak
verbeter   word.   Dit   sluit   onder   meer   in   die   evaluering    van
besproeiingstelsels onder veldtoestande. Hierdie  diens  word  tans  gratis,
maar   op   'n   beperkte   skaal   deur   die   Subdirektoraat:    Landbou-
ingenieursdienste  aan  besproeiers  gelewer.  Hoewel  die  uitwerking   van
doeltreffende besproeiingskedulering reeds  alombekend  is,  maak  verbasend
min besproeiers van al die moontlikhede van hierdie  tegniek  gebruik.  Daar
bestaan  dus   tans   'n   behoefte   om   die   voordele   van   effektiewe
besproeiingskedulering onder die aandag van besproeiers te bring.

Die Subdirektoraat:  landbou-ingenieursdienste  is  ook  reeds  sedert  2000
besig  met  'n  projek   om   die   effektiwiteit   in   die   gebruik   van
besproeiingswater op  vier  van  die  belangrikste  landbougewasse,  naamlik
wyndruiwe, tafeldruiwe, pere en pruime te moniteer.  Riglyne  vir  die  breÃ«
besproeiingsektor in die provinsie sal hieruit voortvloei.

Twee  onontginde  waterbronne  in  die  Wes-Kaap  is  die  water   van   die
Doringrivier,  'n  sytak  van  die  Olifantsrivier,  asook  die  water   wat
opgesluit    is    in     die     dieperliggende     akwifers     in     die
Tafelbergsandsteenformasies. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are, however, also other opportunities which must be used to  utilise
our available water more effectively. During the 2000-01 water crisis,  Cape
Town made good progress with water-saving measures and a saving  of  14%  in
water consumption was achieved. In 1995 effective  sliding  scales  for  the
cost of water, and an equally effective  education  programme,  resulted  in
Hermanus' water consumption decreasing by 22% in one year.

Although  many  irrigators  in  the  Western  Cape  already  utilise   their
available water effectively, further considerable  savings  in  agricultural
consumption are viable if general  effectiveness  of  water  consumption  on
farm level is  improved.  That  includes,  inter  alia,  the  evaluation  of
irrigation systems under field conditions. This service is at present  being
provided to irrigators free of charge,  but  on  a  limited  scale,  by  the
Subdirectorate: Agricultural Engineering Services. Although  the  effect  of
efficient irrigation scheduling  is  already  well-known,  surprisingly  few
irrigators make use of all the possibilities of  this  technique.  There  is
therefore a need at present to bring the  benefit  of  effective  irrigation
scheduling to the attention of irrigators.

The Subdirectorate: Agricultural Engineering Services has also been  working
on a project  since  2000  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  in  the  use  of
irrigation water on four of the most important  agricultural  crops,  namely
wine grapes, table  grapes,  pears  and  plums.  Guidelines  for  the  broad
irrigation sector in the province will flow from this.

Two untapped water sources in the  Western  Cape  are  the  water  from  the
Doring River, a tributary of the Olifants River, and the water contained  in
the deeper-lying aquifers in the Table Mountain sandstone formations.]

The Western Cape Olifants-Doring River irrigation study ... [Time expired.]
Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, may I just say that was a very good speech  from
my colleague in the Western Cape. I really have great appreciation  for  the
wonderful work that you are doing, Minister. It is like a  breath  of  fresh
air when I look at some of the tremendous things that you  are  doing;  many
for the first time in our country's history on the scale that you are  doing
them, and with an excellent department behind you.

Land-use decisions are the events that  affect  your  department  most,  and
they create the water needs. Very often you do not have a say in those land-
use decisions which you then consequentially have to deal with. The  trouble
with your department - and may I say it is an  excellent  department  and  I
have only had the best service when I contacted them  -  sometimes  is  that
linkages to other departments with whom you should interact, are  often  not
ideal as far as your laudable objectives are concerned. Of course, you  need
to co-ordinate laterally and vertically  with  other  tiers  of  Government.
Furthermore, much  of  what  other  departments  do  can  impact  upon  your
department.
In my constituency we have landowners who chop out rare, low-land fynbos  in
super sensitive botanical hot spots in the middle  of  a  biosphere  reserve
without permission, pump water day and  night  from  fragile  aquifers,  who
have  done  little  or  no  rain  research  and  plant  potatoes.  The  same
landowners allow large wetlands and sponges to be infested  by  aliens  such
as Port Jackson, which stress the water table and the biodiversity,  without
any pressure or assistance from Government.

It is difficult to get anything effective done when the problems arise.  The
buck gets passed from central to provincial government, and  one  finds  the
real  decision  lies  with  the  Department  of  Agriculture.  However,  the
Department of Agriculture is not biased towards either the  conservation  of
the ground water or the fynbos. They are production orientated, and  I  have
discovered there is no  effective  law  that  is  implementable  to  protect
either the ground water or fynbos,  and  the  officials  have  no  teeth  or
effective sanctions available to them. They  seek  to  do  things  by  moral
persuasion, and I have to say they do them very well.

When it comes to a choice between money or  the  environment,  money  always
wins. Although it is short-termism, it  is  usually  not  in  the  long-term
interests of  the  area  to  protect  the  water  table  and  the  botanical
biodiversity.  It  is  part  of  our  heritage  which  we  have  to  protect
intergenerationally.  Alternative  use  of  the  land,   for   example   for
ecotourism, has greater potential than pumping  water  out  of  aquifers  to
plant potatoes that can be planted  more  successfully  elsewhere  in  areas
where irrigation water is available, or in water rich areas.

I have seen examples where a complaint is lodged, where ... [Time expired.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOÐL: Chair of chairs, it is very heartening that as  we  stand
up to make our input as Mpumalanga, all  the  provinces  are  supportive  of
this department. One was taken by surprise when the hon member Nyakane  from
Limpopo raised that matter, because I thought that as  a  bona  fide  member
from Limpopo, he should not be ignorant of the fact that the great  province
of Limpopo is currently experiencing drought, and that also  has  an  effect
in terms of water provision. I expected that he was not  going  to  wait  to
say that in this debate, because his role as an MP is to interact  with  the
relevant authorities at that level so that  he  ensures  that  he  tries  to
resolve those matters.

That's what I did when I was doing my constituency work  at  Steenbok  where
people were having such shortages, and it was  discovered  that  because  of
the legacy of the bantustans, water schemes  and  water  pipelines  made  it
impossible for the new schemes which were  being  put  in  place  to  supply
adequate water. It just reminded me of what was said  by  one  member  of  a
community in a meeting, namely  that  the  UDM  is  just  like  unauthorised
demons man can trust. [Laughter.]

We welcome the hon member Versveld's support for the department. We  weren't
surprised by that, because she is a person who has fishing at heart and,  of
course,  fish  live  in  the  water.  She  is  supposed  to  support   this.
[Laughter.] However, on a serious note, we really appreciate the work  which
the hon Minister Kasrils is doing. From being an operative  of  the  ANC  in
Operation Vula, where they were opening the way towards our  liberation,  he
has now moved to being an operative to open taps  for  our  people  so  that
they can get water. [Applause.]

Chair, I must just emphasise that the department really plays a  significant
role in making the lives of our people better. Since the dawn  of  democracy
the Department of Water and Forestry has made  huge  strides  in  addressing
the water needs of  South  Africa.  More  than  eight  million  people  have
received access to clean  water,  and  they  have  given  many  women  their
dignity and a better life.

Kuyatiwa-ke  kutsi  bomake  ngibo  labatfolakala  bahamba  libanga   lelidze
betfwele titulutulu nome tigubhu  tekuyawukha  emanti.  Silibonile  lelitiko
lifaka sandla lesikhulu kakhulu  kutsi  bomake  baphumule  kulomtfwalo  wabo
longaka, babuye batfole nekuhlonipheka  njengobe  sihambisana  nemgomo  wabo
wekutsi emanti  akatfolakale  edvutane  nemakhaya.  Translation  of  Siswati
paragraph follows:

[It is a known fact that  it's  the  mothers  who  are  found  walking  long
distances to draw water, carrying big buckets or calabashes.  We  noted  the
determination of the department to put in much  effort  to  relieve  mothers
from their heavy burden, and to afford them their dignity,  as  this  concur
with their policy of bringing water into every homestead.]

The intention of the department is that water should at  least  be  provided
about 200 metres from each and every household. However,  we  are  aware  of
the challenges, especially in the rural areas where you  will  get  some  of
the households that are about 200 to 300 metres  apart,  and  they  have  to
face those challenges. In terms of the White Paper of 1997:


  The development of women in relation to water management is important for
  a number of reasons. Women are  the  traditional  custodians  of  natural
  resources in rural areas, and they are also the  people  who  suffer  the
  most from degradation of water and other natural resources.  It  is  thus
  important that women are represented at all levels, and in all spheres of
  water  management  activities  in  political,  technical  and  managerial
  positions.

This goes to the extent of ensuring that rural women have  equal  access  to
economic opportunities, and enjoy better living conditions  in  relation  to
water  supply  and  sanitation.  Hence  we  welcome  the  position  of   the
department that 30% women representation should prevail  in  all  structures
dealing with water management.

It is important to emphasise  that  in  terms  of  the  Constitution,  water
services are a concurrent Schedule B municipal  function.  Furthermore,  the
Water Services Act, Act 108 of 1997,  assigns  municipalities  the  WSA,  or
water services authority, function. Hence, water  services  rests  primarily
with local government. The national department is responsible for  the  bulk
supply by managing water catchment facilities like  dams  and  rivers,  etc.
DWAF, in that regard, is transferring water schemes to  municipalities.  The
Minister has already alluded to that fact. It will take place  from  1  July
2003. The processes which will take place will include the  reallocation  of
the assets, liabilities, personnel and  budget  between  the  two  types  of
municipalities.

We need to commend our ANC-led Government  on  its  policy  to  provide  six
kilolitres of water free  of  charge  to  all  households.  Already  76%  of
municipalities,  during  the  year  2002,  have   adhered   to   this.   Our
congratulations go to the Kei/Karrieb municipality, the Gamara  municipality
and the Umvoti municipality who have already provided 10  to  12  kilolitres
of water free to households.

However, we must hasten to clarify that  the  free  basic  policy  does  not
extend to sanitation  beyond  the  provision  of  basic  levels  of  on-site
sanitation, that is with regard to the VIP toilets. For  those  who  do  not
know, the VIP toilets are the ventilated improved pit toilets.  We  normally
associate VIP with first class standards, but this is a move to ensure  that
the poorest of the poor also get that basic sanitation service, and that  is
being done  by  our  ANC-led  Government.  It  is  important  to  note  that
sanitation  policy  for   access   to   waterborne   sanitation   is   under
consideration.

In conclusion, we must state our appreciation  and  the  fact  that  we  are
encouraged by the stance on  the  eradication  of  the  apartheid  doctored,
dehumanising  and  racially  based  bucket  system,  which  even  the  Iraqi
prisoners of war are not subjected to.

I stand here on behalf of Mpumalanga to support the vote of  the  Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry. Thank you. [Applause.]

Nk  B  THOMSON:  Sihlalo,  angazi-ke  amalungu  ahloniphekile  uma  esencoma

follows)

[Mrs B THOMSON: Chairperson, I do not know how the hon  Minister  will  know
where he needs to make corrections if members thank him so  profusely.  They
will forgive me because I will talk briefly and not say much, but I  am  not
going to talk about it now. I will first  talk  about  other  things  in  my
speech.]

Clean water and sanitation are important parts of everyone's  life.  Without
water the Government cannot  achieve  its  objective  of  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.  It  is  the  most  important  resource  for  reducing
poverty, diseases and improving the quality  of  life  for  all  poor  South
Africans. The Government has made  the  provision  of  water  to  all  South
Africans a high priority. It is implementing a free basic water  policy,  up
to 6 000 litres of free water per  household  per  month,  as  part  of  the
Integrated Rural Sustainable Development  Strategy.  The  provision  of  six
kilolitres of free water is a simple and practical way of ensuring that  the
poorest  of  the  poor  receive  a  basic  water  supply.  The  Government's
initiative of free basic water services is appropriate, as it assists  rural
people, including farm labourers, who have struggled in  getting  access  to
water.

The  water  services  policy  recognises   the   role   of   community-based
organisations as water service  providers,  particularly  for  small  scale,
rural  water  service  schemes.  Efficient  functioning  of  water   service
institutions and their viability is a key to sustaining  water  services  in
rural and urban areas. The South African water sector  is  complex,  with  a
wide range  of  organisations  contributing  to  the  development  of  water
resources. Water resource management is the national Government's  function,
whilst the actual delivery of services is undertaken by  service  providers,
such as municipalities. Much of the ultimate responsibility  for  delivering
free basic water lies with local municipalities.

Ngizothinta kancane  nje  ngokuthi  ngithi  mhlawumbe  thina  KwaZulu-Natali

paragraphs follows.)

[I will briefly mention that perhaps we in KwaZulu-Natal did  not  have  the
luck of winning that province with an absolute majority.  I  think  that  is
giving us problems now.
It is important to focus the  hon  Minister's  attention  and  that  of  the
workers on the area called the Sisonke district. In Sisonke seeing a tap  is
uncommon. Perhaps I should say it is as uncommon as the  teeth  of  a  witch
because one cannot see it, since a witch  does  not  laugh.  She  is  always
furious and wants to kill people. Watertaps are  like  that  in  that  area.
They are not visible. It is important for the hon Minister to know that.  In
areas like Underberg, Donnybrook and Riverside  in  particular,  people  are
still fetching water from the river. They compete with cattle.

Because the ANC taught me ``to tell it as it is'',  like,  if  something  is
bitter, I must say it is bitter, and if it  is  sweet,  I  must  say  it  is
sweet. The fact that these areas have no drinkable water is not  a  pleasant
one to us who were sent there by people like you, hon Minister,  to  go  and
work there. It is not nice, because it gives  us  problems  as  we  have  to
carry water in our cars and hide it so that people will not see us  drinking
it, since they will be suspicious and wonder why we are not  drinking  their
dirty water.
I would like to be invited by the department one day - or if  I  can  invite
the department - and take officials to these areas that I am talking  about.
I do not believe that people like Versfeld know what is it to crank for  the
water to be able to come out. People still crank in these  areas.  There  is
this thing called ``cranking  for  water  to  come  out''.  I  am  sure  Mrs
Versfeld does not know what that is. She  has  never  come  across  a  water
crank. One needs to be physically strong to be able to crank because if  one
is weak, the water will not come out. So one might end  up  not  cooking  if
one is physically weak.]

To this  end,  the  roll-out  programme  for  delivering  free  basic  water
included numerous activities to  provide  the  necessary  support  to  local
government. This included the establishment of a free basic  water  strategy
task  team  to  prepare   and   investigate   an   implementation   strategy
countrywide, the  preparation  of  a  guideline  document  to  assist  local
municipalities in applying free basic water policies and the preparation  of
a  financial  model  and  programme  assistance  manual  to   assist   local
municipalities in  evaluating  the  financial  sustainability  of  different
approaches to supplying a free basic water service. Through this  assistance
a  significant  number  of  municipalities   with   major   challenges   are
implementing the free basic water service policy.

Water is also critical for the development of the  agricultural  sector  for
commercial, emerging and subsistence farming and other economic  activities.
Water is important for  rural  development,  increasing  food  security  and
promoting health, particularly  in  rural  communities.  Deep  inequalities,
including access to water services, are a legacy  of  post  apartheid  South
Africa. Emerging farmers have had to  struggle  with  reasonable  access  to
water. As a result of the Government's  water  policy,  their  concerns  are
being addressed.

The principle of equity is central to the water law. Special  attention  has
been given to addressing the needs of those  who  were  historically  denied
access to water or the economic benefits of water. We appreciate  the  steps
taken by the Government in its  attempt  to  provide  access  to  sanitation
services to all citizens by the year 2010.

Nalapha,  mhlonishwa  Ngqongqoshe,  kuzobaluleka   ngikusho   ukuthi   lokhu
engiqeda  ukukhuluma  ngakho  kuyinto  esingakayiboni   kahle   kule   ndawo

(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Even here, hon Minister, it is important to mention that what I  have  just
talked about is something that has not yet come to  the  areas  that  I  was
talking about. If one is in these areas, one will see people  going  to  the
other side of the hill or hiding by the trees and do what they are there  to
do because they do not have toilets, which hon WindvoÃ«l is talking about.]

In this regard we recognise and appreciate South Africa's  leading  role  at
the recent Eleventh United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development  in
ensuring that the resolutions  on  sanitation  taken  at  the  International
Conference on Sustainable Development  are  implemented.  A  challenge  that
remains is the fact that access by local municipalities to  capital  funding
remains  a  problem.  The  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  is
responsible  for  funding,  particularly  for  rural  areas.  The  funds  of
consolidated infrastructural  municipality  programmes  for  some  districts
have been used up. In some areas it is impossible  to  provide  reticulatory
water, given the inaccessible  topography.  This,  therefore,  implies  that
communities in  these  areas  can  only  have  access  to  its  springs  and
boreholes, equipped with landpumps, which are acceptable, which are  usually
a kilometre far. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF WATER  AFFAIRS  AND  FORESTRY:  Siyabonga  kakhulu  Sihlalo.
[Thank you very much, Chairperson.] I think  that  was  an  excellent  input
from the members. I listened to all the  inputs  with  great  interest  and,
certainly, the members of the House show an intimate  understanding  of  our
water resources and our forestry.

We have had very cogent expressions of concerns relating to water  shortage,
water quality, the problem of drought and the issue of forests versus  water
provision. Of course, the very  key  problem,  which  the  last  hon  member
mentioned, are those areas, such as Donnybrook,  which  still  do  not  have
water, and which for all of us is the greatest challenge. Above  everything,
the priority is to ensure that  everyone's  basic  constitutional  right  to
water is fulfilled, which was mentioned by an earlier input.

I would like to immediately  state  that  the  reason  why  there  are  some
announcements which I will make on  Friday  -  I  think  the  hon  Mackenzie
raised this point if I remember correctly - and not here, is  that  one  has
to provide some division of work between here and the  Assembly,  given  the
time factor. I was about to let the cat out of the  bag  in  my  assault  on
those who seek to undermine us through falsities, but the time had run  out,
as your time had run out in your excellent input.

Incidentally, it is a pity that the hon Mackenzie had run out of time,  just
as he was coming to a very  salient  aspect  of  his  input,  and  that  was
suggestions to the department. This is really what I, the Ministry  and  the
department are very open to, and I really appreciate the  hon  Durr's  point
about the department and its responsiveness. They certainly deserve  to  get
that kind of praise. I thank you very much.

The department and its Minister are there with open doors to serve in  terms
of Batho Pele. That is emphasised from  my  desk  to  my  Director-General's
desk and  down.  Where  members  are  not  quite  up  to  scratch  with  the
professional  standards  required,  I  am  talking  about  the   department,
councillors, members of the public, the MECs, members of this House and  the
National Assembly should bring it  to  our  attention.  We  carry  out  very
serious investigations, and this is taking place all the time.
I would, in that spirit, tell to hon Mackenzie and  others,  like  our  good
friend Nyakane who was complaining about the water cuts in Limpopo, that  we
do not even need to wait. Why wait until the  Minister  comes  here  once  a
year, or once in a blue moon, to answer questions or to speak.  It  is  very
important. Antoinette Versfeld raised an issue last year, and  I  thank  her
for  her  acknowledgement  of  the  way  the  Minister  and  the  department
responded.

The door is open, and many of  you  know  that,  as  they  know  it  in  the
National Assembly, at any  particular  time.  I  want  to  tell  hon  member
Nyakane, what he discovered seems to have been going on over quite a  number
of months - the water  shortages  in  the  villages  that  he  referred  to,
Malamulele and so on. I am surprised. Why not immediately knock on  my  door
and say: Wena, Minister, do you know how the people are suffering?  What  is
happening there? Why is there no water in  that  village?  I  am  the  first
person who wants to know. My department, hon members, cannot be  everywhere.
Very often it is that ring of the phone, the knock on the door or  a  member
of this House catching hold of me in the passages and saying: Listen,  there
is a problem in such and such a place. And I would immediately  say:  Please
put it in writing, because  I  am  afraid  the  head  loses  a  lot  of  the
information these days. I am getting a bit  old  now.  So,  on  a  piece  of
paper, that is all I request.

In terms of some immediate responses - and looking at the time, we  seem  to
be ending a little earlier than we thought - I would like to  respond,  with
the patience of the Chair. I believe every  member  deserves  some  kind  of
response. I will therefore start with Reverend  Moatshe  and  his  input.  I
think that he gave a brilliant exposition and an overview of the work of  my
department and its functions over nine years, which is greatly  appreciated,
and I would really like to have a copy of that for publication.

Coming to the member from the Eastern Cape, member  Dlulane,  I  was  really
taken with her reference to the green forests of the Eastern Cape being  the
gold of the Eastern Cape. It is  a  lovely  expression,  and  that  gold  is
elsewhere in the rural areas. We do have to find  a  way  of  balancing  the
needs. Forestry does a great deal for  rural  poverty  eradication  and  job
creation. Money is beginning to flow into the pockets of  the  rural  people
through the way the forestry restructuring is taking place. I  mentioned  it
in my presentation.

The Eastern Cape is perhaps, as we know, one of  the  most  poverty-stricken
areas of the country. We have heard about the water problems there as  well.
Through the forestry  development,  as  I  indicated,  we  really  are  very
excited about the possibilities for that province. I single it out,  because
although we have some good  forests  in  Limpopo,  Mpumalanga  and  KwaZulu-
Natal, it is the Eastern Cape which actually has  tremendous  potential  for
further development in relation to rural villages and communities.  I  would
also like to say to hon  Dlulane  that  the  question  of  the  need  to  be
involved in the integrated development programmes that were referred to,  is
very important. It is our policy that all  our  activities,  from  water  to
forestry, agriculture, land, small and medium  businesses  and  so  on,  get
looked at in an integrated way through  Government,  and  in  terms  of  the
integrated programmes.

Regarding the role of the water boards, I listened carefully. It is quite  a
contentious area, but the water boards must be helped to work,  and  we  can
look at very good examples in the  country.  I  have  referred  to  the  hon
Nyakane's input, and I can already tell him  that  the  Malumalele  area  is
having  problems.  My  understanding  is  that  currently  people  in  those
villages get water three times a week. That  is  my  understanding  from  my
department. You show me that it is once  a  month.  Let  us  get  the  facts
straight. We are well aware  of  what  is  happening  there,  and  this  was
provided in a rejoinder to you by the hon WindvoÃ«l who said that there is  a
drought, and the drought is affecting many provinces, but first of  all  and
foremost the Limpopo province, and then Mpumalanga, and it has been  hitting
elsewhere, including the Western Cape.

So, there is the drought problem, and also there is another  point  that  he
made, and that is the schemes that were put in  through  the  seventies  and
eighties  by  the  erstwhile  homeland  governments.  Those   schemes   were
certainly not sustainable. Communities were  not  involved,  and  they  were
second-rate. We inherited a lot of these, and  instead  of  just  abandoning
them, we tried a rehabilitation approach, because there are  limits  to  the
kind of budgets that we have. So, we are battling with that. However,  there
is good news, because the scheme serving that area,  the  Tshikundu  Scheme,
will come onstream in September to help resolve the very situation that  has
been mentioned. I ask you to check on that for me. My  information  is  that
it is September, and I would like you to contact me. Maybe I will  be  there
in September. Please contact me, and let me know how you see that  situation
developing.

There was mention about urban and rural differences. I would say  that  this
Government is doing what no other  government  has  done  in  this  country,
ever, and what you will find happening in very few countries,  and  that  is
giving tremendous priority and emphasis to the rural people.  Although  even
then we hear the heartfelt statement by hon  Thomson  pointing  out  certain
villages, and I will go  there  with  you  to  visit  the  villages  of  the
Donnybrook area that  you  mentioned.  I  will  take  along  members  of  my
department like Deputy Director-General Dipapang Puthwana, who is in  charge
of operations throughout the country. He will go there. He will  give  me  a
report. We will see what we can do.

However, let me  make  this  very  important  point:  It  is  not  just  the
department - it is the same point made about the question  of  Moatshe,  and
to hon Thomson and others - it is municipal governments. They are  not  only
going to get more responsibility in the future. They have it now,  and  they
are our first line of attention. The municipal governments, through  to  the
district councils and the  provinces,  tell  me:  Minister,  these  are  our
priorities for our province. I do not choose their  areas.  I  look  at  the
budget. We have a formula of apportioning the budget per province  and  then
per district council in terms of  the  backlog  in  relation  to  water  and
sanitation. How do we split the cake then? According  to  the  numbers  that
still need to be served. Those district  councils  then  have  to  work  out
business plans, and present it to me, saying where they will use  the  money
this year, next year and so on.

When members like you come to me and say that in such and such an  area  the
people are really suffering, and this is what is needed, I will  get  on  to
it through the province, through to the district  council,  through  to  the
municipality. I will say: What is happening here? Can't we do  something  to
fast-track? I  will  raise  it  with  my  Director-General  and  his  senior
executive, and we will look at the possibilities to see  whether  there  can
be additional funding for an area that  has  people  who  are  suffering  so
much. Of course, there are still 5 to 6  million  people  that  have  to  be
reached. That is the problem that the hon Thomson pointed out.  Were  we  to
have that magic wand, were we to have  the  ``thagathi''  and  the  muti  to
waive it, so that tomorrow everyone had water, we would be  over  the  moon,
but we know it comes to the question of ``imali'' [money] and  planning.  It
is a process.
Another four years is a long time to  wait  for  water  for  the  people  in
Donnybrook. We know that we can only reach all these people by  2008,  as  I
have indicated, but let us see what we can do.  The  other  possibilities  I
keep looking at, interim possibilities, of maybe some additional  boreholes,
less expensive projects that can fill in the  gaps  in  the  meantime.  This
will, at least, give people a better life while  they  are  waiting  in  the
long 5 million queue. That is a key strategic interest for  myself  and  the
department.

Now I come to ``mfowethu'' [my brother] Mackenzie here.  Incidentally,  when
he talks about the wild goats eating everything, he  talks  about  something
that some of our people tend to refer to as ``insangu'', which  some  of  us
know as dagga. But do goats eat insangu?  I  would  be  very  interested  to
know. I have seen some funny goats in my time, but  Ã¿.Ã¿.Ã¿.  [Laughter.]  Let
me say that we have got your input, which was very useful.

As for hon Durr, he raised the question of forestry and its  impact  on  the
environment, the question of the Act  and  that  of  stream-flow  reduction.
This is very much in our minds. I have discussions with the forestry  sector
all the time, and I would say that we are  making  great  headway  with  the
Forestry Act, with the Sappis and Mondis, who are showing a  greater  degree
of responsibility. Again, let us have the information. You are our eyes  and
ears on the ground, irrespective of party colour -  absolutely  irrespective
of party colour.

You are members elected to this House of Assembly and you must tell  me,  as
hon Versfeld did, this is the problem, when are you  coming.  I  went  there
with Ms Versfeld, and met the council of the Berg River Municipality.  There
were very few members from my party there. It was not  an  issue.  It  is  a
question of how best to serve the people, listening  to  the  voice  of  our
people, onse mense, jikelele ikhaya South Africa. And, as hon  Versfeld  has
seen, there was a very serious exchange  and  a  report-back.  Incidentally,
just today I have signed off a very  long  letter  to  the  municipality  in
relation to what we have come up with in terms of  all  the  questions  that
were raised.
In relation to the Clanwilliam Dam, we are looking at  that  very  issue.  I
can assure you that you will get a  response  from  me.  The  approach,  the
raising of it, is necessary. We are looking at, and investigating how to  do
this, and what the best possible approach would be. Next year it  might  not
be myself standing  here,  but  certainly,  whoever  is  Minister  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry, you owe it to whoever else is sitting  here,  to  give
that account, if you indeed are sitting here.

Let me turn to hon Van Niekerk,  who  made  a  very  good  input  about  the
irrigation along the Orange River, and again asked me,  ``Well,  what  about
the question of De Aar? What has the Minister got to contribute  to  this?''
This was raised last year. I have had a major meeting in the course  of  the
year with the Premier of the Northern Cape, his officials and  his  MEC  for
Agriculture. We looked at plans for De Aar and whether we could  pipe  water
from the Orange River to De Aar. It is incredibly expensive.  I  showed  the
Premier exactly what I had  answered  you  -  I  think  last  year  -  those
problems, and why we have to rely on borehole water  in  the  area.  Another
friend from De Aar is nodding over here.

However, what I can tell you is that I said to the  Premier,  ``You  provide
me with your business plan. How do we develop  that  part  of  the  Karoo?''
Maybe there are other ways, other than a pipeline from the river to De  Aar.
Let us look at it holistically. They are drawing up  that  plan,  and  I  am
waiting to  see  it.  It  has  to  involve  agriculture  for  the  province,
obviously that department, as well as Water Affairs at a national level,  as
well.

However, there are exciting things happening along the Orange River. We  are
looking to resettle a community of people who lost their rights to live  and
work on farming land which is now covered with water of the Gariep  and  Van
Der Kloof Dams. The farmers were paid out, but the  labourers  got  nothing.
They were scattered to the winds.

They  have  made  contact  with  me.  We  can't   provide   reparations   or
compensation for the millions who lost out in the apartheid  era,  but  with
the Premiers and the MECs of the Free State and the Northern  Cape,  we  are
looking at possibilities to provide them with water allocation  and  to  get
them going as farmers along land which both Premiers  and  MECs  from  those
provinces have in fact earmarked, and are earmarking. So, we are looking  at
things in a holistic way.

I am just finishing off. I want to say to the hon Naicker, on the  equitable
share used for water in terms of  the  new  municipal  infrastructure  grant
arrangements, we will spend more time and  energy  helping  to  ensure  that
funds are used by local governments for the  purposes  for  which  they  are
intended. I don't know whether it's Pietermaritzburg, but I think there  has
been a bit of a problem  there,  and  in  other  areas  where  some  of  the
municipalities are not using these grants  for  free  basic  water.  I  will
cajole them and I will name and shame them, because that water is meant  for
free basic amounts.

On the Dukuduku issue, it has been a slow  process,  but  people  are  being
relocated to the new farm land.  There  is  a  small  number  who  are  very
stubborn, and who are refusing to go. They have taken the issue to the  Land
Claims Court, as you have referred to. However, I really doubt whether  they
will be allowed to stay in that  forest,  because  there  is  land  that  my
department has bought, and the province is involved in the housing  and  the
development. We have to save the Dukuduku Forest.  There  are  very  few  of
these natural forests left in our country.

I just have to mention to the representative  from  the  Western  Cape  -  I
believe the name Gelderblom was used, but I know  the  MEC  Gelderblom,  and
that doesn't seem to be him. I didn't get your name. Unless  there's  a  new
MEC ... [Interjection.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: He is the chairperson.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Oh, the chairperson. Thank  you.
I didn't get the name; is it Byneveldt?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Byneveldt, yes.

The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY: Ah, thanks. Good  to  meet  you,
sir. I welcome the points that were  made  and  the  way  the  province  has
identified the long-term challenges of water supply. The work done  to  draw
attention to this has been very good in this province, such as the need  for
demand management  and  the  restrictions  that  were  applied  by  regional
directors. Sitting up there is Rashid Kahn who was responsible for that.

It did show us two years ago that people in this country - in this  case  it
was the Western Cape - were responsive when we raised the problem  of  water
scarcity. They did respond very positively. The fact that we are building  a
dam on the Berg River, obviously, is in answer to  the  development  of  the
province, Cape Town, the farming  community,  the  population  developments,
etc. And it is not enough. We have  got  to  do  more.  We  are  looking  at
groundwater exploration, and that seems  to  have  tremendous  potential  in
this province.

Let me end here by saying that, not only in the Gulf states and  the  Middle
East, but in an arid country like South Africa,  there's  going  to  come  a
time when we  do  numerous  things  to  augment  our  water  shortage.  Like
Namibia, like Windhoek, we are going to have to recycle  the  water  in  the
city seven times. I have drunk that  water  in  Windhoek  which  has  passed
through human bodies seven times.  It  was  very  fine,  and  I  didn't  get
unwell.

Like the Middle East, we are  going  to  have  to  desalinate.  Port  Alfred
already has, and there's been a bit of an experiment on  Robben  Island.  It
did't work out very well. Cape Town, for sure, is going to have to  develop.
There is plenty of water there, you see. It is  a  question  of  technology,
which is there, and it is a question then of the price. The  price  we  will
have to pay, which is why ``siyabonga  kakhulu,  enkosi''  [thank  you  very
much, thank you] for the way in which  the  members  have  shown  that  they
understand the precious water resource, which we must  maintain  sustainably
for future generations, for our children and their children.
Let me end by saying that we can be positive and optimistic.  My  department
has a blueprint for our survival,  the  National  Water  Resource  Strategy.
It's going to be published soon. And that shows us how we  can  ensure  that
we have security for the future.

Baie dankie, almal. [Applous.] [Thank you very much, everyone. [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, hon Minister.  I'm  sure
you have been entertained by members of  this  House.  This  actually  shows
how, as provincial representatives, they know what they are  talking  about.
They know where the problem areas are. I'm sure  it  would  have  been  very
nice, hon Minister, for you to let the cat out of the bag here, rather  than
in the National Assembly. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.
