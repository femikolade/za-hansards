                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 1 - The Presidency:

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Thank you very much, Madam Speaker and
members of the House. The Deputy President has just told the Deputy Chief
Whip of the Majority Party that he has just disclosed a state secret.
[Laughter.] And therefore I trust the police will take the necessary
action! [Laughter.]

Madam Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy
Ministers, hon leaders of our political parties, hon members, distinguished
guests and ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for affording us the
opportunity to address Parliament on the occasion of our Budget Vote.

As is customary, the Deputy President will also address the House on
various issues the Presidency deals with, including the important matters
of Aids, the legislature, elements of our international work and moral
regeneration of our society. The Minister in the Presidency will speak to
Parliament on the issues of gender equity, the rights of people with
disabilities, the rights of children and matters relating to the youth.

On 28 December last year, Andrew Gerber, who turned 28 last Friday,
overcame the cold and difficult conditions of the Antarctic to reach the
South Pole on foot, the first South African to do so. [Applause.]

In January of this year, Marion Cole captained the loveLife yacht, sailing
with a young black crew in the Cape to Rio Yacht Race. These young South
Africans traversed the forbidding waters of the Atlantic Ocean as bearers
of the torch of freedom in the quest to mobilise global action against the
common health challenges of our time. [Applause.]

On 26 May this year Sibusiso Vilane conquered Mount Everest, the highest
mountain in the world, becoming the first black person to do so.
[Applause.] Sean Wisedale also did South Africa and Africa proud by
reaching the top of Mount Everest. [Applause.]

Only two days ago, on our national Youth Day, Fusi Nhlapo whose birthday we
celebrate today - happy birthday, Fusi! [Applause] - gave further
inspiration to all of us when he won the Comrades Marathon. [Applause.]
Quite correctly, yesterday this House conveyed its congratulations to Fusi
and the other runners who led the thousands of participating athletes into
the Kingsmead Stadium on Monday.

According to its outstanding principal, Dave Robinson, Bryanston High
School in Gauteng has a stated aim as a community school to contribute
positively to our wider community. The learners are encouraged at all times
to think of others and to translate their sympathy for those less fortunate
into action. He says:


  Our Grade 11 group, in particular, is encouraged to take part in charity
  committees. Through the representative council of learners and related
  leadership projects we have helped various organisations over the past
  three years. The teacher in charge of these projects is Mrs Gill
  Fulscher, one of our heads of department, who has been an inspiration to
  the learners in terms of vision and devotion.

As a result of the exciting programme carried out by this school to
contribute positively to the wider community, two of its learners, Kevin
Tregurtha and Tasmin Nash, decided to do something about the street
children of Hillbrow, Johannesburg. This is what Kevin has written in this
regard:


  I saw a programme on e-tv about children sleeping under boxes on the
  streets, and I decided that I want to help in a different way. I then
  approached our grade controller with the idea and asked Tasmin if she
  would be willing to help.


  From there on it took us lots of phone calls to various companies, but
  finally things started to come together and the big night, the 3rd of
  June, arrived. At about 6:30 pm we arrived at the Hillbrow police station
  with our four blanket-filled cars. After about an hour we had the police
  escort we had been waiting for.


  We then made our way to our first stop, where, as the car stopped, people
  started rushing towards us. We then moved on to our next stop. They had
  already been told we were coming. We then offloaded the bakkie. We saw
  only hands and faces which were desperately pulling on our clothes, our
  boxes and the blankets we were giving out. Once the bakkie had been
  cleared we then moved on to our next stop. As we were leaving, people
  were knocking on the car's windows, trying to prevent us from leaving.


  Once we had left Hillbrow, we could then reflect on what we had seen;
  children sniffing glue, the way that people actually lived and little
  girls walking around with one-month-old babies on their hips. That night
  sincerely touched our hearts. The people had tears in their eyes and we
  could see that they appreciated what they had been given. We would do it
  again.

[Applause.]


  We have an image of what things are going to be like and nothing could
  have prepared us for what we have seen, and we'll be hoping to do more
  projects like this.

[Applause.]

Palesa Mohapi is 18 years old. In May she won the international English-
Speaking Union debate in London in competition with her peers from across
the world. In her award-winning speech Palesa spoke of the role of women in
the African Renaissance. Among other things, she said:


  In the pursuit of these things women have an important role to play -
  women like my grandmother, who worked at two jobs in order to send her
  children to the best schools.

Having described the successful poverty alleviation programme in Swaziland
run by women, she continues:


  These women, like my grandmother, are making positive change, and this is
  a fundamental part of the African Renaissance.

[Applause.] I agree, and I'm sure this House agrees, and thank you very
much, Palesa, for your wise words.

Andrew Gerber, the young people who sailed with Marion Cole, Sibusiso
Vilane, Fusi Nhlapo, Palesa Mohapi, Kevin Tregurtha and Tasmin Nash have,
through their distinguished achievements, spoken for all of us. They are
saying the tide has turned and Africa's time has come. It must surely be a
matter of great pride to all of us that these messages are conveyed to us
by the youth of our country. What they have done has served to answer those
in our country who regularly present both a false and negative picture of
our youth and a pessimistic view of the future of our country.

Their achievements tell the story that we have many young people in our
country who are full of initiative, who are highly intelligent, brave and
disciplined, determined to live in and contribute to the building of a
winning nation and ready to engage this task with the patience and
persistence of a marathon runner. When we say the tide has turned and that
Africa's time has come, we say so because we are confident of the role that
the youth are playing and will continue to play to ensure that our country
and continent continue along the difficult road that will lead all of
Africa to stable democratic systems, to peace and stability, to prosperity
and eradication of poverty, and the restoration of the dignity of all
Africa's women, children and men.

As we observe June as Youth Month, the month of Youth Day, once more we
extend our salute to our youth and ensure them that we'll continue to work
together with them for the improvement of their conditions of life,
focusing on the challenges of youth development and empowerment.

I'm very pleased and honoured that we have in the House today the young
heroes and heroines I've mentioned. These are Sibusiso Vilane, the
conqueror of Mount Everest; Palesa Mohapi, a victor in the conveyance of
the challenges of the African Renaissance; Marion Cole, representing the
youth who sailed the oceans to link us with the Americas and communicate an
important message concerning the health of our youth and country; Fusi
Nhlapo, who has refused to be deterred by the loneliness of the long-
distance runner and discouraged by the fact of unemployment, and Kevin
Tregurtha and Tasmin Nash, who brought warmth and hope to the street
children of Hillbrow and all our towns and cities. Andrew Gerber is
currently out of the country, otherwise he too would have honoured us with
his presence. [Applause.] And here they sit.

Together with them, I would also like to welcome to the House Mr Mike
Bernard, representing the sponsor of Sibusiso Vilane; Sibusiso Vilane's
wife and child; the Reverend Mohapi, Palesa's father; Sean Wisedale and his
partner, Joy Simmonds; Brian Cole, Marion's husband; Mr and Mrs Gerber, the
parents of Andrew Gerber, and Dave Robinson, the principal of Bryanston
High. They also ... [Applause.] To all of them I'd like to extend our
profound thanks for everything they've done to inspire and support the
young patriots and achievers we are privileged to salute today. What you
have done has enabled our country also to stand tall among the nations
because we stand on your shoulders which have carried the young people who
sit in the gallery to the pinnacles of achievement they have attained.

Madam Speaker, Sibusiso and Sean gave me this flag. This is  the  flag  that
Sibusiso took to the top of Mount Everest ... [Applause.] ... and that  Sean
then brought down from the top of Mount Everest. [Applause.] What they  said
was that this flag should belong to the Museum  of  Parliament,  so  I  will
hand it  over  to  you,  Madam  Speaker,  when  I  have  finished  speaking.
[Applause.]

We've also spoken of the need for all of us to join hands in a people's
contract for a better tomorrow. In this regard I'm pleased that after much
preparatory work, the social partners at Nedlac came together on 7 June at
the Growth and Development Summit to adopt the extensive agreement
negotiated by the social partners. I'm happy to commend this agreement to
this House and urge hon members to see in what ways they can contribute to
its implementation and the implementation of its various programmes,
continuing to be inspired by the practices of Letsema and Vukuzenzele.

In the past some in our country called for an economic Codesa. This
reflected a genuine and understandable desire on their part that we develop
a national consensus on economic questions. In this way we would come
together in a people's contract for economic growth and development, for
the liquidation of the legacy of colonialism and apartheid, and for the
eradication of poverty. The agreement arrived at in the Growth and
Development Summit says, among other things:


  During deliberations, it was agreed that a vision for growth and
  development should be adopted, a set of priorities for joint action
  identified and a process set in place to ensure that the identified
  programme of action is carried out.

It goes on to say that:


  ... the Summit is launching a process for a longer-term dialogue that
  will require the Nedlac Executive Council to continue to focus and engage
  on as well as consider how to address the key challenges and options at
  hand - above all, job creation, economic growth and overcoming the
  massive inequalities left by apartheid ... The constituencies of Nedlac -
  government, business, labour and the community - reaffirm their
  commitment to social dialogue and working together to address the
  economic and development challenges our country faces.

It goes on to say that:


  Nedlac chambers and structures will have standing items on their  agendas
  dealing with the GDS  agreements  and  receive  regular  reports  on  the
  progress of the implementation of the agreements.
  Constituencies commit to an annual review by the Executive Council of
  Nedlac, of the success of the GDS agreements and to making adjustments
  where necessary.

Some in our country predicted that the GDS would fail. Without even seeing
the documents negotiated by the social partners, they stated that the GDS
had failed even before it took place. In its aftermath they found it
necessary to assert that they have proved their prowess as soothsayers.

However, even a cursory reading of the GDS agreement will indicate that the
summit achieved the goals that had been set. It has provided us with a
central and decisive element of the national consensus on the challenges of
economic growth and development that some of our compatriots had called
for. Beyond this, as demonstrated by the passages from the agreement we
have cited, the Nedlac social partners have committed themselves to a
process to monitor and ensure the implementation of the agreements they
have reached. This indicates the seriousness with which the social partners
approach the responsibilities with which they were charged.

This House, and our national Parliament as a whole, would also do well to
interest itself in the implementation of these agreements in a constructive
manner, focused on helping to achieve the results decided at the GDS.
Beyond what we have said, the Growth and Development Summit represented a
concrete and important response to our call to all our people to enter into
a people's contract for a better South Africa.

In this regard, I would like to extend our profound appreciation to
business, labour and the community organisations for responding to the call
made by Government that we should join forces in the people's contract we
need to ensure that we make faster progress towards the achievement of the
socioeconomic goals that stand at the centre of our objective to create a
people-centred society. This response has helped to consolidate the
critically important process in our country in terms of which we are
further strengthening the unity in action of our country and people. This
is not only emerging as a distinct feature of our democracy, consistent
with the vision that the people shall govern, but constitutes a vital
contribution to the continuing struggle to build a nonracial and nonsexist
society, and achieve national reconciliation.

It was indeed inspiring to see gathered at the GDS our people in all their
races and colours and with significant numbers of women, all united to
implement an eminently practical programme of action to address the common
challenges we all face as South Africans, regardless of colour and race and
gender and class.

As I've already said, we are currently observing Youth Month dedicated to
the advancement of that important section of our population, the youth. It
was very good that the GDS ensured that it paid the necessary attention to
the matter of youth development and empowerment.  In this regard, among
other things, the GDS agreement says:


  The majority of the unemployed are young. It is increasingly difficult
  for young people to find work - partly because there are not enough jobs,
  and partly because the young do not have the skills that are in demand in
  the labour market. Women, people with disabilities, and those living in
  rural areas face additional obstacles to finding employment and
  developing their skills. Currently too few young people are given
  opportunities to improve their skills in areas that will enhance their
  employability.

Running through the GDS agreement is a necessary focus on programmes to
meet the identified challenges of skills and employment opportunities that
face our youth. What this means is that just as we said of our youth that
they must act to change our country and continent for the better, as the
young people who've honoured us with their presence in the House today have
done, so we too have an obligation to ensure that we respond to the
challenges facing the youth of our country.

In this regard I would like to extend our sincere thanks to those in the
private sector who are responding to these. Specifically, among others, I
would like to thank Absa Bank for the enthusiasm and readiness with which
it entered into an agreement with the youth concerning its SMME Incubator
Fund, co-operation with the Umsobomvu Youth Fund on youth economic
empowerment programmes and the National Youth Commission on youth
learnerships in finance and information and communication technology.
[Applause.]

Another financial institution, First National Bank, has also responded to
our call to assist with the skills development of our people, particularly
the youth, by embarking on a learnership programme in line with the
National Human Resource Development Strategy. From January next year the
bank will take on 1 200 matriculants for the purpose of learnerships,
phased over three years. Currently there are other learners being taken
through a CIDA City Campus degree programme and given on-the-job training
with the help of professionals from the bank and the rest of the private
sector. [Applause.]

These important financial institutions have set an example in terms of what
can and needs to be done. I trust that others within the private sector
will follow their excellent example.

The Growth and Development Summit said:


  Constituencies note the intention of the youth sector to invite
  contributions towards a voluntary youth solidarity fund, where all
  employed youth will be invited by youth organisations to contribute one
  day's gross salary to youth development programmes.

I trust that these employed youth will respond to this call with the same
enthusiasm with which Absa and First National Bank responded to the request
of the youth to enter into partnership with these important players in the
private sector. Since I am part of these employed youth ... [Laughter] ...
Zanele Mbeki and I have agreed that I should contribute one day's gross
salary to the projected youth solidarity fund. [Applause.] This I will do
during this, our Youth Month.

It is in the context of the foregoing that we are happy to  report  to  this
House about some of the work that the Presidency has done in the past  year,
to add to the efforts of many South Africans  as  they  participate  in  the
people's contract to build a better tomorrow.

In this regard, I would like to make a special reference to the process of
izimbizo. Through the Imbizo campaign we have continued to engage our
people about the work that we are doing together to transform our country
and bring about a better life.

We visited Gauteng and the North West since we reported to Parliament last
year. Again, we have encountered in these provinces, as has been the case
in others, the masses of our people ready and eager to participate in the
processes of changing their living conditions for the better.
Levai Mbatha Health Centre in Evaton demonstrated the implementation of the
principles of Batho Pele. Mailakgang School in the North West has given
meaning to the spirit of Vukuzenzele. The housing project in the village of
Makgola in Zeerust embraced the ethos of Letsema.

The Imbizo campaign has become the feature of government at all levels.
What is important is that we must be able to make prompt and appropriate
interventions once we have interacted with our people and be prepared to
act swiftly on desperate and urgent matters that confront them.

We have to improve the system  of  monitoring  the  extent  and  quality  of
Government's response to the  issues  that  are  raised  during  the  Imbizo
campaign, so that these interactions do not become routine gatherings  which
do not help to effect change.

As the Growth and Development Summit decided, an important part of building
this better tomorrow is constantly and critically to examine the progress
we are making to change the conditions of our people for the better.

In this regard, the Presidency is currently engaged in a 10-year review,
the objective of which is to assess the impact all of us have made on our
development and challenges of transformation during our first decade of
freedom.

Though this work is not yet complete, one of the things that is clear is
that the welfare of our people has improved through the deracialisation and
radical improvement of social service delivery. More people now get health
care, education, pensions, electricity, clean water and housing, and as a
result, we are succeeding to improve the quality of life of our people.

Further, the review shows that despite impressive gains in almost all
aspects of government, the Public Service must be further transformed if
the state is to sustain the improvement of the life of the poor and the
marginalised in our society.

Financial, human resource and asset management have to be improved to make
further advances in the process of government integration and better
delivery across all spheres of government.

Further to improve on our performance, this year's Government budgeting
cycle will see the formulation of a Medium-Term Strategic Framework led by
the Presidency, with the participation of all departments of Government.

The Medium-Term Strategic Framework encapsulates the key challenges
confronting Government in the medium term that need to be taken into
account in deciding on the Budget. Further, it is informed by the global
socioeconomic and political climate and the possible risks for the country.

This will further strengthen the co-ordinating role played by the Forum of
South African Directors-General or Fosad, the sector Clusters of Directors-
General, and the President's Co-ordinating Council that brings together the
provincial premiers and the President.
To expedite the realisation of our policy objectives, the DG Clusters have
been charged with the preparation of implementation reports, which are then
submitted to the appropriate Cabinet committees, for subsequent assessment
by the Cabinet.

Further, the Presidency has formulated a National Spatial Development
Perspective on the basis of a study of the country's social and economic
environment and spatial trends over the past decades.

The objective of this perspective is to develop guidelines to ensure that
Government's infrastructure investment and development spending programmes
have better spatial outcomes than are currently being achieved.

We reported last year that we have seen positive developments in the
functioning of Government as a whole. The work of improving the functioning
of Government is an ongoing one, and we will continue to identify
inefficiencies and blockages, until we arrive at the point where all public
representatives and public servants are truly defined by the ethos of Batho
Pele, of hard work, selflessness, dedication and service to the people.

We will continue to increase the capacity of local government and embark on
a deliberate and conscious effort of deploying the best people at that
sphere of government and implement a systematic programme of training,
retraining and improving the skills of all the workers. This we must do so
that we can implement our programmes more efficiently and effectively.

In the past year, the economy continued to grow reasonably well, in spite
of the tightening of monetary policy that was necessitated by the sharp
rise in inflation that resulted from the temporary weakening of the rand,
and the slowdown in the global economy.

We are confident that the decisions taken at the Growth and Development
Summit, and other interventions, will enable our country to perform even
better than it has done, creating the possibility for all of us to respond
more effectively to challenges we face together.

The system of the Presidential Working Groups and the International
Advisory Councils has sufficiently matured in the past year. In these
forums, we have continued to discuss and seek solutions to the fundamental
issues that cut across the entire business of Government and the overall
development of South African society.

Together they constitute an important part of the people's contract we are
building at home and abroad, which unites millions of people and important
decision-makers in the common effort to achieve the reconstruction and
development of our country.

We are pleased that we have now established the Higher Education Working
Group that brings together the vice-chancellors of universities and
technikons, and Government. The critical challenge for this working group
is to contribute to the development of a shared agenda for the
transformation of the system of higher education and to reposition the
institutions in this sector to play a more meaningful role in the
transformation of our society.

We are working seriously to establish the youth working group that the
youth themselves have suggested and requested.

Of great importance also is the fact that both the International Advisory
Council on Information Society and Development and the International
Investment Council suggested that, in addition to their general advisory
tasks, they would like to participate more specifically in contributing to
our country's development programmes. This has positioned them as important
players within the inclusive people's contract for a better future.

Together we must work to implement what we have agreed with regard to the
TRC, always conscious that we have a continuing responsibility to build on
the advances we have made with regard to the task of national
reconciliation.

As you are aware, we had the honour of hosting the important meeting of the
transformation of the Organisation of African Unity into the African Union
in July 2002.

Next month we will be handing over the chairpersonship of this continental
organisation to President Chissano of Mozambique. We would like to convey
our thanks to this House for the important work it has done to ensure that
we make our contribution to the advancement of the African Union.
[Applause.]

In particular, I would like to thank the hon members for attending
expeditiously to the matter of the Protocol on the Establishment of the
Peace and Security Council, so that together with our brothers and sisters
in various African countries, we can work systematically within the Union
to bring peace and stability to our continent.

We are also encouraged by the role that this Parliament has played, under
the leadership of the Speaker, which contributed to the progress that has
been made on the process towards the formation of the Pan- African
Parliament. [Applause.]

I would also like to thank our Minister of Foreign Affairs, the hon
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Deputy Minister Aziz Pahad, and the Department of
Foreign Affairs for the enormous amount of work they have done to make the
Union operational. [Applause.]

All of us are aware of the enormous challenges facing our continent as we
work for its renewal. Prominent among these is the task of successfully
addressing the issues of poverty and underdevelopment.

Through the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the development
programme of the Union, we continue our efforts to work for the development
and regeneration of our continent.

As we know, South Africa is hosting the Secretariat of Nepad and the
Presidency has taken this extra responsibility, with Prof Nkuhlu heading
the Secretariat, which is tasked with the day-to-day leadership of the
Nepad process. I must say thank you very much to the professor for what he
is doing, and I am glad he is here with us today. [Applause.]

Through the Nepad process we have ensured that Africa takes ownership of
its development agenda. The process has also ensured ongoing dialogue among
African leaders on the critical matters of peace and security, democracy,
political and economic governance, and socioeconomic development. It has
also provided a new paradigm in terms of our interaction with our
development partners, including the identification of Africa's development
priorities.

I also thank our Ministers and Deputy Ministers, directors-general and
state corporations for the important contributions they have made within
their specific areas of competence to advance the Nepad process.

In our capacity as the chair of the African Union, we have been called upon
to attend to the important matters of peace and security on our continent,
always working with other leaders as well as our regional structures.

As a result, we have all seen important progress in Madagascar, Sudan, Côte
d'Ivoire, Burundi, the DRC and Angola. What remains to be done with regard
to these and other matters will be done. As I have said in this House
before, I am certain that the people of Zimbabwe will find a solution to
their problems.

Today we have three other important visitors in the House. These are the
three presidents who lead the islands that make up the Comoros, Mr Abdou
Soule Elbak of the Grand Comoros, Mr Mohamed Said Fazul of Moheli, and Col
Mohamed Baker of Anjouan. They are in our country and this House to see
what they can take from us as they work to consolidate democracy and peace
in their country. [Applause.]

We would like to assure them that we will continue to work with them and
Federal President Azhali on these and other matters, as we have been doing
for some time already.

We are ready to respond to the requests that have already been made by
various representatives of the Iraqi people to work with them as they
strive to build a democratic and stable Iraq. Similarly, we will continue
to work with other nations to ensure that the United Nations is
strengthened and plays its role as defined by its charter.

We continue to pay the closest attention to the vital issue of the
implementation of the road map for peace between Israel and Palestine, and
will make such contributions as may be necessary and possible towards the
achievement of this goal.

We are pleased that through our foreign ministers, Brazil, India and South
Africa have taken the first step to build a partnership among themselves as
part of the process of strengthening South-South relations. [Applause.]

Again, last year we hosted the World Summit on Sustainable Development and
made our contribution to the important outcome contained in the
Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. Government, through the Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism, continues to play a central role in
following up the decisions of the summit.

We meet during a month in which we remember the role played by the youth of
this country in our liberation. Again, we are happy that the youth of today
continues to inspire us and in many ways challenge us to strive towards
higher achievements.

We have a duty to respond to this challenge and give further substance to
our conclusion that the tide has turned, and concrete proof of our
commitment to do more to bring a better life to all our people.

I would like to thank the Deputy President, the Minister in the Presidency,
the director-general and our entire staff for working hard to ensure that
we discharge our responsibilities to the best of our abilities.

I would also like to thank all other departments, Ministers and Deputy
Ministers, premiers, the provincial and local governments for working with
the Presidency to ensure that we consolidate policy development and
implementation throughout Government.

I am honoured to commend the Budget Vote of the Presidency to the House. I
thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Madam Speaker, hon
President, Deputy President, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, hon members,
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, today you have
shared with us in this august House your Budget Vote. In it you outlined
what your office, the Presidency, has been able to achieve and hopes to
achieve in this last year of this term of office before our elections.

In the final analysis, ours as a country and a people is, as Mongane Wally
Serote said, "a tough tale'' for, truly, we have come a long way. While,
indeed, not spotless white shirts, we are really khaki and the rain, dust
and wind did it all. Under your stewardship as President we, indeed, have
come a long way in delivering democracy and its benefits to our people. In
our labours to deliver a better life for all, we are not spotless white
shirts.

We have had to roll up our sleeves and walk the dusty road at the crack of
dawn. We have had to weather the storms with limited resources; and
balanced our expenditure to best meet the needs of our people in the
cities, townships and remote villages of our vast land.

When we read about pensioners who die in queues while waiting to receive
their pension grants in some rural villages of our country, we are
painfully reminded that ours is and has been a tough tale. But, through
your leadership, you have made us look for solutions to these problems that
we face and never give up.

The interventions that have been made by the Departments of Social
Development and Public Service and Administration, working with the
nongovernmental organisations, have made us turn the tide. The celebration
of Children's Day in Port Elizabeth by Government, civil society and
religious communities was one such example that showed us that in working
together with our people we can find a solution to even the most
challenging problems that we face. Indeed, it is this resilience that has
made your cadres in the Public Service work tirelessly to produce change in
the quality of our service that we deliver to the citizens.

The various Ministers and Deputy Ministers, in their Budget Votes in this
House, have indicated how they and their public servants, together with the
resources that have been given to them, have worked to ensure that we make
a difference in the quality of life of all South Africans. In the same
breath, we rejoice when we see how we have been able to reach those who
were the forgotten souls in the land of their birth. In partnership with
religious communities, we have brought social security delivery closer to
those who need it. As a caring Government, we have provided relief in the
form of food parcels and funds to those who lost their goods during the
natural disasters that befell our country last year in various provinces.
We have done that through working with local government, traditional
leaders and communities. We cannot but appreciate how far we have gone in
building a people's contract for a better tomorrow.

Again, Serote also told us that every birth has its blood and that ours
would be no different. In our delivery from our not-so-distant past, we
have spilt our blood to reach our salvation and deliver democracy and
development to our people. This has been a public process and an experience
known by all in our country. But, like births which are the special
preserve of women, the pain has been felt more acutely by the impoverished
in our land. These are still disproportionately our mothers and fathers in
rural areas and children who depend on them. But the delivery of democracy
to our country, to our people, and the accompanying pain, the rupture of
tissue and the spilling of blood to deliver a new life in all its beauty
and glory would have been so much more traumatic without a midwife, which
is what you and your office have been. With you at the helm, we have been
able to turn such a physiologically traumatic exercise into euphoria and
elation - an experience perhaps only a woman would know, perhaps only a
mother would know and perhaps only the ANC would know. [Applause.]

As this House votes on your budget for this year, we must take note of the
journey that we have travelled and the distance that we have covered. We
must register the road ahead; lay bare the provisions that we will need to
successfully negotiate the future so that we reach our destiny. In 1999, Mr
President, when you took office you called all South Africans to work in
partnership with Government in order to transform this society for the
better. In the year 2000, during your Budget Vote in this House, you
reminded us of the unfinished business in our country, Africa and the
world, the challenge of poverty and underdevelopment and what we need to do
as a country to extricate ourselves from this very challenge. In 2002, you
gave us hope that no matter how tough the challenge may be, we as citizens,
working with Government, have the capacity to push away the frontiers of
poverty by taking the initiative to do things that can change South Africa
for the better. You forced us to dare to dream, pushed us to the limit to
do things that, otherwise, we might have thought impossible. In an
integrated and focused way, the Public Service has dared to go an extra
mile in delivering Government services to the citizens and, indeed, has
made Batho Pele a reality.

The progress that has been made in building synergy can be seen in the way
in which departments, through the clusters, are working and making an
impact. The work of the justice, crime prevention and security cluster has
improved our capacity to deal with crime in our society. The Integrated
Nutrition Programme is another example of how, within the social services
cluster of Government, we were able to respond to the crisis of food prices
in October last year. In the context of integrated sustainable rural
development, of which you were a pioneer, progress has been made indeed in
a number of nodes. I can just name an example by mentioning Kgalakgadi in
the Northern Cape and North West. The Diputi enterprise which remains an
anchor project has seen the expansion of the Bendel women's project to
other areas of Taung in the North West where, today, about 42 co-operatives
have been set up and comprise 200 people, the majority of whom are women
who are now breeding and rearing goats for the market. All of them have
been trained and are now in full production. [Applause.]

Rural infrastructure projects have also commenced. We are seeing the
construction of roads that link the villages in that node. We have seen the
establishment by Eskom of the energy centre which has ensured that people
are able to purchase their energy sources closer to where they are. In
other nodes, we have seen the impact of the Community-Based Public Works
Programme where the building of the local infrastructure that supports both
social development and economic growth has been undertaken. This programme,
which remains one of the important job creators of Government, has seen, to
date, the creation of about 106 000 job opportunities in rural communities,
some of which are temporal in nature while others have created a
possibility for long-term employment in the area of maintenance.

The community production centres, on the other hand, have helped
rehabilitate some of the infrastructure that is critical for sustainable
production in rural areas of our country such as Ncora, Keiskammahoek and
Aribie in Limpopo. All these have made it possible for the rural
development initiatives of Government to make an impact in fighting poverty
in our country. If asked, "How have we been able to do all of this?" I
would answer, "You said: Masivuke sizenzele [Let us wake up and do things
for ourselves]." You made us become volunteers of change in our own
society. From this we have laid the foundations of a better South Africa, a
better Africa and a better world.

Indeed, this call has been heard by a vast majority in our country, and
some of that majority are the youth that we see in this House. When Mama
and Tata Ludidi, in Elukholweni village at Mount Frere, in the Eastern
Cape, decided to contribute to a sustainable food production programme at
their local level by purchasing two tractors for their village, and built a
school for the children in that community; when we see the young people in
Langa Township working as volunteers to clean up Langa Stadium with the
Minister of Sport and Recreation; and when we see the images on the SABC of
the young people in Soweto and elsewhere who have volunteered to look after
the orphans and the elderly in their community, we can truly say that we
are building a people's contract for a better tomorrow and a caring
society. [Applause.]

This is contrary to what we sometimes hear from those who still wish us to
fall and fail and use the challenges that we face which sometimes are
reflected in our failures and say, "We told you so." But South Africans who
want to build a better society are the ones who have come up and said, "We
can lend a helping hand to push away the frontiers of poverty and
underdevelopment." It is those people who have said, "We are willing to
become volunteers for reconstruction and development." One such example has
been the partnership that was developed between Government and the private
sector through the Business Trust which, among others, has made critical
interventions in the area of education, tourism and health - particularly
in the fight against malaria in the Lubombo Spatial Development Initiative.

The partnership that has developed between farmer organisations and
Government through the development of the agricultural sector strategy has
ensured that many South Africans within this sector are able to develop
partnerships, and share experiences and expertise in order to achieve the
best for our country. It has also created a framework from which we can
deal with challenging issues that our society still needs to face, such as
land reform.

Mr President, in your debate you have also raised the important role that
this Government and your office, in particular, have placed on youth
development. A number of departments have attempted in their areas of work
to impact on young people in a manner that strengthens their existing
capacity and capabilities. They also appreciate that, as young people, they
are also aware what their needs and responsibilities are as citizens of
this country. The various departments have put in place learnership
programmes within the National Skills Development Strategy that introduce
learnerships as a mechanism to address the problem of skills and
unemployment. For example, the Department of Labour has reported during its
budget debate in this House that about 8 159 young people have benefited
from these programmes.

Only yesterday, the Minister for Intelligence showcased some of the young
cadres who have made a choice to defend our democracy by ensuring that
indeed, as she said yesterday, "We can sleep peacefully and have an
ordinary day while they don't sleep and have an extraordinary one in order
to make us safe." [Applause.] The work that the National Youth Commission
is doing together with the Land Bank and Umsobomvu Fund in the creation of
young farmers is but just another example of how the South African youth
are seizing the opportunity that our democracy has created.

Mr President, in your leadership, you have affirmed the role of women in
our society. Your office has focused on the challenges that women face and
demanded that the whole of Government and our society should work with
women as equal partners in development and peace initiatives. Through your
office, which also includes the spousal office, we have seen a growing
movement for peace and democracy. Within the ambit of the Congolese
dialogue, the spousal office convened a meeting which brought more than 120
women from the Congo who represented political parties, religious bodies,
business, traditional leaders and nongovernmental organisations to South
Africa in order to have a dialogue with their counterparts on how we can
build bridges for peace in the Congo.

I am happy to say, Mr President, that some of those women are here in the
different political parties. The delegation was led by Comrade Lulu
Xingwana and Mama Harriet Ngubane. [Applause.] The South African delegation
was able to share their own experience of how they have participated in the
political process that has led us towards our own liberation as a country.
This is a form of solidarity work that is aimed at supporting the Congolese
women in their own transition but, more importantly, to ensure that they
become ambassadors of peace in their own country. A follow-up meeting was
held in partnership with Unifem in Kinshasa to ensure that these
experiences can reach the majority of Congolese people and, indeed, the
people of the Great Lakes region.

The spousal office has therefore decided to also convene another meeting,
in July this year, of the South African women where we can all reflect
where we have come from as women of South Africa, what we have been able to
achieve, and what it is that we can do in the context of Nepad to develop
our country and to contribute to the development of Africa so that indeed
through this experience South African women can become a beacon of hope for
peace and development in our own country and the world.

We have come a long way, being khaki, not spotless white shirts. Indeed,
with your leadership, you as the midwife and the ANC as our mother, we will
be able to deliver a better life for our people. [Applause.]

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION:  Madam Speaker, since I am not Marilyn
Monroe, let me say, rather than sing: Happy birthday, Mr President. And I
would like to compliment the hon Minister of Agriculture. I am sure that
was a very career-enhancing speech. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Antjie Krog once wrote that ``reconciliation is not only a process; it is a
cycle that will be repeated many times.'' Now, I heard the hon President
say today that those who had been critical or doubtful or skeptical about
the recent GDS were wrong; that the GDS was a success. I do not know,
frankly, how anything can be a success or a failure two weeks after it has
happened when it projects growth rates and job rates, without actually
knowing if they are going to happen or not. Surely it is not conferences
and seminars that will determine job creation in this country, but our
political will and our economic policies. In the four years that we have
been in this Parliament and the five years before that and the four years
of President Mbeki's Presidency, we have moved from MERG to the RDP to Gear
and now to the GDS and its protocols. And with all those movements, we have
also moved from job creation to job shedding. And the only success of this
or any other policy is whether it delivers on its promises. Motive,
background, saying, gainsaying are actually irrelevant to actual delivery
on the ground.

To go back to what Antjie Krog said, I am sure all will agree that all
South Africans wish to avoid a cycle that becomes a downward spiral in
which smouldering resentment has fanned into burning anger. The last time
President Mbeki addressed this Parliament, on 5 June, he issued us with a
warning. He said - and he took the warning from General Viljoen: "I would
like to advise those who find it politically and strategically expedient to
perpetuate the negative stereotype of the African, which we inherited from
our past, to take the greatest care that they do not start a fire they
cannot put out."

But the question then becomes: On whose watch has South Africa moved from
the politics of rainbow nationism and reconciliation to the politics of
race-labelling, race-holding and even race-baiting? [Interjections.] I
believe that when the President attacks us, as he did by inference today
and, more explicitly, last time he was here, on pessimism and doom saying,
he, in fact, should lead by example. Because, when the leader of this
country - and he is leader of the whole country, not just of the ANC - uses
racism in order to silence his political opponents, I believe that you re-
ignite the fires of hatred and despair that South Africa has worked hard to
extinguish.
Let us consider an acute case that was dealt with only in one sentence
today - the case of Zimbabwe. [Interjections.] There is a new book. Well,
some of these people do not like Zimbabwe. We do! [Interjections.] There is
a new book that has just hit the shelves, in which the President of South
Africa is quoted as saying the following - and I quote from the book: ``The
reason Zimbabwe is such a preoccupation'', President Mbeki said, ``here, in
the UK, in the US and in Sweden, is because white people died and white
people were deprived of their property. All they say is Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe,
Zimbabwe."

It is certainly true that some people - black people and white people -
have viewed events in Zimbabwe through a racist lens. But, if that explains
why some people are making a noise, it does not tell us why the President
himself is so quiet. Why is he quiet about Africans - black and white - who
are being dispossessed of their property? Why is he quiet about the black
leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe who is deprived of his liberty? Why is
he so quiet when it is reported, in the latest edition of Africa
Confidential, that our hon Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the arrest
and detention of Morgan Tsvangirai really amounted to a question of: "Let
him take his own medicine". [Interjections.]

Now, last week in Parliament, the hon Graham McIntosh, an MP over there,
from the DA was chastised by the hon Minister of Defence for raising this
issue in Parliament. And the Minister of Defence relied on a stock response
by mentioning the white government of the old South Africa in an attempt to
discredit and delegitimise Mr McIntosh.

But what are the realities of that situation and that hon member? In 1977,
the hon Mr McIntosh then represented Pinetown for the Progressive Federal
Party. And he performed what, by the likes of the times, was regarded as a
fairly drastic and dramatic action at the time. He and his wife went on an
eight-day hunger strike, starving themselves for the same length of time
that black consciousness leader, Steve Biko had been in police hands. He
and his wife, who joined this protest, wanted to demonstrate that Steve
Biko could not have died of starvation, as claimed by the former Minister
of Justice of the National Party, Mr Jimmy Kruger.

Now that protest, for what it was worth, carried a political cost to Mr
McIntosh. A few weeks later, at the next election, Mr McIntosh lost his
seat to a member of the National Party.

In the same year, 1977, at the same time, the staunchest supporter of Mr
Jimmy Kruger was his son, Eitel, who was at university when I was at
another university. When we met at a SRCs conference, he used to persecute
anyone who held mildly progressive views that were to the left of them,
including me. [Interjections.] Now that same man, that same man ...
[Interjections.] It was before you had converted yourself to the realities
of the market economy, and you were not so right-wing, Trevor! That same
man today, Mr Eitel Kruger, is a leading member of the ANC in Pretoria. Mr
McIntosh is in the DA!

This ANC party ... [Interjections.] And you were in the tricameral
Parliament then. This ANC party has sworn into this Parliament a politician
who happens to be black, who took his money from the apartheid department
of military intelligence in order to go to the United States in order to
denounce the concept of black majority rule in Washington.

I am mentioning these illustrations about real live people around us here,
because where does race-based politics take us? What does race tell us
about a person, about his motivations, about her background? I do not
believe it tells us the truth about South Africa. I believe it rekindles
fear and does not advance democracy or the wellbeing of ordinary South
Africans.

We must ask ourselves what place it has in a modern, democratic country
that has committed itself by word and by deed and in its Constitution to
reconciliation. But again, for all the other attributes of this Presidency,
and I am happy to acknowledge them - the President has enough praise
singers in his presence today on the programme - the President has used
race to deflect legitimate criticism.

Aids has turned into an issue which will dwarf all other issues, if by the
year 2010 6 million of our South Africans die. Aids has been converted from
a medical emergency into a racial issue. In May last year, Prof Makgoba,
then President of the Medical Research Council, said that the President's
Office had waged a campaign of vilification against him for challenging the
President's views on HIV/Aids. According to Prof Makgoba, the President's
Office appealed: "... to a very basic instinct. I am an African like them
and therefore I should be in their camp and I am not. I am a stooge of
whites. I am less of an African."

Yet HIV/Aids cannot be an issue of black and white. It surely is a matter
of life and death, with 35 000 South African children who died in 2001,
because we did not give them nevirapine at the cost of what would have been
a few rand.

But, there is another tactic and it is to be found on the Internet. It is
the tactic of flaming. On the Internet, flaming is when someone uses a
barrage of inflammatory, hostile or derogatory messages in order to provoke
or intimidate another person. And we have had flaming, unfortunately, from
the Presidency. The most grotesque stereotypes of African people are
conjured up in the President's imagination and presented to the South
African public, telling us these grisly ideas of the things that the
critics, the legitimate constitutional critics of Government policy,
embrace and endorse.

We had this recently in respect of the arms deal and my colleague, Raenette
Taljaard, will deal with that at greater length. But we did not just have
it on the Internet. We had it in this House recently. The President said
that those who stand up against Government corruption are merely "fishers
of corrupt men". But the President himself, with respect, insists on
fishing for racism in the minds and hearts of all his opponents.

Now, I would say that if we are going to succeed, then the most alarming
suggestion that has been made by the President was that we should make use
of the worst stereotypes in measuring our progress. The President said
recently: "We must constantly assess our behaviour critically to determine
whether in fact we are not acting in a manner that confirms the stereotype
of the African, as described by those who denied to us our humanity." Why
should Africa be defined by the worst images of its detractors? Why should
we, as Africans, live forever in the shadow of "those who denied us our
humanity"?

The reason that the New Partnership for Africa's Development is so
supported across the board, is because of its pledge to "promote peace and
stability, democracy, sound management and people-centered development and
to hold each other accountable in terms of the agreements outlined in the
programme".

Those are forward-looking standards by which we must judge ourselves, not
by the racist hysteria of the past. If we want South Africa to become a
real democracy, we are going to have to face the real issues: poverty,
joblessness, crime, HIV/Aids, and yes, because it is on our doorstep,
Zimbabwe as well. [Interjections.] We need to have a dialogue about the
questions that matter most.

I was very struck the other day, Madam Speaker, by a speech which you
yourself made in this Parliament in which you said we must embrace unity
and inclusivity and gave some very powerful examples of that. But if we are
going to make all questions of national importance into matters of race,
then we are going to be in a dead-end street. I believe we need to get out
of that cul-de-sac of racism and return to the inspiring vision of the
rainbow nation.

It is a criticism of this elected Government and my party as the elected
opposition, that there is not much of a dialogue or discourse between us. I
believe that criticism has validity and I believe there should be, but I do
not believe any dialogue is going to happen if we simply stereotype and
typecast each other or project onto each other. I believe we must abandon
the politics as they have been practised, and undertake a serious dialogue
about the fundamental changes that we all need in this country as we begin
a second decade of democracy. I thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam Speaker, His Excellency the President,
His Excellency the Deputy President, hon Ministers, hon members and the hon
the Leader of the Opposition, the debate on the budget of the Presidency
calls upon this House to assess the contribution of the Presidency towards
the building of our democracy and the proper and effective governance of
our country. In other words, we are here to audit his performance inasmuch
as our performance as line-function Ministers is also audited by this
House.

This is the time in which the legislature, including its members from the
ruling party, is to fulfil its constitutional responsibility of holding the
President accountable to the people he has been elected to represent. This
is the time in which we must praise the achievements of our Presidency and
also highlight any of its shortcomings.  If we fail to do so across
political divides, then the constitutional machinery breaks down its most
sensitive component. This is the time when we give substance to every
opportunity to fully comprehend that the higher the public office, the
greater its responsibility, and most intense must be the scrutiny to which
it is subjected and its accountability, failing which democracy has failed
and the spectre of tyranny and autocracy is ready to rise.

We must praise our President for any of his great achievements we may
identify, but we must not hold him to be above and beyond criticism. If our
respect for him prevents us from criticising, we can very well start
drafting the funeral oration for our ailing democracy. [Interjections.]

The Presidency performs the fundamental role in our constitutional system
as it combines two demanding offices, that of the Head of State and that of
the Head of Government. Our Presidency has been indirectly involved in a
variety of issues which affect the whole of our society, even when the
actual implementation of issues has been carried out by us as line-function
Ministers of the President. This is appropriate as this type of collegial
government which our Constitution entrenches, leaves with the President the
ultimate responsibility and accountability for the exercise of the whole of
the executive power.

In the past year, specific matters have received the guidance and
leadership of the Presidency, ranging from health issues to defence policy,
while in other matters the Presidency did not provide its leadership when
it perhaps should have. We are here also to assess in what respect the
Presidency provided or failed to provide in its leadership.

Amongst the matters which more directly received the guidance of the
Presidency, and directly that of our President, has been foreign affairs,
especially in respect of our continent. We praise our President for the
leadership he provided in formulating a blueprint for the future
international integration of our continent. The formation of the African
Union was an important step in that direction which worked hand in hand
with the formulation of a blueprint for the formation of the social and
economic development of our continent through the New Partnership for
Africa's Development.

Nepad will forever carry the mark of President Mbeki's initial leadership.
In order to attend to these matters of great and historical importance, the
President had to spend a substantial amount of time abroad. We perfectly
understand that, but we have missed his leadership in respect of pressing
crises at home.

Many important matters require presidential leadership in order for good
intentions to become actual policies and plans of action which can
transform our country. For me the most important items on the agenda remain
measures aimed at stimulating economic growth and promoting employment
generation. Our economy is not growing fast enough. Too many people remain
unemployed and poverty is rising throughout all marginalised areas of our
society and territory. This is the first priority, in my view, to which we
must attend. Unless our economy is put into overdrive, all other problems
will not find a solution. Reform of the labour market to introduce greater
flexibility and employment-generation ideas has also seized the
intermittent attention of the Presidency.

The Presidency has been seized with the issue of the moral regeneration of
our society, which lies at the foundation of our effort to fight crime and
set back the rising wave of corruption. The battle against crime is of
vital importance to all our citizens. We have not made sufficient inroads
in fighting the culture of crime, rebellion and lawlessness which
unfortunately is gaining ground in many of our communities. We must bury
this growing phenomenon before it acquires such a momentum that it may
exercise influence over the very structures charged with the responsibility
of eradicating it.

We must praise the Presidency, especially President Mbeki himself, for the
efforts made in promoting national reconciliation.  We should not
underestimate the enormous contribution to reconciliation and national
stability which President Mbeki rendered when, on his own initiative and
will, he opted to allow the IFP to participate in the Government of the
country even though he was no longer obliged to do so after the June 1999
elections. Our issue would have been very different after June 1999 had the
President not chosen to take heed of the lessons of other African countries
and broadened the bases of support of his Government to include me and my
party.

In our African context, the consolidation of democracy is an arduous and
long task, especially when democracy is to flourish on the polluted soil of
ancient bloody and fratricidal conflicts. Democracy in South Africa could
have taken root just by virtue of the fact that a somehow free and fair
election was held. It would not have taken root because of that election on
one day on 27 April 1994. Democracy is not an event but a process, and
President Mbeki has nourished this process, realising how much it needed to
be fed with reconciliation.

I would like to say, however, that the path of reconciliation has not been
concluded and the process may not reach its intended destination. The IFP
and the ANC have spent much time discussing the nature and purposes of
reconciliation. Reconciliation is not about eliminating the normal tensions
and dialectics of democracy to force consensus and political militarism,
but is rather about creating conditions of mutual respect, peace and good
faith in which ordinary tensions, conflicts and dialectics of democracy may
take place without tearing apart the fabric of democracy.

The purposes of reconciliation were primarily aimed at redressing the
legacy of past conflicts, vilification and propaganda which still bedevil
interparty relations and the political discourse. In the final analysis,
only through this type of reconciliation may our country receive the
blessing of an effective democracy where opponents are respected without
becoming enemies, and dissent and criticisms may flourish and be fully
accepted. This foundation of mutual respect and trust has not yet been laid
down. Past problems have not been addressed and they continue to bedevil
our future. I still get very concerned when the robust debate which is
accepted in parliaments throughout the world, and the heckling here goes on
beyond that and becomes intimidation, as you have just seen now. It is
still difficult to have open, frank debates and strong criticisms in this
House. Our democracy is so much the weaker because of this. For me this
remains perhaps one of the most saddening aspects in the unfinished agenda
of the Presidency.

I also regret that our Government has not seen its way clear to fulfilling
the many promises that were made to traditional leaders. As a member of
this Government, I feel embarrassed to have been directly part of such
promises, such as the written one which was solemnly signed on 20 November
2000 just before the holding of the December 2000 local government
elections. In the document signed by His Excellency the Deputy President
Jacob Zuma, who was mandated by the President to lead the committee of
Ministers charged with the task to negotiate a solution to the issue of
traditional leadership, it was promised that chapters 7 and 12 of the
Constitution would be amended to make provision for local government powers
of traditional authorities as soon as possible, but this never happened. A
system of municipal government is now being consolidated in such a fashion
that no allowance has been made and no longer can be made for traditional
authorities.

When I discuss with traditional leaders that next year we will be
celebrating the 10th anniversary of our liberation and democracy, I am
often asked by them what liberation has done for traditional leadership.
Now, it is possible that our first black Government has damaged traditional
leadership more than any previous white government in spite of the promises
contained in the Constitution, disregarding each of the features of
traditional leadership from land administration to indigenous law, from
local government to family matters. [Interjections.] We need to build the
social stability and economic prosperity of South Africa on the basis of
the honourability and the reliability of our institutions of government and
those who lead them.  We need to list more clearly our national priorities
to give content to our promises of a pluralist and multicultural society,
ranging from the preservation of a role for traditional leadership to the
protection of the cultures of our various communities. I am aware that in
the present season the pressures to move ahead with the process of
development and modernisation are enormous, not only in our country but
across the world. Opportunities are not waiting for us and those who stay
behind are just going to be left there for a very long time to endure their
ancestral poverty and underdevelopment. However, while we commit ourselves
to moving forward at maximum speed, and if need be, to leapfrogging ahead,
we must also have a clear understanding of what we are to carry with us and
what we are to leave behind. We must move forward carrying with us the
features of our being African and of our being part of that unique African
experience that is South Africa, a land of general multiculturalism and
indigenous diversity.

My concern is that our priorities' agenda is not sufficiently focused on
speeding up the process of moving forward which depends on development,
development and development, which in turn is a function of economic
growth, the fight against crime and our international credibility with the
affluent population of developed countries. None of these three aspects has
been sufficiently prioritised. We need not only focus on physical
development, but first and foremost on human development which means to
transform our people to enable them to move from an underdeveloped world to
a fully developed one in such a fashion that they are the agents and
promoters of this development rather than its casualties and victims.
Unless we focus on this type of comprehensive and holistic development, the
pursuance of visions at an international level or other domestic agendas
are bound to be in great jeopardy.

Our people need the full measure of attention which our Government can give
them and we hope that the Presidency will be able to provide its tested and
strong leadership to move the country forward on the path of development at
a much faster pace and on the basis of a vision which allows us to draw
value from being Africans born and bred in the unique country of South
Africa. Mzizi! Dlamini! [Applause.]

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Madam Speaker, the President of the Republic, hon
members, special guests in the gallery, let me begin by expressing my very
best wishes to the President on his birthday. As we are of the same age ...
[Laughter] ... I know exactly what a wonderful feeling it is to enjoy
maturity. [Laughter.]

As we will be celebrating 10 years of democracy in April next year, I think
it is important that in discussing this budget today we bear in mind a
number of things. When we adopted our Constitution in 1996, we laid a firm
foundation for a democratic and open South Africa, which belongs to all who
live in it, black and white, and for a government based on the will of the
people. I am reminded of this as next Thursday marks the 48th anniversary
of the Freedom Charter which set out the vision of our democratic society.

Indeed, as we celebrate 10 years of democracy in April next year, we will
do so with great enthusiasm given how far we have travelled in pursuit of
our goals. The restoration of human dignity and freedom to all our people
is an achievement we should all treasure.

We now have a stable democracy, a growing economy, and peace and stability.
Most importantly, access to a better life and the provision of basic needs
are being expanded day by day to citizens. As a nation we have also
perfected the art of working together and forming partnerships to deal with
any challenge, be it social, economic or political. These partnerships are
a recipe for continued success.

With regard to Parliament, we have achieved a lot in nine years. If we
look, in particular, at the accountability of the executive to Parliament,
we will see that things are remarkably different compared to what they were
before the advent of democracy. I see a Parliament that performs effective
oversight, whether through interaction with Ministers or officials in
committees, or outside Parliament by looking at how laws and policies are
being implemented.

Parliament subjects legislation introduced by the executive to extensive
scrutiny and, in most cases, amends the Bills before it. It also holds the
executive to account in the form of, amongst other things, parliamentary
questions and Budget Votes.

This very Budget Vote on the Presidency comes at the end of an extensive
and thorough process of examining the work and budgets of all the
government departments. I am told that in the National Assembly alone, 78
hours and 34 minutes were spent in plenaries debating the different Budget
Votes. This excludes the time spent in the National Council of Provinces
and the extensive work done in the portfolio or select committees in
considering the budget. Truly, we have a system of government in which the
people really govern.

This does not mean that there is no room for improvement. I am therefore
encouraged by the work that Parliament has done in examining how it should
implement the concepts of oversight and accountability. I look forward to
the finalisation of that process.

I believe that in affirming the type of government we are developing, we
need to move away from the notion that accountability and oversight can
best be performed by an opposition that has to be unnecessarily
antagonistic to the executive. What is required is an opposition that is
constructive in its engagement with the executive and which will help us
build this country. We need to see executive accountability and
parliamentary oversight as a partnership that is aimed at leading to
improved government for our citizens. [Interjections.]
The new system of members' statements at the end of which Ministers have a
chance to respond has added a new, dynamic dimension to the interaction
between the executive and Parliament. I am aware that the system of
questions still needs to be refined, but it is fair to say that the system
we have gives an opportunity to all parties to ask the executive whatever
questions they want to, regardless of their size.

It must be acknowledged, however, that the number of unanswered questions
has substantially decreased from the levels seen earlier in the life of
this Parliament. The executive remains aware of the need to ensure that all
questions are answered at the end of each year.

I believe we have to constantly re-evaluate the effectiveness of
parliamentary questions and see how, in the spirit of parliamentary
oversight and executive accountability, the system can be improved.

I have no doubt that in the second decade of our freedom, this dynamic and
vibrant House will continue to grow from strength to strength. As said
earlier, the thread of partnership runs through our activities as a nation,
even more so with regard to rebuilding the moral fibre of our society.

The moral regeneration movement, a partnership between Government and civil
society, has been leading the national moral renewal effort since its
launch in April last year. We are delighted with the progress made so far.
In line with the holistic and intersectoral approach of the moral
regeneration movement, moral regeneration has become integral to the work
of government departments.

Some of the programmes implemented by government departments include,
amongst other things, the following: by the Department of Social
Development: promoting a caring society, building stronger family
structures and encouraging respect and assistance for the vulnerable
members of our society; by the Department of Correctional Services:
rehabilitation programmes for prisoners; by the Department of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology: the Ingoma Choral Project and a wide range
of initiatives promoting values through music, theatre and other
disciplines; by the Department of Health: promoting a healthy nation, and
care and support for people living with HIV/Aids, cancer, tuberculosis and
other illnesses through the Khomanani/Caring Together HIV/Aids programme;
by the Department of Communications: encouraging debate about the role that
the broadcast media and the advertising industry can play in building a new
value system, free of violence, stereotypes and other negative influences;
by the Department of Safety and Security: promoting and strengthening
partnerships with communities in building safer neighbourhoods; by the
Department of Justice: mobilising the community against violence directed
at women and children, and strengthening the courts to deal with such
cases; by the Department of Education: the Values in Education Project,
promoting good values from an early age; by the Department of Public
Service and Administration: promoting Batho Pele principles within the
Public Service; and by the Department of Foreign Affairs: promoting the
regeneration of Africa.

The moral regeneration movement is also working with other national
initiatives, for example with the Freedom Park Trust in cleansing and
healing ceremonies that seek to symbolically repair the soul of the nation.
These initiatives will assist the nation to come to terms with the legacy
of the colonial and apartheid systems, genocide, slavery, wars of
resistance and the struggles for liberation. The Government is leading this
process to deepen reconciliation and national unity.

Three such ceremonies have been held already - in the Eastern Cape, Free
State and Mpumalanga. This countrywide process will culminate with national
events on the Day of Reconciliation, 16 December.

The moral regeneration movement is also collaborating with the South
African chapter of the African Renaissance and the Indigenous Knowledge
Systems of South Africa in linking moral regeneration with the indigenous
knowledge project.

I have been heartened by renewal programmes that individuals and various
groups have initiated. I am sure that many in the country have been moved
by the campaign against the abuse of women and children by the group called
"Isililo: A Mother's Cry", led by, among others, our renowned opera and
Afro-jazz performer, Sibongile Khumalo.

Isililo was formed as a result of the brutal rape and murder of six-year-
old Lerato from Alexandra last year. Its objective is to remind women -
mothers in particular - that they must play a major role in providing the
moral fibre that holds families and communities together.

Another noteworthy initiative is the establishment of the Makeba Centre  for
Girls by our goodwill ambassador, Miriam Makeba.

The broadcast media often get criticised for espousing what is seen as
negative influences in programming. We must therefore acknowledge the
positive influence of programmes, such as All you need is love on SABC 1,
which promotes the strengthening of families as the rock upon which our
communities are founded. I hope more such programmes are being planned.

We would run out of time if I were to enumerate all the various initiatives
and programmes undertaken by South Africans to achieve moral renewal. We
encourage all initiatives of this nature. They give us hope.

We are most effective when we work together in partnerships when facing
challenges, especially those of the magnitude of HIV/Aids. As we all know,
there is still no cure for Aids, and it is our belief that our response to
the HIV/Aids epidemic must be holistic.

Our five-year strategic plan takes into account and focuses on prevention,
treatment, care, support and research. Although challenges remain, we are
beginning to see good results, as outlined recently by the Minister of
Health in both this House and the National Council of Provinces.

Having engaged various stakeholders as chairperson of the SA National Aids
Council, Sanac, I strongly believe that we have national consensus on the
National Strategic Plan for HIV/Aids. We may have some differences in
emphasis with regard to implementation by one or two sectors, but we all
agree on the need for a holistic response, as enunciated in the national
plan. It therefore becomes crucial that we engage each other regularly and
work together as various sectors to harmonise our response.

Sanac is fulfilling this role. It has completed its restructuring and has
become more representative of various sectors. The new membership of Sanac
includes representatives from labour, the faith-based sector, the SA
Business Coalition Against HIV and Aids, the hospitality sector,
traditional leadership, traditional healers, people living with Aids,
sport, disability, the Men's Forum, NGOs, the human and legal rights
sector, local government, higher education, financial institutions, women,
and the youth. The inaugural meeting of the new council is scheduled to
take place next month. The task ahead of us remains huge, and it is
important that we focus all our energies on an effective response to the
epidemic.

We believe in the need to address the root causes of conflict and in the
promotion of lasting peace and sustainable development in Africa, as part
of the regeneration of the continent.

We are, as members are aware, involved in a number of peace initiatives on
the continent, including Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and others, as the President has outlined.

As I previously reported to this House, Burundi is finally experiencing a
real possibility for peace after decades of turmoil. The peace process is
on track, and the changeover of power at the presidential level in April
indicated, once again, the resolve of the Burundi people to move forward.
The African mission in Burundi is also making good progress in its mission
of monitoring and assisting in the implementation of the ceasefire
agreements.

The preparation for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of
former combatants of the various armed groups is in progress. Restricting
combatants to assembly points is critical in preventing ceasefire
violations. The commitment displayed by the Burundi people makes us
confident that the second phase of the transition will go smoothly, leading
to democratic elections in just over a year.

This year has also seen us making progress in promoting multilingualism. As
hon members are aware, the National Language Policy Framework was launched
late last year. As a follow-up, a well-attended consultative conference was
held on 12 June focusing on implementation. We await the final report so
that we can move this process forward with urgency. We remain steadfast in
our commitment to the further development and enhancement of our indigenous
languages.
I said at the beginning of my address that we have much to be proud of in
the first nine years of our democracy. We have moved a long way to forge a
common nationhood, and all South Africans have good reason to be confident
about the bright future of this country.

We are pleased to see the optimism of the youth. The SA Reconciliation
Barometer has found, in results from an October 2002 national survey, that
eight out of 10 youths are confident about a happy future for all racial
groups in South Africa. [Applause.]

There are many other reasons why we can boldly proclaim that we are proud
to be South Africans. For example, over the past two years we have been
privileged to host two United Nations conferences, one on racism in Durban
in 2001 and the other on sustainable development in Johannesburg in 2002.

We also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup. The success of these events
further proved the technical prowess of our country. As members are aware,
we are competing with four other African countries for the right to host
the 2010 Soccer World Cup. We are confident of success and are aware of the
enthusiastic support of all South Africans for the bid. Certainly, the
situation has changed for the better since 1994 and continues to change.
[Applause.]

We have come this far and triumphed over adversity, because we have been
able to put our country first and because we continue to work together to
build a better South Africa. As we move towards the second decade of
freedom, let us continue to consolidate the gains we have made.

We will succeed as we have a clear vision of the kind of society we are
building together. Yes, the situation has changed for the better and will
continue to change. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS:  Deputy Speaker, it is an honour to follow the hon
Deputy President in this debate. His hard work in the best interests of
South Africa does not go by unnoticed.
Deputy Speaker, hon President, many happy returns of the day. Now according
to the stars of the hon President as reported in The Argus of this
afternoon, he should not worry about work today but should rather use the
opportunity to take time out. So if the President leaves now, we won't
blame him. [Laughter.]

Adjunkspeaker, die apostel Paulus skryf in een van sy briewe: ons is in
hierdie wêreld, maar nie van hierdie wêreld nie. Ongelukkig het talle Suid-
Afrikaners, veral die gemeenskap waaraan ek behoort, ook baie jare lank
gedink dat ons in Afrika is, maar nie van Afrika nie. Vandag besef die
meeste Suid-Afrikaners dat ons nie net in Afrika is nie, maar ook van
Afrika. Die enigste uitsondering is miskien die DA. Dit wil sê, as Allister
Sparks gelyk het in sy boek, Beyond the Miracle. Luister wat skryf hy:
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Deputy Speaker, the apostle Paul writes in one of his letters: We are in
this world, but not of this world. Unfortunately many South Africans,
particularly the community that I belong to, have also thought for many
years that we are in Africa, but not of Africa. Today many South Africans
realise that we are not only in Africa, but also of Africa. Now the only
exception is perhaps the DA. That is to say if Allister Sparks is correct
in his book Beyond the Miracle. Listen to what he writes:]


  Mbeki and Leon are diametric opposites. Mbeki is essentially African in
  seeing himself as part of a political community with a common purpose.
  Leon, by contrast, is essentially eurocentric, with not an ounce of
  emphathetic sensitivity to traditional African ways of debate and
  conflict resolution.

[Applause.]

Omdat die meeste van ons van Afrika is, spreek dit vanself dat Suid-Afrika
se lot onlosmaaklik verbind is met die lot van Afrika. Misluk Afrika, gaan
Suid-Afrika ook uiteindelik misluk, maar slaag Afrika, sal Suid-Afrika ook
slaag. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Because most of us are of Africa, it stands to
reason that South Africa's destiny is inextricably linked up with the
destiny of Africa. If Africa fails, South Africa will eventually also fail;
but if Africa succeeds, South Africa will also succeed. [Interjections.]]

If the 21st century is to belong to Africa as envisaged by the hon
President, the objectives of the African Union, as contained in Article 3
of the Constitutive Act, will have to be pursued relentlessly and Nepad
will have to bear fruit. The G8 countries recently pledged an additional
R60 billion for development aid in Africa. It would, however, be wrong for
Africa to depend solely on outside help for its development.

In an article in the June edition of New Africa it was suggested that
Africans should tap into the African way of life for their own upliftment.
"Sousou" as practised in Ghana and "stokvel" as practised in South Africa
are cited as examples in this article. In terms of these practices,
communities build capacity by contributing sums of money on a monthly basis
which is then given to a selected contributor at the end of the month. And
this practice should now be refined and utilised with regard to nations,
where every country contributes a periodic fixed sum for a big capacity-
building project in one country. The author flaunts the idea that instead
of going cap in hand, every African country should contribute $1 million a
month, for example, from export earnings. Thus, a total of $52 million a
month could be raised for capacity-building in a specific country. Now in
my view this is not a bad idea. It should be considered.

It was pointed out that rarely does the global media refer to a country's
foreign policy as a grand doctrine. Yet that is exactly what The Economist
did in its edition of 10 May. It describes South Africa's foreign policy as
the Mbeki Doctrine and in terms of this doctrine South Africa cannot impose
its will on others, but it can help to deal with instability in African
countries, by offering its resources and its leadership to bring rival
groups together and to keep things calm until an election is safely held.
In other words, the model of peace, power-sharing and reconciliation that
worked in South Africa a decade ago can be applied elsewhere. The Mbeki
Doctrine, so far, worked well in Burundi and the DRC.

Hopefully it will produce results in Zimbabwe, because Zimbabwe's
political, social and economic institutions are on the edge of collapsing,
leaving that country a failed state with devastating consequences, also for
South Africa. In the meantime, President Mugabe should take a hard look at
South Africa's history with a view to learning a thing or two. Even the
most harsh action taken by the former security forces could not stop the
advance of liberation movements to freedom. [Applause.]

With the weapons of mass destruction still at large in Iraq, each country,
including South Africa, should earnestly re-evaluate the effectiveness of
its intelligence services. The worst possible scenario for the United
States would be that Bush would lose the next election and Saddam Hussein
and Osama bin Laden pop up somewhere unscathed. [Laughter.]

Could the hon President inform the House what South Africa's relationship
is currently with Iraq? Do we still have official ties with the previous
regime? In other words, is the ambassador appointed by the Hussein regime
still executing his duties in South Africa, or have we suspended our ties
with Iraq until a new government is in place?

The UN Millennium Summit resolved to have the number of the world's poor
halved by 2050. Africa south of the Sahara needs growth of about 7%
annually to achieve this objective. It has further been estimated that the
economy needs to grow by 5% a year for South Africa to half its
unemployment rate from 30% to 15% during the next ten years. It is crystal
clear that with an economic growth rate of just 3% a year, we won't be able
to push back the frontiers of poverty. A thorough investigation by
Government, labour and business as to why the economy is not growing
sufficiently can no longer be postponed and the recommendations of such an
investigation should be applied fearlessly.

In reaction to Deputy President Zuma's remark that criminals should not be
able to hide behind the Constitution when they have violated the rights of
others, the Human Rights Commission suggested that an indaba be held to
decide how the rights of criminals should be weighed up against those of
victims of crime. I fully support this proposal. I am also convinced that
the time has come to reopen the debate on the death penalty in a
responsible manner.

Die toespraak van die agb President gedurende die debat oor die WVK se
finale verslag was 'n belangrike mylpaal op die pad van versoening in Suid-
Afrika. Sy skerp teenkanting teen die beplande eishofsake in die VSA teen
Suid-Afrikaanse maatskappye wat voordeel sou getrek het uit apartheid,
asook sy verwerping van 'n welvaartbelasting, sal ongetwyfeld binnelandse
beleggersvertroue versterk, wat weer 'n hupstoot sal wees vir ekonomiese
groei.
Die Nuwe NP doen 'n dringende beroep op alle Suid-Afrikaners om mildelik by
te dra tot die spesiale vrywillige vergoedingsfonds wat gestig gaan word om
slagoffers van apartheid te ondersteun en om verdere ontwikkeling te
stimuleer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The speech by the hon President during the debate on the final report of
the TRC was an important landmark on the road of reconciliation in South
Africa. His strong opposition to the planned claims court cases in the USA
against South African companies who were supposed to have profited by
apartheid, as well as his rejection of a wealth tax will undoubtedly
reinforce domestic investors' confidence, which will be a boost for
economic growth.

The New NP is urgently calling on all South Africans to contribute
generously to the special voluntary reparation fund that is going to be
established to support victims of apartheid and to stimulate further
development.]

Against the backdrop of reconciliation and amnesty, I have a special
request for the hon President. Kevin Woods, Michael Smith and Philip
Conjwayo, also known as the "Harare Three", are currently serving life
sentences in a Harare prison. They were recruited by the old SA Defence
Force working as undercover agents and operators in Zimbabwe. They fully
revealed their involvement with the previous government and defence force,
which perhaps qualifies them for the same amnesty dispensation that had
been negotiated at Kempton Park. All countries and states in Africa, I
believe, honoured the agreements at Kempton Park, except Zimbabwe. I was
part of a government that let these men down. All that I can do now is ask
the hon President to try to negotiate an amnesty deal for them. If amnesty
cannot be granted, a transfer to a South African prison would also be
appreciated. Kevin Woods has already served nearly 20 years in prison and
is, in any case, a dying man.

Om verder sigbare beslag te gee aan die proses van politieke versoening,
het die ANC en die Nuwe NP, wat mekaar bykans 90 jaar lank uit die
politieke loopgrawe uit beveg het, besluit om 'n samewerkingsooreenkoms te
sluit. In 'n gesamentlike verklaring wat deur die leiers van die twee
partye uitgereik is, word gesê:


  Dwarsdeur die 20ste eeu was ons politieke organisasies die hoofopponente
  in die stryd om die toekoms van die land te bepaal. In die 21ste eeu sal
  ons saamwerk om die nuwe, verenigde nie-rassige, nie-seksistiese,
  demokratiese en voorspoedige Suid-Afrika te help bou waartoe die
  oorweldigende meerderheid van ons mense verbind is.

Die Nuwe NP is entoesiasties daartoe verbind om van hierdie ooreenkoms 'n
sukses te maak, omdat dit 'n wenresep is vir Suid-Afrika en al sy mense.
Die Nuwe NP steun die begrotingspos. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[To give further visible effect to the process of political reconciliation
the ANC and the New NP, who have been fighting one another from the
political trenches for almost 90 years, have decided to come to an
agreement of co-operation. In a joint statement released by leaders of both
parties, it is said that:


  Throughout the 20th century our political organisations have been the
  main opponents in the struggle to determine the future of the country. In
  the 21st century we will co-operate to assist in building the new, united
  non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa to which
  the overwhelming majority of our people are committed.

The New NP is enthusiastically committed to making a success of this
agreement, because it is a winning recipe for South Africa and all its
people. The New NP supports the Budget Vote.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Happy birthday, Mr President. Deputy Speaker, I am going
to highlight some concerns that are raised by Christian churches and
organisations in our country today. I will start by quoting verbatim from a
recorded message given by Bishop Gaston Botwana, a friend of the director-
general, earlier this year. He said:


  I believe the struggle for liberation in South Africa was genuine.
  Political parties, whilst they were still freedom fighters forming
  themselves to fight against the apartheid regime, called on men of God
  and prophets of God. Meetings were held in churches, prayers were made to
  God in the name of South Africa. People cried tears, and blood was shed
  for the sake of the liberation of this country. There are things that our
  forefathers have said to God about the liberation of South Africa. They
  were speaking to God. They appealed to Him to help us and He did. Now we
  have forgotten Him. We want Him out of Parliament. We want Him out of our
  courts. We want Him out of our schools. We want Him out of society,
  because we think He was part of apartheid. We are like Jacob. God has
  blessed us. We are free now but we are not going back where we made a
  commitment. We are going to strange altars and strange gods. For as long
  as we do not go back to God, this country will continue to go down. God
  takes words seriously, especially when men of God are involved.


  If people call abefundisi to come and pray for us, to come and pray for
  the country, and the men of God come and call on the Lord their God and
  God hears them, and the leaders make promises, saying: When we are free
  we will serve you, Lord, then God will set you free. If you no longer
  serve Him, then nature, creation, heaven and earth will stand in judgment
  against you. This is the message that Christians must bring to South
  Africa because when I look at the history of our struggle, much praying
  was invested. Today we are free and people glorify themselves. They
  glorify their ancestors, their guns and the sanctions that took place as
  though God has done nothing.

Mr President, these are not my words. These are the words of Bishop Botwana
from Soweto. These words must be heeded by all South Africans who asked God
to help during the bad days of apartheid. We must not forget where we come
from, and all the promises we made to God when we were in trouble. This
Government will not solve all the problems of South Africa without His
assistance. Instead of legislating against Him, we must acknowledge Him in
all our ways so that He can ensure that we prosper.

We are aware of the debate that has started outside Parliament on whether
Christmas and Good Friday should continue being public holidays, as they
are religious holidays. Those that are saying that they must be done away
with, as Government is trying to ban prayers and morning devotions at
school, are misguided and going against the wishes of the majority of South
African voters. May I warn this House that any attempt by Government to
remove Christmas and Good Friday from our calendar will be political
suicide for the ANC. When this Government legalised abortion on demand,
they disregarded the wishes of the majority of our people and they got away
with it. When they abolished capital punishment they again ignored what the
majority of South Africans said and got away with it. If they again ignore
what the majority of our people say about the mentioned public holidays, Mr
Asmal, then they will not get away with their arrogance this time round.
Anyone who tries to remove the memory of Christ from the South African
calendar and history is making a very costly mistake. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, I am going to quote from the President's letter in ANC
Today, Volume 3, No 21 of 30 May to 5 June 2003, where he was responding to
Government critics on the arms deal - and I agree with the President that
our country needs facts and not boundless allegations. What was most
interesting to me in his letter was his reference to what he called the
Biblical Gospel according to St Matthew, where it is said:


  Jesus Christ saw Simon Peter and his brother Andrew fishing in the Sea of
  Galilee. He said to them to follow Him and He would make them fishers of
  men.

Taking a cue from this, the President concluded that:


  Some in our country have appointed themselves as fishers of corrupt men.

If any government commits itself to clean governance, transparency and anti-
corruption then they open themselves to scrutiny by both the public and the
media. Those who want to satisfy themselves that there was no backdoor
deals, personal gain or benefit or even corruption in the whole arms deal
process should be allowed to do so, without being called names like
``fishers of corrupt men''.

The ACDP will always support those who want the whole truth to come out. Mr
President, may God bless you on your birthday. [Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Hon Deputy Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy
President, members of the House, may I first take the opportunity to
congratulate the President on his birthday.

Mongameli, ngosuku lokuzalwa kwakho sithi: Mpilonhle, mpilonde! Ukhule uze
ukhokhobe! [Ihlombe.] [President, on your birthday we say: Long live, long
live! Live until you are old enough! [Applause.]]

Many hon members, when they stand in front of this House, claim to be
speaking on behalf of a specific group. If you analyse whom they say they
represent, it becomes clear that many of them claim to be speaking on
behalf of the same group. This in itself is not wrong; it is not even
ironic; it simply is the reality of who we are. What is ironic, however, is
that they all claim to be representing and speaking exclusively on behalf
of the very same people.

I would like to avoid this trap today and would much rather speak with a
group of people. Many in this House often define this group as the minority
- minority as determined primarily by race, and secondarily by language. I
am not going to try and define this group. In fact, I believe and would
argue that it is this very definition that marginalises this sector of our
society.

Daar is 'n doelbewuste beweging, fyn uitgewerk en strategies gefundeer, om
hierdie groep te laat glo dat hulle, as minderheid bedreig word en dat
hulle, as minderheid, gemeenskaplike, geregverdigde vrese het. Die
gewildste onder die meesters van hierdie vreestaktiek is misdaad. Bykans op
'n daaglikse basis, moet ons aanhoor dat die ANC-regering nie die wil het
om misdaad te bekamp nie, dat misdaad buite beheer is, dat
misdaadstatistiek bekend gemaak moet word, asof die bekendmaking van
misdaadstatistiek 'n einde aan misdaad gaan bring. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There is a deliberate movement, carefully worked out and strategically
based, to make this group believe that they, as a minority, are being
threatened and that they, as a minority, have justified fears in common.
The most popular amongst the masters of these fear tactics is crime. Almost
daily we have to hear that the ANC Government does not have the will to
combat crime, that crime is out of control, that crime statistics should be
disclosed, as if the disclosure of crime statistics would put an end to
crime.]
What are the facts about crime? What is fiction? The truth is that the ANC
Government, under the leadership of the President, has prioritised the
fight against crime as one of the country's national priorities. This is
reflected and embodied within the administrative structure of the
Presidency, through the director-general and in the Chief Directorates.
This inputs into government policies and strategies and forms an important
part of the Integrated Planning Framework. It is clear that, under
President Mbeki, crime is dealt with in a holistic manner.

The efforts of all the different Government agencies from Intelligence,
SAPS and Justice are co-ordinated and focused on having a lasting effect
and putting an end to crime.

An HON MEMBER: Where are the results?

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: There are numerous successes because of this approach.
[Interjections.] Luckily you are not ... [Interjections.] There are
numerous successes because of this approach and none more than the impact
that was made on transnational crime syndicates.

The success of the Scorpions is something no one is denying. But, when the
Scorpions was first established, it was received with a great deal of
skepticism and was, among other things, described as the palace guard.  For
the first time in South Africa's history, we have a President that has his
finger on the pulse of the fight against crime. He involves himself and,
through his involvement, takes co-responsibility for the situation.
[Applause.] This, Deputy Speaker, hon President, is fact. Fiction, Deputy
Speaker, is that this ANC Government is losing the fight against crime.
Fiction is that this ANC Government does not have the will to fight crime.
This, Madam Deputy Speaker, is fiction of the cheap kind.

Never before in South Africa has so much been done to fight crime, neither
in terms of spending, nor in terms of commitment. Fiction is that crime is
unique to South Africa and that it started only after the new dispensation
and under a black government.

The basis for our crime problem can be found in the eighties, when the old
regime was so preoccupied with oppressing the black uprising that they
failed to heed a significant shift in the patterns of crime throughout
Southern Africa. [Applause.] This was the time when organised crime
syndicates established themselves on the African continent. In 1987, the
Commissioner of Police's annual report indicated that the number of
vehicles smuggled across South Africa's borders increased by a staggering
22% in one year. It was said that this was due to the increased number of
vehicles on the street. Please!

The truth is that in those years the special branch was given the bulk of
the resources and all of the special training. Regular detectives were
ignored and even seconded to border duties, where they had to patrol
borders, not to fight crime, but to ensure that the ANC terrorists did not
cross our borders. This, Madam Deputy Speaker, is a fact. [Applause.]

While crime statistics represent for the opposition a propaganda tool,
another brick to throw at the incompetent black government, for the ANC,
they represent the reality of the seriousness of the responsibility we have
to fight crime and the commitment we need to succeed in doing so. You can
continue.

Bemors jou eie stoep. Ons fokus sal nie afgetrek word van die taak ter hand
nie. [Foul your own nest. Our focus will not be shifted from the task at
hand.]

We cannot allow that fear be used as a marginalising and paralysing tool in
the political agenda of some. For many years it was the fear that was
instilled in us that allowed us to be separated from one another. And it is
that same fear that still exists, latently within some of us, that denies
us the opportunity to become part of the wonderful building of the South
African nation. Fear is more than often a fear of the unknown. Sadly, this
fear represents how we were kept apart and, as such, remain in many ways
strangers to one another.

Getting to know one another is a wonderful and liberating experience. It
liberates you from your misconceptions, your fears and opens up to you the
fact that we share the same fears, we have the same dreams and
expectations.

Of jy Afrikaanssprekend, Zulu, Sotho, of Xhosa is, jy wil veilig wees in
jou omgewing; jy wil weet dat daar werkgeleenthede vir jou is. Jy wil graag
hê dat jou kind goeie onderwys ontvang. Jy wil 'n beter toekoms vir jou
kind hê as dié wat jy gehad het. Het dit nie nou tyd geword dat ons ons
vrese oorwin en klem lê op die gemeenskaplikhede wat ons deel nie? Breek
vry, besef dat jou mede-Suid-Afrikaners dieselfde behoeftes, verwagtinge,
vrese en vreugdes as jy het. Begin deel daarin. Reik uit en werk saam
daaraan om daarvan 'n werklikheid te maak.

In Die Stem is daar 'n strofe wat lui: "Ons sal lewe, ons sal sterwe, ons
vir jou, Suid-Afrika". Ek onthou, as kind wanneer dit gesing is, want dan
was dit asof dubbel soveel mense hulle aansluit wanneer daar by die versie
uitgekom word. Die passie en oorgawe, die ongelooflike lojaliteit om te kan
sterf vir jou land! Dit is tog die grootste opoffering wat elkeen kan doen.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Whether one is Afrikaans-speaking, Zulu, Sotho, or Xhosa, one wants to
feel safe in one's environment; one wants to know that there are job
opportunities for one. One would like one's child to receive a good
education. One wants one's child to have a better future than one had. Has
the time not come for us now to overcome our fears and emphasise the
commonalities that we share? Break away, realise that one's fellow South
Africans have the same needs, expectations, fears and joys as oneself.
Start sharing these. Reach out and work together to make this a reality.

In The call of South Africa there is a stanza that goes: "At thy will to
live or perish, O South Africa, dear land". I remember that when I was a
child and it was sung, it seemed as if double the number of people joined
in when we got to that verse. The passion and commitment, the unbelievable
loyalty to be able to die for one's country! That is surely the greatest
sacrifice anyone can make.]

I believe the challenge now is to live for our country. That is the most
difficult sacrifice to make. South Africa and her people need us now. It
needs all of our talents, our commitment, our love and our passion. We need
to live for our country. We need to live for South Africa. That is the
highest sacrifice that we can now make. And the question is: Are we living
for our country? What is that we are doing to build South Africa? What am I
doing to build South Africa? How am I involved in pushing back the
frontiers of poverty? [Interjections.] I am not talking about paying my
taxes, being a law-abiding citizen or going to work. Yes, those things are
important, but they are what is expected of me and everybody else as part
of being good citizens. I am talking about what it is that each and every
one of us is doing to keep this miracle democracy that came to us in 1994
alive and healthy.

Hierdie demokrasie wat nou in `n broeikas lê en van elkeen van ons se
optrede afhanklik is om dit aan die lewe te hou en te laat bly groei.

Wat doen ons om ons volwaardige plek in hierdie land, ons land, in te neem?
Deel jy jou talente? Is jy betrokke by die gemeenskap? Reik jy uit na mede-
Suid-Afrikaners wat steeds onbekend aan jou mag wees? Is jy trots om 'n
Suid-Afrikaner te wees? Daar is soveel om op trots te wees. Ek het gebars
van trots toe die President die besonderse Suid-Afrikaners in die galery
bekend stel. Hulle is deel van Suid-Afrika. Húlle het inderdaad die gety
laat omkeer. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This democracy that is now lying in an incubator and depends on the
actions of each one of us to keep it alive and to let it keep growing. What
do we do to fully take our place in this country, our country? Do you share
your talents? Are you involved in the community? Do you reach out to fellow
South Africans who may still be unknown to you? Are you proud of being a
South African? There is so much of which to be proud. I blossomed with
pride when the President announced the exceptional South Africans on the
gallery. They are part of South Africa, they have indeed turned the tide.
[Applause.]]

It cannot only be the President and the ANC Government that continuously
reaches out. I saw the President participate in the "volkspele" [folk
dances] on Monday and I want to tell him that many see this, appreciate it
and it warms their hearts with pride. [Applause.] You are indeed
everybody's President.

So ook moet die ATKV gelukgewens word met sy aksie op Jeugdag by die
Goudini Spa. Dit is aksies soos hierdie wat Suid-Afrikaners in staat stel
om oor kleur-, godsdiens- of politieke grense keen met mekaar die
gemeenskaplike te deel wat Suid-Afrikaners van vreemdelinge verander in
vriende.

Daar is ook die samewerkingsooreenkoms tussen die NG Kerk Randburg en die
arm swart VGK kerk by Orange Farm - 'n Geleentheid vir Afrikaners om deel
te wees van die herstel van die samelewing. 'n Geleentheid om te kan help
bou aan Suid-Afrika en aan sy mense.

Neels Jackson, in 'n onlangse rubriek in Beeld, maak die punt dat waar
witmense gewillig betrokke raak by reparasie, by die herstel van die
samelewing, dit nie net swart mense is wat voordeel daaruit trek nie, maar
dat daar vir witmense self ook 'n gevoel van genesing is.

Die tyd het aangebreek om te vra wat my rol kan wees en hoe ek betrokke kan
raak. Watter bydrae kan ek lewer om die grense van armoede terug te skuif?
Dit is jou reg; dit is ook jou voorreg. Daar is groot uitdagings vir kerke,
skole, die media, besighede en individue. Die georganiseerde samelewing het
ook 'n rol om te speel, 'n bemiddelende rol op die minste, om dit moontlik
te maak vir groepe om by mekaar te kan uitkom en om te kan bou.

S M Mofokeng, 'n Basotho-digter, het 'n toneelstuk geskryf waarin hy
fokusseer op die onmoontlikheid van volledig mens te wees as jy alleen is.
Die mens kan slegs mens wees, wat hy behoort te wees, as die hele
gemeenskap menslik is. Dit is die kern van ubuntu: 'n mens is 'n mens deur
ander mense. Antjie Krog het dié gedig in Afrikaans vertaal, en ek wil net
twee stukkies daaruit aanhaal:  Die gedig se naam is ``Senkatana'':
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Similarly the ATKV must also be congratulated on its action on Youth Day
at the Goudini Spa. It is actions like these that enable South Africans to
share with one another beyond the barriers of colour, religion or politics
that which we have in common that change South Africans from strangers into
friends.

There is also the co-operation agreement between the Dutch Reformed Church
in Randburg and the poor black VGK [United Reformed Church] in Orange Farm
- an opportunity for Afrikaners to become part of the restoration of
society, an opportunity to be able to help build South Africa and its
people.

In a recent column in Beeld Neels Jackson made the point that  where  whites
willingly get involved in reparation, in the restoration  of  society,  this
is not only to the advantage of black people  but  white  people  themselves
also experience a feeling of healing.

The time has come for me to ask what my role can be and how I can become
involved. What contribution can I make to push back the frontiers of
poverty? It is one's right; it is also one's privilege. There are huge
challenges for churches, schools, the media, businesses and individuals.
Organised society also has a role to play, a facilitating role at the very
least to make it possible for groups to be able to get together, to be able
to build.
S M Mofokeng, a Basotho poet, wrote a play in which he focused on the
impossibility of being a complete human being if one is alone. A human
being can be what he is meant to be only if the whole community is humane.
That is the essence of ubuntu: One is a human being through other human
beings. Antjie Krog translated this poem into Afrikaans and I would like to
quote just two extracts from it. The poem is entitled Senkatana:]


  ``waar is almal? waar is die oë van al die ander
  wat bewonderend saam met myne kan kyk na hierdie prag?
  waar is die gesigte van al die ander wat glimlag
  stilweg glimlag omdat hulle sien wat ek sien?"


  "geen blydskap is volmaak as `n mens alleen is nie
  vir vryheid is elkeen van ons geskape, dis ons reg
  elkeen van ons is geskape om met die ander te lewe
  om met mekaar bewonderend te kyk na die dinge wat ons bly maak
  om met mekaar verheug te wees, met mekaar te leef
  sonder mekaar is vryheid leeg
  is vryheid die bron van droefheid en trane
  is vryheid nie vryheid nie! maar `n pynlike band was gevange hou


   duisternis in die oortreffende trap
   duisternis wat in lig wandel
   droefheid in blydskap geklee
   gehuil in vreugde gehul
   honger te midde van groot weelderigheid"

Allister Sparks so eloquently puts it: "South Africa needs healing  and  for
this it  needs  a  lowering  of  voices  and  a  climate  of  restraint  and
constructive engagement to enable the different groups to find  one  another
and to build mutual trust ... " Something that the opposition  seems  unable
to grasp. [Interjections.]

I would like to invite that group who often are described as the minority
to break free from the mental shackles of minority. You do not need to be a
minority in your own country. You need not be sidelined. [Applause.] Not
now; not ever again. It was President Mbeki who said "... that we refuse to
accept that our Africanness shall be defined by our race, colour, gender or
historical origins." [Interjections.]

Breek vry en word deel van 'n trotse Suid-Afrikanisme waarin ons saam
vreugdes van ons verskeidenheid en die eendersheid van ons ooreenkomste kan
vier. Ek dank u. [Break away and become part of a proud South Africanism in
which we can celebrate the joys of our diversity and the sameness of our
similarities together. I thank you.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Hon President, best wishes on your birthday. We wish you the
best.

As we debate the Budget Vote of the Presidency, the centrepiece must be
executive accountability. In a telling editorial in January 2001, the Mail
and Guardian stated the following in respect of the arms deal probe:


  If the ability of the institutions of state to pursue the investigation
  is undermined, then the media and private citizens will conduct the
  probe. And do it we will. Like the leaders of the apartheid regime before
  them, the leaders of the ANC will find the truth will come out - if not
  now, then next week, in five years or even in 50 years time.

South Africa's ``Armsgate'', like Watergate, shows that the cover-up
attempts often prove even deadlier than the original crime. In recent weeks
the furore about the arms deal and its investigation has again dramatically
appeared on the agenda of this House. As was the case with the information
scandal in 1978, truth has a habit of biding its time. But the lesson of
history is that it cannot and will not be suppressed forever. It simply
won't go away, Mr. President. There is much that you need to explain.

The executive accountability of the Republic of South Africa vests in the
Presidency in terms of the Constitution. In addition and more materially,
you chaired the decision-makers in the Cabinet subcommittee that oversaw
the arms deals procurement. You are the key authority that made crucial
decisions in respect of the arms probe. You decided on the exclusion of the
Heath Special Investigating Unit in the probe in January 2001. You stand
centre-stage in the controversy that surrounds the editing of the JIT
report in accordance with section 4(6) of the Auditor-General's Act of 1995
- an editing process that took place before this report reached Parliament.
The Auditor-General is Parliament's agent and he is accountable to this
House. While it is entirely appropriate for the Auditor-General to clear up
why he failed to share with Scopa the fact that it was given misleading
evidence by Mr Chippy Shaik in October 2000, we have to hear the executive
side of this sorry saga.

The Auditor-General has stated in a recent release and in a recent report
in Business Day in respect of the changes, and I quote: ``The President did
not ask me to change anything.'' While the Auditor-General will account to
Parliament, the buck stops with you, Mr. President. You must account for
the article 4(6) consultation. You must explain exactly what transpired in
these interactions. You can answer for yourself, Mr. President. You do not
need the Auditor-General as an interlocutor. Did you or did you not ask the
Auditor-General to alter any aspect of the JIT report? Did you have any
meetings with the Office of the Auditor-General throughout the course of
this investigation? If so, when and what was discussed? You must explain,
Mr. President. You are constitutionally accountable to this House and to
the people of South Africa and you need to place your actions on record.

Aiming to account via ANC Today on the Internet is wholly inappropriate.
You must account in this House, not online. You must answer a number of
crucial questions in your capacity as the former chair of the Cabinet
subcommittee. Did you ever question or say no to any suggestion that came
from Mr Chippy Shaik who bizarrely acted as Cabinet Secretary on these
occasions despite having a clear conflict of interest? Did you ever probe
interventions by former Defence Minister Joe Modise, who was setting up an
array of defence industry-related businesses that would benefit directly
from the arms deal and its offsets in any of the Cabinet meetings during
the course of the procurement process? Did you ever query any of the
processes, structures or decisions where there were no clear procurement
policies or conflict of interest codes in place? Did you question the
inflated BAE/SAAB and other industrial participation proposals presented to
Cabinet? Did you question the symbolic submarine contract signature by the
late former Minister Joe Modise? Did you express concerns about the
affordability team's reports on risks in the context of the Minister of
Finance's clearly expressed concerns in not only one meeting?

May I remind you, hon President, there are members of this House - not Mr
Bruce, I am afraid - who have meticulously studied every Cabinet minute,
every contractual clause and subclause of this procurement and know exactly
what interventions were made in the discussions and what specific decisions
were taken by the Cabinet subcommittee on which dates. [Interjections.]

As we gather to debate your Budget Vote here today,  the  House  of  Commons
foreign affairs committee has heard  evidence  from  former  secretaries  of
state, the Rt Hon Robin Cook, MP and Clare Short, MP, in their inquiry  into
the decision to go to war  in  Iraq  and  are  preparing  extensive  further
hearings. Across the Atlantic alarm bells are also ringing for  those  whose
actions will be the subject of extensive  congressional  investigations  and
interrogations of the intelligence that informed the  Bush  administration's
decision to wage war on Iraq.

These are pivotal moments in which the executive comes face to face with
the legislature in seminal moments of accountability and they are thus
seminal moments of accountability whether it is in Whitehall, Washington or
Cape Town. Whether it is Whitehall, Washington or Cape Town, the name of
the game, Mr President, is executive accountability. Despite your damnedest
efforts to distort the simple principle of accountability by shrouding it
in the rhetoric of race with the aim of emasculating and delegitimising
criticism, South Africa's ``Armsgate'' remains a clean and clear question
of executive accountability. Any suggestion that legitimate criticism of
the executive is racially inspired and subversive is itself a subversion of
the multiracial democracy under construction in this country.

Since gathering here to debate the state of the nation address, the litany
of former Cabinet Ministers and current Cabinet incumbents who have found
themselves either under criminal investigation or in an embarrassing
conflict of interest situation has grown. To the already impressive list of
former Ministers Maharaj, Modise and Naidoo and the current Deputy
President Jacob Zuma, we now need to add Ministers Lekota and Mufamadi and
Premier Stofile as the oil slick has rapidly replaced the arms deal
quagmire. While Parliament has acted against Minister Lekota, as head of
state, hon President, you have legal duties to exercise in terms of the
executive ethics Act. If you fail to do so, you yourself may be in breach
of the law. When will you act, Mr President? The buck in this regard also
stops with you.

South Africa's Arms gate now has to compete for column space with another
disastrous scandal threatening to engulf the Presidency - the Nigerian oil
deal. Here too the question is one of executive accountability - a familiar
concept. You need to explain what role the Presidency and the Government
played in lobbying the Nigerian government for the oil deal. The South
African oil company is abundantly clearly not a government entity under a
government-to-government contract.

Mr President, you have to release all correspondence between the Presidency
and the office of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and any
correspondence with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company as a matter of
great urgency and public importance. The Nigerian oil scandal is yet
another cloud of suspicion hanging ominously over this Government and must
be cleared up without any delay. In respect of both the arms deal and the
oil deal scandals, the crucial unanswered question is whether the ANC as a
party received any funding from any winning bidders in respect of the arms
deal or any contributions from the South African oil company in respect of
the oil deal. You are not only the President of the ANC. As President of
this country, you are accountable to us all. You owe Parliament and the
people of South Africa answers to these crucial and critical questions.
[Interjections.]  That is what open and transparent government is all
about. [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members,  allow  me  first  to
wish the hon President a happy birthday.

Turning to the Budget Vote before us, we unfortunately see little to be
happy about. Despite millions being spent on policy development, for
instance on the economy, no actual development takes place. Instead we are
assured, year in and year out, that policy is cast in stone and with it the
unemployment and poverty that it perpetrates. The hon President has assured
us that corruption is a priority, but woe betide the person who raises the
issue. The hon President is eager to remind us that he is an African, and
those who expose corruption or query questionable government behaviour are
inherently anti-African. It is about being in a position of power and trust
and living up to that responsibility.

This Budget Vote provides in excess of R27 million for policy co-
ordination, the National Youth Commission and a Minister in the Presidency.
The UDM believes that these functions are not producing tangible results.
The latter two should be scrapped and the former reduced, and this funding
should be allocated to a new department specifically tasked with small
business development. Further funding is available in the Umsobomvu Fund
and in the budget of the Department of Trade and Industry and its agencies
Khula and Ntsika. Such a new department of small business can focus
specifically on creating employment opportunities for the youth and women
who constitute the majority of the unemployed. It would be a much more
productive application of taxpayers' money to address the single biggest
challenge facing this country - the unemployment crisis.

This is but one example of how the Government can make a tangible
difference to the lives of ordinary South Africans. It is a question of
political will. Government must do more. It is an unfortunate feature of
this Presidency that it is associated with hundreds of millions of
taxpayers' rands being spent on foreign trips and large summits that change
nothing, not with the suffering that we have in virtually every South
African neighbourhood.

The UDM, however, supports the Budget Vote. I thank you.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Madam Deputy Speaker, Comrade President,
Comrade Deputy President, hon members, however unwelcome the passing years
might be to all of us, we are once again able in this debate to offer
President Thabo Mbeki our warmest birthday wishes on reaching another
milestone. And the same to you, Deputy President, although your birthday
was earlier.
As we approach the 10th anniversary of our democracy, it is worth noting
how far the building blocks of progressive statehood have been put in
place. Things are vastly better and those South Africans small in mind and
numbers who wish to hark back to the old days should appreciate their luck
in sharing in one of the world's recognised democracies, which is forging
ahead, instead of living in a country which a former editor of Die Burger
described as the ``polecat of the world''.

This harking back increasingly rears its head as some fire their first
election campaign salvos. For example, last Sunday the Leader of the
Official Opposition got onto a podium and made claims regarding what he
termed too high a cost for the President's security. I need not deal with
the gross anomalies in his so-called facts. He himself must calculate
whether the vast amounts he pays researchers are worth it, in this case, to
feed him misinformation regarding the Johannesburg metro police budget.

A basic misreading of a speech by the Johannesburg mayor, it seems, led the
hon member to proclaim that the total budget of the metro police for 2003-
04 is only R14 million, when indeed this budget is over R400 million, after
a 22% increase on the previous year. Even a cursory reading of the mayor's
speech shows that the mayor merely indicated that as part of this 22%
increase, R14 million is allocated and set aside for capacity-building for
metro police officers. The issue is the security of the President of the
Republic. To compromise on this in the least, I would argue, would be to
undermine the stability we sought to build since 1994.

The Leader of the Official Opposition may wish to hog the headlines on any
issue, as is his wont, but I do not think he seriously would like our
Government to compromise the security of his President, our President. The
question is: Is the life of a black president less valuable than even that
of former apartheid presidents? [Applause.]

Despite these efforts to hark back and misinform, there are everywhere firm
signs of progress. The tide has turned. Let me give a few instances of
integrated and interactive governance led by the Presidency. The Imbizo
programme, as the President outlined in this House on 5 June ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon Minister, there seems to be a point
of order.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Just on a point of order, Madam
Deputy Speaker: The running commentary from the side of the Leader of the
Opposition actually is an interruption to the member speaking, and
therefore that shouldn't be allowed. Secondly, he also deserves to treat us
in this House with some degree of respect. Thank you.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon member, let me just respond. On the
issue of commentary, of course, heckling is something that is allowed.
However, hon members, please let's not have a running commentary, because
heckling is different from a running commentary. A running commentary is
obstructive and in fact prevents us from really following what the speaker
is saying. But, of course, it's acceptable to me that there is heckling
here and there. That's something that is acceptable. So, may I please ask
hon members to just bear with us and respect this particular debate.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Since 2001, no fewer than five provinces
have had this special attention by the President and four by the Deputy
President. Ministers, Deputy Ministers, premiers, provincial MECs, mayors
and local councillors have played their part too, including in four
national focus weeks, not to speak of provincial executive outreach
programmes. It has indeed become a way of life for this Government.

I believe the real effect of this imbizo way of life is still to be fully
understood and will form part of many a postgraduate study and research
topic regarding communications and governance in the years to come. One has
but to see the enthusiasm of our people when presented the opportunity to
interact with and directly question our President and Deputy President or
others in the executive. Our people seem to more eagerly speak their minds
and raise difficult issues.

Things happen when people and Government interact directly that we do not
see anywhere else, whether in political meetings or at conferences. The
Presidency has a good tendency, sometimes, to respond and intervene on the
spot. Recently, in the North West, to the consternation of his security
contingent, Rev Chikane and myself, he jumped from the stage in response to
a speaker living with HIV who had been struggling to meet his MEC on
HIV/Aids issues. There in the hall, while the imbizo was proceeding, he
brought the MEC and this person together and had the MEC agree to a
meeting. That meeting has already taken place and the issues are being
resolved. [Applause.]

Equally, the young man who said to the President at another imbizo in the
North West, ``We need projects; we have hands, we can do it ourselves'',
was expressing sentiments heard over and over again at Imbizo, as a
people's contract for development takes shape in the spirit of Vukuzenzele
and Letsema. The success of Imbizo and its rapid growth means that we as
Government will have to increasingly deal with the issues raised and the
resulting action required. The working and advisory groups set up by the
Presidency covering, for instance, big business, organised labour, black
business, commercial agriculture, international investment and religious
communities are now part of the routine back-up for executive governance in
an interactive democratic setting. Indeed, they are another aspect of
Imbizo.

Recently we officially launched the first Nepad cultural project between
South Africa and Mali, which stems from the President's state visit to Mali
and commitments he made there last year. The South Africa-Mali-Timbuktu
project is looking at ways in which to ensure that this rich part of the
history of our continent and its principles and its peoples remains intact
for our children and future generations.

Hon members, there is an unwritten convention in a number of countries that
the leading figures of the executive, as well as leading figures in the
opposition, when travelling abroad, do not deliberately, wilfully and
shamelessly undermine their own country. What is worse is when the Leader
of the Official Opposition, the hon Mr Tony Leon, actually parades lies and
distortions as political analysis. Here are some of the comments this hon
member made at a conference in Mexico in April 2003. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon Minister.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon Minister knows that he's
breaching the Rules of the House when he comes with unparliamentary
statements like that, and I ask you to instruct him to withdraw that
comment.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, would you please withdraw?

The MINISTER IN THE  PRESIDENCY:  I  withdraw  and  say  that  he  was  very
economical with the truth. Here are some ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, please just withdraw.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: I have withdrawn that statement, Madam
Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Fine.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: But it's parliamentary to say ``economical
with the truth''.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, hon member.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY:  Here are some of the comments this hon
member made at the conference in Mexico in April 2003. After hearing what
he said, I invite this House to make up its own mind. This is what he said:


  The overwhelming majority of South Africans say that they are unhappy
  with the way the country is governed.

That's what he says.


  The future of the DA will depend on the success of its efforts ...

That is, to eat into the support of the ANC. And then he goes on and says:


  ... and we are making rapid progress.

Then, talking about those who have crossed the floor - not to his party, to
the ANC - he says:


  Many of the ANC's new cheerleaders, by their own admission, are keen to
  ride the Government gravy train.

Then he says:


  But, for now, the South African democracy is looking fragile. The ANC now
  possesses, without the aid of its coalition partners, a two-thirds
  majority in the National Assembly. This means it has the power to amend
  the Constitution at will ...

He doesn't know the Constitution -


  ... in addition, in passing any laws it likes. If the courts declare
  legislation unconstitutional, well, then the ANC can simply change the
  Constitution.

This is what he says.


  It is, in short, colonising the Constitution's checks and balances.

He then goes on:


  The ANC is now more centralised and hierarchical than ever before,
  complacent about its constituents' concerns and hyperactive in extending
  its reach into every area of state.

He says:


  Today the ANC tolerates the idea of political opposition, but insists
  that opposition outside the orbit of the ruling party is illegitimate.
  The ANC wants to select and control its political interlocutors.

I don't know if this is unparliamentary, and if it is, I'll withdraw it,
but this is dishonourable, hon Leader of the Official Opposition.

Regarding the rights of children, gender equality and women's empowerment,
the concerns of people with disabilities and the youth, we have
significantly moved forward and are ready to face the remaining challenges.
[Interjections.] Fortunately I don't have my hearing aid, so I can't hear
you. Government recently adopted a policy framework for a National Youth
Service Programme and the implementation plan will soon go to Cabinet for
approval. The very positive response Government departments have given will
ensure that the National Youth Service Programme is implemented as part of
ongoing interventions to roll back the frontiers of poverty.

The National Youth Service Programme will play a catalytic role in
enhancing the skills of our youth while they are involved in community
development initiatives and other programmes. The Growth and Development
Summit is committed to 72 000 learnerships by 2005, 95% of which are to be
under the age of 35. GDS commitments around the extended public works
programme will increasingly benefit young people. In 2001 and 2002, 15% of
the beneficiaries of the community-based Public Works and the Working for
Water programmes were young people. The National Youth Commission further
strengthened the partnership for the Umsobomvu Youth Fund and the South
African Youth Council. This troika interacts with Government at all levels
to provide ideas and better co-ordination for interventions to benefit our
young people.

The Office on the Status of Women continues to put women's empowerment and
gender equality foremost on Government's agenda. As part of ongoing work
with the Nepad Secretariat, the OSW and the Nepad Secretariat cohosted a
gender and Nepad conference in April this year.

Recently, we launched the South African panel for the African Gender and
Development Index. South Africa is one of thirteen countries piloting this
initiative of the UN Economic Commission in Africa. It will establish a
baseline across Africa against which we can measure advances and identify
areas for intervention.

The gender machinery convened regular consultative meetings in the past
year, promoting co-ordinated responses by all, as in last year's very
successful 16-day campaign of no violence against women and children.

Similarly, the OSW and other gender structures will constructively engage
in the processes towards the 10-year celebration when they convene in
August to initiate a broad-based conversation amongst women, ``Towards ten
years of freedom: What it has meant to women''. The first three-year
training programme run by the OSW with the UN Economic Commission on Africa
and the UNDP concluded last month. The University of Pretoria now accredits
this as a certificate course, and the OSW has initiated development of a
training manual on gender issues for Samdi to incorporate into public
servant training modules.

Although our co-ordination framework is in place, we have not yet met all
our targets for representation of women at all levels of Public Service
employment. In terms of the 30% target for women employed at management
level we set ourselves in 1995, the figures at the end of 2002 indicate
that we have not yet reached this, and there is a 6% gap to breach before
we reach this target. Government is committed to ensuring that this
happens. Ensuring that the private sector mirrors these employment equity
commitments remains a major challenge.

On this point, Comrade President and Comrade Deputy President, look at your
ANC benches in this House, and you will see represented here in front of us
the diverse nation that we are, including a more representative gender
balance.

Hon MEMBERS: Yes!

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Look to my left. All I see is a collection
of pale, male faces. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] Surely we need to do
something to more accurately reflect, in these ranks, the race, class and
gender diversity of our nation. [Interjections.]

The ANC has a minimum of one third women representatives. The Official
Opposition seems woefully backward on this question. [Interjections.]
Comrade Lulu, should the relevant portfolio committee not consider making
this minimum one-third representation of women a statutory obligation for
all parties who wish to be represented in this House? [Applause.]

The Office on the Status of Disabled Persons continues to co-ordinate the
Integrated National Disability Strategy. In the past year, the office
further enhanced Government capacity by training officials and providing
advice on integrating disability into mainstream society. As with the OSW,
Samdi will ultimately take over the responsibility for training trainers to
integrate disability in all Samdi curricula.

The recent African regional consultation made decisions on implementing
strategic plans for the African Decade for the Disabled. South Africa has
been requested to host the secretariat for the African Decade, and we
expect it to be functioning by August or September this year. We have
confirmed donor funding for the secretariat and for the initial roll-out of
the decade plans. South Africa's contribution to the development of a UN
convention on rights of disabled persons is well established and continues.

With the assistance of Flemish government funding, the OSDP will roll out a
public awareness campaign in the coming months. As with gender equity, we
must work harder to reach the target of 2% of people with disabilities
employed in the Public Service over the next two years. Figures at the end
of 2002 indicate that we have a 1,99% gap to breach before we are there.
Important also is to ensure that, in breaching this gap, people with
disabilities are also employed at management level.

The Office on the Rights of the Child was established with a mandate to
monitor implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by
ensuring that our Government structures advance the interests of children.
Stakeholders are currently considering a draft of our second country report
to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.

South Africa's participation at the UN General Assembly Special Session for
Children last year saw our renewed commitment to ensuring that what is
outlined in the document ``Building a world fit for children'' is
implemented in our country over the next decade.
Whilst legislation helps realise the rights of the child, the ORC and its
partners in the national programme of action are mindful of the need for
effective implementation. In this respect, 29 sexual offences courts, five
one-stop multidisciplinary centres and 64 victim-friendly facilities have
already been established. There has been extensive collaboration and
partnership with the nongovernmental sector and structures working with
children.

To help deal with the rape of children, the CSIR, in partnership with the
ORC and Government departments, developed a website to capture information
from volunteers. This will enhance the service to abused children, matching
volunteer skills to needs of organisations. The Child Volunteer Network,
which is supported by the joint monitoring committee in this House, was
launched in October 2002.

Although much has been done to improve the lives of children, many
challenges remain. One of the main challenges is the need to mainstream
children's rights. This requires that we design programmes, practices and
responses based on the premise that the child is the most important factor.
In line with this, the ORC and its partners are looking at how to
strengthen the national programme of action, provincial programmes of
action, and ensure that every local and district council develops a
programme of action for children. Indeed, for all these vulnerable groups,
steady progress has been made.

While challenges remain, we can confidently say that as we move towards
2004, South Africa is an infinitely better place today than it was before.

All instant analysts are in danger of oversimplifying the short-term and
underrating longer-term trends. South Africa should take this advice to
heart, and I make no apology for developing ideas I raised in this debate a
year ago: If we look at the broad sweep of history, we will be vastly
buoyed by what we see. We see an average real growth rate for one-and-a-
half decades of around 1,5%. That is from 1976 to 1992. Then it was a
percentage more for 1993 to 1999. In the past two years, it has been around
3%. Even if the current figure, under global pressure, falls back to 2,5%,
this in no sense negates the medium and long-term improvement, one that
measures well against global trends.

We see real per capita income increasing by 3,3%, cumulatively from 2000 to
2002, up from the 2,2% from 1994 to 1999. The point is: Let us look at the
longer-term trends, and let us not look simply at cash wages, but at the
whole spectrum, including the social wage, which underpins the poor and has
helped to boost the living conditions of very many South Africans.

Of course, there are major pools of poverty and underdevelopment. Of
course, there is a revolution of rising expectations that prompts people
who now have a house instead of a shack to demand a proper ceiling, good
construction, security, and so on. Naturally in life success breeds new
expectations.

You find the opposition would be upset by that, because they are not going
to succeed in 2004, and I am afraid many pale male faces are going to be
looking for new jobs. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

What we had was the Leader of the Opposition castigating the President on
Zimbabwe. Let me ask him a question, and he must answer it. More than two
million people died in the DRC. More than one million died in Rwanda. More
than half a million died in Burundi. More than a million have died in
Angola because of an army that he supported. The hon Leon has never said
anything about that in this Parliament. [Applause.] [Interjections.] Indeed
...

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon Minister is
misleading Parliament. Can I appeal to you, under Rule 69(1) of this House
that, if a member such as the hon Minister misleads Parliament, an
explanation during debate is allowed only when a material part of a
member's speech has been misquoted or misunderstood.

The hon Minister has done precisely that. I have actually addressed
Parliament on the issues that he has raised, and he is therefore misleading
Parliament. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! [Interjections.]

I would like to address the hon Leon. Hon members, please take your seats.
Hon Minister, please take your seat.

Hon Leon says that what the hon Minister is saying is inaccurate, because
he has addressed Parliament on those matters. It might well be that he has.
I would like the Minister to consider withdrawing saying that he did not
... [Interjections.] Order!

Hon Minister, if you are not prepared to withdraw, that is fine. I would
like to check the Hansard about whether the hon Leon has in fact addressed
the House on those matters or not. Then I will make a ruling on that.
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, we don't have a
problem with your ruling, with the exception of one thing.

We respect your ruling, but in respect of the Leader of the Opposition
laying an allegation or accusation that the hon Minister in the Presidency
is misleading the House, that on its own requires a substantive motion for
him or anyone on his part to do that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Chief Whip, I will make a ruling that will include
that particular issue, because one of them will have misled the House.
[Interjections.]

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Indeed, the hon Mr Leon is obsessed with
Zimbabwe because, in his view, the most negatively affected people are
whites. [Interjections.] That is why he is so obsessed with this issue.
[Applause.]

Regarding the hon Taljaard, the days of white schoolmistresses are over!
[Laughter.] Why do you stand here and talk to your President as if he were
in a classroom? [Interjections.] If there are questions to answer, you
people must answer the question, in my view, why you consistently raise
matters which are not pertinent to many of the debates that take place in
this Parliament. [Interjections.] If I were the hon Gibson, I would try to
go for another operation. It might help. [Interjections.]

With these challenges that we have, let us as a nation put shoulder to the
wheel, and do something to ensure that the disempowered are equipped to
secure their share of what South African democracy has to offer, to secure
their pensions and child support grants, to visit their health care
facilities that are now there, to access the care now available for
HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other opportunistic infections, and at
all times to put pressure on their public representatives - that's me and
you - to do more for the people.

In less than a year, the nation will celebrate ten years of freedom. The
date 27 April 2004 will be both celebration and dedication; celebrating the
end, a decade ago, of many years of repression and super-exploitation of
labour power, and dedicating our nation to rising to greater heights.

As we move towards this important point in our evolving history, let us
together build our nation and find common answers to our challenges. The
preparations are under way, and we call on all groups, institutions and
individuals in the land to collaborate to ensure that this milestone
contributes to the future wellbeing of a united nation; indeed, to make it
a national celebration.

We need, in the way we mark this historic birthday, to draw on the immense
creativity of our people. We should honour the children born not in
bondage, but in freedom, since 27 April 1994. They are harbingers of our
hopes for the future. We wish to share our national joy and sense of
achievement with others from other countries, particularly those who
contributed so much to our liberation. We want to pause next year and
reflect so that we can move forward, like our Everest mountaineers, our
polar explorers and winners of the Comrades Marathon, to the continuing
challenges that present themselves. All members of this House are part of
this great process. All members will have something to offer.

My thanks and appreciation go to the Joint Monitoring Committee on the
Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women and the Joint Monitoring
Committee on the Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Children,
Youth and Disabled Persons. It has been a pleasure working with these
committees and their chairpersons. Similarly, it has been a pleasure to
work with the chairpersons, commissioners and staff of the National Youth
Commission during the past year.

My deepest appreciation and gratitude is for the work and commitment of the
Director-General in the Presidency, the advisers of the President, the
advisers of the Deputy President, my own adviser, specifically, and staff
in the Presidency in general.

Comrade President, you are a credit to this House. You are a credit to the
ANC. You are a credit to the country. But, above all, you are a credit to
those who have nourished you and continue to sustain you - the masses of
our people. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Madam Deputy Speaker, today is President Mbeki's birthday.
Congratulations. "Time flies or goes", they say. Exactly a year ago we had
the same debate in this House. I am convinced that it is wrong to say,
"Time goes". Time does not go, it stays. We go. A wise man said, "Old age
is always 15 years older than you are." Luckily there are still many years
for both of us before old age, Sir.

According to some political commentators, two factors are causing all the
problems in Africa, diversity and refusal to tolerate dissent. Kenny wrote:


  Traditional African Civilisation is in several ways superior to modern
  Western Civilisation, but the curse of Africa is the refusal to tolerate
  variety and dissent.

South Africa is a diverse country. Does that predict only problems for us?
Is diversity a curse or a blessing? I believe that it is a blessing. Let me
give you an example of our diversity.

I live in the North West province. I wish I could speak Setswana well. The
other day I listened to two Setswana speakers joking about Afrikaners. The
one said:


  When the Batswana people stand alongside a road and ask a motorist for a
  lift, they ask the motorist with a pointed finger to come and stop right
  here, not in front of the other hitchhikers.

He then told his friend:


  You know, Afrikaners are different and a little stupid. When they stand
  next to me asking for a lift they do not say come and stop here. They
  wave their thumb and say, ``I want a lift, but pass me and pick up the
  other guy on the other side.''

[Laughter.] Then the two of them had a good laugh. Sir, even the way we ask
for a lift is an example of our diversity.

In 1995 the Government had a newspaper advertisement explaining the
problems of writing a Constitution for a diverse society. The advert read,
"South Africa, 20 million women, 8 main religions, 25 main church groups,
31 cultural groups, 14 languages, etc."

For the peaceful future of South Africa and for Africa, one of the most
important challenges is to get the recipe and balance right in addressing
the problems of diversity. Up to now, we have failed.

If the aim of the former OAU for the last 40 years was to fight
colonialism, then it was a success. But if the aim of the former OAU for
the last 40 years was to democratise Africa and to promote human rights,
then the OAU was a dismal failure.

Here is just one statistic: in 1990 after almost 30 years of the OAU, of
the 53 African states, only nine could have been described as multiparty
democracies. The positive statistic is that this changed drastically in the
last 10 years. Today 39 states can be called democracies, but just remember
that one of them is Zimbabwe with all its problems.

President Mbeki said in his speech to launch the new African Union last
year in Durban:


  Through actions, let us proclaim to the world that this is a continent of
  democracy, a continent of democratic institutions and culture; indeed, a
  continent of good governance where the people participate and the rule of
  law is upheld.

Sir, if I look at the realities of Africa today, I must conclude from
President Mbeki's quote that he is an idealist and dreamer, and so am I. I
am also an idealist and a dreamer. If I were not an idealist and a dreamer,
I would not have been in this Parliament enduring the daily frustrations of
being a political leader.

If the President and I were not idealists, most probably we would have been
in the private sector earning double our present salaries or maybe the two
of us would have been professors at some university debating each other on
western economic theories and their applicability in Africa.

Robert Kennedy said, "Some men see things and say why. I dream things and
say, why not." Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. said, "You ought to believe
something in life, believe that thing so passionately that you will stand
up with it to the end of your days." For an idealist to be successful,
there is also a qualification.

At the death of the first Israeli president, Chaim Weizmanh, Scott wrote a
tribute and he said, "He commanded the two essentials of genuine
statesmanship, that rare combination of the idealistic and the severely
practical."

We may dream, but if we are not severely practical in our solutions for
South Africa and Africa then we shall fail. Simplistic Westminster and
British political models will not work in Africa. They tend to simplify
politics to individual citizens that must be moulded into a nation.

I am not only an individual, but I am also a part of a community. Ignoring
the fact that all African countries consist of individuals and different
communities is one of the reasons why Africa is still struggling to get
real political stability.

The writer Greer said of the English in London, "Even crushed against his
brother in the tube, the average Englishman pretends desperately that he is
alone." Most Afrikaners and Africans are not like that. We are community
people.
At this moment, the solution that is prescribed for African countries with
problems is to form a government of national unity and to send a peace
force to protect this solution. My experience is that this is never a
permanent solution. It is always only a transitional solution. At the
University of the Western Cape, President Mbeki said, "Peacekeeping is not
good. It freezes conflict; rather conflict must in the end be prevented."

Sir, the FF believes that prevention in Africa is to develop political
systems that accommodate diversity, ones that accommodate different
communities. Westminster's simplistic solutions always ignore diversity,
ignore communities, and try to assimilate instead of to accommodate.

As Afrikaners, we often hear that we must not see ourselves as a minority,
but must become part of the majority. Why do I have a problem with this?
Because, to become part of the majority, a minority must first abandon
everything that is important to them and that made them a distinct minority
in the first place. That is assimilation and not accommodation.

What frustrates me is that when we argue this, ANC members always hear
apartheid and racism and then no further debate is possible. There was no
apartheid in Rwanda, Burundi or the DRC, but we argue exactly the same
arguments and the same facts when we argue about these countries.

Even when we debate Africa's poverty problems, the FF believes the solution
cannot come from Government and big business. They may contribute, but can
never solve these problems on their own. The solution is to empower
communities to uplift themselves to become increasingly self-reliant. I
would like to invite the President to accompany me to see an example of
where this solution is successfully applied within a community.

Meneer, hoeveel keer moet ek nog die Afrikaner se vaardighede en ervaring
aanbied om te help met die oplos van ons probleme? Maar natuurlik nie
onvoorwaardelik nie. Danksy regstellende optrede, kry Afrikaners die
boodskap dat hulle 'n probleem is, en dit is 'n ander boodskap as Juffrou
van Wyk s'n.

In 'n onlangse navorsingsprojek by Eskom is bevind dat 55% Afrikaners
vervreemd voel; vreemdelinge in hulle eie land. Sewe en sewentig persent
voel daar is nie vir hulle hoop op bevordering nie, omdat hulle Afrikaners
is. As jy gelukkig is, verwag jy dat jy jou werk kan behou, op voorwaarde
dat jy ander moet oplei om jou werk uiteindelik by jou te kan oorneem. As
die vereistes is dat ons, as gemeenskap, moet selfmoord pleeg, het ek 'n
verrassing vir hulle.  (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Sir, how many more times must I offer the Afrikaner's skills and
experience to assist with the solution of our problems? But of course, not
unconditionally. Due to affirmative action, Afrikaners receive the message
that they are a problem, and this is a different message to that of Miss
Van Wyk.

In a recent research project at Eskom it was found that 55% of Afrikaners
feel alienated; strangers in their own country. Seventy-seven per cent feel
that there is no hope of promotion for them, because they are Afrikaners.
If one is fortunate, one expects to be able to retain one's job, on
condition that one trains others to eventually be able to take over one's
work. If the requirements are that we, as a community, should commit
suicide, I have a surprise for them.]

Sir, how do we address these problems? We recently had good discussions
with the President on some of these issues. We proposed positive solutions.
But Sir, I must report to you that there was no real progress. It
frustrates me because there was so much goodwill in our executive council
when we took the decision. I have my dreams for Afrikaners and for South
Africa, and the President has his.

Robert Goddard, the father of the  American  space  programme  said,  "Every
dream is a joke, until the first man accomplishes it." I would rather  reach
old age as an idealist that dreamt and tried, than  as  a  cynic  that  only
criticised. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Deputy Speaker, his Excellency  the  President,  may  I
also congratulate you on your birthday.

As we are about to vote for the Presidency budget, we are reminded to
interrogate the activities of the Office of the Presidency, the activities
of this highest office as informed by policy direction that the Presidency
has adopted. It is on this basis of the policy course chosen that the
resources allocated to this office are also justified in advancing the
interests of South Africa, rebuilding Africa, and contributing to the
achievement of global stability and peace.

e simply think that the President is preoccupied with matters outside the
country, which is in keeping with what is happening today. There is no
doubt that the President, together with other African leaders, has managed
to firmly put Africa on the world agenda. Much cannot be said about
addressing pressing local challenges, such as the issue of the economy that
is not growing as expected, resulting in businesses shutting down, job
losses, and unemployment. The other challenges relate to poverty
alleviation, HIV/Aids, and issues of traditional leadership.

We are not convinced that the President does not have the capacity to
address these issues that are very close to the hearts and minds of South
Africans. We say that charity begins at home, Mr President. Let us first
clean our own house before we start throwing stones.

The perception among ordinary South Africans is that our President does not
care nor has the time to listen to their cries. This is a reality we cannot
simply ignore. It is informed by your people's daily experiences.

Yes, we know that South Africa is a democratic society, but if the same
democratic institutions are not sensitive to the needs of our people, what
guarantee do we have that such institutions, young as they are, may mature
and generate our traditional institutions harmoniously without creating
competition or threatening the survival of the other?

We are calling on you, Mr President, to listen and attend to the concerns
raised by traditional leaders. These are institutions that will indeed make
Nepad work or fail. There is no doubt that we all want Nepad to work
because we embrace its broader principles.

The issues relating to Zimbabwe, the DRC, Burundi, Sierra Leone and Nigeria
keep on creeping up each time Nepad and continental stability are
discussed. We believe that Nepad's success largely depends on whether other
African leaders are prepared to work or not.

We also wish to ask: Whilst the President has managed to win the hearts and
minds of the G8 leaders, will we be able to see the results sooner than
expected or was this matter another ploy to deal with Africa so that the G8
countries continue with their normal agenda of strengthening their own grip
on Africa?

Our message to the President is: Do not be hoodwinked by events that are
far away from home. Take care of people who expect much from our office. We
surely know what challenges South Africa is faced with since
democratisation.

Tautona, ke eletsa gore o seke wa nkutlwa ka tsa ga Morakile, mmualebe wa

[Mr President, I would like you to understand me properly; we mean what we
say. A job becomes easier when many people give their assistance. We in the
UCDP aim to work with the Government to achieve the aims and objectives of
working for the people and improving their lives.

Unity is power. Unemployment breeds criminality, and this then unsettles
the country. All of these problems can be managed if we can unite. The UCDP
accepts and supports this budget.]

Dr E A SCHOEMAN: Madam Speaker, hon President, it is a privilege to wish
you a happy birthday. May you receive bountiful blessings in your
endeavours to lead South Africa and the African continent.

On receiving a lifetime Achievement award from the internationally renowned
Laureus Academy of Sport a couple of weeks ago, that great South African
sportsman Gary Player said: "I love and adore my country South Africa." The
numerous social projects in which he is involved - amongst others, a school
of over 500 learners, which he built and sustains - were mentioned and he
responded: "I believe in giving of myself, because the more you give, the
greater the reward."

These words and deeds epitomise the spirit of sharing, without expecting
reward, but knowing the Biblical truth of "casting your bread upon the
water and it will return in multitude." The other truism, of course, is
that real giving and sharing should be voluntary; compulsion leads to
resentment and a feeling of being threatened.

History abounds with examples where the oppressed of yesterday become the
oppressors of today. In our own history, the oppression and humiliation
suffered by the Afrikaner through British imperialism gave rise to an
exclusive nationalism that went horribly wrong.

With the advent of our new democracy in 1994, the fear of reprisal was a
natural reflex reaction. The miracle of our new democracy was not the
miracle of an event, but rather because of a process. The shared passion
for our country provided a basis for learning to trust one another. The
philosophy of inclusivity, as contained in the Freedom Charter of the ANC
of 1955, facilitated the process. The ANC does not see itself as an
exclusive organisation, nor does it exclude anyone from becoming part of
the South African nation. Indeed, South Africa belongs to all its people,
black and white. [Applause.]

Those who are still obsessed with misguided fears, suspicion, cynicism and
scepticism should cross the Rubicon of the mind and join hands to become
part of this dynamic new nation. The Afrikaner, I believe, is ready to
embark on this symbolic trek, the epic journey of the African Renaissance.
Rectifying the injustices and discriminatory practices of the past must
become everyone's challenge. The world-renowned financier, Dr Anton Rupert,
stated many years ago: "Nobody can sleep soundly if his neighbour is
hungry." Together we must push back the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

There are fears amongst many whites regarding developments north of our
borders. Continual reassurances from you, Mr President, seem to go
unheeded. It is quite ironic that the very critics of your international
involvement are the most vociferous in urging your involvement in Zimbabwe.
[Interjections.] Your principled approach regarding the Zimbabwe issue not
only meets our approval, but is also recognised by senior statesmen
throughout the world as being the correct one.

This year is the 90th anniversary of the infamous 1913 Land Acts which
deprived the majority of South African citizens of their right to land. It
is right that we continue to focus on this contentious issue. Your
continued interest in agriculture and the land issue is greatly
appreciated. Although the multiplier effect of agriculture contributes in
the vicinity of 30% to our economy, the net contribution of primary
agriculture is less that 5%, and is diminishing. This is in line with other
industrialised or semi-industrialised countries. Land is not necessarily
the key to wealth and prosperity. Fact is that primary agriculture's debt
exceeds R28 billion, indicating that many farmers are in an invidious
financial position.

This in no way detracts from the importance of agriculture for national and
household food security. Farming is a noble and rewarding profession. Our
young black youth, in particular, must not be lured by bright city lights,
and we encourage them to study agriculture and become part of this vital
industry.

Land is an emotional issue. The renowned Afrikaans poet and author Dirk or
D J Opperman, expressed his attachment to land as follows:


  Ek het 'n stukkie grond gekoop
  met melkhout op; dit afgekamp
  en teen die hek 'n naam geverf
  sodat verbygangers besef:
  Dis Dirk se erf.


  Bakkapel glip uit my melkhoutbos,
  verby die kruin, verby die rots,
  en teken op sandkolle waar hy kom
  oral in ouderwetse skrif:


  "Alles ... alles my eiendom."

Just as we are from the soil, we will return to the soil. We never lose
this bond, and we all yearn for our own piece of earth.

Our territorial imperative and need for security have led to most historic
conflicts. All parties in this House seem to be in agreement that the
present inequitable land ownership pattern in South Africa is unacceptable
and must be rectified. It has been stated repeatedly that the Constitution
will guide the land reform process in South Africa. This is, of course, the
correct and the only approach. It is, however, a source of concern that
after nearly 10 years, our land reform targets do not seem to be on track.
Although the land restitution process has been accelerating, with nearly
half of the 79 649 claims having been settled, the land redistribution leg
of land reform seems to be experiencing difficulties.

By saying this, I do not wish to detract from the excellent work which has
been done by our Minister, her departments and institutions such as the
Land Bank. It is estimated that a capital budget of R1,7 billion per annum
is required for the purchase of land, if the target to deliver 30% of
commercial agricultural land by 2015 is to be met. We are aware that
negotiations with Treasury are presently under way to access increased
funds for land redistribution for the agricultural development programme.
We trust that you will support this endeavour.

Hon President, there are many facets of land reform which are resulting in
frustration. Expectations have been created amongst people who are
landless. Although a firm hand to prevent land invasion is needed,
Government is all too aware of the potential time bomb situation.

The private sector also has a vital role to play. The commercial farming
sector, through AgriSA, has become an active role-player. Individual
farmers and agriculturalists have come to offer their knowledge, expertise
and land. Mr President, in Zimbabwe, the active involvement by the
commercial farming sector in land reform only occurred when it was too
late. A summit of all role-players to ensure successful land reform has
become an imperative. The result should be an inclusive, co-ordinated and
well-structured process of land redistribution, which can be monitored on a
continuous basis.

Onteenseglik bestaan groot welwillendheid by baie boere wat die
noodsaaklikheid van grondhervorming besef. Hierdie progressiewe individue
verdien ons lof en aanmoediging. Onlangs het die Du Toit Boerderygroep van
Ceres 500 van hulle werkers bemagtig deur hulle volle aandeelhouding in 'n
nuwe verkoelingsaanleg te laat bekom. Daarbenewens, word die benutting
daarvan vir ten minste vyf jaar gewaarborg wat 'n dividendinkomste reeds
van die eerste jaar afverseker.

Instansies soos Distell, Capespan, die suikerbedryf, Graan  SA, Agri SA,
die Nasionale Wolkwekersvereniging, die Rooivleisprodusenteorganisasie, en
baie ander, is reeds betrokke by bemagtingingsprogramme. Individuele
suksesverhale soos die Nelson's Creek projek in die Paarl, die Land for
Peace projek van Roger Roman by Hartebeespoort, die suksesvolle vestiging
van voorheen benadeelde boere op sitrusplase in Sondagsriviervallei, en
baie meer, getuig van die verbondenheid tot grondhervorming en bemagtiging.
Onlangs het ons ook die lofwaardige voorbeeld van die bejaarde mnr John van
der Byl van Naboomspruit ervaar, wat 'n werker, mnr William Ramatsi, wat
reeds 50 jaar by hom werk, 80 hektaar van sy grond, en 22 beeste gegee het.
Verdere soortgelyke inisiatiewe moet aangemoedig word.

Die mentorskapprogram, waarvolgens progressiewe kommersiële boere opkomende
boere onder hulle vleuel neem, is ook besig om in momentum toe te neem.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There is indisputably great goodwill among many farmers who realise the
necessity of land reform. These progressive individuals deserve our praise
and encouragement. Recently the Du Toit Farming Group of Ceres empowered
500 of their employees by granting them full shareholding in a new cooling
plant. Apart from that its utilisation is being guaranteed for at least
five years, which ensures an income in dividends from as early as the very
first year.

Institutions such as Distell, Capespan, GrainSA, AgriSA, the National Wool
Growers' Association, the Red Meat Producers' Organisation, and many
others, are already involved in empowerment programmes. Individual success
stories such as the Nelson's Creek project in Paarl, the Land for Peace
project of Roger Roman at Hartebeespoort, the successful establishment of
previously disadvantaged farmers on citrus farms in the Sundays River
Valley, and many more, testify to the commitment to land reform and
empowerment. Recently we also saw the laudable example of the elderly Mr
John van der Byl of Naboomspruit, who gave a worker, Mr William Ramatsi,
who has already been working for him for 50 years, 80 hectares of land and
22 head of cattle. Further similar initiatives should be encouraged.

The mentorship programme, whereby progressive commercial farmers take
emerging farmers under their wing, is also increasing in momentum.]

Political parties generally have two ways of eliciting support, namely
either by generating hope, or by instilling fear amongst the voters. The
DA, sadly, uses the latter approach. "Swartgevaar" has been replaced by the
"Zimbabwe gevaar". [Applause.] In essence, their message is the same,
namely that this Government is going to condone land invasions and
seizures, abuse powers of expropriation, and that in the agricultural
sector minimum wage and land taxes are deliberate means of forcing
commercial farmers to vacate land.

The DA never highlights the success stories to which I have alluded. They
use land as a political tool to elicit support. They think nothing of
putting a match to the powder keg, because unlike us true Africans, many of
them carry two passports, and will run while we face the challenges of
operating a just society. [Applause.] They suffer from the pre-1994
syndrome, conveniently forgetting about the then depressed economy, high
inflation rates, empty harbours and deserted airports. Maybe we should pity
them, because their small world was confined to the perimeters of Houghton,
Waterkloof, Constantia and the JSE. [Applause.]

It would seem that the repeated assurances by yourself, Mr President, the
Minister and Government, concerning the indispensable role of commercial
agriculture, go unheard. More likely, it is a case of not wanting to
listen.

It is disappointing that the application of a minimum wage in agriculture,
which is an attempt to create a contented farming community, has resulted
in such negative reaction. Neither the principle of a minimum wage, nor the
level at which it has been set can be disputed. I do not believe that any
employer with compassion can expect a worker and his or her family to
survive on less. The hon Minister of Labour has indicated that he is open
to suggestions, especially concerning remuneration in kind.

Hon President, we are privileged to live in this wonderful country at this
point in our history. Like the proverbial rocket, ready to be launched into
space, the countdown has begun. In fact, we are already in the lift-off
phase. Black and white are taking hands to ensure the success of our
mission. Indeed, success is assured, because we have a commander-in-chief
with the insight and vision of Thabo Mbeki. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA:  Madam Speaker, to our hon President, who is a good, solid
60-odd years today, many happy returns.

Ka Sepedi re re o monna-tia lehono; o monna wa banna. [You have come of
age; you are a real man.]

South Africa, with all its beauty and its world-acclaimed fame of having
overcome its racial curse, has one major river to cross: fear. Fear of one
kind or another has woven itself like a golden thread into the fabric
called South Africa. It was the fear of ``baasskap'' [domination], which
took the form of the dompas and cringing subservience.

The Afrikaner was the main prototype of this era. One would have thought
that their appropriate name would have been Zuid-Afrikaner, but they took
the ambitious name of Afrikaner. Their spirit was Pan-Africanist, for when
they got on their ox wagons and traversed the Cape and the Free State -
they went to Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Lydenburg, Pietermaritzburg - they
just could n't stop. Some went to Zimbabwe, Zambia and Kenya.

On a recent visit by our parliamentary land and agricultural affairs
committee to Zimbabwe, we visited an interesting community in the Zimbabwe
Midlands. We found them gathered on a farm under the trees - Afrikaners,
the English, Zimbabweans, the war veterans, the lot. They were bound
together by their common love of the land. They formed a new community. The
Afrikaners in the group said to us: "We belong here. We are living together
here. Those who want to go away should do so. We belong here."
We later visited their fields - black and white farmers - and they had a
bumper harvest. One black lady said: "I'm going to be a millionaire this
year." My heart leapt. Here was the Pan-African dream unfolding itself. No
more fear. After fear, prosperity. Here was Pan-Africanism, African
Renaissance and Nepad dramatically played out in a single farming
community.

Why then should the Afrikaners of South Africa make themselves foreigners
in South Africa and in Africa? Why do they distrust their compatriots to
the point of wanting to seclude themselves in Orania and want to form a
liberation army - Die Boeremag - not to liberate themselves, but to enslave
themselves? Why fight against people who have stopped fighting, who have
melted their swords into ploughshares?

Now, coming to the Africans we have a different scenario. They were
oppressed together, killed together at Sharpeville, broke stones together
at Robben Island and went into exile together. Now that the war is over,
why is there a cleavage? Some even prefer joining hands with Afrikaners
rather than with the Africans. What is the problem? Where lies the fear?

One ambassador from an African state once said to me: Can you explain this
puzzling phenomenon? Why is it easier to form an alliance with the
Afrikaners than with the Africanists of old? I said I did not know but that
I thought that part of the answer may be put simply as, "the Western Cape
problem." He was not convinced. He thought that there must be something
very deep, something that was a national secret or a missing link.

Put in other words or in clearer terms, can we talk of Pan-Africanism that
unites all Africans except some who should not be accorded the same status
and the same rights? Can we refer to an African Renaissance or Nepad when
some Africans are basically ignored or wished out of existence? These are
some of the questions that keep coming up and need to be clarified.

On a broad policy aspect, the question of land is a hardy annual. Whilst
appreciating the progress of land distribution in recent months, we are all
aware that there is a limit to what can be distributed. If one has a few
slices from a loaf of bread and is distributing that, well, the question
that keeps coming up is, what about the whole loaf? Not to address the
question of the whole loaf is merely postponing the inevitable.

We are of the view that we need to urgently address the legal aspects of
land distribution regarding compensation and canvassing the whole
population about the amendment of section 25 of the Constitution. Force is
unnecessary and undesirable, but surely all people who are enjoying an
unfair advantage over others should be gracious enough to offer some
compromise. We need peace in our fledgling democracy and cannot have peace
without considerable sacrifice. It is reasonable and wise to negotiate for
peace and stability. It is unwise and short-sighted to ignore the time bomb
and merely hope and pray that it will go away.

Aids sufferers and potential sufferers and people without jobs are waiting
desperately in anticipation of some sort of relief. The flower of the youth
of the nation is being decimated. We appreciate the increase in the budget
for Aids work, but we need to spare no money and resources. We should
respond as if it were a situation of war. War is war.

On Zimbabwe, we are anxious to see positive change in the areas of
negotiations, a government of national unity and economic recovery. We
agree with our President that no amount of force can help Zimbabwe. Those
who advocate force should look at the Iraqi debacle. One can win a battle
but lose a war. The cost of picking up the pieces and restructuring or
reviving a country that has been destroyed is immense, and all that money
will be money down the drain. To negotiate is tedious and frustrating, but
that remains the only way of bringing about a win-win situation. The
alternative is a win-lose or a lose-lose scenario. We support negotiations,
negotiations, negotiations. The PAC supports this Vote. [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President, hon
Ministers and hon members, on behalf of the MF and the leader of the MF,
the Tiger Mr Rajbansi, I would like to kindly take this opportunity and
wish our hon President Thabo Mbeki a very happy birthday. May Almighty God
spare you for many more years to come so that you can, hon President, watch
our South Africa grow from strength to strength. Have a joyous day and, of
course, a joyous evening.

The MF notes the key arms of support that this department holds towards the
President, the Deputy President and Ministers in the President's Office.
The department's management of its faculties is applauded, noting the vast
spectrum of duties it covers. It is hoped that the budget allocated is
sufficient to secure the department's efficiency in co-ordinating and
monitoring Government policies.

Appreciation is expressed for the attention that has been given by this
department to gender equality, children's rights and rights of the
disabled. Attention and concern do notably extend from these to a broader
spectrum of concern, but with the transformation of our society and the
issues of poverty, attention to the three aspects mentioned is necessary.
The MF is pleased with the department's efforts in this respect and
compliments the Government on its efforts to improve the quality of life
and delivery and to defeat social challenges such as the Aids pandemic,
poverty and crime.

Our President's presence in society has been inspirational and promising to
our people that we are in good hands. Our Government is doing its best to
correct the imbalances of the past and it is encouraging that we shall be
successful under the leadership of our hon President Thabo Mbeki. Our hon
President and his competent Ministers have built strong ties abroad and we
are treated with respect, thanks to our proficient President. Your
honourable leadership is better today than yesterday, and tomorrow will be
even better. You are our hope, our courage and our strength to overcome our
difficulties and achieve a better life for all in South Africa. Yes, hon
President, how right you were when you said in your presidential address,
and I quote: "South Africa belongs to all who live in it."

Hon President, the MF believes that one who lives in South Africa not only
lives in it, but also lives for it, and that anyone who lives in South
Africa and not for South Africa, does not live in South Africa. Thank you,
hon President, for bringing South Africa back to us. Ibuyile iAfrika
[Africa is back]. [Interjections.]

The MF has confidence in the department's competence and supports the
Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

[Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate our President on his birthday.
Long may he live! I will highlight what Budget Vote 1 for the Presidency is
doing, especially the focus on the disabled.]

Most societies identify people with disabilities as being different from
their non-disabled peers. This has resulted in severe isolation for people
with disabilities and their families. Let me share with you what happened
in my constituency. One day it was raining heavily, with thunder and
lightning. The lightning struck one of the huts. Out came this figure
running for dear life. When people saw it, they started chasing it and
running after it shouting, ``Nḓadzi'' [lightning]. This figure stopped
abruptly and raised its hands up and shouted at the top of its voice: ``A
si nḓadzi ndi muthu. Ndi ṅwana wa vho-mukene.'' ``Ni a zwifha a ni dzuli
hone. Vhana vha hafho muḓini ri a vha ḓivha vhoṱhe.'' Vhana vha henefho
muḓini vhe vha vha vhe vhukati ha iḽo gogo vha tenda zwauri ndi murathu
wavho. (Translation of Venḓa paragraph follows.)

[``I am a human being, not a beam of lightning. I am somebody's child''.
``You are a liar; you don't stay here. We know all the children from this
family''. Children from that very same family, who were present, confirmed
that he is indeed their brother.]

For more than 10 years, people from that neighbourhood did not know that
there was a disabled child who lived in that house. With the help of our
Government, this child is attending school like other children today.
[Applause.] This shows that people with disabilities are excluded from the
mainstream of society and experience difficulties in accessing fundamental
rights. There is a strong relationship between disability and poverty.
Poverty makes people more vulnerable to disability. And disability
reinforces and deepens poverty.

Muhulisei vho Nefolovhodwe, u yela Gaba, Tshifuḓi na Tshaulu hu na

[Hon Nefolovhodwe will agree with me that, towards Gaba, Tshifudi and
Tshaulu, there are several disabled people. I was asked by that community
to come and find out what the President and the ANC-led Government have in
place for them. The main message was that President Mbeki said we should
unite, arise, act and work.]

In that area, many disabled children were left not in their homes when
their parents went to work. We discussed with the community and showed them
how the President and our Government can assist them. A few women
volunteered to look after these disabled children. A local businessman
offered them two unused rondavels in order to start a daycare centre for
those disabled children. They named the centre ``Ri Songo Neta'' which
means ``We are not going to give up''. Comrade Ṱovhowani Tshivhase, our MP,
donated plastic chairs for the centre. Ri a livhuwa muhulisi Vho Tshivhase.
[Thank you, hon Tshivhase.] [Applause.]

The volunteers told me that they wanted to write a letter to the President
in Tshivenda so that they could express themselves clearly. I encouraged
them to write their letter, and promised them that their letter would be
answered. Indeed the letter was answered. [Applause.]

Ri a livhuwa Muphuresidede washu na tshipano tshavho tshi sa dzhieli zwithu

President and his team for not taking things for granted. They are giving
life to the downtrodden people.]
Mrs Merafe from the Department of Social Development from Pretoria came,
and we accompanied her to Ri Songo Neta Day Care Centre for the disabled
which accommodated plus-minus 38 disabled children by then.

Venḓa paragraph follows.)

[We would like to thank the hon Minister Skweyiya. Don't give up. You still
have a lot do. In the past months, the President received a letter from a
white Afrikaner who was praising him for the big task he is doing for the
people. Some of what he wrote in this letter was the following, and I
quote:]


  Africa is preparing to take its rightful place at the head of a new cycle
  in the history of humanity because it is a necessary stage in the
  unfolding of an anniversary spirit.

This Afrikaner acknowledges what our President is doing to change Africa,
and South Africa in particular, to improve the lives of all citizens, both
black and white. The apartheid regime failed to improve the quality of life
of people with disabilities, poverty-stricken communities and those who are
illiterate.

Previously people with disabilities were denied opportunities to
participate fully in society because of a lack of services and programmes
which included them to meet their needs. This budget is trying very hard to
change the status quo and the mess that apartheid caused. The Office on the
Status of Disabled Persons in the Presidency has been established in order
to facilitate, co-ordinate, monitor and evaluate all Government programmes
and projects that seek to mainstream disability issues.

Offices have also been established in the office of the premier throughout
the country. The office will be focusing on raising awareness and the
establishment of disability units within local government. The Presidency
also focuses on integrating and monitoring policies across Government.

During apartheid, disability was couched within a medical welfare
framework, identifying people with disabilities as ill, whereas under our
ANC-led Government, disability is repositioned as a human rights issue. The
Office on the Status of Disabled Persons maintains and works closely with
NGOs to work towards the transformation of society through a policy of self-
representation.

In 1995, the ANC included Maria Ranto as a member of Parliament. Then, in
1999, six leaders of persons with disabilities were included in the
proportional representation model and took up their seats in Parliament.
Our policies promote equity and prevention of unfair discrimination on the
grounds of disability. The Employment Equity Act encourages the Public
Service to employ a minimum of 2% of disabled persons. The South African
Schools Act promotes the inclusion of learners with special educational
needs.

We encourage the IEC to make sure that voting booths and voting stations
are accessible to people with disabilities. Voting papers should be
available to the blind via Braille. Election campaigns on TV should be
accessible to people who are deaf so that they know exactly what is
expected from them.

Mutshena wa Mu-Afurikanere o isa phanḓa kha luṅwalo lwawe lwe a ṅwalela
Muphuresidende ari: [This white Afrikaner continued. He said, and I quote:]
``Africa, the hopeless continent, is destined to become the hope of
humanity. The darkest continent is destined to become the most enlightened.
The last will be the first. Little orphan Africa is destined to become the
mother of a more compassionate human era.''

Yes, it is true that the tide has turned. We sang ``Phambili Makwedini''
[Forward, boys!] when this land was darker than it is now. Yes, the tide
has turned. Africa, the time has come.

Muphuresidende, ri khou tendelana na heyi Budget Vote. Ri ḓo vha tika nga

zwanḓa.] [Mr President, we support this Budget Vote. We will support you
with all our might. We will unite, rise and work. I thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HEALTH: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon President, hon
Deputy President, and hon members, in world history there is a tendency for
leaders and statesmen to become strongly associated with a specific speech
of major significance which they have delivered. So it is in our country
that a leader like general J B M Hertzog is thought of in terms of his
``South Africa first'' speech in 1912. Martin Luther King Jr is famous for
his ``I have a dream'' oration in 1964. President Mandela is imprinted in
people's mind with his ``I am prepared to die'' statement from the dock at
the Rivonia trial on 20 April 1964, and F W de Klerk for his ``Negotiation
in the new South Africa'' speech on 2 February 1990. You, Mr President, are
inextricably linked to your ``I am an African'' in this Parliament on 8 May
1996. That speech is as relevant today as it was seven years ago, and I
wish to give my own perspective on that speech as to what its implications
are for the political discourse in the year 2003.

Madam Speaker, for me as an African, who is also a South African, that
speech says my destiny and future is in Africa and Africa alone. It says
there is space for me and my distinct cultural life - for my mother tongue,
Afrikaans, for my religion, for my values and my lifestyle - provided I
grant the same space to every single other South African. It says that
whilst being mindful of and sensitive to the pain and suffering and
conflict of the past, and even of the present, I can play my full role in
every way to help build a South Africa that is a caring and worthwhile
place, and a better place for all its people.

The speech also says to me I must not only be proudly South African, but I
must want this country to succeed and to play its rightful role on our
continent. And so today, Madam Speaker, I would like to appeal to my fellow
South Africans, fellow Africans of South Africa, to take hands in this
effort, and to discard the self-imposed shackles of this joyless negativity
and pessimism, and a thinly veiled racism and prejudice and suspicion, that
we so often see. And I also warn them against the destructive tendency to
bad-mouth our country and our continent, and the real danger inherent in
the highly sophisticated but still obvious use of discredited ``swart
gevaar'' tactics of old, which one particular party tries to resort to in
different ways. That road is leading nowhere, and it does not belong in the
politics of the new South Africa. And, Madam Speaker, it is as these
Africans, to which the hon President Mbeki refers, that the New NP and the
ANC have entered a relationship which is based on a number of shared
convictions, and which continues to grow.

An important milestone on this road of co-operation was reached on 27 April
this year when President Mbeki and Marthinus van Schalkwyk signed a joint
declaration in Pretoria. I merely wish to quote one or two sentences of
that declaration, namely:


  "We are inspired by the growing spirit of unity among all our people, as
  they work together to build a new South Africa that belongs to all who
  live in it.


  At the same time, we recognise the fact that much remains to be done
  further to nurture this emerging spirit, which is informed by a new
  patriotism that acknowledges the diverse attributes and contributions of
  the people who constitute our nation.

Madam Speaker, my submission today is that this is the road of the new
South Africa, and I urge my fellow South Africans to join us on that road.
Precisely because it is not an easy road, we can expect obstacles and even
setbacks as we move along it, also as a party. But we will continue along
it, because we as a party are utterly convinced that it is the right road
for South Africa. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, hon Mr President, first of all congratulations
on your birthday. May God give you the strength and the wisdom to rule this
country with devotion, and to fulfil your duties with distinction.

I must also congratulate you, Mr President, on your first encounter with
traditional Afrikaner "volkspele", where you joined the "volkspelers"
Monday in the Jan van Riebeeck Stadium to the beat of Ek soek na my Diena.
This gesture of yours is really appreciated. Even in our culture, to dance
with people is to identify with them. So we want to say thanks very much,
neef Thabo. [Applause.]

I hereby also extend an offer to you to help you to extend your repertoire,
and at the same time to do wonders for your Presidency. I want to teach you
a "volkspele" [folk dances] song which you in turn can dedicate to
President Robert Mugabe. The name of that song is Vat jou goed en trek,
Ferreira. [Laughter.]

Mr President, maybe the best reflection of your Presidency was the previous
Thursday when it was your turn to answer questions in this House - on the
whole, a professional, hands-on and balanced performance. Balanced and
realistic, with sustainable views and answers on the economy, on relations
in South Africa - a fresh breeze on the need for Africa to take control of
its own destiny.

And then, the total opposite picture when it comes to Zimbabwe - a futile
attempt to use the DRC or other countries as a decoy to avoid saying the
right thing on Zimbabwe. Mr President, you and Minister Essop Pahad today
again asked over and over: Why ask me about Zimbabwe? Why don't you ask me
about the DRC where many more people died?

The truth of the matter is, Mr President, that in a democracy a member of
the executive, even the president, does not have the luxury to determine
the agenda of matters for which he is to be held accountable. Your job here
in Parliament is to answer questions, not to dictate them.

You know better than me that perceptions are the name of the game. Let me
in this regard quote Tim du Plessis, the editor of Rapport. And by the way
Rapport is the largest Afrikaans newspaper in the world. He wrote:


  Vandag nog is Mbeki vreesloos wanneer hy sy linkse, sosialistiese kritici
  in Cosatu en die SAKP bydam as hulle hom uitdaag oor sy regering se
  ekonomiese beleid. Hoekom dan is 'n man wat soveel politieke moed het,
  onwillig om reguit te praat oor die verwoestingswerk in Zimbabwe?

Meneer, die Nasionale Aksie wil dringend van u weet of u Mugabe ook
geadviseer het om nie massa-optrede met brute staatsgeweld te onderdruk
nie, soos wat u meneer Tsvangirai geadviseer het om hom nie tot massa-aksie
te wend nie. En ons vra of onderhandelinge kan voortgaan - dié waarna u
verwys het - terwyl mnr Tsvangirai in boeie is.

Terug na Suid-Afrika. Ons het ten minste twee gevalle onlangs gehad, Meneer
die President, waar u Regering positief gereageer het op druk vanuit die
samelewing teen beoogde beleidstandpunte. Die een was die beoogde
godsdiensbeleid in skole. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Sir, the National Action urgently wants to know from you if you also
advised Mugabe not to suppress mass action with brutal state violence, as
you advised Mr Tsvangirai not to use mass action. And we want to ask if
negotiations can continue - those to which you referred - while Mr
Tsvangirai is in chains?

Back to South Africa. We have had at least two incidents recently in which
your Government, Mr President, reacted positively to pressure from society
against envisaged policy stands. One was the envisaged religious policy in
schools.]

It was met with a public outcry. The NA appreciates your encounter with
religious leaders, and the latest trends, the greater role of SGBs and the
re-invitation for public inputs.

Die ander geval - die Nasionale Aksie het met dank kennis geneem van u
verklaring gedurende 'n imbizo-besoek aan Noordwes, dat die kommandostelsel
nie uitgefaseer gaan word nie maar "herskik" gaan word, eweneens in
antwoord op 'n groot vlaag van kritiek en verontwaardiging wat u
aankondiging op 14 Februarie uitgelok het. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The other incident - it was with gratitude that the National Action took
note of your statement during an imbizo visit to the North West that the
commando system will not be phased out, but will be transformed, albeit in
response to a big flurry of criticism and outrage unleashed by your
announcement on 14 February.]

Mr President, the National Action in this regard is not a spiteful
opposition. A spiteful opposition is one that puts pressure on government
to change a particular policy, and the moment government yields to their
request they become triumphant: we forced them to back out or back down,
whatever it may be. No, Mr President, we in the National Action say it is a
good sign, it is a symptom of sound democracy to listen and to rethink
policies.

But, hon President, we want to warn against a habit amongst high-ranked ANC
officials and Ministers to make radical statements to test the water, to
send these statements out as flyers, to see perhaps how far you can go. In
the meantime a lot of damage is done, sometimes even in the field of
investor confidence. Too often these statements are made by Cabinet
Ministers and are never repudiated by you, not even the statement that
President Bush may attack South Africa for its minerals.

Hon President, there is widespread appreciation for your willingness to
negotiate with Solidarity on their proposals for an equity accord on
affirmative action. The NA hopes that this meeting will soon materialise to
perhaps put an end to the second largest reason why a lot of people feel
marginalised and leave the country.

Mr President, the NA says no South African may be marginalised. No
community may be at risk with regard to what is precious to them. No
minority, hon Annelizé van Wyk, must be forced to act, believe and become
like the majority in order to be recognised.

Mr President, we still have a lot of problems. The National Action will
play its part positively to address and to solve these problems. Let your
realistic economic policies increasingly become practice in your dealing
with the rich diversity of South Africa, and maybe next time you and I can
dance together to the song Afrikaners is plesierig. Ek dank u. [I thank
you.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: The hon Aucamp, are you offering also to learn to toyi-toyi?
[Laughter.]

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, comrades and friends, this Budget Vote could
not have come at a more relevant time as we celebrate the heroic
contribution of the youth in the struggle for liberation. During National
Youth Day two days ago we commemorated the 27th anniversary of the Soweto
uprisings, under the theme ``Youth action to seize opportunities of
democracy''. This clarion call is an acknowledgement of the many
opportunities and challenges presented by the democratic dispensation to
the youth of this country. This month therefore represents for us a
milestone by the youth of South Africa to reclaim their birthright, the
birthright of their people. It represents a sacrosanct, noble,
revolutionary act to renounce colonialism and reassert our humanity. It is
therefore a celebration of the colossal voluntary sacrifice of our people
as they struggle to free themselves from the bondages of oppression and get
on the pathway to emancipation.

We also welcome the move of the AU to declare June 16 the day of the
African child. This inspires us as young people to volunteer to contribute
immensely to the reconstruction and development of our country and the
continent. This, Comrade President, therefore reminds us that the first
call made by the President of a free Tanganyika, Comrade Rashidi Kawawa,
was directed at the youth to assume responsibility and engage rural
communities in respect of illiteracy, agriculture, health, etc. He urged
the youth to serve the deprived people of Tanganyika as that was the only
way to defend their revolution.

This was, amongst other things, what led the late Julius Nyerere, the
president of Tanganyika, later renamed Tanzania, to introduce a concept of
Ujama, which meant the reconstruction and revival of the African spirit for
a better life for all. The declaration of June 16 as the day of the African
child, therefore, is a call for action, and finds more expression in the
words of one great African leader Comrade Moses Khotani to the youth of
this country when he said: "At this hour of destiny, your country and your
people need you. The future of South Africa is in your hands and it will be
what you make of it." As we salute the 1976 youth generation, and
generations that came before and after it, we are humbled by their
understanding that the price of freedom and justice was life itself.

We are further inspired to understand that the struggle owes us nothing. We
owe everything to the struggle. We owe our very existence to the struggle.
[Applause.] Comrade President, ours is therefore to take action and seize
the opportunities of democracy. When I was doing my matric some 12 years
ago my mom, who was unemployed, had to pay an amount of R167 for what was
called a matric examination fee. Many of my peers were not as fortunate and
therefore could not complete their matric. Today no learner is subjected to

[Ms M C LOBE: Chairperson, we salute the Government's initiative of
providing grants to children and of raising the age limit to 14 years,
during which time they should receive grants. We are aware that all these
cannot be realised overnight. A Mosotho national maintains that the wild
grape will never get ripe in accordance with the monkey's wish. This raised
age limit will help in the fight against poverty, and in the process of
ensuring that South African children are being meaningfully brought up.
Your honour, we really appreciate this initiative. Half a loaf is better
than no bread.
These children's grants and, of course, those of the elderly, and the
disabled show that the Government cares. And it is at the top of the agenda
in the people's development programme. Many people will therefore be able
to understand what we mean by moral regeneration. Let me take this
opportunity and thank the Deputy President and the whole Ministry for a job
well done, which you do for the benefit of regenerating humanity. It is
true that being young means being filled with pride and this can be
deceptive. But this does not mean that we as the youth must do things as we
wish and forget our human nature.

In all this we understand very well that the main idea is that a person is
what he or she is because of other people. And my child is your child. Last
year the Deputy President organised a meeting and invited all South
Africans to the inauguration of the council of humanity regeneration. One
of the issues which touched our emotions is the issue of substance abuse
amongst the youth. Meetings of this nature therefore spread to different
provinces and districts. This shows that changes are beginning and they are
actually happening. To be more precise, humanity regeneration is the theme
as well as the beginning of rebuilding and regenerating our country.

It is necessary, therefore, that we must remember what makes us South
Africans different from other nations. What compelled you to give your
neighbour some maize-meal when he or she didn't have any? The source of the
whole of this issue is that ``a person becomes what he or she is because of
other people.'']

The youth are a major human resource that has to be developed and utilised
for the future prospects of our country. Recent studies indicate that the
youth labour absorption by Government is twice that of the private sector,
and it's something that, as this Government, we need to acknowledge.
Secondly, this absorption is more sustainable than that of the private
sector. We welcome this, and further congratulate our Government on
creating an enabling environment for youth empowerment and its
sustainability. We are proud that our country has provided a space for
youth development in its democratic processes through legislative and other
means.

Today South Africa has a National Youth Policy Framework, and we are in the
process of launching the National Youth Service Programme. The National
Youth Commission, the South African Youth Council and the Umsobomvu Fund
have achieved great strides in assisting Government to prepare the youth to
contribute meaningfully to the development of our country. The National
Youth Commission, the Umsobomvu Fund in this regard, has developed a
partnership with the Land Bank, in which various programmes are taking
place in the Free State, North West, the Western Cape and Northern Cape,
where young people are given an opportunity to own farms, but above all,
are empowered to manage and sustain these agricultural ventures.

This has gone a long way towards the development of young farmers, and also
towards ensuring that the youth is further encouraged to participate in the
agricultural sector. During 2002 more than 20 000 youth volunteers joined
the Letsema campaign launched by the President. This was indeed informed by
the understanding that those who want to go to heaven must accept that they
must die first. Those who want to harvest crops must first plough the
fields. Those who wish for or want rain must accept that it will be
preceded by thunder and lightning. And those who seek change will have to
accept that it will be preceded by long and bitter struggles.

It is within this framework, Comrade President, that we, as the working
youth, accept the challenge caused by the youth formations in partnership
with the private sector, for us to contribute to the projected Youth
Solidarity Fund. [Applause.]

As we take action to seize opportunities of democracy, we also seek to
highlight for all to acknowledge the immense innovation and creativity of
South African youth in the field of sport, business, arts, culture,
education, and even politics. My appeal is that every young South African
should embrace the spirit in the words of Martin Luther King Jr:
  If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep the streets
  even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven played music, or Shakespeare
  wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of
  heaven and earth will pause to say `here lived a great street sweeper who
  did his job well.

As we march forward towards the second decade of our freedom, we are
convinced that our challenges are many and quite complex. We are, however,
inspired by the positive leadership of our President, which reminds me
every day of a Japanese proverb, which, for the sake of members of this
House, I won't say in Japanese: ``Vision without action is a dead dream,
action without vision is a nightmare.'' We are grateful to be guided by a
person with vision, and who always strives to realise vision through
action. And we thank you, Comrade President, for that.

As young people, we see the fruits of this on a daily basis, and come 2004,
we are convinced that the ANC will win the elections convincingly. And you,
Comrade President, will be confirmed, once again, as that visionary, as
that practitioner that will have to take this country forward.

In conclusion, I want to share a story of a 14-year-old girl. This 14-year-
old girl, in 1987, was forced to cram what was then called - I know it is
still called that even now - uluskietejag. Those of you who are very good
at poetry will understand what I am talking about. And this young woman was
given 24 hours to cram uluskietejag.  Now, this woman is 30 years old today
and she has only just learned that uluskietejag is about a mosquito. And
the only thing she can remember about uluskietejag today - there are two
things - is ``jou vabond'' [you rascal], the second one is ``pardoef, dis
mis'' [whack, I missed]. [Laughter.]. Now I am using this particular
example to illustrate the kind of education background some of us come
from. Even today I do not understand what ``pardoef'' means, but I hope
Minister Manuel will help me to understand what ``pardoef'' means; ``dis
mis'' I understand.

Now, Comrade President, with that ... ke batla hore mahlohonolo a hao a
letsatsi la tswalo, o hole o lekane le tlou. O re holele, empa o se ke wa
kgokgoba. Ke a leboha. [Mahofi.] [... I wish you all the best on your
birthday, grow strong as an elephant. Grow old, but remain physically
strong. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Mr President, congratulations. June is also my month, and
1942 is also the year of my birth. So you are in very good company.

For me to make the statement, "I am an African" is superfluous. What I am
is obvious, because I carry within my veins, within my DNA, the genes of
the Khoi - the first nation of the southern tip of Africa. My patriotism
and love for my continent, Africa, comes naturally, Oom Boy. To link it to
political party affiliation is not only misleading, it is childish.

Ek is 'n bruin Afrikaanssprekende Afrikaan in hierdie Huis, saam met ander
bruin Engelssprekende Afrikane en talle bruin Xhosa-sprekende Afrikane. Dit
is `n infame leuen dat Bruinmense net Afrikaans of Engels as moedertaal
het. Talle in u eie party, Mnr die President, is bruin mense ...
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I am a coloured Afrikaans-speaking African in this House, together with
other coloured English-speaking Africans and many coloured Xhosa-speaking
Africans. It is a blatant lie that coloured people have only Afrikaans or
English as their mother tongue. Many in your own party, Mr President, are
coloured people ...]

... noba bathetha isiXhosa. [... even if they speak Xhosa.]

You can look at us. There may be different shades, because we also carry as
a people the nations of the world in our veins. But it is obvious that we
carry the same genes. The only difference is our languages and maybe some
cultural practices. May I then humbly submit to you, Mr President, that the
term African, as selectively used in the South African context to
determine, for example, quotas in the workplace, is not just a misnomer, it
is absolute nonsense. The tragedy is that this nonsense is once again used,
as in the days of apartheid, now in the days of affirmative action, to
discriminate between Africans and Africans on the basis of a language as it
is now prevalent, for example, in the Cape Town City Council, ruled by the
ANC-New NP, where thousands of so-called coloureds, either English or
Afrikaans-speaking Africans, will have to make way for the so-called
African component. This will be nothing but blatant discrimination based on
a misdirected and totally confused notion that you cannot be a true African
if Afrikaans or English is your mother tongue.

Dit is die verantwoordelikheid van die opposisie om diskriminerende
praktyke in elke sfeer van regering bloot te lê en die Regering op sy tone
te hou. Dit sal ons doen in die Nasionale Parlement sonder om toestemming
daarvoor te vra by die regerende party of by sy lakei, die Nuwe NP.

In die Noord-Kaap, die enigste provinsie waar die Nuwe NP die amptelike
opposisie is, sê die ANC-premier op 31 Mei 2003: "Omdat die opposisie 'n
bietjie swak is in die Noord-Kaap, in verband met die werk wat hulle doen
in alle gemeenskappe, sê ek dat dit is altyd 'n `problem' want die ANC-
lede, soos ek hulle vandag sien, laat hulle stilsit en nie die werk doen
wat hulle moet doen nie. En dit is 'n gevaar vir die ANC". (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is the responsibility of the opposition to expose discriminatory
practices in any sphere of government and to keep the Government on its
toes. This we will do in the national Parliament without asking permission
to do so from the ruling party or its lackey, the New NP.

On 31 May 2003 the ANC premier said in the Northern Cape, the only province
where the New NP is the official opposition: "Because the opposition in the
Northern Cape is a little bit weak with regard to the work that they are
doing in every community, I say that this is always a `problem' because the
ANC members, as I see today, allow them to sit still and not do the work
that they should be doing. And that is a danger to the ANC."]

So one of your own premiers, Mr President, says by implication that a
vibrant opposition is a stimulant for the ANC to perform. And I must
congratulate the ANC for their performance in driving back the frontiers of
poverty. It is no small achievement if a former ANC politician, after just
a few years in business, could buy property to the value of R4 billion in
cash. It is no small achievement when a few highly connected ANC members
could get their fingers greased in Nigerian oil under very questionable
circumstances. It is no small achievement when an ordinary ANC member, who
left Parliament in 1999, can approach a farmer in my area to buy a farm
worth more than R4 million, and give his diamond connections in Angola as
surety. Is the history repeated where, after liberation, a select few share
the family silver amongst themselves?

It is possible to use slogans and jargon to fool some of the Africans some
of the time. It is impossible to fool all the Africans all of the time. I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr President, Franz Fannon in
his book, Black Complexion, White Masks deals with this phenomenon. I will
not deal with that. [Applause.]

Meneer die President, dis vir my 'n voorreg om u geluk te wens met die
herdenking van u geboortedag. Ek wil vra dat God u sal seën en u die krag
sal gee. Die toekoms van hierdie land is in u hande, maar ek weet die
toekoms is ook in u hart. My gebed is dat God u sal seën, die krag gee, die
gesondheid sal gee dat u ons na beter hoogtes kan lei. Ek wil vra dat u ook
tyd sal maak vir u en u vrou om so bietjie in u besige program alleen te
kan wees. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr President, it is a privilege for me to congratulate you on the
anniversary of the day of your birth. I want to ask that God will bless you
and give you the strength. The future of this country is in your hands, but
I know the future is also in your heart. My prayer is that God will bless
you and give you the strength, and the health so that you could lead us to
greater heights. I want to ask that you will also make the time in your
busy programme for you and your wife to be alone together a little.]

You said some time ago that you are a Presidency at work to push back the
frontiers of poverty. In approaching the budget debate on the Presidency,
I've decided to take the approach suggested by a conservative businessman
who said to me you should not co-operate with Government, you should fight
them. And I asked if there was something I could fight Government about.

I decided to look at two aspects of your work with a very critical
approach. I decided to examine aspects of your vision of excellence in
governance for a better life for all by addressing the following: first of
all, bringing the President closer to communities in South Africa, and
secondly, supporting the increasing involvement of the President in
initiatives in Africa and internationally to contribute to economic
development, good governance and peace.

Mr President, you embarked on an imbizo programme as an outreach to meet
with communities throughout the country to determine how service delivery
is being experienced. In the North West, you visited agricultural, housing,
health, educational and community-driven projects, and viewed progress in
delivery of basic services, economic growth and development, and
improvements under which people live. You joined in a door-to-door social
security registration campaign.

As a result of your Presidential imbizo in the Free State, Lesedi Technical
High School has now received more than 30 computers from the provincial
department of education and Telkom.

You have listened to the people of Bekkersdal in Gauteng. You saw the
effect of poverty in their lives. You acted immediately - a new initiative
to introduce the new echelon of community development workers into the
Public Service. Public works programmes will be introduced to create jobs
and transfer skills.

Mr President, in Limpopo province you heard the passionate plea by a
student on behalf of pupils, teachers and the community on their desperate
need for facilities and infrastructure. Since that imbizo an administration
block, an additional four classrooms and a laboratory have been
constructed, A borehole has been drilled, and computers and a photocopier
have been purchased.

In the limited time given to me, I want to deal with your initiatives in
Africa and internationally to contribute to economic development, good
governance and peace.

Mr President, in the last few months you travelled in Africa, and
internationally, where you represented South Africa and Africa. For the
first time we have leaders in this country that are supported by the
majority of South Africans, by the majority of the African countries, and
respected and hosted by the international communities.
Your approach to international engagement is guided by our unhappy
experiences, but also by a vision for the future that says: "The people of
Africa have said that the time has come for us to move out of and beyond
this terrible past. Our continent has said that the time has come that we
combine our forces to overcome this legacy and see Africa on a new path of
peace, stability, democracy and sustained progress and prosperity." This
was a statement by you at the Asian summit of the Non-aligned Movement
Business Forum.

What was said at Evian in France when the G8 leaders discussed the African
Action Plan? And I quote what they were saying about us: "We welcome the
important progress made by African partners in acting upon the values and
principles contained in Nepad, for example, in launching the African Union,
which underscores the will of African leaders to assure joint
responsibility for democracy, human rights, peace and stability and good
governance throughout the continent."

Financial assistance by the G8 has increased. Certain countries have in
fact doubled their contributions. Mr President, you have played a leading
role in all this. There are still challenges to meet - some are in Africa,
and we are dealing with the conflict, but many are about perceptions in the
international community. It is very unfortunate that we still have certain
political parties and groups within the media in this country that only
speak about the problems, and not about the revolutionary progress that we
have made. I do not have time to deal with your entire programme for this
year, but members of the media should visit the websites of the Department
of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency.

In conclusion, Mr President, you have done well. You have a busy programme.
I have to fight with you about one thing: you need to elect a better union,
Mr President. Your salary package is bad for all the work you do. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Deputy Speaker, hon President, Deputy President,
and hon members, firstly I would like to wish the hon President a happy
birthday and wish him well.

The Presidency aims to improve the lives of all citizens. In order to do
this, it has to focus on strengthening strategic leadership and the
organisational structure of the Presidency to ensure better planning and
service delivery in Government. It has to develop tools and institutional
arrangements that will result in better planning, co-ordination and the
integration of government policies and programmes.

One of the priorities of Government, where integration is seen, is the
issue of HIV/Aids. As one doctor said in a letter in the book Positive
Health, HIV and Aids has been given such a negative and fearful face that
being invisible is the best way to cope with this infection. When hope and
desire are taken away, the life force dissipates, opening the self to
disease and death. To give back hope and desire is the greatest of gifts
and this is what Positive Health does in the simplest of ways. Taking
control of the self, relying on the self and being able to survive, dream
and flourish is the mission of this little booklet. I would encourage every
member in this House to read this booklet and to take it to members of your
constituency.

We keep hearing members from the DA asking what Government is doing. One
wonders if they just do not know, read or hear anything about what
Government is doing. [Laughter.] What Government is doing about HIV and
Aids is set out in a five-year strategic plan, which is in line with
international trends and is the best in the world. The aim of this plan is
to provide a framework for a co-ordinated response to HIV/Aids at all
levels of society. The plan is structured according to the following four
areas: prevention; treatment, care and support; human and legal rights; and
monitoring, research and surveillance.

Government programmes that are in place are: the mother-to-child programme;
a voluntary testing and counselling service; the distribution of condoms;
promoting safe sexual behaviour through information, and the Integrated
Nutrition Programme, which is directed at women and children to fight HIV
and Aids. For the ANC, it is important that we strengthen and accelerate
the implementation of the National Aids Strategy, as amplified in the
Cabinet's statement of 17 April 2002.

The GCIS is also intensifying and expanding the communication campaign in
line with Government policy and programmes addressing problems of
implementation, and improving our approach in line with changing
circumstances.

I read about Aids in 1988, but we know that prior 1994 the response to
HIV/Aids was very limited. The tide has turned. In 1994 it was the ANC
Government who placed a clear emphasis on the effort to address HIV/Aids in
our country. In 2000 the South African National Aids Council was
established to formalise multisectoral collaboration. This council is
represented by civil society sectors, Cabinet Ministers and two
representatives from Parliament, and is chaired by the hon Deputy
President.
The establishment of Sanac was also instrumental in ensuring that sectors
outside of Government have a clear understanding of the strategic plan, and
their specific roles and responsibilities in implementation.

I spoke to a community health nurse focusing on HIV/Aids issues and TB. She
said that the biggest problem around HIV/Aids is that people do not want to
talk about it. There is a great shroud of secrecy around HIV/Aids. The only
way that the health community can really help people is if they come
forward to get tested, admit that they have HIV or Aids and talk about it.
Together with secrecy goes stigmatisation. I often read about women who
have Aids, and were thrown out of their homes by their husbands or
partners. The family of the husband also chased them out. Often the woman
got infected through the husband and people do not want to admit to that.
Families do not want to admit or talk about it. The community must talk
about it. We hear of the husband and children dying of Aids, but the hurt
and the harm have already been done. Women and children are thrown out of
their homes. We, as members of Parliament, when performing constituency
work where we meet with people of the community must also talk about
HIV/Aids and encourage others to go for testing and talk about it as well.

The ANC believes in working to mitigate the impact of Aids by rooting out
discrimination and stigma against infected and affected people by building
psychosocial support, providing essential medical care, providing support
for families, caring for people living with Aids and orphans and developing
effective workplace programmes.

The same nurse also said that we have a big problem about condoms. Parents
need to come out and talk to their children about condoms, the need for the
use of condoms and also about the consequences of unsafe sex and Aids.

The GCIS states that promoting public awareness and life skills is the core
of the efforts to prevent transmission of HIV. We have achieved a high
level of awareness - over 90%- which is beginning to have an impact
especially amongst the youth. But we need to ensure that more people
translate awareness into a change in lifestyle.

The GCIS also mentions that the positive and co-operative response from all
sectors to recent communication by Government on HIV/Aids is very
encouraging. We need to read about what our Government is doing about
HIV/Aids in the newspapers regularly, if they report the issue correctly.

Our President attached priority to HIV/Aids through different programmes;
in the same way women's issues are also prioritised in the Office of the
Presidency, because that is where the Office on the Status of Women is
located.

The vision of the OSW is to develop an enabling environment that will
guarantee gender equality, empowering women to gain equal access to
opportunities and resources that will enhance the quality of their lives.
The role of the OSW is to co-ordinate and facilitate the implementation of
Government policies and programmes on gender. The work is to advance
Government towards gender equality.

During the apartheid years there was nothing much for women. Women were
considered as inferior and did not enjoy rights of their own, as women.
Rural women suffered a triple burden. In spite of the discrimination women
faced and being the most disadvantaged section of the population, women
constitute over half of the population. On the basis of gender, women are
therefore the majority of the population in South Africa. If we want to
talk about a better life for all and a people-centered development,
progress we make must be measured by the impact of our programmes on the
social transformation of women.

It is the ANC and its allies who fought for the equality of all sections of
South African society, irrespective of race, sex, culture or religion. It
is the ANC-led Government who has set up laws to address the issue of women
and equality that gives women of our country a new legal platform from
which to proceed as they continue to struggle for their emancipation.
Legislation, such as the Bill of Rights, gives equal rights to all and
outlaws discrimination against anyone on the basis of gender. Other
legislation includes the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act, Act 4 of 2000; the Employment Equity Act, Act 5 of
1998; the Preferential Procurement Policy Act, and the Commission on Gender
Equality Act, Act 39 of 1996.

There are inconsistencies and a lack of co-ordination in applying
Government policy to targeted groups across the three spheres of government
and the private sector. Therefore it is important that the OSW and the
Gender Commission have the necessary capacity to carry out their work. They
must assist government institutions to integrate the issue of gender
equality and women's emancipation in all programmes.

In SADC we should set an example in terms of the SADC declaration, which
states that there should be a greater representation of women in the public
and private sector. The tide has turned because today South Africa stands
proudly amongst democracies with the highest number of women in Parliament
- more than 30%. [Applause.]

Nine Cabinet Ministers and eight Deputy Ministers are women. There has been
a woman as Speaker of the National Assembly since 1994, and the Deputy
Speaker and the Chairperson of the NCOP are women. It is not necessary for
me to remind the opposition that they are ANC members. The highest
proportion of women MPs, Ministers and Deputy Ministers is largely as a
result of the ANC policy which adopts the one-third quota for its electoral
list.

Just as we have many members of Parliament with disabilities, so we have
many women MPs. I challenge the opposition to try - I emphasise ``try'' -
and match the 30% of members being women in their political parties.

A significant number of women occupy important political and civil service
positions in provincial and local administration. Changes in these spheres
have been accompanied by visible improvement with regard to responsiveness
of service delivery to the needs of women and society as a whole. Women
also head more than 10% of South Africa's diplomatic missions. More still
needs to be done in the judiciary and private sectors.

My fear is that if the DA even had the remote possibility of being in
Government, all this would never have happened, as they don't even have one
third women MPs in Parliament.

We are also proud that South Africa has signed and ratified a number of
international agreements that impact directly on the lives of women, such
as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women; the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Beijing Platform
of Action. Twenty-six human rights international agreements have also been
signed by South Africa.

Poverty is still a problem in South Africa. All departments are working on
poverty eradication. We need to overcome the scourge of poverty and
underdevelopment. There is a need to improve the conditions of the lives of
our women, both in rural and in urban areas. The ANC highlights issues of
entrenching democracy, building a nonracial society and eradicating poverty
because of their relevance to our challenge to build a nonsexist society.

Deputy Speaker, the ANC supports Budget Vote No 1, as it is the task of the
Presidency to continue to assess the levels of integration, and conduct
annual reviews on budgeting and programmes, and therefore push back the
frontiers of poverty and make a better life for all our people in South
Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb President, dit is ook my bede dat die nuwe lewensjaar
vir u baie seën, vreugde en genade sal inhou. [Hon President, my prayer is
also that the new year in your life will bring you much blessing, joy and
grace.]

Madam Deputy Speaker, the President neatly defined the economic challenges
facing South Africa when he spoke at the Growth and Development Summit. Our
remarkable annual economic growth rate of 3% will have to be accelerated to
at least 5% to be able to reduce the 40% unemployment rate and cut poverty
in half by the year 2014. These goals can only be achieved by further
cultivating an economic climate conducive to growth and job creation.
Social grants serve as safety nets to prevent people unable to fend for
themselves from suffering. Only job creation can, however, overcome
poverty. We need to encourage entrepreneurship to provide the necessary
number of entrepreneurs who can create the jobs we need, especially from
the previously disadvantaged communities.

The envisaged expanded public works programmes will provide many job
opportunities for unemployed people, but will also cultivate
entrepreneurship, big and small. This is the right thing to do. The drastic
increase in the number of learnerships for the private and Government
sectors will result in improved skills, increased productivity in the
existing labour force and the empowerment of the unemployed to enter the
labour market successfully. These few policy statements, I think, pave the
way to a successful solution to the poverty problem in our country.

Black economic empowerment and affirmative action are essential components
of growth and development and are fully supported by the New NP. The labour
force in both the public and private sectors needs to reflect the racial
and gender composition of our people if we want South Africa to succeed.
Criticism about aspects of black economic empowerment and affirmative
action has been voiced lately. Black business leaders expressed concern at
the alarming rate at which major empowerment companies are reverting to
white control. In some companies there has been little transfer of skills.
Mr Moeletsi Mbeki is of the opinion that the current formula for
empowerment creates a culture of entitlement rather than empowerment. It
mostly amounts to the transfer of assets to individuals with good political
connections, without the accompanying skills enhancement.

Affirmative action, it is reported, frequently means the appointment of
people to senior positions without them being empowered with the necessary
skills or experience to cope with the associated responsibilities. The
emphasis of black economic empowerment and affirmative action has to shift
from entitlement to achievement. Appointments and promotions have to be
based on merit, not race or gender. People from previously disadvantaged
communities should rather be equipped with the appropriate skills to
compete and participate successfully in all levels of the economy. A much
more encompassing, integrated and co-ordinated education and training
programme has to be put in place to achieve this goal.

Medium and small enterprises contribute in a major way towards job creation
and economic growth in many modern economies. This is not true for South
Africa. Here small business is still perceived as bad business. We need a
paradigm shift in our perception of the role SMMEs need to play in growth
and development. Small business faces some daunting obstacles, such as a
rigid labour market where collective bargaining may only take place between
big business and big labour. Small employers are not allowed to bargain
with their own employees on issues like minimum wages and working
conditions. There is a hostile environment in which microfinance
entrepreneurs are simply bullied into oppression by big banks, an
overregulated environment of miles and miles of Government red tape that
scares small entrepreneurs from entering the business arena and a serious
lack of skills that leads to the failure of too many small enterprises.

Small business urgently has to be empowered for the war on poverty by
liberating entrepreneurship from ignorance, liberating small business from
overregulated labour markets, liberating microlenders from unfriendly
financial markets and liberating small business from the stranglehold of
the overregulated environment it has to operate in. If we are serious about
the task ahead, we will attend to these items.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before we proceed, I want to
respond to the request made by the hon Mr Leon to make a personal
explanation in terms of Rule 69(1). I have had an opportunity to consult
Hansard. The claim made by the hon Minister Pahad was that the hon Mr Leon
had never said anything in this Parliament about the millions who died in
the DRC, Rwanda, Burundi and Angola. The hon Mr Leon refuted this, saying
he had addressed in the House the issues the hon Minister had raised.

I want to inform hon members that Rule 69(1) provides an opportunity for a
personal explanation only if, during debate, a member's speech has been
misquoted or misunderstood. It does not provide an opportunity to refer to
speeches made at other times in other debates. The hon Mr Leon's request in
terms of Rule 69(1) can therefore not be accommodated. I shall study the
Hansard and come back to the House with a ruling if any other matters
require a follow-up.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, Comrade President, Comrade Deputy
President, hon members and comrades, I rise to support this budget, but
permit me to preface my remarks by recalling the words of a gifted African
musician and poet:


  See the gathering rain clouds rise from the steaming hope of loving
  hearts. Warm beat, drum, drum, drum; too long the tongue has tried, nay
  dried; The patient desert waits, see the bodies fall like raindrops
  nurtured deep love-dust root intention. Now, unveiled, the Karoo blooms
  again, joyous comes the golden flowers, purple shrubs and sunsets green.
  What shall quench our burning thirst? Let me drink, let me drink, let me
  drink from thee, oh, beautiful Africa, forever his perpetual wisdom,
  succulent, sustenance, sustains my song. Water, water, water from an
  ancient well. Oh, beautiful Africa, that's where I will always dwell.
  Water, water, water from an ancient well.

An ancient well plumbs the sands at an oasis on the edge of the Sahara in
the medieval kingdom of Sangai, where an African mother drew cool water
from the bowels of the earth, for the desert-parched traveller to slake his
thirst. With the passage of time, the oasis took on her name, Buktu, to be
known ever since as Timbuktu, or Buktu's Place.

Buktu's Place evolved into a village as farmers, traders and calvespersons
settled around it. As the population living around the oasis grew, the
village became a town and eventually a city with its own markets, schools,
mosques, a university and a growing library.

Situated in the crossroads between the eastern and western savannah and
along the camel routes that connected the Mediterranean with the Gulf of
Guinea, Timbuktu became a prosperous centre of learning where scientists,
mathematicians, physicians and philosophers congregated to practise their
craft and to hone their skills. They preserved the results of the
experiments and recorded their work and their thoughts in leather-bound
manuscripts which have survived the ages.

These have recently come to international attention thanks to the
intervention of Comrade President Thabo Mbeki, who has lodged an appeal for
funds to rescue these treasures from Africa's golden age from the termites
and elements that threaten to reduce them to a pile of dust.

Renaissance Africa can today claim its rightful place among the ancient
civilisations that are contributing to the corpus of humankind's shared
patrimony of achievements in the sciences, the humanities, the arts and
technology. But, rather than taking refuge in Africa's glorious past,
knowledge of our ancestors' achievements should spur us to tackle the
challenges of the present, by embarking on a continental cultural revival
that entails the spread of literacy, numeracy, a remastering of the
sciences and modern technology to improve the quality of life on our
continent.

The pursuit of the African Renaissance is the lodestar of South Africa's
domestic and foreign policy. The immediate goals of this policy thrust are
pushing back the frontiers of poverty, led by a developmental state
pursuing a sustainable economic growth path. Our purpose is to create the
space for the countries of Africa and other developed countries to assume
responsibility for themselves, and to offer indigenously evolved agendas in
preference to those devised by outside powers. Nepad, a continental
programme, in whose conception South Africa had a leading role, has now
been embraced by two successive G8 summits as well as the Asian countries.

South Africa has attained a respected place in the councils of the world,
thanks to the vision and the energy with which our President has sought out
opportunities and made appropriate interventions to create new ones.

First, as Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, South Africa helped
transform a forum among the developing countries that had emerged during
the Cold War into an international body that still has relevance. As
Chairman of the Commonwealth, Comrade President, you were in a position to
assist that forum, which many regarded as a relic of British imperialism,
into making itself relevant to the challenges of the 21st century.
When South Africa was honoured by election to the chairmanship of the
African Union, you employed that prestige to reposition the African
continent in world affairs through judicious interventions in the councils
of the world.

When we hosted the World Summit on Sustainable Development, our country was
amongst those that pressed for the adoption of a programme for the
eradication of poverty with agreed targets and timeframes. The Johannesburg
Declaration adopted by the WSSD will go down in the annals as a significant
departure that marked the international community's acceptance that we have
a shared responsibility for the future of our planet.

If there are inordinate international demands on the President of South
Africa today, that is because this ANC Government has extricated our
country from the pariah status it had acquired under apartheid.

Deputy Speaker, this year, 2003, also marks the 60th anniversary of the
adoption of the African Claims - a programmatic statement adopted by the
ANC at its annual conference in 1943, applying the principles of the
Atlantic Charter to the African continent. The African Claims has been
described as a precocious human rights document in that they anticipate
many of the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights by five years.

It should be a matter of pride to the ANC and to South Africa that in the
midst of the carnage of World War II, our country was able to produce so
visually a statement on human rights that remains relevant even today;
perhaps, especially today. The African Claims unequivocally called for full
and equal rights for women at a time when policy-makers in many parts of
the world were readying social policies and programmes devised to persuade
women to leave the workplace and to resume a role of domesticity as
submissive housewives and homemakers.

The 60th anniversary of the African Claims therefore poses a challenge to
Africa in our day, and especially to African men, when indigenous culture
and hollow claims of authenticity are being employed as a cover for the
perpetration of gross barbarities.

African men cannot remain silent when an African woman, Amina Lawal of
Nigeria, lives under the threat of being stoned to death. No amount of
sophistry can disguise that this is inexcusable barbarity. [Applause.] No
appeal to tradition, religious or secular, will mask the medieval savagery
of such a sentence. That an African court can even contemplate passing such
a sentence on another human being, no matter what the transgression, is a
blight on the countries of our continent. We dare not remain silent while
African womanhood is assailed in this manner. [Applause.]

Once again I want to appeal to you, Comrade President, to use your good
offices to draw to the attention of your Nigerian counterpart the profound
concern all South Africans have regarding this matter. [Applause.]

Statistics indicate that women on the African continent outnumber men by a
small margin. The future of the continent to that measure reposes on the
future we create for the African girl-child. Is it not time that African
men turn their backs on traditions and customs that seek to reduce the
African women to child-rearing beasts of burden, fit only to be chained to
their stoves, but shut off from the wonders of the modern world?

In South Africa we are trying, but even we still have a long way to go. The
African Claims quite correctly affirm that an end to racial, religious and
political intolerance are prerequisites for world peace. It was in that
spirit that Comrade Thabo Mbeki embarked on the Spear Initiative in an
attempt to assist the two parties to the Middle East conflict to find each
other through negotiation. It should be clear to anyone with eyes that the
tit-for-tat-cycle of violence we have witnessed over the last week is a
blind alley that can only end in mutual destruction.

The great tragedy of the Middle East is that each side has allowed itself
to become the hostage of the irreconcilables. This applies particularly to
Israel, whose Prime Minister seems determined to undermine the credibility
of whomever emerges as the head of the Palestinian authority. The Spear
Initiative is not an attempt to export a South African negotiating model to
the Middle East. I do not think there is anyone amongst us so arrogant as
to believe that ours is the model that fits all sizes and is appropriate
for all situations of conflict.

It is, rather, an attempt to demonstrate that mutal demonisation creates
closed minds and is the most fundamental blockage to a search for peace. It
seeks also to assist the warring parties to the recognition that confidence-
building necessarily entails risks, but these are risks with huge dividends
attached. It is our earnest hope that you shall persevere in these efforts,
Comrade President, not as a substitute or as an alternative to the road map
to peace, but as one of many complementary efforts to facilitate that
process.
South Africa has invested a great deal in an effort to secure peace and
stability on the African continent. Even as we speak, South African troops
are engaged in peacekeeping missions in various parts of the continent and
a detachment of the SANDF is deployed in Burundi as a protective service to
assist the government of that country to restore stability within its
borders.

The principle that government should derive authority from the consent of
the government is still bitterly contested in many parts of our continent.
We will be obliged to persuade many political players on the continent that
democratic institutions and accountable government are not privileges, but
inherent rights of all citizens. Politics, too, cannot be regarded as a
zero-sum game, but must be pursued with the aim of producing win-win
situations which benefit the ordinary citizen, and not rival political
parties or factions.

The Pan-African Parliament can serve as a forum where such discourse can
take place in an atmosphere of calm debate, characterised by a common
desire to arrive at consensus. In our continued interaction with the
political parties in Zimbabwe, we must continue to stress the rule of law,
political tolerance, the independence of the judiciary and the abiding
values of democracy, for which the National Liberation Movement waged a
struggle.

As we have done in every other country on our continent, our purpose
remains clear: South Africa does not seek to impose solutions; our role is
to assist the Zimbabweans to arrive at solutions themselves. The recent
endorsement of this approach by the British Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack
Straw, should be instructive.

President George Bush referred to the recent US-UK war against Iraq as the
first war of the 21st century. I am certain - and all of us in this august
House hope - it is not a portent of things to come.

At the beginning of the 20th century, another invasion, not dissimilar to
that of Iraq, the suppression of the Yu Hei Tuan or Boxer Rebellion in
China, was conducted by a similar coalition of the willing. Then, too, a
gaggle of carpetbaggers, eager to exploit the rich spoils, descended on
China under the pretext that they were the bearers of enlightenment and
modern institutions.

On that occasion too public opinion in the invading countries was brow-
beaten and confused with disinformation and half-truths that made them
believe that China posed a terrible threat, not only to those that had
invaded her, but to humanity as such. It is pathetically interesting to
observe that the phrase "yellow peril" was coined by Kaiser Wilhelm on the
occasion of the suppression of the Boxers.

Madam Deputy Speaker, while everyone appreciates the profound shock the
September 11 attacks represented for the people and the government of the
United States, those dastardly deeds cannot be employed as an alibi for the
abrogation of well-established international law by the United States and
its allies. [Applause.]

Apart from the fact that Iraq was in no way implicated in those attacks,
the justification for the war, disarming Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction, is becoming increasingly threadbare as US-UK armed forces fail
to uncover any of these, despite nearly 10 weeks of searching.
[Interjections.]

The international political environment has been dangerously poisoned by
the invasion of Iraq. It cannot be in the interests of South Africa and
other small developing nations that superpowers have carte blanche to
invade and conquer weaker countries at will. I doubt that the world is now
a safer place because Baghdad had been invested by US and UK troops. A
return to unilateralism, gunboat diplomacy and an ethic that might is right
will only serve to undermine the fragile international order established
after the defeat of the Axis powers 58 years ago.

We therefore urge all countries to help strengthen the multilateral
institutions of world governance. [Applause.] Collective security, built on
mutual responsibility for world peace, remains the wisest course. South
Africa should therefore continue striving for the strengthening of the
United Nations and the reform of its Security Council.

The ancient wells of African wisdom and past achievement will continue to
inspire us as we confidently stride into the future, but our own people and
those of the rest of the continent today thirst for the fresh, clean,
reticulated waters of modernity and progress, clean water that will nourish
their hopes and give them the strength to strive for the realisation of
their dreams.

In supporting this budget, the ANC remains confident that the path that you
and your Cabinet are charting, Comrade President, will indeed push back the
frontiers of poverty as we strive for a better life for all our people
within a better world. [Applause.]

Lastly, let me congratulate you on joining the ranks of the over-sixties.
Happy Birthday, Zizi. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: That concludes the business of the day. The
President will reply tomorrow.

Debate interrupted.
