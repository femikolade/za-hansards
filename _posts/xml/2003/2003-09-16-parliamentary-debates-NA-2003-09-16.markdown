             CONGRATULATIONS TO HESTRIE CLOETE AND RETIEF GOOSEN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House congratulates -


  (1) Hestrie Cloete on being named the Best Female Athlete of 2003 by  the
       International Association of Athletic Federations, following her gold
       medal win at the World Athletics Championships where  she  broke  the
       women's high jump world record during her dream season that  saw  her
       winning 21 of the 25 events for which she entered; and


  (2) Retief Goosen on winning the Lancôme  Trophy  played  in  Versailles,
       France, as his first major tournament win this year.

Agreed to.

     COMPLETION OF TASK BY AD HOC COMMITTEE ON GENERAL INTELLIGENCE LAWS
                               AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  on  behalf  of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the  draft  resolution  printed
in his name on the Order Paper, as follows:
  That, with reference  to  the  resolution  adopted  by  the  House  on  2
  September 2003,  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  General  Intelligence  Laws
  Amendment Bill is to complete its task by  no  later  than  25  September
  2003.

Agreed to.

                            WTO MEETING IN CANCUN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C T FROLICK (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  we  note  the  intransigence  of  the
developed countries during  the  ministerial  meeting  of  the  World  Trade
Organisation held in Cancun in Mexico regarding the  more  equitable  system
of international trade and investment;  and  note  the  huge  demonstrations
mounted by farmers, peasants and activists from Mexico and other  developing
countries  supported  by  large  numbers  of  concerned  citizens  from  the
developed countries themselves.  We  recommend  and  commend  the  important
unity displayed by the G20+  countries  and  the  critical  role  played  by
developing countries,  including  Argentina,  Brazil  and  South  Africa  in
refusing to be bullied by the developed countries.

We condemn in the strongest terms the attitude of  the  governments  of  the
developed countries, whose greed for profits has caused the collapse of  the
WTO ministerial meeting. We congratulate our Government and the Minister  of
Trade and Industry for the sterling efforts at both Doha and  Cancun  in  so
ably championing the cause of the developing countries.

                       NEW NP POSTERS IN BLOEMFONTEIN

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr J T DELPORT (DA): Mevrou die Speaker, die Hooggeregshof  het  beslis  dat
die  Nuwe  NP  in  die  Bloemfonteinse  tussenverkiesing  hul   onbehoorlike
plakkate moet verwyder. Wat sê hierdie plakkate? In dramatiese wit en  swart
staan daar: ``DA teen doodstraf; DA vir aborsie''.

Dit is alles leuens. In boeretaal, die Nuwe NP lieg en bedrieg die  publiek.
[Tussenwerpsels.] En wat het dit in elk geval met  munisipale  sake  uit  te
waai? Hulle weet mos dat die DA doodstraf en aborsie  as  hoogs  persoonlike
en sensitiewe sake beskou en mense se sieninge hieroor  respekteer.  Dit  is
die beleid: elkeen moet voor sy eie  gewete  besluit.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Jy
het nie 'n gewete nie.

Daarom sal ons ook  berus  by  die  uitslag  van  'n  referendum.  Hoofsweep
Douglas Gibson en ek het by herhaling vir die doodstraf gevra.

Wat die Nuwe NP sê  is  onwaar  en  dít  nogal  nadat  die  NP-regering  die
doodstraf  in  1989  gestop  het  en  toegelaat  het  dat  die  Grondwet  so
geformuleer word dat die  doodstraf  as  ongrondwetlik  verklaar  word.  Die
plakkate is 'n vergeefse poging om die politieke doodstraf wat  die  kiesers
Woensdag gaan gee,  te  probeer  ontkom.  Daarvoor  offer  die  Nuwe  NP  sy
politieke  eerbaarheid  op.  Sies,  Marthinus!  Sies,   Boy!   Sies,   Inus!
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)
[Dr J T DELPORT (DA): Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court has  ruled  that  the
New NP must remove their unseemly posters in the  Bloemfontein  by-election.
What do these posters state? In dramatic black and white  they  state:  ``DA
against death penalty; DA for abortion''.

It's all lies. In plain language, the New NP is  lying  and  misleading  the
public. [Interjections.] And what  does  this  have  to  do  with  municipal
matters anyway? Of course they know that the DA regards  the  death  penalty
and abortion as highly personal and sensitive issues and  respects  people's
views in this regard. This is the policy: Each must decide according to  his
own conscience. [Interjections.] You don't have a conscience.  That  is  why
we would also abide by the outcome  of  a  referendum.  Chief  Whip  Douglas
Gibson and I have repeatedly asked for the death penalty.

What the New NP is saying is untrue, and this after the NP  government  even
ended the death penalty in 1989, allowing the Constitution to be  formulated
in such a way that the  death  penalty  was  declared  as  unconstitutional.
Those posters are a vain attempt at avoiding the  political  death  sentence
which the voters will be giving on Wednesday. That is what the  New  NP  has
sacrificed its political honour for. Sis, Marthinus! Sis, Boy! Sis, Inus!]

                    ILLEGAL TRADE IN SECOND-HAND VEHICLES

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Madam  Speaker,  thousands  of  imported  second-hand
vehicles, many of which come through the Durban harbour legally as  vehicles
in transit to neighbouring countries, are  being  smuggled  onto  the  South
African  market.  Many  of  these  vehicles  never  reach   their   intended
destinations but are given false chassis and  engine  numbers,  and  offered
for sale through local second-hand dealers.

It is illegal to import second-hand vehicles for  resale  in  South  Africa.
Some of these illegal vehicles are bought by people who have no  idea  of  a
particular vehicle's  origin  or  that  the  vehicle  could  be  confiscated
without compensation by the customs authority.

According to certain authorities the dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of
imported second-hand vehicles destined for neighbouring  countries  has  led
to an increase in the number of used  cars  coming  in  through  the  Durban
harbour. This has created opportunities for criminal activity, as there  are
also stolen vehicles coming in with the second-hand  imported  vehicles.  We
urge motorists to be aware when buying second-hand vehicles.  We  also  urge
the relevant authorities to find ways of  stopping  this  criminal  activity
from happening.

                             PEACE ON CONTINENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  yesterday  President  Thabo  Mbeki  and
Deputy President Jacob Zuma attended the regional Heads of State  Summit  on
Burundi in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. As facilitator  of  the  peace  process,
Deputy President Jacob Zuma presented a report on developments in the  peace
process. Mindful of the huge difficulties  and  the  patience  required  for
these efforts to succeed, the ANC commends the commitment of our  Government
to the achievement of peace on the continent. We  recognise  the  centrality
of peace in our  efforts  to  achieve  socioeconomic  developments  and  the
reconstruction of the continent. Further, we remain cognisant  of  the  fact
that our objective of poverty eradication  hinges  directly  on  whether  we
succeed in our peace efforts and the entrenchment of  democratic  processes.
We wish our President, the Deputy President and  all  the  leaders  involved
success in  this  profoundly  humane  and  noble  endeavour.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Before asking for the next statement,  hon  member  Delport,  I
wish to raise with you your statement. It was in order inasmuch as  whatever
you said applied to the New NP; in other words a political  party.  That  is
in  order.  However,  regarding  your  concluding  remarks  where  you  then
identified two individuals, ``Shame on you, Boy. Shame on you,  Marthinus.''
I assume one was a reference to somebody who is not a member of this  House.
The other is a reference to a member of this  House.  I  would  ask  you  to
withdraw that, please. [Interjections.] Just that part of it.

Dr J T DELPORT: Could I just get clarity, Madam Speaker. Which part am I  to
withdraw? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, at the end of your statement, you  concluded
by saying, ``Shame on you, Boy. Shame on you, Marthinus.'' And  it  is  that
part, inasmuch as it refers to a member of this House, that I  want  you  to
withdraw.

Dr J T DELPORT: I must withdraw the words ``Sies,  Boy''.  I  will  withdraw
the words ``Sies, Boy.''

The SPEAKER: Thank you, hon member.

              RULING OF THE BROADCASTING COMPLAINTS COMMISSION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Thank you, Madam Speaker.

Die Uitsaaiklagtes Kommissie van  Suid-Afrika  het  vandag  beslis  dat  die
verwysing  na  sommige  Afrikaanse  rugbyspelers  in  die  Springbokspan  as
``thick Dutchmen'' haatspraak is en 'n Kaapse radiostasie 'n boete  van  R10
000 opgelê het. Die Nuwe NP het dié klagte ingedien. Die Nuwe  NP  verwelkom
hierdie beslissing omdat dit nie aanvaarbaar is in die nuwe  Suid-Afrika  om
sekere gemeenskappe name te noem en aan te val nie. Hoewel die Nuwe  NP  die
vryheid van spraak as hoeksteen van die demokrasie ondersteun, kan  ons  nié
toelaat dat enige gemeenskap in 'n multikulturele samelewing  gestereotipeer
word nie. Omdat die Nuwe NP nasiebou en versoening as 'n  fokuspunt  van  sy
beleid  stel,  kan  ons  nie  toelaat  dat  hierdie  verdelende   opmerkings
onbeantwoord  gelaat  word  nie.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South  Africa  today  ruled  that
the reference to some Afrikaans rugby  players  in  the  Springbok  team  as
``thick Dutchmen'' was an example of hate speech and a  Cape  radio  station
was fined R10 000. The New NP lodged this complaint.  The  New  NP  welcomes
the decision since it is not acceptable in the  new  South  Africa  to  call
certain communities names and to attack them. Although the New  NP  supports
freedom of speech as the cornerstone  of  democracy,  we  cannot  allow  any
community in a multicultural society to be stereotyped.  Since  the  New  NP
regards nation-building and reconciliation as a focal point of  its  policy,
we cannot allow these divisive comments to go unanswered. I thank you.]

                THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR SEXUAL EXPERIMENTATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP): There is evidence of a worldwide  effort  to  lower  the
age when a child can legally give consent for  intercourse  with  an  adult.
This desire to  gain  access  to  children  has  resulted  in  many  intense
legislative struggles in Western nations and South Africa is  no  exception.
The ACDP has been the only  party  to  sound  the  alarm  in  South  Africa;
alerting the public to proposed legislation to  reduce  the  age  of  sexual
consent and permit sexual experimentation.

In terms of the Criminal  Law  (Sexual  Offences)  Amendment  Bill  children
between the ages of 12 and 16  years  are  permitted  to  engage  in  sexual
experimentation of a nonpenetrative nature with partners also below the  age
of 16. The age of consent for homosexual relations is to be lowered from  19
to 16 years for both genders.  Teenage  years  are  fraught  with  emotional
conflict as the transition from child to adult  is  made  and  our  children
need to be protected and guided rather than  encouraged  to  participate  in
homosexual and  heterosexual  sexual  experimentation  with  possible  life-
threatening consequences.  Whilst  not  oblivious  to  the  fact  that  many
children are sexually active, it is unacceptable that 12-  to  16-year-olds,
most of whom  will  not  have  reached  puberty,  should  be  vulnerable  to
exploitation under the guise of sexual experimentation.

Although many homosexual activists publicly deny that they  want  access  to
boys, homosexual groups around the world are working aggressively  to  lower
the age of consent. The  ACDP  believes  that  sexual  relations  should  be
celebrated within the institution of marriage. We are concerned  that  media
and loveLife campaigns in schools encourage sexual experimentation and  with
such legislation in place ... [Time expired.] Thank you.

                               COSATU CONGRESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N M NENE (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker. From 15 to 18  September  2003,
Cosatu holds its eighth national congress at Gallaghar  Estate,  Midrand  in
Johannesburg. We take this  opportunity  to  salute  Cosatu  for  its  long-
standing efforts at  organising  and  uniting  the  working  people  of  our
country. We salute Cosatu for the critical role it has played and  continues
to play within our revolutionary alliance. The people of South Africa  value
the  immense  contributions  that  Cosatu   continues   to   make   in   the
transformation of our country. Its commitment to voting for the ANC  in  the
2004 elections serves as a critical contribution in the struggle for  social
justice. The ANC wishes the brave and heroic  workers  of  our  country  and
their federation, Cosatu, a successful eighth congress. [Applause.]

                          WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P H K DITSHETELO (UCDP): The poor countries were  looking  to  the  World
Trade Organisation for fair treatment in terms of  trade.  Unfortunately  it
would seem that this expectation amounted to nothing but disappointment.  It
is unfortunate that things are not going according to plan and not  much  is
being  achieved  at  this  gathering.  This  is  a  bitter  lesson  for  the
developing countries, which  is  not  to  rely  so  much  on  the  developed
countries.

The issues of agriculture are the core of the problem. It is said  that  the
rich countries have sought to employ  tactics  that  make  it  difficult  to
reach a solution on key issues that impact directly on  the  development  of
weaker nations. As we know, the  African  countries  are  mainly  driven  by
agriculture. The  insistence  by  the  rich  countries  that  the  issue  of
subsidies for these farmers cannot be tackled at this forum in the  form  of
scrapping subsidies for developed countries, contributes to  inequality  and
biased trade relations between rich and poor nations.  The  situation  calls
for the World Trade Organisation  members  to  move  speedily  in  achieving
common ground on these issues. The  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  must
ensure ... [Time expired.]

                                   COSATU

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Hon Speaker, according to a report on the website of  News
24, and I  quote,  ``...  ululating,  cheering  members  of  Cosatu  chanted
slogans ... '' at their annual congress supporting  Deputy  President  Jacob
Zuma. Delegates sang a song denouncing National Prosecuting  Authority  head
Bulelani Ngcuka. ``Ngcuka uvulela impi,  ubiza  umlo!''  ["Ngcuka,  you  are
calling for war.''] sang the group outside  the  entrance  of  the  congress
venue.

Die NA beskou hierdie optrede van Cosatu as onverantwoordelik,  opruiend  en
'n populistiese bedreiging van die regtelike gesag en wet en orde  in  Suid-
Afrika. Dit blyk duidelik dat hierdie Cosatu-lede geen respek  het  vir  die
mees basiese beginsel van wet en orde in 'n demokratiese  staatsgestel  nie.
Die NA stel die volgende dringende vrae aan die leierskap van  die  ANC,  en
ons is bly sy voorsitter is hier  vandag.  Is  die  ANC  bereid  om  hom  te
distansieer van die strydkrete deur sy een groot bondgenoot? Sal die ANC  sy
beoogde   samewerking   in   die   komende   verkiesing   met   Cosatu    as
alliansievennoot in heroorweging neem in die lig  van  hierdie  optrede  van
Cosatu-lede indien hulle nie deur die leierskap van Cosatu tot  orde  geroep
is nie? Sal die staat in geval van genoegsame  getuienis  vervolging  instel
teen hierdie flagrante  viktimisasie  van  die  vervolgingsgesag  van  Suid-
Afrika?

Verder doen die NA 'n beroep op Adjunkpresident Zuma om in die lig  van  die
dreigende onstabiliteit rondom sy posisie die eerbare weg te volg en uit  sy
pos te bedank.  Ek  dank  u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The NA regards this action of Cosatu as irresponsible, inflammatory  and  a
populist threat to the judiciary and law and order in South  Africa.  It  is
clear that  these  Cosatu  members  have  no  respect  for  the  most  basic
principle of law and order in a democratic state. The NA wants  to  ask  the
leadership of the ANC the following important questions;  and  we  are  glad
that its chairman is here today. Is the  ANC  prepared  to  distance  itself
from the battle-cries by its one big ally? Will the ANC,  in  the  light  of
this action by  Cosatu  members,  rethink  its  intended  co-operation  with
Cosatu as its alliance partner in the  coming  elections  if  they  are  not
called to order by the leadership of Cosatu? Will the state institute  legal
proceedings in  the  case  of  sufficient  evidence  against  this  flagrant
victimisation of the prosecuting authority of South Africa?
Furthermore, the NA appeals to Deputy President Zuma, in the  light  of  the
threatening instability surrounding  his  position,  to  do  the  honourable
thing and resign from his position. I thank you. [Interjections.]]

                                   TOURISM

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C M P  RAMOTSAMAI  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  South  Africa's  tourism  has
increased  by  more  than  500%  in  the  past  10  years.  This  remarkable
development was confirmed by Conservation International  at  the  5th  World
Parks Congress in Durban. As we come closer to the conclusion of  our  first
decade of freedom, the beautiful fruits of our  freedom  and  our  democracy
are becoming more of a shared global  heritage.  The  world  is  discovering
continually the warmth of our  people,  the  beauty  of  our  land  and  our
preparedness to create a common home characterised by the spirit of  ubuntu.
Our significant success as a country in improving  tourism  will  contribute
greatly to our efforts aimed at job creation and pushing back the  frontiers
of poverty. Let us as South Africans  celebrate  the  achievements  we  have
made in our first decade of freedom.

Let us conserve our ecosystems, landscapes and wildlife,  and  our  positive
historical and cultural features. Let us  make  ours  a  better  country,  a
better Africa and a better world. I thank you. [Applause.]

         INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS REGARDING MR BULELANI NGCUKA

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv H C SCHMIDT (DA):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  lede  van  die  publiek  staan
verbaas en stomgeslaan oor die feit dat die  ANC  glo  ondersoek  instel  na
Bulelani Ngcuka se beweerde status as 'n spioen  van  die  vorige  regering,
maar stel nie ondersoek in ten opsigte van beweerde korrupsie aan  die  kant
van die Adjunkpresident nie. Die Huis moet kennis neem van die feit dat  die
kiesers nie onnosel is nie. Hulle besef te goed dat politieke stof  opgeskop
word om die aandag van die beweerde korrupsie af te lei.

Of meneer Ngcuka wel 'n spioen was in die ou dae is  natuurlik  interessant.
Dit het egter niks te doen met die feite om  die  Adjunkpresident  nie.  Wat
die publiek wil weet  is  hoekom  meneer  Zuma  absoluut  stilbly  in  plaas
daarvan om sy kant van die storie te  vertel.  Hy  het  mos  immers  nie  'n
verhoor nodig nie. Hy kan sy kant van die storie in die Parlement  of  selfs
by 'n mediakonferensie stel. Die hele land sal aan sy lippe  hang.  Ek  dank
u. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Adv H C SCHMIDT (DA): Madam Speaker, members of the  public  are  surprised
and dumbfounded by  the  fact  that  the  ANC  will  apparently  investigate
Bulelani Ngcuka's alleged status as a spy for  the  former  government,  but
will not investigate the alleged  corruption  on  the  part  of  the  Deputy
President. The House should take note of the fact that the  voters  are  not
stupid. They realise only too well that political dust is  being  kicked  up
in order to distract the attention away from the alleged corruption.

Whether Mr Ngcuka  was  in  fact  a  spy  in  the  old  days  is  of  course
interesting. However, that has nothing to do with the facts relating to  the
Deputy President. What the public would like to  know  is  why  Mr  Zuma  is
keeping absolutely quiet instead of telling his side of the story.  He  most
surely does not need a trial?  He  can  state  his  side  of  the  story  to
Parliament or even at a media conference. The whole country  would  hang  on
his lips. I thank you. [Interjections.]]

        PROPOSED TOLL ROAD COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF NEW PLANT SPECIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs L R MBUYAZI (IFP): Madam Speaker, a new plant species  falling  under  a
species known for its pharmaceutical  properties,  has  been  discovered  by
botanists working on the corridor of the proposed Wild Coast N2  toll  road.
This area combines ancient tropical shrubs and trees  with  species  derived
from the Cape vegetation, and it is reported that 1 800  plant  species  are
crammed into this area.

Prof Trevor Edwards of the School of Botany and Zoology  at  the  University
of Natal, who is studying this species, believes that it would  be  reckless
to lose this plant to the proposed toll road before  it  is  actually  known
how pharmaceutically useful this plant could be.

It is therefore our wish that all stakeholders who are affected by the  toll
road project work together  and  protect  this  plant  to  exhaust  the  due
medical research process for the common good of all of us. Thank you.

                          PROTECTION OF OZONE LAYER

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MAUNYE (ANC): Madam Speaker, 16 September has been proclaimed by  the
United  Nations  General  Assembly  as  the  International   Day   for   the
Preservation of the Ozone Layer.

We observe this day to commemorate the  signing  in  1987  of  the  Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The  depletion  of  the
ozone layer endangers all life on earth.  It  is  therefore  important  that
industries  ultimately  cease  all  production  and  consumption  of  ozone-
depleting substances as outlined under the Montreal Protocol.

The ANC calls on all of humanity to plan focused efforts  aimed  at  raising
public, industry and government awareness of issues on ozone  depletion.  As
this year's theme says: Let us save our sky. There is a whole  lot  more  to
do for our children. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

                               DA-IFP ALLIANCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS  (New  NP):  Speaker,  I  rise  to  comment  on  what  was
announced in the media as the looming marriage between the IFP and  the  DA.
I am referring  of  course  to  a  possible  formal  co-operation  agreement
between these two parties. Now, if parties  want  to  form  a  united  front
against the ANC, it is their democratic right  to  do  so.  [Interjections.]
But what I find very hard to understand is how a  party  like  the  IFP  can
simultaneously sit comfortably in the Government of the ANC  rulers  and  in
the caucus of  the  official  opposition.  [Applause.]  I  find  this  mind-
boggling. You can't have your political cake and  eat  it.  [Interjections.]
Somewhere along the line the IFP will have to make an important choice.

En skielik word hierdie samewerkingsooreenkoms voorgehou as  'n  alternatief
vir die ANC-regering, maar dit is nie wat  die  jongste  meningspeilings  sê
nie; A C Nielsen bevind dat as daar môre 'n verkiesing gehou word,  kry  die
DA 6,7% steun en die IVP 2,4%. En as mens nog die 1% by tel van die VF,  wat
hulle ook by die alliansie  wil  aansluit,  is  dit  9,1%.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[And  suddenly  this  co-operation  agreement  is  being  proffered  as   an
alternative to the ANC Government, but that is not what the  latest  opinion
polls say; A C Nielson has found  that  if  an  election  were  to  be  held
tomorrow, the DA would receive 6,7% support and the IFP  2,4%.  And  if  one
were to add the 1% of the FF, which also wants  to  join  the  alliance,  it
would be 9,1%.]

It is no alternative for the ANC at all. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order,  hon  members!  There  is  time  for  ministerial
responses, but I don't see any Minister whose portfolios were referred to.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, if I may, I'm available to speak  on
behalf  of  all  of  my  colleagues  who  aren't  here,  even  for   myself.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: No. You're not called upon to do so.

Hon Minister Asmal. There was no question referring to education.

                  SEX EDUCATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: There was, Madam  Speaker.  With  great  respect,
the hon Dudley referred to sex education of young  people  in  schools,  and
that is  very  central  to  our  national  curriculum  strategy.  With  your
permission, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: You may deal with that issue.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you. I have no doubt that  the  hon  Dudley
is a very decent person. I have no doubt that she is a sincere  person,  but
she lacks compassion. She lacks understanding in  everything  she  says  and
does about young people.

The idea of amending the age of marriage followed a  law  reform  commission
report. That young people develop earlier now than in her  time  and  in  my
time, that there are enormous pressures on them and an  enormous  amount  of
precocious  sexual  activity  are  all  ideas  that  seem  to  pass  her  by
altogether. It is vital therefore for this House to  recognise  that  if  we
want to reach out to young people,  we  should  recognise  their  needs  and
their development,  how  they  develop  and  when.  I  ask  the  hon  Dudley
therefore not to be obsessed by a particular approach, which will  not  help
young people grow and develop.

It is vital that we understand that young people understood about  HIV/Aids,
according to the Mandela Report, because of the school system; and that  the
incidence of HIV/Aids in  young  people  is  tapering  off  because  of  the
successes of the school system.

I claim nothing from loveLife; I am not involved in that. They  have  shaken
up the understanding of young people. As for yourselves, I look  forward  to
the support of the hon Dudley  when  we  involve  our  schools  in  sexology
education, which is the only way of  dealing  with  violence  against  women
and, of course, precocious sexual activity. Thank you very much.

        MEMBER'S STATEMENT ON POSSIBLE DA-IFP CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker and hon members,  I  was  rather
astounded by the statement that was made by Dr Geldenhuys  because,  in  the
first place, when  President  Mandela  invited  us  to  participate  in  the
Government of National Unity in 1994, it was the New NP ...

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, I must ask ...

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: ... they chickened out of that.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, please! This time is only for  responses  in  the
context of one's portfolio. I very much ...

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: I thought I had  the  right  to  correct  some
twaddle from a member of Parliament. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER:  Hon  Minister,  I  am  sure  you  will  be  able  to  find  an
opportunity to speak  in  the  many  debates  today,  and  deal  with  that.
[Interjections.] I do regret it, but I am afraid I have to  apply  the  same
thing that I applied to Mr Lekota, who  was  also  wanting  to  reply  at  a
political level.

                        NATIONAL PORTS AUTHORITY BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The SPEAKER:  I  now  welcome  and  call  the  hon  Minister  of  Transport.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Bill before  this
House has its origin  in  the  White  Paper  on  National  Commercial  Ports
Policy. It was adopted by Cabinet in March 2002, more than a year ago.

Commercial ports play a crucial role in South Africa's transport,  logistics
and socioeconomic development. It is interesting to note that 90%  of  world
trade is seaborne and  approximately  98%  of  South  Africa's  exports  are
conveyed by sea. These figures illustrate the point that  the  life  of  our
economy depends a great deal on ports.  Ports  play  a  vital  role  in  all
countries. Many people do not realise just how vital this role  is  for  the
health of the economy. A country's ports are at the same  time  a  barometer
of its integration into the world  or  global  marketplace  and  a  critical
support system for its international trade.

The aim of the White Paper on National Commercial Ports  Policy,  therefore,
was to ensure affordable, internationally competitive,  efficient  and  safe
port  services,  based  on  the  application  of  commercial  rules   in   a
transparent and competitive  environment  applied  consistently  across  the
transport  system.  The  White  Paper  identified  that  an  efficient  port
required not only adequate  infrastructure,  superstructure  and  equipment,
but  also  good  communications,  information,  technology  systems  and   a
dedicated  and  skilled  management  team  with  a  motivated  and   trained
workforce.

The White Paper proposed that, in order to ensure that  our  ports  continue
to contribute to our international competitiveness, the  separation  of  the
port authority and port operation components will  give  additional  impetus
to ongoing efforts to upgrade facilities  and  equipment.  The  White  Paper
proposed the creation of a sector regulator for  ports  as  well.  The  port
reform process, therefore, is aimed at  improving  the  performance  of  the
port system, raising productivity, promoting black economic empowerment  and
mobilising private sector investment in the South African port system.

When Cabinet adopted the White Paper on National  Commercial  Ports  Policy,
this Parliament was set a critical  assignment.  It  is  the  assignment  of
providing a framework of law that can make the  policy  pronouncements  into
reality for our country. This Bill before  the  House,  therefore,  is  that
framework of law.

It heralds a new dawn for port regulation management operations.  It  places
us in a position to move speedily with implementation  of  the  port  reform
process. The objects of the Bill in a nutshell are to promote  transparency,
improve efficiency and performance in the management and operation of  ports
by  establishing  appropriate  institutional  arrangements  to  support  the
governance of ports and create an environment to facilitate the  development
of technology information systems and managerial expertise  through  private
sector  involvement  and  participation,  and  generally  to   promote   the
development of an integrated, regional production  and  distribution  system
in support of Government's policy.

The premise of the Bill is  port  efficiency,  regulation  and  empowerment.
This means  that  by  establishing  and  redefining  the  functions  of  the
national ports authority, we are confirming  that,  firstly,  the  authority
has the function to own, manage, control  and  administer  ports  to  ensure
their efficient and economic functioning. Although the  authority  will  not
be involved in operations, the authority has the overall  responsibility  as
an operator of last resort to do everything  reasonably  necessary  for  the
effective  and  economic  management  planning  operation  of  ports.   This
provision is in line with the best international  practice  to  empower  the
authority to exercise.

The Bill before the House has been carefully worked out to ensure  that  the
transition from the  authority  in  its  present  form,  as  a  division  of
Transnet, is carefully managed, whilst at the same  time  not  unnecessarily
delaying its ultimate exit from the Transnet  stable.  It  is  important  to
indicate that the Bill has been drafted so that throughout all these  stages
of the development of the authority, it enjoys the status of  the  authority
and is fully empowered to perform the function of the  authority  as  if  it
were the authority.

It is important for me to state  that,  throughout  the  entire  process  of
development of the authority, workers employed  by  the  authority  are  and
will be guaranteed  their  positions.  The  Bill  before  you  entrusts  the
Minister of Public Enterprises with the function to appoint the  members  of
the board of authority and to hold shares of  the  authority  on  behalf  of
Government. The board is fully  empowered  to  undertake  various  functions
and, amongst other authorisations, the authority will  approve  a  strategic
and business plan, approve  port  reform  measures  and,  most  importantly,
ensure  that  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  owned  by  historically
disadvantaged groups have an equitable opportunity  to  participate  in  the
operations of facilities in the ports environments.

The White Paper on National Commercial Ports Policy has identified the  need
for a port regulator with the main aim to regulate the  authority,  firstly,
to ensure impartiality and equity in the access to port services;  secondly,
to rule on any complaint by port users regarding  monopoly  pricing  on  the
part of the authority; and, thirdly, to monitor  the  business  relationship
between the authority and Transnet. And so the Bill  deals  with  all  these
various matters adequately, in my submission.
I would like to thank  the  portfolio  committee,  its  chairperson,  Jeremy
Cronin and  members  of  all  parties  who  participated  in  the  portfolio
committee for the very constructive discussions that  took  place  and  were
reported to me. Thank you for that, I think a very good product has  emerged
as a result of that process of interaction in the portfolio committee.

The Bill confirms then that ports are important to  our  country's  economic
growth and I just want to summarise the specific objectives of the  Bill  as
being, firstly, to provide for  the  establishment  of  the  national  ports
authority to  own,  manage  and  control  ports  on  behalf  of  the  state;
secondly, to provide for the transfer of ports, land and  other  rights  and
obligations from Transnet to the authority;  thirdly,  to  provide  for  the
establishment of the port regulators; fourthly,  to  ensure  equity  in  the
access to ports  facilities  in  a  nondiscriminatory  manner;  fifthly,  to
authorise the authority to enter into various forms of contracts,  including
concessions; sixthly, to provide for the licensing  of  ports  services  and
facilities; seventhly, to authorise the charging of fees; and  eighthly,  to
amend other laws that have a bearing on activities of ports.

Thank you to all those who participated and made  a  contribution.  I  would
like to indicate that  Government  has  been  having  discussions  with  the
labour sector with regard to  certain  of  the  concerns  of  labour.  Those
discussions have not been concluded,  they  are  taking  place  through  the
national framework agreement process and hopefully in  due  course,  shortly
after today, an agreement will be reached. I want to indicate  that  we,  as
Government, will go out of our way to address worker  concerns.  Thank  you,
Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Madam  Speaker,  South  Africa  has  seven  major  commercial
ports: Richards Bay, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth, Mossel  Bay,  Cape
Town, Saldanha and, obviously, Coega Port will also soon come on stream.

As we've begun to turn our  economy  around  in  South  Africa,  we've  also
noticed then that there are some bottlenecks,  including  within  the  ports
system. It's for this reason that Cabinet, and we very much  welcome  it  as
the portfolio committee, has announced recently a major  investment  in  the
ports system in terms of infrastructure. However, obviously,  we  also  need
to align the institutional  arrangements  as  well  to  support  this  major
investment in this critical strategic area of  our  economy.  That's  really
what this Bill, the National Ports Authority Bill, is about.

At the moment, the major public institution controlling the port  system  is
Transnet, and it does it through two divisions: the SAPO, which  is  the  SA
Port Operations  division,  which  handles  cargo  and  so  forth;  and  the
National Ports Authority.  Now,  when  you  are  dealing  with  handling  or
transporting freight, which is what we call  logistics,  there  are  several
challenges that inevitably crop up.

One  challenge  is  that  it's  very  important  to  handle  the  individual
components of the transport system effectively and efficiently. You need  to
look at rail; you need to look at your airports; you need to  look  at  your
customs handling and clearance; you need to look at  the  road  system  and,
obviously, also at sea ports. So each  one  of  those  things  needs  to  be
looked at carefully, but, at the same time, it's very important not to  lose
sight of the fact that you are dealing  with  a  system  that  needs  to  be
integrated and is sometimes not effectively integrated.

In some African ports - I'm happy to say not here in South  Africa,  but  in
some African ports - you have efficient  ships  arriving,  efficient  cranes
operating and then it takes 180 days, on  average,  to  move  the  container
from the port. That doesn't  really  help  if  the  system  is  not  working
effectively.

Another  challenge  that  comes  up  with  logistic   systems   like   this,
particularly if you are dealing with ports in South Africa, is that we  have
a very open economy, we depend on exports and imports. Something  like  98%,
I think, of our exports and imports travel through these sea ports, but  our
industrial heartland is deep in the interior of the country.

Therefore, when you talk about sea ports,  you  are  talking  about  a  very
important, strategic, national public asset. We can't just sell  it  off  to
Enron or some private company for profit. This is a national asset which  we
need to safeguard. It's very critical to economic growth and development  in
our country. At  the  same  time,  obviously,  you  are  dealing  with  very
important private sector players -  shipping  lines,  freight  handlers  and
many small businesses as well. Therefore,  to  achieve  integration  between
these is another major challenge.

Now, in trying to address this challenge in our own port system,  there  was
a White Paper, which the Minister referred to, and  the  first  draft  Bill,
which arrived at the committee stage at  the  beginning  of  this  year.  It
essentially identified, as the key institutional challenge, the  development
of a powerful, effective and stand-alone national port authority outside  of
Transnet.

When the Bill arrived, we had  an  explosion  in  our  very  first  hearings
because Transnet, quite rightly, expressed very, very strong concerns.  They
pointed out that over 50% of their existing revenues are derived,  actually,
at present, from the National  Ports  Authority,  and  taking  the  National
Ports Authority out of Transnet would have very grave consequences.

Now, generally, good sense prevailed. There was one private  sector  company
in one of our hearings which said that if  Transnet  can't  survive  without
the National Ports Authority, then we should let it go down.  But  that's  a
very shortsighted perspective from anyone's corner. If the  rail  system  in
South Africa collapses, it doesn't matter that your port system  is  working
well, because the whole system starts not to work.

Confronted with these challenges we sent the original draft  back  with  the
co-operation of the drafters from the Department of Transport.  We  sent  it
back and said that we really need to have a new  draft.  By  the  middle  of
this year we had a second draft Bill before us, which we  think  has  solved
the problem that Transnet presented us  with.  We  now  have  a  three-stage
process.

The National Ports Authority, at present, is  a  wholly  owned  division  of
Transnet. In a second moment it will become a Pty Limited  corporation,  but
owned by Transnet, within Transnet still. In the third phase it will  become
a stand-alone publicly owned  corporation  under  the  Minister  for  Public
Enterprises. So that was the first problem, and we think we have solved it.

The second problem has presented itself around Maydon  Wharf.  I  think  the
Minister of Home Affairs knows Maydon Wharf very well. It's an old  port  of
Durban harbour, and Durban port is the most important port in South  Africa.
In the Maydon Wharf area, because it's an old development,  there  are  many
problems. There are people there with leases  that  go  back  70  years  and
more. In some of the leases, there are strange  references  to  things  like
the Group Areas Act and so on, which is completely unacceptable.

The rentals are not very much market-related, but perhaps  the  key  problem
is that there are many people  sitting  on  Maydon  Wharf  currently,  doing
business which is completely unrelated to  ports  and  to  the  business  of
ports. We really need,  therefore,  to  transform  that  area  in  order  to
develop the port of Durban. So what we  have  done  in  the  Bill  is  this:
Originally, in the Bill, there was a Maydon Wharf chapter  which  said  that
the National Ports Authority would have  the  power,  when  public  interest
declared so, to renegotiate the leases or to cancel them where appropriate.

Now we accepted the idea behind it, but there were concerns raised from  the
committee,  correctly  so,  that  a  section  of  a  Bill   which   referred
specifically to Maydon Wharf  might  meet  with  Constitutional  challenges,
because it would be too restrictive.  So  what  we've  done  is  that  we've
preserved the intention but broadened the reference  -  so  it's  no  longer
just at Maydon Wharf, although that is the main target of the concern  -  to
a general reference empowering the National Ports  Authority,  where  public
interest prevails, to cancel or renegotiate leases that are  in  the  port's
environment.  Of  course,  in  broadening  this,  it  raised  concerns  from
shipping lines and the fishing industry  who  thought  that  they  were  all
being targeted by these new measures.

The third thing that we've done is that, in the second draft  of  the  Bill,
we've greatly strengthened the national ports  regulator.  In  the  original
draft, the intention was to have a regulator, so long as the National  Ports
Authority was inside of Transnet, so that the relationship between  Transnet
and  the  National  Ports  Authority  inside  of  it  could  effectively  be
regulated by a third party.

However, the more we looked at the  Bill,  the  more  we  had  hearings  and
listened to different stakeholders, the more  we  became  convinced  of  the
importance of having a sector-specific national ports  regulator  with  more
permanence, so that we had an entity, not just the competitions  commission,
which, of course, is important in all of these  areas,  but  something  that
had a competence in the specific and complicated area  of  ports  to  ensure
that there was effective regulation  in  this  area.  We  asked  Icasa,  for
instance, to come in and  give  us  their  experience  in  the  broadcasting
sector, to give  us  a  sense  of  how  a  sector-specific  regulator  might
operate. They did, and we are thankful to them for that.

So, in short, what we have done is that we have  given  the  National  Ports
Authority, in this piece of legislation, real power. We want it to  be  more
than just a landlord, sitting back and taking in rent. We want it to  be  an
active agent, planning, thinking long term, thirty  years  or  twenty  years
forward, about the future of our ports, planning serious investment  in  our
port environment.

These are absolutely  critical  for  any  sustainable  economic  growth  and
development in our country. So we want an  active,  proactive  and  powerful
National Ports Authority, but it's very important,  at  the  same  time,  to
make sure that it's regulated power. Therefore, we  substantially  built  up
the  sections  in  the  original  Bill  dealing  with  the  national   ports
regulator.

Those are, basically, the challenges which we think we'll meet. We are  glad
that the Minister feels that this is a good piece of  legislation.  I  think
we also feel, in the committee, that after a long and sometimes  complicated
process, we have produced a good piece of legislation.

In conclusion, I'd like to thank  Dumisani  Ntuli  and  his  team  from  the
national Department of Transport, who were very patient  with  us  and  very
competent in the drafting and redrafting that  happened  in  the  course  of
trying to give effect to the National Ports Authority Bill. Also,  I'd  like
to thank colleagues from the Department  of  Public  Enterprises,  who  were
also present throughout, and the teams from Transnet and the National  Ports
Authority, whom we invited into the process and who helped us a  great  deal
with their particular competency.

We'd also like to say a special word of  thanks  to  the  parliamentary  law
adviser, Herman Smuts, who was very patient with us and  helped  us  a  lot.
Also, we thank all those who  made  submissions  -  the  trade  unions,  the
fishing industry, the National Port User Forum and the oil  industry.  There
was a huge range of people. Many of them came back twice because  we  had  a
first draft and then a second draft, for  which  they  came  back  a  second
time. So, to all of those  who  made  submissions,  we  hope  we  have  done
justice to their submissions.

Finally, then, a word of thanks also goes to Minister Dullah Omar  and  also
to his counterpart, Minister Jeff Radebe,  the  two  Ministers  who  have  a
direct  interest  in  this  piece  of  legislation.  They  were   supportive
throughout. We'd like to thank them.

The ANC supports the National Ports Authority Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S B FARROW: Madam Speaker, the Bill before us has been nearly  two  years
in the making. The National Ports Authority Bill was thoroughly  scrutinised
through public hearings at both the White Paper  stages  and  in  the  final
product that we have now laid before the House.

Despite the fact that the White Paper did not come  back  to  the  portfolio
committee for consensus prior to us commencing work on the Bill, I must  say
that I can  only  compliment  our  portfolio  Chair  for  his  thorough  and
participatory approach in ensuring that all stakeholders had their say.

The Bill now paves the way for greater participation by the  private  sector
in order to enable our ports to become more efficient,  while  at  the  same
time  acting  as  a  catalyst  for  increased  and  competitive  trade  both
regionally and internationally.

Ports are crucial nodal points in the transport  system  and  play  a  major
role in the economic  growth  and  development  of  our  country.  For  this
reason, it is paramount that our ports, as part  of  the  transport  sector,
continue to operate as key contributors to  South  Africa's  competitiveness
globally.

At present our harbours are congested; they lack certain key  equipment  and
infrastructure, and suffer from various levels of inefficiencies.  This  has
been brought about, to a large degree, by unprecedented  increase  in  trade
since our entry into the global markets. I brought these issues up  on  many
occasions in this House and in the media, and  during  the  public  hearings
many of these same concerns were expressed.

We  must  accept  that  there  is  a  problem  with  South   African   ports
infrastructure. While the sad state of our ports  is  of  national  concern,
the primary blame lies at the door of the Department of Public  Enterprises.
I must also concede that the shipping lines are not  free  from  blame.  Bad
planning,   overbooking   and   shortages   of   containers   and   manifest
discrepancies  also  play  a  role  in  the  congestion  and  delays   being
experienced.

These delays resulted in shipping companies slapping a US$100  surcharge  on
every container in all our ports in February this year.  And  although  this
surcharge has now been confined to Durban only, it had  a  major  impact  on
the image of potential overseas investors and  the  competitiveness  of  our
exporters, whilst importers simply pass on the costs to us, the consumers.

During April of 2002 the Portfolio Committee on Transport went  on  a  fact-
finding mission to Durban, City Deep and Pretcorn container  terminals,  and
identified a number of constraints, as well as providing some  solutions  to
the crisis.  Much  of  the  problems  related  to  lack  of  equipment,  co-
ordination and  the  streamlining  of  the  supply  chain  towards  a  fully
integrated seamless transport system.

In a written question to  the  Minister  of  Public  Enterprises  about  the
crisis, he listed insufficient spending  on  equipment,  lack  of  training,
broken equipment for unloading, poor co-ordination between harbour and  rail
authorities, poor labour relations  and  many  more  as  reasons  for  these
delays. That was over 18 months ago. Yet despite  various  interventions  to
acquire equipment the problem is not satisfactorily addressed.

New equipment procurement takes time to  build  and  install,  and  existing
equipment  is  under  severe  strain  through  lack  of  maintenance.   More
importantly, productivity needs  to  be  dramatically  improved.  We  cannot
continue to off-load containers at almost half the international  norm.  The
transport Seta needs to become  involved  in  intensive  training  with  our
crane drivers to improve productivity, whilst  at  the  same  time  ensuring
that routine maintenance prevents  downtime  by  having  adequately  trained
maintenance personnel available at all times.

Hopefully,  this  Bill  will  bring  new  meaning   and   urgency   to   the
concessioning at some of our ports and I look forward  to  announcements  in
this regard in the not-too-distant future,  particularly  the  Minister  for
Public  Enterprises's  commitment  to  fast-tracking  the  Durban  container
facility.

The White Paper is clear in this regard and contracts linked  to  lease  and
concession agreements will constitute the two main instruments to  give  the
private sector operators a larger role  in  the  operations  of  our  ports,
while on the other hand terminal infrastructure and cargo handling could  be
privately provided and managed by  concessions,  leases  and  licences,  all
contained in the Bill.

I'm aware of  the  implications  of  taking  away  one  of  Transnet's  most
important cash cows overnight. However, the Bill does  allow  for  a  three-
phased approach  towards  National  Ports  Authority's  incorporation.  This
process is planned to be completed within three years of enactment  of  this
Bill. A lot of work lies ahead.

Finally, let me just mention some salient factors with regard to  two  other
important aspects of the Bill. The first relates to the establishment of  an
independent ports regulatory body. The White Paper  puts  its  role  clearly
into perspective: Ports regulation needs to distinguish  between  technical,
environmental and social oversight on the one hand, and  economic  oversight
on the other. It gives the following basic guiding principles: avoidance  of
regulation where the market can freely operate  and  the  playing  field  is
level,  without  regulatory  intervention,  and  formal  separation  of  the
responsibilities for economic regulation from  port  management  operations.
I'm pleased to note that this aspect is now being  adequately  addressed  in
the Bill as initial drafts were too restrictive, as I understood  them,  and
bordered on interference in the management and operations of our ports.

The whole aspect of the permanence of  the  regulator  still  needs  further
debate, and the DA sincerely believes  that  its  role  will  need  constant
oversight and monitoring. One questions  whether  the  regulator  will  only
create another layer of bureaucracy and incur the cost  for  Government  and
ports users when much of its function or anticompetitive behaviour could  be
handled by existing structures  of  the  Competition  Commission.  The  real
independence  of  the  regulator  reporting  directly  to  the  Minister  of
Transport also needs oversight and monitoring.

Last but not least, let me talk about the landlord  functions  of  the  NPA.
From something which started  off  as  a  highly  controversial  chapter  on
Maydon Wharf, it is now far more embracing  and  acceptable.  The  DA  fully
supports  the  need  for  the  NPA  to   renegotiate   old   apartheid   and
discriminatory long-term leases on immovable properties  and  to  make  them
more market-orientated, as outlined in clause 67. In every  case  where  the
NPA and the lessee are unable to reach  an  agreement,  section  25  of  the
Constitution will apply.

Madam Speaker, I'm confident that we can make this Bill work, and  with  the
recent appointment of Ms Maria Ramos at the helm  of  the  Transnet  vessel,
I'm sure she will transform our ports into something we will be  very  proud
of. And hopefully, the amount of R1,5 billion ... Is that right, Chair?  ...
will also be brought into the mix in trying to solve  minor  inefficiencies.
The DA will be supporting this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Madam Speaker, the Bill before the House is the product  of
a White Paper on National  Commercial  Policy  published  last  year,  which
identifies  South  Africa's  major  ports  as  strategic  entities  in   the
transport system. They were to be globally competitive, safe and  secure  in
order to operate at internationally accepted  levels  and  ensure  that  the
objectives of the Reconstruction and Development  Programme  and  Gear  were
met.

These ports are identified as the largest, best equipped and most  efficient
on the continent of Africa and therefore need to be  managed  in  accordance
with clear guidelines and internationally approved norms and standards.  The
Chairman of the Portfolio Committee on Transport has just  mentioned  a  few
of these ports, Durban, Richard's Bay, Mossel Bay, etc.

The overall objective of the Bill is to create an institutional  arrangement
to bring about an effective governance of  ports  in  the  country,  and  to
ensure the establishment and operation of a  National  Ports  Authority  and
the regulator. By so  doing,  the  Bill  seeks  to  improve  management  and
efficient operations of ports.

Ports, as exit and entry points by sea in and out of the  country,  are  the
face and mirror that depict the real situation obtaining in  a  country.  It
is through the ports that technology  and  economic  development  reach  the
hinterland from our shores. Within this context the  IFP  will  support  the
Bill and watch the situation closely to see whether the objectives  of  Gear
are adhered to as best they can.

The National Ports Authority currently works as a division of  Transnet  and
the  Bill  determines  that  such  National  Ports  Authority  continues  to
function until the proposed Act  comes  into  operation  on  a  date  to  be
determined by the Minister. The authority to  be  so  established  shall  be
known as the National Ports Authority Proprietary  Limited.  Transnet  shall
be the sole member and shareholder in the new company. Since Transnet  is  a
state-owned enterprise, the Minister for Public Enterprises shall  therefore
be the shareholding Minister in the new company.

In order that the new company ensures efficient  and  economic  functioning,
the Bill determines various tasks as of paramount importance,  such  as  the
development and improvement of port infrastructure, the control and  use  of
land within the ports to  ensure  increased  participation  of  historically
disadvantaged persons in ports operations, etc.

It is also important to note that with all these  changes,  all  persons  in
the employ of the authority at the time of its  being  changed  into  a  new
company will be transferred  without  loss  of  service  or  benefits.  This
condition is uppermost as workers do in  some  cases  experience  losses  in
different ways when such changes take place, and companies show no mercy  to
the victims of such situations.

Another important development in the Bill is the  establishment  of  a  body
called the ports regulator, whose main task will be to hear  complaints  and
appeals  about  any  abuse  of  power  by  the  National   Ports   Authority
Proprietary Limited and to  ensure  equity  in  accessing  port  facilities,
including  matters  of  tariffs.  The  mandate  of  the  regulator  provides
insurance for the workers and other port users that their  jobs  and  rights
are secure.

As indicated above, the IFP will watch closely as to how far the  notion  of
privatisation is  adhered  to  in  the  day-to-day  operations  of  the  new
company. With its free-market-oriented  policy,  the  IFP  will  oppose  any
attempt at policy development with a notion to nationalise  assets  as  that
does not stimulate economic growth, but  instead  stifles  the  economy  and
hardens the attitudes of would-be investors.

Petroleum pipelines that cut across the country, across farms and rural  and
traditional areas will have to be negotiated with the people  so  that  they
don't pose any danger to people settlement; and royalties have to be  agreed
upon, especially in traditional areas. I thank you, Madam Speaker.

Mr P M SIBANDE: Madam Speaker,  Ministers,  hon  members  and  distinguished
guests, I will start my speech by reciting a  marvellous  song,  which  goes
thus:


  Ayanqikaza ayesaba amagwala,  athi  kungcono  sihlehlise  ukhetho.  Kodwa
  thina bakaKhongolose  sithi  shona  malanga,  shona  malanga.  Siyodibana
  okhethweni ku-ballot box. Kuyodela uMakhasana uma  sezinikizana.  Kuyothi
  sekuphuma imiphumela yokhetho, asazi ukuthi bonke laba abanemilomo  emide
  eshwizayo, entwebayo, bayobuye bakhale ngani ngoba intando yeningi  iyobe
  seyiyikhethile inkunzi ebhongayo kule ngabadi  yakithi.  Inkunzi  kungaba
  ubani ngaphandle kukaKhongolose?

Nature blessed our country by placing  our  ports  in  strategic  geographic
positions on the South  African  coastline.  The  National  Ports  Authority
which was launched on 23 August 2001 is the landlord  of  commercial  ports.
Its  main  task  is  to  oversee  all  aspects  of   port   management   and
administration. Among the duties that it is required to carry out  are:  the
provision and maintenance of port infrastructure; control of the leasing  of
property for port activity; and the rendering of  marine  services  such  as
navigational safety.

On an international level,  the  NPA's  role  as  port  authority  has  been
recognised in two  significant  ways.  It  was  elected  to  host  the  23rd
International Association of  Ports  and  Harbours  World  Ports  Conference
which took place in Durban earlier this year. It was the first  time  during
the IAPH's 45 years of existence that its conference  was  held  in  Africa.
The  chief  executive  officer,  Mr  Siyabonga  Gama,   was   appointed   as
chairperson of the Port  Management  Association  of  Eastern  and  Southern
Africa. It is also a first time in the 26 years of existence of  the  PMAESA
that the chairpersonship of the association  is  afforded  to  the  southern
region. This international accolade is a recognition of the  important  role
that our ports play in promoting regional economic development.

Our national ports, together with other ports in Southern  Africa,  play  an
important role in the economies of the neighbouring, landlocked  members  of
SADC and provide a vital link in the  logistic  chain  that  binds  Southern
Africa. Our National Ports Authority believes in fostering co-operation  and
support between other African countries in  pursuit  of  the  objectives  of
Nepad and the African Renaissance.

At the beginning of this year, the  NPA  concluded  an  agreement  with  the
Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority in order to boost regional trade. The co-
operation agreement also means  that  the  two  port  authorities  will  put
forward similar viewpoints at international conferences to promote a  common
vision for ports in the region.

The NPA has also been very active in terms of its  own  transformation.  Ten
years ago, the board of the NPA was entirely made up  of  white  men.  Since
then, the authority has made great strides in  terms  of  addressing  gender
and race imbalances among its employees. Ports serve as  vital  elements  of
our economic prosperity. The  ports  of  South  Africa  are  the  uterus  of
national  commerce.  The  economy's  health  is  more  dependent  on   water
transportation of  goods  than  on  any  other  single  form  of  commercial
traffic. Annually, about 98% of  our  country's  international  trade  flows
into and out of our country via its ports. It also has a  multiplier  effect
on the economy of the region.

The ANC's vision for our national ports is that  our  ports  should  support
the goals and objectives of the RDP, Gear and Nepad.  In  order  to  deliver
its vision, we need, amongst others things, to increase  our  investment  in
ports infrastructure; improve safety and security  and  the  reliability  of
ports operations; and promote good employment practices. In a  nutshell,  it
means that we will have to modernise the management  and  operation  of  our
national ports to enable them to cope better  with  the  rapid  increase  of
goods flowing in and out of the country  due  to  South  Africa's  increased
growth rate. Our country's economic success makes  it  essential  to  expand
critical ports infrastructure and strengthen the regulation  and  management
of our national ports.

Our ports are on the brink of a new  era  which  will  be  heralded  by  the
adoption, today, of the National Ports Authority Bill that is  supported  by
the ANC. The Bill seeks to address the problems  and  challenges  that  face
the South African ports. It represents a common vision of the role that  our
commercial ports can and must  play  in  meeting  the  basic  needs  of  our
people, developing our human resources, and in building the economy.

One of the  biggest  challenges  that  face  our  ports  is  the  growth  of
containerised cargo. At the beginning of this year there were some  concerns
over container congestion at the Durban and Cape Town  container  terminals.
While opposition  parties  were  quick  to  jump  on  this  as  evidence  of
incompetence in these ports, the backlogs were really  caused  by  shipments
that were unusually large in volume, which contributed to  the  build-up  of
ships waiting outside the ports. What these opposition  parties  omitted  to
say was that the Durban  container  terminal  handled,  on  average,  3  149
containers during the congested period. It also set a  new  daily  container
handling record of 4 465, which is the equivalent of 1,6 million  containers
a year and is 50% above the design capacity of the terminal.

Each of the seven major ports plays an important role in making our  country
an attractive investment destination. The port  of  Durban  is  the  busiest
port  in  Southern  Africa  and  handles  about  5  000  commercial  vessels
annually, and brings in 31,4 million tons of cargo  worth  R50  000  billion
per year - which represents  65%  of  the  total  revenue  earned  by  South
African ports.

The port of Cape Town, in turn, is strategically placed  on  the  world  sea
routes and is ideally situated to serve as a  harbour  for  cargoes  between
Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania.  The  port  of  East  London
boasts of having the largest export grain elevator in South Africa  and  has
recently been converted to handle imports in addition to  exports.  It  also
has a car terminal which has one of the fastest times  for  moving  imported
units from ships to their final points. Forward ever, backwards  never!  The
ANC supports the Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr J J NIEMANN: Mevrou die Speaker, weens  omstandighede  buite  my  beheer
het ek baie min van die Portefeuljekomitee oor  Vervoer  se  besprekings  en
belanghebbendes se  voorleggings  oor  die  National  Ports  Authority  Bill
bygewoon, maar tydens dié wat ek wel bygewoon het, was ek besonder  beïndruk
deur die baie deeglike voorleggings en besprekings, asook  die  debatvoering
wat plaasgevind het, sodat ek vandag kan sê ek is oortuig dat  dit  'n  baie
goeie, deurtrapte wetsontwerp is  wat  ons  aan  die  Raad  vir  goedkeuring
voorlê. Dus is dit ook vir my aangenaam om te kan aankondig dat die Nuwe  NP
die wetsontwerp aanvaar en dit beslis in alle opsigte sal steun.

Vir 'n land soos Suid-Afrika is daar drie baie belangrike  komponente  nodig
om 'n suksesvolle land te word. Eerstens moet die land oor 'n baie  deeglike
en moderne spoorwegstelsel  beskik  wat  aanhoudend  opgegradeer  moet  word
sodat die landbou-, die mynbou- en die baie ander uitvoerprodukte vinnig  na
die hawens vervoer kan word.

Tweedens moet daar ook 'n padnetwerk wees wat om  dieselfde  redes  produkte
van watter aard ook al spoedig en veilig by die hawens kan lewer. Om dit  te
bereik moet daar deurlopende, basiese instandhouding en opgradering van  ons
padnetwerk wees. In albei genoemde gevalle gaan daar in  die  volgende  paar
jaar enorme bedrae geld bestee word. Die eindpunt is die hawens. Die  hawens
sit ook met enorme probleme om die steeds toenemende vrag  in-  en  uitvoere
te hanteer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J J NIEMANN: Madam Speaker, due to circumstances beyond  my  control,  I
attended very few of the Portfolio Committee on Transport's discussions  and
interested parties' submissions on the National Ports  Authority  Bill,  but
during those that I did in fact attend, I was particularly impressed by  the
very thorough submissions and discussions as well as the  level  of  debate,
that I can say today  that  I  am  convinced  that  this  is  a  very  well-
scrutinised Bill we are bringing  before  the  House  for  approval.  It  is
therefore a pleasure to announce that the New  National  Party  accepts  the
Bill and will support it in all respects.

For a country like South Africa to become a successful country,  three  very
important components are needed. Firstly, the country must have  a  thorough
and modern railway system which must be upgraded  constantly  in  order  for
agriculture, mining and the many other export  products  to  be  transported
speedily to the ports.

Secondly, there must also be a road network  that,  for  the  same  reasons,
must deliver products of any kind  quickly  and  safely  to  the  ports.  To
achieve this, there must be continuous, basic maintenance and  upgrading  of
our road network. In both of the cases  mentioned  considerable  amounts  of
money is going to be spent over the next few years.  The  final  destination
is the ports. The ports are also faced with  enormous  problems  in  dealing
with the ever-increasing load of imports and exports.]
The upgrading and modernisation of our harbours are at least 10 to 15  years
overdue. The main purpose of the National Ports Authority Bill is to  ensure
that ports  in  our  country  comply  with  the  modern  demands  by  making
provision for efficient, safe and affordable port services.

Furthermore, in the first instance, the Bill seeks to  create  a  legal  and
institutional framework  conducive  to  the  regulation  and  management  of
ports. Secondly, it provides for the establishment  of  the  National  Ports
Authority as a  stand-alone  entity  outside  Transnet.  Thirdly,  the  Bill
provides for the creation of an independent ports regulator  whose  function
will be, in the first instance, to  oversee  the  relationship  between  the
authority and Transnet whilst it is still part  of  Transnet;  and,  in  the
second instance, ensure that South African ports remain competitive.

En om kompeterend te wees in die vinnig veranderende wêreld sal ons in Suid-
Afrika 'n nuwe kultuur van werketiek moet skep, anders sal ons nié  met  die
res van die moderne wêreld kan kompeteer nie. Ek dank  u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[And to  be  competitive  in  the  fast-changing  world,  we  will  have  to
establish a new culture of work ethic in South Africa, or  we  will  not  be
able  to  compete  with  the  rest  of  the  modern  world.  I  thank   you.
[Interjections.]]

Ms  C  DUDLEY:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  the  ACDP   supports   this
legislation which allows the ports authority to become the landowner of  the
ports. This, in turn, allows for the  franchising  of  port  facilities  and
opens the door for full-blown commercialisation and privatisation.  This  is
a positive move, with the promise  of  more  efficient  and  effective  port
services.

The necessary safeguards, however, must ensure that we do  not  simply  move
from a state monopoly to a private monopoly. As our  market  is  not  strong
enough, it is essential that the ports become a  strong,  all-user  facility
so as not to reduce competition and risk shutting out  shipping  lines.  Any
practice which discourages shipping lines would be to the detriment  of  the
ports and South Africa as a whole.

The difference, for example, between London and Cape Town,  is  that  London
has nine port authorities while Cape Town has one. That  makes  an  all-user
facility imperative. Any move towards  privatisation  and  commercialisation
will, of course, bring  with  it  concerns  that  workers'  rights  will  be
prejudiced. This  perception,  however,  is  unfortunate  as  efficient  and
effective ports will improve and generate  new  business,  and  create  more
opportunities  for  workers   in   general.   Congested,   ineffective   and
inefficient ports strike  at  the  heart  of  the  economy  and,  therefore,
negatively impact on all South Africans.

However, in the Bill it appears that two of the most important  bodies  were
not consulted in this process, namely, the  Association  of  Shipping  Lines
and the SA Association of Freight Forwarders. Hon Minister, if this  is  so,
was there a reason for that?
Finally, the ACDP notes that this Bill follows the present trend  of  hybrid
legislation.  Empowerment  issues  should  be  dealt  with  in   empowerment
legislation and not unnecessarily adorn  all  other  legislation.  The  ACDP
welcomes this Bill and will vote in favour of it. I thank you.

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Speaker, the UCDP supports this Bill. The  process  was
a lengthy one, since an interdepartmental task team and  steering  committee
was set up. Transnet and all its divisions were also actively involved.  The
National Ports Authority Bill aims to promote the policy goals of the  White
Paper by providing for the establishment of two  key  institutions,  namely,
the National Ports Authority and the ports regulator.

The seven commercial ports in South Africa  -  Richards  Bay,  Durban,  East
London, Port Elizabeth, Mossel Bay, Cape Town and Saldanha Bay  -  are  some
of the largest, best-equipped and most efficient  ports  on  the  continent.
Due to their important role in the import and export  of  goods  within  the
subcontinent, it is vital that commercial ports are  managed  in  accordance
with clear guidelines and principles.

The Bill's aim focuses on the establishment and operation  of  the  National
Ports Authority and the ports regulator. It also deals with other  regulated
matters aimed at improving  the  management  and  operation  of  ports.  The
National Ports Authority of South  Africa  is  already  in  existence  as  a
division of  Transnet.  Therefore  the  Bill  determines  that  the  present
National Ports Authority must continue to function as  the  authority  until
the proposed Act comes into effect.

The ports regulator will consist of a chairperson and, at most,  four  other
members who will be appointed by the Minister of Transport for a period  not
exceeding five years, and may be reappointed. The Minister of  Transport  is
also responsible for appointing a chief  executive  officer  for  the  ports
regulator, who in turn may appoint the employees necessary to carry out  the
duties of the regulator.

The Bill requires the  shareholding  Minister,  that  is  the  Minister  for
Public Enterprises, to take the necessary steps  to  convert  the  authority
into a public company on the date of the  authority's  conversion  into  the
National Ports Authority (Pty) Ltd. The  state,  through  Transnet,  becomes
the only member and shareholder of the authority.

The main function of the National Ports Authority (Pty) Ltd will be to  own,
manage, control and administer ports in such a manner that will ensure  that
there is efficient and economic functioning.  The  Bill  determines  various
tasks to be conducted by authorities, such as to develop  and  improve  port
infrastructure and to control land use within ports,  for  example,  through
the licensing of activities.

With South Africa's seven  commercial  ports  amongst  the  sixteen  biggest
ports in Southern Africa, the National Ports Authority is the  largest  port
authority in the region. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, it is noted  that  national  ports  play  an
important and vital role  in  the  economic  growth  of  South  Africa.  The
extension  of  their  activity  from  entrance  and  exit  points  to  major
industrial and logistic focal points is profitable.

With the state of our economy and  the  challenge  of  poverty,  the  MF  is
supportive of all sectors beneficial  to  the  betterment  of  our  economy.
Noting the economic benefits which our national  ports  contribute,  the  MF
supports the provisions of the National Ports Authority Bill that allow  for
the establishment of a National  Ports  Authority  that  will  own,  manage,
control and administer ports on behalf of the state.

Concern is extended, though, as to  the  checks  and  balances  involved  in
this. With corruption as  a  weakness,  the  MF  seeks  the  maintenance  of
monitoring to ensure efficient and effective management of this  authority's
strict adherence to the role it is adopting. However, the  MF  is  confident
that the board will represent an efficient membership that will manage  this
adequately and sufficiently. Concern is also extended regarding the  process
of transferring staff from the Transnet National  Ports  Authority  to  this
authority. It is hoped that this process will not have a negative effect  on
employment.

Provision made for our disadvantaged groups is encouraging  though.  The  MF
has no objections to the transfer  of  ports,  land  and  other  rights  and
obligations to this authority, as long as it is conducted in the most  cost-
effective manner.

The MF is confident that the establishment  of  this  authority  will  prove
beneficial to our economy and supports  this  Bill.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause]

Mrs N D MBOMBO: Madam Speaker ...

An HON MEMBER: Malibongwe! [Let it be praised!]

Mrs N D  MBOMBO:  Igama  lamakhosikazi!  [The  name  of  women!]  Hon  Madam
Speaker, Ministers, comrades and the House  at  large,  the  purpose  of  my
contribution today is to look at the issue of fisheries in  the  context  of
the restructuring of our country's national ports.

The South African industry has a vested interest  in  the  ports  throughout
South  Africa,  and  has  made  significant  investments  in  upgrading  and
maintaining property leased by them in ports. In making submissions  at  our
hearings, their primary concern related to  the  clauses  which  provide  an
outline for intervention by the National Ports Authority in existing  leases
or licences in ports. There  are  three  grounds  upon  which  the  NPA  can
intervene in existing  leases  or  licences.  In  terms  of  the  Bill,  the
National Ports Authority is empowered to order matters  properly,  and  this
is necessary to improve the safety,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the
port operations.  In  their  view,  these  measures  to  vary  or  terminate
existing lease agreements were not desirable and should have been taken  out
of the Bill entirely.

Iinjongo  eziphambili  zoMthetho-sihlomelo  kukususa   kuTransnet   uxanduva
lweenkqubo  nolawulo  lwamazibuko  ukuze  lugqithiselwe  kwiNational   Ports
Authority,  inkampani  ezimeleyo,   nakubatyalimali,   kwandulwe   kumiselwe
inkampani kawonke-wonke eya kuba phantsi kweliso  loMphathiswa  waMashishini
kaRhulumente. Khange  ibe  ziinjongo  zoMthetho-sihlomelo  ukuchasa  igalelo
elibalulekileyo  lezoqoqosho  elidalwa  lushishino  ngeentlanzi   kumazibuko
akweli, kubandakanywa noqoqosho lweli lizwe ngokubanzi.  Siyazingca  kakhulu
ngokuthi  amashishini  eentlanzi  atyale  imali  ngokuthi  aqeshe   izakhiwo
kumazibuko ethu.

Njengoko sele kucacisiwe, kujoliswe kwimo yaseMuidenhof eThekwini.  Mayicace
gca into  yokuba  lo  Mthetho-sihlomelo  awuzi  kunika  magunya  kwinkampani
yamazibuko   kuzwelonke   ngenjongo   yokutshintsha    okanye    yokuphelisa
isivumelwano  sokuqesha  izakhiwo  nakanjani   na.   IKomiti   yasePalamente
ejongene  nalo  mba  izazi  kakuhle  iziphumo   zokudungadunga   imvisiswano
ephakathi kwabasebenzi bamazibuko nabaphathi  bawo.  Siyazi  saye  silindele
ukuba ezi zivumelwano zingafane ziphazanyiswe nanjani na  ngaphandle  kokuba
imo igunyazise oko.
Noxa sivuma ukuba  kufanele  sibe  nenkathalo  mayela  noqeshiso  lwezakhiwo
kwanezinye izixhobo ezihambisana noko ngakumbi  xa  inkampani  kawonke-wonke
yamazibuko ineenjongo ezimdaka xa  ifuna  ukuhlaziya  izigqibo.  Ayizonjongo
zoMthetho-sihlomelo ukuhlaziya isigqibo  ngasinye,  ngakumbi  ezo  zandulela
ukutyikitywa kwamagatya anxululmene nocalu-calulo. (Translation of  isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[The main objective of this Bill  is  the  transfer  from  Transnet  to  the
National  Ports  Authority,  an  independent   company,   and   shareholders
management of port operations, and the  subsequent  formation  of  a  public
company under the leadership of the Minister of Public Enterprises.  It  has
never been the intention of this Bill  to  nullify  the  important  economic
contribution of fisheries to this country's harbours, including the  economy
of this country. We are very proud of the fact that fisheries have  invested
money by leasing buildings in our harbours.

As has been explained earlier, this is directed at Maydon Wharf  in  Durban.
The point must be made that this Bill doesn't  grant  unfettered  powers  to
the National Ports Authority to change or annul lease  agreements  at  will.
The portfolio committee is fully  aware  of  what  happens  when  agreements
between port staff and port managers are  tampered  with.  We  expect  these
agreements not to be tampered with unless the situation warrants it.

We agree that we should be careful  around  the  issue  of  the  leasing  of
buildings and related equipment, particularly  in  cases  where  the  public
company shows some ulterior motives when renewing contracts. It is  not  the
intention of the Bill to renew every contract, particularly those that  were
entered into prior to the signing of clauses related to discrimination.]

Some long-term leases, particularly those that were concluded  a  long  time
ago, contain discriminatory clauses. A simple example would be leases  which
contain clauses that prohibit a lessee from  subletting  immovable  property
to people that were excluded from occupying property in a  certain  area  in
terms of the Group Areas Act.

Masingacimeli sivale amehlo ngathi yonke  into  ilungile,  kube  kusonakala.
Siphethe ikrele ngoku, uMgaqo-siseko wenkululeko  osivule  amehlo.  Sizibona
ngo`see,' ngawo omabini izenzo ezigwenxa nobuqhophololo.

Ndihlaba ikhwelo kumakhosikazi malunga namathuba aza kuvezwa ngulo  mthetho,
lokuba  indima  yawo  ibonakale,  angabi  ngabaqeshwa   bokwenza   umsebenzi
ophantsi  koko  babe  ngabaqeshi.  Makhosikazi!  (Translation  of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Let us not bury our heads in the sand and pretend that everything  is  okay
when it  is  not.  We  now  have  the  weapon  in  our  hand,  a  democratic
Constitution, which has opened our eyes to a  number  of  opportunities.  We
see with both eyes any unbecoming and corrupt practices.

I appeal to women regarding the  opportunities  that  will  flow  from  this
Bill, that they should play  a  visible  role,  and  that  they  should  not
content themselves with the menial jobs, but be employers. Women!]

We cannot run away from the fact that there may be instances where  a  lease
agreement has been concluded to use a port for a  particular  activity,  but
the port has since been used for absolutely unrelated  activities,  nor  can
we allow a situation in which immovable property that  is  a  subject  of  a
lease agreement should continue to be used even when it is clear  that  such
use does not contribute towards the  efficient  and  effective  use  of  the
port.

Our ports are a national asset which plays an important social and  economic
role. Our National Ports Authority needs,  therefore,  to  be  empowered  to
look at those leases and to see how it can best deal  with  such  leases  to
ensure  that  they  contribute  towards  government,  social  and   economic
development. However, the Bill is not intended  to  be  a  sledgehammer  for
transformation of the fishing industry. There are other  interventions  that
are specifically designed to deal with these aspects,  such  as  the  Broad-
based Black Economic Empowerment Bill and fishing quotas.

Ngaloo magama ke sithi makhosikazi  vukani.  Sibulela  kakhulu  kuMphathiswa
uDullah Omar - akakho ngoku.  O-o,  bendingakuboni  Tata.  Sibulela  kakhulu
nakuwe qabane  uJeremy,  nakuwo  onke  amaqabane  ekomiti  yezothutho  anike
ingxelo apha. Sibulela nakwabasincedisayo, uNozipho neqela lakhe,  nakubonke
abanye   abakhoyo   apha.   Somlomo,   ngaloo   mazwi    ndithi,    Phambili
ngamakhosikazi! [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[With those words we say: Women, stand up and be counted. Special thanks  go
to Minister Dullah Omar - he is not here. Oh!, I didn't  see  you,  sir.  We
thank you too, Comrade  Jeremy,  and  all  the  comrades  in  the  transport
committee who made contributions here. We also thank the staff, Nozipho  and
her group, and everybody else present here.  Speaker,  with  those  words  I
say: "Forward with women!" [Applause.]]
The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Firstly,  I  apologise
to hon Mbombo for moving from my seat  and  making  it  a  little  bit  more
difficult for her to see me.

I want to thank all the hon members who  participated  in  this  debate  and
discussion. It is quite clear that the work which was done in the  portfolio
committee has had very positive results. I was a bit  disappointed  in  only
one aspect of what hon Farrow said. He was wondering whether it was  correct
that the port regulator should be reporting to the Minister,  on  the  basis
that that undermines or potentially undermines the independence of the  port
regulator.

I obviously do not agree with him. The port regulator has to report to  some
authority. The current  situation  is  that  everything  resides  in  Public
Enterprises. So we are now  going  to  have  a  situation  where  the  ports
operations  will  be  carried  on  through  Public  Enterprises,   but   the
regulation will no longer be done through that department.
Naturally, we will respect the independence of the port  regulator  and  the
port regulator will report to the Minister of Transport. I should point  out
that in the case of the SA Maritime Safety  Authority,  the  Civil  Aviation
Authority,  Air  Traffic  Navigation  Services  and  the  new  Rail   Safety
Authority, all of them report to the Minister of  Transport.  Not  a  single
one of them has had any problem with regard to their independence.

Hon Dudley asked a question. I'm not  quite  sure  whether  my  answer  will
cover  the  question  that  she  asked.  My  impression  is  that  the   two
organisations that she mentioned  were  represented  on  the  National  Port
Users Forum and that they  participated  through  that  forum.  I  hope  I'm
correct in that regard, but that is the instruction  that  I  got.  If  they
were not consulted, there was no intention of  excluding  them  at  all.  Of
course, there is going to be consultative committees which will  be  set  up
under the Act, and there will be adequate opportunities for consultation.  I
am personally very keen that those consultative processes should proceed  as
quickly as possible.
Lastly, I just want to agree with all hon members, those who have  commented
on this, that the Bill makes good provisions for institutional  arrangements
and these have been satisfactorily dealt with.  However,  there  is  also  a
great deal of work that lies ahead.

I want to indicate that we have looked at each mode specifically,  but  also
each mode in relation to others because we must move towards  an  integrated
transport system. That is the reason I agree with  hon  Niemann  that  rail,
road and harbour are important.

Ek wil net die een byvoeg  wat  u  gemis  het,  en  dit  is  ons  lughawens.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek weet, u het net vir  'n  oomblik  daarvan  vergeet.  [I
just want to add the one that you have missed, and  that  is  our  airports.
[Interjections.] I know, you just forgot about it for the moment.]

Of course, pipelines were mentioned and they are a Transport  issue.  Again,
we need to look at all of them. What we are  doing  at  national  Government
level is to look at the logistics system so  as  to  ensure  that  there  is
seamless movement of goods and people  through  different  transport  nodes,
and from transport nodes to  a  point  of  consumption.  So  these  are  all
matters that are receiving attention and I  have  no  doubt  that  we'll  be
reporting back to Parliament in due course. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                        EDUCATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker and  hon  members,  I  would
like to begin by thanking the House for agreeing  to  the  Higher  Education
Amendment Bill, on which there will be no debate. This will, for  the  first
time, bring about higher education opportunities in a planned  and  rational
way to the people of Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape,  as  the  legislation
establishes  national  higher  education  institutes  in   each   of   these
provinces.

The Education Laws Amendment Bill has not had such an easy passage.  I  want
to address those members who may oppose  the  proposed  legislation,  in  an
attempt to get them to review their positions. Typically, the amending  Bill
covers a range of matters in different pieces of legislation, and some  have
received more prominence than others. Some of these have been  described  as
protecting  quality  education.  In  fact,  they  have   been   more   about
consolidating existing class differences in public education,  with  a  view
to limiting the distribution of knowledge.

With knowledge, the most valuable asset in  society,  the  wish  to  provide
only a few with opportunities to gain an early advantage  through  schooling
is very strong, but that is not compatible with a  public  education  system
premised on the constitutional values of justice,  equity  and  dignity  for
all.

Before I deal with the more contentious aspects, let me remind you  of  some
of the  other  important  elements  of  the  Bill,  provisions  you  may  be
rejecting. A particular provision is the change of name of the  General  and
Further Education and Training Quality Assurance  Council,  otherwise  known
by the most cumbersome title I've encountered, GENFETQA.

I'm sure you must agree that the name of Umalusi  is  a  great  improvement,
and not just for the sound of it. Umalusi,  which  means  ``the  shepherd'',
symbolises  the  important  function  of  the  council  in  protecting   and
preserving standards  among  the  huge  flock  of  education  providers  and
assessment bodies which make up the education system.

One  problem  we  have  faced,  secondly,  in  the  disciplining  of  errant
teachers, is that of inconsistent sentencing.  Findings  and  sentences  are
determined by the presiding officer, who  is  appointed  on  a  case-by-case
basis, and these decisions  are  not  always  consistent.  At  present,  the
person charged has the right to appeal against  both  the  finding  and  the
sentence, but the provincial departments, or their employers,  do  not  have
that right.

We, therefore, propose these amendments,  so  that  findings  and  sentences
that might be out of line with similar charges and sentences in other  cases
can be taken on appeal to  the  Member  of  the  Executive  Council  in  the
province or the Minister. I hope that this measure to amend  the  Employment
of Educators Act is supported.

This leaves but one aspect: the amendment of the South African Schools  Act.
This provision compels school governing bodies to get  prior  approval  from
the provincial department of education to  award  a  teacher  an  additional
amount over and above his or her salary paid by the state. This  is  a  very
curious piece of legislation for  two  reasons;  one  is  that  it's  highly
extraordinary to allow a public servant to receive  financial  favours  over
and above his or her state salary. So, in allowing this to happen,  although
in a  regulated  fashion  through  legislation,  we  will,  undoubtedly,  be
stretching the  international  conventions  about  benefits  in  the  public
service.

We certainly do not allow additional payments to magistrates, to the  police
or nurses. So teachers have a somewhat special  privilege  here.  To  merely
require that this legislation, this special dispensation, be managed  in  an
open and orderly fashion hardly seems unreasonable.

You'll recall the scandalous case of a school principal in  Mpumalanga,  who
received all kinds of extraordinary benefits from the school governing  body
- a motor car, domestic servants and groceries.  This  amendment  will  stop
that kind of abuse.

The second point of curiosity is that  the  legislation  simply  mirrors  an
existing provision  of  the  Employment  of  Educators  Act,  which  already
prohibits teachers from accepting additional remuneration without the  prior
approval of the employer.  In  my  view,  this  is  a  scandalous  provision
because it victimises the teacher, a teacher who  will  be  acting  in  good
faith because he is being provided with additional  payment  by  the  school
governing body.

However, in any employment context, there are  two  parties,  and  while  we
have provisions to penalise teachers who are accepting money  which,  in  my
view, is really victimisation, we have no basis for dealing  with  the  body
which paid them in contravention of the existing law.

So we say that if a governing  body  wishes  to  recompense  a  teacher  for
genuine, additional work  or  effort,  they  should  inform  the  provincial
department of the  matter  and  request  authorisation.  This  is  hardly  a
stripping of the authority of governing bodies, as some have argued,  but  a
genuine attempt  to  build  transparency  and  accountability,  which  other
speakers will refer to, into the working of the system.

I would like  to  draw  members'  attention  to  pages  14  and  15  of  the
explanatory memorandum attached to the Bill, which deals with a recent  case
in the Limpopo province, in which the court  made  it  quite  clear  that  a
financial commitment by a school governing body to a  teacher  would  become
the responsibility of the employer, which is the province, if the  governing
body were subsequently  to  change  its  mind  about  the  decision  on  the
commitment. In other words, given that school governing bodies  are  elected
afresh from time to time, and they are doing it now, this is one  very  good
reason why this amendment is necessary.

We have heard too many stories from parents of how they were  hoodwinked  at
the fee-setting meeting, where a generic item called salaries  was  included
in the budget, without specifying  how  much,  to  whom  and  for  what  the
payments  were  made.  Democratic  decision-making  requires  this  kind  of
information. In fact, it bolsters the parents. It enhances the role  of  the
parents in taking these decisions.

Additional payments for teachers, if contemplated, must be for work that  is
over and above the  normal  requirements  of  the  state  posts  which  they
occupy. No one should be paid extra for just doing their job. There is  also
no need to pay more to reward top performers, as some  have  claimed,  since
we now have a system of performance management in place, which rewards,  for
the first time, good teaching on an objective and equitable basis.

Where a teacher is required to go beyond the call of duty,  as  many  do  in
townships and in the Model C schools, we have  no  principled  objection  to
them being rewarded for  this,  providing  the  parents  agree.  This  might
include additional time spent on  some  activity  such  as  preparation  for
sports day, school plays, choirs or other events.  Extra  work  should  also
include  additional  intellectual  effort,  since  this   is   an   academic
profession, where we should reward people who  think  about  what  they  are
doing and help others to improve. A bonus to a  teacher  who  was  asked  to
lead a team developing cross-curricular themes or materials could also be  a
very valid request for additional payment.

However, we should be quite clear that this is not a money-making  exercise.
Most schools have insufficient funds to do anything, let alone pay  teachers
an additional salary. We cannot allow this  practice  to  further  skew  the
labour market, with teachers more and more resistant  to  teaching  in  poor
schools for want of salary top-ups.

We cannot allow the few qualified maths and science teachers to  be  tempted
from public schools in the townships to those in town because of higher  pay
by the school. We have one public school system with one salary system,  and
any  deviations  from  this  must  be   well-justified,   well-planned   and
authorised.

Let us  remember  that  for  many  years  teachers  have  voluntarily  taken
responsibility for a host of extramural activities, including  sporting  and
cultural activities. Teachers, even today,  spend  many  hours,  often  late
into the night, to do their bit for the school, whatever it may be. They  do
this for the love of the children, the pride of their  profession  and  many
would be contemptuous if offered extra pay.

So I hope governing  bodies  are  not  prompting  a  system  where  anything
outside the classroom becomes overtime and the only motive for hard work  is
a salary top-up. This would be a sad day. In considering requests,  I  would
caution provincial departments to consider the real need for such  payments,
where  they  exist,  and  the  possible  consequences   to   the   equitable
utilisation of teachers.

I see no menace in this Bill. The Council of Education Ministers has  agreed
unanimously that additional  payments  should  be  permitted  under  certain
circumstances. I would even understand those who opposed the Bill  for  this
reason and say to them that I will be monitoring  the  situation,  based  on
provincial reports. If it's being abused, we will amend  it  again.  If  the
provinces can't fulfil their duties, we'll have a look at it again.

To those who oppose it because they  would  like  to  see  the  free  market
operate within our school system, I would remind them of where we have  come
from: an education system  with  huge  differences  and  divisions.  We  are
aiming to create a more equitable  society,  and  we  can  never  do  so  by
providing unequal education.

I should also remind the House that there is a transitional provision so  as
to enable school governing bodies to make appropriate  arrangements  so  the
Act will not come into effect until the middle of next year. This will  give
them sufficient time to make alternative arrangements.

I commend this to you, and I'm sure  you'll  agree  with  the  proposals.  I
implore you to reconsider your stance, those  who  oppose  it,  because  the
vast majority of South African  teachers,  parents,  organisations  and  the
South African public support this. You see, we speak for the  vast  majority
of people in this country,  and  this  is  necessary  in  order  to  have  a
rational school system without penalising real merit, real effort  and  real
activity by those teachers who are contributing so much to  our  school  and
public life. Thank you very much, hon members. [Applause.]

Mr W P DOMAN: Deputy Speaker, the aim  to  regulate  the  extra  payment  of
state teachers by school governing bodies  is  another  effort  by  the  ANC
Government to try to bring equality about by reducing successful  incentives
for quality education, rather than  attending  to  the  complex  and  poorly
supported environment in which teachers work. Instead  of  thanking  parents
for making their money available to  retain  scarce  skilled  teachers,  and
reward hard-working teachers, the Minister is kicking these parents  in  the
teeth and driving good teachers out of public schools.

The devastating effect of clause 2 will be felt in 2005 when it  comes  into
operation. Scarce skilled and  excellent  teachers  will  leave  the  public
school  system  for  private  schools,  for  overseas,  and/or   leave   the
profession altogether. Teachers at struggling schools will move  to  greener
pastures within the public school system, and in the end  the  schools  with
the most vulnerable learners will suffer the most. This is  also  an  attack
on the poor. Yes, all the learners from disadvantaged  backgrounds,  who  in
their thousands entered former Model C schools and Section 21 schools,  will
experience that a better quality education is yet  again  being  taken  away
from them. No wonder one Bongani Sopam of  Khayelitsha  also  complained  in
the submissions to the department, because  at  his  school  they  also  pay
teachers extra for extra work.

It is a fact that many promotion  posts  are  carried  by  school  governing
bodies. Why? Because of a lack of state money  and  the  unfairness  in  the
existing system, for example, where senior teachers in  SGB  positions  have
to start on notch 1 when becoming a state employee.  Governing  bodies  have
also learned that it is simply not possible to  manage  complex  schools  on
the promotion posts provided.  The  Minister  should  rather  address  these
inequalities and ensure that there are enough promotion incentives  than  to
ban the assistance that SGBs are currently providing in this regard.

In the long term our economy is going  to  suffer  as  a  result  of  poorer
quality education. Sport  and  other  cultural  activities  will  suffer  as
teachers become more and more apathetic towards extracurricular  activities.
Even school hostels will suffer. The platteland  is  going  to  be  affected
most  severely,  because  there  is  a  moratorium  on  the  employment   of
noneducator staff and teachers won't be allowed to fill these duties.

Can you believe that this Bill instructs that any unauthorised payment  must
be reclaimed from parents and teachers serving on SGBs? In  the  submissions
it is stated that teacher unions might be advising  their  teachers  not  to
serve on SGBs in the future because of  this  financial  liability.  Parents
will lose interest in serving on SGBs, and will no  longer  be  prepared  to
pay school fees if they cannot decide themselves how they can  apply  it  to
remunerate quality teachers.

It is no use hiding  behind  the  possibility  of  creating  new  SGB  posts
because we all know it is much  cheaper  to  divide  responsibilities  among
existing teachers. In the Western Cape only 900, instead of the necessary  1
900,  this  year  started  their  studies  to  become   teachers.   Everyone
acknowledges that we have a huge  shortage  of  teachers  in  South  Africa,
especially in maths and science. This very  fact,  and  the  fact  that  the
education department has to compete with the  private  sector  and  overseas
opportunities, should have guided the Minister towards embracing  what  SGBs
are doing by paying teachers extra.

With the irresponsible severance packages a few years  ago,  the  Government
stripped the country of hundreds of its best teachers. I predict  that  this
piece of legislation is going to be the final straw that breaks the  camel's
back. Public schools' quality will inevitably be  affected,  but  of  course
the ANC elite  who  can  afford  it  will  send  their  children  and  their
grandchildren to private schools, and  to  the  about  100  schools  in  the
country that will be able to circumvent this legislation.

In practice this clause won't work. School governing bodies must apply  four
months before they finalise their budgets which  normally  happens,  at  the
latest, by November. They will have to apply in  July  at  the  latest,  but
Minister Asmal's own policy lays down that schools must receive their  staff
allocation by the end of September from the provincial department.  How  can
they apply if they don't know how many teachers they are going to have,  and
how the duties will be divided?

Then subsection 3(a) adds insult to injury by demanding  that  full  details
of the payment must accompany an application. How will this be  possible  if
they don't even know what the details will be?  Furthermore,  if  a  vacancy
arises during the year it is not clear whether the SGB can offer  extra  pay
to the new incumbent if it was not approved in the budget,  or  whether  the
SGB must then apply and wait up to three months for a reply  in  which  case
that teacher would have left that school because he or she was not  prepared
to wait that long.

Then subsection 8 requires that any extra payment must be reflected  in  the
school's budget with the specific purpose  to  inform  the  parents  at  the
budget meeting in November of such payments. But when the  Government  deals
with that application in July to September, they don't even know whether  it
will be reflected or what the parents are going to decide.

Finally, there is no time restriction for MECs to deal with  an  appeal  and
the answer we received is that the SGBs will have to go  to  court  if  they
don't get an answer in a reasonable time. No wonder  that  with  legislation
like this a teacher wrote in a letter  to  The  Star  the  other  day,  ``We
experience the education department as our enemy!''.  And  I  see  that  the
Financial Mail has a very nice photo of the Minister: ``System's  failure  -
why Minister Asmal is to blame''.

The DA offered a clear amendment.  Firstly,  leave  the  decision  with  the
SGBs. Secondly, give them stricter guidelines in this Bill.  Thirdly,  force
them to detail disclosure to parents, and enable the  parents  to  make  the
decision. Fourthly,  let  SGBs  report  to  the  education  department  what
parents decided so that they know what is going on. Fifthly,  we  were  even
prepared to say give the department a veto with an  appeal  process  if  the
school is transgressing the rules; and lastly, give legal clarity  that  any
extra payment will be a contract between an SGB and a teacher that does  not
bind the department in any way.

Die DA se amendement, en 'n soortgelyke een van die ACDP, is  egter  verwerp
in een van die swakste komitee optredes wat ek nog in  my  loopbaan  van  14
jaar gesien het. Gaan kyk na die komitee se program -dis  vir  almal  om  te
sien.  Die  ANC  wou  hierdie  wetsontwerp,  plus  nog  een   se   informele
bespreking, plus twee voorleggings, op een oggend tussen nege-uur en  elfuur
afhandel. As ek nie gevra het vir die voorleggings aan die  departement  oor
die konsepwetsontwerp nie, het ons nie hierdie pak eers te siene gekry nie.

Die ANC het geweier dat ons enige publieke  verhoor  het  om  selfs  na  die
enkele hoofrolspelers te  luister.  Die  aanvanklike  konsepwetsontwerp  het
alle ekstra betaling verbied. Die hele proses van  aansoek  doen  is  as  'n
kompromis ingevoer, maar hierdie hele proses  was  nooit  voor  die  publiek
nie. Ons weet nie  eers  wat  die  onderwysdepartemente  in  die  provinsies
daaroor dink nie en of hulle dit kan uitvoer nie.

Die hantering van hierdie wetsontwerp is  'n  skande  vir  die  parlementêre
proses. Een amptenaar se woord is oor alles aanvaar, en  dis  die  amptenaar
wat die wet geskryf het. Hy is magtiger as hierdie Parlement. Die  ANC,  nie
hierdie amptenaar nie, sal die verantwoordelikheid moet dra as  hierdie  wet
in die praktyk gaan misluk.

Ten slotte is ek geskok dat die Nuwe NP die enigste  party  in  die  komitee
was wat saam met die ANC op elke klousule saamgestem het. Verlede  jaar  het
die Nuwe NP nog teen 'n wet gestem wat skoolbeheerliggame se  magte  aantas,
maar hulle het nou nie eers meer die integriteit om by hierdie  beginsel  te
staan nie. Sewe-en-sewentig persent van Die  Burger  se  lesers  het  in  'n
meningsopname hulle  teen  hierdie  wetgewing  oor  beheerliggame  se  magte
uitgespreek. In die Wes-Kaap gaan dit 'n  gevoelige  slag  wees,  veral  vir
hoërskole wat finansieel sukkel. As net die  bruin  ouers  in  die  Wes-Kaap
besef wat die ANC en die Nuwe NP met hierdie wet doen,  dan  sal  hulle  nie
een stem uit daardie gemeenskap volgende jaar kry  nie.  Ek  dank  u  almal.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The DA's amendment, and  a  similar  one  from  the  ACDP,  were  rejected,
however, in one of the most deplorable actions of a committee  that  I  have
ever seen in my career of 14 years. Go and have a look  at  the  committee's
programme - it is clear for all to see. The ANC wanted  to  deal  with  this
Bill, as well as the informal discussion of another  one,  as  well  as  two
submissions in one morning between nine and eleven o' clock. If  I  did  not
request to see the submissions to the department regarding  the  draft  Bill
we would never even have seen this stack.

The ANC refused us any public hearing even to listen to the  few  key  role-
players. The initial draft Bill prohibited all  extra  payment.  The  entire
process of applying was added in a compromise, but this  whole  process  was
never brought before the public. We do not even know  what  the  departments
of education in the provinces think of it, or whether they can put  it  into
practice.

The way this Bill was handled was a disgrace to the  parliamentary  process.
One official's  word  was  accepted  above  everything,  and  that  was  the
official who wrote the Act. He is more powerful than  this  Parliament.  The
ANC, and not this official, will have to bear  the  responsibility  if  this
Act fails in practice.

In conclusion, I am shocked that the New  NP  was  the  only  party  in  the
committee that agreed with the ANC on every clause. Last  year  the  New  NP
still voted against an Act that affected school  governing  bodies'  powers,
but now they do not even have the integrity  to  stand  by  this  principle.
Seventy-seven percent of Die Burger's  readers  expressed  their  opposition
against this legislation regarding governing bodies' powers  in  an  opinion
poll. In the Western Cape this will be a  hard  blow,  especially  for  high
schools that are struggling financially. If only  the  coloured  parents  in
the Western Cape realise what the ANC and New NP are doing  with  this  Act,
then they will not get one vote from that community next year. I  thank  you
all. [Applause.]]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Deputy Speaker, how I wish all the parties  did  go
to the meetings of the portfolio committee  so  that  they  would  not  find
themselves being misled as to what took place there.

We bent over backwards to accommodate the DA, and  we  did  things  we  have
never done before. This is a Bill that  we  are  not  even  supposed  to  be
debating because everything is contained  here.  For  some  reason  the  hon
Doman is telling this House that it was said in  the  committee  that  those
who had a problem must go to court. Go to clause  10;  it  says  the  direct
opposite.

Again, an impression has been created that in this Bill the  ANC  and  other
parties are saying that school governing bodies  should  not  give  teachers
extra funds. You will not find that in this Bill.

I will confine myself to  clause  2  only,  because  all  the  parties  that
attended agreed on all the other clauses. This particular  clause  reads  as
follows: ``Prohibition of payment of ... '', and I  underline  this  here  -
``... unauthorised remuneration, or giving financial benefit or  benefit  in
kind ... ''. Why is this unauthorised?  It  is  unauthorised  in  the  sense
that, as we speak, if a teacher employed by  the  state  receives  an  extra
package without getting approval, that is against the law.

This is nothing new, and the school governing bodies are  at  the  forefront
of employing teachers. We have been told here that this Bill is taking  away
the powers of school governing bodies. What powers? It  is  this  Government
that changed the school committees into school  governing  bodies,  and  for
the first time there is no teacher - I mean state teacher - that can  go  to
any school without going through a school governing body.

A school governing body tells a teacher: ``I'm  employing  you  under  these
terms. I'm going to pay you R20  for  doing  A,  B,  C.''  The  same  school
governing body knows that, according to the Educators'  Employment  Act,  if
this teacher got more it would be against  the  law.  The  school  governing
body, the very structure that employed this teacher and told him or her  the
terms of employment - and it does not pay  this  teacher;  this  teacher  is
paid by the department - representing the department  in  the  school  as  a
school governing body, says: ``Teacher, I'm employing you. I'm going to  pay
you this much for doing A, B, C.'' Suddenly the same school governing  body,
behind the back of the department, goes to the same teacher and says,  ``I'm
going to give you more''.

This Bill is not saying you cannot pay him or her more. All it is saying  is
that if you reach a stage at which, in order for these  kids  to  understand
mathematics better - the one hour we are  giving  them  at  the  school  not
being enough - I want this teacher to give them one more hour and I'm  going
to give him or her R10 for that.

The department says: ``Surely, SGB, as you agreed earlier, if you are  going
to pay him or her R10, why don't you bring this forward so that together  we
know that the terms of employment of this teacher have  changed  and  he  or
she is going to be paid more.''

Again, we are not legislating for exceptions here. You are in a  school  for
years as a school governing  body  and  as  a  principal.  You  know  you're
experienced, and you are saying that in the past five or 10 years, you  have
experienced that you need a teacher  for  rugby;  you  need  a  teacher  for
mathematics; you need a teacher for this or that, and you want to  pay  more
money for that. In so doing, you budget for it and give it to them. That  is
all this is saying.

Why should we allow the teachers to be penalised for getting more,  and  say
to the very structure that employed them,  ``No.  Feel  free.  Give  them,''
because that is where the problem is. Let us not mislead  the  public.  This
Bill does not say that teachers who do worthy work should not  be  paid  for
it. All it says is that the teachers are not allowed  to  get  more  without
consulting their employer. The  public  schools  are  not  private  schools.
[Interjections.] Whatever happens in a school when the chips are  down,  the
buck stops with the department, not the SGB.

All the SGB did ...  [Interjections.]  Let  me  go  again  through  all  the
documentation. We went through it. The question is:  Why  did  we  not  have
public hearings? I can answer that. [Interjections.]  We  went  through  all
the publications, all the submissions - I'm going  to  go  through  some  of
them - to show that if you go to the contentious clause, that is  clause  2,
you will find that all the submissions have been accommodated in this  Bill.
[Interjections.]

I quote  one:  The  school  governing  body  of  Westville  Girls  High  ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Order!

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker,  is  the  hon  member  prepared  to  answer  a
question? [Interjections.]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Not now. Not now, please.

Dr C P MULDER: I need some clarity, so will it  come  at  the  end  of  your
speech; is that what you are saying? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, hon member. The hon member is not prepared  to  take
your question.

Dr C P MULDER: Not at all?

Prof S M  MAYATULA:  Now  I  want  to  quote  the  submissions.  The  school
governing body of Westville Girls High proposed, and I quote:


  It is suggested that in 38 A(1) the phrase ``which approval should not be
  unreasonably withheld'' be inserted after ``without  the  prior  approval
  from the employer''.

Go to the Bill. In subclause 6 this has been done.

The second submission is that of Camps Bay High School, and I quote:
  Finally there are no criteria set for guiding the head  of  education  in
  how to decide when he or she should allow a teacher to be paid  more  and
  when not.

Go to subclause 7 - all those criteria are there.

The school governing body of Stirling High School proposed:


  If the state insists on including 38 A(1) in the Act, then the  governing
  body believes that: ``An application from a school should not  reasonably
  be refused, as the Act then provides for approval to be given.''

As I referred to above, this has been included in the Bill.

The same school governing body goes on to say:


  The Act must then include a section that imposes a responsibility on  the
  education department concerned to respond within a reasonable  period  of
  time, failing which approval becomes automatic.

If you go to subclause 10 of this Bill, it  addresses  that.  What  does  it
say? It says: If the department does not respond within three  months,  this
school governing body has the right to appeal to the MEC. No court.  If  you
read this document, hon Doman, there is no reference to court and  there  is
no official ... because somebody said that. We are talking law. This is  the
Act. This is the Bill saying that in case of  a  problem,  go  to  the  MEC.
[Interjections.]

Let me go to Fedsas. Fedsas says:


  As public servants, educators should as a matter of law and principle  be
  entitled to travel and subsistence and other allowances  on  exactly  the
  same basis as all or any other public servant.

This is a submission. Subclause 5 of the Bill accommodates that exactly.

I've almost covered the whole Bill we are contending  here,  saying  how  we
have responded positively to what they said. The only  part  where  we  said
no, is where they were saying: ``Hands off our school governing bodies.  Let
our  school  governing  bodies  entice  our  teachers  and  give  them  more
packages. Let us use the Educators'  Employment  Act  against  the  teachers
because they have been enticed by the SGB.'' Surely that cannot be  correct?
[Interjections.] It cannot be correct.

It was the school governing body who welcomed these teachers and  gave  them
their  terms  of  employment,  terms  that  are  negotiated  in  the  labour
negotiating chambers. If for whatever reason we say that  the  salaries  and
what have you of these teachers are low, we cannot  negotiate  that  through
the back door of school governing bodies who, on their own, say ``I'm  going
to give you more'', after getting more. We are saying,  and  I  repeat:  The
school governing bodies who want to give deserving teachers  more  have  all
right to do so. [Interjections.]

This is unfortunate, because this is so simple and straightforward.  We  are
all supposed to be embracing it, because we are balancing  things  here.  We
say we are protecting the teacher, who is going to be given  incentives  and
then left  alone.  We  are  saying  that  the  school  governing  body,  the
government structure we have put in place there, must  also  ...  We  cannot
say, ``Pay'', and thereafter say, ``Why did you pay?''.

When we say, ``Do not prohibit,'' we are only saying we are  prohibiting  in
order to create the space for them to come before us, so that  we  can  give
them the necessary authority to do what they have to do. [Applause.]

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Hon Deputy Speaker, let's put  aside  the  administrative
jargon involved in this Bill and deal with  the  politics  behind  it.  This
debate, once more, forces us to reflect on our situation  as  a  country  in
transition. The issues of  policy  formulation,  policy  implementation  and
delivery are central to this debate. Of course all of these are  related  to
the whole question of transformation. The first critical theme we  therefore
have to understand is the nature of our own transformation.

South Africa's process  of  negotiated  revolution  -  because  ours  was  a
negotiated revolution - has had a very specific character. The  first  thing
we have to acknowledge is  that  there  was  no  vanquished  enemy  in  this
negotiated  revolution.  One  of  the  characteristics  of  this  negotiated
revolution was the inheritance of state institutions. Unlike in the  context
of a conquest, we did not have the luxury of wiping out at  will  all  those
institutions which might have been used to discriminate against the rest  of
us, nor did we have the luxury of driving  the  defeated  parties  into  the
sea, so to speak.

Our negotiated revolution inherited very  complex  relationships  and  state
institutions from the past, including Model C  schools.  These  institutions
are sometimes viewed by transformers with a certain degree of  mistrust.  We
should, therefore, not underestimate the importance  of  building  trust  in
these institutions.

Transformation by definition is a long  and  painful  process,  and  if  not
managed properly, it may lead to very serious  instances  of  decay  in  our
education institutions. Already we are witnessing signs of  education  decay
in various forms: high levels of indiscipline in our schools -  that's  what
we have; low morale among our teachers; lack of accountability at  different
levels of our system; and  unwillingness  of  some  teachers  to  engage  in
extracurricular activities.

In the midst  of  all  this  political  decay,  I  want  to  argue  for  the
encouragement of private initiatives from whatever quarter these  may  come,
including initiatives from school governing bodies, such as the  topping  up
of salaries of state-employed teachers. We all want  educational  excellence
for our children and not controlled mediocrity. There is wisdom in  the  old
adage that you cannot embrace the poor by tearing down the rich.

The curbing of the powers of governing bodies to top up salaries  of  state-
employed teachers may not be a bad policy after all, but the timing is  bad.
This is  time  to  build  trust  and  not  to  sow  cynicism  regarding  the
Ministry's policies. We should not at this time subject private  initiatives
which promote excellence in education to state  bureaucrats  who  themselves
still  need  to  be  transformed  into  effective   "revocrats",   and   not
bureaucrats, in the service of the South  African  revolutionary  state.  We
need "revocrats" in the service of the South African revolutionary stage.  I
repeat, we need "revocrats" and not bureaucrats. [Interjections.]

If I had time, I would explain this to you, Mr Minister. If there  had  been
problems associated with the topping up of salaries by governing bodies,  we
sincerely believe that these should have been addressed in a less  stringent
manner in the form of general guidelines to school governing  bodies.  In  a
revolutionary state such  as  ours,  rigid  adherence  to  rules  which  are
themselves rigid, such as labour laws, does not enhance service delivery.
The character of our transition means that we must enhance  the  ability  of
all our segments of our society,  including  former  Model  C  schools,  for
effective service delivery. I sincerely believe that  we  will  not  achieve
this through the introduction of this amendment.

Of course, we are not so naive  as  to  believe  that  transformation  is  a
neutral process. It is by definition a purposeful process  and  as  such  it
contains some  elements  of  social  engineering,  and  social  engineering,
everywhere in the world, has always been accompanied by central control.  In
such situations, especially situations of democratic  centralism,  plurality
of  parties  may  be   tolerated   but   not   the   plurality   of   ideas.
[Interjections.] Plurality of ideas - are you saying that  I'm  not  capable
of generating these ideas, Mr Minister?

Plurality of ideas is always regarded as the  enemy  of  transformation  and
must, as such, be  heavily  censored.  Criticism  of  governing  policies  -
something which is quite acceptable in normal  democracies  -  is  sometimes
treated as high treason. The brand of democracy which  any  political  party
holds is always revealed in its reaction to the  ideas  of  its  opposition.
I'm waiting with bated breath  for  the  hon  Minister's  response  to  this
afternoon's debate.

In  conclusion,  part  of  the  evidence  to  emerge  from   research   into
educational systems suggests that if parents are motivated and involved,  if
school principals are effective leaders,  administrators  and  co-ordinators
of  the  education  process  in  schools,  if  teachers  are   well-trained,
satisfied and motivated, and  if  a  culture  of  learning  and  achievement
exists among learners, then  virtually  any  system  will  be  educationally
effective. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

It's a pity, I was going to refer to you, hon Geldenhuys. [Laughter.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  the  New  NP  are  supporting  this
amendment Bill, ... [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  ...  although  there  are
clauses and issues with which we  are  still  not  happy.  Because  the  hon
Minister agreed to more flexible amendments after discussions,  and  because
the principle is already in the Schools Act of 1996,  we  decided  we  would
support the refining and the clarification that this Bill provides  on  what
is already in that Act as a fact, and also because incentives may  still  be
given to teachers under certain circumstances. [Applause.]

As the Bill states, and I quote:


  The main aim of the amendment  is  not  to  ban  extra  remuneration  for
  educators employed by the state completely, but to curb the irresponsible
  manner in which it is done.

I will add, "sometimes" done.

The New NP is still unhappy that the committee did not have public  hearings
on these issues and, therefore, a totally balanced  view  from  stakeholders
was not  interrogated  by  the  committee.  Written  submissions  cannot  be
substantially verbally interrogated.
There is one aspect, inter alia, which the New NP will not be party to,  and
that is the issue of the autonomy and powers of school governing bodies.  If
we want well-run and well-managed schools, we should leave it  to  the  SGBs
to decide on how their schools should be run, how they raise funds  and  how
they spend them for the good of the schools. That should be  their  decision
because they are democratically elected and are the most closely involved.

If a provincial department feels unhappy about how the schools  are  run  in
the sense of management or governance, the department  should  intervene  by
having officials of the department assist and train  those  SGBs  in  proper
management.  However,  those  SGBs  that  are  performing  well  should   be
acknowledged and be left to govern their schools as they see fit.

Furthermore, if an SGB wants to give any incentives, as  it  deems  fit  and
affordable, to a dedicated teacher, the New NP feels that  the  onus  should
be on the SGB to request permission from the provincial  Minister,  and  not
on a specific teacher  individually.  This  could  be  embarrassing  to  the
teacher and should not happen to a teacher who is already  a  dedicated  and
an excellent teacher. After all, that is exactly why they are being  thanked
by the school community.

The New NP will, therefore, be supporting this Bill  because  the  principle
is already in the Schools Act, and this Bill assists in clarifying  a  vague
clause as far as that is concerned. But  we  stand  strong,  and  we  always
will, hon Doman, on the autonomy of SGBs.  Centralisation  in  education  is
unacceptable because of the many different  focuses  of  the  South  African
landscape, and centralisation leads to being  prescriptive  and  that  again
leads to a bigger bureaucracy, which becomes expensive and top-heavy.

The department  should  rather  do  everything  in  their  power  to  assist
principals with discipline in our schools and leave things  that  work  well
just like that. The complaint by principals about the unacceptable  lack  of
discipline and the difficulty in getting it back  in  schools  needs  to  be
taken seriously, and assistance needs to be given. If human rights begin  to
become human abuse of other people and of an ordinary  environment  for  the
citizens, then we need to have another look at human rights.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister,  this  Bill,  admittedly  a
much-improved version of the original draft,  continues  the  trend  set  in
previous Education Laws Amendment Bills of reducing the relevance of  school
governing bodies in terms of their ability to  represent  parents,  teachers
and learners when it comes to issues of governance.

An amendment proposed by the ACDP would have adequately addressed a  concern
that a lack of transparency in the granting of benefits to teachers by  SGBs
results in hidden costs for parents. This amendment,  which  was  ultimately
dismissed, increased transparency between school governing  bodies  and  the
department and made provision for parents to be well-informed  and  able  to
influence such decisions without restricting the decision-making  powers  of
the SGBs which, after all, represent parents, teachers and learners.

According to the Bill, as it stands now, the department has sole  discretion
as to whether or not state-paid  teachers  may  receive  extra  benefits  or
remuneration paid by parents' bodies. Instead of encouraging South  Africans
to embark  on  teaching  careers  and  retaining  the  much-needed  teaching
skills, this Bill will further exacerbate serious shortages  of  specialised
and experienced teachers in public  schools  and  will  have  a  detrimental
effect on education.

Only newly qualified teachers, with little or no experience,  will  be  able
to afford to teach in public schools and, even then, the number  of  trainee
teachers  has  been  dropping  steadily.  Lack  of  incentives  and   career
prospects will further discourage young South  Africans  from  embarking  on
teaching careers and encourage teachers to move into  other  more  lucrative
professions. There's  nothing  to  stop  Government  from  offering  special
incentives to excellent and  specialised  teachers  to  work  in  rural  and
previously underprivileged schools.

The need to  improve  education  standards  in  many  schools  is  of  grave
importance, but will not be achieved by shifting focus  from  what  has  not
been accomplished to diminishing what has  been  accomplished  in  order  to
level the playing fields. It's never helpful to cut off one's
nose to spite one's face.

The ruling party and the department are of  the  opinion  that  because  the
state pays teachers,  these  teachers  belong  to  them.  Teachers  are,  of
course, paid with taxpayers' money and the state is  only  an  administrator
of the funds. Parents should have the final say in how their money is  spent
on their children,

While the ACDP is uncompromising  in  its  support  for  accountability  and
transparency, we are concerned that the Government is making decisions  that
should not be theirs to make. We will, therefore, vote against the Bill,
With reference to your earlier comment, hon Minister, I have a  29-year  old
son, 21-year old daughter, 19-year  old  son  and  a  9-year  old  son.  I'm
perhaps not as out of touch with reality as you might think. No  matter  how
many young people sell  themselves  short  or  are  trapped  in  an  abusive
situation, there is no excuse for adults to refuse them  protection.  It  is
shameful when  legislation  is  aimed  at  assisting  them  in  their  self-
destruction, and I refer here to your response in terms of the reduction  of
the age of consent in the sexual offences Bill. Thank you.

Dr C P  MULDER:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Mr  Minister,  I  despair  of  the
education profession in South Africa. Do we have any  idea  of  the  current
crisis in the  education  profession?  I  have  been  sitting  in  a  school
governing body for the past three years, Mr Minister.  We  deal  with  these
things on a daily basis.

What message are we sending to the teachers and parents  out  there  with  a
measure like this? Are we striving for excellence or  are  we  striving  for
mediocrity? I want to put it to the hon Mayatula - the chairperson  of  this
committee: You have just said in your speech that all the Bill says is  that
the school governing body should consult the employer. I  challenge  you  to
show me where it says that in this Bill. It does not  stand  in  this  Bill.
There is nothing about ``consult''. They must apply and get the approval  of
the department. Why  are  you  telling  Parliament  that  they  should  only
consult the employer? [Interjections.] That's not true, that's not  true!  I
despair of the profession if that is the way in which  the  committee  deals
with Bills like these.

Mevrou Adjunk-speaker,  die  vraag  wat  die  departement  en  die  Minister
hulself moet afvra,  is:  [Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  question  that  the
department and the Minister must ask themselves is:]

Why, in the first instance, did school governing bodies  find  it  necessary
to pay teachers extra - why? Because teachers are not paid  enough  in  this
country and because teachers are leaving the profession on  a  daily  basis.
Are the department and the Minister aware of that fact? What are  you  doing
about that?

Now, the school governing bodies are  getting  involved  in  the  situation.
They try to rectify this and they are now being prevented  in  the  process.
It is no use saying that the Bill  doesn't  prevent  that.  Technically  and
administratively, it becomes impossible to do that. So, what are  we  trying
to achieve here? Mr Minister, with all due respect, reconsider  this.  Allow
people who want to assist the education profession to do  that.  Don't  make
it more difficult for them, make it easier.

Then, to my colleagues in the New NP I would like to say that I have  warned
you in the past that the ANC will not stop until they have destroyed you  in
total. Can't you see what's happening? Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy  Speaker  and  hon  members,  experience  and  rapid
changes in the educational field necessitate regular amendments to  existing
laws, and the Bill we are discussing seeks to address just that.

The UCDP considers teaching as a labour of love. Our position is that  those
who engage in teaching should have passion for the job and not look  forward
to making wealth instantly. We, therefore, do  not  condone  any  additional
payment to a teacher over and above the approved remuneration  according  to
the teacher's grading or salary scale.  But,  in  the  public  interest,  we
support the proposed insertion of section 38A in Act 84  of  1996.  For  the
record, this is in keeping with the Public Service Act of 1994.

Teachers took up teaching by choice with full knowledge of  what  they  were
letting themselves  in  for.  Teachers,  as  professionals,  should  not  be
treated like waiters and waitresses who  look  forward  to  tips  for  doing
their work well. We maintain that teachers should find fulfilment  in  their
work knowing that the greatest of remunerations is yet to  come.  Whilst  we
subscribe to John Dewey's naturalism, education, to  us,  has  no  room  for
laissez faire. Educators should comply with all set regulations.

Finally, we support the Bill in its  entirety,  Mr  Minister,  but  we  have
difficulty in regard to retrospective legislation that has been used in  the
case of establishing the council known as Umalusi. The name  has  been  used
for  a  considerable  time  and  a  glossy  report  has  been  presented  to
Parliament in that good and appropriate name already. While  the  intent  is
good and welcome, the route followed in naming the  institution  borders  on
taking  Parliament  for  granted.  We  call  on  the  Minister  not  to  use
Parliament as a rubber stamp. There is no  point  in  asking  Parliament  to
legislate on something that is already in use and in the  public  domain.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy Speaker, education in a country that is a  cross
between the First World and Third  World  is  problematic  at  the  best  of
times.

Before assessing the core problem that is addressed  by  this  Bill,  it  is
necessary  to  affirm  that  good  education  remains  the   only   way   of
accelerating development in a country that has inherited grave  inequalities
such as ours. Education should be  of  a  reasonably  good  quality  and  be
affordable and attainable for all the children  of  the  country.  There  is
also the problem  of  high  competition  from  the  commercial  field  which
results in the brain-drain of well-qualified teachers.

The fact that the problem  of  paying  inducement  allowances  to  educators
exists shows that, indeed, there is a problem.  One  solution  suggested  by
the Bill is, namely,  that  the  school  governing  bodies  should  be  held
accountable as they are the ones who lure educators away by  promising  them
additional  allowances  and  other  types  of  incentives.  This   underhand
operation is a form of  corruption  and  impacts  negatively  on  the  whole
educational system.

The poor schools cannot compete favourably with rich ones  and,  with  time,
the gap becomes bigger and the corruption that goes with  it  continues.  It
must be noted that the Bill does leave an open door  for  exceptional  cases
but the process must be transparent and negotiated openly.

One final word for the poor schools: Whilst we argue the case for  the  rich
schools, the many schools in our country that are not improving  and  hardly
have basic facilities stick out like a sore thumb and remind  us  where  the
major problem and challenges lie. With that terse  reminder,  the  PAC  will
support the Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  MF  commends  the  education
department in its  efforts  to  correct  the  imbalances  in  the  country's
education. With reference to the adjustments and provisions that  this  Bill
makes, the MF has no objections to the increase in the number of  educators'
representatives from two to three within the SA Qualifications Authority.

Noting that there are three main teachers' unions,  it  is  felt  that  that
should balance representation. There are no objections to the  reinstatement
of a member  more  than  the  stipulated  once.  In  light  of  his  or  her
contribution regarding expertise and experience, his  or  her  reinstatement
may prove beneficial.

Provisions made in view of the salaries  of  educators  are  reasonable  and
supported. The MF feels it's  necessary  that  educational  institutes  make
reports available to parents and guardians regarding money spent  in  paying
educators'  salaries.  That  will  allow  for  greater  accountability   and
transparency.

Further, the MF supports the provisions made in light of educators  who  are
employed by school governing bodies. The MF is sure that the  provisions  in
this Bill will serve to take care of remuneration of  educators  adequately.
Basically, provisions made in the employment  of  educators  are  reasonable
and supported.

The MF is especially supportive of the renaming of the Council  for  General
and Further Education and Training Quality  Assurance  to  Umalusi'',  which
means "guardian of family assets". That name is  most  appropriate  for  the
institute that manages general, further education and training. An  educated
nation makes for a stronger nation. The MF wishes uMalusi every  success  in
its endeavours and supports the Education Laws Amendment  Bill.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Deputy Speaker, it seems to me that the new  and  eminent
alliance has tuned both the IFP and the FF into the fight-back mode.

'n Belangrike motief vir hierdie wetswysiging is dat die  bestaande  praktyk
van addisionële vergoeding deur skoolbeheerliggame in stryd is met  die  Wet
op die Indiensneming van Opvoeders en die Staatsdienswet,  soos  breedvoerig
in die memorandum beskryf. Hier  is  egter  weer  'n  geval  van  die  regte
diagnose, maar die verkeerde medisyne.

In  stede  daarvan  om  die  betrokke  bestaande  wetgewing  te   wysig   om
voorsiening te maak vir hierdie uitnemende funksie  van  bestuursliggame  om
dit wettiglik en ordelik te doen met vasgestelde riglyne, word  die  kortpad
gevat en hierdie bevoegdheid hul ontneem. Weer eens word die  kind  met  die
badwater uitgegooi.

Die Nasionale Aksie is ook nie oortuig deur die argument in  die  memorandum
dat sodanige vergoeding 'n regsplig op die departement plaas  nie.  Eerstens
is 'n bestuursliggaam  'n  regspersoon  in  eie  reg  en  tweedens,  hierdie
wetswysiging verplaas juis die onus na werkgewers synde die departement.

Die  beproefde  merietestelsel  word  nie  meer  in   die   departement   op
onderwysers toegepas nie, uitnemendheid word nie meer beloon nie;  nou  word
die wettige verteenwoordigers van die ouers die reg ontneem om dit te  doen.
Die  toestemming  wat  die  wetswysiging  vereis  sal  ook  tydskedules   se
begrotingsdoeleindes ernstig ontwrig. Ons sou maatreëls ondersteun  het  wat
riglyne  ook  vir  deursigtigheid   uit   die   begrotingsproses   daarstel.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[An important motive for this  statutory  amendment  is  that  the  existing
practice of  additional  remuneration  by  school  governing  bodies  is  in
conflict with the Employment of Educators Act and the  Public  Service  Act,
as comprehensively described in the memorandum. However, this is once  again
a case of the correct diagnosis, but the incorrect remedy.

Instead of amending the relevant existing legislation to make provision  for
this excellent function of governing bodies to be carried out  lawfully  and
in an orderly fashion with specified guidelines, a short cut  is  taken  and
this power is taken away from them. Once again the baby is thrown  out  with
the bath water.

The National Action is also not convinced by the argument in the  memorandum
that  such  remuneration  places  a  legal  obligation  on  the  department.
Firstly, a governing body is  a  judicial  person  in  its  own  right  and,
secondly, this statutory amendment in fact transfers the onus to  employers,
namely, the department.

The proven merit system is no longer applied to teachers in the  department,
excellence is no longer rewarded;  now  the  legal  representatives  of  the
parents are denied the right to  do  so.  The  permission  required  by  the
statutory amendment will also seriously disrupt the budgetary objectives  of
time  schedules.  We  would  have  supported  measures   which   established
guidelines for transparency from the budget process as well.]

However,  hon  Minister,  transparency  and  accountability  will   not   be
guaranteed by taking away the rights of SGBs; they can  only  be  guaranteed
by way of a transparent and accountable budget process.

Om egter die beslissingsreg na die  departement  te  verskuif,  ontneem  die
bestuursliggaam en die ouers die basiese reg en plig om iets addisioneel  te
offer vir kwaliteit onderrig aan hul kinders. Wil u die situasie  bestendig,
Minister, dat top onderwysers toenemend die professie verlaat en na  London,
na die privaatsektor te gaan, om dalk  deur  Kubane  vervang  te  word?  Die
Minister behoort elke ekstra rand wat vrywillig deur ouers  betaal  word  te
verwelkom as 'n onverdiende bonus en nie wetgewing in te  stel  om  dit  aan
bande te lê nie.

Die NA  sal  teen  hierdie  wetgewing  stem.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[However, to transfer the right of determination to  the  department  denies
the governing body and the parents the basic right and duty to  offer  extra
for quality tuition for their children.  Do  you  want  to  consolidate  the
situation, Minister, where top educators increasingly leave  the  profession
to go to London, or the private sector, possibly to be replaced  by  Cubans?
The Minister should welcome every extra rand voluntarily paid by parents  as
an undeserved bonus and not introduce legislation to curb this. The NA  will
vote against this legislation. I thank you.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Madam Deputy Speaker, I dedicate this debate to  Eric  Molobi
who harnessed many of us as young people into  the  education  movement  and
inculcated in us a passion for education as a  tool  for  change,  and  many
other comrades sitting here were together with Comrade Eric Molobi in  doing
so. I further thank Comrade  Maxwell  Komphela,  Ntate  Tolo,  Mama  Storey,
Josephine Tshivhase, Thoko Didiza and Simeone Nkanunu,  an  officer  in  the
Chief Whip's office, for their continuing support and  encouragement  in  my
work.

Hon Olckers and hon Mulder, I will come back to you because you have  raised
some reasonable, but  debatable  issues  in  your  inputs.  Hon  Doman,  the
Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on  Education  dealt  with  you  more
than efficiently ... [Interjections.]

AN HON MEMBER: Doman.

Ms M P MENTOR: Whoever you are - honourable; and  I  am  sure  the  Minister
will also deal with you efficiently, but one thing that I must  say  to  you
outright is that you cannot be and are not the representative of  the  poor.
You represent the interests of the rich. [Interjections.]  You  have  always
done that. The last thing you said is about voting. The ANC is committed  to
changing the lives of the poor for the better on an ongoing basis and  on  a
daily basis. This is not about the votes as it is for you.

At the beginning of 1990 we as the ANC, its alliance partners  and  the  MDM
formations took stock of the decades of the struggle for  freedom.  At  that
time, in 1990, we correctly said that the decade that was coming  in  was  a
decade in which we were going to deliver freedom. We  were  correct  and  we
were spot-on because four years down the line as the ANC  and  its  alliance
partners and MDM formations,  we  delivered  freedom  and  change  to  South
Africans - black and white, rich and poor. At that time,  in  1990  when  we
were saying, ``victory is certain'', the same  people  who  are  opposed  to
change today, who are opposed to this Bill today, were still sitting on  the
other side. They were saying we were wrong and they unleashed  brutality  on
us including the schooling system and learners. They did  so  by  unleashing
the  then  so-called  black-on-black  violence  that  even  floated  to  the
schools. They also unleashed the  taxi  violence  which  affected  schooling
detrimentally.
Today you are sitting here again. You have just changed your modus  operandi
because we  have  ushered  in  freedom,  we  have  stabilised  South  Africa
politically, and we have stabilised the  playing  fields  in  terms  of  the
provisioning of education. Now your modus operandi is  one  of  gatekeeping,
of making sure that you keep the poor on  that  side  with  regard  to  them
receiving the best skills in relation to educators. [Applause.]

Today we are taking stock of 10 years of democracy and freedom. When  we  do
so we quickly want to remind you, in case you have forgotten,  of  the  many
achievements we have achieved in  education.  We  managed  to  integrate  11
racially  divided  and  unevenly  developed  education  systems   into   one
meaningful, united system of  education.  We  have  put  in  place  new  and
democratic frameworks, policies and legislation. We have put in place a  new
skills and development orientated curriculum. We have put  in  place  a  new
qualifications framework and new quality assurance  procedures  and  systems
because  you  were  saying  when  we  integrate  the  departments   we   are
necessarily bringing the standards down.  We  have  put  in  place  national
norms and  standards  for  education.  The  teacher-pupil  ratios  that  are
bringing in the factor of equality in education you are against even  today.
But even as we are taking stock of freedom and  our  achievements,  you  are
saying: "What freedom?". You are still asking that question and yet you  are
claiming to be representing the poor. I mean even a blind man can  see  that
we have brought about change in the lives of the poor.  [Interjections.]  It
is only you who continue to pretend that we have not brought any  meaningful
change to education.

In this Bill that we support as the ANC, we are saying to you that  we  will
refuse and we will continue to refuse, as  the  ANC,  to  ensure  that  only
those who are rich can afford that their children can have the  best  highly
skilled and highly paid  educators.  We  are  defending  the  right  of  the
children of the poor to  have  equal  access  to  highly-skilled  educators,
because if we do not defend that right the children  of  the  rich  in  this
country, who will be going to those schools that we say must give  the  SGBs
thereof the right to appoint and pay extra as they wish,  will  continue  to
have an edge in terms of knowledge and an edge in terms of skills  over  the
children of the poor and that is not acceptable.  [Applause.]  We  want  the
children of the poor in this country to have an edge and to succeed in  life
just like the children of those who have and who can afford it.  It  is  the
responsibility of the state to intervene and to make sure that in  terms  of
national  skills  transfer  and  in  terms   of   human   resource   capital
distribution the children of the poorest of the poor, whether  they  are  in
rural areas or in semirural areas, in urban areas or  in  peri-urban  areas,
whether  their  parents  have  money  or  not,  also   have   highly-skilled
educators.

If we follow the arguments of those who  are  opposing  this  Bill  the  net
effect of doing what you say we must do would be  that  the  public  schools
will be stripped of these highly-skilled educators. They  will  be  teaching
only in pockets of schools that have money and that is  not  acceptable.  We
will not allow that to happen. We have a responsibility as a state  to  make
sure that the norms and standards ... in fact what you  are  proposing  will
also have another effect of  ensuring  that  the  curriculum  is  skewed  in
favour of those who have money  and  whose  children  attend  schools  where
school fees can be R10 000 or R11 000.

If we do not intervene as the state the children of the poor  will  continue
to be given housecraft, carpentry  and  lessons  in  obedience  as  was  the
status quo under apartheid. We are refusing when we vote for this  Bill.  We
are saying that we are in favour of the poor, that we will  make  sure  that
we use this power that is vested in us as the state to  make  sure  that  we
protect the children of the poor, and we will make  sure  that  they  access
quality education for all just  like  the  children  of  the  rich  and  the
children of those who can afford to pay educators more.

Coming  back  to  you  hon  Olckers,  you  are  arguing  for  autonomy   and
independence of SGBs and you are saying the department must play a  role  of
discipline which to me is "kragdadigheid"  [forcefulness].  [Interjections.]
If we say the only role that the state can play is a  disciplinary  one,  we
as the ANC refuse to accept that our schools will be a means  of  federalism
and a splintered approach to education. We have a responsibility  to  ensure
that we set national standards, that we monitor nationally and that  we  put
in place uniform standards for education. We cannot  allow  each  and  every
one of these many SGBs depending on whether they have money or not to do  as
they please and to retain power for themselves.

Lastly, Madam Olckers all your arguments were reasonable and  I  think  that
is the reason you see fit to also defend the poor  and  vote  in  favour  of
this Bill. Hon Doman ... [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: Doman.

Ms M P MENTOR: Can you pronounce my  name?  You  are  saying  that  we  must
retain the power and rights of the SGBs who happen in many cases to  be  the
select few. We are saying to you in return that we will restore  and  retain
the power and the rights to and for the poor, and not  the  select  few  who
are the elite and who happen to make it onto the SGBs. And this is  not  all
about voting. It is about ensuring that there is even  distribution  of  the
human resource capital, that the children of the poor get what  they  should
be getting which is what the children  of  the  rich  are  getting  in  this
country. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, hon members, I come to speak to  you
- Mr Mpontshane asked me to respond to his intervention - with a feeling  of
exhilaration on the one hand, and  extreme  depression  on  the  other.  The
exhilaration is the result of listening to the chairperson of the  portfolio
committee coming out of his corner like a  light-heavyweight  champion.  For
the first time in six years, he has come out pugnaciously, vibrantly,  in  a
lively fashion, and anticipated so much of the things I wanted to  say.  The
hon Mayatula has, in fact, done that. [Interjections.]

And then of course, in the best tradition of debate, the hon  Mentor  -  the
name ``Mentor'' is very appropriate,  by  the  way  -  has  replied  in  the
debate. I regret to say that my depression is that there will be  those  who
will never listen to anything you say. [Interjections.]

I spent one hour with the hon Doman. Look ...  [Interjections]  ...  if  the
jackals would listen instead of pecking away. [Laughter.] I spent  one  hour
with the  hon  Doman  going  through  the  Bill  systematically,  privately.
[Interjections.] Now please! I think this side is  skirmishing.  I'll  speak
to the middle. [Interjections.] No!  This  was  a  private  meeting  at  his
request. Ministers don't have private meetings, and particularly with  those
people who are confused about the Bill. He had not read  the  Bill  properly
because I had to draw his attention to the fact that  the  Bill  won't  come
into force until next year to give schools  time  to  adjust,  because  he'd
asked me if we could have a postponement of the Bill. But then,  of  course,
when we look at the Bill, it is there.

The hon Doman makes me depressed for the simple reason  that  his  side  has
never supported,  since  1994,  a  single  piece  of  legislation  which  is
progressive, which meets the moment of the time  and  the  day.  [Applause.]
They claim the school governing body  concept.  The  school  governing  body
concept came from the ANC, and  it  was  fathered  and  supported  by  Blade
Nzimande through Parliament, as the  transfer  of  power  and  democracy  to
localism. [Interjections.] That is not rubbish; you were not even a  boy  by
then, in 1994. [Applause.] You were not around. This  concept,  I  can  tell
you, is our position and it is to enhance the  school  governing  body  and,
when the report of the school governing bodies comes out, to strengthen  the
school governing body.

So, please, no one is taking power  away  from  the  school  governing  body
because the school governing body doesn't have the power  at  present.  What
we are trying to do, and I think this is very important, is to provide  some
regulation, as I said in my  speech,  in  a  position  which  is  impossible
because we are paying additional amounts  to  public  servants  where  other
public servants are not allowed to be paid.

The hon Mr Doman was also economical with the truth. It's not  true  to  say
that you must go to court to resolve the matter. He looks like a  lugubrious
minister. He might be a lugubrious lawyer for all I know, but he would  know
that under the Administration of Justice Act, the  administrative  decisions
have to be  taken  reasonably  quickly.  It  says  so,  ``within  reasonable
time''. Of course, it's bad faith on the part of any  public  authority,  an
MEC or head of a department, to take an unreasonable amount of time.

I did say that we will monitor the  legislation  if,  in  fact,  it  is  not
working. [Interjections.] No, no, it's there in the record  of  Hansard.  We
will monitor it. So don't be economical with the truth.

In the same way, hon Aucamp - I like your style, by the  way,  but  not  the
content - you cannot have two employers. Under the contract  of  employment,
there is an employer, which is the province, and the individual teacher.  If
you, in fact, try to act in addition to that, then there is a  supplementary
employer. Legally it's  not  possible  to  have  a  supplementary  employer.
Therefore what we are saying is that there must  be  some  machinery  acting
quickly to do that.

The last point I'll make on this is that there is a clear division  in  this
House between  privilege  and  fairness,  between  those  who  speak  for  a
minority, I must say. In the last opinion poll,  more  than  a  5%  increase
from 1994 said that there was a considerable improvement in education.  That
is the large majority of people. We speak for a large  majority  of  people.
[Interjections.] No, no, you don't know.

You don't even have the insight into the caucus of the ANC. You  don't  even
have an insight into rural schools or township schools.  [Interjections.]  I
can tell you, I'll patronise you all the time. I like patronising you, so  I
will continue patronising you. Therefore I will  speak  on  the  basis  that
there is a real need to regulate this. Mr Aucamp, the school governing  body
then is not being abolished.

As for the hon Mr Mpontshane, I must react to his mumbo-jumbo  about  trust,
and  trust  and  development,  and  all  that.  Are  you  saying  that  your
constituency in Ingwavuma does not need  the  so-called  excellent  teacher,
because they cannot pay him or her more than the state pays? Are you  really
saying that? Should you accept their fate and sit down?

Let me end all the debate by  reading  a  very  moving  article  by  Lindiwe
Khuzwayo in the Star of  29  May.  She  looks  at  the  schools  with  great
privilege and facilities and says: ``... the people who work  in  advantaged
schools are being rewarded, not so much for what they do, as for where  they
work. The elements are all there ... '' for all wonderful  facilities.  And,
since the hon Doman now suddenly acquires an insight to speak for  the  poor
and underprivileged schools, I'll quote further:


  Given all this, why on earth would these teaching ``stars'' not shine? If
  you took many of those ``hardworking'',  perk-getting  stars  and  placed
  them at a school in a squatter camp, where children come not having  seen
  a slice of bread, a different story would emerge.


  Yet the people who currently work under these conditions don't  complain,
  they plod along quietly and occasionally produce  stunning  results.  And
  they work overtime. I know teachers in  township  schools  who  teach  on
  Sundays.


  Yes, on Sundays, never mind Saturdays. But they don't get any  perks.  In
  fact, many of them do not even know that other teachers receive perks.


  Who is going to recognise these teachers and reward them?


  I can understand Asmal's reasoning about the perks. What they  are  doing
  is perpetuating, not only inequalities in  our  educational  system,  but
  myths as well.

She concludes:


  The argument that if perks  are  stopped  teachers  will  be  poached  by
  private schools is laughable. If this were the case  there  would  be  no
  longer any teachers in excellent township schools, where teachers perform
  what can only be described as miracles.

I ask for the case that salutes the miraculous. Support those who go out  of
their way, whether they are black or white. But  don't  always  insist  that
those privileges that exist must be perpetuated, unregulated by law. To  get
rid of this myth, with due respect to the hon Mentor, it is not  up  to  the
school governing body to decide  on  this.  It  is  the  principal  and  the
chairperson of the governing body who decide on this. We  have  evidence  of
that.

Annual salaries do not include all the perquisites by name. In  fact,  these
are quiet arrangements made with teachers themselves, the unions  will  tell
you. Teachers will tell you  that  there  is  a  great  deal  of  resentment
because  they  don't  know  the  conditions  under  which,  in  fact,  these
perquisites are given.
What we are  saying  is  that  additional  work  is  open  work;  additional
capacity-building is open. We ask you therefore to support this  because  we
cannot tolerate a situation where there are two school  systems  within  one
school. No principal is capable of determining, for example, performance  in
the way, in fact, that educational experts do. No chairman  of  a  governing
body can say this teacher is performing beyond any recognition,  beyond  any
situation. We  are  now  putting  in  a  performance  grading  system  where
teachers will receive that.

Hon Mulder, it's a myth about teachers deserting. There are  more  and  more
people joining the faculties  of  education.  What  have  we  done?  We  are
offering to poor Afrikaners R100  million  in  the  National  Financial  Aid
Scheme to do what you said, to get teachers into the  system.  We  are  also
now carrying out, for the  first  time,  a  survey  of  tuberculosis,  other
diseases and HIV as they affect teachers. We are doing it systematically.

Mr Doman may never appear on the front page of the Financial Mail.  I  don't
care about appearing on their front page because, I can tell you, they  have
their own agenda. They are speaking to businesses, as he says,  and  not  to
anybody else. I speak for ``the great unwashed'',  as  George  Orwell  said.
And for ``the great unwashed'', we persevere  with  all  the  great  reforms
that the hon Mentor has mentioned. We  persevere  because  somebody  has  to
articulate their needs. And we believe, ourselves, that  we  speak  for  the
large majority of people in saying there should be no privileges on the  one
hand and underdevelopment on the other. I commend this Bill  to  you.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

           CONSIDERATION OF FIRST REPORT OF JOINT BUDGET COMMITTEE

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson and  hon  members,  today  we  consider  the  First
Report of the Joint Budget Committee that was tabled on 18  June  2003.  The
theme for our discussion is the role of the state  Budget  in  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty. The establishment of the  Joint  Budget  Committee
was the culmination of extensive work, which was done by the  budget  reform
task team with the sole purpose of giving Parliament the platform to  engage
with the Budget process.

Key among the objectives of the committee is giving effect  to  the  central
question of participatory budgeting and improved quality of  spending,  with
a particular focus on accountability, transparency and good governance.  The
Budget,  being  the  instrument  of  expressing  Government  policy,  should
respond  to  the  prevailing  material  conditions  and  challenges  in  our
country.
The ANC made  a  commitment  at  its  inception  to  eradicate  poverty  and
dispossession when it was formed in 1912 and it has been dedicated  to  this
course to this day. Over the years we have defined the  strategic  objective
of  the  national  democratic  revolution  as  the  creation  of  a  united,
nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.

The Budget reform measures have shifted the purpose of the Budget  from  its
narrow  focus  on  prudent  stewardship  to  embrace  the   development   of
sustainable programmes to deliver the quality services that will  push  back
the frontiers of poverty, grow the economy ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Nene. Order! Hon members,  can  we
have your attention please. Order! Order, hon members! Please continue,  hon
Nene.

Mr N M NENE: Chairperson, I was saying that the Budget reform measures  have
shifted the  purpose  of  the  Budget  from  its  narrow  focus  on  prudent
stewardship to embrace the development of sustainable programmes to  deliver
the quality services that will push back the frontiers of poverty, grow  the
economy and also create an environment for employment.

We have emerged from a past that kept the Budget in the purview of a  select
few, mainly the bureaucrats, to determine  and  implement  that  which  they
thought would be in the best interests of  society.  This  resulted  in  the
skewed distribution of income, huge budget  deficits  and  an  economy  with
negative growth. It took the ANC and its policies  to  turn  this  situation
around, and indeed major strides have been made to produce a Budget that  is
both an effective and efficient instrument of  policy  that  recognises  the
developmental character of our state.

When this committee was established it was  tasked,  through  its  terms  of
reference, with considering the  proposed  allocations  in  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure  Framework  and  the  appropriation  Bill  and   whether   these
allocations  were  in  broad  keeping  with  Government  policy  directions.
Secondly, it was tasked  with  considering  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement, when tabled, and reporting to Parliament. Thirdly, it was  tasked
with making proposals regarding the processes Parliament should follow  with
regard to its  role  in  the  development  of  budgets  in  accordance  with
constitutional requirements. Lastly,  it  was  tasked  with  monitoring  the
monthly  published  actual  revenue  and  expenditure  per  department,   to
ascertain whether these were in line with budget projections, and to  report
quarterly, as we are doing today.

The period for which we are reporting is the last quarter of  2002-03  which
ended in March 2003. The other members of the committee are  going  to  deal
with specific cluster expenditure trends and their impact  on  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty.

Departmental  expenditure,  according  to  the  report,  showed  a   gradual
increase  in  the  last  quarter,  with  some  dramatic   fluctuations   and
pronounced increased expenditure in the month of March 2003. This  situation
raises questions of possible fiscal dumping - and I repeat, possible  fiscal
dumping - and the committee is monitoring the situation  more  closely  this
time and awaits  explanations  and  rigorous  engagement  by  committees  as
annual reports are being tabled.

Allow me to take this opportunity to urge  all  committees  to  engage  with
their respective  departments  as  they  table  these  annual  reports.  The
tabling of these reports should not be regarded  as  one  of  those  routine
processes that this  House  should  receive  and  discard,  as  the  reports
provide committees with additional tools to hold departments accountable.

We have  a  responsibility  as  public  representatives  to  safeguard  this
democracy with its institutions, as laid down in the  Constitution  and  the
Bill of Rights. It is our duty to accelerate the pace  of  implementing  the
accountability  system  of  better  performance  in  service  delivery   and
financial management by fully and properly implementing the  management  and
performance reforms, like the Public  Finance  Management  Act,  the  Senior
Management Service, and, recently, the Local Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Act.

Ensuring  civil-society  participation   at   all   levels   is   also   our
responsibility. We must ensure that at the local  level  there  is  adequate
participation of our  society  in  the  formulation  of  the  IDPs.  At  the
provincial  level  we  must  ensure  that  society  participates  in  public
hearings.  At  the  national  level  we  should  also  ensure  that  society
participates  in  public  hearings  and   engages   with   the   Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework.

In the report the committee makes proposals which  we  believe  require  the
commitment of all of us working  together,  with  the  common  objective  of
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. The committee is  of  the  view  that
key among these recommendations is that of  capacity-building  in  financial
management procedures  for  departments,  especially  regarding  the  Public
Finance Management Act, in order to ensure compliance  with  this  Act.  The
committee is also convinced that capacity-building for members in  financial
oversight is of the utmost importance. Technical and  research  support  for
the committee is also identified as very crucial  in  order  to  enable  the
committee and its members to fulfil their obligation optimally.

In the  Estimate  of  Expenditure,  departments  set  themselves  measurable
objectives which they are expected to achieve.  The  committee  takes  these
very seriously and expects the departments to  adhere  to  them  religiously
and to report timeously on their outputs.

In terms of the committee having to make proposals regarding  the  processes
that Parliament should follow with regard to its role in the  developing  of
budgets in accordance with constitutional requirements, the committee  notes
with comfort that the Joint Rules Committee  has  recognised  the  need  for
Parliament to  give  effect  to  section  77(2)  of  the  Constitution.  The
committee is also pursuing the matter with the  caution  it  requires,  such
that it feeds into the overall objective of  oversight  and  influencing  of
the Budget process.

In our workshop the committee was  presented  with  scenarios  of  countries
that have amendment powers and those that do not.  We  were  convinced  that
even though the amendment powers are desirable, sequencing and  implementing
our terms of reference is of utmost  importance.  Once  the  draft  Bill  is
ready, the committee will have hearings that will take on  board  the  views
of other stakeholders,  more  particularly  civil  society  and  the  labour
movement. What emerged is that even those countries that  had  these  powers
hardly used them. If they did, it would be as a last resort.

Allow me to thank all members of the  committee  for  their  dedication  and
valuable  contributions  in  shaping  this  report.  At  no  stage  did   we
experience party-political posturing and unnecessary disagreements. We  hope
that this spirit prevails both in this debate and as we all work  towards  a
nonracist, nonsexist  and  democratic  Budget  process  and  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

My appreciation also goes to the National  Treasury,  to  the  Minister  and
Deputy Minister of Finance for their  continued  support,  and  to  all  the
support staff, including the research unit, for their hard work in the  past
few months. I trust that they will continue to support this  worthy  course.
I present this report of the Joint Budget Committee to this House and  trust
that it will form the  basis  for  our  reports,  our  debates  and  further
budgetary processes. I also invite members to take some time to  peruse  and
engage our second report, which has  already  appeared  in  the  ATC  of  11
September 2003. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr J L THERON: Hon Chairperson, the topic of my speech today  is:  ``Please,
Get the Show on the Road''.  Some  of  the  ANC  Government's  most  serious
problems are: too slow economic growth, ... [Interjections.] Please  listen!
Some of the ANC Government's most serious problems  are  too  slow  economic
growth, very high unemployment and  growing  poverty.  [Interjections.]  You
want to push back the frontiers of poverty, but there is growing poverty.

If we analyse the First Report of the Joint Budget Committee, the JBC,  very
carefully, some of the reasons for these problems become evident.  Today,  I
want to concentrate on two areas in the report to show  clearly  where  some
of the problems of the  ANC  Government  lie.  I  want  to  comment  on  the
expenditure of the Department of Public Enterprises, the DPE, and  secondly,
on the expenditure of the provinces. If you analyse the report  properly  it
will become clear that these are two of the pertinent issues.

Firstly, I want to look at the Department  of  Public  Enterprises,  or  the
DPE. In the report the three months under review are January,  February  and
March 2003. If we look at the tables for the least total budget  expenditure
for January, the Department of Public Enterprises spent  the  second  least,
with only 54,8% of its budget spent and 45,92% still unspent. For  February,
which is the second last month of the  financial  year,  the  Department  of
Public Enterprises again spent the second least, with  only  68,12%  of  the
budget spent, and 31,88% of the total budget still unspent. For  March,  the
last month of the financial year, the Department of Public  Enterprises  was
the department with the lowest total budget expenditure, with 89,64%  spent,
and 10,09% unspent.

The question is: Is this an example of  fiscal  dumping,  yes  or  no?  From
this,  it  is  already  clear  that  there  are  capacity  problems  at  the
Department of Public Enterprises  because  it  is  the  worst  performer  on
expenditure for the year 2003-04.

But to go one step further, and I really  think  here  some  explanation  is
necessary, if you look at the Second Report of the Joint  Budget  Committee,
the JBC, to which the chairperson referred, and which is already  published,
the Department of Public Enterprises only got  R60  million  in  the  annual
budget for the year 2003-04, while  it  got  R249  million  in  the  revised
estimates for the year 2002-03. This 2003-04 amount is only 25% of what  the
department got in 2002-03. And then, suddenly,  because  of  this  very  low
budget allocation for  2003-04,  the  department  is  shown  as  the  second
highest on departmental expenditure for April 2003-04. We  know  that  there
are extra allocations that have been  announced  such  as  the  R80  billion
upgrade for Spoornet and the  infrastructure  upgrade  of  the  ports;  but,
something is wrong here.

Under the lowest  budget  expenditure  in  May  2003-04,  again,  there  was
actually negative spending by the department by -11,27%.  It  is  stated  in
the report that the National Treasury will provide the  JBC  with  a  formal
response, clarifying the negative expenditure reflected by  the  department.
We in the JBC will have to determine if this is window-dressing or  what  is
going on in the department. The  department  should  be  one  of  the  first
departments to appear before this committee.

Secondly, regarding the expenditure by the provinces  after  nine  years  of
ANC rule in South Africa, I want to quote  from  the  First  Report  of  the
Joint Budget Committee on the expenditure of  the  provinces.  First  quote:
``All provinces  underspent'';  second  quote:  ``All  provinces  underspent
their capital budgets by an average of 15,70%''; and further  to  the  first
quote: ``A conclusion that may be drawn  from  the  above  pattern  is  that
capacity problems still exist in the provinces such as the Eastern  Cape  to
spend their capital budgets''.

To summarise the situation  on  the  two  areas  that  I  have  illustrated,
namely, the Department  of  Public  Enterprises  and  the  provinces,  there
surely seem to be underspending problems. Some of the reasons for this  that
the First Report of  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  mentions,  are  capacity
problems, flow of information and financial oversight.

We are currently on the verge of an  economic  upswing.  If  the  Government
does not do something soon on this underspending issue, we will not see  the
desired  economic  growth  that  we  urgently   need.   If   the   necessary
infrastructure investment and  job  creation  are  not  facilitated  by  the
Government  soon,  we  will  definitely  miss  the  fruits   of   the   new,
international economic growth phase.

I seriously hope that  the  upcoming  general  election  in  2004  will  not
prohibit the Government from doing the necessary  investment,  job  creation
and poverty alleviation in order to enhance the  economic  growth  in  South
Africa. The time for window-dressing is surely over.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member!

Mr J L THERON: Implementation should now be a priority.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr J L THERON: And, it is more than high time to get the show on  the  road.
I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Theron, could you  return  to  the
podium.

I know you were very busy delivering your  speech,  but  you  ignored  calls
from the Chair to inform you that your time had expired. We  will  allow  it
this time but next time we expect you to apologise to the Chair.

Mr J L THERON: Thank you, Chairperson.

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, we would like to begin by just acknowledging  the
very important role played by our chairperson, the hon Nene,  together  with
his co-chairperson from the NCOP. We find the approach very purposeful at  a
very difficult time, being a new committee in  its  formative  and  fledging
stage. We have every confidence that the  committee  is  going  to  grow  in
authority and in the role that we are planning for it.

I can't quite place the same compliment to the report  before  us.  I  think
the report is somewhat lacking in substance and leads me to ask why  we  are
actually debating  the  report  today.  We  can't  blame  the  Joint  Budget
Committee, however, for the report and its lack  of  substance  of  which  I
accused it. Simply, the information we require at this stage to do the  type
of monitoring that is necessary is  just  not  available.  We  rely  on  the
information  that  comes  mostly  from  National  Treasury  and   Government
departments. And, as I would recall,  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
PFMA, would actually demand that, in due course, additional  information  be
forthcoming to Parliament and to the Joint Budget  Committee  -  information
that will enable us to do what we need to do. I think that some  information
largely relates to annual reporting necessary  for  both  management  within
the  departments  and  Government  institutions,   as   well   as   to   the
accountability oversight in which we are interested.

On the report, I think that there is not too  much  value  in  referring  to
trends which, firstly, are very general - trends of how much one  department
spends in total, as opposed to programmes. There is not  much  happening  in
comparing quarter by quarter or month by month of these very  general  gross
amounts. And, here we are comparing actual with actual because  this,  in  a
way, ignores any  cyclical  or  seasonal  spending  trends  in  departments.
Departments don't simply divide their budgets by 12 and spend in that  exact
pattern. The report ignores any service delivery plan, which  is  especially
true of the capital  expenditure  side.  It  ignores  any  other  manner  of
consideration that can arise in the reality of any department in its  budget
year. Of course, in total, the  figures  we  are  working  with  ignore  the
Budget almost altogether, when comparing actual with  actual.  As  a  Budget
committee, of course, in time it's  going  to  be  important  that  we  only
monitor and compare actual spending to budgeted spending  for  a  particular
period.

But, on the positive side, I think, as  other  speakers  have  pointed  out,
especially the chairperson, the committee is demonstrating a  sense  of  its
future role and continuing to define its mandate which would  make  it  more
and more useful to  Parliament  as  an  oversight  instrument  of  the  very
important areas of revenue and expenditure across Government.

I think that our challenge in the main, from our view, exists in two  areas.
And this takes us perhaps beyond the recommendations that are in  our  first
report, and indeed in our second report which came out last  week.  The  two
areas will, firstly, be how the Budget committee  ultimately  gets  involved
in the Budget-making process and, of course, these debates have gone on  for
many, many years between, I think,  initially  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Finance and the Ministry.

The key issue here is going to remain the powers that the Constitution  says
Parliament should have. And, in this case, I think we  shall  ultimately  go
to the Budget committee regarding the powers to amend money Bills  and  here
we are talking about the Budget. On one hand, we  can  be  quite  frustrated
that the National Treasury hasn't been  forthcoming  with  these  amendments
that made one aborted attempt some years back, as we might remember. But  we
still sit some five or six years after the adoption of our Constitution,  if
not longer, without these powers which we should have.

But one is not without sympathy for  the  Minister.  I  think  it's  a  very
difficult call for him to make as to how much intervention  he  feels  might
disrupt the very involved process which he undertakes every  year  with  all
sorts of departments and other bodies. I think it might  be  something  that
the Budget committee needs to look at regarding how we can be proactive  and
forthcoming on how we believe an amending money  Bill  could  be  framed  to
give us the type of powers that we want  and,  from  that  point,  take  the
initiative to engage with the Minister.

The second area is the one which we have  been  discussing  and  which  this
report covers: how we monitor the  Budget  and  how  it's  managed.  I  have
already referred to information which I'm sure was  intended  by  the  PFMA.
That really is information which should  originate  from  policy  and  which
should  get  interpreted  through  a  strategic   planning   exercise   that
incorporates timing for the delivery plan so that when we bring  our  Budget
into being, it must be costed and planned  month  by  month  against  what's
going to be delivered. We would then know that that's the  plan  and  that's
what we monitor against when we get the monthly  figures.  And,  of  course,
where there are differences and variations we would expect  the  departments
to automatically give us adequate explanations. I think that that would  add
a lot of purpose and usefulness to this exercise  which  we  have  attempted
because, after all, we can only monitor against that which has been  planned
and agreed to.

But, in conclusion, I do acknowledge that the committee has  done  the  best
they can, with the help of some able researchers and  with  the  information
to produce the report they have; and we certainly support it. Thank you.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN:  Chairperson,  the  First  Report  of  the  Joint  Budget
Committee before us today is significant, as the committee came  into  being
in October last year. Today we debate the  first  quarterly  report  on  the
departmental expenditure trends for January to March 2003. One of the  tasks
of the Joint Budget Committee is to monitor  on  a  regular  basis,  monthly
published actual revenue and expenditure per  department  and  to  ascertain
whether they are in line with Budget projections and  to  prepare  quarterly
reports.

The report before us provides us with a picture of the expenditure  patterns
of each Budget Vote. Whilst it is important for the Joint  Budget  Committee
to monitor figures, it is equally important to  look  beyond  these  figures
and  to  establish  whether  the  budgets  of  the  departments   are   used
effectively and  efficiently  to  implement  the  policies  of  the  ANC-led
Government.

Furthermore, to ensure that the Budget is positively impacting on the  lives
of the people of South Africa and that the frontiers of  poverty  are  being
pushed back,  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  and  the  respective  portfolio
committees need to work closely together to ensure that the  expenditure  of
line departments are in  line  with  the  measurable  objectives  which  are
indicated in the Estimates of National Expenditure.

Where necessary, visits should be undertaken to provinces to understand  the
successes  and  challenges  in  ensuring  that   expenditure   takes   place
efficiently and effectively. During the three-month period covered  by  this
report,  the  Department  of  Housing  continued  to  improve   the   living
conditions of South Africans. It continues to deliver new homes to those  in
our country who were both denied access to and the right to  own  their  own
homes under apartheid.

The Department of Housing has translated the Bill of Rights from words  into
action which has resulted in millions of people now being housed and  having
access to adequate housing. Whilst the housing delivery  programme  has  and
continues to improve the living standards of people throughout the  country,
we have to ensure that the homes that are delivered are of good quality  and
that they provide value for the money spent.

The Department of Housing has placed significant emphasis  on  the  delivery
of a quality product, together with quantity, rather than just  on  quantity
alone. The results of this are being seen as  the  quality  of  construction
and the final products  are  being  improved.  The  Portfolio  Committee  on
Housing has conducted oversight visits to all of the nine provinces and  one
of the concerns has been that some contractors build homes that  are  of  an
inferior quality.

To  eradicate  such  practices,  the  National  Home  Builders  Registration
Council has been given the responsibility of inspecting the construction  of
each house built. In instances  where  inferior  construction  methods  were
used, the contractor will be required to rectify this  before  hand-over  to
the beneficiary. The inspection of the  subsidy  homes  by  the  NHBRC  will
assist in ensuring the delivery of quality homes and  that  money  spent  is
well spent.

Through the housing  delivery  programme  millions  of  people  have  gained
access to running water, sanitation and electricity. To  service  these  new
communities, we have witnessed the building of new clinics, schools,  police
stations, courts, community centres and sport facilities to name but just  a
few. This is  a  clear  and  visible  indication  that  the  expenditure  of
Government is improving the lives of its citizens.

The Budget is playing an important role in the  realisation  of  the  social
rights which are espoused in the Bill of Rights.  Just  this  past  weekend,
while I was interacting with residents in Mohlakeng  on  the  West  Rand  in
Gauteng, each person I spoke  to,  without  hesitation,  stated  that  their
lives had positively changed since the ANC came to power in 1994.  They  all
acknowledged that significant progress  had  been  made  and  that  the  ANC
should continue with its work of transforming the country.

Throughout the country, roads are being  repaired  and  built.  Just  a  few
weeks ago, I travelled through the  former  Transkei  area  in  the  Eastern
Cape. The N2 highway is being resurfaced  and  rebuilt  in  parts.  The  Kei
Cuttings Pass is now a safe road for motorists. But what struck me most  was
that the last time I had driven through this area, back in  1989,  the  area
was in total darkness. Now the entire area has been transformed through  the
installation of electricity.

The 13 rural development and eight urban renewal nodes previously  announced
by Government are being provided  with  the  necessary  infrastructure  that
will facilitate the economic regeneration of these areas. In  Mount  Ayliff,
new roads are being constructed, transport  facilities  are  being  provided
and a goat-processing centre is under construction, which will provide much-
needed employment opportunities for the local communities.

In Alexandra, in Gauteng, the entire area is under reconstruction, with  new
housing, clinics, a new  police  station  and  new  infrastructure  such  as
roads, water and sanitation being provided and, where  necessary,  upgraded.
Again these are clear  and  visible  indications  that  the  expenditure  of
Government is impacting on society through the development of the rural  and
urban nodes.

The new port being built at Coega, the expansion of  our  airports  and  the
upgrading of railway stations, all form part of Government's  commitment  to
expand existing, and where necessary, invest in  new  infrastructure.  There
is no doubt that the  Budget  and  expenditure  thereof  are  attaining  the
desired  results  of  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  its   citizens,
stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty. In a short nine years  the
face of the country has been changed;  and  despite  the  significant  gains
made we still need  to  do  more.  It  is,  therefore,  imperative  that  we
continue to monitor and improve the expenditure of Budget allocations.

The role of the Joint Budget Committee and that of portfolio  committees  is
to  ensure  that  this  continues  to  take  place  -  to  hold  departments
accountable for what  they  spend  and  deliver,  and  to  ensure  that  the
priorities and policies of Government are implemented.

In conclusion, I would like to urge all South Africans to renew the  mandate
that they gave to the ANC in 1994 and in 1999. Next year we, as  a  country,
have a choice to make. Either we can choose to undo the gains that  we  have
made over the past nine years - and a vote for the DA will do  just  that  -
or we can choose to continue along the road  of  transforming  our  country,
improving the lives of all the people of South Africa, stimulating  economic
growth, reducing poverty, and creating a country we can be proud of. A  vote
for the ANC will ensure that this continues to happen.

I would also like to urge those South Africans who  are  being  confused  by
the noises and sabre-rattling of the  DA  to  join  the  millions  of  South
Africans next year who will place  their  mark  next  to  that  of  the  ANC
because they believe in and want a Government that cares for them, and  that
delivers on its promises. I thank you.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Geagte Voorsitter, ek verwys na die  kritiek  wat  die  agb
Wikus Theron gerig het tot die Departement van  Openbare  Ondernemings,  dat
hulle in een maand geweldige groot bedrae bestee het. Ek wil graag  vir  hom
daarop wys dat dié departement 'n klein departement is en  eintlik  maar  'n
tussenganger is om die geld te ontvang wat  deur  middel  van  privatisering
verkry word. Daardie geld word dan in een groot  bedrag  oorbetaal  aan  die
fiskus. En ek dink die bedrag waarna hy verwys, is die bedrag wat  deur  die
notering van Telkom op die aandelebeurs  verkry  is  en  toe  in  'n  enkele
bedrag oorbetaal is aan die fiskus om elders aangewend  te  word.  Soos  ek,
dink ek hy moet ook maar 'n bietjie versigtig wees dat  ons  nie  te  vinnig
kritiseer voor ons nie seker is  waarvan  ons  praat  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Chairperson, I refer to the criticism  the  hon  Wikus
Theron directed at the Department of Public Works, that they spent  enormous
amounts in one month. I would like to point out to him that this  department
is a small one and is  only  a  go-between  which  receives  money  obtained
through privatisation. That money is then transferred in one big  amount  to
the Treasury. And I think the amount he referred to was the amount  obtained
through the listing  of  Telkom  on  the  stock  exchange,  which  was  then
transferred in a single amount to the Treasury to be  used  elsewhere.  Like
me, I think he should be careful not to criticise too quickly before we  are
are certain of what we are talking about.]

Chairperson, seeing that this debate is the first of the proceedings of  the
Joint  Budget  Committee,  one  can  expect  that  it   will   be   somewhat
philosophical in nature. That is exactly  what  has  happened  so  far.  The
committee was set up with the aim of involving Parliament  more  closely  in
the budgeting process.

The Bill leading to the formation  of  this  committee  states  specifically
that the JBC itself should make proposals regarding the  process  Parliament
should follow with regard to its role in developing  budgets  in  accordance
with constitutional requirements.

The primary task of the JBC is  to  consider  proposed  allocations  in  the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, as well as  the  Appropriation  Bill  and
whether these allocations are broadly in keeping with the policy  directions
of Government, and to conduct hearings on the document issued in  connection
with. It should also, on a regular basis, monitor monthly, published  actual
revenue and expenditure per department and per province.

The formation of this committee  enables  Parliament  to  intervene  in  the
Budget but not to duplicate or try to take over the role of  the  executive.
The JBC is a joint committee consisting of  members  of  both  the  National
Assembly and the National  Council  Of  Provinces.  The  role  of  the  NCOP
component in the JBC is to represent the unique interests of  the  provinces
and not to mirror or duplicate the National Assembly process.

The finding of this First Report of the JBC,  mainly  that  the  Free  State
province is a serious and consistent underspender on both  its  capital  and
current budgets, points in the direction of a lack of capacity  within  this
province. It is the task of the NCOP component of the JBC to deal with  this
problem.

The JBC should also be careful  not  to  try  to  hijack  the  role  of  the
portfolio committees  or  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts.  A
finding in one  of  the  first  draft  reports  of  the  JBC,  namely,  that
Statistics SA neither budgeted for conducting the October  Household  Survey
for 2002, which was  needed  by  Government,  nor  for  obtaining  mortality
statistics required by the President points to sloppy  financial  management
within this department.

The issue was dealt with in the correct way. The JBC raised  the  alarm  but
did not try to take over the task of Scopa,  which  is  to  watchdog  public
accounts. When Scopa finalises its report  on  the  investigation  into  the
financial management of Stats SA, the report should not  be  dealt  with  by
the JBC but by the Portfolio Committee on Finance, which is responsible  for
overseeing Stats SA. So, the JBC is still finding its way in dealing with  a
more effective involvement of Parliament in the budgetary process.

I believe, however, that this committee will develop into one  of  the  most
important instruments of Parliament and will lead to  better  accountability
and more transparency in Government.  The  New  NP  therefore  supports  the
adoption of this referred First Report of the JBC. [Applause.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, as was indicated, at this stage, this report  deals
mainly with trends  and  expenditure  for  the  last  three  months  of  the
financial year. There is a  clear  distinction  between  the  role  of  this
committee and Scopa to the extent that one  looks  at  compliance,  and  the
other one is  supposed  to  look  at  performance  against  the  Budget  and
expenditure against plan.

There are concerns in the report which may or may  not  be  serious.  But  I
would like to say  that  I  fully  endorse  what  the  hon  Woods  has  said
regarding the physical  role  and  information  that  is  required  by  this
meeting to meaningfully report back to Parliament on that  process.  As  was
indicated, there may be a lack of capacity and I  think  Free  State  is  an
example regarding where it was indicated that there was an underspending  on
both current and capital expenditure.

Another aspect that came from this report is dumping,  and  that  may  be  a
serious problem. If we look at the expenditure pattern we  notice  that  one
department spent 50% of their budget in the last month,  another  spent  40%
and another one spent 30%. In total, 18 departments spent more than  10%  of
their budgets in the last month of the financial year. Surely,  that  raises
questions somewhere. And, regarding this, the committee needs  to  intervene
in time when it identifies problem areas  in  spending  patterns,  including
unnecessary spending. A closer co-operation  between  the  Budget  committee
and the portfolio committees  is  needed  in  such  instances.  A  cordially
combined sitting may possibly be an option.

The ACDP notes  the  contents  of  this  report  and  we  will  support  the
recommendations made herein. Thank you.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Chairperson and hon members, the tide has turned.  The  fact
that we are standing here discussing the first report of  the  JBC  and  the
fact that the hon member, Lowe, can come and object or make comments on  the
Budget is something that is new. For that matter, it  shows  that  the  tide
has turned.  We  are  not  prepared  to  hide  anything,  as  the  ANC.  The
establishment of the JBC, which is in accordance with the  Constitution,  is
a clear indication that we have to  monitor  the  departments.  We  have  to
ensure that their expenditure is in accordance with what  they  indicate  in
the narratives, and that there are  measurables  and  aims  with  regard  to
their programmes.

Although we support and are ready to go according to section 77(2), we  have
to manage this process from the onset very,  very  carefully  because  there
are quite a number of things which have been mentioned by the Financial  and
Fiscal Commission,  and  the  SA  Human  Rights  Commission  which  indicate
certain things with regard to the delivery of certain departments.

I am going to concentrate on the social services cluster. According  to  the
report, different departments fall into  two  categories:  departments  with
the lowest expenditure and those with the  highest  expenditure.  There  are
quite a number of reasons which may be advanced for this. But before I  come
to those reasons which have been reflected in  these  different  reports  by
the Human Rights Commission and  the  Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission,  I
would like to send a message to the  departments  to  pull  up  their  socks
because we are still going to hold public hearings and  interact  with  them
to find out what has led to the irregularities depicted in the  report.  The
other appeal that I would like to make  is  to  portfolio  committees.  They
need to ensure that they interact  with  the  line-function  departments  in
order to determine what could have led to this. Please, look at  the  report
and interact with your departments  so  that  we  can,  together,  gradually
ensure that departments stick to their aims,  and  that  if  there  are  any
challenges those challenges can be addressed.

I want to look at the issue of Social Development and Health.  I  will  just
refer to certain departments. According to the report, we find  that  Social
Development, Health and Education are classified as those  departments  that
have the highest expenditures. One wonders what could have led to that -  as
the hon members have referred to the expenditure  reflected  in  the  report
for January, February and March this year, that is the final quarter of  the
previous financial year.

The expenditures are high but when we  look  at  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission's report we find that they mention the  issue  of  constitutional
responsibility  and  concurrent  responsibilities  from  the  national   and
provincial levels. The issue could be that the departments  are  faced  with
transfers to provinces. Therefore, those transfers, perhaps,  could  be  the
issue. In any case, I don't want to pre-empt what the departments would  say
in accounting for that. But those  are  issues  that  the  different  social
services departments are faced with because the minute the money  goes  into
their accounts it has to be transferred  to  provinces  that  could  be  one
thing that is responsible for that. However, we have to establish the  facts
regarding that.

The other thing that I would like to mention  concerns  section  32  of  the
Public Finance Management Act which emphasises  that  the  departments  must
look at deviations from the actual expenditure. That  issue  was  raised  by
hon Schneeman  regarding  the  fact  that  we  cannot  concentrate  only  on
expenditure, but that we need  to  look  at  qualitative  expenditure.  What
impact does the expenditure have on  communities?  The  report,  as  it  is,
indicates figures only. It doesn't clearly show what has been the impact  of
the expenses on the ground. So those are some of the challenges with  regard
to the social cluster.

The departments in the social  cluster  deal  with  very  sensitive  issues.
These are the departments that directly impact on issues of poverty. So,  we
find that these issues  have  to  be  looked  at  when  we  look  at  Social
Development and Health. They have a direct impact on the issues of  poverty.
Those issues have to be looked into. But, we cannot  say  that  we  are  not
doing very well. As the ANC, we are going to claim  the  successes  that  we
have made with regard to the issue that I have already raised, that of  just
being able to discuss the Budget.

The other thing that I would like to look at is  the  issue  that  is  being
raised in this report regarding the availability of data. It was only  after
the passing of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act  that  the  departments
started to compile data in order to be able to plan properly. So  these  are
some of the  things  which,  perhaps,  need  to  be  looked  into.  We  must
concentrate on the qualitative aspects while we  address  these  issues.  We
must therefore, make sure that we don't only concentrate on  the  amount  of
money spent, but on the qualitative aspects of that spending.

The other thing that I would like to  address,  which  is  peculiar  to  the
social cluster, is the issue of the developmental principle which  is  built
into it. This also brings us to the qualitative side of  things.  There  are
challenges which the social cluster faces because the issue  of  development
requires  longer  planning  instead  of  just  passing  the  money  to   the
respective  recipients.  They  have  to  plan.  Regarding   the   issue   of
developmental aspects which have been mentioned in several ... I think  that
one of such examples  even  appeared  in  the  education  Bill.  It  is  the
planning which precedes the implementation which  might  delay  issues.  So,
once processes have been planned it is easier  to  transfer  money  for  the
implementation at the end of the year. Those are the issues that we need  to
consider when we assess, as the JBC; we cannot just say that things are  not
going right.
The issue of development is something that never existed.  It  is  something
that has just been introduced. People can just concentrate on  figures.  Our
duty is not to concentrate on figures but to look at that. The other  thing,
with regard to the Public Finance  Management  Act,  is  we  find  that  the
measurable objectives have not  been  part  of  the  strategic  planning  in
budgeting. That will only apply in the next Budget, which means the  2003-04
Budget, so we find that the report is  not  able  to  reflect  those  issues
because they were not supposed to be part of the  strategic  planning,  with
regard to budgeting. So those are  some  of  the  things  that  we  need  to
consider when we appraise this report.

The other thing that I would like to raise is that we  should  look  at  the
significance of the Budget, as hon Comrade Schneeman has indicated. We  find
that these departments, which are in the social cluster that I am trying  to
appraise here, are the ones that are very  significant  in  connection  with
the issues that I have raised with regard to pushing back the  frontiers  of
poverty. And, we want to emphasise that, in pushing back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, we are fighting for poverty alleviation.  But  poverty  alleviation
is not an end in  itself.  Because  of  that  developmental  principle,  the
paradigm shift, it is a means to an end - and the end  is  the  creation  of
wealth. Thank you. We support the adoption of this report. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Chairperson and hon members,  Parliament  serves  as
the custodian of national assets,  and  to  this  effect  the  Joint  Budget
Committee, over and above  the  portfolio  committees  and  Scopa,  monitors
expenditure   patterns    of    national    departments    and    provincial
administrations.

Fluctuations in spending persist in almost all departments. In an effort  to
utilise  approved  budgets  within  the  fiscal  year,  spending   in   some
departments surges from January to March. Such fluctuations bring  to  light
that capacity in financial  management  procedures  is  still  wanting  and,
invariably, compliance with the Public Finance Management  Act  of  1999  is
compromised.

Expenditure patterns of the Department of Communications leave  much  to  be
desired as this department was still  left  with  54,2%  of  its  budget  by
January 2003. The mind boggles at how they would spend the amount  in  three
months when they could not do so in nine months. This  is  in  the  face  of
some areas in the republic not yet receiving television signals.

A  host  of  other  departments  that  keep  lamenting  their   low   budget
allocations have also not been able to attain the national  average  balance
of  10,3%  at  the  time  of  the  fiscal  year.  Among  these  are   Social
Development, Home Affairs as well as Health, and all these departments  have
to deal with people's lives from the cradle to the grave. Surely  there  has
to be improvement in the utilisation of allocated  funds  to  justify  calls
for more funds and avoid roll-overs.

Accounting officers have to learn that overspending is  not  a  good  fiscal
conduct. Four departments exceeded their allocations as at the end of  March
2003.  These  are  Samdi,  Public  Works,  Statistics  SA  and  Correctional
Services. We hope that these departments will take a  leaf  from  Parliament
and the Department of Safety and Security on how to run their budgets.

While provincial  administrations  are  trying  to  control  their  spending
patterns, five provinces overspent their budgets, with Free State,  Limpopo,
Mpumalanga and Western Cape underspending theirs.  It  is,  however,  better
that way, considering that in the past it was a general trend. Finally,  the
UCDP supports the recommendations of the Joint Budget Committee. Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Before  expressing  its  views  on
the report, the MF would first like to take this opportunity  to  thank  the
committee for its efficient work. Having read the report as printed  on  the
ATC of 18 June 2003, the MF voices no objection to the  recommendation  that
further capacity be built into financial management procedures. The  highest
degree of efficiency and effectiveness has to  be  maintained.  It  is  felt
that such capacity would benefit this process.
The scrutinisation of departments' strategic plans  prior  to  embarking  on
new projects, to prevent overspending, is strongly supported by  the  MF  as
such information would assist in planning and budgeting effectively.  It  is
hoped that role-players will be proactive  in  ensuring  that  they  benefit
from these recommendations.

The need for transparency is very strong  in  our  democracy,  in  order  to
assure  our  people  of  the  efficiency  of  this  Government.   Thus   the
recommendation that overspending and underspending be made  open  in  public
hearings and in Parliament is supported.

Further,  the  suggestion  that  we  should  facilitate  a   close   working
relationship between the Joint Budget Committee and sector committees  would
benefit  nation-building.  The  recommendations  made  with  regard  to  the
provincial government are adequate. It is hoped that these would be  adopted
nationally.

The suggestion to embark on  a  study  tour  is  supported,  since  it  will
provide us with an opportunity to take a closer look at the real  situation.
The  recommendation  for  time  management  regarding  reports,   continuous
technical and research support, as well as the prioritisation  of  capacity-
building in financial oversight is found to be necessary and  is  supported.
The MF notes the recommendations made  by  this  committee  and  voices  its
support for such measures. Thank you, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Good afternoon, Deputy Chairman  and  colleagues.  The  hon  Dr
Pierre Rabie  could  unfortunately  not  be  here  this  afternoon.  He  has
prepared a speech, which I've agreed to read on his behalf. So,  perhaps  to
my friends in the ANC, I'm sorry if I'm going  to  disappoint  you,  but  it
might be rather slow into the afternoon.

Nevertheless, may I just report that the First Report of  the  Joint  Budget
Committee must be seen in the light of the Government using the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework as a budgeting  tool.  The  MTEF  is,  in  essence,  a
budgeting mechanism which  can  be  divided  into  a  number  of  Government
programmes. Of these, two important legislative measures instituted  by  the
National Treasury include, firstly, the Division of Revenue  Act,  which  is
passed every financial year as part of the  budget  allocation  process.  It
determines  equitable  division  of  revenue  between  the  two  spheres  of
Government and the horizontal  division  amongst  provinces;  secondly,  the
Appropriation Act, which provides for the appropriation  of  money  for  the
National Revenue Fund for the executive's  requirement  in  respect  of  the
relevant financial year.

My presentation will  concentrate  on  the  national  Government's  revenue.
Expenditure in national borrowing for the fourth quarter ending  March  2003
shows that expenditure credits for  the  first  quarter  of  2003  showed  a
gradual increase  from  January  to  March  2003.  The  report  states  that
Government Communications and Information Systems was still  left  with  50%
of its budget unspent. In March of 2003  the  department  managed  to  spend
49,72% of the remaining funds in its budget.

This debate refers only to the first report,  and  an  important  aspect  to
notice is that the figures presented to  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  were
unaudited, which may change after the auditing process has been completed.

The monthly expenditure  trends  of  national  departments  for  the  months
January to March 2003 show that the average departmental  expenditure  as  a
percentage of the Budget Vote was 8,38%, with 20 departments  spending  less
than this average. The report states that Public Service and  Administration
consistently spends a small percentage of less than 6% of their budget  each
month. Of most concern is that this  department  spent  only  3,91%  of  its
budget in October, November and December 2002, and only 3,97% of its  budget
in January 2003.

The report also states that the Department of Education was left  with  less
than 4% of its budget by January 2003. The actual  monthly  expenditure  for
January was 0,85% of its  budget.  The  question  was  asked  whether  0,85%
expenditure of the total budget was a realistic figure for the same period.

The departmental expenditure trends for February  2003  indicated  that  the
average expenditure of departments constituted 7,44% of their total  budget.
The communications department was left with 50% of its budget by the end  of
February 2002-03.

Departmental expenditure trends for March 2003 indicated  that  the  average
amounts spent by national departments for the  month  of  March  constituted
9,3% of the budget. The lowest departmental  total  budget  expenditure  for
March 2002-03 was recorded  in  Public  Enterprises.  Trade  and  Industry's
March expenditure was 15,71%. Its total percentage spent was 92%, leaving  a
balance of 7,67%.

The four highest departmental expenditures by the end of March 2002-03  were
recorded in the SA Management  Development  Institute,  then  Public  Works,
Statistics SA and Correctional  Services.  The  expenditure  percentages  of
their  budgets  amounted   to   107,5%;   104,09%;   101,69%   and   100,36%
respectively.

The DA believes that it is vital that the Joint  Budget  Committee  and  the
heads  of  departments  meet  on  a   regular   basis   to   deliberate   on
overexpenditure and underexpenditure  in  Government  departments.  I  thank
you.

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Deputy Chair, hon members, let me  thank  you  for  taking
your time to come and listen to me. There is a lesson that a lot of  us  can
learn from nature. If one were to observe a flock of geese, one  would  find
that when it is winter they fly away from a dry  place  to  where  there  is
water. They fly in a V-shape fashion and one goose leads  the  whole  flock.
When that goose gets tired, it simply  moves  back  and  another  one  comes
forward and they continue to fly. They fly in tandem and in support of  each
other, and that is precisely the way the ANC  operates  outside  and  inside
Government.

When we deal with budget issues, we deal with  issues  in  so  far  as  they
relate to performance against the Budget.  Now,  if  you  cannot  hear,  and
start going through  numbers  and  percentages  and  so  forth,  we  end  up
confused ourselves. That was the point regarding the last speaker.  He  told
us that the points that he raised related to figures that were not  audited.
Therefore, that presuggests that they cannot be taken as  facts.  There  are
other underlying situations involved there. Once you get an audited  report,
you will then be able to say,  ``I  put  the  blame  at  the  door  of  this
department''. But before you get that, you cannot do it.

Let me illustrate that. If you look at the report, you will realise that  it
would appear that the Department of Education has overspent.  It  has  spent
more that 50% of its budget and there is only one explanation  why  that  is
the case. The explanation is very simple:  At  the  beginning  of  each  and
every financial year the Department of Education is  involved  in  transfers
to institutions of higher learning,  and  those  are  huge  transfers.  Now,
regarding those numbers, you have already  said,  ``These  ones  will  never
spend their  money  well  and  they  are  overspending'',  without  actually
looking at what is involved.

Let us move to another point. For your  information,  hon  members,  I  have
known hon Theron since he was still a councillor who represented the  FF  in
the city council of Pretoria. I was shocked to find him in the DA.  But,  be
that as it may, let us deal with the issues today. He said that it is  wrong
for a department to spend 89% of its allocation. Let  me  just  inform  him:
It's acceptable, universally so, to spend up to 67% of  your  budget.  There
is no crime in spending 89%. You  want  people  to  be  involved  in  fiscal
dumping and once they are left with 11% just spend  it  anyhow.  We  do  not
operate in that way.

However, let us look  at  what  this  Government  has  done.  Regarding  the
community-based public works programme,  this  is  one  programme  that  has
benefited the  poorest  of  the  poor  communities  through  meaningful  job
creation which has created community assets and  infrastructure  in  a  more
sustainable fashion.  The  other  day,  just  two  months  back,  I  had  an
opportunity to go to a small town in Free State called Theunissen. The  last
time I went to Theunissen was in 2001. When I went there again,  in  2003  -
those who know Theunissen will be shocked by what I went  through  -  I  got
lost. Why I got lost is because there was so much development that  I  could
not find the  route  that  I  had  used  the  last  time.  [Applause.]  This
Government has not stopped at  that.  It  has  moved  forward  and  actually
engaged in an expanded public works programme.

Every now and then we get told how we are not delivering,  and  how  we  are
not changing our people's lives. Let us look at the points and look  at  the
facts. In terms of the promotion of small, medium and micro  enterprises  we
all know that the rate at which SMMEs are  born  compared  to  the  rate  at
which they die is so insignificant minimal that it is almost equal. That  is
a fact; but look at what this Government has done. Just  recently,  no  less
than R40 million was spent in promoting small, medium  and  microenterprises
in the construction area of the Coega development. That  is  good.  That  is
why we have  to  support  this  Government.  Further,  this  Government  has
ensured that, in a very short  space  of  time,  2  500  families  have  the
pleasure of taking a key and opening a door of a house  and  saying,  ``This
is my house. This is my house''. [Applause.] These are facts.

It is only through disciplined monetary policy that we will  see  fruits  of
our government. Regarding the interest rate  cuts,  when  you  cut  interest
rates there is a disposable income.  When  there  is  a  disposable  income,
there is an increase in savings. When there is an increase  in  savings,  an
individual is prepared for the hard times. And  it's  only  this  Government
that makes sure that these things happen.

However, there are other things that we need to look at. We need to look  at
how our banking systems are. There are flaws in the banking system.  So,  in
this flock of geese that is flying, there are these  other  geese  somewhere
at the back who do not pull together with us. And we need to point out  that
the banks are letting us down. We need to find a way of  ensuring  that  the
banks look at the interest of  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  How  does  that
happen? The money of a person who makes smaller deposits will earn  a  small
interest. Surely, we need to look  at  it  the  other  way  round.  We  must
encourage our people to save. Once they save,  our  economy  will  grow  and
poverty will be alleviated. Maybe, I say maybe,  our  Minister,  hon  Trevor
Manuel, should regulate that certain portions of  the  hard-earned  interest
should be tax free. Then, once people know that they could save  on  tax  by
saving, they will be encouraged to save; I said, maybe.

Let us leave that one and look at how retailers behave. Where  there  is  an
interest cut on one side, we expect prices to  go  down.  Do  they  ever  go
down? They never go down, they remain there. We must find a way of  ensuring
that our Pick n' Pays, Trade Centres,  and  our  Shoprite/Checkers  actually
move in tandem and in support of the  flock  of  geese  that  is  flying  to
prosperity. I want to thank you all. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member.  This  time  it
was the geese and not the porcupine. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  move  that  the
report be adopted.

Question agreed to.

Report adopted.

The House adjourned at 18:04.
