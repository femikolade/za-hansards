 THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENTS IN ASSISTING MULTILATERAL ORGANISATIONS IN ENSURING
    PEACE AND SECURITY AND BUILDING AN INTERNATIONAL COALITION FOR PEACE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Deputy  Chair,  earlier  this  morning  I  had  an
opportunity to chair a session at the World Parks Congress  in  Durban.  One
of the objectives of this session was the need to  move  beyond  a  view  of
protected areas as isolated islands to a broader view of protected areas  as
essential contributors to regional development.

Minister Valli Moosa  and  other  Ministers  gave  input.  South  Africa,  a
country that was out in the dark because of apartheid, when the  last  world
congress was held in  Caracas,  Venezuela,  came  out  as  a  shining  star,
because we acknowledged that no country in isolation could bring changes  to
this world unless it ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order,  please.  Hon  members,
you are having a  multilateral  organisation  here.  We  are  talking  about
Parliament assisting multilateral organisations. Carry on, hon member.

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: I just  want  to  mention  that  whilst  you  were
calling members to order time did not stop.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, I will give you the few seconds.

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Thank you.  No  country  in  isolation  can  bring
changes to this world. They have to  work  with  others.  Our  transfrontier
parks  are  the  envy  of  many  countries.  This  debate  today  is   about
international networking. Through international conventions  and  protocols,
such as the World Heritage Convention, South Africa  managed  to  contribute
towards protected areas.

This topic today has been debated several times by  the  Inter-Parliamentary
Union. But because the IPU's discussions, declarations and  conclusions  are
not binding, some parliaments decided not to do a  thing  after  these  far-
reaching discussions. The IPU is a body of parliaments of the world.  It  is
a focal point for world dialogue, and it works for  peace  and  co-operation
among peoples, and for the firm establishment of representative democracy.

The questions of peace, security, strife and conflict were  brought  to  the
attention of the IPU several times. The union made  an  attempt  to  address
these issues. The IPU  reaffirmed  its  position  that  internal  conflicts,
especially in developing countries, could be averted. At  the  103rd  Inter-
Parliamentary Conference in Amman, Jordan, having noted the contribution  of
poverty to strife and conflict, the  IPU  called  for  the  cancellation  of
external  debt,  and  for  the  conversion  of  these  funds   into   social
development projects, along with the support  for  environmental  programmes
as part of sustainable development.

At the 104th conference in Jarkata, Indonesia, in its  resolution  regarding
financing for  development  and  a  new  paradigm  of  economic  and  social
development  designed  to  eradicate  poverty,  the  IPU  called  for   both
developed and developing countries to pursue  an  economic,  ecological  and
social development policy in the interest of human security.

At the 105th conference,  in  its  resolution  securing  observance  of  the
principles  of  international  law  in  the  interest  of  world  peace  and
security, the IPU urged all states to reduce the  difference  between  their
political, economic and social systems and co-operate with each  other  with
a view to maintaining international peace. That was in April  2001.  We  are
today discussing the same  topic,  because,  indeed,  peace  is  threatened.
These are some of the steps that the IPU has taken and continues to take.

It was at the 106th Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Ouagadougou, on  11
September 2001, where  143  parliaments  had  to  leave  Burkina-Faso  after
receiving news about the World Trade Centre in New York.  All  deliberations
had to come to an end because terror had hit the Twin Towers  of  New  York.
It was very clear that this incident would affect  all  the  delegates,  and
that, clearly, peace and security worldwide was still under threat.
It was a very sad day. The poor Burkinabe not only  extended  themselves  to
prepare to host this important conference, but they took  all  they  had  to
the  conference,  hoping  to  sell  their  products,  crafts  and  beautiful
clothes, but all that had to come to an end.

The IPU is committed to peace and security,  importantly  so,  in  order  to
build peace in strife-torn areas like our  continent.  In  the  Great  Lakes
region in Africa, the IPU is  continuously  engaging  parties  that  are  at
loggerheads, promoting democracy and helping in training parliamentarians.

Just two months ago, the IPU was present in Rwanda  to  encourage  women  to
stand for the 24 seats that are set aside for women.  They  also  encouraged
them to work together to put the scars of the genocide in the  past  and  to
rebuild their country. These are but a few examples of what the IPU, as  the
body of parliaments, does from time to time to forge  unity,  promote  peace
and support democratic parliaments.

When parliaments attended the IPU conference in  Chile,  it  coincided  with
the war on Iraq. The IPU agenda had to be altered to include an  item:  "The
need to put an urgent end to the war in Iraq and to re-establish peace;  the
role of the United Nations and the IPU." To quote from the preamble of  this
resolution, the IPU delegates said:


  (The IPU is) gravely concerned by the war in  Iraq,  a  sovereign  member
  state of the United Nations, and its consequences for peace and stability
  in the region ... expressing profound sorrow for the  victims  among  the
  civilian  population,  particularly  women,  children  and  the  elderly;
  recalling the purposes and  principles  of  the  Charter  of  the  United
  Nations and the primary responsibility of  the  United  Nations  Security
  Council under the Charter for the maintenance of international peace  and
  security; affirming its adherence to the principles  of  maintaining  the
  sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of Iraq; reaffirming  the
  right of the people of Iraq to determine their own political  future  and
  to control their own natural resources;  underlining  the  importance  of
  respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and  religious,  ethnic
  and cultural diversity in  the  territory  of  Iraq  at  all  times,  and
  stressing the urgent need  to  provide  humanitarian  assistance  to  the
  people of Iraq and welcoming United Nations Security  Council  Resolution
  1472 on the provision of humanitarian relief measures to  the  people  of
  Iraq throughout the country on an equitable basis.

There is  a  lot  we  can  do  as  parliaments  and  parliamentarians.  Many
countries  have  not  adopted  or  ratified  many   international   security
protocols. We can encourage them to do so in our deliberations.  I  have  an
example here. Even we, a progressive and  a  democratic  country,  have  not
acceded to the CEDAW protocol, a protocol that is very important  for  women
who are less fortunate than ourselves.

We know very well that our status as women will  never  change,  because  we
have a country where the central view or aim is to promote the  emancipation
of women. But there are women in Saudi Arabia who need  us  to  ratify  that
protocol to make their lives easier. Parliamentarians  and  parliaments  can
eliminate the causes of terrorism and conflict by focusing on promoting  and
ensuring  socioeconomic  development  and  racial,  ethnic,  religious   and
geographic equality.

In conclusion, one advantage of these discussions today, and many others  of
this nature, is that  we  as  South  African  parliamentarians  in  all  the
international  networks  ranging  from  the  UN,  the  AU,  SADC   and   the
Commonwealth will be able to speak in  one  voice,  because  most  of  these
forums discuss the same concerns and the same issues.

The importance of adhering to international conventions  and  protocols  can
help. The forum of presiding officers can also assist. The IPU  has  started
a forum where presiding officers meet at least twice a year.

Our parliaments are called  upon  to  take  a  balanced  approach  in  their
efforts, plans and  activities  in  co-operation  with  the  United  Nations
agencies and concerned organisations. Given  our  role  nationally,  on  the
continent and in the world, I have no doubt  that  even  today  this  debate
will continue to improve relations within states in order to fight  conflict
and instability at all times. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. You had  a  lot
of time still left over.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, on a point of order: I hope you won't  take  this
in any personal way, but I do note that you are in  fact  a  participant  in
this debate. This is not directed at the hon Mahlangu-Nkabinde. There  is  a
principle involved here. We accept  the  fact  that  this  is  a  relatively
uncontentious debate, but if you are a participant ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will not be participating.

Mr M J ELLIS: Your name is on the speakers' list.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, it  was  with  the  understanding
that if I were chairing, I would not be participating.

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, thank you very much for that.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, South Africa is not an  island.  South  Africa
is part of Africa and it is  part  of  the  world.  We  must  ask  ourselves
whether we are doing enough to  bring  about  a  world  that  values  peace,
freedom and human dignity. We must  protect  our  hard-fought  freedoms  and
accept that worldwide peace and security continue to be under threat.

The work of multilateral organisations to advance human rights and  freedoms
must go on and receive our support. We cannot turn our backs on the  horrors
of war. We must accept it as a responsibility to work  together  with  other
nations to prevent conflict and to bring about lasting peace. Many  existing
conflicts  could  be  resolved  through  multilateral  effort   and   global
commitment. This is particularly  urgent  at  the  humanitarian  level,  and
South Africa should consider how  best  we  can  assist  within  our  means,
particularly in Africa, and I stress "within our means".

There are also at least three categories of conflict where our resolve  will
continue to be  tested.  These  are  wars  between  states,  internal  armed
conflicts, and domestic and international terrorism. These cause  tremendous
human suffering, destroy families and communities, and  they  devalue  human
dignity.

These conflicts should not be ignored, neither should they be  tolerated  by
the world. Too often, the international organisations  fail  to  accept  the
responsibility  of  intervening.  What  must  be  remembered  is  that   the
experience of conflict today is not  solely  between  conflicting  soldiers;
civilians, men, women, children, the old, young and weak are vulnerable  and
easy targets.

On our own continent the child soldier has become a haunting  image  of  the
massive task we face, not just in securing peace, but in  creating  a  world
where everyone is respected and protected.

Peace and security are also under  threat  by  the  proliferation  of  small
arms, conventional weapons of  war  and  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  We
cannot be ambiguous about where our priorities lie  when  it  comes  to  the
trade, both legal and illegal, of weapons. South Africa must always  take  a
principled stand in this regard.

There are three areas where future threats to security can  be  averted  and
peace can  be  achieved:  firstly,  by  strengthening  democracy  worldwide;
secondly, by promoting fundamental human rights; and thirdly, by  supporting
peaceful settlement of conflict.

There can be no doubt that a democratic system  of  government  can  protect
against tyranny. But there is more to democracy than the basics of free  and
fair elections. We  do  democracy  a  great  disservice  if  we  ignore  our
responsibility to maintain its  value  by  not  allowing  regimes  that  act
undemocratically, or that  come  into  power  under  extremely  questionable
circumstances, to claim that they are democracies. We mustn't let  them  get
away with it. We must encourage the principle that governments must be  held
accountable, not only by their own populations,  but  by  the  community  of
nations. There can be, and there should be, no tolerance of  tyrants.  There
can be no support for countries that actively support  terrorist  groups  or
harbour criminals.

We face a serious security threat if we allow our goodwill and  openness  to
be abused. We must not fall into the category of  countries  whose  security
and infrastructure are weak and easily exploited by terror groups.

As parliamentarians, we have to remain vigilant of the  performance  of  our
security agencies. Our police, intelligence  and  defence  agencies,  acting
under the Constitution, must pursue policies that  ensure  the  security  of
our people. If the state fails in that task, pious  platitudes  about  world
peace mean less than nothing.
South Africa works for peace with multilateral organisations,  and  we  must
continue to do so, because peace and security is in our  national  interest.
But we cannot bear  the  cost  alone.  Organisations,  such  as  the  United
Nations, and also donor countries, need to recognise that  our  country  has
limited means and cannot afford the luxury of too  many  foreign  adventures
at the expense of our taxpayers.

The IPU, Inter-Parliamentary Union, is the international organisation  which
brings together the world's parliaments and  parliamentarians.  Its  mission
is to foster peace and  security  through  political  dialogue,  to  promote
democracy and respect for human rights and to contribute to the  development
of representative and effective legislative institutions. We  very  strongly
support the IPU.

What is needed from us  is  a  commitment  to  promoting  fundamental  human
rights for all and the protection  of  each  and  every  individual  in  the
knowledge that the individual human being is  the  touchstone  of  value.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs  I  MARS:  Deputy  Chair,  colleagues,  the  post-Cold-War  world  is  a
dangerous place, much more so than when two superpowers, the  United  States
of America and the Soviet Union, effectively cancelled each other  out.  The
restraints imposed on international actors  during  the  Cold  War  and  the
sobering effects of a potential nuclear holocaust are no longer in place.

Today's debate is not about whether the current unilateral agenda  is  right
or wrong. It is about building international peace  and  security,  and  the
fact  that  unilateral  action  has  undermined  and  weakened  multilateral
organisations, like the United Nations, which has dire consequences for  any
effort at building lasting worldwide peace and security.

Historically  and  traditionally,  the  role  of  parliament  has  been   to
represent  the  people  at  a  level  separate  from  a  national  or  state
government. Parliaments provide a forum for the expression of the view of  a
democratic country's people in both national and  international  issues.  It
is, therefore, an outlet for views that may not always be held or  expressed
publicly at national government level.

What role can parliaments play in assisting  multilateral  organisations  to
build international peace and security? Of course, they should  continue  to
play their traditional role  of  making  the  views  of  their  constituents
known, but in the case of global  peace  and  security,  parliaments  should
also go further by putting direct pressure on international actors that  are
not committed to multilateralism, by  putting  pressure  on  their  national
governments to advance the cause of multilateralism,  by  making  inputs  to
international  peace  and  security  initiatives,   and   by   strengthening
multilateral organisations through funding and active participation.

Building an international coalition for peace can only be  achieved  through
collective actions by the world's parliaments. It will be  a  daunting  task
as long as some  countries  believe  that  unilateral  action  represents  a
better and  easier  opportunity  for  the  achievement  of  national  policy
objectives.

The solution lies in strengthening multilateral organisations to  the  point
where they have real decision-making powers  and  real  teeth  to  implement
their decisions. If that could be achieved, the lone wolf states  will  have
sufficient reason and confidence to entrust the  achievement  of  their  own
national policy  objectives  to  international  multilateral  organisations.
World parliaments can help to make multilateral organisations stronger,  but
in addition to those actions  mentioned  above,  they  have  to  start  with
banishing the widely-held view that  multilateral  organisations,  like  the
United  Nations,  are  only  so-called   talk   shops   where   obfuscation,
obstructionism and a lack of creative ideas and  decisive  actions  are  the
order of the day.

That will not be an easy task, but, if it could be  accomplished,  it  would
mean that some states will come around to the view that it is better  to  be
inside the tent than outside it, to paraphrase a former American  president.
I thank you.

Ms F HAJAIG: Deputy Chairperson, colleagues and comrades,  even  before  the
attacks of  September  11,  2001,  the  international  community  faced  the
historic challenge of mounting a collective effort to achieve security in  a
world  scarred  by  atrocities  and  conflicts.  To  meet   the   challenge,
parliaments will have to recognise that security and  justice  are  mutually
reinforcing goals that ultimately depend on the promotion of  human  rights,
equality and social justice for all their people.

The principles established in the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights
demand accountability of those who  violate  these  fundamental  principles.
These principles are not the exclusive preserve of one  country  or  people,
but the shared birthright of the whole world.

Parliaments need to take the lead in their countries and internationally  by
strengthening  their  criminal  justice  systems  and   taking   responsible
measures  to  fight  terrorism  and  its  effects.  However,  success   will
ultimately lie in their ability to deal with the  causes  of  terrorism  and
other  conflicts.  Parliaments  need  to  do  more  to  expand  and   deepen
democracy, to eliminate poverty, racism, prejudice and  oppression,  and  to
bring about a more equitable, just and compassionate world.

Without this kind of comprehensive political, social and security  approach,
the world may find  it  more  difficult  to  fight  terrorism  and   address
conflicts - be they state to state,  interstate  or  intrastate  -   or  the
occupation of sovereign  states.  The  United  Nations  is  still  the  most
uniquely placed organisation which can provide a legal and  moral  framework
for collective international action  against  terrorism  and  all  forms  of
conflict.

Security requires a  comprehensive  strategy  that  seeks  to  address  root
causes. Violent conflict is best  prevented,  according  to  the  Secretary-
General of the United Nations, Mr Kofi Annan,  by  creating  capable  states
with representative governance based on  the  rule  of  law,  by  widespread
recognition that armed conflicts cannot be understood without  reference  to
such root causes as poverty, political repression  and  uneven  distribution
of resources.

He continues: "Every step  taken  towards  reducing  poverty  and  achieving
broad-based economic growth is  a  step  towards  conflict  prevention.  ...
Ignoring these underlying factors amounts to addressing the symptoms  rather
than the causes of deadly conflict."

I shall endeavour to speak on the impact of  armed  conflict  on  women  and
girls; the disproportionate targeting of women and children in  contemporary
armed conflicts; the fact that women and children  constitute  the  majority
of all victims of conflict, and the majority of  the  world's  refugees  and
internally displaced persons; their vulnerability  during  conflict  to  all
forms of violence, in particular sexual violence and exploitation  including
torture, rape, mass rape, forced  pregnancies,  sexual  slavery  and  forced
prostitution and trafficking; the political  and  symbolic  significance  of
such acts; the increase in the  risk  of  interpersonal  violence  including
domestic violence as a result  of  the  proliferation  of  small  arms;  the
incalculable consequences of such violence on physical  and  mental  health;
the increased threat of contracting  sexually  transmitted  infections;  and
systematic gender-based discrimination, which  reduces  their  potential  to
protect themselves from such infections.

The loss of males in armed conflicts increases the responsibility  of  women
and girls for family security, and the provision of food and shelter.  Thus,
the impact of conflict on women and girls calls for specific responses  from
the international community. One such response is Resolution  1325  of  2000
of the Security Council of the United Nations. Among  its  various  clauses,
it reaffirms the important role of women in the  prevention  and  resolution
of conflicts and in peace-building; and it stresses the importance of  their
equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the  maintenance
and promotion of peace and security, as well as the need to  increase  their
role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution.

This  resolution  affirms  the  need  to   implement   fully   international
humanitarian law and human rights law that protect the rights of  women  and
girls  during  and  after  conflicts.  It  recognises  the  urgent  need  to
mainstream a gender perspective in all peacekeeping operations according  to
the  Windhoek  Declaration  of  2000.  It  urges  member  states  to  ensure
increased  representation  of  women  at  all  decision-making   levels   in
national, regional and international institutions  and  mechanisms  for  the
prevention, management and resolution of conflict.

It further calls upon all parties to armed  conflict  to  have  respect  for
international law applicable to the  rights  and  protection  of  women  and
girls, especially as civilians, in particular the obligations applicable  to
them under various protocols; and especially to bear in  mind  the  relevant
positions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The  Rome
Statute will  play  a  crucial  role  in  securing  the  observance  of  the
principles of  international  law  in  the  interests  of  world  peace  and
security by providing a forum to investigate and prosecute, when a state  is
genuinely unable or unwilling to do so, the commission of the  worst  crimes
of international concern, namely, genocide, crimes against humanity and  war
crimes.

As you will recall, the United States of America refuses to  accede  to  the
Rome Statute that established the International  Criminal  Court.  What  are
they afraid of? The Rome  Statute  further  defines  rape,  sexual  slavery,
enforced prostitution, enforced sterilisation  and  other  forms  of  sexual
violence both as war crimes and, when committed as part of a  widespread  or
systematic attack  directed  against  any  civilian  population,  as  crimes
against humanity. It is imperative that all states accede to this  protocol.
Similarly, it is important that all  states,  including  America,  sign  and
ratify the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
Coming to our continent, I will mention the African  Charter  on  Human  and
Peoples' Rights, and the further Protocol on the Rights of Women in  Africa.
In 1997 the SADC heads  of  state  signed  the  Declaration  on  Gender  and
Development, and, in  1998  the  addendum:  Prevention  and  Eradication  of
Violence Against Women and Children.

In July 2002 the Peace and Security Council of the  African  Union  will  be
the standing decision-making organ for  the  prevention  and  resolution  of
conflicts. The objectives of the Peace and Security Council are  to  promote
peace,  security  and  stability  in  Africa  in  order  to  guarantee   the
protection and preservation of life  and  property,  the  wellbeing  of  the
African people and their environment, as well as the creation of  conditions
conducive to sustainable development; to anticipate and  prevent  conflicts;
to promote and implement  peace-building  and  postconflict  reconstruction,
rehabilitation  and  reintegration  activities  to  consolidate  peace   and
prevent the resurgence of violence; to develop a common defence policy;  and
to promote and encourage democratic practices and governance of the rule  of
law.

In Africa we have seen horrendous wars, and we have also  seen  progress  in
the resolution of conflicts. The democratic elections in Rwanda can only  be
seen as a success after the genocidal war. Burundi is making  progress;  the
DRC is on the road to stabilisation; Sierra Leone seeks  peace;  Liberia  is
trying to sort out its problems and  so  are  Sudan,  Somalia,  Eritrea  and
Ethiopia.

What kind of role can a Pan-African Parliament play in promoting  peace  and
security? A direct and clear role for the  Pan-African  Parliament  has  not
been defined in the protocol on peace  and  security  of  the  AU.  However,
regional mechanisms and the Peace and Security  Council  are  answerable  to
the commissions of the AU, albeit indirectly to the Pan-African  Parliament.
Article 3 enjoins the chairpersons of the commission to present to the  Pan-
African Parliament an annual report on the state of peace  and  security  on
the continent, and also  to  take  all  steps  required  to  facilitate  the
exercise by the parliament of its powers in so far  as  it  relates  to  the
objectives of promoting security and stability.

 Despite the limitation placed on the  powers  and  functions  of  the  Pan-
African  Parliament,  Article  11  enables  the  Pan-African  Parliament  to
promote peace on the continent. In its capacity  as  the  representative  of
all African people, it will be in a  better  position  to  make  a  positive
impact on influencing national parliamentary programmes by  holding  debates
on peace, security, gender equity,  economic  development,  good  governance
and poverty eradication.

The decision-making at all levels is  dependent  on  governments  and  other
organs of  civil  society  mainstreaming  a  gender  perspective  in  policy
development and the implementation  of  programmes.  Equality  in  decision-
making  is  essential  to  the  empowerment  of  women.  Therefore,  it   is
imperative that the role of African women in decision-making should  be  one
which strives towards building a critical mass within Africa  to  shape  the
continent's future. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I fully agree  with  the  previous  speaker.
With the possible exceptions of Joan of Arc and Winnie  Mandela,  women  are
born peacemakers and indeed they can play an  important  role  in  promoting
peace on the continent.

According to The Economist of 24 May 2003, a certain region in the  DRC  has
been engaged in fighting for nearly 40 years. Rubaruba Zabuloni, a  dwarfish
69-year-old with a crew cut and a black fur hat, leads a 7  000-man  militia
in the hills above Lake Tanganyika. In the 1960s  he  fought  alongside  Che
Guevara. In later years the Soviet Union continued to supply him with  arms,
but up to this very day he is totally unaware of the demise of  either  and,
like the DA, he keeps on fighting back.

This region is a typical example of what is happening in many parts  of  the
African continent. The war in the Sudan, for example, started  in  1955  and
now, after 48 years, the end is still not in sight. Another  startling  fact
is that the poorest one  sixth  of  humanity  endures  four  fifths  of  the
world's civil wars  with  devastating  consequences.  A  typical  civil  war
leaves a country 15% poorer than what it would  have  been  otherwise,  with
perhaps 30% more people living in absolute poverty.

It is an understatement to say that this carnage on the  continent  must  be
stopped. Multilateral organisations can and must play an important  role  in
this regard. Unfortunately, the UN does not live up to expectations. In  the
DRC, for example, the UN can barely raise half its mandated complement of  8
000 peacekeepers and spends  almost  half  of  its  annual  budget  of  $600
million just flying over the Congo's vast roadless forests.

Earlier this year in Bunia, in the DRC, 700 UN peacekeepers were  unable  to
prevent a massacre outside their barracks  because  their  mandate  was  too
feeble. A Congolese civilian was quoted as follows: "While  the  rebels  are
killing us, the UN takes  notes  and  makes  reports."  No  wonder  Uganda's
president Mr Museveni labelled the UN peacekeepers  as  dangerous  tourists.
This poor state of affairs can only be rectified when  parliaments  persuade
their governments to support UN resolutions which empower the UN  adequately
to fulfil its mandate.

The AU and the different regional organisations can and must play a role  in
ensuring peace and stability on the continent. The protocol relating to  the
establishment of the Peace and Security Council of  the  AU  merits  special
mention in this regard. An African Security Council and an African  stand-by
force, as envisaged in the protocol, will play a crucial  role  in  bringing
peace and security to the  continent.  Unfortunately,  the  protocol  cannot
enter into force because less than half of  the  member  states  of  the  AU
have,  to  date,  ratified  it.  Again,  parliaments  can  play  a  role  in
persuading them to do just  that.  An  African  reaction  force  could  have
prevented the massacres in Burundi, in Rwanda, and  in  Bunia,  to  which  I
referred earlier.

Streeksorganisasies,  soos  byvoorbeeld  die  SAOG,  kan  en  moet  ook   'n
deurslaggewende rol speel om veiligheid en sekuriteit te  bevorder.  In  dié
opsig het Ecowas 'n lofwaardige voorbeeld gestel deur stabiliteit  te  bring
in Sierra Leone. Weer eens, die SAOG Protokol  vir  Politieke,  Verdediging-
en Veiligheidsamewerking het die vermoë om, veral in die DRK, die  vrede  te
bewerkstellig, maar geen enkele land van die SAOG, ook nie Suid-Afrika,  het
hierdie protokol bekragtig nie. Ook hier kan  dié  Parlement  'n  belangrike
rol speel om die leiding in die verband te  neem,  en  ek  vertrou  dat  die
Parlement so gou as moontlik hierdie protokol sal bekragtig,  want  dit  bly
die enigste manier om multilaterale organisasies te  help  om  konflikte  op
die kontinent  te  beëindig  en  sodoende  ook  ekonomiese  en  maatskaplike
veiligheid te verseker. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Regional organisations, for example the SADC, can  and  must  also  play  a
decisive role to promote safety and security. In this regard  Ecowas  set  a
commendable example by establishing peace in Sierra Leone. Once  again,  the
SADC Protocol  on  Politics,  Defence  and  Security  Co-operation  has  the
capacity, especially in the DRC, to bring about  peace,  but  not  a  single
country of the SADC, not South Africa either, has  ratified  this  protocol.
Here as well this Parliament can play an important role by taking  the  lead
in this regard, and I trust that Parliament will  ratify  this  protocol  as
soon as possible, because it remains  the  only  way  to  help  multilateral
organisations to end conflict on the continent  and  in  so  doing  ensuring
economic and social safety.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, I agree  that  the  IPU,  of  which  we  are  a
member, ought to play a critical role to promote peace,  because  often  the
executive in various countries do not always act in the interests  of  their
citizenry in promoting peace, security and development.

Parliaments can play a role to pressure their own executives to desist  from
actions that can cause conflicts. However, before we  talk  about  the  role
parliaments can play to strengthen  multilateral  forums,  we  must  have  a
clear understanding of what our oversight role is in South Africa.  When  we
understand the role of our Parliament here at home,  we  must  play  it.  We
have to practise what we preach here.

We are prone to pretending that we are the standard to be followed, when  in
fact we are still hesitant or too intimidated to  assert  Parliament's  role
in our own national politics, as a stakeholder in  deepening  democracy  and
promoting social justice. We are  yet  to  see  Parliament  in  our  country
willing and prepared to  play  its  oversight  role  in  conflict  with  the
executive, but  in  tandem  with  public  interests.  Although  co-operation
between the executive and Parliament is desirable, this  should  not  be  at
the expense of constitutional values which we are obliged to observe.

The real question parliaments in parliamentary democracies,  such  as  ours,
ought to address urgently is how to strengthen parliament as an  independent
institution of the state. Are we ready to do what the British  are  doing  -
calling the executive head of the state  to  account  for  what  the  public
perceives as an erroneous decision  affecting  national  security?  When  we
have reached the British Parliament's degree of  maturity  and  courage,  we
can talk about playing our role in strengthening multilateral forums.

It is important that we begin to debate, even in the  next  Parliament,  how
we can strengthen this Parliament's role of oversight. Thank you.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Chairperson and hon  members,  threats  to  security
are many and varied. That is why most countries,  even  those  not  at  war,
spend most of their budgets on their security forces and on equipping  them.
All countries are at risk.  Whoever  would  have  thought  that  a  powerful
country  like  the  United  States,  with  its  wide  oceans,  sophisticated
weaponry and international reputation, could have experienced what  happened
on September 11 in 2001?

In the wake of that unfortunate incident  and  in  defiance  of  the  United
Nations, instead of seeking peace, President George Bush and Tony  Blair  of
England declared war on Iraq. It is history that  they  have  won  the  war,
and, after all, it is a war they could not lose. The big  question  for  now
is: How will they win peace? Many American young men continue to lose  their
lives in Iraq, yet the war is said to be over. Blair is struggling  for  his
political life because of the consequences of that war.

The time has come that parliamentarians learn that  atomic  bomb  stockpiles
are no guarantee of  security.  Parliamentarians  will  have  to  learn  and
accept that until greed, such as that for the  Iraqi  oil,  and  murder  are
removed from their hearts, there can be no peace  or  security.  Parliaments
should desist from spending lots of money  on  arms,  because  security  and
peace decline as security machinery expand.

Nowadays, parliaments around the world, even those  of  people  who  in  the
past were averse to the use of the words "terrorist" and  "terrorism",  have
come to accept those concepts in their legislative vocabulary, and they  are
at pains to put together laws against terrorism in their  quest  for  peace.
Governments have to be at peace with themselves, and  feel  secure  all  the
time in their quest for peace and security.

Parliaments have to play the role they are  instituted  for.  They  have  to
serve as watchdogs and not lapdogs with regard to governments. A  parliament
worth its salt will not hesitate to  call  into  question  the  performance,
programmes and policies of the executive. If parliaments  can  refrain  from
compromising on and conforming to issues raised by  the  executive,  we  can
have a peaceful world. I thank you.

Mr T JEEBODH: Deputy Chairperson, fellow  comrades  and  colleagues,  it  is
indeed an honour to stand here and be counted as a proud South  African.  As
is customary of those who deliver their maiden speeches, their knees  wobble
and lumps appear in their throats. But for those who were disfranchised,  it
is indeed a special moment.

I now move on to the business of the day - the issues that touch the  hearts
and minds of every human being, namely peace and security.  In  Hinduism  it
is believed that in the cycle of reincarnation, the highest reward  of  life
is to be born a human being. It is  certainly  a  high  status,  but  do  we
respect the status that is  bestowed  upon  us?  In  our  quest  for  power,
wealth, greed and supremacy, we as  humans  have  lowered  ourselves.  Since
time immemorial, mankind has been at loggerheads with its fellow beings.

The First  World  War  brought  the  casualties  of  millions  of  dead  and
displaced people, along with disease and  severe  hardship.  Only  then  did
some leaders, one being President  Woodrow  Wilson  of  the  United  States,
agitate for a world body at which humans and nations could sit  and  discuss
issues before reverting to war and genocide. Thus the League of Nations  was
born. It did not have real teeth, but the initiative had  been  taken.  Then
came the Second World War. The miseries, deaths and  hardships  compared  to
that of the First World War were tenfold. The need for  a  world  body  with
real teeth and powers became so much more apparent. Thus the United  Nations
was born in 1945.

Now, 58 years later, the United Nations still has the  initial  charters  in
place,  but  much  has  changed  since  then  -  politically,  socially  and
economically. The structure  of  the  United  Nations  has  to  change.  The
question of the permanent members has been on the agenda for  a  long  time,
but very little  that  is  concrete  has  emanated.  With  some  democracies
flourishing  in  the  countries  which  obtained  independence  from   their
previous colonial masters, the need for collective bodies in  Africa  arose:
the OAU or the African Union, and SADC.

Our own President Mbeki, a key architect of the  formation  of  the  AU  and
SADC and its economic and recovery programme, leads the way.  From  being  a
pariah state to being a world leader, the  ANC,  its  Government  and  South
Africa have led the way for the rest of  Africa  to  follow.  From  being  a
terrorist country, which not only terrorised its own people but  a  host  of
sub-Saharan countries, the ANC, from 1994, has made  South  Africa  and  its
people readily acceptable to the whole world. Our sportsmen can now  compete
in world events, our finished goods grace  the  entire  world,  our  flowers
adorn Chelsea, and even the opposition parties with far right views can  sit
and debate in this Chamber without any fear. Now, does  that  not  tell  you
something? [Applause.]

The United Nations can effect the many changes needed to bring  about  peace
and security. Let there be structural changes and let  policy-making  powers
be granted to the  General  Assembly,  where  recommendations  made  by  the
General Assembly have legal and practical effects and where  law-making  has
capacity. Then, and only  then,  can  rogue  countries  and  criminals,  and
statesmen found guilty of transgressing human rights, pilfering  from  state
coffers and committing genocide, be brought to book.

There are those economists who stated that the growth rate in  the  80s  and
the 90s in this country was  between  4%  and  8%.  But  this  was  a  false
assertion, because South Africa  was  divided  into  little,  self-governing
Bantustans. However, since gaining independence and democracy  in  1994,  no
industrialist  or  businessman  has  lost  his  or  her   property   through
nationalisation. South Africa even honours the  apartheid  debt  which  P  W
Botha and De Klerk used to purchase arms to suppress internal dissent.

Like the Chinese proverb that a journey of a thousand miles  begins  with  a
single step, this country has started that journey. We are  not  there,  but
we most certainly have started. The various groupings throughout  the  world
- the African Union for Africa, the European Union  for  Europe,  the  Asia-
Pacific Rim, the Eastern Asian Union, the Commonwealth  and  many  others  -
aspire to the same objectives.

South Africa's vision for peace, security  and  governance  is  embodied  in
Nepad and the African Recovery Programme. The poverty  and  backwardness  of
Africa  and  other  developing  nations  stand  in  stark  contrast  to  the
prosperity of the developed world. The continued marginalisation  of  Africa
from the  globalisation  process  and  the  social  exclusion  of  the  vast
majority of its people constitute a serious threat to global stability.  The
initiative calls for the reversal of the abnormal situation by changing  the
relationship that underpins it. Africans and  developing  countries  are  no
longer appealing for the further entrenchment  of  dependency  through  aid,
nor marginal concessions, nor handouts. We are  convinced  that  a  historic
opportunity presents itself to end  the  scourge  of  underdevelopment  that
afflicts Africa, the so-called Third World and developing countries.

The resources that  are  required,  namely  capital,  technology  and  human
skills, to launch a global war on  poverty  and  underdevelopment  exist  in
abundance and are within our grasp.  What  is  required  to  mobilise  these
resources and to use them properly  are  bold  and  imaginative  leadership,
general commitment to a sustained effort of  human  upliftment  and  poverty
eradication,  as  well  as  a  new  global  partnership   based   on   joint
responsibility and mutual interest.

Meaningful  economic  activity  is  impossible  under  conditions  of  armed
conflict. It is also inhibited by the existence of states,  either  captured
by narrow private interests or lacking  in  capacity  to  deliver  on  their
developmental  mandates.  Whilst  commitments   to   peace   and   security,
democracy, human rights and  sound  economic  governance  must  be  seen  as
preconditions for a programme of renewal, there will continue to be  a  need
for constant vigilance, consolidation and a strengthening of capacity.

If peace and security are to lead to sustained growth and  development,  the
strengthening of the capacity of the state to  fulfil  its  responsibilities
is  of  the  utmost  urgency.   Those   responsibilities   include   poverty
eradication and development, and ensuring democracy, popular  participation,
human rights and respect for the rule of  law,  thus  creating  a  conducive
environment   for   private-sector   mobilisation   and    for    responding
appropriately to the process of globalisation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr M  S  MOGOBA:  Chairperson,  national  parliaments  are,  or  should  be,
pyramids of democracy dotted all over the world, representing  the  hope  of
the survival of humanity. They therefore have a clear role to  play  in  the
realisation of the best of humanity's dreams.

Humankind is capable of great achievements, like flying to the moon or  even
walking on it. It is, unfortunately, also capable of  unbelievable  follies.
The unforgettable implosion of  the  magnificent  World  Trade  Centre  twin
towers on 11 September was a dramatic display of how quickly and  tragically
our global village can fold up.

Other less dramatic but equally  tragic  events  include,  inter  alia,  the
South African apartheid holocaust, and the unbelievable African carnages  in
Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia and Liberia which claimed millions or billions  of
innocent  lives.  We  have  recently  had  religious  and  ethnic  cleansing
episodes in Eastern Europe, Pakistan and India, and the  Palestinian-Israeli
War has desecrated the biblical  Holy  Land.  Then  the  USA-UK  Iraqi  War,
against the dictates  of  the  United  Nations,  dashed  the  hopes  of  the
civilised world by causing the institution which was the remaining  hope  of
the civilised world to haemorrhage.

The Business Day yesterday had a headline which read: "US$75 billion  needed
to rebuild Iraq." This shameful and scandalous misuse  of  scarce  resources
happens at a time when the poor are hungry and have no money  to  fast-track
research on HIV/Aids. Parliaments like our own are  watchdogs  of  processes
that lead to conflict situations. Democratic processes should be watched  in
our own country. As the general elections approach, we  should  ensure  that
we level the playing fields and encourage our neighbours, like Zimbabwe,  to
do the same. Free and fair elections should not  be  glib  talk.  We  should
ensure that real democracy happens. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi. [In the name of women.] Deputy  Chair,
as history is made with the passing of the clock, rivalry  and  unrest  have
left their mark on each state.  The  world  stands  with  its  own  dilemma,
watching itself crumble as man violently tries to attain his wants,  desires
and what he individually believes is owed to him.

When we look at our newspapers and  at  ourselves,  we  see  apartheid,  the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, al Qaeda, terrorism, Indonesia,  Liberia,  the
Sudan, Nigeria, Korea - there are too many to mention; I can go on  and  on.
When we look at our newspapers,  it  is  global  conflict  and  its  effects
socially, economically and politically that fill the  pages.  Global  unrest
and conflicts have major repercussions on our global state. At  times,  this
is  like  a  monopoly  game  in  which  larger  First  World  countries  use
opportunities to maintain their stance.

It is an unfortunate reality that international peace and security  is  much
more like a game. Poverty, one of the  world's  largest  problems,  in  line
with the population explosion, the horrific results of the  deadly  HIV/Aids
pandemic, malaria and TB and the many other  socioeconomic  imbalances  make
global peace a difficult task to achieve. But it is by debating the  subject
that we voice our concern and take the first step in working towards  global
peace and security.

The MF notes that in many conventions and conferences the world attempts  to
work towards this, but also notes that although many countries pledge  their
commitment  to  human  rights,  they   seldom   religiously   uphold   their
commitment. This reminds me of the last words of our great  Mahatma  Gandhi.
When his life was leaving his body,  he  said:  "Peace,  peace,  peace,  may
peace be with the world."

The MF does not want to focus this debate on any one country as an  example,
but feels rather that  the  subject  of  international  peace  and  security
should be looked at in terms  of  South  Africa,  and  whether  we  maintain
international  security  for  our  people  with  the  global  politics  that
magnetises the world. International peace and security, the MF feels,  is  a
global responsibility that begins  with  each  individual.  Thank  you  very
much, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Mr M M CHIKANE: Chairperson, since the advent of democracy in  our  country,
and after overcoming the legacy of the past that made  us  the  polecats  of
the world, the new agenda has to be to pursue,  with  tenacity  and  vigour,
ridding our country of poverty, unemployment, social inequality  and  hunger
in the country of plenty. To succeed in this, we have to know our  strengths
and weaknesses. We must use the best instruments, from all  those  who  know
that this is our only home, to  resolve  these  discrepancies  speedily  and
with determination.

The world cannot find us. We should go out there  and  discover  the  world,
and  join  hands  with  our  citizens  in   contestation   of   ideas.   The
International Parliamentary Union is one of such fortresses  that  can  echo
President Mbeki's opening parliamentary address when he said that there  are
two worlds. And, short of maintaining those hostilities,  we  should  rather
increase the size of the cake.

The two worlds must collide to form one strong,  formative  force  that  can
withstand all negative forces that are imposed by our  not-so-distant  past.
We must forge ahead as a united and single-minded community,  and  pronounce
ourselves as South Africans. Let us  not  only  find  common  cause  amongst
ourselves, but with the likeminded that constitute the IPU.

Let all nations resolve, as at the 103rd conference in Switzerland,  Geneva,
to uphold a section of the declaration which reads thus, and I quote:


  ... considering that parliamentarians,  as  the  representatives  of  the
  people,  play  an  important  role  in   promoting   the   dialogue   and
  strengthening the  cordial  ties  between  nations  and  peoples  in  the
  political, economic and cultural fields with the view of attaining global
  stability and peace ...

As an exporting country, we continually open doors in Africa and  elsewhere.
The IPU cannot but remain a solid platform for  this  purpose.  Our  agenda,
the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development,  which  has  become   our
embryonic cord, will remain a pipe dream if we do not  participate  in  such
organisations. The motor  industry,  which  has  become  a  bastion  of  job
creation, will grind to a halt if momentum is lost in  continually  breaking
new ground.

Our resolve to put the question of the girl-child and women has won us  many
friends. All we said is what was said, but  it  was  Mandela's  and  Mbeki's
country endorsing it which carried our colleagues in the  African  continent
and the world over.

Under the leadership of our most able Deputy Speaker, Ms Baleka Mbete,  that
team spirit of being truly South African reigned in  the  corridors  of  the
Chilean chambers. The very-often disjointed discord  in  the  African  group
produced the melody that Africa's time has arrived.

The respect and honour bestowed on us made us truly  part  of  you  all,  in
this House. Mahlangu, Borman, Bakker and Van der  Merwe  were  your  voices.
All that brought us closer to the dance of what used to be a distant  sound.


We should not and we cannot let go of the resolve that this  is  an  African
century and we are the players, not spectators. Thank you. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Chairperson, we live  in  an  increasingly  changing  world
order. The globalisation of violence currently  takes  the  form  of  global
versus regional  conflicts  which  ought  to  be  managed  by  the  numerous
multilateral organisations in order to ensure peace and security.

The United Nations system, the most representative international  forum,  is
basically state-centred with a  total  of  approximately  200  states  being
represented. Regional organisations such as the  African  Union  and,  to  a
certain extent, SADC, Ecowas and Ecomog indicate  that  regions  are  taking
charge of their future. It is the interaction  between  the  United  Nations
system  and  the  regional  organisations,  with  parliaments   playing   an
important role, which will determine whether success  will  be  obtained  in
building an international coalition for change.
Ensuring peace and  security  should  include  acting  against  cross-border
threats to peace and stability, transnational organised crime and  terrorism
in particular. Parliaments acting within subregional organisations, as  well
as regional policing structures, should lead to an information exchange  and
full participation as agents in ensuring co-ordinated efforts in  the  fight
against violence.

Parliaments have an important role to play in  ensuring  that  the  combined
and co-ordinated approach of the subregional and regional organisations  and
the United Nations system leads to a renewed enforcement of  a  co-ordinated
effort to achieve effective border  control,  firearms  control  and,  ever-
increasingly, corruption control.

Parliament has a duty of maintaining stability in  a  democracy  within  the
changing environment by, particularly, promoting human  rights  development.
It is important to note that solutions to peace and security issues must  be
tailormade with sustainable and long-lasting consequences. It is  only  with
the co-operation of Parliament, within  the  various  mentioned  structures,
through which it will be ensured that leading individuals do not line  their
bank accounts, and that they separate business and government  in  order  to
preserve Government's role within the parliamentary system. Politicians  and
policy-makers should focus, in the long term,  on  wealth-creating  benefits
which will ensure peace and security.

The growth of a world  economy  leads  to  a  proliferation  of  global  and
transnational threats that transcend state borders. Parliament's role is  to
ensure that the recognition of basic human rights,  regardless  of  national
boundaries and internal laws, prevails; and to prevent the proliferation  of
migration, population expansion, disease and famine.

South Africa's participation in peace operations under the auspices  of  the
United Nations, the African Union and SADC, in terms  whereof  approximately
2 900 South African service  personnel  are  currently  deployed,  indicates
support for regional and international  organisations  such  as  the  United
Nations and  the  African  Union.  However,  it  is  Parliament's  duty  and
function to  be  fully  informed  of  all  facts,  dangers  and  risks  when
supporting such bold measures.

The decision  to  determine  whether  to  embark  on  a  particular  mission
requires consultation, co-ordination and effective  decision-making  by  the
South African  Parliament.  Parliament  is  pivotal  in  ensuring  continued
support from the South African population regarding deployment in  terms  of
regional and international mandates. Therefore, a  more  inclusive  approach
towards Parliament should be followed by the executive and,  in  particular,
the President in ensuring that Parliament is thoroughly informed as  to  the
details, risks, costs as well  as  duration  of  the  period  regarding  the
personnel to be deployed.

A  one-page  letter  that  appeared  in  the  Announcements,  Tablings   and
Committee Reports is, with respect, not good enough.  Parliament  should  be
comprehensively briefed, or, at  least,  its  Joint  Standing  Committee  on
Defence, on all intended missions before the actual deployment takes  place.
Stability, peace, security  and  building  an  international  coalition  for
peace are premised on proper and  informed  decision-making  by  members  of
parliaments,  acting  within  the  mentioned   subregional,   regional   and
international institutions. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D J SITHOLE: Chairperson and hon members, peace  is  a  precondition  for
development. It is therefore an objective we should all strive for.

As we discuss this, we should do so by paying  our  respects  to  those  who
died in the bombing of the US  embassy  in  Kenya,  praying  for  those  who
perished on September 11 in the USA; and we should also pray for  the  women
and children who died in Tanzania. We should not forget those  who  died  in
an illegal and illegitimate war on Iraq  or  Palestinian  children  who  are
exposed to missile bombings on a daily basis. We  should  continue  to  work
for the safety of the children and women of Israel.

I had the opportunity to visit the  August  7th  Memorial  Park  in  Nairobi
built in honour of the innocent people who died because they were  perceived
by those who commanded weapons as a legitimate target. Recently, I also  had
the opportunity to visit the Genocide Memorial Site in Rwanda, where  almost
a million innocent people were killed. The numbers of people who are  killed
compel all peace-loving people  of  the  world  to  confront  the  challenge
imposed on us by those who prefer war instead of peace.

The outcome of the Iraqi war is an indication  that  war  does  not  produce
conditions for co-existence for those who are locked  in  a  confrontational
frame of mind.

Parliament  is  currently  engaged  in  discussions  to  formulate  a  legal
instrument to fight terrorism. We hope that the UN discussions  will  result
in a definition that will be all-encompassing. As  we  commit  ourselves  to
fighting against terrorism, we should avoid temptations of the  powerful  to
decide who they want to declare a terrorist and who not. [Applause.]  It  is
the UN that is entrusted with the responsibility of our collective  security
and, therefore, it must be reinforced to ensure that it can protect us all.

Building UN organs to enable them to enforce peace  and  co-existence  among
people is a critical task that not only faces political leaders but  mankind
as a whole. International  organisations  can  only  accomplish  what  their
member states enable them  to  accomplish.  This  issue  brings  us  to  the
critical task of restructuring the UN and,  specifically,  the  UN  Security
Council. Therefore we should ensure that we all  subject  ourselves  to  the
authority of the UN, not to the authority of  individuals,  irrespective  of
their power.

The war on terrorism will not be  won  unless  we  address  the  fundamental
problems that create conditions conducive for it to  thrive.  Poverty  is  a
breeding ground for those who advocate extremism. It cannot  be  right  that
developed nations spend US$3 per day for a cow and only US$1 for  people  in
poor countries. We will only win the fight against terrorism if we  confront
the challenge of poverty, underdevelopment and  marginalisation  of  certain
sections of our community.

In ensuring that peace and security exist in the world,  we  must  build  an
international coalition for peace. However, we must ensure that  the  nature
and format of such a coalition serve the interests of  peace,  and  not  the
interests of  warmongers.  Civil  society  must  play  a  critical  role  in
ensuring that we are not led to war by those who find it difficult  to  live
in peace and who find solutions to problems of the world by  declaring  wars
and subscribing to the doctrine of regime changes.

Peace and security should be what every  state,  government  and  individual
must work for. Peace and security should be for everybody, not only for  the
few powerful. It should also be for the poverty-stricken rural poor.  It  is
with pride that, since the ANC  took  over  power  in  this  country,  South
Africa has committed itself and has worked tirelessly to bring about  peace,
not only on the continent but in the world.  This  commitment  to  peace  is
enunciated in our Stellenbosch conference  resolutions.  The  ANC  committed
itself to opposing aggressive  unilateralism  as  adopted  by  some  Western
countries in fighting the threat of terrorism.

As we reject unilateralism,  we  equally  oppose  all  forms  of  terrorism,
including state terrorism, because we believe  that  the  solution  to  deal
with this lies with multilateral structures and should  be  conducted  under
the aegis of the UN. It is the multilateral  structures  that  can  help  to
produce peace for all.

The work  of  South  Africa  on  the  continent  will  be  enhanced  by  the
ratification of the treaty  establishing  the  Peace  and  Security  Council
charged with the responsibility of bringing peace  to  the  continent.  This
organ will provide us with the opportunity to  intensify  the  work  we  are
doing in the Great Lakes region, which is that of  building  conditions  for
peace and development.

Sending our troops to the Great Lakes is in line  with  our  endeavours  and
desire to create conditions for economic development, and is  a  good  thing
to do. It has been an issue among many commentators that we are  spending  a
lot of resources on the African continent. This concern  is  informed  by  a
lack of appreciation of the  fact  that  our  existence  is  linked  to  the
continent.

As South  Africa,  we  cannot  extricate  ourselves  from  the  difficulties
presented by poverty and underdevelopment on the continent. We are,  in  the
first instance, African, and therefore it is our duty to work for peace  and
prosperity for the people on the African continent.

As legislatures, we must look at ourselves and locate the role we must  play
in building a peace movement. We should ensure that  the  UN  protocol  that
deals with issues of justice is ratified. Yes, there are those who claim  to
be democrats, but they are allergic to subjecting themselves to the rule  of
law, and they are prepared to do anything, even using money, to force  other
states to help them not to subject themselves to the international  rule  of
law. [Applause.]
Looking at the question paper this afternoon and  the  questions  that  were
asked by members, I was disappointed by members who  raised  one  issue  and
talked about another at the podium. If one looks at the question  raised  by
the hon Gibson, the follow-up questions that he raised and what he  said  at
this podium, one will find a  naked  contradiction  to  what  he  supposedly

They regard themselves as not being part of the continent's  problems.  They
regard themselves as not being responsible for ensuring that there is  peace

building peace. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 18:15.
