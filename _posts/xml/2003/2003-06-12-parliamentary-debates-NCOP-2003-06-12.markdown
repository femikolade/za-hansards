                   POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION OF SPORT HEROES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -
       (a)  Sarfu has honoured a hero  of  yesteryear,  the  late  Mr  Grant
           Khomo, who played for the first black Springbok team in a  match
           against a coloured Springbok team;


       (b)  Sarfu has launched a new U-16 tournament on similar lines as the
           Coca-Cola Craven Week; and


       (c)  Mr Khomo was also a national tennis  champion  and  excelled  in
           both cricket and soccer; and


  (2) welcomes this posthumous recognition  as  a  building  block  towards
       bringing unity in rugby and sport in general.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               PRESIDENT COMMENDED FOR WORK DONE AT G8 SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that, since the G8 Summit, 30% of Nepad's priority projects are
       being implemented;


  (2)  further  notes  that  18  capacity-building  projects,  24   of   52
       facilitation projects, 8 of  36  investment  projects  and  3  of  18
       studies on the short-term action-plan are being implemented;


  (3) believes that it was through hard work and sweat by the Presidents of
       South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal and Algeria and African leaders  as  a
       collective that Nepad is at the stage of implementation; and


  (4) therefore  commends  our  President  and  his  counterparts  for  the
       outstanding work done.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        LIBERIAN PRESIDENT APPLAUDED

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and applauds the agreement between Liberia's president and  the
       rebel forces to halt hostilities and thereby pave the way  for  peace
       talks;


  (2) further notes that this is as a result of intervention by the African
       Union to bring about a peaceful  resolution  to  the  hostilities  in
       Liberia;


  (3) believes that this offers a glimmer of hope to Liberians fleeing  the
       conflict;


  (4) further believes that this  intervention  by  African  leaders  as  a
       collective is a clear indication that  Africa  can  resolve  its  own
       problems; and


  (5) therefore congratulates the AU on this achievement.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   MASS DECIMATION OF OUR FLORA AND FAUNA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its grave concern at the mass decimation of our  flora  and
       fauna and indigenous animals by  tourists  from  Europe,  Canada  and
       especially the United States;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  for a few dollars they shoot down these animals,  only  to  hang
           their heads as prizes in their homes overseas;


       (b)  these animals take years to grow old, just to be shot and killed
           for fun rather than for need;


       (c)  in today's Business Day it is stated that last year alone,  more
           than 14 000 animals were killed in hunting grounds of Limpopo;


       (d)  if we add up these killings that occur in the  Free  State,  the
           Eastern Cape and many other provinces, it becomes clear that  we
           have allowed an enormous wanton destruction and loss in a  short
           space of time while we are in Government; and


       (e)  Europe has no more original lions and elephants and now they are
           finishing off our remaining and dwindling numbers of fowl, flora
           and fauna;


  (3) urges tourists to shoot with cameras rather than  with  bullets  that
       kill and destroy; and


  (4) believes that -


       (a)  the practice of accepting blood money from tourists needs to  be
           reviewed;


       (b)  tourism should promote survival of the species and the future of
           our motherland; and


       (c)  money is not everything - God has called on us as people  to  be
           stewards of all creation.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 OPPOSITION TO MIDDLE EAST PEACE INITIATIVE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern recent development in the Middle East in which  26
       people died as a result of attempts  to  kill  the  Hamas  leader  on
       Tuesday;


  (2) further notes that the attempts to assassinate the Hamas  leader  and
       the  suicide  vengeance  bombing  on  Wednesday  put  the  initiative
       relating to the proposed "road map" for the Middle East in jeopardy;


  (3) believes that there are people opposed to the "road map" who will  do
       everything in their power to destabilise this initiative;


  (4) further believes that an end to the conflict  can  be  brought  about
       through peaceful means;
  (5) calls upon all peace-loving citizens in the Middle  East,  especially
       in Israel and Palestine, not to be dissuaded by certain  elements  in
       their resolve for peace; and


  (6) further calls upon all those involved in conflict to desist from  any
       further attacks and give peaceful initiatives a chance.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    PRESIDENT MBEKI AT THE ILO IN GENEVA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  notes  that  yesterday   President   Thabo   Mbeki   addressed   the
       International Labour Organisation in Geneva;
  (2) also notes the historic contribution that he has made and comments by
       participants who remarked that "such veneration was only received  by
       speakers such as Martin Luther King";


  (3) further notes comments by another participant that "over  the  decade
       of my participation I have never heard such an inspiring speech";


  (4) recognises that President  Thabo  Mbeki  has  again  placed  poverty,
       reconstruction and development  of  Africa  on  the  agenda  of  this
       important forum; and


  (5)  commends  the  President  for  his  unwavering  commitment  to   the
       resolution of the plight of the  Africans  and  his  appeal  for  the
       shared  responsibility  of  all  stakeholders  in  pushing  back  the
       frontiers of poverty.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy Debate)

Debate on Vote No 10 - Public Service and Administration.

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATION:  Deputy  Chairperson
and members of this august House, we as this House,  as  Parliament,  gather
today to review the budget vote of the  Public  Service  and  Administration
that  covers  three  votes:   the   Department   of   Public   Service   and
Administration, the  SA  Management  Development  Institute  and  the  State
Information Technology Agency. It also covers quite a basket and a  grouping
of dynamic institutions.  There  are  two,  in  addition  to  those  that  I
mentioned, in line with the  budget  vote.  It  is  the  Centre  for  Public
Service Innovation, as well as the  Independent  Public  Service  Commission
which is a Chapter 10 institution.

For me it has been a great honour over the period of the past  four,  moving
on to five  years,  to  work  with  these  five  dynamic  institutions.  The
Department of Public Service and Administration plays  a  policy-development
role, and produces an impressive volume of quality  work  that  successfully
addresses pertinent and important issues in the area of public  service  and
administration.

The SA Management Development Institute is becoming  increasingly  important
in developing and building public service skills and  capacity,  but  it  is
also important to note that they have a role  to  play  in  the  region  and
globally, to not only see themselves as  a  service  provider  in  terms  of
training, but also to assist in the development of  thinking  of  the  Human
Resource Development Trust in terms of  needs  in  the  public  service  and
obviously impacting on the economy as a whole.

The Centre for Public Service Innovation is a leading centre for  thoughtful
and creative solutions, as well as ideas on public service improvement,  and
I will reflect on this in my input this afternoon.

The State Information Agency is well set effectively to  integrate  and  co-
ordinate Government information systems, whilst,  on  the  other  hand,  the
Public  Service  Commission  has  grown  impressively  into  its   role   of
monitoring and evaluating the Public Service, as well as  promoting  a  very
high level of professional ethics in  the  Public  Service  and  undertaking
quite detailed investigations.

As we look at this today, I want us to do so against  the  background  of  a
message raised by the President in his state of the nation address  when  he
told us that with regard to  changing  the  lives  of  South  Africans,  and
building relations of human solidarity with peoples of the world,  the  tide
has turned. He said that our task was  to  take  this  tide  at  the  flood,
further to progress towards the achievement of the goals for which  so  many
of our people sacrificed. I know that for many in this House today, both  in
the benches of the NCOP and those  in  the  gallery,  this  is  not  a  mere
academic exercise, but a reality in terms of what  you  have  lived  through
and experienced as South African people and as peoples of the world  and  of
our region.

I  want  to  very  quickly  look  at  the   issue   of   restructuring   for
effectiveness, restructuring our public  service  into  a  kind  of  people-
centred delivery vehicle, Batho Pele, and how we make  that  a  reality.  On
stating that, I am immediately going to  go  into  the  fact  that  I  would
assume that the past will be something that we consider as we look  at  this
debate today. We should  acknowledge  that  our  restructuring  efforts  are
still incomplete, and that remaining challenges  were  concentrated  in  the
areas of, firstly, the distribution and redistribution of our most  valuable
and valued assets in the Public Service, our people.

Firstly, are they geographically spread in a manner that will  allow  us  to
support those that were the most historically  disadvantaged,  in  order  to
ensure that they now  access  quality  services?  Are  our  public  servants
adequately concentrated  in  those  sectors  that  are  prioritised  in  our
acceptance of the role of the developmental stat, and  our  vision  of  that
particular development?

Secondly, skills must be matched with competencies. We have  inherited  some
historically, and some we brought on board during the past ten  years.Do  we
have the particular skills demanded from public servants  working  in  South
Africa at the beginning of the 21st century? To put it bluntly, do  we  have
on board what it will take to take us through the challenges ahead,  and  if
not, what do we intend doing about that?

It is important that public  servants  are  deployed  where  they  are  most
needed, and can have the biggest impact. I will identify the most  pertinent
areas. Social services sectors should be prioritised and whilst most  public
servants are employed in the social service sector,  in  some  provinces,  a
disproportionate number of staff  are  deployed  elsewhere.  I  raised  this
yesterday, and I will  specifically  raise  it  in  this  House  today.  For
example, whilst Gauteng and the Western Cape employ 6,1%  and  7%  of  their
staff respectively in the nonsocial services sector,  Limpopo  province  has
23,6% of its staff in the nonsocial services sector. We  believe  that  such
inconsistency must be reviewed and this has been taken on board as  we  deal
with the restructuring of the public service. That  tool  and  mechanism  is
being utilised to deepen the broader transformation of  the  public  service
sector.

We all acknowledge that transformation is not a  one-year  project,  and  it
cannot be a five-year project. But, as we tackle this project  of  making  a
change of this colossus machinery, we need to ensure that  those  short-term
interventions that are required are appropriate to exactly effect that.

Provinces now comprise of around 70% of the public service in terms  of  the
number of people they employ. Yet, they only employ  40%  of  the  total  of
senior managers in Government, nationally and  provincially.  This  suggests
that the provinces lack management  capacity,  though  national  departments
generally address issues that require a higher  level  of  skill,  and  thus
more senior staff.  We  are  increasingly  aware  of  the  need  to  support
provincial managers in their work. Provincial departments also  tend  to  be
larger than national departments, and as a result of their size,  they  tend
to find it difficult to plan the use of their human and financial  resources
effectively.

Generally, the poorer  province  tends  to  employ  excessively  low-skilled
workers, many of whom are not needed.  As  a  result  of  this  legacy,  the
supernumerary phenomenon or excess public servants, are found in the  public
service in the provinces. We can look at  Limpopo  province  as  a  case  in
point. In the  late  eighties,  thousands  of  drought-relief  workers  were
appointed on contract basis. Between 1991 and  1993,  in  a  very  expedient
way, those contract workers were employed as  permanent  workers.  They  had
very low skills levels, and no clear functions. At this point in time,  that
province, in the Departments of Agriculture and of Public Works,  are  stuck
with those numbers.

We need to do something about it, because we  cannot  retain  those  in  the
public service who are not skilled to take forward the  challenges  required
in order to meet the needs of  people  first,  and  to  effect  the  service
delivery that all of you in this House require.

In the restructuring to  address  these  problems,  we  generated  a  shared
vision of the kind of developmental  and  participatory  public  service  we
want in future. For example Public Service commission  research  shows  that
most of the national  and  provincial  departments  incorporated  programmes
that were  aimed  at  poverty  alleviation,  and  very  clearly  looking  at
national priorities of the country.

Let me quickly refer to the personnel expenditure review. I  have  reflected
on the need to deploy  public  servants  in  those  areas  and  meeting  the
critical skills required in those areas, and I won't reflect on  that.  But,
let me immediately zoom in on Resolution 7, a resolution that  tends  to  be
much misunderstood, and which is sometimes used in political  game  playing,
where there is deliberate misinterpretation of this. The resolution  itself,
an agreement reached between employer and trade unions, is  one  that  looks
at the transformation and restructuring of the Public Service. Its  emphasis
is on the appropriate and  effective  placement  and  utilisation  of  human
resources. It provides mechanisms for matching human resources  requirements
to service delivery needs in order to ensure that we  have  optimal  service
delivery.

Secondly, it is also for the  redeployment  of  personnel  from  departments
where their skills are the least needed to where  they  would  be  optimally
utilised. I believe that every public servant would want to work in an  area
that matches their skills needs, and where they can be best utilised. It  is
also for the retraining of personnel  and  the  exploration  of  alternative
employment opportunities for those  personnel  who  have  been  declared  in
excess,  and  for   compliance   with   national   employment   legislation.
Essentially,  we  are  envisaging  that  it  will  resolve  the  problem  of
inappropriate  deployment  of  staff,  while  increasing  productivity   and
ensuring the delivery of better quality services. We also  believe  that  it
will assist us in identifying the skills gaps  in  the  public  service.  It
will no longer be a theory or a perception upon which our ideas of where  we
believe the scarce skills are based, but will now, through this process,  be
able to state that finally we know where the gaps are.

Let me, very quickly, make one last point on this. The  Department  for  the
Public  Service  and  Administration  can  actually  provide  support   that
includes  the   identification   and   payment   of   human   resource   and
organisational development specialists, that will assist departments,  where
required, with the finalisation and the alignment of  management  plans  and
organisational structures. We will also assist  in  cases  where  grievances
have been lodged in connection with the  process,  and  we  have  encouraged
public servants who may not be quite satisfied or clear  with  the  process,
to  actually  approach  the  management  in   their   departments   to   get
explanations for that.

Let me look at integration at many levels and  the  improved  strategic  and
financial management in most provinces. Over the last few  years,  provinces
have  generally  improved   their   strategic   and   financial   management
performance. The total national budget for 2003-04 is around  R334  billion,
including death service costs. Of this, the provinces received the  greatest
allocation - R159 billion or just less than 57%. This is about  96%  of  the
provincial revenues.  National  Government,  received  38,9%.  This  clearly
shows that enhancing  provincial  effectiveness  is  absolutely  crucial  if
social and economic  development  initiatives  are  to  have  their  desired
effects in the longer term.

Carefully sequenced budget reform has led  to  improved  planning,  enhanced
transparency and accountability and  better  service  delivery.  Three  year
budgets,  along  with   the   Public   Finance   Management   Act,   created
institutional mechanisms and dynamism  that  require  and  encourage  better
management. I will then go on  and  briefly  touch  on  integrating  service
delivery and the issue, and I will refer to this in  passing,  of  a  single
Public Service. Yesterday I have mentioned that  we  have  been  considering
the creation of  a  single  coherent  Public  Service,  and  while  we  have
achieved much in this regard, we still have much more to do.

Our decade in Government has shown and taught us that  improving  management
in  a  single  department  will  deliver  some  results,  but   the   multi-
institutional integrated improvements will be the most  likely  to  lead  to
sustained service delivery,  because  the  public  service  and  departments
within it cannot operate as if they  were  separate  projects.  Its  like  a
machinery  that  has  to  deliver  services  that  gives   effect   to   the
developmental state. In my ministry, and our  associated  organisations,  we
are committed to ensuring that our structures are  based  on  functions  and
strategy.

Citizens need one-stop value-adding interactions with Government. They  also
need such an interaction were there shouldn't be any door that is the  wrong
one. We should ensure that they are  not  sent  from  pillar  to  post  when
trying to access services. There are examples of such  one  stop  service  -
Galishewe in the Northern Cape comes to mind as I think of that,  and  there
are many others. The Centre for Public Service Innovation is helping  us  to
think about integration in terms of what is required by  policy,  structure,
systems and staffing.

Let me go to the integrated provincial support project. I am just  going  to
highlight some projects, because we don't have  much  time  this  afternoon.
Let me start with the Eastern Cape very quickly, and just state that one  of
the projects that this flagship has done in  that  province,  has  been  the
updating of human resource records in the  Eastern  Cape.  All  of  us  have
heard of stacks of files in offices in the Eastern Cape. We  know  that  the
importance of well-kept basic administrative records is unquestionable  when
it comes to running organisations effectively. And  hence,  there  has  been
work to improve the file management in the social  grants  sections  of  the
Eastern Cape department of welfare and social development.

Through this process, we have seen a complete review of  the  management  of
1,81 million beneficiary files in  the  process  of  creating  an  automated
system and managing to clear all backlogs  in  social  grants  applications.
Clearly, the file management system will not on their own solve other  deep-
rooted organisational problems. But what this project has done  is  to  give
some hope to beneficiaries, and to create a platform for further  work  that
the interim management team, that is currently working in the Eastern  Cape,
is doing work on.

I want to reflect on the Limpopo province very quickly.  In  terms  of  that
province, I want to reflect on two projects that this  particular  programme
is working on. We believe that enough work has been done  to  plan  for  the
turnaround of the Letaba and  the  Maphutha-Malatji  hospitals  in  Limpopo.
Focus will now be on the implementation of the plans.  The  support  of  the
integrated provincial support team, in this regard, has been aligned to  the
Department of Health's hospital revitalisation  programme.  These,  together
with other initiatives of the  provincial  administration,  are  creating  a
critical force for service delivery excellence.

Having acted personally with key role-players, in these hospitals  recently,
I want to isolate the CEO of one hospital, Dr Rajpal, I think, who has  been
leading the process at the Letaba Hospital.  There  is  another  supervisor,
and the other one I am not going to mention his name, because I  don't  want
to make a mistake with the surname. I am sensitive when people  mispronounce
``Moleketi'', so I don't want  to  mispronounce  others'  surnames.  Anyway,
interacting with these role-players, I  am  convinced  that  they  requisite
momentum has been generated to take the tide at the flood.

The predominant attitude at the hospitals is that  of  working  together  to
revitalise Batho Pele. It is a spirit that recognises  that  challenges  and
constraints exist, but at least should nonetheless not  derail  people  from
the noble path of striving towards better health care for the public.

Still in the Limpopo province, a lot of work has  been  done  regarding  the
transformation and reorientation of facilities inherited from  the  previous
government,  focusing  especially  on  sisal  and  commercial   agricultural
facilities. Some of these facilities where not sustainable from  their  very
inception, and didn't benefit local communities at all.

With the IPSP support,  the  province  is  now  implementing  a  model  that
largely involves a social contract between  local  communities,  labour  and
private equity partners. By implementing this model,  the  Zebediela  Citrus
Estate, and think all of us know of Zebediela,  at  least  from  our  school
days, has seen a sharp  increase  in  productivity,  to  appoint  where  the
current rate of harvesting is estimated at 10 000 bags  of  citrus  fruit  a
day.

Let me jump to the work of the provinces in the area of ICT. I  have  spoken
about the role of Sita. The State Information Technology Agency has had  the
IT acquisition centre in place for one year. I believe that the  acquisition
centre is not working as well as it should. It has  made  a  start  and  has
managed to successfully adjudicate tenders  worth  R2,9  billion,  but  they
have not always met the targeted turnaround time of 45 days,  much  as  they
have learnt many lessons. The  Sita  board,  under  the  Chairpersonship  of
Zodwa Manase, must ensure that the turn around times are met,  and  that  I-
tech does what is required for Government. We are obviously  going  to  take
that forward. I recently initiated an investigation into to the awarding  of
tenders and other irregularities at Sita. These enquiries are  part  of  our
commitment as a Government, to accountability and  transparency.  We  didn't
need nudging from anyone. We looked at it because we felt that it needed  to
be looked at, and there is a course of action that has been dealt with.

The regulations to ensure that the provisions of the amendment of  the  Sita
Act is to be put in place, must be finalised.  This  will  ensure  that  all
acquisitions are  based  on  real  needs  and  are  done  fairly  and  cost-
effectively. I want to reflect on two provinces in terms of the  ICT  staff.
I will start with  the  Free  State.  The  Free  State  has  the  geographic
information system that is being developed to eliminate  duplicate  spending
on related geographic information. They are putting  in  place  the  central
repository  of  geographically  linked  business  information  available  in
provincial departments. The best status has been initiated, and the  project
is due for completion at the end of August  2003.  This  will  cost  in  the
region of half a million rands initially.

In the  Gauteng  province,  the  provincial  government  has  established  a
Gauteng Shared Services Centre. This is to streamlime all support  functions
across the 12 provincial departments. I know that the hon  members  of  this
House, from the Gauteng province, are aware that the shared services  budget
is being debated today. The functions of the  shared  services  include  the
elements  of  human  resource  and  financial   management,   as   well   as
procurement, internal audit and technology services.

The North West department of finance, on the other  hand,  has  initiated  a
number of projects, including the master systems plans, the installation  of
the debt collection system, a configuration of  management  policy,  a  wide
area network upgrade and a  web-based  information  system.  These  projects
involve an involvement an investment  of  approximately  R10  million.  This
information and  data  comes  from  the  Government  Information  Technology
Offices Council. They set and consist of  information  offices  from  across
Government departments.

I would like to conclude by speaking  about  our  anticorruption  work.  Our
anticorruption work extends to regional and international  co-operation.  It
takes place within SADC, the African Union  and  internationally.  The  DPSA
has for the past year, assisted the government of South  Korea  to  organise
and host the global forum three on  fighting  corruption  and  safe-guarding
integrity, a premier global gathering on  governments  fighting  corruption.
The global forum was held at the end of  last  month,  and  it  was  a  huge
success.
I  am  sure  there  may  be  one  or  two  minutes  left  to   speak   about
professionalism, regardless of rank. The public service is characterised  by
a commitment to operating professionally. In doing so,  our  human  resource
development  framework  seeks  to  establish  an  effective  and   efficient
internship programme to bridge the gap between academic study and  competent
performance in the workplace. It offers structured internship  opportunities
to students and unemployed youth to gain practical  work  experience  for  a
maximum of twelve months. We  have  made  a  commitment  that  about  5%  of
departments complements should constitute interns.  We  also  have  a  major
thrust on learnerships, but I am not going to bore you with that right now.

Let me just talk quickly  about  the  senior  managers  in  Government,  and
mention the fact that we focused on building a solid layer  there.  We  have
distinguished  this  particular  group,  and  we  have  now  completed   the
competency framework for the senior managers and are now  well  advanced  in
translating this into a developing programme for senior managers  that  will
allow us to co-ordinate and encourage skills  development  and  assist  with
recruitment and retention of senior managers.

I would really wrong this House if I don't refer to  a  specific  initiative
by some Samdi, and that is that Samdi will play a  clear  role  in  ensuring
that public servants have a broad span of skills and knowledge that  relates
not only to their core business, but also  to  management  and  supervision.
This is especially to true in  a  public  service  context  that  takes  the
rights  of  employers  seriously,  and  which  encourages  a   developmental
approach. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Thank  you,
Minister.  We  did  give  you  an  additional  two  minutes   to   conclude.
[Laughter.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members  and  guests,
the tide has indeed turned in the management  and  employment  practices  in
the Public Service. The notion that Government  provided  secure  employment
to  people  who  were  unskilled,  unmotivated  and  unaccountable  is  gone
forever. The turning of the tide has  been  so  dramatic  that  the  private
sector is no longer the sole custodian of good practice  when  it  comes  to
service delivery. If anything,  it  has  to  take  a  cue  from  the  Public
Service.

It has been the case, for instance, when the captains of  industry  realised
that corporate  governance,  as  one  of  their  crucial  tools  to  enforce
accountability, was sometimes hollow  and  blunt.  The  innovations  in  the
Public Service were made through  the  interwoven,  yet  programme-specific,
roles of the institutions supporting the Department of  Public  Service  and
Administration.

It is only a government that  has  imbibed  democracy  and  freedom  in  its
bowels and marrow that foresees an inherent  probability  of  governance  or
administration stagnation, and takes the necessary steps  to  put  in  place
checks and balances in partnership with the citizenry.

Our  interactions  with  the  Public  Service  Commission,   SA   Management
Development Institute and the State Information Technology Agency,  as  well
as the Seta in the Public Service, reveal that the office bearers and  staff
are not only in line, in some respect, with their respective  mandates,  but
are always planning ahead, innovating and actually walking the  extra  mile,
often far beyond their mandates.

The minority of public servants who still  displays  a  somewhat  lacklustre
approach in service rendering,  causes  one  to  wonder  why  they  are  not
influenced positively by  the  exciting  spirit  prevailing  in  the  public
sector. Some of these officials are those who narrow-mindedly cling  to  the
confines  of  a  job  description.  Transformation  entails,   inter   alia,
embracing, elaborating and innovation in implementing  the  stipulations  of
the statutes I mentioned. I'm sure these officers will heed the call by  the
Minister of Finance  -  ``to  do  the  right  thing  and  leave  the  Public
Service''.

As we proceed  to  make  headway  in  the  Public  Service  through  service
delivery  improvement,  the  integrated  human  resources   programme,   the
anticorruption   campaigns,   initiatives   and   recommendations   by   the
institutions  within  the  DPSA,  Regulation  7  and  other  mechanisms,  we
unfortunately still have to look over our shoulders  if  those  few  mundane
officials are still in the Public Service.

Transformation cannot be sufficiently stipulated in the Public Service  Act,
neither in the Code of Conduct for Public Servants, nor in the  departmental
handbooks,  and  also  not  in  the  Bill  of  Rights   enshrined   in   our
Constitution.

It pains one to be told by an official, for instance of Home  Affairs,  that
they are not adhering to Batho Pele principles. It  undermines  one's  pride
in the Public Service when one comes across officials  basking  in  the  sun
while starving mothers are  not  assisted  with  their  maintenance  moneys.
However, we are relieved to know that drastic action has been taken  against
those officials by the Department of Justice. We are,  surely,  not  in  the
business of hiring and firing, but we have a responsibility  to  the  public
at large to uphold a high level of service delivery.

Since  national  Government  delegates  some  of  its  functions  to   local
government, the issue regarding conditions of service, as raised by the  hon
Minister, becomes a crucial factor in  maintaining  service  delivery  norms
and standards. We are happy to note that remarkable headway  is  being  made
in this regard.

The additional responsibility on  the  department,  as  arising  from  South
Africa's role in the Nepad, as well as the African Union,  will  enable  the
department to share our initiatives and insights on public  management  with
our neighbours in the SADC region, the rest of  the  African  continent  and
the world at large. We stand taller than before, thanks to  your  leadership
and input in this regard, hon Minister.

The good work achieved in the public  sector  is  somewhat  muddied  by  the
scourge of corruption. We take note, however, of the various  mechanisms  to
prevent and deal with this  cancer  whenever  it  arises,  particularly  the
report by the Public Service Commission on blacklisting. We  are  challenged
to transcend the  recommendations  of  the  PSC  in  this  regard  to  local
government in order to assist  in  addressing  the  challenges  facing  that
sphere of government.

The circumstances leading to the appointment of the interim management  team
could best be described as a bursting of a festering abscess emanating  from
the wounds of apartheid. It is not only confined to the  Eastern  Cape,  but
extends to some other areas of our country as well, which had to endure  the
yoke of the former TVBC states. We are relieved, however, to note  the  good
lessons and initiatives that will be  used  in  other  areas,  as  has  been
highlighted by the interim management team.

We  hereby  voice  our  gratitude  and  appreciation  to  the   institutions
supporting the DPSA  for  their  kind  co-operation  and  support,  and  I'm
tempted to name them, but seeing that they are so numerous  I  dare  not  do
that now. Indeed, these men and women are  always  eager  to  enable  us  to
fulfil our role while not neglecting their own  roles.  We  thank  you  most
heartily for your commitment.

We still need to point out that with the  department  itself,  there  is  no
cause for concern whatsoever, except the need to  tighten  a  few  nuts  and
bolts here and there, then  we  will  be  going  faster.  We  also  wish  to
highlight the department's sterling work in maintaining peace and  stability
in public sector labour relations. We believe that the  tranquil  atmosphere
prevailing now augurs well for the ironing out of the  remaining  issues  in
the labour relations field.

Let us allow this department to proceed with the process  of  transformation
by supporting this Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  Y  GABRU  (Western  Cape):  Thank  you,  Mr  Deputy  Chairperson.  Madam
Minister, it's an honour and a privilege to take part in  this  debate  this
afternoon. I want to raise an issue in relation to the restructuring of  the
Civil Service. I'm doing this a  bit  reluctantly,  because  I  can  imagine
there must be hundreds of people who have come to you  to  plead  a  special
case for some group of workers. But I want to  plead  a  special  case  here
this afternoon. I realise full well that everywhere you  go  there  must  be
people who plead with you to look at a particular case.

My understanding is that Resolution 7 of 2002 has two phases, and  that  the
first phase comes to an end at the end of June. There  after,  in  phase  2,
there will be continued negotiations about it.

The issue I want to raise concerns my own  constituency,  the  Western  Cape
education department. In that department there are 1  023  noneducators  who
have been declared in excess.  Seventy  percent  of  them  come  from  rural
areas: Worcester, Beaufort West, and in some cases very small  places,  like
Noupoort. If anybody knows anything about it, they will  know  that  it's  a
very small town.

I would imagine that in many parts of the  country  there  are  these  small
towns. But there are some small towns in the Karoo where the  only  employer
in town is the Western Cape education department. There are  many  of  these
small towns, such as Murraysburg. Of these workers that I've mentioned,  30%
come from the category we call household aids, which in  effect  means  that
they are not very well paid either. I would be surprised if they  took  home
more than R1 500 a month.

Quite  often  in  these  towns,  there  are  very   few   other   employment
opportunities. In some of the towns, given  the  fact  that  it's  only  the
educational  institution,  maybe  the  hostel,  that  employed  them,   even
retraining is not going to do a lot for  them  to  get  employment  in  that
particular town. I spoke with  some  of  the  officials  in  our  department
yesterday, and they told to me that in some of the areas you  could  have  a
huge impact on the social structure of the town if 10 or 20 people  were  to
lose their jobs, because sometimes it would be difficult to redeploy them.

I was wondering, Madam Minister, if, when we were looking  at  second  phase
negotiations, we couldn't look at these kinds of issues  in  a  little  more
detail. Is  it  not  possible  to  work  out  what  the  cost  of  continued
employment  will  be  in  some  of  these  cases,  compared   to   that   of
redeployment, etc? My understanding is  that,  according  to  Resolution  7,
there is going to be a once-off payment of R25 000 if  you  are  retrenched,
and there is other funding being made available for retraining.  I  wondered
how much more it would cost to keep  people  in  these  jobs,  in  stead  of
redeploying them.

I said that I brought this issue  to  the  table  reluctantly,  because  I'm
absolutely sure, and the Minister has mentioned some of these cases  in  her
speech, that there must be lots of these issues all over  the  country.  But
be that as it may, I wonder if, when we are looking at phase two,  we  can't
look  at  the  smaller  towns  in  the   rural   areas   where   educational
institutions, or other government  institutions,  are  the  only  and  major
employer in such an area.

The second issue that I want  to  bring  to  the  table  again  concerns  my
constituency, the education area. I wondered if the Minister couldn't  raise
the issue again with the Minister of Education. A lot of people have made  a
big issue and complained about the fact that we want  to  take  away  powers
from school governing bodies. But I want to raise  an  issue  here  to  show
just how difficult it is to do some restructuring.

In the Southern Suburbs where, you will all  be  aware,  there  are  schools
that are, to put it mildly,  reasonably  privileged  in  relation  to  other
schools, there are some schools where they have 17 cleaners. Eleven of  them
have to be redeployed. They are in excess.  I  have  absolutely  no  problem
with that.

They have, however,  to  be  redeployed  to  places  like  Grassy  Park  and
Khayelitsha. What's happening in those areas, is that the  governing  bodies
are refusing to accept  them,  because  they  have  already  employed  other
people on contract labour. Now, the department, and I  must  say  that  it's
not often that I have sympathy for these departments, especially the one  in
the Western Cape, but the department is now caught in  a  bind.  It  doesn't
know what to do. It can't redeploy them, because the governing bodies  won't
accept them. It seems to me that we have to begin by looking  at  the  power
that they have to refuse  to  take  redeployed  noneducators,  so  that  the
department can give effect to the redeployment.

In the last minute or two, I want  take  the  opportunity,  once  again,  to
congratulate the Minister and her staff for  the  excellent  work  that  the
department does. What really impresses  more  than  anything  else,  is  the
whole question about public finance management on  line.  I  think  it's  an
absolutely excellent project, and I  was  just  wondering  and  hoping  that
maybe the Minister could extend this to Members of Parliament, so that  they
could also learn a bit more about finance on line. I thank you.
Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. When people are  at  work,  they
expect good results. Any employer expects his or her  employees  to  do  all
they can to improve production. In government service, public  servants  are
a mirror of that particular government. A person's face is  like  a  book  -
you can read happiness or anger.

In  my   province,   Limpopo,   we   had   to   integrate   four   different
administrations, that is the former Lebowa, Gazankulu, Venda  and  the  then
TPA (Transvaal Provincial Administration). It was not easy, but we  can  now
proudly say: We have arrived!

Integrating the four administrations,  we  had  to  deal  with  people  from
different backgrounds. Some felt the new Government was  expecting  miracles
from them. Some went on to say the new Government  was  abusing  them.  They
were saying all those things, because they were not used to the  Batho  Pele
principle. Those who were not prepared to adapt  had  to  jump  before  they
were pushed off, but the majority of them are now  doing  the  right  thing.
When you visit our government offices it  is  easy  to  detect  if  you  are
welcome, or if you are a sort of inconvenience.

We are not going to treat everybody alike.  We  want  to  thank  those  many
public servants who are leaving no stone unturned in making sure our  people
get a better service. We know those kind of officials are in  the  majority.
They are supportive, proactive, effective and positive.  They  are  prepared
to walk that extra mile and to even work overtime.  Please  note  that  what
you are doing will not go unnoticed.

However, the same cannot be said of public servants who will  give  you  the
necessary attention because of your standing or position in  the  community,
those who will give you their unqualified support  or  service  because  you
are good-looking, but who are not prepared to give service to  our  old  men
and women, because they look dirty. Those are the kind  of  public  servants
who tell our mothers and fathers to go and wash their hands before they  can
serve them, these types of officials or public servants  have  no  place  in
our Government. The sooner they leave the service, the better.
Another concern is corrupt officials, as rightly and correctly  put  by  the
hon Minister. They are not even ashamed to loot our  senior  citizens.  They
like harvesting where they did not sow. A public servant, who earns no  less
than R4 000 a month, would without thinking twice take a mere R700  from  an
old age pensioner. How unscrupulous are  those  public  servants  who  would
steal the mere R120 earmarked for a child support grant, and think of  those
unscrupulous public servants who are prepared  to  steal  the  mere  R300  a
mother should receive for the maintenance of her children. It  is  a  shame.
[Interjections.]

Hon Minister, these officials are so cunning, they will go to the extent  of
using another type of fingerprint  that  cannot  easily  be  traced  by  any
detective or investigator. Let us flush them out of the system.  Some  will,
after being discovered,  resign  and  form  private  consultancy  firms.  My
problem is that it is so discouraging to realise that some departments  make
use of those firms that  belong  to  those  officials,  who  were  fired  or
resigned because of them being corrupt. If there is a way  of  stopping  it,
let us please do it now, before it is too late. If I wanted to be  harsh,  I
would have suggested that they should be blacklisted. It is discouraging  to
find some of these officials back in the public service.

Another concern is those officials who have  reached  a  ceiling.  They  are
untrainable and not transformable. For that matter, even the many  workshops
your departments have are unable to change them. It is  very  difficult  for
them to adjust to the new ways of doing things. My  honest  belief  is  that
this Government is no longer interested in quantity,  but  in  quality.  Can
the hon Minister do something about this?

I will feel bad if I cannot raise this concern, but I take  it  through  you
to the department. I still cannot believe or understand why  the  department
refused to come and brief the select committee about their budget. We  tried
several times, through our chairperson, to invite his officials to come  and
brief us, but in vain. The committee sat  on  Monday,  this  week,  but  the
officials never turned up. Hon Minister, something must be done about this.

My thanks go to the Public Service Commission, Sita and Samdi  which  deemed
it fit and proper to come down, even if it was stooping low,  they  did  it,
they came to brief the committee. But not officials  from  your  department,
hon Minister. I wonder  why.  I  have  been  informed  that  the  very  same
officials managed to brief the  portfolio  committee,  but  not  the  select
committee. [Interjections.]

The select committee was told they can only get  a  briefing  after  today's
debates. I wonder if these officials understand  that  these  briefings  are
not optional. Members must know what those moneys, allocated  to  particular
departments, go to.

Maybe one day we will be told why  it  was  not  important  for  the  select
committee to be briefed before this debate. Hon Minister,  we  now  rely  on
you to knock sense into these officials. Briefings are not a luxury,  but  a
bare necessity. Nobody is doing us  a  favour  when  they  comply  with  our
request for a briefing. I know the Minister will tell the  House  about  the
role the department is playing on  the  continent,  and  even  in  SADC,  in
assisting some countries, in making  sure  their  administration  is  up  to
scratch.

I know there are countries that look at us, as a  country,  for  assistance.
By the same score, I was made aware  that  there  are  many  officials  from
other countries who are working in many  of  our  departments.  However,  we
have to find out whether these officials  are  doing  specialised  jobs,  or
whether they are doing ordinary jobs that can be done by our own  people  in
South Africa. If they are bringing in specialised skills we do  not  have  a
problem with them. We then support them working here.

Hon Minister, thank you very much for availing yourself to  come  and  brief
this Council. I hope and believe your officials will  follow  your  example.
Thank you very much.

Mnr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, voordat ek hierdie toespraak lewer, wil  ek  my
aansluit by die vorige spreker. Ek het my afgevra: verstaan ek die  Grondwet
reg? Is my grondwetlike vertolking reg?  Hierdie  departement,  waaroor  ons
vandag hier debat voer, het in bykans vier jaar slegs twee keer  die  gekose
komitee kom spreek. Ons praat daarom vandag hier oor 'n vreemdeling.

Wat ek vandag hier in my toespraak kan noem, is te danke aan  die  feit  dat
ek die portefeuljekomitee se sittings bygewoon het om in die pas te kom  met
die funksies van hierdie departement.

Dit is vir my aangenaam om vandag hier deel te neem aan die  debat  oor  die
begrotingspos van die Departement van die Staatsdiens en Administrasie.

Daar  dien  vermeld  te  word  dat  hierdie  begroting   diensleweringsgerig
opgestel is om sodoende die funksionering  van  staatsdepartemente  glad  te
laat verloop, nasionaal sowel as provinsiaal. Menslike hulpbronne is tot  'n
ver gevorderde stadium ontwikkel, wat in die praktyk beteken dat  informasie
van 'n hoë gehalte beskikbaar is om sodoende departemente in staat  te  stel
om effektiewe dienslewering moontlik te maak. Dit is  daarom  onverstaanbaar
dat departemente so, male sonder tal, vasval, en soms nie  daarin  slaag  om
diens van gehalte te lewer nie. 'n Voorbeeld hiervan is die Departement  van
Binnelandse Sake. Hierdie departement bepaal die  kom  en  gaan  van  mense,
maar is so vasgevang in administratiewe probleme dat dienslewering soms  nie
tot sy reg kom nie.

Die vraag kan gevra word: watter metodiek word gebruik om inligting deur  te
gee, en watter meganisme is beskikbaar om te sorg dat departemente op  koers
is en binne die raamwerk van dienslewering opereer?

'n Ander aspek wat ook dringend aandag verg, is dié van plaaslike  regering,
gesien die feit dat menige plaaslike owerheid  administratief  nie  die  mas
opkom nie. Dit sal die Departement  van  die  Staatsdiens  en  Administrasie
baat om in hierdie verband ook munisipaliteite te voorsien van inligting  en
opleiding, veral  op  die  bestuursvlak,  om  sodoende  te  sorg  dat  goeie
dienslewering sy beslag kry op die grondvlak.

As ons geluister  het  na  wat  die  Minister  gesê  het  van  Sita  en  die
ontwikkeling waarmee gevorder is sover dit  inligting  betref,  sal  dit  'n
kwade dag wees as departemente voortploeter op die ou  prinsiep,  terwyl  so
baie inligting en hulpbronne tot hul beskikking is.

Wat ook verder kommerwekkend is,  is  die  feit  dat  salarisse  in  al  die
departemente se begrotings meer as 45% absorbeer.  Effektiewe  dienslewering
word  sodoende  verskraal,   en   baie   van   die   projekte   word   slegs
teeninskrywings wat nooit  realiseer  nie,  as  gevolg  van  'n  tekort  aan
finansies. Hierdie bose kringloop sal drasties beredder moet word.

Ek bedoel nie dat  werknemers  se  salarisse  nie  moet  tred  hou  met  die
inflasiekoers  nie,  maar  'n  goed  betaalde  werkerskorps  moet  gewis  'n
teenprestasie lewer by wyse van diens van  gehalte.  Dit  is  tans  nie  die
geval nie. Die praktyk spreek vanself.
Vir die staatsamptenare wat goeie diens lewer, wat hard werk,  baie  dankie.
Dit word gewaardeer. Vir hierdie  staatsamptenare  wat  hard  werk,  wil  ek
aanhaal wat Longfellow sê:


  Die leiers op die hoogste trap
  het nie gestyg met enkele stap;
  wyl ander slaap en droom,
  het hul gewerk tot oggendsoon.

Ten slotte wil ek sê dit is 'n weldeurdagte begroting, en  die  moeite  werd
om te steun, aldus die Nuwe NP. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, before  I  deliver  this  speech,  I  wish  to
associate myself with the previous  speaker.  I  have  asked  myself:  Do  I
understand the Constitution correctly? Is my  constitutional  interpretation
correct? This department about which we are debating  here  today  has  only
visited the select committee twice in almost four years.  We  are  therefore
talking about a stranger here today.
What I want to raise in my speech here today is thanks to the  fact  that  I
attended the meetings of the portfolio committee, to come familiar with  the
functions of this department. It is a pleasure for  me  to  take  part  here
today in the debate on the Budget Vote of the Department of  Public  Service
and Administration.

It deserves to be mentioned that this budget was  drafted  with  a  view  to
service delivery  in  so  doing  to  allow  the  functioning  of  government
departments to run smoothly,  nationally  as  well  as  provincially.  Human
resources have developed to a greatly  advances  stage,  which  in  practice
means that information of a high  quality  is  available  so  as  to  enable
government departments to make effective service delivery  possible.  It  is
therefore impossible to understand that departments time  and  again  become
bogged down, and sometimes do not succeed in rendering quality services.  An
example  of  this  is  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs.  This  department
determines  the  coming  and  going  of  people,  but  is  so  entangled  in
administrative problems that service delivery sometimes does not  come  into
its own.

The question may be put: What method is used to  pass  on  information,  and
what mechanism is in place to ensure that  departments  are  on  course  and
operating within the profile of service delivery?

Another aspect that also requires in-depth attention  is  local  government,
in view of the fact that many a local authority fails  administratively.  It
will stand the Department of the Public Service and Administration  in  good
stead in this regard also to provide  municipalities  with  information  and
training, especially at management level, in so doing to ensure  that  sound
service delivery finds effect at the grassroots level.

If  we  have  listened  to  what  the  Minister  said  about  Sita  and  the
development, with which progress has been made with regard  to  information,
it would be a bad day if departments plodded  on  along  the  old  principle
while there is so much information and resources at their disposal.
What furthermore gives cause for concern is the fact that  salaries  in  all
the departments absorb over 45%. effective  service  delivery  is  therefore
diminished, and many of the projects just  become  contra-entries  that  are
never realised owing to a lack of funds. This vicious circle  will  have  to
be dealt with dramatically.

I do not  mean  that  employees'  salaries  should  not  keep  up  with  the
inflation rate, but a well-paid workers' corps should  certainly  produce  a
return on this by rendering a quality service. And this is  not  at  present
the case. Practice speaks for itself.

To government officials who render a good  service,  work  hard:  Thank  you
very much. It is appreciated. And to these  government  officials  who  work
hard, I want to convey what Longfellow says:


  The leaders on the highest step
  did not rise with single tread
  while others sleep and dream
  they worked till morning gleam.
In conclusion, it is a well-considered  budget,  and  worth  supporting,  so
says the New NP.]

Mr  I  SEGALO  (Free  State):  Chairperson,  during  July  1994,  with   the
establishment of one  Public  Service  for  South  Africa,  the  Free  State
government inherited approximately  35  600  posts  from  the  ex-provincial
administration  of  the  Orange  Free  State,  the  ex-Qwaqwa  and  the  ex-
Bophuthatswana administrations. This excluded education, which was  devolved
to the province during 1995. After merging the above  inherited  structures,
all serving officials were rationalised on 28 February  1996,  in  terms  of
the provisions of Chapter B (Special) of  the  Public  Service  Staff  Code,
resulting in 4929 serving officials being placed supernumerary to  the  post
establishment of the province.

Owing to a moratorium placed  on  employer-initiated  retrenchments  by  the
national Government, said supernumerary officials could, up and  until  now,
not be retrenched. I  should  also  mention  that  these  merged  structures
actually represented an amalgamated structure at the  time.  Rationalisation
in the true sense of the word did not take place. Rationalisation only  took
place after the rationalisation of human  resources  was  finalised,  taking
into account the needs of the  respective  departments  in  terms  of  their
legal mandates and the needs of the community of the Free State province.

Functions being devolved by the national Government, as  well  as  functions
having to be created anew in terms of the legislation were also  taken  into
account during the rationalisation process.  Funds  were  only  received  in
terms of functions or posts  being  devolved  by  national  Government.  For
functions and posts to be created anew, the province had  to  provide  funds
for those functions from existing  budgets.  During  the  end  of  the  1996
financial year, officials from the Departments of State Expenditure  and  of
Public  Service  and  Administration,  visited  the   province   to   obtain
commitments for the abolition of funded vacancies  and  voluntary  severance
package posts.

The province subsequently contributed a total amount of  approximately  R157
million to the rightsizing process. It is the understanding of our  province
that Resolution 7 partly attempted to try and address the problem of  excess
staff, that is by absorbing excess staff in equivalent graded posts  in  the
Public Service, prior to retrenching them. The province is in line with  the
target dates prescribed in Resolution 7.

The provincial IDTT was subsequently established  to  monitor  the  process,
and to report  to  the  Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration
thereon, comprising of human resource representatives  from  all  provincial
departments to monitor the process. To date all provincial departments  have
finalised   their   restructuring   exercises   and   provided   lists    of
advertisements regarding vacancies for  purposes  of  advertisements  within
the public service, thereby affording excess staff a  chance  to  apply  for
such posts.

Each provincial department  in  the  Free  State  has  developed  a  service
delivery improvement programme,  addressing  all  the  principles  of  Batho
Pele, to ensure improved service  delivery  to  the  community.  Information
lines and help desks established in  the  provincial  departments,  and  the
issuing of newsletters to the community include a number of  innovations  in
improving  communication  between  Government  and  the  community,  thereby
contributing to service delivery.

In enhancing improved delivery of services to the community, the  Government
entered  into  service  level  agreements   with   a   number   of   service
organisations.  An  example  in  this  regard  is   the   establishment   of
multipurpose community centres in remote areas in the Free  State  province.
These  centres  ensure  that  an  integrated  service  is  rendered  to  the
communities by a number of  national  and  provincial  departments  bringing
service to the communities.

The executive committee resolved  on  19  March  2003  that  the  provincial
government continues to make use of the transversal  systems  maintained  by
Sita. All provincial departments, in future, closely interact with  Sita  on
matters  related  to  telecommunications  infrastructure.  If  a  provincial
department is not able to render a service listed as a  ``may''  service  in
Section 7(1)(b) of the Sita Amendment Act of 2002, with  internal  capacity,
it must approach Sita to either render or procure the service on  behalf  of
such a department.

In line with the stipulations of Sections 3 and  4  of  the  Sita  Amendment
Act, provincial departments procure  all  information  technology  goods  or
services through Sita. The business agreement  that  was  concluded  between
the province and Sita on 14 September 2000 must be reviewed to  include  the
stipulations of the Sita Amendment Act,  Act  38  of  2002,  and  the  above
resolutions.

Progress in ensuring that the  province  participate  in  the  Sita  service
level agreement is thus well underway.  According  to  the  1996  population
census, our province has an  estimated  total  population  of  2,63  million
people,  which  makes  it  the  smallest  provincial  population  after  the
Northern Cape. Eighty four per cent of the Free State population consist  of
black people, 12% whites, 3% coloureds, and 0,11% Indians.

With   increasing   unemployment,   families,   especially   female   headed
households, people in the rural areas, the disabled, the  youth  and  others
who have special needs, have become increasingly  vulnerable.  Because  they
have no security and sustainable  livelihoods,  they  turn  to  the  welfare
system for income, maintenance and  social  support.  In  seeking  to  apply
itself to these challenges and opportunities, the provincial Strategic  Plan
was developed by the province in February 2000.

The fundamental purpose of this plan  is  to  align  departmental  strategic
plans  with  the  view  to  produce  a  global  provincial  plan  that  will
positively  alter  the  socioeconomic  patterns   of   the   province.   The
implementation  of  the  Free  State  Development  Plan  is  dealt  with  in
partnership with the private sector in the Free State  province.  IDPs  from
local authorities are also aligned with the said plans.

Let me also say that  there  is  considerable  progress  when  it  comes  to
developing  the  Free  State  provincial   government   into   a   competent
professional and ethical public service. Examples in  this  regard  are  the
following.  The  development  of  a  departmental  workplace  skills   plan,
identifying and addressing the training needs of officials in  the  province
and the establishment of the Free State Training and Development  Management
Institute that ensures that effective  and  needs-based  transverse  generic
training programmes are made available to officials. In this  regard  1%  of
the budgets of departments is allocated for the  development  of  officials.
Departments  also  allocate  bursaries  to   officials   for   purposes   of
development and retention, and to people from  outside  the  public  service
for purposes of recruitment.

Another example is the development and implementation of a  performance  and
development management system from levels 1-12, which, amongst  others,  has
the following objectives: To establish a performance  and  learning  culture
in the public service, to ensure that all  jobholders  know  and  understand
what  is  expected  of  them,  to  promote  contact  and  interaction  about
performance  between  jobholders  and  their  supervisors  and  to  evaluate
performance fairly and objectively.

The above-mentioned PDMS is also being translated into Abet level  by  means
of the IPSP programme, ensuring accessibility to illiterate and lower  level
graded officials. The development and management of  performance  agreements
for  all  HODs  as  well  as  SMS  members  in  the  province,  ensure  that
performance of HODs and SMS members are managed in line  with  predetermined
objectives.

Various key corporate matters have also been dealt  with  in  our  province.
The following are examples: Management plans  have  been  developed  by  all
departments in the Free State provincial government; comprising  of  service
delivery improvement programmes,  strategic  plans,  human  resource  plans,
etc, so as to shape services to meet customer needs. Departmental  strategic
plans have been aligned with the Free State Development Plan.
A provincial human resource  development  strategy  has  been  developed  in
consultation with all provincial departments. The  said  strategy  has  been
developed according to  the  unique  needs  of  the  Free  State  provincial
government, and within the parameters set  in  the  White  Paper  on  Public
Service,  Training  and  Education,  addressing  various   human   resources
policies like recruitment, appointment and transfer.

The establishment of various special  programmes,  that  is  youth,  gender,
disability ... [Interjections.] Sabotage! [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired. It is  not
sabotage. [Laughter.] [Applause.] When your microphone  goes  off  you  must
know your time has expired.

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you Chairperson. Let  me  start  by
giving credit where credit is due. The hon Minister and her department  must
be complimented for having brought the  Department  of  Public  Service  and
Administration  through  the  phases  of  amalgamation,  transformation  and
rightsizing to where we are today. Having said  that,  we  in  KwaZulu-Natal
will point out a number of areas and  issues  that  need  serious  attention
before we can claim we have a truly efficient and effective Public  Service.
Please  take  our  comments  as  being  constructive,  and  not  merely   as
criticism.

Firstly, I will very briefly touch on four areas of concern. First  of  all,
it is our concern that we have  an  overregulated  system,  one  which  also
changes far too frequently. We have a plethora of laws to deal with  in  our
civil service, such as the Public  Service  Act,  the  Basic  Conditions  of
Employment Act, the Employment Equity Act, Public Service Regulations,  DPSA
Policy and Guidelines, PACBC Resolutions and the Code of Conduct  -  a  real
minefield. In each instance, each of these needs to be read  in  conjunction
with the other to just understand the principles.

Coupled with that, is the fact that there are constant  changes  coming  up,
which makes the system certainly not user-friendly  to  our  administrators,
especially the  managers  and  their  administration.  The  change  that  is
required here is that the Departments of Public Service  and  Administration
and of Labour need to reduce the frequency of changes  that  come  about  in
these laws, norms and standards to  allow  departments  to  understand  this
system which has been passed on to them, and to  consolidate  and  implement
the laws  and  guidelines.  This  will  allow  departments  enough  time  to
effectively manage and implement our labour laws in  line  with  Batho  Pele
standards.

Secondly, another area of concern is the nonalignment of local  governments'
salary system with the provincial salary system. The provincial  one  is  in
fact aligned to the national  norms  and  standards.  Local  government  and
municipalities have a very different structure. This creates a  problem  for
us in the provinces with regards to staff retention, and the  high  turnover
of staff.

There are times when we in the provinces feel that we are  trying  to  build
our own administrative capacity on no more than a training ground for  staff
for local government and, in some instances, national departments.  We  feel
that this critical problem should be addressed by legislation. The  proposed
Public Administration  Management  Act,  which  is  to  replace  the  Public
Service Act, needs to address this problem effectively. The idea that  local
governments, as the third sphere of Government, should  be  operating  on  a
separate system is not acceptable. We would like  to  see  the  same  labour
laws and  salary  determinations  that  apply  to  provincial  and  national
Government applied to local government  in  order  to  ensure  stability  of
staff.

The third issue is resolution of  intergovernmental  disputes.  The  dispute
resolution within the three spheres of Government  need  to  be  managed  by
legislation. In terms of  Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution,  the  different
spheres  of  Government  ought  to  adopt  legislation  to  manage   dispute
resolution in crisis management. This legislation has not yet been  adopted.
For example, we in  KwaZulu-Natal,  had  the  R293  properties,  which  were
transferred to municipalities in terms of  legislation.  However,  up  until
now, we still sit with staff  from  the  293  towns,  which  have  not  been
transferred to municipalities, or even in some cases  national  departments,
to whom they render services.

The problem comes about because local  government  and  municipalities,  and
national department in many cases, are unwilling to accept these  employees,
because they know that there are no adequate mechanisms for  the  management
of disputes that arise in the area of  these  relationships.  Therefore,  if
Government departments ought to avoid taking each other  to  court,  in  the
spirit  of  co-operative  and  good  governance,  it   is   essential   that
legislative guidelines be provided to maintain this cordial support and  co-
operative system of Government in  resolving  disputes  and  building  Batho
Pele principles within the Public Service.

Finally, the fourth point we would like to raise relates  to  Resolution  7.
The process of Resolution 7 has been very  difficult  to  comply  with.  The
employment of  excess  employees  is  greatly  resisted  by  most  managers,
because they believe ... [Time expired.]

Mr  T  RALANE:  Chairperson,  I  want  to  constructively  remind  both   my
colleagues, Mr Aulsebrook and Mr Horne, that we yesterday had a briefing  on
the intergovernmental fiscal  review.  The  intergovenmental  fiscal  review
states that expenditures, provincially  and  nationally,  are  estimated  at
18%. The issue that Mr Aulsebrook has  raised  is  incorrect.  Secondly,  in
terms of the capacity of municipalities, that matter is  taken  care  of  in
the Division of Revenue Act. There is a whole range  of  conditional  grants
which seek to assist municipalities. This  department  is  going  to  assist
where it is required to assist.

We have been reminded by the Minister of Education  that  KZN  is  the  only
province that has so far had more than five MECs for Education.  Maybe  this
is one of the concerns the member must also address when he raises  some  of
these kinds of financial problems. The  other  problem  that  also  emanates
from that province has to do with the huge  number  of  people  they  always
bring to the NCOP as special delegates. They would come in  fours,  in  twos
or in eights, to only one debate. It is  a  matter  that  also  has  serious
financial implications that that province must address. [Laughter.]

The RDP states that South  Africa  has  a  large  public  sector  with  many
resources. The public sector consists of the  Public  Service,  the  police,
the defence force ...

Mr J AULSBROOK: Chairperson, on a point of  order:  What  my  colleague  has
said there is not relevant to what I said.

Mr T RALANE: Chair, he has really wasted  my  time.  I  hope  you  have  not
counted that minute. The staffing levels in, and budgetary  allocations  to,
Government departments and institutions  must  match  the  requirements  for
service delivery  and  operational  requirements  for  women's  empowernment
within the constraints of the budget. A definite quota of all new  employees
should come from groups that were disadvantaged on the  basis  of  race  and
gender.
All employees should be given access to  appropriate  training  and  support
systems. This should be evaluated each year to determine the  progress  made
and to identify problems which arise.  By  the  turn  of  the  century,  the
personnel composition of the public sector, including parastatal, must  have
changed to reflect the  national  distribution  of  race  and  gender.  Such
progress will enhance the full utilisation of  the  country's  labour  power
and productivity.

What is the state of affairs as we approach the  tenth  anniversary  of  our
liberation? A Public Service Commission has been appointed with the  mandate
of dealing with issues of  appointments  and  of  promoting  efficiency  and
effectiveness in departments. The  Public  Service  Commission  has  already
established a code  of  conduct  for  the  Public  Service,  and  introduced
programmes  of  affirmative  action  and  other  appropriate  techniques  to
eliminate inequities in employment.

The ethos created by the Code of Conduct  is  that  of  professionalism  and
inculcating the principle and practice of serving the people. Owing  to  the
realities of the country's discriminatory history, the DPSA had to  move  in
great strides to address the inequities of the past in the  Public  Service.
Key successes in this regard may be summarised  as  follows:  Transformation
and restructuring of the Public Service ensured the protection and  creation
of quality employment within the Public Service. In  addition,  it  improved
delivery of services  to  the  community,  enhancing  the  productivity  and
performance of the  Public  Service  to  meet  national  objectives.  It  is
conducted in a joint, open and consultative way amongst all stakeholders.

It ensured that the redeployment of personnel would take place in  terms  of
the  job  summit  framework  and  in  terms  of  further  agreements  to  be
negotiated in the PSCB. Furthermore, it  ensured  that  the  Public  Service
remained the provider of services that constitute the social wage  in  order
to  meet  the  needs  of  the  poor  and  also  provide  a  foundation   for
development. More importantly, it improved the skills  base  of  the  Public
Service, and ensured that the Public Service remained the  primary  resource
for such training. Moreover, it enhanced greater equity in the  distribution
of incomes and wealth.

The Government inherited a Public Service which was strongly  influenced  by
discriminatory employment policies and practices based on race,  gender  and
disability, hence these groups are  poorly  represented  at  decision-making
levels, and  in  other  technical  occupational  classes.  The  Constitution
identifies representativeness of the Public  Service  as  one  of  the  main
conditions of a nonracist, nonsexist and democratic society that  integrates
people with disabilities.

When the Government came into power in 1994, initiatives were put  in  place
to remove discriminatory practices  and  policies  in  employment.  Measures
were also developed as an interim  arrangement  to  facilitate  and  promote
accessibility to the Public Service for all. The White Paper on  Affirmative
Action was a testimony of the Government's commitment to the  transformation
of the Public Service into an institution  where  employment  practices  are
underpinned by equity.

In addition, the DPSA published the White Paper  on  Affirmative  Action  in
the Public Service  in  South  Africa  in  Sesotho,  IsiZulu,  Xitsonga  and
Afrikaans on the Internet with effect from 30  September  1998.  This  is  a
progressive  move  towards  the  recognition  of  multilingualism  in  South
Africa. The papers mentioned accountability, monitoring  and  the  reporting
of  responsibilities  of  the  various  players  within  affirmative  action
programmes.

The purpose of the paper was to provide a policy  framework  that  sets  out
the  mandatory  requirements  and  steps  that  national   departments   and
provincial administrations  should  take  to  develop  and  implement  their
affirmation action programmes. Subsequent to the affirmative action  policy,
the Government decided to introduce the Employment  Equity  Bill.  This  was
necessitated by ... [Time Expired.] [Applause.]

The ANC supports the Vote.
Ms G  N  SWAARTBOOI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  the  tide  has  turned.
``Build a people's contract for a better South Africa'', that is what  I  am
saying to the hon Minister, Mrs Fraser-Moleketi. Malibongwe! [Praise!].

Ever since our country was democratised in 1994, Government has made  steady
progress in ensuring that it continues with its mandate to create  a  better
life for all South Africans. Our challenge as the Government is to focus  on
sustaining and speeding up the progress. The Minister's speech  is  striving
to do just that. The foundation has been laid in the first five years,  when
more emphasis  was  on  restructuring  and  policy-making.  In  this  second
democratic term of governance  there  has  been  a  shift  to  more  service
delivery and policy-implementation. The tide has turned.  Build  a  people's
contract for a better South Africa.

In order for the Government to sustain and speed  up  the  progress,  it  is
important for public servants to demonstrate a  practical  understanding  of
procedures, directions and instructions contained in the Code of Conduct  if
effective service delivery is to reach the  citizens  of  our  country.  The
Code of Conduct for Public Servants was promulgated in 1997 with the aim  of
providing public servants with guidelines on the behaviour expected of  them
in the course of their duties.

However, as the Government, we are still faced with the  challenge  of  some
officials  who  do  not  promote  and  maintain  the   high   standards   of
professional ethics in the Public Service. They  continue  to  take  offers,
gifts or bribes. There are a lot of  fraudulent  activities  and  corruption
taking place. Those responsible are from the most junior to the most  senior
officials in all departments.

To be specific,  in  KwaZulu-Natal  the  officials  of  social  welfare  and
services  are  the  most  corrupt.  They  work  in  collaboration  with  the
officials  of  Home  Affairs  and  district  surgeons.  There  will  be  two
different people with the same ID number, like in  the  case  of  a  certain
applicant by the name of Mrs Marriet Khumalo who lives  in  Gamalakhe,  Port
Shepstone. This applicant applied for an old age pension in September  2000.
But to date she does not get her pension, instead  another  person  who  has
the same ID number, who lives at G419 in  Umlazi,  is  getting  the  pension
with the same ID number that belongs to Mrs Khumalo.

At Tongaat one  finds  people  sleeping  outside  welfare  offices  in  long
queues. It was reported in our  last  welfare  portfolio  Committee  meeting
that in order for these people to be assisted in whatever form,  they  first
have to fork out a sum of R20. It has been reported to me  that  in  Umzinto
district surgeons work with welfare officials, and as a result, most of  the
people who get disability grants do not have any  disabilities,  and  people
who are really permanently disabled are not able to access the  grant.  This
is very unfair. I do not know when people will realise  that  the  tide  has
turned and that we should build a  people's  contract  for  a  better  South
Africa.

The Code of Conduct has to be popularised, and each official should  have  a
copy of the explanatory manual of  the  Code  of  Conduct  produced  by  the
Public Service Commission. Secondly, the challenge that each department  has
to face is to ensure that the principles, as  outlined  in  the  Batho  Pele
White Paper, are adhered to by the  officials  so  that  the  needs  of  our
people can be placed first and be satisfied.

In conclusion,  we  wish  to  commend  all  officials  who  are  engaged  in
promoting the Code of Conduct, and who are committed to  respect  the  Batho
Pele principles. They must keep up the good work,  and  never  give  up  the
challenge of promoting an ethos of professionalism in  the  Public  Service.
Forward South Africans with a better life for all. Afrika ke  nako.  [Africa
it is time.] The tide has turned.  Build  a  contract  for  a  better  South
Africa. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chair of  Chairs,  hon  Minister,  hon  members  and
distinguished guests, I wish to take this opportunity  to  congratulate  the
hon Minister for her forthright and open  approach  to  the  challenges  and
problems facing  her  department.  It  is  often  forgotten,  sometimes  for
reasons of political comfort or opportunism, that the task  of  transforming
South Africa's Public Service is  a  massive  and  complex  one.  It  was  a
massive challenge to transform our administration, or create a new one,  and
at the same  time  seek  and  develop  resources  to  deliver  services  and
infrastructure to the electorate.

I still remember my visit to one of the offices in 1994. I sat in the  queue
with the people  I  found  there,  and  listened  to  them  complaining  and
grumbling. There were two ladies who had been there for two days.  They  had
been waiting on the bench the whole of the previous day  and  had  to  leave
that afternoon without having been helped. They complained that  there  were
only three days left for them to finalise the burial arrangements  of  their
loved one, and they had not been helped yet. I was going to  sit  there  and
come the following day, but because of the problem that these people had,  I
had to intervene.

I went into the office and there I found a group of clerks with  their  feet
on the desk. They just gave me one dirty look,  and  then  they  carried  on
with their conversation. I stood and looked at them,  and  then  they  asked
me: "Yes, can we help you?" I was not planning on telling them  who  I  was,
but I had to, just because I wanted them to help those people.

I told them: There are people that have been coming here for  two  days  and
you have not helped them. When do you intend helping them?  They  looked  at
me and probably thought: Who do you think you are? [Interjections.]  Then  I
said to them: By the way, I am a member of Parliament in Cape Town. I  am  a
senator - the second House was then still the Senate. Then they  jumped  up.
[Laughter.] I do not know what happened to the others,  but  the  one  whose
office that was had nowhere to go. He had to face me.  Then  only  did  they
help those people. But today, I must say, I am very proud there is a  great,
great change. Those things are not happening any more.

I am very grateful, Minister, to our Government for the  change,  but  today
we are faced with challenges of integration.  Transformation  cannot  happen
overnight. The movement towards a more  integrated  governance  approach  to
the work of the Department of Public  Service  and  Administration  and  the
enhanced pressures arising from integrated governance responsibilities  have
created additional policy and integrated capability demands. It  has  become
necessary to  focus  additional  capabilities  at  the  strategic  corporate
centre of the Department of Public Service and Administration.

Resolution 7 of 2002 is an agreement between the state, as an employer,  and
the Public Service trade unions on the transformation and  restructuring  of
the Public Service. Resolution 7 will resolve the problem  of  inappropriate
deployment  of  staff,  while  increasing  productivity  and  ensuring   the
delivery of better quality public services. It will also  identify  lack  of
skills within the Public Service.

The State Information Technology  Agency  -  Sita  -  is  now  well  set  to
effectively integrate and co-ordinate government  information  systems,  and
the Independent Public  Service  Commission  has  grown  into  its  role  of
monitoring and evaluating the Public Service, promoting a high  standard  of
professional ethics in the Public Service and undertaking investigations.  I
had an argument with the people of Sita. I told them I have  not  seen  them
in the Northern Cape. I wanted to know when they had  visited  the  Northern
Cape, because they had so much to tell us on what they  had  done,  but  one
does not see what they had done. I told them that I would go and check.

Corporate services  have  historically  been  a  fairly  dispersed  function
within the  Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration,  and  have
historically been a very  human  capital  intensive  operational  area.  The
centre of Public Service Innovations' work is showing us  that  we  need  to
consider one Public Service in terms of policy and systems  that  uses  one-
stop centres such as multipurpose community centres staffed by  multiskilled
public servants. The Minister has already mentioned such a  one-stop  centre
at Galeshewe. I must say it is of great help to our people.

An HON MEMBER: ... and in Colesberg.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: ... and in Colesberg.  Our  Constitution  requires  that  a
single Public Service be promoted, and we must, therefore, review  each  and
every request critically. For this purpose the Department of Public  Service
and Administration has established a joint panel with national Treasury.

Lastly, provinces have  a  very  important  role  to  play.  The  Integrated
Provincial Support Programme remains the Department of  Public  Service  and
Administration's partnership with provinces and  select  donors  to  improve
service delivery. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the  hon  Minister  and  colleagues,  the  Deputy
Chair gave the hon Minister an extra two minutes, which I think was  because
of her charm, and not because of her slow watch. I hope I can have the  same
effect on the Chair, even if it is not today. Perhaps I can bank  it  for  a
later occasion. [Laughter.] I do not know if it will help if I  say  the  DA
supports this vote.
Hon Minister, the hon Kgosi Mokoena and the hon Mkhaliphi have made  certain
points with which I associate myself, and I won't repeat  them.  I  am  sure
you are aware, hon Minister, that as a second House, the NCOP  likes,  as  a
part of its oversight obligations, to visit  the  points  at  which  service
delivery takes place. I appreciate that much of this is  anecdotal,  but  we
hope the hon Minister gets our  reports.  Together  with  other  sources  of
information available to her, it should assist  to  build  a  more  accurate
picture of this state of affairs  in  the  Public  Service.  Because  it  is
anecdotal, hon Minister, it would not be fair to  cite  specific  cases  and
expect you to respond to them in this debate. Suffice  it  to  say  that  we
have seen the very worst, including allegations of corruption,  as  well  as
the very best, which includes  individuals  who  have  taken  the  ethos  of
service delivery to heart and who clearly live, eat and  breathe  the  ethos
of service delivery. We  have  also  seen  every  shade  of  public  servant
between these two extremes.

One of  the  challenges  you  face,  hon  Minister,  is  to  keep  the  good
individuals who are precious to our country, and to rid us  of  the  corrupt
officials. Why do we, as the DA, support this budget vote?  We  do  so,  hon
Minister, because we  have  seen  that  the  department  has  put  in  place
management tools to facilitate  delivery  of  services  and  to  limit,  and
progressively eliminate, corruption. Certainly  there  are  challenges.  The
hon Minister herself has acknowledged this. In considering whether  we  will
support next year's budget,  hon  Minister,  we  will  be  looking  for  the
improved outcomes from the implementation of these management tools.

Hon  Minister,  you  have  also  shown  great  courage,  which  I  wish   to
acknowledge, in the negotiating of  the  multiyear  wage  packages  for  the
public sector. It is very topical and very recent that the latest  has  been
announced where the public sector has been awarded - I am  told  -  9,5%.  I
believe it was announced today if I am not mistaken. However, Minister,  and
you are not responsible  for  this,  but  I  am  sure  you  are  aware  that
Statistics SA has provided misleading information. I  make  the  assumption,
and perhaps you will correct me if I am wrong, that the negotiation  of  the
current wage package was based on what Statistics SA provided you  with.  If
that is so, hon Minister, you will need to - I  am  afraid  -  show  courage
again  to  renegotiate  the  wage  packages,  because  this  would  put  the
macroeconomic policy of inflation targeting, which the country has  adopted,
at great risk. If the public sector packages are above  inflation,  it  will
put great pressure on our inflation targeting.

Hon Minister, we await your  action  and  see  clearly  that  you  have  the
capacity to deal with this problem, and it is a problem  that  needs  to  be
dealt with. I do not wish to take more time, and  perhaps  I  can  save  the
Chair by concluding my speech at this point. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  I  have  taken  note  of  your
point, Mr Lever. Surprisingly you have given me two minutes,  though  I  was
going to give you one minute. But I would imagine that  you  would  have  to
synchronise your watch with ours.
Mong C MOTSILILI (Kapa Botjhabela): Ke  a  leboha  Modulasetulo.  Ke  lebisa

[Mr C MOTSILILI (Eastern Cape): Thank you,  Chairperson.  I  would  like  to
honour the Minister, who is present  today,  as  well  as  members  of  this
House. Because I want the lady to give a reply to what I am  going  to  say,
which is very important, I will use  her  language  as  I  don't  trust  the
interpreting services.]

According to the 2003 intergovernmental  fiscal  review,  the  Eastern  Cape
provincial government has about 123 000 public servants in its employ.  This
represents the second highest number of  public  servants  in  a  provincial
government. Out of these people 90% were part of the former  Transkei/Ciskei
and the Cape Provincial Administration. This  diverse  background  of  these
public servants poses a huge challenge for the transformation  programme  of
our country in general, and the Eastern Cape in particular. It  is  a  well-
known fact  that  these  public  servants  considerably  exceed  the  number
required by the province.

In fact, during 1994, the national  Government  should  have  inherited  all
these civil servants, so that as a province we could recruit those  we  want
from the national pool,  rather  than  the  province  inheriting  that  huge
number of people. The responsibility of  dealing  with  excess  staff  would
have been better dealt with by a  national  government,  rather  than  being
dealt with a provincial level. As a rural province  we  are  facing  serious
challenges with respect to service delivery imperatives and Batho Pele.  The
majority of public servants in our province are committed to the  agenda  of
the democratic Government.

There are, however, some elements who  do  not  have  the  interest  of  the
people at heart. These people  are  uncaring  and  driven  by  greed.  After
realising the above challenges, the Premier of  our  province  requested  an
intervention  of  the  national  Government  through  the  office   of   the
President.  We  appreciate  the  positive  response  of  the  President   by
appointing  an  interim  management  team  to  come  up  with  a  turnaround
strategy, especially in the departments that  have  been  mentioned  before:
the Departments of Health,  Social  Development,  Education,  Transport  and
Public Works. We wish  that  this  intervention  could  have  come  earlier,
because we could have progressed very far by now.

I just want to place on record for people who don't know, because there  are
perceptions about the Eastern Cape that are flying around -  to  which  some
people perhaps unconsciously contribute - that the IMT is made up of  senior
public servants who come from national departments  to  the  Public  Service
Commission and the Department of  Public  Service  and  Administration,  and
also the DG of the Province and the SG of Treasury. As far as I'm aware  the
IMT has done sterling work in terms of finishing phase one, that is that  of
diagnosing the problems that have to be faced by the provincial  government.
To a large extent the year report  confirmed  what  we  already  know  as  a
province; namely the facts that there  are  many  vacancies  in  middle  and
senior management echelons,  that  some  managers  are  lacking  supervisory
skills, that there is a huge backlog in disciplinary cases, that  there  are
poor personnel management systems, and others that have been referred to.

Hajwale IMT ena entse e sebeletsa hore e tle e tle le turnaround strategy  e

Empa ntlha eo ke ratang ho se hatella kajeno, eo ke tshepang hore  o  tla  e

Ka hoo he, re ka thaba haeba ho ka  le  phethoho  mekgweng  ya  tjhadimo  ya

Sesotho paragraphs follows.)

[At present the IMT is still trying to  introduce  the  turnaround  strategy
that will try to resolve these problems that are facing our  province.  What
I would like to emphasise today, which I hope you will understand,  is  that
we as the provincial government,  together  with  the  national  Government,
should hold hands and no one should regard himself or  herself  as  superior
to others. We would like to work together, because this belongs  to  all  of
us. The Eastern Cape province is the one that accepted  homelands  like  the
Transkei, the homelands that were mostly  known  for  corruption.  Homelands
like the Ciskei were homelands established by the Afrikaner government,  and
therefore riddled with corruption.

We would therefore be very glad if there could be changes  in  the  ways  of
dealing with different circumstances and similar matters.]

Another challenge we,  as  a  province,  have  to  face  is  the  unintended
consequences of outsourcing the payment of social grants.  These  companies,
which are making payments on  behalf  of  the  Government,  are  failing  to
perform in line with  the  service  level  agreement,  and  hence  they  are
tarnishing the image of Government as a whole. They are not only  tarnishing
the image of the Eastern Cape, but of  Government  in  general.  So,  it  is
important for us to help each other as national Government. I would like  to
call upon the Department  of  Public  Service  and  Administration  and  the
Minister, to co-ordinate  a  programme  of  ensuring  that  best  practices,
especially from provinces who have chosen the outsourcing model,  be  shared
with the Eastern Cape.

I would also like to confirm the fact that some  people  have  died  in  the
queues, waiting to receive their grants. About four people  passed  away  in
April in an area called Mount Fletcher, and  during  this  week  one  passed
away in area called Nqandule. We think that it's an area that  really  needs
attention, because we believe that our Government is  a  caring  Government.
Those mistakes that arise should enable us to move with speed.

Then with respect to human resource management,  which  is  facing  daunting
challenges in the province, there is a shortage of skilled public servants.

Ha ke tsebe hore na ebe ntho e tjena e a etsahala le  lapeng  kwana  na,  ke

[I do not know whether this even happens at home, that is the Eastern  Cape.
What I am aware of is that people are appointed to various vacancies in  the
government. They only spend a few months there and then they  are  taken  by
the national departments. Perhaps this is because we  are  able  to  appoint
people who are beautiful and well dressed, or perhaps we appoint people  who
like to move to big cities. Those are the problems that we  have.  We  would
be very glad if the Department of Public Service  and  Administration  could
assist us by providing us with  a  way  of  keeping  employees  for  a  long
period. If one looked at Gauteng and the Western Cape, one  would  see  that
people in certain senior positions are people from the rural areas.

This consequently shows  that  we  are  able  to  produce  people  who  have
leadership skills and capabilities. I would therefore  like  to  talk  about
Samdi, which is the organisation that  trains  government  employees  to  be
more productive.]

I think Samdi is  supposed  to  play  a  more  active  role,  especially  at
provincial level, in  the  light  of  the  resources  that  have  been  made
available through the Skills Development  Act  and  the  skills  development
levy. There is a  huge  challenge  that  we  have  to  face,  especially  at
provincial level, and according to my knowledge ...

... ifuthe lika Samdi alivakali phaya. Ngoko ke, siya kuthanda  into  yokuba
elo futhe livakale ngamandla. [... the role that is supposed  to  be  played
there by Samdi is not clear. We  would  like  to  see  what  role  Samdi  is
playing.]

Commenting on the Public Service Commission, I would like  to  say  that  as
the Eastern Cape we appreciate the interaction that we have with the  Public
Service Commission. When we interacted with them about two and a half  years
ago, we highlighted to  them  that  the  kind  of  reports  that  they  were
presenting to us had only a bearing on national departments.  I'm  proud  to
report today that  ever  since  that  interaction  their  reports  are  very
relevant to our province. We would like to encourage  them  to  sustain  the
momentum of the interaction.

Regarding Public Service  Regulations,  we  would  like  to  call  upon  the
department and the Minister,  in  particular,  to  constantly  review  those
regulations. It  is  very  difficult,  under  the  current  dispensation  of
regulations, to discipline or get rid of deadwood  in  the  Public  Service.
I'm  reminded  of  a  case  where  a  public  servant  engaged  in   corrupt
activities. It then so happened that the person  who  was  presided  at  the
subsequent disciplinary hearing happened to have some  collusion  with  that
person. And when the report was given, the MEC  was  too  tied  up  to  act,
because there is a regulation which specifies that she cannot intervene.  Ke
dintho tseno tse tlamehileng hore di shejwe.  [These  are  the  things  that
should be taken into account.]

But in general we think that the budget  speech  and  the  budget  programme
should be implemented, and we would like the effect ... le moya  wa  lefapha
lena o utlwahale mahae kwana. Ke a  leboha.  [  ...  and  this  department's
spirit should be felt even in the rural areas. Thank you.]

The MINISTER FOR THE PUBLIC  SERVICE  AND  ADMINISTRATION:  Thank  you  very
much, Deputy Chair, and thanks to all members for the vibrant  participation
in this particular budget debate.

I want to start my rejoinder by quoting Ben Okri, an African author:


  Hope and striving have magic in them. Those who have much to strive  for,
  much to resolve and overcome and redream, may be luckier than they think.
  Struggle is life.
I raise this in terms of this particular  portfolio  and  clearly  the  huge
challenges that we face, having identified the  magnitude  of  the  task  we
must confront as we are involved in the agenda of transforming the  colossus
of the Public Service.

Having said that, and before I take that further  in  the  spirit  of  ``the
tide has turned'', I would first like to respond to issues  raised.  I  want
to start with the most difficult one that was raised by Kgoshi  Mokoena  and
others: It is unacceptable that a department does  not  present  before  the
select committee. It is unacceptable, and I will  ensure  that  there  is  a
written reason given for why it has not happened. I have a note  here  about
what happened, but I am too embarrassed to read this note,  because  I  feel
that we are all here as elected representatives of the people, carrying  out
our duties, as clearly identified in the Constitution, and that if there  is
a problem, there should always be a fall-back to deal with it.  And  clearly
there will be a written explanation.

I do, however, also want to say in a similar vein that there is a  need  for
much greater interaction between the  committee  itself  and  my  office.  I
never got any indication, prior to being informed today, that  there  was  a
failure of an attendance by one component, and I do want to say that  it  is
something that I would have appreciated a letter directly to me on.

I think it is also necessary to state that the Department of Public  Service
and Administration is but one of those that fall under my portfolio,  and  I
would like to have an indication, not necessarily today, if  there  are  any
others who have fallen foul in a similar  manner.  But  we  will  deal  with
this, and I think we are humbled by this instance. This  is  a  huge  lesson
for us, an unfortunate lesson, but it is a lesson we will learn from.

I would like to reflect on the whole question of the scourge  of  corruption
and how we are handling that within the Public Service. I do want to  state,
and will do so through example, that  there  have  been,  very  clearly,  an
attempt to ensure that we deal with corruption. Our anticorruption drive  is
one that is very hands-on.

The  Public  Service  Commission  has  played  a  very  specific  role,  and
continues to make useful investigations into specific cases  of  corruption;
the findings of which provide insight into the problem,  and  also  provides
us with practical and realistic solutions. We can go into  this  in  a  fair
amount of detail, but I do not think time is permitting.

Where I do think that we should tie things up a  bit  better,  is  the  fact
that  we  should  ensure  that  the  Anticorruption  Forum,  that  has  been
revitalised,  plays  the  kind  of  role  that  it  should  in  the  various
stakeholder groupings that constitute the forum. And as you are  aware,  the
Anticorruption  Forum  consists  of  civil  society,  private   sector   and
Government.

We have found that, in  terms  of  meeting  the  obligations  that  we  have
identified at the Anticorruption Conference that was  hosted  by  Parliament
itself, and at subsequent meetings, that it is  the  Government  that  takes
its obligation forward.  But  our  various  partners  have  not  necessarily
played as much a role in their sectors as required. We understand  that  the
civil society sector has difficulties.  They  have  reflected  in  a  report
before the portfolio committee in the National Assembly that they have  lost
a number of people, and that there has been a complexity  about  it.  But  I
think it might be useful for the select committee  to  invite  the  National
Anticorruption Forum in order to receive a report from them.

There are various findings that  are  captured  in  the  written  vote  that
reflects on a report that had been commissioned by us,  along  with  one  of
the agencies of the United Nations, that looks at, and  has  actually  done,
an investigation into the extent of corruption in  South  Africa.  What  has
come out very clearly, is that the perception of corruption is  much  higher
than the actual experience in instances. But our argument is, and I  believe
that this is the argument of this House, that we would  want  to  build,  as
far as possible,  a  corruption-free  environment;  hence  any  instance  of
corruption is one too many.

But the report that we had commissioned, had assessed  that  the  political,
legislative and institutional frameworks are in place to combat  corruption,
and  it  also  concluded  that  we  do  have  a  solid,  progressive  ethics
infrastructure in place.

There is legislation, The Prevention of Corruption Bill, that must be  fast-
tracked. But just as a reminder, in terms of the revelation  of  corruption,
it was pointed out in the process that  in  official  processes,  Government
itself has exposed and discovered 60% of  the  cases  of  corruption.  Civil
society has only uncovered 18%. Whistle-blowers have only  been  responsible
for 13%. We were concerned about it. We thought that we probably  needed  to
ensure that there was greater  encouragement  for  whistle-blowers  to  come
out. However, the most depressing part  was  that  investigative  journalism
only constituted 8,4%. We felt that the press always pride  themselves  that
they have an important role to play, but we think they can  do  much  better
than that.

In terms of the point that was raised  by  the  hon  Yusuf  Gabru  from  the
Western Cape: As we confront the issue of the restructuring  of  the  Public
Service and look at the question of Resolution 7, we have,  as  the  process
has developed, of course realised  the  fact  that  there  is  a  particular
reality facing us where there are lower level public servants, and not  only
in the education sector, which may be located in a particular area  where  a
particular department may have identified them as in excess  of  the  Public
Service. We have an instance where, in the Eastern  Cape,  in  a  particular
department a  few  hundred  people  that  are  in  one  location  have  been
identified as being in excess.

We have, of course, said that we do have to look  at  how  we  manage  cases
such as these, but we also need to confront the  reality  that  there  is  a
need for departments to identify what their human resource  needs  are,  and
they also need to identify if there are  certain  functions  that  they  may
consider noncore functions of the department.

Having said that, we have not taken a `devil may care'  attitude  and  said:
Just go ahead and retrench. Hence you would see, if you look  at  Resolution
7, the issue of retrenchment  is  at  the  end  of  the  very  process.  All
departments must engage  proactively  in  looking  at  whether  there  is  a
possibility of finding alternative employment,  or  to  review  the  way  in
which they may have looked at the staff establishment.

But, separate from that, we are not going  to  keep  people  in  the  Public
Service who should not be there. We cannot keep people to  dig  a  hole  and
fill it up, because there happen to be  some  people  as  example  reflected
here today, who actually do no work in the Public Service.  They  receive  a
salary, but they do not work.

I am not suggesting that the education sector workers  you  referred  to  is
that category of worker, because I know that whether  in  senior  or  middle
management, or lower down in the Public Service, there have been  those  who
are not interested in being part of the turning of  the  tide  and  them  we
want out. And we feel that it is the responsibility of managers to  identify
those employees.

I would agree with those members who have said that there  is  a  reluctance
from certain senior managers to fully  apply  Resolution  7.  We  have  seen
this. As a matter of fact, the application of  the  resolution  only  really
got effected as from about October last year. Before that there  was  either
a view that a year is a long time, or a view of  noncommitment  from  senior
public servants. I am glad to say this has changed.  But  as  a  result  the
kind of problems that are coming to the fore are only  coming  to  the  fore
now, and they should have been identified much earlier.

The process itself was due to be completed by the end of June - that is  the
full process - including the matching and placement, the  identification  of
excess personnel, identifying those who will be counselled and retrained  in
order to prepare them to leave the Public Service, etc.

We  have  determined,  through  the  reports  we  received,   that   certain
departments are not quite ready for  the  completion  of  the  process,  and
hence we  have  extended  the  moratorium  of  vacant  posts.  And  this  is
particularly to allow us to identify people from other departments  who  can
be redeployed. But the complexities, I think there is no question,  we  will
confront.

Let me, before my time runs out, deal with some of the issues that  came  up
as curve balls.  There  are  two.  There  is  one  that  was  raised  by  Mr
Aulsebrooke from KwaZulu-Natal, and I must say I was a bit confused. On  the
one hand you say we are overregulating; on  the  other  hand  you  then  say
please regulate and ensure that there is legislation in place in order  that
we do not have the kind of job-hopping that is there.

I think we need to decide: Should we regulate further or not?  I  also  want
to respectfully point to the issues that you raised as problem  issues,  and
then said that they were  due  to  overregulation.  You  said  we  have  the
problem that we change regulations and the system too  frequently.  We  have
the Public Service Act, the BCEA, the EEA, Public Service regulations, etc.

The Public Service Act has only been amended once.  It  was  promulgated  in
1994 and amended in 1999. I would not call that swift changing. As a  matter
of fact, I actually wanted to thank Parliament for not being too focused  on
the changing of laws and saying that  I  should  ensure  that  I  bring  new
legislation for the sake of legislation being passed,  but  rather  allowing
us to be able to over the 10 year period reflect on  where  we  think  there
are limitations in the regulatory framework.

I will give one example: There is a view that there are certain  aspects  of
the Public Finance Management Act and the Public Service Act that  may  need
a closer look, especially  the  issue  of  the  human  resources  component.
However, I want to  state  today  we  have  clearly  decided  that  at  this
particular point  in  time,  not  unlike  the  prevailing  view,  just  more
broadly, we will not move the human resources function to managers, as  some
may argue the PFMA requires, because there is not the required, let us  call
it infrastructure due to lack of a better word, or institutions  to  support
that, which may be in the instance of the budget.

To control the budget you have the Auditor-General, you have  the  portfolio
committee that looks at the issue of public accounts, etc. There  are  clear
disincentives  if  there  is  a  violation  of  the  budget,   for   example
overspending. There is also a need to report on underspending.

For the human resource component there is not a mechanism that  monitors  it
in a similar way. The Auditor-General is trying to look  at  some  level  of
performance accounting, but  we  do  not  really  believe  that  it  is  the
function of an Auditor-General to look  at  the  area  of  human  resources,
because it is a specialised area. It  is  an  area  that  should  rather  be
looked at by human resource practitioners, and  it  is  a  function  that  I
would argue needs to be dealt with in line with what comes up  in  the  area
of public administration and the human resource focus.

Am I running out of time completely? Can I finish up? Can I just wrap up  on
that?

I then want to conclude with the point that was raised by hon  Lever,  which
almost seems to suggest that in Government the  right  hand  does  not  know
what the left hand does. I think it  is  totally  irresponsible.  You  would
note that a wage agreement was reached and the signing took place  yesterday
morning. I announced before national Parliament yesterday  that  the  salary
increment for public servants this year is 8,5% across the  board,  with  1%
that is based on a pay-progression system. It is performance-based.

We looked very clearly at CPIX and, as a matter of fact,  we  did  not  have
discussions with organised labour, or as the Ministers'  committee,  on  the
budget, before the CPIX figures were  made  known,  especially  taking  into
account the correction that was effected. And if you had  bothered  to  look
at the three-year wage agreement, it said that if CPIX is less  than  4%  or
more than 7,5%, we should re-open for negotiation.

If you look at the correction of CPIX for the past year, CPIX for  the  year
more or less stands at 9%. Together  with  organised  labour,  reflecting  a
maturation of our relations in collective bargaining, we  decided  we  would
not reopen negotiation, but rather effect a settlement that would take  that
into account.

And we are absolutely au fait with what  the  macroeconomic  projections  of
CPIX  is  for  the  forthcoming  year.  Because,  after  all,  salaries  are
projected for the financial year ahead. So, I think  to  ever  suggest  that
that is not considered, is totally irresponsible. I also want to state,  for
your knowledge, that I chair  the  Minister's  mandate  committee,  and  the
Ministers of Finance, Education, Safety and Security,  Health,  Justice  and
Constitutional Development,  as  well  as  Defence,  serve  on  the  mandate
committee. So, I did not quite appreciate that point, but  I  am  sure  that
you will withdraw it on having this information.

I would like to thank everyone for their participation in this  debate,  and
I want to conclude with a further quote, and in  this  instance  I  quote  a
former American President, Theodore Roosevelt:


  The credit belongs to the man [or woman, I add] who is  actually  in  the
  arena, whose face is marred by dust and  sweat  and  blood,  who  strives
  valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again, who knows the  great
  enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends himself  (or  herself)  in  a
  worthy cause, who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement,  who
  at the worst, if he (or she) fails, at least fails while daring  greatly,
  so that his (or her) place will never be with those cold and timid  souls
  who neither know victory nor defeat.

Thank you very much for your comments  and  your  acceptance  of  the  vote.
[Applause.]
Debate concluded.

    THE YOUTH AS A CATALYST FOR TRANSFORMATION, DEMOCRACY AND DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr T S SETONA:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  comrades  and  friends,  it  is
fitting on the occasion of a debate  of  this  nature  that  one  begins  by
quoting from the fountain of wisdom. In doing that, I will  quote  the  late
President of the ANC, Comrade Oliver Reginald Tambo, as I did in  the  past.
He said, and I quote: ``A nation that does not value its youth  deserves  no
future''.

As we debate this critical topic today, it affords  us  the  opportunity  to
assess the extent to which we as Government,  and  as  society  in  general,
have succeeded in bettering the lives of our people. It  is  important  that
we begin by understanding that the responsibility of bettering the lives  of
young people does not only lie with Government, but with  civil  society  as
well. In making this statement, I want to remind every speaker who is  going
to speak that from time to time, when we  make  our  points,  we  must  also
reflect the extent to  which  our  own  organisations  and  communities  are
contributing in terms of  profiling  the  lives  of  young  people  in  this
country.

This august House once again focuses its attention on this  critical  sector
of our society, the youth of our country, which has occupied,  and  continue
to occupy, a special place in a tapestry of the rich history of struggle  to
reclaim our motherland  from  white  minority  domination.  Assembled  here,
after nine years of democratic governance, and three days  before  the  27th
anniversary of the 16 June 1976 youth uprising, there is indeed great  cause
for us to pause and reflect on the extent  our  Government  and  society  in
general has accorded the youth of our country  its  rightful  place  in  the
ongoing struggle for democracy, growth and development.

History  dictates  that  we  proceed  from  the  premise  that  before   the
breakthrough of 27 April 1994, the overwhelming majority of our youth -  the
black youth in particular -  has  known  no  life,  other  than  a  life  of
hardships, strife, misery, persecution and even death at the  callous  hands
of  blood-thirsty  security  forces.  Racial  inequities,  poverty,  endemic
diseases, unemployment, and skills shortages that  continue  to  define  the
lives of the majority of our youth are testimonies  and  legacies  of  young
life under apartheid colonialism.

No doubt that the history of South Africa is written with blood,  sweat  and
tears of successive  generations  of  young  people  in  this  country.  The
culture of  unassailable  resilience  of  our  youth  for  many  decades  of
apartheid repressive rule, is owed to no one but  the  founding  fathers  of
the premier youth movement of our country, the ANC Youth League,  which  was
founded in 1944. We owe it to the courageous and selfless leadership of  the
likes of Anton Lembede, Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu,  Nelson  Mandela,  Duma
Nokwe and others that, as the generation of  the  African  century,  we  are
bold to declare this afternoon, and I quote: ``We  look  at  our  past  with
pride and anticipate our future with hope and courage''.
To them, our forebears, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to  the  cause
of an Africa where peace, democracy and prosperity will be the order of  the
day. We reaffirm and  reclaim  their  founding  motto  that,  and  I  quote:
``Africa's cause must triumph''. Like those on whose immediate footsteps  we
are trotting today, the likes of Solomon Mahlangu, Barney  Molokwane,  Parks
Mankahlana, Peter Mokaba, Ephraim Nkoe and others, our  generation  is  more
than determined to ensure that your death was not in vain.

On behalf of the ANC, I rise to join the nation and  freedom  loving  people
of the world to dip banners in fitting memory and  salute  all  martyrs  and
patriots who perished in the line of duty to free our country from  poverty,
hunger, racial degradation and underdevelopment.  In  doing  this,  we  will
prove our detractors wrong.  Our  generation,  despite  difficulties  ahead,
will not rest until South Africa is liberated. In our view,  the  liberation
of this country transcends the limits of political democracy. We  will  have
achieved our liberation when the ideals of the  Freedom  Charter  becomes  a
living reality that defines the lives of our people - and  young  people  in
particular.

We are making this statement  because  the  youth  of  this  country,  young
women, the rural and urban youth,  constitute  the  majority  of  those  who
continue to bear the brunt of the the legacy of  apartheid.  We  are  proud,
because our generation, following on the footsteps of the generation of  the
1940s, demand opportunities. They don't expect freedom to come on  a  silver
plate. They appreciate and understand the  huge  backlog  confronting  their
Government in undoing the legacy of apartheid.

In their own declaration to the country and to our Government in  particular
on the occasion of their march to Parliament this morning, the young  people
of country said, and I quote:


  The youth sector fully appreciate what our Government  has  delivered  to
  the people of South  Africa,  particularly  the  youth.  As  the  country
  prepares to celebrate the first decade of freedom, the youth sector  also
  has a good reason to be jubilant.

That was the declaration by the multiplicity  of  organisations  represented
in the South African  Youth  Council  this  morning  when  they  marched  to
Parliament. This is in full appreciation of the challenges  the  country  is
confronting in reversing the  legacy  of  the  past,  whilst  simultaneously
committing young people to be at the service of the nation.  This  march  to
Parliament organised  by  the  National  Youth  Commission,  which  saw  the
participation of more than 15 000 youth, across  all  racial  and  political
spectra, is a testimony of the opportunities our Government has created  for
our youth to participate in the national life of our country.

Contrary to the narrow sectarian view  of  some  amongst  us,  who  find  it
fashionable to hasten to call for the  dissolution  of  the  National  Youth
Commission, participation of overwhelming numbers of our youth in the  Youth
Commission organised march, has represented  the  resentment  of  our  youth
against the ``fight back'' strategy. Our youth wants participation  and  co-
operation in resolving the problems of this country and  their  plight,  not
some echoes of ``fight  back'',  which  is  reminiscent  of  cowboy  tactics
representing the interests of a small  fraction  of  our  society.  We  must
assure those who are dreaming about the dissolution of  the  National  Youth
Commission that their dreams will never come  true,  particularly  when  the
51st assembly of our people, the Stellenbosch  conference  of  the  ANC  has
reaffirmed, in no uncertain terms,  the  relevance  of  the  National  Youth
Commission.

The National Youth Commission has fulfilled and continue to fulfil its  core
mandate which, amongst others, include the following: The development  of  a
comprehensive national youth policy for our  country,  and  of  course  they
have developed  that  policy  and  it  has  been  adopted  by  Cabinet;  co-
ordinating the work of various Government departments  to  ensure  bias  and
cohesion  in  terms  of  youth  development;   the   establishment   of   an
interdevelopmental committee on youth by Government which  annually  reviews
its impact on the youth is  the  fulfilment  of  the  core  mandate  of  the
National Youth Commission. There are also  ongoing  flagship  programmes  by
the National Youth Commission in collaboration with Government  departments.
These are programmes like the farming projects in the North  West  province,
Free State, Western Cape and the Northern Cape, which are among the  central
projects that the Youth  Commission  has  facilitated  to  fast-track  youth
development in our country.

It may be because these  projects  do  not  benefit  the  powerful  and  the
privileged  that  they  do  not  get  any  recognition  from  some  of   our
detractors. The key critical test to measure the success or failure  of  the
National Youth Commission must be located in the understanding of  the  fact
that it is not an implementing agency of  Government.  For  those  who  seek
clarity on the core mandate of the commission, the  following  are  the  key
words that define its functions and roles: Lobbying,  advocacy,  monitoring,
facilitating and co-ordinating.

Obviously, arising from this understanding, no sane person  can  expect  the
commission to create jobs. It cannot. No sane person can  expect  the  youth
commission to build schools, provide skills training for the  youth  and  to
distribute nevirapine for those who demand it. It is  not  their  task.  The
commission  can  only  facilitate  and  lobby   implementing   agencies   of
Government to do all these as and when it so agrees, and finds it  necessary
for such programmes to be implemented. It can only advocate, monitor and co-
ordinate.

In this regard, we are proud to declare that  the  dominance  of  the  youth
unemployment on the agenda of the Growth and  Development  Summit  over  the
last week is one major success of the National  Youth  Commission  which  we
all ought to  celebrate.  For  the  first  time  in  this  country,  labour,
Government and business agree that if the country does  not  take  conscious
decisions to empower the youth, it has no future at all.  I  speak  with  no
fear of contradiction that the youth of our country is  inspired  with  hope
by the work of the NYC and it will not dissolve, because  if  we  capitulate
to the demand of dissolving  the  commission,  we  will  insult  many  young
people who died for this freedom.
In conclusion, let me say that our  Government  has  created  platforms  and
opportunities for young people to determine their own  future.  These  young
people are occupying the centre stage to grab those opportunities for  their
development. I must conclude by quoting the late  Secretary-General  of  the
SACP, the giant of our continent, the late Comrade  Moses  Kotane,  when  he
said:


  At this hour of destiny, the country and its people need you, the  future
  is in you hands, and it will be what you make of it.

I conclude by challenging Mr Raju, in particular, to come and  tell  us  the
vision of the DP, in terms of empowering the youth of this  country,  for  a
better future. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mr Raju  has  promised  that  he  will
pick up the gauntlet.

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson,  hon  members,  young  people  possess  the  drive,
ability and potential to help  both  themselves  and  their  communities.  I
believe that young people have ideas that need to be  heard,  thoughts  that
are  worth  heeding  and  capabilities  that  are  worth  harnessing.  Youth
mainstreaming must involve young  people  in  all  aspects  of  life.  Youth
participation and leadership must facilitate the role  of  young  people  in
the political process, not just as  voters,  but  as  members  of  political
organisations, heads of lobbying groups and candidates for elections.

Young people represent a large and motivated  workforce.  We  must  work  to
help young people achieve their own career aspirations. Youth  are  critical
in the wellbeing of any nation. Not only can they contribute to society  and
the economy in the present, but they also represent the future  backbone  of
a country. Any realistic attempt to meet human resource development  targets
must include  opportunities  for  youth  to  invest  in  themselves  through
education and work programmes.

Particularly in the developing world, health  issues  are  becoming  a  more
prominent concern. Youth empowerment is becoming an  increasingly  important
part of any strategy to address health issues. A  combination  of  education
and social change  is  necessary  for  youth  to  take  an  active  role  in
protecting their own health and wellbeing from the risk of  infection.  They
also need knowledge in order to help their families and communities  support
those living with HIV/Aids.

Youth are central to meeting the challenges of globalisation.  Their  energy
and industry will be the engine of wealth creation and poverty  elimination.
Their empowerment is the key. There is no meeting the challenge without  the
full participation of the  youth.  Traditional  formal  education  can  give
young people a great start in life, but does not  always  ensure  that  they
will always be able to get a job. The  conventional  route  from  school  to
tertiary  education  does  not  exist  for  many  young  people.  Unemployed
graduates with technical knowledge who lack skills or experience  that  make
them employable or enable them to start up  their  own  employment  ventures
are a feature that we should take cognisance of.  There  is  evidence  that,
with the right  training  and  outreach  support  services,  young  people's
business ventures can achieve a good level of success.

The goal for young people  must  go  beyond  survival,  to  development  and
involvement. It is in their interest and ours to ensure that  they  have  an
adequate standard of living and protection from economic, sexual,  emotional
and physical harm or exploitation. But,  global  productivity  and  security
will hinge on developing their full potential and engaging  them,  not  only
as beneficiaries but as participants and problem solvers.

In conclusion, I urge all young people to look outside themselves. I say  to
them, ``Don't act like victims just because you feel  politically  powerless
because you are young. You have choices in how you lead your lives, in  what
you get out of life and what you give back. It is your world,  and  it  will
be a better world with your involvement in it.'' I thank you. [Applause.]

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo ohloniphekileyo neNdlu  yonke,  kunesisho  esithi:

ekuhlomiseni intsha yethu ekubeni abaholi  abaqotho,  abanolwazi  nabazokuba

... (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson and  the  House  at  large,  there  is  a
teaching that goes: You must raise your child in the proper way so  that  he
does not deviate from it when he is grown up. There is also  a  saying  that
goes: The water-pot resembles the cooking-pot, or:  The  small  tuber  comes
from the big one. In English  we  say:  Like  mother,  like  daughter;  like
father, like son.

It is true that our youth is our future. Our youth are the wings with  which
we fly, but this depends on what you taught, how you brought up and how  you
advised them. If you sow love, you  will  reap  even  more  love  from  your
children, because heredity intensifies traits. If you sow hatred,  you  will
reap even more hatred from your children. The youth is groomed at home -  in
the family, it is groomed in the community - at school.

If it has been well groomed, it enlightens the whole community  and  becomes
useful to it and the whole nation. The youth is needed  in  the  development
of the country, in its economy, which could be finance,  trade,  technology,
and in many spheres in which the economy could grow  and  development  as  a
whole could take place.

The number of youth who spread violence and crime,  who  do  not  listen  to
good advice, who are disrespectful, who have no regard  for  other  people's
property and engage in other forms of misconduct  must  decrease.  All  this
goes back to what I mentioned earlier on, the issue of how we bring  up  and
teach our children, who are  our  future.  Education  is  a  very  important
weapon in arming our youth to become dignified,  knowledgeable  leaders  who
will become a source of change at this time.

Our children must get their education without the problems  that  they  come
across. It is good that  the  Minister  of  Education  considers  abolishing
school fees. Those fees make learning difficult for our  children.  A  child
who has not paid because his  or  her  parent  has  no  money,  is  severely
punished.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mrs Vilakazi, that  member  is  up  on
point of order, I presume. So, please take your seat.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: So, I still have time. I thought I was being cut off.

Ms G N SWARTBOOI: Chairperson, on a point of order: I  just  wonder  if  the
hon member is prepared to take a question. I wanted to ask whether she is  a
member of any youth movement. [Laughter.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I am not entertaining questions now.  I  am  delivering  a
speech. I don't want to be disturbed, please. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Continue, Mrs Vilakazi.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI:  Chairperson,  a  transition  to  a  globally  competitive
economy while simultaneously attempting to consolidate democracy at home  is
about respect, having your voice heard, jobs, shelter, food  and  power.  No
democracy can exist on ignorance.  To  pull  people  out  of  the  abyss  of
poverty, education and skills training have to be  the  helping  hand.  What
type of skills are we offering our youth?  Are  they  productive?  Are  they
accessible? Are they affordable? Are they relevant?

Youth have to engage in survivalist  strategies,  and  often  have  to  face
feelings of insecurity.

Lapho ngiqale khona ngithe: Khulisa umntwana ngendlela ofuna abe  yiyo.  Uma
esekhulile ngeke asuke kuyona. [Ihlombe.] [When I started my speech I  said:
Raise your child the way you want him or her to be. When  he  or  she  grows
up, he or she will not deviate from it. [Applause.]]

Nksz N C KONDLO: Sihlalo, xa ndiza kuhlomla kule ngxoxo isihloko  sibaluleke
kangaka ngolutsha, ndifuna nje ukuthi  eneneni  le  ngxoxo  iqhuba  ngexesha
elifanelekileyo kuba yonke le  nyanga  ulutsha  lwaseMzantsi  Afrika  lwenza
imigushuzo  ebonakalisa  ukuphila  nokubakho   kwalo.   Kambe   thina   bemi
baseMzantsi  Afrika  sinebhongo  negugu  ngolutsha  lwethu  ngenxa  yegalelo

[Ms N C KONDLO: Chairperson, as I  am  about  to  deliberate  on  this  very
important discussion about youth, I would like to  say  that  in  fact  this
discussion is taking place at a very crucial and  appropriate  time  because
during this month, youth of South Africa  are  engaged  in  programmes  that
serve to indicate that they are alive and want to be active participants  in
the development of their country. As citizens of South Africa, we are  proud
of our youth because of their considerable contribution  towards  change  in
this country. A majority of them gave up their lives in order  those  of  us
who were discriminated]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Sorry,  hon  member.  Just  a
short announcement. There seems to be a problem with  the  interpreting.  If
hon members can bear with us on that point.

Ms N C KONDLO: Don't forget my three minutes, Chair, for the interruption.

Kambe sithi uninzi lolu lutsha lunikezele ngobomi balo khon' ukuze mna  nawe
samkele,  singabacinezelwa,  sixhamle  inkululeko  ndaweninye  nabacinezeli.
Sohlala siwakhumbula amaqhawe olutsha: ooHector Peterson; ooNolizwe  Mnyaka;
Anton Fransch; Ashley Kriel; iSixhenxe saseGuguleth. Sihlalo,  uluhlu  lude.
Sithembisa ukuba kwabo amagama abo angazange abekho  ezincwadini,  mhlawumbi
ekwathi ngendlela abathabatha ngayo inxaxheba asakwazi  ukuthabatha  amagama
abo igalelo labo, igalelo labo asisayi kulilibala.

Okwesibini, ndifuna ukuthi ukuze  idabi  lokuguqula  ubomi  nokwakha  ikamva
elililo lesizwe sethu ukuze ilizwe  lethu  libe  likhulu  lilunge,  kufanele
siqaphele, senze izinto ezijongene  nokuphuhlisa  ulutsha.  Amanani  olutsha
eMzantsi Afrika athi kuluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika  luphela  ama-40  eepesenti
lulutsha.  Ngokunjalo,  kumashumi  amane  anesithandathu  ekhulwini   abantu
baseMzantsi Afrika abangekho msebenzini lulutsha.

Amanani olutsha  oluphangelayo  angaphantsi  kwamashumi  amabini  ekhulwini.
Inani  lolutsha  olungamaxhoba  kaGawulayo  liphezulu  kakhulu.  La   manani
asibonisa mhlophe uxanduva esijongene  nalo  njengesizwe.  Kunjalo  kufanele
ukuba  sitsho  namhlanje  ukuba  mininzi  imisebenzi  kwanegalelo   elenziwe
nguRhulumente ukulungisa ezi meko.

Okokuqala,  selibukhankanyile  ilungu   elihloniphekileyo   uSetona   ubukho
beKomishoni  yoLutsha.  Uxanduva   lwethu   kukuqinisekisa   ukuba   ulutsha
lwaseMzantsi Afrika, njengabantu abanyulelwe  ukuba  bamele  abantu,  bayazi
ukuba yintoni umsebenzi  wekomishoni,  kwanokuba  ziintoni  ekufuneka  ukuba
thina njengabameli boluntu sizise kulutsha lwethu khon' ukuze  luze  kukwazi
ukuxhamla kwezi nkqubo. Okwesibini,  mininzi  imithetho  neenkqubo  kumasebe
onke kaRhulumente ezijongene nokuphucula iinkqubo zolutsha. (Translation  of
isiXhosa speech follows.)

[The  youth  of  this  country  gave  up  their  lives  struggling  for  the
liberation of you and me and so that  people  who  had  been  oppressed,  we
should enjoy freedom together with those who oppressed us.  We  will  always
remember the  young  lions  like  Hector  Peterson,  Nolizwe  Mnyaka,  Anton
Fransch, Ashley Kriel and the Gugulethu  Seven.  Chairperson,  the  list  is
very  long.  We  promise  never  to  forget  the  others   who   contributed
considerably to the struggle and whose names  are  missing  in  our  records
because of various reasons.

Secondly, I would like to say that in order for our efforts  to  change  the
lives of people and build a  future  for  our  country  to  materialise,  we
should stride carefully as we seek to develop  the  youth.  Statistics  show
that 40% of South Africa's population is made up of young people. They  also
indicate that 46% of young people are unemployed  and  less  than  20%  form
part of the workforce. The number of young people infected with HIV/Aids  is
very high. These statistics  indicate  the  responsibility  our  country  is
facing. Today, however, we are proud of the contribution our  Government  is
making to address these conditions.

Hon Setona talked about the Youth  Commission.  As  representatives  of  the
people, our responsibility is to ensure that  the  youth  of  South  Africa,
know what this commission is all about as well as what things we need to  do
to make it possible for our youth to benefit from these programmes.  In  all
Government departments there is legislation  that  is  meant  to  guide  and
support these youth programmes.]

Whether you speak of the transformation of the child and youth  care  system
in the Department of Social Development, that is meant  to  redirect  youths
that are involved in criminal activities to be diverted  away  from  getting
deep into the criminal justice system;  whether  you  speak  of  the  skills
training programmes that are contained in the Department of Labour;  whether
you speak of the labour-intensive programmes, as contained  in  your  Public
Works Programmes; whether it is the multipurpose centres built by the  Youth
Commission, all these programmes that can be found  in  various  departments
are targeting young people.

Kwakhona,  kumaphondo  ngamaphondo,  kumasebe  ngamasebe  sinento  esiyibiza
ngokuba licandelo leenkqubo ezikhethekileyo. [Furthermore, in the  different
provinces and in the different departments we have what we refer to  as  the
special programmes unit.]
We have what we refer to as the special programmes  unit.  These  units,  in
all these different departments in  the  various  provinces,  are  meant  to
target young people, women and people with disabilities.

Uxanduva lwethu singamalungu ePalamente kukuqinisekisa kwiindawo  esisebenza
kuzo ukuba ulutsha luyazazi ezi nkqubo. Zonke ezi nkqubo  ziya  kuthi  ukuze
zisebenze ziye kulutsha ngqo ibe  lulutsha  ngokwalo  oluthabatha  inxaxheba
ekuguquleni  ubomi  balo.  Iyaqwalaseleka  yokuba  ulutsha   oluninzi   into
namhlanje  luthande   ukungabi   namdla   kakhulu   kwizinto   eziphathelene
nezopolitiko. Loo nto yenza ukuba ulutsha  lwanamhlanje  lunganiki  ngqalelo
kakhulu ekuqinisekiseni ukuba iingququ ezijongene nalo luthabatha  inxaxheba
kuzo.

Kambe ke, ndifuna ukucela umngeni kuthi ngokubanzi malunga  nokuba  ziintoni
ke  ngoko  emasizenze  ukuqinisa  ezi  nkqubo.   Okokuqala,   masiqinisekise
unxibelelwano  nentsebenziswano  phakathi  kwamasebe  namanqanaba  omathathu
kaRhulumente, kubandakanywa imibutho jikelele ejongene neenkqubo zolutsha.
Okwesibini, masijolise ngendlela eqhubayo kwiimfundiso ezakhayo,  ubuncinane
kulutsha.   Kwakhona,   ulutsha   malunikezwe   umkhomba-ndlela   ngezifundo
olunokuthi luzenze ezikolweni khon' ukuze xa  lupasile  lukwazi  ukuba  luze
kusebenzisa amava alo. Sinethemba lokuba ulutsha luya  kuthabatha  inxaxheba
kuzo  zonke  izinto  eziphathelene   nalo.   Ulutsha   malube   khona   apho
kuthatyathwa izigqibo  ngabantu  abatsha  ukuze  ilizwi  lolutsha  livakale.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[In addition to that,  our  responsibility  as  members  of  Parliament,  is
ensure that youth in our constituencies  know  about  these  programmes.  In
order for these programmes to be  effective,  they  need  to  involve  youth
directly so that they themselves take part fully in  changing  their  lives.
It is becoming clear that nowadays youth are not showing  much  interest  in
politics. That results in  the  youth  not  making  as  much  an  effort  in
ensuring that they actually participate  in  matters  that  seek  to  change
their conditions. I would, therefore, like to suggest  a  number  of  things
that we could do to strengthen these programmes.

Firstly, let us ensure that there is communication and co-operation  between
departments and the three spheres of  Government,  incorporating  all  youth
organisations. Secondly, let us teach them about morals. Youth  need  career
guidance so that they could choose subjects that they will use their  future
when pursuing certain careers and in later return to  their  communities  to
share their experiences. We  hope  that  the  youth  will  not  hesitate  to
participate in all programmes that are established for them.  They  need  to
be part of the decision-making bodies about matters that relate to them.]

We note with interest, in the GDS agreement adopted  on  7  June,  three  or
four days ago, that there are programmes that are targeting young people  in
particular. I wish to refer here to 4.5 of the GDS  agreement,  where  young
people who are at school are clearly targeted in terms  of  programmes  that
will ensure that those learners are able to be trained whilst at school.

Sithi ke, ezaa njongo zibhalwe kwisivumelwano  i-GDS,  ulutsha  maluthabathe
inxaxheba  luqinisekise  ukuba  eziya  zinto  azithethwa  nje  phaya,   koko
ziyenzeka. Loo nto ithetha ukuthi  imibutho  yolutsha  kufuneka  iqinisekise
ukuba eza zigqibo zithatyathwe kwi-GDS ziyamiliselwa.

Omnye   umceli-mngeni,   okhoyo   nakwesa   sivumelwano   i-GDS,    yindlela
nemiqathango yokufunyanwa kwemali-mboleko ngabantu  abalulutsha  xa  befunda
ezikolweni.  Ungaze  wothuke  indlela  ekukho  imiqobo  ngayo   ekuncediseni
ngakumbi  abantwana  abahluphekileyo  ukuba  bafumane  ezi  mali.  Ezi  mali
ziphela zingayi kwaba bafundi bekufanele ukuba babe bayazifumana.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi, ndifuna kwakhona  ukuhlaba  ikhwelo  kule  mibutho
ityala izimali kwiiprojekthi ulutsha ekufanele ukuba lube  luyaxhamla  kuzo,
malunga nokuba imiqathango  ebekwe  phaya  ejongene  neenkqubo  zaMashishini
asaKhasayo ayikholeleki.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)
[We, therefore say that the youth should ensure that the  objectives  stated
in  the  GDS  agreement  are  implemented.  That  also  means   that   youth
organisations be visible and be effective. Another important aspect  in  the
GDS agreement is about bursaries. One  would  be  surprised  to  know  about
conditions that are set in such a manner so  as  to  exclude  young  people,
especially those from poor backgrounds. These funds end up not going to  the
students for whom they were initially meant.

In conclusion,  I  would  like,  again,  to  call  upon  all  companies  and
organisations that fund projects from which youth should  be  benefiting  to
review their conditions and regulations because SMMEs are  finding  it  very
difficult to access the funds.]

Those conditions and regulations should be eased  a  bit,  such  that  young
people can be able to access some of these resources.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi, ndifuna ukuthi, ... [As I am about to sit down,  I
would like to say ...]

... the ANC Youth League, as the leading political  organisation  for  young
people in this country, must continue to lead  by  mobilising  young  people
around or behind the transformation  agenda.  Also,  the  ANC  Youth  League
should  continue  organising  young  people  behind  the  ANC  to  ensure  a
sustained ANC-led regime in this country. If the youth league  does  not  do
this, our democracy is  in  danger  of  being  hijacked  by  the  neoliberal
agenda, and that would lead to  the  reversal  of  all  the  gains  achieved
through the sweat and blood of the young people  of  our  country.  I  thank
you, Chair. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon special delegates,  hon  colleagues,  I  am  not
going to respond to the cheap and unfounded  allegations  against  my  party
sucked out of thin air. I consider the subject for  discussion  a  dignified
subject,  and  I  will  not  stoop  so  low  as  to  belittle   our   youth.
[Interjections.]

Never before in the history of a  nation  has  its  youth  experienced  such
trauma and suffered such trials and tribulations as during the latter  years
of the apartheid  regime.  The  1976  Soweto  schools  uprising,  driven  by
impatient and restless students, rose in a damaging swell. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Raju, please take your  seat.  Hon
member, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, on a point of order: I  just  want  to  know
from the hon member whether the DP is taking a stance  of  stooping  so  low
that they do not have a youth policy? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That is not a point  of  order.  Carry
on, Mr Raju.

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I shall certainly engage that speaker  on  that  subject
on a different occasion at a different platform.

I said the 1976 Soweto schools-uprising was like  a  mountainous,  turbulent
wave which swept aside the suffocating boat of bureaucracy  that  sought  to
keep the country's downtrodden in  a  perpetual  state  of  servitude.  That
epochal uprising of the young stalwarts of our country symbolises  the  grit
and determination and  indomitable  spirit  to  rise  above  oppression  and
assert their dignity and freedom. Many, like Hector Petersen, died in  doing
so. Others, a whole generation of them, forfeited their education, and  left
behind the meagre remnants  of  comfort  of  home  and  heart  to  join  the
liberation  forces  across  the  borders  of  the   country.   What   heroic
sacrifices! What monumental acts of valour in  the  course  of  freedom  and
democracy!

Today, the modern youth stands on the threshold of a free  democracy.  Their
responsibilities  are  of  a  different   nature   than   those   of   their
predecessors. The youth, unlike their parents,  do  not  have  to  ward  off
``the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune''. They stand at the doors  of
opportunities, but they do have responsibilities to grasp the  opportunities
in their myriad forms and become useful and decent citizens, to advance  the
cause of a better South Africa for all South Africans.

The Constitution of South Africa has committed the country towards a  common
nonracial  and  nonsexist  society,  which  not  only  the   ANC   espouses,
incidentally, for those who wish to listen. We see the youth as  a  catalyst
for transformation  and  democratic  changes,  precisely  because  of  their
exuberance in seeking the abandoned joys of life.

As a sobering thought, when we look elsewhere in Africa,  it  is  depressing
to note the terrible situations where young boys and girls are  involved  as
soldiers, fighting internecine wars and  killing  each  other.  To  see  the
youth, the flowers of a nation, decimating each other  is  neither  pleasant
nor inspiring.

Let me hasten to acknowledge that the youth of today are not all  guilty  of
living wayward lives. But we must accept the unfortunate fact that  we  have
another war on our hands, that is, the HIV/Aids which stalks the  land,  and
the youth seems to be the main victims.

We must look at the many role models in our country, in almost every  sphere
of activity, who stand as shining examples whom the young could emulate.  On
the one hand there is Mbulelo Mabizela  who,  at  only  21,  stands  out  as
captain of Orlando Pirates, one of our top teams in the country. Is  he  not
an inspiration to our youth? On the other  hand,  we  have  the  unfortunate
case of Jabu Pule who is a good example of a youngster falling victim to  an
unsavoury lifestyle. He has succumbed to the pressures of life in  the  fast
lane.

We are aware of the many  side  attractions,  distractions  and  temptations
that lurk on the highways and byways of the lives of our youth.  Of  course,
the guiltiest and most despicable one is the ubiquitous television with  its
American rottenness, sexual licence, guns and shootings. They all reside  in
our lounges. I implore our youth to cultivate discerning tastes in  watching
such programmes, in reading literature and in watching  videos,  and  to  be
careful in choosing their company, because there is such a creature as  peer
pressure, which can be really dangerous waters to navigate.

We call upon the Government and the corporate world. They dare  not  let  us
down. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Hon Deputy Chair, I understand ...  mojamorago  ke  kgosi.  Go
raya gore gompieno ke kgosi ka gore ke ja morago. [...  one  who  perseveres
reaps the greatest benefits. This means that  today,  by  speaking  last,  I
would speak the longest.]

From the debate today it is evident that neither the IFP nor the  DA  has  a
policy or any understanding regarding matters of youth  development.  It  is
obvious that they are alienated from the course of youth development in  our
country. I think our people must pardon them, because their only  vision  is
to oppose the ANC. Therefore, they  serve  no  purpose  in  society  but  to
oppose the ANC. The election is going to demonstrate again  that  they  will
be disintegrated into oblivion,and history will  judge  them  by  what  they
stand for today.

A month ago, we were laying to rest Tata Walter Sisulu,  a  veteran  of  our
revolutionary struggle. He was part of a collective  of  the  generation  of
the 1940s, a generation that  defined  its  mission  as:  ``Freedom  in  our
lifetime''.  A  Nigerian  revolutionary,  Frantz  Fanon   once   said:   ``A
generation defines its mission,  fulfil  it  or  betray  it''.  Tata  Walter
Sisulu's generation, in no uncertain terms, fulfilled  their  mission.  They
waged a  relentless  struggle  against  apartheid  colonialism,  until  they
defeated it. And, yes indeed, they attained freedom in their lifetime!

Young people in our country have never, under any conditions,  betrayed  our
revolutionary course. We can rest assured that  this  generation  too  shall
not betray  our  noble  objective,  namely  the  creation  of  a  nonracial,
nonsexist, democratic and prosperous society.

This year, as we mark the 27th anniversary of 16  June,  we  are  once  more
reminded of our terrible past; a past  that  knew  no  peace;  a  past  that
disregarded women's lives; a past that had no respect  for  children,  youth
and the elderly and everybody  else;  a  past  that  survived  on  lies  and
corruption - the list is endless.

As we celebrate this 27th anniversary in the ninth year  of  our  democracy,
it is only fitting that this year the theme calls upon all young  people  to
seize the opportunities of our democracy. But above all, it also calls  upon
them to lend a hand in pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty.  Like  true
revolutionaries,  young  people  have  to  answer  to  this   clarion   call
positively. Throughout the length and breadth of our country,  young  people
are seizing the opportunities created by our Government. But they  are  also
actively involved in pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

Hon Chair, grant me this  opportunity  to  remind  those  who  have  a  very
selective memory, like the hon Raju  and  the  DA,  those  who  suffer  from
memory lapses, particularly those who are part of the  DA,  that  just  over
the past nine years,  youth  development  in  our  society  has  made  great
strides. Firstly, we have institutions at national and provincial  level  of
governance  that  are  leading  issues  of  youth   development.   Secondly,
Government has  adopted  a  youth  policy  for  2002-07.  Thirdly,  we  have
established a youth fund called the Umsobomvu Youth Fund, which already  has
committed over R500 million to various youth development initiatives in  our
country. Fourthly, young people are organised  under  the  umbrella  of  the
South African Youth Council.

These are just but a few tremendous strides we have achieved over  the  past
nine years. The DA seems not to know this. What a shame!

Hon Chair, again give me the liberty to deal with the myth that  those  with
a selective memory, those who propagate  half-truths,  always  speak  about,
and that is the matter of youth apathy. The facts are as follows:  Today  we
have more than 100 000 young people who are  volunteering  in  a  number  of
initiatives in our country. If you should visit  police  stations,  clinics,
schools and pension paypoints today, you will find  volunteers  doing  their
daily work there. The majority of those volunteers are  the  young  men  and
women in our society. Is there apathy in that regard?

I want to remind hon members of that party that last year,  when  we  hosted
the Cricket World Cup, we mobilised more than 100 000 people  as  volunteers
to welcome our visitors. Are these  young  people  patriotic,  or  are  they
apathetic? That is the question that the DA and everybody  else  must  begin
to answer.

Today young people are organised in various capacities.  They  are  engaging
in constructive activities to build a better South Africa. These  activities
may be of a cultural,  organisational,  political,  sport,  recreational  or
economic nature. It is a fact and not a myth, hon Raju,  that  young  people
are organised and are actively involved in shaping a better  and  prosperous
society. Those who are alienated from young people, those who  are  allergic
to youth activism, will spread lies and distortions about youth patriotism.

The President has said that the tide has turned. I can assure the  youth  of
our country and continent that, yes indeed, the tide has turned.

Over the past weekend South Africa has hosted a very  successful  summit  on
growth and development. Concrete and practical steps have been  outlined  by
the Growth and Development Summit. Those steps  include  the  addressing  of
youth unemployment, skills development and youth entrepreneurship.  Notably,
included amongst these, is the Youth Solidarity Fund, young  working  people
who have committed themselves to contribute one day's gross  salary  towards
youth development. Secondly, clear mechanisms have  been  put  in  place  to
roll out the national youth service programme. Thirdly, concrete plans  have
been put in place to ensure that 72 000 young people, women and people  with
disabilities have access to the learnership programmes in our economy.

This is what our Government is doing. The question is what are  the  DA  and
the IFP doing to address issues of youth development  in  our  society?  But
leave  them  to  history.  History  will  judge  them.  Thank  you,   Chair.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:20.
