     ELECTION OF ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF
                                  PROVINCES

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Let us remember those who lost their  lives  on
Remembrance Day, 11 November.

Hon members, on our own behalf, that of  the  House  and,  I  am  sure,  our
colleagues from the provinces, we welcome the President of the  Republic  of
South Africa to this  House.  We  also  welcome  the  delegations  from  the
provinces.

The Chairperson of the NCOP called for nominations.

Ms Beauty Nomvuzo Dlulane, seconded by Mr Mfuniselwa John Bhengu,  nominated
Reverend  Makhenkesi  Arnold  Stofile  for  election  as   Rotating   Deputy
Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces.

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Are  there  any  further  nominations?  Hon
members, this, after all, is an election. You are free to nominate  further.
Are there any further nominations?

HON MEMBERS: None.

The Returning Officer reported to the Chairperson that the nomination  paper
had been properly completed.

There being  no  further  nominations,  the  Chairperson  declared  Reverend
Makhenkesi Arnold Stofile duly elected Rotating Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: On behalf of  all  delegates  here  present,  I
congratulate Rev Stofile on having  been  elected  as  the  second  Rotating
Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces in terms of  section
64 (3) of the Constitution. Hon Stofile, you may now address the House.

The ROTATING DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Rev M A Stofile):  Chairperson,
hon President of the  Republic  of  South  Africa,  esteemed  delegates  and
colleagues, the NCOP was designed  to  be  a  platform  for  the  provincial
governments and their people to have a way of participating in  the  putting
up of the  structures  of  governance  and  to  entrench  democracy  in  our
provinces. It was also designed to afford us with an opportunity  to  deepen
our democracy and craft new programmes for our transformation agenda.
It is a platform where we are also afforded the opportunity to  oversee  the
extent to which quality delivery takes place in our  communities.  With  the
advent of developmental local government structures in 2000, the  NCOP  also
afforded those spheres of governance the same opportunities. It  became  the
grindstone for the sharpening of that  cutting  edge  of  service  delivery,
which is local government institutions.

It is therefore a humbling honour to be elected as part of that  team  which
must pilot and chart the way for this very august institution. I  hope  that
my participation will make a valuable contribution. I hope  not  to  be  the
weakest link in the delivery chain. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE WESTERN CAPE (Mr M C J van  Schalkwyk):  Chairperson,  as
the vacating office-bearer, I would like to offer my grateful thanks to  the
Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson and  all  officials  with  whom  I  have
worked for the last year. With our current  approach  and  emphasis  on  co-
operative  and  integrated  governance,  the  NCOP,  together   with   other
mechanisms like the  President's  Co-ordinating  Council,  the  Minmec,  the
Budget Council, the Budget Forum and the Financial  and  Fiscal  Commission,
is becoming more important by the day.

Nkulumbuso uStofile, sikujonge ngothakazelelo ukusebenzisana nawe.  Uyindoda
elumkileyo,  ebonise  ukuyiqonda  indlela  ekubaluleke  ngayo  ukuhloniphana
nokusebenzisana  kwabantu  beli  lizwe,  abantsundu,   abebala,   abamhlophe
namaNdiya. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Premier Stofile, we are eagerly looking forward to working  with  you.  You
are a wise man, and have displayed understanding of the  importance  of  the
need for the people of this country, black, coloured, white and  Indian,  to
respect one another and to work together.]

Premier Stofile, ek wil u alle voorspoed toewens. U is 'n man  met  wie  ons
kan saamwerk.  [Applous.]  [Premier  Stofile,  I  want  to  wish  you  every
success. You are a man with whom we can co-operate. [Applause.]]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Miss I W Direko): Chairperson, hon  President
and distinguished members of  this  House,  I  wish  to  join  the  previous
speaker and everybody who will speak  after  me  in  congratulating  Premier
Makhenkesi Stofile on his election  as  Second  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP. We wish  him  well  in  his  new  challenge  and  responsibility.  His
election is  yet  another  step  in  further  deepening  democracy  in  this
country.

This process adds to our people's voice and the system  of  government  that
has become a model for the rest of the  continent  and  the  people  of  the
world.

To  him  I  say  ``sterkte  vorentoe''.  [Every  strength  in  the  future.]
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Chairperson, I will  dispense  with
the niceties and give Premier Stofile some messages to carry forward  on  my
behalf and on behalf of the provinces.

He is taking over at a time when we are reviewing our  work  over  the  past
nine years going towards the next 10 years. There are  two  areas  which  we
need to work on and resolve. The  first  is:  How  do  we  ensure  that  the
programme of the national Government, the NCOP and provinces works  in  such
a way that  we  have  enough  time  for  constituency  work,  mandating  and
reporting back to the NCOP? Secondly, how do we ensure  that  when  we  pass
legislation, it has been well-thought-out and that we have looked  into  the
implications for the finances of the provinces?

The Minister of Health is  well  aware  of  what  I  am  referring  to.  Our
province supports the work she does on the Health Bill.  We  hope  that,  in
passing  this  Health  Bill  which  we  support,  we  will  ensure  that  in
redefining  local  to  environmental  health,  it   will   not   mean   that
Johannesburg, Tshwane  and  Ekurhuleni  among  others  will  have  to  close
clinics, thus depriving us of resources.

My last comment is directed at the Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, whom I don't see here. We  have  no  difficulties  in  agreeing  to
environmental issues in terms of declaring areas as  provincial  and  local.
In legislation, how  can  we  ensure  that  if  we  declare  some  areas  as
environmentally sensitive, in provinces and  local  areas,  those  resources
are available?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I notice that the hon Premier forgot  to
congratulate the successful candidate! [Laughter.]

The PREMIER OF KWAZULU-NATAL (Mr L P H M Mtshali): Chairperson, may  I  also
add our voice in congratulating our colleague, Premier  Stofile,  for  being
elevated to this position of responsibility. As colleagues, we hope that  he
will take  cognisance  of  the  fact  that  our  Constitution  provides  for
provincial competencies and that  these  will  be  guarded  quite  jealously
under his leadership in as much as he has a responsibility to  ensure  that,
as provinces, we are able to exercise our part of the shared  or  concurrent
competencies. Congratulations. [Applause.]

The  PREMIER  OF  LIMPOPO  (Adv  N  A  Ramatlhodi):  Chairperson,  and   our
President, ka se Pedi ke tlare: ke laka leo.  In  other  words,  what  I  am
trying to say is  that  I  join  those  colleagues  who  have  congratulated
Premier Stofile. I am sure that Premier Stofile is aware that he is  joining
an excellent team. Knowing him as I do, he will bring his  own  considerable
experience and strength  to  strengthen  this  team  as  we  chart  the  way
forward. He will also strengthen our democracy and ensure  that  all  levels
of governance are indeed firm. Co-operative  governance  should  become  the
hallmark of our democracy. Thank you very much, Chairperson, and good  luck,
my brother. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA (Mr N J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  his  excellency
the President, it is very easy and simple  to  say  ``Congratulations''.  In
real terms, that is usually the end of the matter. But let  me  say  that  I
know that brother Stofile will bring a lot  of  experience  into  the  whole
picture. Perhaps being a reverend,  he  will  bring  something  for  us.  Of
course, being a former Chief Whip of the ANC in the  National  Assembly,  he
will bring tons of experience to  the  team  which  will  show  us  the  way
forward. He also brings us his experience of being a Premier of one  of  the
poorest provinces in the country. That in itself tells us that we  have  the
right person at the right time.

We have so much experience in the country  of  the  democratic  rule  during
which he started as a Chief Whip. It is no  longer  the  same.  I  think  he
didn't know, in 1994, what to do on the first  day  in  the  Office  of  the
Chief Whip. Today he knows exactly what to do and how to do it. The  country
will  look  to  him  to  come  up  with  ideas.  Brother,   congratulations.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  THE  NORTHERN  CAPE  (Mr  E  M  Dipico):  Chairperson,  hon
President, the Northern Cape wishes  to  add  its  voice  in  congratulating
Premier Stofile who takes over as the Deputy  Rotating  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP.

A former Deputy Chairperson who occupied his position tells  me  that  there
is outstanding work that the NCOP has to do and perform.  Mine  is  just  to
remind him that this work needs to be completed. He  has  very  little  time
and he has to leave an indelible mark on this position  whilst  he  has  it.
There are a number of people who occupy positions and leave  without  having
made any noise. We  have  seen  it  before  in  South  Africa,  in  our  new
democratic South Africa, when one of our honoured  members  had  to  act  as
President and left a  mark,  having  acted  for  one  or  two  days.  It  is
important to do this. [Applause.]

My advice is that he should leave a mark. When he leaves,  there  should  be
evidence that he did occupy this position and future generations  will  read
all about his contributions. The Nama and Griqua people say they want to  be
united in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape.  There  is  work
to be done and once more, congratulations. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I must also inform  the  House  and  hon
members that Premier Dipico has sought my protection. He  informed  me  when
he arrived at the steps of  the  House  that  he  was  swamped  by  aspirant
candidates. He has asked me to protect him from such actions. [Laughter.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Mr P S Molefe): Chairperson of the NCOP,  hon
President of the country and hon members, the North West province joins  the
rest of the provinces in congratulating Premier Makhenkesi  Stofile  on  his
appointment as Second Deputy Rotating Chairperson of the NCOP. I agree  with
Premier Mahlangu that the incumbent will bring  in  unique  qualities  which
will consolidate the work that the NCOP has done so  far.  One  of  the  key
challenges that we have to face is to continue reflecting the diversity  and
uniqueness of the provinces, and yet, at the same time, demonstrate that  we
are one country with a common vision committed  to  a  common  programme  of
national reconstruction and development. Congratulations. [Applause.]

          ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Now  that  we  have  concluded  the  election
proceedings, I am pleased to proceed to the address of the President of  the
Republic of South Africa. President Mbeki, you may now address the  Council.
[Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Thank you very much, hon Chairperson  of  the
National Council of Provinces  Naledi  Pandor,  Deputy  Chairperson,  second
Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Premiers,  leaders  of  Salga,  delegates  to  the
National Council of Provinces and distinguished  guests.  I  did  not  know,
Chairperson, when I arrived that I was sitting next  to  such  an  important
person. [Laughter.] I would like to say thank  you  very  much  to  you  for
giving me the honour to sit next to  what  Manne  Dipico  calls  the  second
Deputy President. [Laughter.] Thank you very much for that.

I noticed, Madam Chairperson, that when the Chairperson of Salga  arrived  -
I don't know if you saw that - he did not know where  to  sit.  Fortunately,
your very efficient staff showed him where to sit, and it is  at  the  back.
He is in a corner somewhere there. I am not quite  sure,  Chairperson,  that
that's where he should sit. He represents a very important  constituency  in
our country. But I am very glad to see him here.

There was a call made  to  the  new  Deputy  Chairperson  to  make  a  mark,
following in the outstanding footsteps of a former acting  President.  I  am
glad to see that acting President present in the House. And I  think  it  is
good that there was an occasion to  note  this  exceptional  act  which  was
done, despite the fact that that acting President was in that  position  for
a few days. None of us  have  been  able  to  repeat  that.  [Laughter.]  We
continue  to  look,  Madam  Chairperson,  for  an  occasion  when  we  might
distinguish ourselves in a similar fashion. Perhaps the Eastern  Cape  might
want to act against the Free State and the Western Cape, because I  am  told
- the second Deputy Chairperson has just told me - that the Premiers of  the
Free State and the Western Cape insist on calling him  Stoffel.  [Laughter.]
I think that calls for a particular kind of intervention.

Hon Chairperson, at its Lekgotla in July, the Cabinet once more  focused  on
the critically important issue of the  struggle  against  poverty.  In  this
context, it observed that our  country  is  characterised  by  two  parallel
economies, the first and the second. It said the first  economy  is  modern,
produces the bulk of our country's wealth,  and  is  integrated  within  the
global economy.

It said the second economy, or the marginalised  economy,  is  characterised
by  underdevelopment,  contributes  little  to  the  GDP,  contains  a   big
percentage of our population, incorporates the  poorest  of  our  rural  and
urban poor, is structurally disconnected from both the first and the  global
economies, and is incapable of self-generated growth and development.

To respond to the challenge of this second economy,  we  have  examined  the
system of structural funds instituted by the European Union  in  respect  of
its regional policy, which is based on financial solidarity of  transferring
a portion of the EU's budget to  the  less  prosperous  regions  and  social
groups within the European Union.

The EU programme is premised on  the  reality  that  the  market  cannot  be
relied upon to meet the development  needs  of  the  less  favoured  regions
within  the  EU,  guarantee  the  achievement  of  the  centrally  important
objective of social cohesion, and provide the means for  the  implementation
of strategies for catching up.

In the same spirit, the Cabinet has resolved that  the  development  of  the
marginalised economy requires the infusion of capital  and  other  resources
by the democratic state to ensure the integration  of  this  economy  within
the developed sector.

The Cabinet's decisions will necessarily  involve  active  partnership  with
provincial and local governments and other social partners.  Among  the  key
strategies to meet the growth  and  development  challenges  of  the  second
economy are the Integrated and Sustainable Rural Development Programme;  the
Urban Renewal Programme; the Expanded Public Works Programme; a major  boost
to infrastructure spending, with  an  emphasis  on  improved  underdeveloped
areas  and  communities;  and  further   support   to   local   government's
preparation and implementation of Integrated Development Plans.

It also includes the development of SMMEs and co-operatives, in  both  urban
and rural areas; black economic  empowerment,  and  special  programmes  for
women's economic development; the expansion of micro-credit  to  enable  the
poorest to engage in productive economic activity; the incorporation of  the
unemployed  within  the  Skills   Development   Programme,   especially   as
implemented by the Setas; the  continued  restructuring  of  our  system  of
education so that it gives our youth  the  necessary  skills  to  engage  in
economic activities of benefit to them and to the country; agrarian  reform,
including a farmers  support  programme  and  forestry  development  in  the
interests of communities; and the  creation  of  the  echelon  of  community
development workers to help build social cohesion  in  the  second  economy,
and to help to develop strategies and forge links  that  can  transform  the
second economy.

The Cabinet made the determination that  the  advances  we  have  made  with
regard to the first economy, during our first nine years of our  liberation,
have put us  in  a  position  to  meet  the  objective  fundamental  to  our
strategic outlook, to reduce  the  numbers  of  those  dependent  on  social
grants, by enabling them to pull themselves out of poverty  by  engaging  in
gainful economic activity and exercising their right to human dignity.

In our first decade of freedom and democracy, we have had to tackle  immense
challenges with limited resources in  all  spheres  of  government.  One  of
these challenges is meeting our water requirements on a sustainable basis.

Early in November, this  month,  the  Consultative  Group  on  International
Agricultural Research launched their Challenge Programme on Water  and  Food
and warned that one in three of the  world's  people  will  be  affected  by
water shortages in the year 2005 and that the annual  crop  loss  in  Africa
could be as much as the entire grain harvest produced in the  United  States
and India.

By 2025 the consultative group predicts that sub-Saharan  Africa  will  show
the highest increase in water consumption  of  any  world  region  and  that
Africans without access to clean water, if nothing is done, will  more  than
double, to 401 million and possibly 523 million people.

This year, 2003, was designated by the United Nations as  the  International
Year of Fresh Water. We are proud of our own achievements in  providing,  as
of June this year, nine  million  residents  with  fresh,  running,  potable
water.

Following on after our highly successful hosting  of  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development, we have hosted a Commonwealth conference  on  local
government  and  we  are  implementing   intergovernmental   programmes   in
accordance with Agenda 21, Habitat and the  next  WSSD  cycle  beginning  in
2004 relating to water, sanitation, and human settlements.

It is critically important therefore that we, in South Africa,  the  largest
economy in sub-Saharan Africa, should not become complacent  and  must  take
every  possible  measure  to  ensure  that  we  implement  viable   policies
consistent with the needs of our people and these international  agreements.
These also include the Millennium Development Goals, the objectives  of  the
ILO programme, Working Out of Poverty, and the New Partnership for  Africa's
Development.

Despite our resource limitations, we are pleased to say that the  Government
has delivered services to our people in a  way  that  has  turned  the  tide
against many centuries of colonialism and  apartheid  characterised  by  the
ever-increasing impoverishment of the majority.

I would like to commend, Chairperson, to the National Council  of  Provinces
the Government's Towards a Ten-Year Review  for  consideration  and  debate.
The review frankly assesses how far we  have  come  since  we  attained  our
freedom in 1994. It provides important indicators of what we need to  do  as
we strive during our second decade of liberation  to  advance  our  goal  of
pushing back the frontiers of poverty and expanding access to a better  life
for all.

One of the clear conclusions of the review is that each and every one of  us
in the provinces,  local  government  and  traditional  authorities  has  to
continue to work together with national Government as partners in  order  to
discharge our mandate to our people to  create  a  prosperous,  healthy  and
vibrant multicultural society.

Chairperson, in the state of the nation address at  the  beginning  of  this
year, I said that we would launch an  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme  to
promote economic growth and create sustainable development.

I am pleased to report that the Department of Public  Works,  together  with
other departments, including those of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,
Agriculture, Education, Health, Social Development, and Trade and  Industry,
provincial and local governments, and civil society formations have come  up
with a comprehensive business plan, approved by the Cabinet  on  4  November
2003, which will now be implemented in phases.

This Expanded Public Works Programme is a  nationwide  programme  that  will
draw significant numbers of the unemployed into  productive  employment,  so
that workers gain skills while they are  gainfully  employed,  and  increase
their capacity to  earn  an  income  once  they  leave  the  programme.  The
Expanded Public Works Programme is targeting one million  unemployed  people
in the first five years. [Applause.]

The centrepiece of the EPWP is a  large-scale  programme  of  using  labour-
intensive  methods  to  upgrade  rural  and   municipal   roads,   municipal
pipelines, storm-water drains and  paving  as  well  as  fencing  of  roads,
community water supply and sanitation, maintenance of Government  buildings,
housing,   schools   and   clinics,   rail    and    port    infrastructure,
electrification, and so on.

Some of the approved environmental and cultural programmes  that  will  also
contribute to the programme are the Land Care Programme  of  the  Department
of  Agriculture,  the  Faranani-  Pushing  Back  the  Frontiers  of  Poverty
Programme,  People  and  Parks,   Coastal   Care,   Sustainable   Land-based
Livelihoods, Cleaning up South Africa, Growing A Tourism Economy  -  all  of
these  programmes  are  of  the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism. It also includes the Department of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry's
Working for Water, Wetlands and Fire Programmes, and the Department of  Arts
and Culture Poverty Relief Programmes.

The critically important area of health also  forms  an  important  part  of
that Public Works Programme and includes the Department  of  Health's  home-
based care workers, the Department of Social  Development's  community-based
care and support workers, and the Department of Education's early  childhood
development workers.
The  economic  sector  Public  Works  Programme  initiatives   include   the
Department of Agriculture's agricultural and  community  production  centres
and the Departments of Labour  and  Trade  and  Industry's  micro-enterprise
development and venture learnership programmes.

The success of the programme will depend on how  well  all  our  spheres  of
government will work together as partners to achieve  practical  results.  I
would like to share with you a concrete example of  an  existing  provincial
Public Works project, which is helping to  give  hope  to  desperately  poor
communities.  There  are  plans  to  replicate  this  programme   in   other
provinces.

I refer here to the Zibambele programme that was initiated in  2000  by  the
KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture,  and  I  am  sure  Premier  Mtshali
might speak about this. Its objectives are to maintain the province's  rural
road network and to provide  poor  rural  households  which  have  no  other
source of income with a regular  income.  The  programme  is  based  on  the
``length person'' contract  system,  which  has  been  used  extensively  in
Europe and Southern Africa. In the year 2002-03 there were approximately  10
000 Zibambele  contractors,  maintaining  approximately  one  third  of  the
KwaZulu-Natal rural road network. In return for eight days of work a  month,
maintaining a length of road to an agreed standard,  households  received  a
transfer of R334 per month.

The part-time nature of the work, which may be carried out  flexibly  within
the month, is designed to accommodate  engagement  in  household  tasks  and
other wage or subsistence opportunities, should they arise.

The work is allocated on a household basis, so  that  if  the  participating
household member  becomes  unavailable,  another  member  may  take  up  the
activity, and thus retain the monthly income. Households  are  selected  for
participation at a district level by representatives of the local  community
and by the elected Rural Road Transport  Fora  using  criteria  of  poverty,
unemployment and female or child-headed households.
The scheme was initially reliant on support from external  consultants,  but
in-house management and implementation capacity has been developed  and  the
use of external consultants has been  reduced.  The  department  planned  to
extend the number of contractors to  14  000  by  the  end  of  the  2002-03
financial year and, ultimately, to a maximum of 40 000 poor households.  The
budget for Zibambele in 2002-03 was R55,7 million.

A recent study has concluded that the programme is cost-effective  in  terms
of transferring resources from the state to recipients,  the  proportion  of
programme costs spent on labour and the cost of  the  creation  of  a  day's
work. This is based on work that was done by Anna McCord at  the  University
of Cape Town, at Saldru.

This study has also pointed out that if Zibambele were  expanded  nationally
and focused just on the maintenance  of  the  38%  of  the  provincial  road
network estimated to be in poor condition, approximately 135 000 jobs  could
be created on the basis of employing one worker per kilometre, at a cost  of
R691 million per annum. Zibambele is  a  clear  example  of  best  practice,
which can be drawn on in the Expanded Public Works Programme.

The Limpopo province has also taken the initiative to implement this  Public
Works Programme in its road infrastructure projects,  under  the  banner  of
its Gundo Lashu programme, which in Tshivenda is ``Our Victory''.

This is resulting in six  times  more  local  employment  creation  than  if
conventional machine-intensive construction methods were used,  without  any
significant overall increase in costs, and without sacrificing  the  quality
of the roads being built.

The workers on the projects are also provided with training,  with  the  aim
of increasing their potential to  earn  an  income  once  the  projects  are
completed. By the end of the next financial year, the contractors will  have
completed 500 km of rural roads, and created 500 000 person  days  of  local
employment.
A recent review by the  British  Department  for  International  Development
concluded that ``the demonstration of the viability of labour-based  methods
is likely to be completely achieved'' in the Gundo Lashu programme.

Working for Water, with  a  budget  of  about  R30  million,  has  over  300
projects around the country, operating in all provinces,  and  currently  is
providing work and training opportunities for some 21 000 people.  There  is
a strong focus on those living in  poverty,  with  concomitant  support  for
black economic empowerment,  women,  youth,  people  with  disabilities  and
single-parent households, among others.

Growing out of the Working for Water programme  have  been  several  aligned
programmes. The Working on Fire programme is  providing  training  and  work
opportunities to a similar targeted group of people,  to  help  prevent  and
fight fires. Through the actions of the Working on Fire team, 22  people  in
KwaZulu-Natal were recently rescued from certain death.
Similarly, this programme was praised by the forestry industry  for  playing
a significant  role  in  containing  devastating  fires  in  Mpumalanga  and
elsewhere in August, which cost the country about R3 billion.

Working on Fire is piloting its work in seven  provinces  at  present,  with
the  hope  of  becoming  a  national  programme  to  address   fire   in   a
comprehensive and co-ordinated manner. It has a R20 million grant per  annum
from Working  for  Water,  supplemented  by  significant  support  from  the
private sector.

The Working for Wetlands programme is similarly providing training and  work
opportunities in the rehabilitation of wetlands. And indeed, Chairperson,  I
think it is a fine example of co-operative governance, working across  three
national departments, that is the Department of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry and the Department  of
Agriculture, the provincial governments, local government  and  the  private
sector.
These are a few examples of  how  Government  has  been  taking  progressive
steps with our  social  partners  to  address  significant  threats  to  our
social, economic and ecological wellbeing. Indeed, we are  implementing  our
programmes in a pro-poor, transformation-orientated manner.

Chairperson, the youth of our country are significant  stakeholders  in  our
reconstruction and development plans. They are part of  our  population  and
many of them fall in the category of  the  ``economically  active''.  Across
all levels of government, we are striving  to  ensure  that  the  youth  are
given the opportunity to create wealth and income  for  themselves  and  for
our country.

A lot of energy has gone into infusing a youth development approach  in  the
public delivery system, though  the  results,  clearly,  are  still  uneven.
Through the National Youth Commission and the Umsobomvu Youth  Fund  it  has
been possible to provide guidance to departments and  interact  with  senior
managers to ensure that youth development  is  supported  internally  within
the structures of Government.

Youth development must become  an  integral  part  of  what  we  do  in  the
provinces and municipalities. And youth development and  participation  must
form part of our integrated development plans.

The partnership between the National Youth Commission, the  Umsobomvu  Youth
Fund and the South African Youth Council has developed a strong impetus  for
the decisions we took in terms of establishing and implementing  a  National
Youth Service. In the coming  months,  we  must  scale  the  National  Youth
Service upwards, from pilot  service  projects  administered  through  these
three partners into a  coherent  national  effort  involving  key  national,
provincial and local governments.

Other innovative interventions that can and must  be  made  to  address  the
challenges of the second economy are also exemplified by the  public-private
partnership  ICT  initiative  between  the  Limpopo  province,   Mogalakwena
District Municipality and Hewlett Packard. This exciting programme is  using
modern  communication  and  information   technology   to   bring   allround
development to the Mogalakwena rural area. We must work to expand this  kind
of programme to other rural areas.

The March 2003 Labour Force Survey of Stats SA showed that two  million  new
jobs were created in the previous seven  and  a  half  years,  bringing  the
total of those employed to  11,6  million.  This  represents  an  employment
growth rate of over 2,5% per year. However, as  indicated  in  the  Ten-Year
Review, the numbers of those joining  the  labour  market  has  grown  at  a
faster rate. Demographic changes, such as more  women  entering  the  labour
market, have also intensified the  need  for  our  economy  and  society  to
create more jobs.

Our macroeconomic policies and microeconomic interventions  have  helped  to
place our public finances and  the  first  economy  on  a  radically  better
footing than they were in 1994. These improvements have helped  to  generate
the resources we need to address the challenge of the second  economy.  This
also means that we must persist in our work to  ensure  the  further  growth
and development and  modernisation  of  the  first  economy,  including  its
capacity to absorb larger numbers of workseekers.

This also relates to the important  issue  of  black  economic  empowerment,
which remains one of the priorities of  our  Government,  both  to  end  the
racial disparities in our economy and society and to address  the  challenge
of poverty and underdevelopment. Government has also made  significant  sums
of money available for this empowerment. The  state  corporations  are  also
important partners in this regard.

The adoption of the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment  Bill  will  also
help to expedite the process  of  this  empowerment.  Government  and  black
business  have  already  held  a  two-day  indaba  to  follow  up  on   this
development.

The fact of this indaba emphasised the need for our Government  to  continue
to interact with a broad cross-section of our people further  to  strengthen
the people's contract to build the kind of people-centred  society  that  we
all want. Once again, the Ten-Year Review emphasised  the  need  for  us  to
strengthen this people's contract, pointing to challenges we face to  ensure
that our social partners perform  to  capacity  and  in  a  manner  that  is
consistent with the agreements they enter into.

The successful Growth and Development Summit held  last  June  served  as  a
positive signal of the ability of South Africans to work  together  to  meet
our economic goals.

Chairperson, the Government is paying the closest attention  to  the  proper
functioning of the Presidential Working Groups, further to  consolidate  the
people's contract for a better future. And these working groups  create  the
possibility for an ongoing dialogue between Government  and  representatives
of civil society formations, business  and  trade  unions.  As  the  Council
knows, they include the Big  Business  Working  Group,  the  Black  Business
Working Group, the Commercial Agriculture Working Group, the  trade  unions,
religious leaders,  the  Higher  Education  Working  Group,  and  the  Youth
Working Group.

I am pleased to report  to  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  that  our
dialogue with these various working groups has been  highly  successful.  We
are considering the publication of a  report  to  the  nation  covering  the
areas dealt with by these working groups as a practical example of how  much
our people are giving practical expression to the need for  all  our  people
to come together in the people's  contract  of  which  we  have  spoken,  to
confront the challenges we face as a country.

On 6 May, we established the Higher Education  Working  Group  to  create  a
shared understanding of the challenges of transformation that  confront  our
universities  and  technikons.  It  is  critically  important   that   these
institutions produce the relevantly qualified and  skilled  people  that  we
require to build our society and economy, and sustain our drive  to  advance
ours as a winning nation.
Recently we also launched the Youth Working Group directly  to  engage  this
important sector of our society. We also hope to engage in the  near  future
with another very significant constituency - the women,  who  represent  the
majority of our population. Consultations are proceeding to  establish  this
Women's Working Group.

Since April 2001, the Presidency has engaged with the masses of  our  people
across South Africa in the form of imbizo's. This year, we have gone to  the
provinces of the North West and the Western Cape. We  still  have  to  visit
KwaZulu-Natal, the Northern Cape and Mpumalanga.

The imbizo's have given all of us a unique and  personal  insight  into  the
lives of the masses of our people who have elected us into office.  Our  top
priority is to ascertain what the  actual  needs  of  our  people  are;  how
efficient the delivery of services at all levels of government  is,  and  to
address whatever problems arise; and whether Government's policies have  had
a positive and regenerative impact on our communities.
In all provinces, we heard compelling personal stories of genuine  concerns,
and yet we also encountered real progress and partnerships between the  rich
and the poor, the young and the old, men and  women  -  and  indeed,  it  is
inspiring to witness at first hand the spirit of Vukuzenzele.

These direct interactions with the ordinary masses  of  our  people  are  an
important part of the process of building  and  strengthening  the  people's
contract for a better future. That people's contract will have meaning  only
if it impacts on these masses to transform their lives. That is  why  it  is
critically important that we  constantly  listen  to  what  the  people  are
saying and work with them to encourage their involvement in the struggle  to
change their lives for the better.

In this regard, I would like to express my sincere appreciation of the  work
done  by  this  Council,  and   the   elected   provincial   and   municipal
representatives to reach out to the people through  their  own  iimbizo.  We
must sustain this work and ensure that we  follow  up  on  the  observations
made by the people to confirm that we  are  truly  committed  to  a  people-
driven process of social transformation.

Similarly, we must continue to  work  both  to  refine  and  strengthen  our
system of intergovernmental relations and improve  our  governance  capacity
in all spheres of our government. A  strong  and  effective  system  of  co-
operative government is one of the keys to our further  advance  during  our
second decade of  liberation.  Equally,  we  need  a  strong  and  effective
people's contract to meet the challenges of the decisive  second  decade  of
liberation.

This second decade of liberation will be decisive for our  country,  because
it will determine whether we succeed to meet the  challenges  posed  by  the
existence of the second economy. I am certain that we will  meet  our  goals
in this regard.

But equally, I am certain that we will not  achieve  this  historic  victory
unless we join hands in a  truly  meaningful  manner,  in  a  real  people's
contract that unites the majority of our people in action to  eradicate  the
legacy of colonialism and apartheid.

Hopefully, in the debate which follows in  this  House,  we  will  have  the
opportunity to address areas of mutual concern to ensure that  we  formulate
and implement policies and programmes  in  which  the  people  in  all  nine
provinces and all our municipalities play an active and significant role.

We must move forward together  in  unity  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, to expand access to  a  better  life  for  all,  and  to  extricate
millions of our people from  the  second  economy  which  condemns  them  to
poverty, underdevelopment, marginalisation and the loss of human dignity.

And  I  am  quite  certain,  Chairperson,  that  this  National  Council  of
Provinces will play a central role in achieving these  objectives.  I  thank
you very much. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy  Chairperson,  I  listened  to  the  hon
President with some care when he  made  reference  to  the  seating  of  the
Chairperson of Salga. I have to say to the hon President that I  thought  to
myself, ``If only we could have him more often in the House, sir;  we  would
attract the numbers that you see before you because we never lack for  seats
on any occasion, except when  the  President  of  South  Africa  is  in  the
House.''

My mother passed away just over a year ago. I remember early  last  year  we
were having a conversation and she was telling me  about  the  protests  and
demonstrations that they used to  engage  in  as  young  people  at  Loveday
College, and then at Fort Hare when they were at university. She said to  me
in a little whisper of a voice: ``You know, when we were at Lovedale, and  I
was in my last year at high  school,  we  had  a  very  strong  protest  and
demonstration as students, and we had a song we used  to  sing:  Freedom  in
Our Lifetime!'' She kept singing this refrain to me  and  said:  ``While  we
sang it, we hoped for freedom in our lifetime, but over the decades I  began
to believe it was not possible.'' And  she  said:  ``I'm  so  happy  that  I
actually saw freedom in my lifetime!''

I think, in reviewing these ten  years  of  democracy,  we  must  thank  the
leaders of this country that indeed we have had  freedom  in  our  lifetime.
[Applause.] I would like, in making a small contribution - and I  thank  the
Whips for affording me the opportunity  -  to  reflect  on  these  years  of
democracy, but to more particularly look at the  institution  of  Parliament
and its contribution to our democratic success.

I  attended  a  meeting  recently  of  African  Commonwealth  Speakers   and
Presiding Officers. We spent a great deal of time and attention on  debating
the status of parliaments in the emerging fabric of  an  African  commitment
to democracy, good governance and progress.  Several  participants  referred
to the easy manner in which  democracy,  good  governance  and  transparency
roll off our tongues, and the sad reality that there  are  parliaments  that
are  often  a  caricature  of   democracy,   resplendent   in   design   but
unfortunately impoverished in practice.

Do parliaments, it was asked, have  a  place  in  advancing  democracy?  Are
parliaments merely places where acolytes serve the executive in the hope  of
a ministerial appointment? Can  Presiding  Officers  and  the  executive  be
relied on to strengthen parliaments so that they  more  effectively  promote
the public interest rather than party-political advantage?

As often happens in such meetings, the colleagues asked South Africa,  as  a
newer and so perhaps, in their view, less tainted democracy, to  reflect  on
its experience and respond to these important issues. Some of the  responses
that  we  gave  are  an  interesting  commentary  on  our  first  decade  of
parliamentary democracy.

Firstly, we stressed that democracy should neither be confused  with  voting
nor with winning or  losing  elections.  Our  constitutional  framework,  we
said, clearly provides for the protection of civil and political  liberties;
promotes respect for law, for free discussion;  and  facilitates  access  to
Government plans and policies.

In our view, we  said,  democracy  is  about  the  intrinsic  importance  of
political participation and freedom in human life;  it  is  also  about  the
instrumental importance  of  political  incentives  in  keeping  governments
responsible and accountable; and it is also about the constructive  role  of
democracy in the formation of values and  in  the  understanding  of  needs,
rights and duties.

Given that  these  important  features  of  democracy  are  encoded  in  our
Constitution, we were able to state that our Parliament has indeed played  a
central role in  promoting  and  developing  democracy.  We  confirmed  that
Parliament is a forum for debate on vital national issues. And  all  of  us,
as Presiding Officers of South  Africa,  agreed  that  our  parliaments  are
indeed important talk shops.

Secondly, we indicated that Parliament acts to hold the executive organs  of
state to account, not entirely effectively as yet but we try.  Thirdly,  our
Parliament passes legislation and, in doing so,  ensures  public  access  to
policy debates and full attention to the careful crafting of national law.

Fourthly, our Parliament is also  innovatory  in  its  promotion  of  gender
equality  as  a  precondition  for  deepening   democracy   and   generating
sustainable development. Gender equality,  we  stressed,  is  not  merely  a
desirable by-product of human development; it is a  core  goal  in  its  own
right. All in all, there is no doubt in our own mind that our  system  today
is an incomparable improvement on what it replaced.

Colleagues vigorously challenged me on this positive  report  and  asked  me
for an outline of the rationale for  this  character  I  was  outlining.  My
response stressed that South Africa's constitutional design has  given  life
to the emergence of a viable parliamentary democracy.  Parliament,  and  all
the legislatures, are premised on the notions of  inclusivity,  respect  for
diversity,  openness,  accountability,   multipartyism,   co-operation   and
decision by logical consensus. The structure of legislative governance,  and
of Parliament in particular, places our democracy on firm ground. I  claimed
that the key to our success lies in the concept of co-operative  governance.
We cited the model of the National Council of Provinces as an example.

In May 1998, barely a year after the Council was established,  Mr  President
- you were then Mr Deputy President - you addressed  a  national  conference
on the role of the National Council of Provinces. I think at that  time  you
called the National  Council  of  Provinces  ``our  unique  contribution  to
democracy''. You asked then  how  we  should  measure  the  success  of  the
national Council. You  suggested  that  the  number  of  Bills  modified  or
rejected should not be the measure  of  success.  The  reason  for  this  is
because our Constitution, as you said, is designed around the concept of co-
operative, and not competitive governance.

You suggested, Mr President, firstly, that success could be measured by  how
effectively the national Council was in reviewing provincial  and  municipal
interventions; and secondly, whether the provinces were using  the  national
Council to participate more  effectively  in  national  policy  formulation.
That is, Mr President, you suggested that the House be  judged  not  on  its
role on passing Bills,  but  on  its  role  in  reviewing  intergovernmental
oversight functions.  The  NCOP  is  the  hinge  around  which  co-operative
governance swings; or, in our mind, it should be.

Back then in 1998, in response to your comments,  you  were  told  that  the
provinces regarded the Council as an add-on, but that the  national  Council
itself had been extremely successful in its review of the  one  intervention
in Butterworth, at that time. There have been many interventions since  then
and the provinces have come to take a  more  enthusiastic  approach  to  the
Council as the upper House of Parliament.

But we must ask similar questions again: How effective has the Council  been
in deepening democracy? Are there any lessons that  the  African  Union  can
learn from us? In 1999 the Department for Provincial  and  Local  Government
conducted an intergovernmental audit, and their criticism of  the  NCOP  was
the following:


  A general complaint has been that the  system  is  too  complex  to  work
  effectively. As an institution articulating  the  provincial  voice,  the
  NCOP is seen to be overloaded with work and its mandate  to  debate  both
  section 75 and section 76 Bills too broad, given  its  limited  resources
  and the composition of its membership. Its composition  of  four  special
  and six permanent delegates from each of the provinces is a  handicap  in
  that the special delegates lack continuity and, more pertinently, play no
  part in the NCOP's select committee system. This leaves the processing of
  Bills to only 54 delegates - far too few to deal with the large number of
  Bills to be scrutinised. The Audit report calculated that NCOP  permanent
  members serve, on  average,  on  eight  different  select  committees  as
  opposed to their counterparts in the National Assembly who serve  on  two
  portfolio committees. Consequently, the quality of input  and  degree  of
  scrutiny may be suffering.

Despite these  negative  comments  which  do,  I  believe,  require  serious
consideration, today I can say the following. The strengths of  the  Council
lie in a number of characteristics: in allowing for the  reflection  of  the
provincial voice; in holding the executive accountable; in the  accumulation
of a pool of knowledge about the provinces that does not exist in any  other
institution;  in  a  better  understanding  among  permanent  delegates  and
provincial representatives of the national constitution than members in  any
other House of Parliament because of the unique position  that  the  Council
occupies in intergovernmental relations; in that the  smaller  size  of  the
NCOP is conducive to more supportive relations between members, parties  and
staff than is the case in  any  other  legislature;  and  in  the  excellent
liaison we have developed with  the  other  House,  especially  through  our
committee chairpersons.

The weaknesses of the House lie in the following: the  current  practice  of
public hearings which limit our liaison with civil  society;  a  low  public
profile; the lack of an integrated oversight process because  the  House  is
so much smaller than the other House; an inadequate  identification  of  the
provincial interest; and a  poor  working  relationship  with  the  national
executive in the tabling and formulation of debates in the  House,  as  well
as in our failure to make better use of Budget debates.

How then can we improve legislative intergovernmental relations  and  deepen
democracy?  Some,  who   have   criticised,   state   that   the   executive
intergovernmental relations undermine the democratic process in this  House.
They often say that the Minmecs work so  well  that  actually  there  is  no
effective  space  or  need  for  debate  in  the  national  Council  on  the
provincial issues which have already been articulated and  resolved  by  the
executive branch. Although this is said, we have no  factual  evidence  that
this assertion is true; but we must consider these criticisms if we  are  to
deepen democracy.

There are two suggestions that I  believe  deserve  consideration.  Firstly,
regarding  the  designation  of  delegates  in  the  National   Council   of
Provinces, we use a complicated formula. It had to  be  complicated  because
we were starting an institution and  not  quite  knowing  the  direction  in
which we would proceed.

We have national and provincial lists in our  electoral  system  to  present
candidates  for  election  in  the  National  Assembly  and  the  provincial
legislatures. There is no list for the National Council of  Provinces.  This
has become a problem in that it effectively means that the national  Council
is apparently composed of those candidates who do not  make  the  grade  for
the National Assembly or a provincial legislature.  Effectively,  it  means,
in the view of many, that the National Council of  Provinces  delegates  are
the third team. This cannot be good for an upper House of Parliament. It  is
time that we considered  alternative  ways  of  electing  delegates  to  the
National Council of Provinces so that its profile reflects  the  vital  role
that we have given it in intergovernmental relations. [Applause.]

Secondly, we need to consider ways of deepening  democracy  by  raising  the
profile  of  legislative  intergovernmental  relations.  Can  this  be  done
without affecting executive intergovernmental relations? The answer  is  not
clear, but we have to find a response to it. I do not believe it is a  zero-
sum equation. I do not think we should abolish Minmecs.  We  cannot  and  do
not want to abolish them, but either  procedurally  or  through  the  Budget
process,  we  can  enhance  the  NCOP's  ability   to   influence   national
legislation.

The design of  our  democracy,  as  the  inclusive  diverse  unity  that  we
described at the Commonwealth Presiding Officers' Conference,  augurs  well,
in our view, for African efforts to build a lasting  democracy.  We  believe
we will be able to make important contributions to the  African  Union,  New
Partnership for Africa's Development and to the Pan-African  Parliament.  We
will take to those  institutions  our  experience  that  democracy  requires
concrete constitutional expression; that development is reliant on tools  of
accountability that are transparent and open to review and  validation;  and
that the values of good governance  are  values  that  are  synonymous  with
democracy.

Our experience of over nine years of parliamentary democracy tells  us  that
the constitutional status of Parliament  is  a  significant  contributor  to
building  a  sustainable  democracy.   It   also   identifies   co-operative
governance  and  concrete  structural  relationships   across   spheres   as
necessary elements for the achievement of consensus and national unity.

Values that underpin parliamentary practice must also  receive  attention  -
respect  for  diversity,  parliamentary   prominence   rather   than   party
prominence, and the existence of a form  of  parliament  in  which  all  the
people have a voice and  an  opportunity  to  make  an  impact  on  national
discourse.
I could not answer the rather more difficult questions of the  role  of  big
majorities and the sweaty palms occasioned by ministerial ambitions,  but  I
believe my colleagues eventually accepted my assertion that  in  these  nine
years and more,  our  Parliament  has  indeed  played  a  singular  role  in
providing firm building blocks for a viable democracy, and that we have  the
base to continue to do so. Thank you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF LIMPOPO (Adv N A Ramatlhodi):  Deputy  Chair,  our  President
and colleagues, I can't resist the temptation to respond to what  the  Chair
was saying about  the  system  of  bringing  delegates  here.  The  argument
sounds, to me, fundamentally flawed in the sense that when we  created  this
institution, the idea was not to reproduce the old Senate. The idea  was  to
create a forum for people in provinces to come to meet here. So,  from  that
point of view, without really having all the facts, it  just  sounds  a  bit
flawed.

Nevertheless, let me respond to the speech of the President, which was  very
enlightening and which was excellent. I  just  want  to  talk  a  bit  about
Limpopo - the Third World of  South  Africa,  as  I  describe  it.  This  is
because you do have Third and Second Worlds in one country.

I'll tell you a story which will illustrate the difficulties  that  we  were
faced with. It must have been in 1992 - I was still at the  headquarters  of
the ANC - when we were called together with the former President to rush  to
Lebowa. When we arrived there, the chief Minister told us  that  his  police
were at the border facing the police from  Gazankulu,  armed  with  pistols,
trying to make war.

I am telling this story because we were such a  diversified  and  fragmented
province in 1994. By the way, that area, which was  the  Northern  Transvaal
then, was also the only place where the white voters  in  South  Africa  had
voted no in the referendum for change. We found four  governments  there  in
1994. I am glad to say that today, as we speak,  we  have  one  Limpopo  and
that it works and functions well.

I do not want to dwell on the administrative problems of files and files  of
civil servants packed in dark rooms somewhere, no computer system,  nothing.
All that is water under the bridge.  I  want  to  thank  colleagues  in  the
national Government, the Presidency and colleagues in  the  other  provinces
for really supporting us to deal with a rather difficult situation.

So, that success there cannot be attributed only to the people  of  Limpopo,
because through, in fact, collectively exchanging ideas  and  experiences  -
sharing - we eventually produced the product that we have.

We inherited a  debt  from  the  previous  administration  -  excluding  the
parastatals - of R1,4 billion. By our last budget, this year,  we  had  paid
it off, all that debt.  This  means  that  we  have  made  quite  a  lot  of
progress. We are beginning to save money and to put it where  it  can  begin
to impact on the lives of our people. [Applause.]

When we started, the pass rate for matriculants was 32%.  By  last  year  it
was 78%, so we have turned the corner. We have begun the  journey.  When  we
started we were rated ``G'', as it was then referred to,  and  the  economic
growth rate was at minus something. By last year we had reached  well  above
5% in our growth rate.

I want to talk about the interventions of the parastatals and  the  national
departments in, for instance, electrification. If you  fly  over  that  vast
area at night, it is very difficult to tell  where  a  town  or  a  city  is
because the villages are alight, and so on. That is why I am saying that  by
working together we were able to deliver a better life for our people.

Regarding the question  of  water  provision,  there  has  been  significant
improvement. There is work that must still be done, but no one would  surely
be telling the truth if he or she were to say that we have  not  begun  that
job.

We have worked on and have been guided  by  what  we  have  developed  as  a
growth and development strategy for Limpopo, or Vision 2020 as we  call  it.
That vision has guided us over the years and in terms of it,  amongst  other
things, we have envisaged a situation in which we do  co-operative  work  on
the ground. We put people together who work, for  instance,  on  farms  like
Zebediela. We put them there because these are Government farms and we  make
them the people's farms. We then  bring  in  the  villagers  and  thereafter
South  Africans  experienced  in  farming  -  without  reference  to   their
ideological positions - such as Dries Bruwer. I'm sure you would  know  him.
We bring  them  in  to  partner  with  our  people  and  to  pass  on  their
experience. They also bring in resources, and that  is  how  we  managed  to
send oranges to the World Cup the other day from the Zebediela estate  which
had become nonproductive.

We are doing another interesting  co-operative  with  chickens  at  a  lower
level. You have a co-operative, then you have  a  slaughterhouse,  then  you
have a high level. So this is a chain  linking  up  these  co-operatives  so
that they work together and begin to synergise.  This  is  so  that  we  can
create more jobs. I think the President has referred to Gundo  Lashu,  so  I
won't talk about it.

I'd like to say, before I conclude, that if you want to see the progress  we
have made in Limpopo over the past years, you  must  go  to  Mafefe  on  the
Olifants River. For over 100 or so years, people have  been  using  what  is
called Sewayawaya - the cable car -  to  cross  the  great  Olifants  River.
These people are children going to school, and people bringing  coffins  and
all those sorts of things. They couldn't cross that river. They had  to  use
a cable to cross it. If you go to Mafefe today you will find that  there  is
a brand new bridge beautifully settled next to the  Sewayawaya.  Our  people
have made a beginning. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF GAUTENG (Mr M S Shilowa): Chairperson, the President  of  the
Republic, the  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  hon  members  of  the  NCOP  and
Ministers, when the Premier of Limpopo was speaking about  there  being  the
First, Second and Third World in the economy, I am  on  the  third  side  of
what he was referring to, on the other side of Limpopo. I  look  forward  to
when that area also joins the first and the second economies.

I think maybe I should take on board some of the issues that were raised  in
the House. Let me start with the point which I think Premier Ramatlhodi  was
responding to. My view is that there  are  various  ways  in  which  we  can
respond to the point that is being raised. I think the way we respond to  it
is to call on all political parties not to wait until the lists  and  people
have gone through into the NA Legislature, to then say that  those  who  are
left will go to the NCOP. We  should  rather  be  able  to  designate  right
upfront as political parties that, regardless of what numbers we get,  these
are the people that we are going to send to the NCOP.  That  is  really  the
point that she was making. If we deal with it in that way, we will  then  be
able to constitute the NCOP  in  accordance  with  ideas  that  were  raised
before. I really want to urge political parties  to  take  these  issues  on
board.
Secondly, I thought that as part of the  response  to  the  hon  President's
input today, we should consider the NCOP as being the imbizo in which  there
are many stakeholders, coming here  to  talk  about  how  their  lives  have
changed or not changed over the past ten years. We should  accept  the  fact
that there will be  critics  who  will  always  argue  that  the  democratic
Government has not achieved what it had promised. There will always be  some
who will even go so far as saying that indeed the democratic Government  has
brought misery to millions of South Africans.

But if we were to have that imbizo here, the majority  of  the  participants
who represent the overwhelming majority of South Africans would  acknowledge
that all policies and programmes that we have been implementing  since  1994
have taken forward our vision of a new South  Africa,  as  outlined  in  the
policy documents - the Freedom Charter and the RDP,  amongst  others.  Those
who spent decades living in slums will say that the democratic South  Africa
has brought about better lives for them, because they  now  live  in  decent
homes built on land that they proudly own.

If you have always had a home and have never lived on  the  river  banks  of
Alexandra - or inside the river in Alexandra - the  move  to  an  RDP  house
means very little to you. I think  we  have  to  begin  to  understand  that
sometimes those people are raising  these  issues  and  disagreeing  because
they just can't comprehend  how  somebody  could  say  that  they  now  have
dignity when they are simply moving from a slum to what they  would  call  a
one-roomed or a two-roomed house.

If we were having an imbizo, many who did not have  access  to  health  care
will say that South Africa is now a better place because  they  have  access
to quality care near  where  they  live.  Again,  if  you  have  always  had
hospitals and clinics near where you live, you have no conceptualisation  of
these changes. But people who have had to walk very  long  distances,  whose
family members have died because they  could  not  access  hospitals,  would
better understand what these changes mean.
Parents who could not give their a children decent education, would say,  if
this were an imbizo, that the democratic South Africa is a better place  for
their children, because the democratic Government has opened  the  doors  of
learning to all. Now this is not to say there would not be children in  some
parts of our country who learn under trees. The fact of the matter  is  that
we can say with dignity that we have been able to extend education to all.

If you live in the rural parts of Gauteng - by the way, Rev Stofile,  we  do
have rural parts in Gauteng, even though I always  refer  to  those  as  the
peri-urban areas - you know that your children had no access  to  schooling,
let alone a farm school. As we speak here today, they now have free  scholar
transport to go to school, wherever their school may be. You can then  begin
to understand the changes that have taken place.  But,  of  course,  if  you
have always had access to a school, the changes mean nothing to you.

Many of the most vulnerable of our people, who previously could not get  any
help from the state, including poor parents who could not afford to  support
their children, will say that the democratic South Africa is a better  place
because they now receive social security grants.

Millions who did not have  access  to  basic  services  such  as  water  and
electricity, especially those who live in  the  rural  areas,  will  testify
that South Africa is now a better place than it was in  1994,  because  they
now have access to free basic amounts of water and electricity. For  workers
who have had to participate in, among other things, the 1973  Durban  strike
that spread over to the East Rand and other parts, who have had to win  some
of their rights through the Wiehahn Commission, who have had to  go  through
a number  of  strikes,  with  further  changes  being  made  to  the  Labour
Relations Act in 1988, whose leadership has had to  stage  sit-ins  in  1990
around issues of worker rights, when  they  say  that  today  with  the  new
legislation in terms of worker rights, enshrined in the supreme law  of  the
court - the Constitution - you now have a better understanding of  why,  for
them, this is indeed a better life.
Indeed, the unemployed will also be  able  to  say  that  they  do  know  of
relatives who have benefited from programmes  such  as  the  ones  we  spoke
about in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Gauteng province  under  Zivuseni.  They
also  know  of  work  around  labour  -  intensive  programmes  -  and  they
themselves look forward to the implementation of the expanded  Public  Works
Programme, the employment of  the  community  development  workers  and  the
implementation of learnerships and internships, so that they, too, can  find
employment.

Indeed, businesspeople - both black and white  -  who  previously  found  it
difficult to do business in our country because of the unfriendly  apartheid
laws, would also be able to say that indeed South Africa is a  better  place
to live in because of what the democratic Government, working together  with
them, has been able to do.

If we had an imbizo where women were present  here  today,  those  who  were
never treated with respect and dignity  during  apartheid,  they  would  say
that South Africa is now a better place because their rights  are  enshrined
in the Constitution. Our programmes and policies have resulted  in  a  sharp
increase in the number of women who occupy decision-making positions in  all
spheres of society.

Similarly with the youth of our country, many of whom were  neglected  under
apartheid rule, they would say that South  Africa  is  now  a  better  place
because the democratic Government has implemented  programmes  that  advance
their interests and has created  many  opportunities  for  them  to  acquire
skills that will make them worthier citizens of their country.

Even children, I would venture to say, who were born free, and who  may  not
know what life under apartheid was, will say that South Africa is  a  better
place. They can see that their Government  is  doing  everything  to  secure
their future.

The senior citizens, especially the blacks who were victims  of  apartheid's
racial old age policies, will say that South Africa is now  a  better  place
than it was before 1994, as they are now enjoying equal treatment  and  care
from the democratic Government.

Again, if in the old apartheid South Africa you used to receive your  social
pension once every month, the change means nothing. If you  are  an  African
male or female who received a R100 social pension  once  every  two  months,
the fact that it has now moved to R700 on a  monthly  basis  can  only  mean
nothing else but a revolution that has become very successful.

These are some of the things which we think it is important always  to  bear
in mind. Indeed it may be that as the old South Africa recedes  further  and
further, and memories recede, we now forget how far we have come.  We  begin
to judge the progress that we are making on the basis of  the  successes  we
have made, rather than on what it was that we inherited when  we  came  into
Government.

I am using that analogy of the imbizo because we prefer  our  judges  to  be
the people whom we were elected to  serve.  It  is  they  who  chose  us  to
implement a particular mandate. It was they  who  rejected  other  positions
and manifestos. Any call for us to implement a manifesto,  a  policy  and  a
programme for which we were never elected, is just not going to  happen.  We
use our people as judges because they know what we are doing.

Lastly, I won't repeat what I said to hon Stofile because ... ka  Sepedi  ba
re tsebe ya kgaoswi e ya ikwela. Tsebe ga e na sekhurumelo. O nkwele  morwa.
[... in Sepedi they say you have heard for yourself.  You  did  not  miss  a
thing. You have heard me, friend.]

For us as the province they remain very important. We  want  to  participate
effectively in the NCOP. To do so, we want  our  delegates  to  have  enough
time to come back to the province, to report back,  and  for  us  to  engage
with them and to give them a mandate. When they come here,  they  are  fully
representative of  the  mandate,  because  they  don't  represent  political
parties; they represent the legislature. So we  want  to  ensure  that  they
have enough time with the entire legislature. We  also  do  want  to  ensure
that national legislation is implemented without  any  reservation,  but  we
also do want to ensure that we don't end up with an unfunded mandate.

To conclude, Mr President, I would to say that the successes  we  have  made
though, bring about new challenges. The successes  for  social  grants  mean
that more people are now going for social grants, yet I think we can't  just
be happy about the successes. We have to say what resources we are going  to
make available for capital expenditure, and for infrastructure  development,
because it's only through growing the economy that we can  deal  effectively
with issues of poverty, thereby ensuring that people do not rely  solely  on
social grants. Thank you very much, Mr President. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, proudly perched on pedestals  of
privilege, ranting  and  raving,  whinging  and  whining,  reactionary  and,
regressive they resist reform. Why should we transform, ask these  renegades
of  change,  determined,  zooming  up  from  the   depth   of   deprivation,
reconciling  and  reconstructing,  empowering  and   embracing,   resilient,
relentlessly responding  to  a  new  democratic  vision.  But,  respond  the
revolutionaries of reform: So much to change!

Chairperson, hon Premiers, Speakers, Chief Whips, special delegates,  Salga,
hon President, as we gear towards a decade of freedom, we are  compelled  to
reflect on the arduous task of uniting a once divided nation. We  do  so  in
the knowledge that on the one hand there are those amongst us  who  seek  to
perpetuate the privileges of the past, and there  are  those  on  the  other
hand who relentlessly strive to transform our nation  by  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty and seeking to change the quality of the lives  of  our
people. This is the visionary and revolutionary task which  faces  us  as  a
nation. In order to achieve this there has to be  a  synthesis,  or  at  the
very least the convergence of the ideas that the task of  transformation  is
neither the responsibility nor the monopoly of one political  party  or  one
racial group.
As ten years of freedom swiftly approaches, I reminisce about  an  important
milestone on my journey: How I celebrated Freedom Day  this  year  -  a  day
which turned my soul and reignited my passion and my commitment  to  make  a
difference to the quality of the lives of our people.

Freedom Day started with a journey, as Premier Molefe would confirm, in  the
rural intellect of Orkney in the North West Province, where  the  Government
of the North West hosted our President. It was a  day  about  which  we  can
deliberately say:  ``Orkney  snork  nie.''  The  President,  addressing  the
nation, reminded us of our collective responsibility as citizens, black  and
white, to push back the frontiers of poverty, to pay  special  attention  to
social  development  and  to  ensure  an  efficient  and  effective  service
delivery. He then, as he  did  today,  expressed  the  importance  of  local
government in ensuring that the quality of the lives of our  people  changes
in a dramatic way.

More importantly, there was in his speech an invitation  to  the  nation  to
unite as one, in transforming South Africa into a prosperous  nonracial  and
nonsexist democracy. That afternoon I joined the delegation of the ANC  that
met the New NP in our capital  city,  Tshwane,  a  city  over  which  Father
Smangaliso has jurisdiction, even over the President and  his  Cabinet,  and
that is why he is quite concerned about proceedings there.

The co-operative agreement between the parties was one in which the  parties
would  mutually  commit  to  an  agenda   for   transformation,   a   shared
understanding of the need to redress the inequalities of the past and  build
a very vision of a united South Africa. Central to  this  message  were  the
remarks from our President that Government belongs to all  of  us  and  that
there  is  no   reason   for   self-inflicted   alienation   or   deliberate
polarisation,  and  further,  that  political  parties  must  together   and
collectively take executive decisions and actions to eradicate  poverty  and
affirm the dignity of all our citizens.

The messages of the morning and the afternoon of Freedom Day resonated  with
the spirit of  reconciliation  and  rebuilding.  These  were  very  powerful
messages of  unity,  consistent  with  the  ethos  and  aspirations  of  our
movement, our Constitution and our  Government.  Yet  it  is  what  occurred
after this event that gave content and meaning  to  the  humane  and  caring
nature of the leadership of the ANC. After the culmination  of  the  meeting
with the New NP, our President elected to make an unscheduled appearance  at
the park at the foot of  the  Union  Buildings  located  in  Tshwane,  where
thousands of our people had gathered to celebrate Freedom Day.

I had the privilege of joining a very small entourage  as  we  searched  for
the point of entry to the park where the festival  was  taking  place.  Upon
entering the park, as the President may recall, an old woman approached  the
President. She pointed repeatedly at her watch, gesticulating  that  he  was
late. She remonstrated and then acknowledged our President. Little  did  she
know or realised that this visit was not a visit that had been scheduled  in
the programme of the  President,  or  that  he  had  travelled  hundreds  of
kilometres from Orkney in the North West and had just finished a meeting  in
a venue located nearby. What  was  the  response  from  our  President?  Our
President did not even  try  to  explain.  Instead  he  gave  her  the  most
endearing, gentle and  disarming  smile.  The  effect  was  astounding.  She
embraced him affectionately, forgot about any grievances that  she  had  and
departed absolutely content.

Fa bagolo ba bua o tshwanetse go didimala. Seo ke tlotlo. [When  the  elders
speak, you should keep quiet. That is respect.]

Loosely translated it means: When the elders speak you must be  quiet.  This
is a sign of respect. Mr President,  you  displayed  humility,  respect  and
empathy. You understood the expectation  and  anxiety  of  an  old  citizen,
unaware  of  the  details  of  your  programme  but  nonetheless  with   the
expectation that her President would be visiting her in the capital city  of
this country.

I can imagine her, though,  reprimanding  her  grandchildren  about  keeping
time and should they dare to talk back, she would remind them  that  if  the
President could be silent when she reminded him about time,  how  dare  they
even  raise  their  voices.  People  soon  discovered  the  arrival  of  the
President.  I  soon  became  part  of  the  security  chain  protecting  the
President from a very excited group of  people  that  wanted  to  touch  and
embrace him and perhaps that is a good deployment for the future President.

Thankfully the stage was not  very  far  away.  The  news  had  reached  the
multitudes of people, made up especially of the youth, and there  was  great
excitement and expectation. It is here that another  remarkable  event  took
place. The President noticed three paraplegics at the rear of the stage  and
went to each one of them and spoke to them very briefly. The excitement  and
pleasure was clearly visible on their faces. This  occurred  away  from  the
glare of the crowds and it was an action that optimised  the  caring  nature
of a leader for his people, particularly those with disabilities.

As we stepped onto the  stage  there  was  the  finest  reception  from  the
thousands that had gathered. The President was invited to speak. Instead  he
chose to dance with Mzekezeke and Solly Moholo and his group. The  movements
were  physically  rigorous,  extremely  challenging   and   certainly   more
difficult to  accomplish  than  the  Madiba  jive.  The  crowd  roared  with
delight. Mr Ebrahim Rasool will remember this - he was  part  of  the  small
entourage that sat on  the  stage  and  really  enjoyed  the  glory  of  our
celebration and our freedom.

There was no need to superimpose a magnified image of himself on the  stage,
nor to use the platform to speak in the hope of  hearing  the  masses.  They
loved their President. As he danced he  was  in  perfect  harmony  with  his
audience and they were very  happy  that  their  President  was  celebrating
Freedom Day with them.

What is remarkable about this Government is its ability  to  reach  out  and
touch the lives of its citizens. We have a President who is  accessible  and
is constantly holding iimbizo to stay in touch with  them,  to  sustain  the
bond with our people, particularly  at  grass-roots  level.  It  is  a  rare
quality, which seldom occurs in other countries.  Mr  President,  it  was  a
privilege walking with you. It is now  my  pleasure  and  responsibility  to
follow you. The spirit of  Oliver  Tambo,  Govan  Mbeki  and  Walter  Sisulu
continues in the humaneness  and  compassion  you  have  demonstrated  as  a
leader.

As I reminisce about Freedom Day,  I  should  not  forget  to  remember  the
millions of people who laid down their lives for peace and justice  in  both
World Wars and other conflicts since then. Today is Remembrance Day  and  we
all are remembering all the women and men who died in these  conflicts,  and
we pay special tribute to the sacrifice for peace  and  justice.  It  is  in
this context that we wish also to acknowledge the  sterling  role  that  you
have played, Mr President, to achieve peace in the DRC, Rwanda and  Burundi.
We also wish to thank you for playing a  role  globally  in  areas  such  as
Palestine and Iraq.

Multilaterism was in fact the  cornerstone  for  the  establishment  of  the
United Nations. A departure from this convention  and  practice  jeopardises
the very peace and stability that we seek to achieve  under  the  banner  of
the United Nations. Peace may sometimes  appear  to  be  elusive,  but  with
determination and commitment you  have  shown  that  it  will  and  must  be
achieved.

In conclusion, I would like  to  thank  the  premiers,  as  the  leaders  of
delegations, for the support they have extended to  this  particular  House.
We also would  like  to  encourage  local  government  to  participate  more
meaningfully in the activities of the National Council of  Provinces.  There
has been significant improvement. May we also say to our departing  premiers
in terms of the constitutional provisions that you have done wonderful  work
in your provinces and we wish you the very best in the future. It  has  been
an honour and a privilege to participate in this debate.

The PREMIER OF THE WESTERN CAPE (Mr M C J  van  Schalkwyk):  Chairperson,  a
decade may be a relatively short period of time, but ten years  do  much  to
dull the memory of specific events,  specific  emotions  and  also  specific
concerns. A comparison of the headlines from November  1993  with  those  of
November 2003 speaks for itself. Let me ask you to recall with me  this  day
a decade ago - Thursday, 11 November 1993.

One headline in a local Afrikaans paper, Die Burger, of  11  November  1993,
as translated, read: ``Crisis  SA  close  to  war''.  We  had  no  finalised
Constitution and we had no culture of human rights. South Africa  was  still
in shock about the assassination of the late Chris Hani. It was a  month  in
which 351 South Africans died as a result of political violence. Today  that
is unthinkable.  It  was  the  month  that  all  soldiers  had  their  leave
cancelled because of the explosive situation of tension. It was  two  months
after the revelations of a right-wing plot to kill the  late  Peter  Mokaba,
whose ``Kill the Boer, kill the farmer'' call  was  a  frequent  refrain  in
that year. It was five months after  a  group  of  AWB  right-wing  fanatics
drove an armoured vehicle  through  the  front  doors  of  the  World  Trade
Centre. Many of us were there that day during the  multiparty  negotiations,
raising serious concerns about a right-wing military coup  attempt.  It  was
four months before the AWB and Constand Viljoen marched into  Bophuthatswana
to support Lucas Mangope.

However, 11 November 1993 was by no means a time without hope.  It  was  two
days before Chester Williams made his debut in a  match  against  Argentina.
It was a week before the interim Constitution was adopted. It  was  a  month
after the UN introduced its resolution on the lifting of economic  sanctions
against South Africa. And it was five months after the  date  had  been  set
for the first democratic elections and  five  months  before  the  elections
themselves.

Next Tuesday we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the adoption  of  the
interim  Constitution.  On  the  morning  of  18  November  1993,  the  then
President De Klerk had just outlined the final deal on power-sharing  to  an
emergency Cabinet meeting. After he finished, Dr Tertius Delport,  currently
a DA Member of Parliament, allegedly grabbed the President by the  front  of
his shirt and shrieked: ``What have you  done?  You've  given  South  Africa
away!''

That attitude  and  approach  still  characterise  some  of  the  right-wing
parties in South Africa today who are being dragged  kicking  and  screaming
into the new  South  Africa.  [Laughter.]  They  continue  to  believe  that
equality  for  all  means  that  white  South  Africans  have  somehow  been
diminished, when in fact all South Africans have been affirmed.

The historic  agreement  on  the  interim  Constitution  initially  included
primarily the ANC and the then NP. Some parties opted not be  part  of  that
agreement, for different reasons of course.

Although we are in 2003 a nation both bursting  with  potential  and  pride,
there remain those who would return our people to the mistakes of the  past.
Let me read to you from a letter published  only  a  few  days  ago  in  the
Citizen newspaper: ``President  Mbeki  represents  the  greatest  threat  to
black people in this country.'' In a reference to Mr Mandela and  Archbishop
Emeritus Tutu, the letter writer continues: ``Once these icons  of  humanity
and  reconciliation  have  gone,  he  [President  Mbeki]  will  be  free  to
accelerate the destruction of the whites to  the  applause  of  his  brother
Mugabe.''

I'm quite sure that the President and the ANC can fend for  themselves,  but
this kind of racial venom stokes the fires of racial hatred in South  Africa
and it undercuts the building of our one nation. The letter was not  written
by a member of the Boeremag or the AWB  or  the  Freedom  Front-Conservative
Party alliance, but by a public representative of the  DA.  [Interjections.]
To this day he has not yet been publicly repudiated by that party  or  their
leadership. This is from a party that portrays itself as  liberal,  yet  the
same party continues to execute a deliberate agenda of  racial  intolerance.
Maybe this is a case where the leadership of  that  party  practises  silent
diplomacy on ``swart gevaar'' among their own ranks. [Laughter.]

There are many leaders in this country, from all communities, who are  doing
the opposite of what that letter writer and his party are  doing.  They  are
reaching out, listening to other communities, convincing  people  to  share,
giving reassurances and demonstrating how far  we  have  come  in  just  ten
years.

This takes a commitment beyond simple superficial  words  and  it  was  this
same difficulty that was expressed in the 1960s already  by  the  well-known
Afrikaans poet and philosopher Uys Krige, in one of his lesser-known  works,
``Vishoring'':


  Daarom moet ons in vrede leef,
  wit, bruin en swart en kind en kraai,
  moet ons mekaar verdra, verstaan,
  ja, hiersô aai en daarsô paai ...
  Ek weet dis swaar, verbrands,
  maar ons moet traai
  om te probeer
  en traai ... en traai ... en traai ...

Hierdie verbintenis word vergestalt in die  sigbare  vordering  in  so  baie
dele van die Suid-Afrikaanse lewe. Vir die eerste keer is daar  nou  eenheid
in die sakesektor met die samekoms van Nafcoc, die Chamber, die AU  en  dies
meer - 'n  eenheid  wat  vir  eens  en  vir  altyd  wegdoen  met  die  valse
onderskeid  tussen  swart  en  wit  sakebelange.  Op   godsdiensgebied   het
kerkeenheid in die afgelope weke alleen weer eens belowende  tekens  getoon.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This commitment is embodied in the visible progress in  so  many  areas  of
South African life. For the first time there is unity now  in  the  business
sector with the amalgamation of Nafcoc, the Chamber, the AU and  suchlike  -
a unity that does away with the false distinction between  black  and  white
business interests once and for all. In the sphere of religion church  unity
has once again displayed promising signs in recent weeks alone.]

Where we have not done as well as we could and should have, is in  the  area
of land reform. Minister Thoko Didiza is a very able Minister  and  has  the
right approach, but even she has to operate within the limits  of  available
finances.  We  may  well  be  expecting  from  the   Minister   the   almost
unachievable with the instruments she has been given to  perform  this  job.
Given current budget projections it seems unlikely that we will  reach  even
one third of our target to transfer 30% of commercial agricultural  land  to
emerging farmers by the year 2015.

Mr President, to illustrate  the  importance  Government  attaches  to  this
issue, we request that you, as President, call for a  national  land  summit
to be convened in the early  part  of  2004.  Such  a  summit  should  bring
together the most important role-players and  stakeholders  in  the  economy
such as, inter alia, existing organised agriculture,  unions  such  as  NAFU
and Ubuntu, emerging farmers, farmworkers, all three spheres  of  government
and, very importantly, the financial institutions, the  Land  Bank  and  our
agricultural support and advisory services.

The aim must be to find national consensus on how we will  achieve  the  30%
target or how close we can come; how we will address the  need  for  greater
community goodwill towards this process; how better  management  and  better
skills transfer and sharing will be achieved; how  water  rights  and  other
critical issues will be approached and, most importantly,  how  each  sector
and each stakeholder can contribute to the success  of  South  African  land
reform. To avoid such a summit simply becoming  another  forum  for  stating
differences between  stakeholders  and  to  apportion  blame,  comprehensive
preparation by all stakeholders will be necessary.

What we must avoid is what happens  too  often  with  well-intentioned  land
reform here in our own country  which,  instead  of  creating  more  wealth,
sometimes creates poverty traps when people  are  simply  dumped  onto  land
without the necessary support services and the development of skills.

In 1993 our rural economy was  in  many  ways  similar  to  that  of  feudal
Europe, with a few landowners and a  multitude  of  landless  workers  whose
lives and livelihoods depended on the goodwill of the  farmers.  Protection,
shelter and food were approached in most cases as privileges, not rights.

By 2003 we have largely pushed back the Dark Ages with great  progress  made
in terms of farmers and farmworkers working together  to  build  agriculture
and our rural communities. In the Western Cape we are particularly proud  of
the  improved  relationships  in  almost,  but  not  all,  of  our   farming
communities. There are however, throughout  the  country,  too  many  feudal
elements that remain. We must continue to work to put the  relationships  on
our farms on a footing of mutual respect and partnership.

In conclusion, in 2003 we must recall how far we have come in  the  building
of real reconciliation. Strife has been replaced by stability,  division  by
democracy, and pessimism by patriotism.

There  is  cause  for  celebrations  of  these  last  10  years,   but   our
celebrations must also be a firm  acknowledgement  of  the  challenges  that
remain for us to face in the next 10 and 20 years. They are challenges  best
faced in partnership,  building  our  common  future  together.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE FREE STATE (Miss I W  Direko):  Hon  Chairperson  of  the
NCOP, Deputy Chairperson, hon President of the  Republic  of  South  Africa,
hon members of the NCOP, premiers of the provinces of the Republic of  South
Africa and all  distinguished  members  present  here  this  afternoon,  the
remarks by the Chairperson regarding the choice of  delegates  to  the  NCOP
are appropriate. Having served in the NCOP myself, I  can  confidently  say,
in support of the Chairperson of  the  NCOP,  that  the  limited  number  of
delegates to the NCOP and the monumental load of work do  impact  negatively
on the NCOP's performance. It is therefore absolutely imperative that  those
deployed to the NCOP from the provinces should really be the cream of  those
respective provinces.

Today we stand on the threshold of a very important era of  democratic  rule
in this country. Central to  this  period  is  the  evident  shift  by  this
Government away from the practice of serving the  privileged  minority.  Our
services are now targeted not only at the majority, but,  most  importantly,
at the poorest of the poor in our land.

 This, however, was never going to be an  easy  journey,  as  we  knew.  The
higher test of this maiden decade of our democracy remains  how  we  broaden
access to a better life for all our people. It is for this reason  that  the
past nine years have always been characterised by tensions.

These tensions are naturally between those who  want  to  preserve  the  old
order and those who are determined to transform that old order.  There  were
justified expectations by the poor masses of getting a better deal from  the
new Government on the one hand, and, of course,  the  critical  shortage  of
resources on the other hand. There was also an obvious distrust of  the  new
dispensation by the rich, predominantly white, communities,  which  distrust
manifested itself in the immigration of financial and human  resources  from
this country to foreign countries.
The Free State government inherited a socially  divided  and  poor  province
that  was  a  bastion  of  apartheid,  as  a  result  of   the   inequitable
distribution of services and resources based on the policies  of  the  past.
We  were  faced  with  the  challenge  of  creating  a  new  democratic  and
accountable  institution  by  integrating  the  former  Orange  Free   State
provincial administration,  parts  of  the  Bophuthatswana  homeland,  Thaba
Nchu, and the QwaQwa administration. Our challenge in  this  regard  was  to
build a credible Public Service and a united and prosperous Free State.

As part of our building blocks in this process, we called  for  a  new  Free
Stater to partner this government in making the Free State a  better  place.
The set of values for  this  new  Free  State  was  to  include  hard  work,
perseverance, excellence, ethical conduct and a commitment to  the  creation
of a better life.

Indeed, we've worked hard to achieve these  values,  and  we  are  on  track
because it is through this hard  work  and  dedication  that  an  increasing
number of  our  people  now  have  access  to  services  like  health  care,
education, social security, housing, electricity, and other things.

Today we take pride in the achievements of this  government,  made  possible
by the Public Service infrastructure that has been built, and by the  Public
Service experience gathered in the past nine years. Chief amongst these  are
the  alignment  of  the  programmes  of  different  departments   to   avoid
duplication and to ensure an integrated approach  to  service  delivery  and
value for public funds.

We have built a public management  system  that  has  directly  impacted  on
service delivery. By the admission of  our  counterparts  elsewhere  in  the
country,  our  cabinet  system,  cluster  approach   and   interdepartmental
management  system  compare  favourably  with  similar  governance   systems
elsewhere in the world.

We continue to  work  hard  towards  economic  transformation  in  order  to
improve opportunities  that  were  hitherto  not  accessible  to  previously
marginalised Free Staters. This, amongst other things,  we  do  by  exposing
them to the international arena and by  promoting  partnerships  within  the
business environment.

Our matric pass rate has improved from 45%  to  70,7%  over  the  past  nine
years. Through  our  holistic  intervention,  the  number  of  dysfunctional
schools has been reduced from 133 to only 32 over the same period.

Seventy-nine hospitals were refurbished through our hospital  revitalisation
programme in our quest to improve access to  quality  health  care  for  our
people.  Similarly,  our  clinic  building  and  upgrade   programmes   have
significantly enhanced health  infrastructure,  particularly  in  our  rural
areas because that's where the need is greatest.

Our fight against hunger and poverty is an  ongoing  one  coupled  with  our
integrated food security programme, labour-intensive programmes  and  social
security programme. While I mention social grants, I need to  indicate  that
we have insisted that our new social grant processing system  take  only  25
days. This is because there is  money  available  -  it  is  a  question  of
expediting the processing of  the  applications  of  those  people  who  are
really in need. We, as Free Staters, have more or less cleared  the  backlog
in this area.

In the Thabo Mofutsanyana district, the  presidential  nodal  area  and  the
Xhariep district, which is the  second  poorest  area  in  the  Free  State,
30 000  households  are  being  targeted  for  food  parcels  for  now,  not
sustainably, but as  an  interim  measure  which  is  absolutely  cardinally
important. Today we have more than 460 000 beneficiaries who receive  social
grants, compared to 180 000 in 1997. This includes  240 000  children  under
the age of nine, and our uptake for  social  security  grants  as  our  main
strategy to alleviate poverty grows by 10 000 people per month.

Many of our people now own their own houses for  the  first  time  in  their
lives. Our housing programme has delivered 91 496 houses in the province  in
the past nine years. We intend to accelerate the pace because housing  gives
back the human dignity of our people living in shacks.

The rehabilitation and maintenance of 48 000 km of the road network  in  the
province has been done at a cost of R4,5 billion. Through this programme  we
were able to create more than 90 000 jobs. Some of these  people  had  never
worked before.

After the cash flow crisis of 1997-98, the Free State provincial  government
introduced  tight  fiscal  discipline  underpinned  by   prudent   financial
management. Today about 90% of our creditors are paid  through  direct  bank
deposits, minimising fraud and benefiting mostly small  businesses.  From  a
hopeless  situation  in  which  interest  charges  were  R5,9  million,  the
province is now able to budget for reserves  to  address  natural  disasters
and macroeconomic adjustments to avoid a negative impact on  the  provincial
budget.

Our quest for enhanced skills profiling in this region is evidenced  by  the
establishment of the Free State Training  and  Development  Institute.  This
institute is not only intended to improve the skills of  the  60 000  public
servants in the province, but to serve as a pivot  around  which  our  human
resources  strategy  will  revolve.  Among  other  things,  this   institute
provides financial and project management, and  customer  care  skills.  The
Free State Training and Development Institute will make a huge  contribution
to Nepad by offering training  to  public  servants  from  our  neighbouring
countries in this region.  In  fact,  a  formal  request  has  already  been
presented to the province from Angola. We hope that other provinces  in  the
country will utilise this facility while they try to get on their feet.

Our land reform programme is way ahead of schedule, with more  than  150 000
hectares having been handed over to  about  23 000  beneficiaries.  This  is
about 9% of the population of the Free State.

The Mangaung Cultural Festival, popularly referred to  as  Macufe,  is  fast
gaining the status of the biggest cultural tourism  event  in  the  Southern
hemisphere, after attracting 130 000 people in September 2003.

These achievements, and others not mentioned here, have been  made  possible
owing largely to a deep commitment to improving the way  government  engages
its stakeholders and the community in policy  and  decision-making  so  that
the knowledge, wisdom and  practical  experience  of  the  community  sector
contribute fully to policy decisions and service delivery.

Co-operative  governance  remains  the  cornerstone  of   the   Free   State
provincial government. The following milestones have been achieved  in  this
regard:  the  premier's  mayors  forum  to  ensure  the  implementation   of
integrated  development  planning;  the  Provloc  Forum  that  serves  as  a
platform  for   consultation   between   the   provincial   government   and
municipalities; and Mecloga, in which the MEC of local government  discusses
day-to-day management issues  with  municipalities  and  plans  intervention
strategies.

At this stage I wish to make a brief reference to voter registration in  the
Free State. Our sense is that the past weekend was a success,  albeit  based
on provisional figures.  The  Free  State  has  about  1,7 million  eligible
voters with 1,1 million people on the voters'  roll.  About  600 000  people
have not registered. In the Free State 256 000 people came to  register,  or
reregister, and  281 000  people  visited  voting  stations  just  to  check
whether their names were on the voters' roll. We therefore believe  that  in
the Free State we are on track.

Despite what cynics and detractors may have to  say,  our  people  know  and
have experienced a better life in the past  nine  years  of  our  democratic
rule. However, we have  to  continue  with  the  offensive  against  hunger,
poverty, disease and ignorance. There is no better  time  to  celebrate  the
gains of democracy than now. Indeed the tide has turned. The Free State  has
never been better. I thank you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF THE NORTH WEST (Dr P S Molefe): Madam  Chair,  I  am  another
neighbour of Gauteng ... [Laughter] ...  so  I  expect  the  same  lenience.
[Laughter.]

Chairperson, hon President, hon members, this gathering is taking  place  at
a time when the people across the length and  breadth  of  our  country  are
preparing to celebrate the  first  decade  of  freedom.  These  celebrations
clearly would mark another political watershed in the unfolding  process  of
transformation in our country. They will mark 10 years  of  the  triumph  of
progress over stagnation, of unity  over  division  and  of  stability  over
instability.

We, gathered here, are also therefore called upon to use this  gathering  to
celebrate the achievements of the nine and a half years of our  freedom,  as
we march towards the tenth anniversary of our liberation. We must  use  this
gathering to reflect on the challenges we face as  we  advance  towards  the
second decade of freedom.

As we cast our glance at the road we have travelled since 1994, we  see  the
massive progress we have made in the ongoing effort  to  build  ourselves  a
better country. We see growing evidence that the  quality  of  life  of  our
people is changing  for  the  better.  We  are  humbled  by  the  fact  that
increasingly our people are taking an active part in the reconstruction  and
development of our country. We are inspired by the work of  our  people,  in
partnership with Government, to address challenges  such  as  crime,  hunger
and disease.

In our province of the North West  we  are  proud  of  the  rural  women  of
Kgalagadi, Mmotla, Makgabetlwane and other areas, who are  working  hard  to
make a difference in their lives and in the lives of their  communities.  As
opposed to waiting for Government to do things for them, they have opted  to
be their own  liberators  and  are  seizing  opportunities  created  by  our
democracy.

All this, Mr President, is in response to the call you made earlier  in  the
year for partnership between Government and the people, and  on  our  people
to Vukuzenzele! So our people have responded to  that  call.  In  the  North
West we count amongst our successes the fact that  we  were  able  to  merge
three  disparate   administrations,   characterised   by   duplication   and
maladministration, into one coherent administration that upholds the  values
of Batho Pele.

We pride ourselves on our  track  record  of  good  governance  and  dealing
decisively with corruption. We have also succeeded in uprooting the  scourge
of racism in our schools, on our farms and  in  our  communities.  Ours  has
become a province where racial harmony reigns supreme. Only a few days  ago,
there was a good report by the SA  Broadcasting  Corporation  on  the  unity
that is emerging in the small town of Vryburg and  that  made  headlines  on
CNN and all other known international media of note.

That in itself suggests that, one, indeed we have moved rapidly  forward  in
consolidating this new nation that we are building and  that  reconciliation
is succeeding; and two, that our people have  listened  and  understood  the
message that identified the  challenges  of  working  together  as  critical
building blocks for the building of this new nation.

We are impressed by the progress we are making in upgrading access to  basic
services such as electricity, water and housing. Between 1994 and  1996,  we
completed over 497 000 new electricity connections.  And  between  1996  and
2000, the proportion of houses with  electricity  increased  massively  from
42% to 74%. Close to 60% of rural households in our province have access  to
electricity.

With regard to the provision of water, we are proud that in the period  from
June 1994 to 2001 the number of households with piped water inside the  yard
increased from 145 000 to 320 000. During the same period, households  whose
source of water  supply  was  dams,  rivers  and  rainwater  tanks  declined
significantly.

It is also a matter of pride that in just five years of  democracy  we  were
able to build over 50 000 houses  and  approved  housing  subsidies  to  the
value of R1,7 billion. Between 1994 and 2001 the total number of  households
under construction was 97 000, and 125 000 housing subsidies were issued.

As I am talking now, with  regard  to  the  land  redistribution  programme,
based on the land restitution process, at least 92% of  all  the  claims  in
the North West province have been settled. So we are left with 8%, which  we
believe we will reach within the target set for the end of December 2005.

We are also following the call made by the President  at  the  beginning  of
the year to intensify the registration  of  those  who  qualify  for  social
grants. We have been able to register no fewer than  92  000  between  April
and September this year. I agree with Premier  Shilowa  and  other  speakers
that, quite clearly, as these numbers increase, they  put  major  stress  on
the limited resources that we have. They do not represent  the  solution  to
the  problem;  it  is  a  short-term  measure  that  must  be  addressed  by
sustainable economic growth, the  basis  of  which  must  be  infrastructure
development,  SMME  development  and  the  acceleration  of  black  economic
empowerment.

So these are the challenges that we would need to deal with  very  seriously
in the coming period. Hon members, these challenges clearly  convince  me  -
and I am sure all  of  us  -  that  we  have  laid  a  firm  basis,  a  firm
foundation, to sustain our offensive against the legacy of  colonialism  and
apartheid. They convince  us  that  indeed  the  future  continues  to  look
qualitatively better than the past.  We  will  therefore  enter  the  second
decade of freedom confident that, acting together,  there  is  no  challenge
that we cannot overcome.

We are comforted by the knowledge that our forward march to  a  better  life
for all has gathered sufficient momentum to allow us to confront the  future
challenges with even greater vigour and determination. Acting together  with
all  stakeholders,  we  are  determined  to  continue  finding   appropriate
responses   to   the   key   challenges   of   unemployment,   poverty   and
underdevelopment. We will not tire until the  benefits  of  our  hard-earned
freedom are felt in every corner of our country.

Indeed, we will not yield until we have redeemed the pledge we made  to  our
people, and that is the pledge to build together with  them  a  better  life
for our country. A critical part of sustaining the  momentum  that  we  have
begun  building  is  to  ensure  that  we  strengthen  the  institutions  of
intergovernmental relations and co-operative governance.  It  is  only  when
this is effective that we will  be  able  to  ensure  better  co-ordination,
better co-operation, and ensure that there is mutual capacity that we  build
as a result of this co-operation. As a consequence of that,  we  would  then
be able to enhance the quality and quantity of services we  deliver  to  our
people.

In this regard, we must therefore continue to strengthen the system  of  our
intergovernmental  relations  and  our  intergovernmental  structures.   The
impressive progress made in the Kgalakgadi development node, now  designated
as a Nepad pilot project, is a direct result of this co-operation that I  am
talking about, and we must continue to  consolidate  that  co-operation.  We
must take the lessons we have learned in co-operative governance with us  as
we continue confronting the challenges that lie ahead and as we continue  to
prepare for the next 10 years of democracy. I thank  you,  hon  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

The PREMIER OF  THE  EASTERN  CAPE  (Rev  M  A  Stofile):  Chairperson,  hon
Premiers, President of our country, colleagues, before  1994  when  we  were
fighting for the liberation of this country we were always  aware  that  the
biggest challenge was not going to  be  the  defeat  of  apartheid  but  the
reconstruction of our country and the establishment of a democratic order.

From 1994 until now, our country has been blessed with leadership  of  great
calibre, from Madiba to you, Mr President - not only our  country,  but  our
continent and the rest of the world. We have  enjoyed  your  leadership  and
you have given us the kind of courage that we need at this juncture  of  our
struggle. You inspire us and you make us very proud.

The Sunday before last, at the church established by Van Der Kemp 200  years
ago, Rev Jakes Albert and his congregation prayed  for  you,  your  strength
and, indeed, for clarity as you  continue  to  guide  us.  On  Saturday,  at
Ikhwezi Lokusa in Umtata, Pastor Sithole and his church prayed for  you  and
your Government. On Sunday, at Duncanville, Bishop Siwa, preaching  in  that
function, called upon the  whole  Methodist  Church  to  pray  for  you,  Mr
President, and the leadership of this country.

 This is because of what our people believe to be a  special  blessing,  not
just to South Africa but to our generation, to have the kind  of  leadership
that will be able to lead us in the right direction  and  also  to  identify
the kind of direction on  our  behalf,  because  a  leadership  that  simply
reflects its followers is not of any real advantage  to  those  that  follow
it.

For this reason, Mr President,  the  daunting  challenges  of  dealing  with
transformation and the legacy of our past do not scare us  at  all.  We  are
resolved to succeed in building the  South  Africa  of  the  dreams  of  our
forebears and, indeed, of our own generation. The ups  and  downs  of  these
programmes were anticipated and they cannot scare us away.

Scientific and professional institutions, independent  and  informed  bodies
show that the Eastern Cape province has not been left behind in the  changes
that took place between 1994 and 2003. We have made a mark, Comrade  Dipico.
They say that today is different from those years. Statistics  South  Africa
2001,   the   South   African   independent   government    auditors,    the
Intergovernmental Review and a whole lot of other reports continue  to  show
that in some areas we are performing a little better than the  average.  The
Public service which was composed of  five  different  administrations  from
the past homelands has now been united into one motivated Public Service.

I am not saying that it is free of corruption, but I am simply  saying  that
it is, nevertheless, a motivated Public Service which has left  the  squalor
of demotivation and hanging of jackets on chairs when they should  be  doing
service to our communities.

The Auditor-General indicated in 1996 that we had an overdraft of almost  R3
billion, and the central  Government  swiftly  moved  in  to  assist  us  by
imposing section 100 in 1997. We are proud, Mr President and colleagues,  to
say that our financial management ability  has  been  spoken  about  in  the
National Assembly and in this House. It is one of the best in this  country,
there is no question about it. With regard to  the  departments  that  could
not get proper reports from the Auditor-General previously,  at  least  some
of them have now received  100%  clean  slates  -  even  the  department  of
health, Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, got a clean slate for being  able
to perform properly in terms of managing our resources.

Human resource  development  has  also  integrated  those  citizens  of  our
province who are not necessarily employed by Government, the unemployed  and
those people who have no skills whatsoever. We are proud about what we  have
achieved to date. Economic growth is characterised by above national  growth
levels in terms of the automotive sector  and  agriculture.  These,  indeed,
contribute to our fight against poverty and starvation.

The schools, clinics and road constructions are some of  the  sectors  where
we are right at the top, and second to none in building and construction  in
this country. In housing, the report shows that we are second to  KZN  only.
We are not satisfied with that. We  think  more  houses  still  need  to  be
built.

More children than ever before benefit from the child support grant  as  you
called for, Mr President,  on  12  January  this  year.  More  children  are
benefiting from the primary school nutrition programme. Again, there lies  a
problem, as my colleagues have said.

As we become more efficient in the management of these things, the  more  we
are exposed to more financial pressures. We have now discovered that  it  is
our fault - we are not blaming anybody for this - and it  is  the  fault  of
our inefficiency in the past and, indeed, of our efficiency in  the  present
that we now realise that, in the PSNP, we have been receiving a  conditional
grant for grade R to four when policy says we should be funded for  grade  R
to seven. So, we have been  receiving  50%  of  what  we  should  have  been
receiving. We are not complaining, but we are saying that we  get  more  and
more efficient and as we do so, more pressures are exposed.

We are proud of our efforts at food production. When  we  started  our  mass
food production programme, we were producing 50 000 tons a year. I  am  very
excited to announce that this year we have produced 150 000 tons  of  grain,
and that we are almost at our stated objective of producing 300 000 tons  of
grain by 2005.

I was travelling with Chief Matanzima  last  night  and  he  said  that  his
subjects are complaining that they now don't  have  enough  rooms  to  store
their grain. There is more food than there is space to store it;  be  it  in
Cofimvaba or eNgqushwa -  pineapples,  chicory,  maize  or  sweet  potatoes,
pumpkins or potatoes - our people are beginning to have more than they  have
ever had before. And we are not satisfied. We still  say  we  must  do  some
more.

Traditional and religious leaders,  women's  groups,  youth  formations  and
people with disabilities are all participating in these  initiatives.  As  a
result, we are confident that this is the sort  of  sustainable  development
that will not only solve our  food  problems,  but  will  also  relieve  our
cities of the ever-growing squatter camps. Because these, Mr President,  are
people who have flooded the cities in the hope  of  getting  a  better  life
there. If we improve their lives from where they come, I have  no  doubt  in
my mind that we shall be able to call them back to where they belong.

I was watching the group  of  people  who  call  themselves  ``the  landless
people''. The young lady who was announced had a surname that  either  comes
from Butterworth or Idutywa - and she is too young to be landless anyway.  I
think she left her home, the land that belongs to  her  family  because  she
thought that there was hope of getting land and a better life  in  Eikenhof.
All I am saying is that this food production  and  agricultural  performance
is, no doubt, going to assist us relieve the problems of our  colleagues  as
well.

One of the oldest schools  in  Port  Elizabeth,  Patterson  High  School  in
Korsten, has started a soup kitchen programme this week to feed  their  poor
community members. I was there on Tuesday, and they told me  that  this  was
because they were inspired by the way in which our Government  has  made  it
possible for all sectors to participate in these programmes.  Those  schools
that have gardens are now coming forward, they want to feed their  children.
Those schools that have people who can produce from their  own  neighbouring
gardens are coming forward to say that they also want to contribute  towards
a better future.

Nepad is at work in our  endeavours  to  resuscitate  the  Majola-Magwa  tea
estates. Both Ferrostaal and a group of businesspeople from Uganda have  met
with us twice. The next meeting is on Wednesday in Port  Elizabeth  to  look
at how to put together a  joint  partnership  with  the  trustees  of  those
skills and improve the productive and marketing capacity of  those  estates,
because they produce good tea, but they are  just  being  stifled  by  their
competitors.

Mr President, I am not saying that the picture is all roses in  the  Eastern
Cape. The road is still long. But we are  willing  and  ready  to  walk  it,
because we have great leaders like you. We can, as long as we  are  afforded
an opportunity to do what we think should be done.

Last but not least, we want to assure the NCOP - I cannot  assure  the  NCOP
for the Eastern Cape - on behalf of the ANC in the  Eastern  Cape  that  the
delegates that we send here are some of the best  cadres  that  we  have  in
that province. [Applause.]

Unfortunately we cannot dictate to the other parties who to send  here.  But
for our part we pledge, as we have done in the past, that we  will  continue
to send our best cadres here. We have  already  identified  the  people  who
must come here in the next term, because we want this body  to  succeed.  We
want our voices to be expressed in no uncertain terms. We want our  will  to
be carried equally to everybody's will.

Madam Chairperson, congratulations on the good work done  so  far,  I  think
your leadership has been outstanding and we  shall  be  right  there  behind
you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF KWAZULU-NATAL (Dr L P H  M  Mtshali):  Chairperson,  I  stand
before you as the premier of our most populous province.  KwaZulu-Natal  has
been the province most infected and affected by the  HIV/Aids  pandemic  and
has one of the highest rates of unemployment.
However, KwaZulu-Natal is providing innovative and imaginative solutions  to
its problems, and it is moving by leaps and bounds towards a better  future.
Part of the success of KwaZulu-Natal lies in the uniqueness  of  its  people
and  the  political  system  which  they  have  chosen  to   express   their
governance. Our political system is the expression  of  the  willingness  of
our province to take charge of its destiny and deal with  its  problems  the
best it can, through the autonomy of its government.

When I spoke in this debate last year, I expressed the concern that I  might
not have been able to speak to you in my capacity as premier because of  the
effects of the floor-crossing legislation. At the time, my  premiership  was
being undermined, not because of the will of  my  province  but  because  of
amendments that this Parliament intended to make to our  Constitution.  Some
such amendments would have operated with retrospective effect to bring  back
into the legislature of my  province  members  who  were  expelled  from  it
because of their  crossing  the  floor  under  unconstitutional  legislation
passed by this Parliament, in spite of our objection.
The retrospective amendment had the purpose,  not  of  taking  KwaZulu-Natal
through an election,  but  of  tampering  with  the  Constitution,  and  was
defeated  by  the  willingness  of  our  province  to  resort  to  an  early
provincial election. By resorting to  an  early  election,  we  intended  to
juxtapose the mandate of the people to the mischievous will  of  politicians
to ensure that the will of the people could remain supreme.

When the constitutional amendment was passed by this House  without  such  a
retrospective provision, the crossing of the floor altered the will  of  the
people and another attempt was made to  oust  the  IFP  premiership.  Months
later, it is clear that such a shift of power was the result  of  expediency
on the side of the individuals concerned and of promises  made  to  them  by
the majority party. It did not reflect fundamental issues of policy  or  the
interests of the people of my province.

However, again, the democratic system of  KwaZulu-Natal  defeated  political
expediency and undemocratic tendencies unleashed by the laws passed by  this
Parliament. KwaZulu-Natal proved again to be the  most  vital  democracy  in
South Africa. Political forces reorganised themselves not just to  solve  an
immediate problem, but to forge a better future in  the  interest  of  South
Africa. The partnership of like-minded parties which was  formed  last  year
between the IFP and the DA  maintained  the  premiership  there,  where  the
electorate placed it. [Interjections.]

KwaZulu-Natal's  democracy  moved  forward  to  create  the  basis   for   a
democratic alternative, which has now brought new hope for all  the  genuine
democrats. As I stand before you, I'm conscious that my premiership  is  the
expression of this process and the modest hopes of our democracy. Today  I'm
the only premier who  is  not  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  the
majority party and who presides  over  the  only  government  which  is  not
beholden to the majority party.  [Interjections.]  With  KwaZulu-Natal  lies
the hope of a vibrant democracy for the whole of South Africa.  And  we  are
committed to extending this hope to ensure  that  the  regular  dynamics  of
democracy may one day become a reality in all provinces in this Parliament.

This past weekend the President campaigned in KwaZulu-Natal  and  called  on
the people to elect a new premier in April. [Interjections.]  One  needs  to
ask oneself what that would do  to  our  democracy.  Perhaps  the  President
would prefer a premier  who  would  not  question  in  this  venue  why  the
agreement with the global fund to receive international assistance  for  the
treatment of HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis has not yet been  signed  in
spite of the plight of millions. Perhaps some people  would  prefer  silence
from the only voice today which is questioning why Cabinet cannot  find  the
time to receive and process the report on  the  roll-out  of  antiretroviral
drugs, which was due by last September - as if this matter  was  not  urgent
in spite of our people dying in their thousands.

It may also be convenient to silence the voice which questions why the  IFP-
ANC coalition  in  KwaZulu-Natal  has  collapsed.  I  must  set  the  record
straight on how much we did to  make  the  IFP-ANC  coalition  work  and  to
promote reconciliation. The IFP believed in its partnership with the ANC  at
all levels. While the partnership  worked  better  at  the  national  level,
KwaZulu-Natal  has  been  the  venue  where  this  partnership  proved   its
shortcomings and inimical effect  towards  the  long-term  interest  of  our
democracy.

Ten years ago it was formally agreed  that  the  monarchy  of  KwaZulu-Natal
would be recognised and accommodated within the parameters of the new  South
Africa. This was one of the items that the IFP-ANC  KwaZulu-Natal  coalition
was duty-bound to deliver on. Yet, after 10 years,  nothing  has  been  done
for our monarchy, and the  record  of  history  shows  a  stream  of  broken
promises and switched positions. The latest of these was  the  KwaZulu-Natal
Royal High Commission Bill, which was meant to strengthen our  monarchy  and
was duly approved by the Cabinet, but was then stopped by  the  ANC  leaders
during the parliamentary process.

This matter affects the majority of the people of our province who wish  the
monarchy to be recognised. It shows how the  ANC  in  KwaZulu-Natal  is  not
pursuing the agenda of meeting the wishes of our province  but  rather  that
of serving what is wanted, wished and decided nationally. There is no  doubt
that if the IFP didn't  hold  the  premiership,  the  entire  issue  of  the
monarchy would be dropped together with any KwaZulu-Natal  perspective  when
dealing with KwaZulu-Natal issues and situations. I hope that one  day  such
a provincial perspective may inspire the work of all  premierships,  thereby
fulfilling the constitutional vision.

In KwaZulu-Natal, we unanimously approved a constitution  for  the  province
at a provincial level but when the issue was conceded by the  national  ANC,
the provincial constitution was rejected and its certification opposed  even
though it contained compromises  which  would  have  accommodated  everyone,
including cultural councils important for the IFP and the NP; provisions  on
the monarchy accepted by  everyone;  and  a  number  of  features  aimed  at
ensuring better and more effective governance  in  our  province.  Also,  on
that occasion,  a  national  perspective  obliterated  a  provincial  vision
crafted over two years of negotiation.

Our  democracy  needs  the  type  of  pluralism  which  the  perspective  of
provincial autonomy can contribute. Without it  our  democracy  will  wither
away and issues such as the monarchy of KwaZulu-Natal, which  are  important
to the people, will be neglected merely because they are  not  important  to
the rulers. Issues such as the war on HIV/Aids would have no champions in  a
venue such as this, in spite of millions  suffering  from  HIV/Aids,  merely
because everyone else feels compelled not to  challenge  what  is  obviously
utterly wrong.

I've been brought up in a culture of respect but  I  have  learnt  that  the
most important measure of respect should not be for those who are above  us,
but for those who depend on us and  have  placed  their  trust  in  us.  The
people of my province trust me to come to this venue and ask: Where are  the
antiretroviral drugs which would have been  made  available  to  them  years
ago? And, why has Government not yet fully complied with the  order  of  the
Constitutional Court to make nevirapine available to all mothers to  prevent
the transmission of HIV/Aids to their newborn babies?

The people of my province trust me to  raise  the  issue  and  question  why
Government has failed to generate employment as if this  was  never  one  of
its real priorities, and why it has neglected  to  take  the  many  measures
which are available to  curb  crime  and  corruption.  [Interjections.]  The
people of my province also want to know why poverty  alleviation  programmes
are not working;  and  why  Government  has  not  prioritised  measures  for
fighting poverty in rural areas.

Our democracy is about raising the issues  of  this  time  clearly,  without
fear or prejudice, and openly discussing them in a debate  of  this  nature.
Without this difference of views, this debate  would  be  a  single-tonality
chorus singing a requiem for the  many  hopes  for  freedom,  democracy  and
pluralism which arose at the dawn of our new Republic almost 10  years  ago.
I thank you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER  OF  THE  NORTHERN  CAPE  (Mr  E  M  Dipico):  Chairperson,  hon
President, members of the House, colleagues, we have come a long  way  since
the  democratic  breakthrough  in  April  1994.  We  have  listened  to  our
colleagues demonstrate that we have come a long way.

What my hon colleague Premier Mtshali has just demonstrated to  us  is  that
we still have a long way to go. [Laughter.] What a long way to  go!  When  I
was appointed as  the  premier  of  the  province,  people  started  to  ask
questions about delivery or about their pension  not  being  paid  on  time,
about school teachers not being there, about  nurses  who  are  not  in  the
wards where the patients are, and about  children  passing  matric  and  not
getting jobs. I can't blame God. I can't blame somebody else.  I  must  take
full responsibility. The buck stops in my office. In the  Northern  Cape  we
speak Afrikaans and we say: ``'n Man maak 'n plan.'' [A man makes a plan.]

We have to go out and solve those problems. That is  why  we  are  premiers.
That's why we have powers vested in us in  terms  of  the  Constitution.  We
have a responsibility as leaders to answer the people who  trust  in  us  by
saying: ``Ek gaan 'n plan maak.'' [I am going to make a plan.]

You have to create the jobs. You have to get the drug. You have  to  go  out
and find a drug, even if it is a Disprin. Go and find a drug, that  is  your
responsibility. I am only disturbed when we sit here as  the  leadership  of
this country, nine years down the line, and  this  language  comes  in  this
fashion, that we have to go and account to the  people,  that  we  pass  the
buck.

We enjoy the privileges as premiers -  driving  up  and  down  and  all  the
niceties - but when we are asked pertinent  questions  we  talk  in  general
about the majority party. [Applause.] For example, we are asked very  simple
questions like: ``Why don't we have jobs?'' But when good things  do  happen
to us - when the President signs a certificate to give me land as a  premier
- I don't say: ``Thank you, President.'' When my hon colleague accepted  his
title deed the other day, getting land for himself and his family,  not  for
the people of KZN, he did not thank the President. It is  important  for  us
to be honest and sincere as people who have grown up in this country.

Thank you very much. I have met people who are older than me before. When  I
was at the University of Fort Hare, I met hon Premier  Stofile,  driving  up
and down to Grahamstown in his car. He stopped for me, and he told  me  that
even if things were bad, I had to tell the truth. It is now  the  time  that
we must learn to tell the truth. Go and tell people  that  you  have  failed
them. You can't be premier for life. The time has come. [Applause.]

The President of South Africa must have a scorecard for all of  us,  because
we perform these duties on his behalf. When we don't  perform,  he  can  see
the graph going down. Yes, we say the people must  speak.  The  people  will
speak next year. They have to speak. If we have to account to  them  we  say
other things.

But, Mr President, there are good things happening in our  country.  We  are
proud, as a province, that we have managed to make a contribution, small  as
it is, in the Northern Cape to transform the lives of  our  people.  We  can
say we have travelled a journey. Today the Northern Cape  has  an  identity.
We had no infrastructure and no administration. We  were  part  of  the  old
Cape Provincial Administration consisting of the Northern Cape, the  Eastern
Cape and the Western Cape. We were unknown. No one gave us a chance that  we
would succeed. It was a  challenge  to  unite  the  people  of  the  biggest
province. Its land consists of 30% of this country. We  had  to  travel  and
bring the Nama, the San, the Koran  and  the  Griqua  people  in.  Everybody
today has a  sense  of  belonging  that  they  are  ``Noord-Kaap  mense''  -
Northern Cape people. That is good for us. It is good for democracy.

When I started on that fateful day, that first day as a premier,  there  was
no place to get a cheque. There was no place even to get  a  spoon  to  make
tea. We could not call the President of South Africa to get a spoon for  us.
That time the office of  the  Cape  Provincial  Administration  was  in  the
Western Cape. The premier then was Premier Kriel, the former premier of  the
Western Cape. I called him and said that the budget was  in  Cape  Town  and
asked  him  to  send  us  money  to  buy  teaspoons.  He  said:   ``Send   a
requisition.'' [Laughter.] That is what he told me. Send a requisition,  and
I complied and sent one. He bought the  teaspoons  here  and  sent  them  by
courier to the Northern Cape. [Laughter.]

I said that there were no toilet rolls. He  said:  ``Send  a  requisition.''
[Laughter.] He bought them here and sent them there. I  had  to  travel  and
come and fight. Strong language had to be used in Afrikaans. As I was  still
busy with him, trying to resolve the problems of the division of  assets  of
the Eastern Cape, and so on ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Premier,  could  you  please  wrap
up?

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): Look at the  time,  it  is
12 minutes. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! There  is  a  problem  with  my
stopwatch, but the Secretary has corrected it. Could you please continue?

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E  M  Dipico):  Chairperson,  how  much
time do I have?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please continue.

The PREMIER OF THE NORTHERN CAPE (Mr E M Dipico): Chairperson, I  was  still
trying to get a record of those  assets  when  we  were  informed  that  the
premier was no longer Kriel; it was Morkel. We came back to  negotiate,  and
he constituted a task team. When I came back, he was  no  longer  there.  It
was another premier, Premier Marais. I met him two weeks ago and I  said  to
him: ``What happened, Premier?'' He said:  ``My  premiership  was  stolen.''
[Laughter.] I cannot understand him. But today I am  proud,  hon  President,
that the issue of the  assets  has  been  resolved.  Thank  you  very  much,
Premier Van Schalkwyk. Thank you very much for your leadership.

Today we are also proud that the Nepad  spirit  is  alive  in  the  Northern
Cape. Together with Namibia we have a joint team working  towards  utilising
the Orange River, and ensuring that we grow and bring  life  to  our  people
and create many jobs. Regarding the grape industry of the Northern Cape,  we
have taken the farmers into Namibia  to  grow  the  grapes,  also  in  other
parts. As you know, in the old South Africa that  whole  river  belonged  to
South Africa. In this new democracy we had to halve that  border  to  ensure
that the border runs in the middle of that  river.  Then  we  could  develop
that growth. That is going very well according to a report.

The Mier and Kgalagadi people are very thankful to say  that  their  dignity
has been restored. As indigenous people, as Khoisan people,  they  got  back
large tracts of land  through  your  assistance,  hon  President.  They  got
ownership of the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. They got electricity  through
the Nampower initiative through which  we  draw  electricity  from  Namibia.
They got sanitation and water. Their children now  also  study  in  English.
They also study the Nama and San languages. That is very good. We  got  them
teachers. They also have a radio station brought to them by the SABC. It  is
managed by their own children who have  been  trained,  and  they  speak  to
their own people. That is the dignity we have restored to our people.

We have ensured that the flying doctor scheme will take the  specialists  to
all those faraway places. We have removed cataracts  from  the  old  people.
With the specialist there, one  ouma  woke  up  after  the  operation.  They
removed the cotton wool from her eyes and when  she  looked  for  the  first
time, she said that after eight years she could see a person. And I was  the
first person to be next to her and she said: ``Nei man, ek het nie geken  jy
is so nie.'' [No, man, I did not know you were like that.]

She was really confused. She thought I was her husband, because she had  not
seen her husband  for  eight  years.  [Laughter.]  She  said  that  God  had
performed a miracle. When I explained to her that I  was  the  premier,  she
said: ``Ek glo dit nie. Jy is 'n engel.'' You are  an  angel  sent  by  God.
This is the type of expression you hear when you go to the people  and  when
you go to iimbizo. The people express happiness for the things  we  do  when
we speak to them and govern with them.

Various projects have unfolded of  partnerships  with  the  farmers  in  the
grape industry. We even build roads together  with  the  mining  houses.  We
have been building roads and  contributing  50-50.  We  will  continue  with
this. We say to the hon President that this  is  the  time  that  we  should
unfold the extended Public Works Programmes. They have a chance to  succeed.
What  is  important  is  for  all  of  us  to   move,   as   provinces   and
municipalities, with speed. That is the implementation arm.  We  are  called
upon as leadership to rise to the occasion.

Project management is one of the key elements to make  these  projects  move
faster. We think of the private sector. We will also  speak  to  the  mining
houses to second some of the people in project  management  to  ensure  that
these projects can kickstart immediately without hiccups. These  are  issues
which we believe can make a difference.
Another suggestion, hon President, when we deal with these public works:  We
have a lot of  mines  throughout  this  country  which  are  unrehabilitated
dumps. Together with the  mining  houses  we  could  undertake  the  labour-
intensive projects of flattening those  dumps  and  making  the  environment
much friendlier. That is also a good partnership, we believe, we  can  bring
to our people.

The learnerships of the youth do deal with  one  big  problem.  Many  youths
tell us that when they finish their matric,  diploma  or  degree,  employers
immediately  ask  of  them  to  have  experience.  They  do  not  have  that
experience.  They  ask  where  they  should   get   that   experience.   The
learnerships have closed  that  gap.  It  is  important  that  education  at
institutions of higher learning should  ensure  that  there  are  programmes
that prepare children to be employable. It  is  important  that  those  very
degrees can speak to the labour market, so that it will be  able  to  absorb
these people.

We believe through this work we can only see a better South Africa  for  the
coming years. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Dr Z L MKHIZE (KwaZulu-Natal): Mhlonishwa [Chairperson], His Excellency  the
President, may I thank the President for a very inspiring address.

Of course, if any of us were to roll back time and take a glimpse  at  1993,
one year before our day of freedom and democracy, few of us would have  been
able to guess where we would be after  the  first  decade  of  freedom.  The
violence, the tension, the fear, the  uncertainty  and  instability  of  the
time simply faded away in our memories.

If South Africa were a patient then, we would have diagnosed it as having  a
very poor prognosis indeed. Fortunately, we had very good leadership and  10
years in the life of any nation is a very short space of time. But today  we
count amongst our virtues the peaceful climate, the political  and  economic
stability,  our  world-renowned  Constitution,  and  today  we   enjoy   the
confidence of political stability to an extent that  we  have  no  sleepless
nights even though the high security treason trial of  the  Boeremag  is  in
progress in Pretoria. Anyone who may suggest that there is  a  threat  of  a
coup can only be laughed at as daydreaming.

I thought that we would be dealing with issues that relate to  the  province
in a different way, but it would appear that the NCOP does not need to  come
to KwaZulu-Natal to enjoy our vibrant debate, seeing that we  are  going  to
be bringing it into this debate.

The unfortunate thing is that the premier has largely represented the  views
of the IFP component of KwaZulu-Natal, with which the ANC differs  markedly.
Firstly, the coalition government of the ANC and IFP  was  done  to  promote
service  delivery,  not  to  guarantee  or  save  any  position.   The   ANC
voluntarily withdrew the premiership candidature  of  Comrade  Sbu  Ndebele,
which Roger Burrows contested, and the IFP needed the ANC in  order  to  get
the premiership. It was our considered decision to assist  and  support  the
IFP in that regard. It was not an act of folly on our  part,  and  40%  does
not allow any party to choose a premier if it does not have 50% plus.

The law on crossing the floor was  passed  in  Parliament  and,  of  course,
whether we like it or not, it is a  democratic  law  and  there  is  nothing
immoral about it. Some parties and many did benefit from this Act.  The  ANC
is of course not an NGO. It's a political party which contests elections  in
all positions.  In  KwaZulu-Natal,  like  any  other  part,  the  ANC  is  a
democratic party and it does not  operate  on  the  basis  of  control  from
anywhere.

The basis of the deterioration  of  the  ANC-IFP  relations  actually  arose
because certain IFP leaders actually frustrated the ten-a-side  process  and
they reneged on a coalition government. The issue  of  the  constitution  of
KwaZulu-Natal was, in fact,  dismissed  in  the  Constitutional  Court.  The
court said that it was fatally flawed and that  it  had  very  exotic  ideas
which  were  not  in  keeping  with  the  Constitution   of   the   country.
Furthermore, the basic understanding of law would make  us  understand  that
that constitution would have been rejected in any case.

The second effort of the constitution failed, again as far  as  the  ANC  is
concerned, because of the IFP. Prof Khubisa, who is a  member  of  the  IFP,
was the chairperson of the committee. It actually did not operate  until  it
was disbanded three years later.

We also believe that the Royal High Commission  Bill  was  an  implementable
proposition, and the ANC passed a resolution  recommending  a  parliamentary
councillor to His Majesty to actually assist the IFP in the process  because
we had agreed  with  the  proposal  of  getting  someone  to  represent  His
Majesty. So we do not agree with most of the things that have been said.

However, KwaZulu-Natal, despite the existence of a fractious  and  sometimes
tumultuous coalition government, has  also  seen  an  advent  of  peace  and
relative  stability.  Violence,  though   not   entirely   eradicated,   has
significantly  receded  to  open  the  way  for  economic  development,  new
investment  and  a  boost  to  tourism.  There  are  challenges   to   face,
particularly the one of pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  We  are
heartened by the finalisation of the plan  to  implement  the  Public  Works
Programme. We await its implementation with eagerness.

The issue which the President spoke about,  namely  Zibambele,  is  actually
one of our areas of pride in the province.  At  the  moment,  they  estimate
that it offers  jobs  to  about  28  000  people,  and  it  really  makes  a
difference between life and death.

Service delivery has also improved. With regard to health, in  1994  we  saw
1,6 million people annually in the  clinics  and  today  we  are  seeing  18
million, and 5 000 community  health  workers  promote  health  in  villages
where there are no health facilities for tens of kilometres.  Therefore  the
provision of  water,  sanitation,  houses,  social  grants  and  so  on  has
actually reduced the impact of the burden of diseases on our people.

The severe impact of poverty, HIV/Aids and other preventable infections  can
only be reversed significantly by improving the socioeconomic status of  all
those who are in the second economy that the President  referred  to.  Those
are the ones who die of HIV/Aids, cholera, TB and malaria in  our  province,
and we are therefore grateful for all the decisions  that  the  Cabinet  has
taken,  particularly  on  the  financial  commitment  and  in  relation   to
HIV/Aids. We therefore also need to mobilise our people, in  the  spirit  of
Vukuzenzele, to actively participate in their own upliftment in  partnership
with Government.

Our real challenge, for example, on the issue of  antiretrovirals,  is  care
for patients once they leave the hospital, where the  communities  must  now
come forward as volunteers and care-givers and so on, because  that  is  the
area which has no nurses or doctors to supervise patients.  It  is  in  that
kind of spirit that our people need to understand that it's not  only  about
what the hospitals can do, but it's also about what  they  themselves  could
also be doing.
The other issue which I believe is also  important  to  raise  is  that  the
international standing of  South  Africa  has  significantly  improved.  Its
people are represented in more  countries  than  the  previous  regime  ever
imagined was possible, having become the champion  of  developing  countries
within and outside the continent. And on that basis, we believe  that  there
is an obligation on our Government to deal with this issue. We therefore  do
not understand the basis  on  which  some  of  the  opposition  leaders  are
complaining when the President and the Ministers are fulfilling this task.

I think they have actually not shifted from the  mindset  of  the  apartheid
times and they are looking at the new South Africa through the eyes  of  the
old apartheid regime, which was not wanted  anywhere  in  the  world.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

The PREMIER OF MPUMALANGA (Mr N J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  His  Excellency
the President of the country, hon premiers and members of the House, we  are
gathered here today to look back at the nine years of great achievements.

Indeed we  can  say  we  have  achieved  a  better  life  through  effective
implementation of Government programmes and the delivery  of  services  that
respond to the needs  and  expectations  of  our  people.  It  will  not  be
possible for us to measure how far we have travelled  down  the  road  of  a
better life without looking back at what we inherited  from  the  past  nine
years.

When we look back, we find that the majority of  the  people  in  Mpumalanga
were living in rural areas with no source of income.  Many  communities  had
no  basic  facilities  such  as  water  reticulation,  bulk  water   supply,
electricity, proper sanitation, roads and streets,  recreational  facilities
or housing. There was an inequitable allocation of social grants founded  on
a discriminatory practice, and based on gender and race.

In the health sector there was a lack of adequate health facilities,  health
personnel  and  basic  health  services  such  as  primary,  preventive  and
curative health  facilities.  The  majority  of  schools  were  overcrowded,
underresourced  and  had  no  proper  buildings.  This  skimpy  and   skewed
distribution of resources was also felt  on  the  farms.  Apart  from  being
exploited, farmworkers had no access  to  basic  facilities  such  as  clean
water,   schools,   health   institutions,   electricity   or   recreational
facilities.

We also inherited an economy that relied heavily on the natural  environment
with very little beneficiation of  the  natural  resources  with  which  the
province is endowed. Since 1994, our major challenge has been  to  eradicate
poverty and thus improve the lives of our people. One way to do this was  to
transform the fragmented and discriminatory social security system.  Through
careful planning,  the  number  of  social  grant  beneficiaries  has  grown
rapidly to 395 722. These include old age benefits; war  veterans'  payouts;
and disability, care, dependency and child support grants. Child  protection
is a key priority  of  the  province.  Thousands  of  children  are  reached
annually through awareness  campaigns  on  children's  rights  and  parental
responsibilities.

Great strides have been made in the provision  of  health  services  to  the
people of Mpumalanga, specifically through taking health care facilities  to
the rural poor areas of  the  province.  Secondary  and  specialised  health
services were nonexistent in 1994, but with the intergovernmental  agreement
between South Africa and Cuba,  as  well  as  the  joint  contracts  between
Mpumalanga and the University of Pretoria  and  Medunsa,  the  province  has
developed basic capacity to provide this essential service.

The  introduction  of   community   service   doctors   and   other   health
professionals in our primary health care facilities and  district  hospitals
has improved the accessibility and quality of health  care.  There  are  239
fixed primary health care facilities and 80 mobile clinics. Since  1994,  19
new clinics have been  built  and  seven  clinics  are  in  the  process  of
construction. There are now 22 district  hospitals  and  six  were  declared
baby-friendly by  the  World  Health  Organisation  and  Unicef.  Those  are
Themba, Barberton, Bethal, Witbank, Delmas and Shongwe hospitals.

The primary school feeding scheme programme, which started in 1995 when  350
000 learners were fed, has grown and now provides for 1  325  needy  schools
comprising 460 000 primary school  learners.  The  programme  also  provides
work to a number of  people.  More  than  2  200  unemployed  women  receive
honorariums per feeding day.  There  are  more  children  receiving  quality
education at well-equipped schools than there were nine years ago.  We  have
enhanced  the  provision  of  learner  support  materials,   infrastructure,
scholar transport, scholar feeding, and the general quality of teaching  and
learning.

More than 2 million people now receive  clean  water  in  the  province.  We
continue to house our people in decent houses that they can call their  own.
A total of 113 771 units were built and  transferred  since  1994  to  date.
More than 345 553 new households have been  provided  with  electricity.  We
have been able to do this and more because we are  in  constant  touch  with
the people. Since 1999, the Mpumalanga executive council  has  been  holding
fortnightly outreach programmes in different regions of  the  province.  The
executive council outreach programmes and imbizo's  were  most  enlightening
and educative. A total of 64 sessions of the outreach programmes  were  held
and a total of 512 communities visited.

Being largely a rural province, we have made great strides in improving  the
relationship between Government and traditional leaders in the province.  As
a province, we have brought services  closer  to  the  people  by  utilising
traditional authority offices for Government functions  such  as  processing
applications for old age grants, disability and  child  support  grants.  We
have also provided transport for the traditional leaders. The Department  of
Home Affairs has trained all our provincial officials whom we have  deployed
in the offices of the traditional leaders.  They  now  process  applications
for identity documents as well as birth and death registrations.

The youth in our province have not been idle. They are involved in a  number
of community-based projects which include the rehabilitation of  dilapidated
houses in Nsikazi, Nkomazi, Elukwatini, Mooiplaas and Nhlazatshe.  They  are
also involved in five  poverty  alleviation  projects  in  Mbuzini,  Leroro,
Moutse,  Moretele  and  Nhlazatshe.  Our  youth  also  participate  in   the
premier's special projects, valued at R131,978 million. To date,  up  to  12
youth companies have successfully tendered and completed work  allocated  to
them. The question of these allocations was due to lack of  water  and  road
construction in the rural areas.

When we realised the situation of the lack of skills in the fields  such  as
mathematics,  science,  technology  and  engineering,   we   initiated   the
establishment of the Premier's Bursary Fund to deal with  this  matter.  The
bursary fund was established to cater for the pupils of Mpumalanga who  have
excelled and showed strong potential in the fields of  mathematics,  science
and technology. The bursaries are awarded on merit and the  recipients  will
be carried through until they complete their  studies.  They  will  have  to
utilise their knowledge for a particular period in the province.

In order to fight  poverty  the  province  initiated  a  number  of  poverty
alleviation programmes. One of the  first  poverty  alleviation  initiatives
embarked on was to address rural poverty among  women  with  children  under
five years of age. Part of the five poverty relief programme  objectives  of
the Mpumalanga provincial government is the development  of  household  food
security  through  the  establishment  of  food   production   clusters   in
communities, with a particular focus on households affected by HIV/Aids.

We have also gone a long way in improving the economy of  the  province  and
in the process created much-needed jobs. For instance, we  have  established
petrochemical projects  as  well  as  wood  and  forestry  projects,  mining
projects, agriprocessing and other projects valued at more than  R2  billion
which provide employment to more than 2 000 people.

That is, briefly, what we would like to say. But we  acknowledge  that  more
needs to be done in order to ensure that we create a  better  life  for  all
and, of course, we  will  continue  on  this  noble  course.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Father S MKHATSHWA (Salga): Chairperson, the President of  the  Republic  of
South Africa, Mr Thabo Mbeki, hon members, ladies and gentlemen,  thank  you
very much for giving us the opportunity to come and share with you  some  of
our own thoughts regarding the progress that we have made over the  past  10
years. Now, unlike other speakers, we are not going to  be  giving  you  too
much detailed information, too many statistics, for the simple  reason  that
we have a limited amount of time.

Also, another reason is that every year each  and  every  municipality  must
prepare an annual report with detailed information about the  progress  made
on their different responsibilities. We have just produced what is called  a
mid-term report, which is a report on the past two and a  half  years  since
we came into office - especially those of us who are in municipalities.

Thank you very much also, Comrade Naledi, for expressing a wish to see  more
of us. Definitely! We love this forum. It is very  important.  That  is  why
from time to time we send all kinds  of  people  and  members  of  Salga  to
participate in the debate. However, you said something that  I  thought  was
even more interesting. Somehow you alluded to a debate  that  we  have  been
having, namely, that we feel as Salga, that whilst it is good for us  to  be
members here, we also want to enjoy full membership with a  right  to  vote.
So, I thought  that  was  what  you  were  probably  indirectly  suggesting.
[Laughter.] And we welcome that very much.

Secondly, I, being a man of the cloth, also just  want  to  point  out  that
there is a verse in the Bible that says that when you are invited  you  must
stay right at the back until you are invited  to  come  up.  [Laughter.]  So
that is exactly what I did.

On 24 May 1994, in his first state of the nation address, President  Mandela
stated that the time had come for us to define for ourselves what we  wanted
to make of our shared destiny. He mapped  out  a  vision  for  that  destiny
where he emphasised Government's commitment  to  creating  a  people-centred
society bound to the pursuit of the goals  of  freedom  from  want,  freedom
from hunger, freedom from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom  from
suppression and freedom from fear.

 This year, President Thabo Mbeki, in  his  state  of  the  nation  address,
reflected on the hard work over the past few years which has laid the  basis
for a better life for all. He emphasised that at  the  centre  of  a  better
life  for  all  is  the  eradication  of   poverty   and   the   fundamental
transformation of our society into one  that  is  nonracial,  nonsexist  and
prosperous.

The social  statistics  of  the  Ten-Year  Review  confirm  the  rewards  of
Government's progress towards ensuring that better life that was  effectual.
The state has become people-centred. Programmes to  alleviate  poverty  have
brought improvement in the lives of millions of  people.  As  our  President
said earlier this year, truly, the tide has turned,  but  as  emphasised  in
the review, there are still some major challenges that need to be  addressed
as we enter the second decade of freedom.

Ten years ago our challenge was to gain an understanding of what  we  needed
to do to transform our society  and  to  eliminate  poverty.  Today  we  are
beginning  to  see  the  benefits   of   our   policies,   legislation   and
transformation initiatives. Today our challenge is not about  what  we  need
to do, but about how to do it better.

At the heart of improving  our  performance  is  the  issue  of  capacity  -
capacity to implement, capacity to  deliver  and  capacity  to  govern.  Our
challenge is to gain a better understanding of how to develop  our  capacity
and how to improve our performance.

The local sphere of government is at the coalface  of  delivering  a  better
life for all. Over the past few years local government has  been  through  a
substantial transformation process: from the first democratic  elections  in
1995,  through  the  interim   phase,   while   local   government   awaited
constitutional finalisation of its form, as well as awaiting the  new  local
government  policies,  legislation  and  outcome  of  the   demarcation   of
municipal boundaries.

Being at the coalface of Government obviously means  that  when  people  see
local government practitioners and  the  leadership,  they  see  Government.
That is why they will ask us: ``Where are the  schools  and  the  clinics?''
They will ask us about social grants, they  will  ask  about  all  sorts  of
things and services that are provided - sometimes at national or  provincial
level.

They do not understand what we  mean  by  competences  of  provinces  or  of
national  Government.  Hence  the  need  for  us,  all  three   spheres   of
government, to work much closer together. I am happy  to  announce  that  in
some provinces this is beginning to happen already.
Our experience has shown that for many public representatives IDP  is  still
the business of local government - it really has  very  little  to  do  with
them; we see  IDP  as  a  planning  instrument  for  all  three  spheres  of
government. Hence the need for what is  now  being  called  the  intersphere
IDP. It will help to slow down the fragmentation and lack  of  co-ordination
that still sometimes characterise our work.

As  local  government  practitioners,  implementing  the   new   legislative
framework  for  local  government,  we   are   increasingly   finding   that
municipalities are experiencing enormous difficulties in complying with  the
new requirements. In particular, certain sections of the  Municipal  Systems
Act pose a major challenge for municipalities.

It is one of the situations where some laws are  now  beginning  to  deliver
unintended consequences, and therefore our idea now is to look  at  all  the
pieces of legislation that have impacted on  local  government,  to  see  to
what extent we can get them amended in such a  way  that  they  help  us  to
enhance service delivery.

Local government is still dealing  with  unfunded  mandates.  What  are  the
challenges that are facing us? There is also the problem of functions  being
delegated where there is insufficient capacity at the local level to  fulfil
these functions effectively.

The findings of Census  2001,  updated  in  2003,  illustrate  a  number  of
trends, including rapid urbanisation, as well as  an  increasing  number  of
households.  All  these,  again,  are  challenges  that  we  are  facing.  I
therefore say that there  is  an  urgent  need  to  review  equitable  share
allocations  so  that  these  allocations  more   accurately   reflect   the
population statistics. We are in  discussion  with  National  Treasury  with
regard to some of these issues.

We remain  committed  to  our  millennium  targets  for  water,  sanitation,
housing,   electrification,   repairs   and    maintenance    of    existing
infrastructure. However, we will not  be  able  to  meet  these  targets  if
capital investments remain at current levels.

We need to have capacity in order to deliver. The good Latinists  say:  Nemo
dat quod non habet. I am sure some of you will remember that. ``No  one  can
give that which they do not have.'' So,  if  authorities  do  not  have  the
resources, the capacity to deliver the services,  well  obviously,  that  is
not going to happen.

Another  challenge  that  we  obviously   have   to   face   is   inadequate
communication. This applies, I suppose, to all three spheres of  government.
Excellent  work  has  been  identified  as  having  been  done  in  the  284
municipalities. But there are also quite  a  number  of  boo-boos  that  one
encounters - you know, glaring mistakes - because  people  who  are  active,
people who get things done, who work, will sometimes make mistakes.

But what Salga has done, is to come up with a new strategy, namely, that  we
need to encourage peer review. The municipalities and their leadership  must
themselves try to sort out problems that may crop  up  from  time  to  time,
rather than wait for a national  or  provincial  intervention.  That  should
happen only when there is a genuine need for it to be done, as provided  for
in law.

Ladies and gentlemen, let me just mention  one  or  two  other  points  that
perhaps are not  always  mentioned  when  we  discuss  delivery.  There  are
certain intangible deliverables that this Government  has  delivered  on.  I
say intangible, because we cannot always quantify them.

How do you, for instance, quantify the feeling of dignity that many  of  our
people have experienced? They now have self-worth, a pride in what  and  who
they  are,  in  being  South   Africans.   They   are   no   longer   called
``piccaninnies'' or ``boys'' or things like that. They  have  a  feeling  of
respect, of being respected. Instead of being  called  ``Mister'',  we  were
referred to as Bantuman so-and-so. Those  kinds  of  things  are  no  longer
happening now, thanks to this Government.

Yes, we concentrate on the physical and material wellbeing of people,  their
economic wellbeing. That we have to continue to do and intensify, but  I  am
merely saying that there are other more hidden or spiritual  realities  that
have made a difference in the lives of the people.

Finally, I saw a picture of a grisly old  man  hugging  the  President  some
time last week. When I looked at the eyes of that old man, I  am  sure  that
what went on in his heart  was:  Here  is  my  leader,  the  leader  of  the
country. I can touch  him,  I  can  greet  him.  He  is  not  out  there  on
television. He is like us, he is one of us.

I am also quite aware that some children have been visiting  the  President.
Again, this is something  that  is  very  interesting.  Where  do  you  find
children coming to spend three or four hours  with  the  President,  arguing
with him and so forth. Again, that influences the way people think and  feel
and relate to one another.

There is even more racial integration in our  institutions,  including  even
Correctional Services. I have visited hospitals and I have  seen  black  and
white  patients,  black  and  white  criminals  staying  together,   working
together. And I said to myself, this would never have happened before 1994.

Moral regeneration is the last factor. It is also very  important,  although
intangible, but it is there. Thank you  very  much,  ladies  and  gentlemen.
[Applause.]

Me E C GOUWS: Agb Voorsitter, agb President, agb premiers en  lede  van  die
provinsies, gun my net die geleentheid om ook my gelukwense oor te  dra  aan
die Oos-Kaapse premier, ``Stoffel''. Dit  is  ons  premier  en  dit  is  ons
troetelnaampie vir hom. Baie geluk met jou verkiesing, premier Stofile.

Dan wil ek ook net sê hoe teleurgesteld ek is met die swak  smaak  wat  deur
een van die premiers geopenbaar is deurdat hy hierdie platform  gebruik  het
om politieke munt te wil slaan. Dit lyk vir my werklikwaar die DA  is  besig
om sommige mense nagmerries te  gee.  Maar  laat  ons  nie  almal  daal  tot
daardie vlak nie.

Geagte President, dit is goed om stil te staan en 'n  terugblik  te  gee  op
die eerste dekade van  demokrasie.  Daar  was  baie  positiewe  veranderinge
waarvoor ons u krediet wil gee. Vir die eerste keer was Suid-Afrika  werklik
deel van die wêreld en veral die  sogenaamde  ``global  village''.  Dit  was
eensklaps  wonderlik  om  'n   Suid-Afrikaner   te   wees.   Ons   het   die
Wêreldrugbybeker gewen in die goeie ou dae van '95, en  daarna  die  Afrika-
sokkerbeker. Ons spreekwoordelike beker het oorgeloop van vreugde en  trots.
Almal het ons land en die  vreedsame  oorgang  na  demokrasie  aangeprys  en
geloof. Suid-Afrika se  toekoms  het  blink  gewink.  Baie  mense  het  baie
seergekry, maar ook  baie  mense  het  gewys  wat  ware  vergifnis  is.  Ons
demokrasie het gewerk, maar daar was baie groeipyne.

Die eerste vyf jaar was ons nog vrolik op die golf  van  bevryding  en  toe,
meneer die President, het u die leisels oorgeneem. Dit was in  dié  tyd  wat
ons rand 'n nuwe  laagtepunt  bereik  het,  maar  toe  ook  weer  skitterend
herstel  het.  Ons  rentekoers  het  gedaal  en  op  die  oomblik   is   die
inflasiekoers gerieflik laag. Goeie werk, meneer  die  President.  U  geniet
die respek en die agting van die wêreld daarbuite, maar u  moet  nie  u  eie
land opoffer vir die agting van die mense daarbuite nie.  Vanaf  April  2002
tot einde Maart 2003, het u  30  buitelandse  reise  onderneem.  Dít  is  'n
gemiddeld van 2,5 reise per maand. Agb  President,  dit  kos  baie  geld.  U
reise toon 'n oorbesteding van byna  R2,6  miljoen  op  die  Presidensie  se
begroting van R138,7 miljoen. Suid-Afrika se mense  soek  u  híér.  Hier  in
Suid-Afrika het ons genoeg probleme wat eers opgelos moet word  en  ons  het
te min geld daarvoor. Daar is 'n Afrikaanse uitdrukking wat sê:  ``'n  Leier
moet vuur in sy hart hê en 'n kompas in sy kop.'' Dit beteken, die  vuur  in
die hart moet jou mense warm maak, hul naby jou hou en  die  kompas  in  die
kop,  wel,  dié  moet  die  regte  roete  aanwys  om  jou  mense   te   lei.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Hon Chairperson, hon  President,  hon  premiers  and  members
from  the  provinces,  allow  me  the  opportunity   also   to   convey   my
congratulations to the premier of the Eastern Cape,  "Stoffel".  He  is  our
premier and this is our pet name for him. Congratulations on your  election,
Premier Stofile.

Then I would also just like to say how disappointed I am with the bad  taste
manifested by one of the premiers  when  he  used  this  platform  to  score
political points. It seems to me that the DA is really  giving  some  people
nightmares. But let us not all sink to that level.

Hon President, it is good to pause and look back  on  the  first  decade  of
democracy. There were many positive changes for which we want  to  give  you
credit. For the first time South Africa was truly  part  of  the  world  and
especially the so-called global village. Suddenly it was wonderful to  be  a
South African. We won the Rugby World Cup in the good old days of  '95,  and
then the Africa Cup for soccer. Our proverbial cup  was  running  over  with
happiness  and  pride.  Everybody  praised  our  country  and  our  peaceful
transition to democracy.  South  Africa's  future  beckoned  brightly.  Many
people  had  been  badly  hurt,  but  many  people  also  showed  what  true
forgiveness was. Our democracy worked, but there were many growing pains.

The first five years we were happily  riding  the  wave  of  liberation  and
then, Mr President, you assumed the reins. It was during this time that  our
rand hit a new low, but then  also  recovered  spectacularly.  Our  interest
rate dropped and at the moment the inflation rate is comfortably  low.  Good
work, Mr President! You enjoy the respect and esteem of the  outside  world,
but don't sacrifice your own country for  the  respect  of  the  people  out
there. From April 2002 up to the end of March 2003 you  have  undertaken  30
foreign visits. That is an average of 2,5 visits per month.  Hon  President,
it costs a lot of money. Your travels show  an  over-expenditure  of  almost
R2,6 million on the budget of the Presidency, which is R138,7  million.  The
people of South Africa want you here. Here in South Africa  we  have  enough
problems that must be solved first  and  for  which  we  don't  have  enough
money. There is an Afrikaans saying that goes: "A leader must have  fire  in
his heart and a compass in his head." It means, the fire in your heart  must
warm your people, must keep them close to you and the compass in  the  head,
well, it must show the  right  direction  in  which  to  lead  your  people.
[Interjections.]]

Hon President, life is always about choices. It is about what you regard  as
important. More often than not, it is a question of what you regard  as  the
most  important  amongst  all  the  important  matters.  It  is  thus  about
preferences and priorities. That is true for any person, but  especially  so
for leaders. Our personal choices as  individuals  affect  ourselves  and  a
small circle of family and maybe friends. However, the  choices  made  by  a
leader are of much greater significance.

When it comes to a president, his choices have a profound effect on a  whole
country and all its people. Mr President, do you realise how  your  choices,
in other words, your preferences, affect government  policy  and  government
actions? Do you realise how your choices affect the lives of the citizens?

Let me point out a few examples. There is your choice of preferring arms  to
the alleviation of poverty. Think of the  millions  who  could  have  gained
from  the  money   you   preferred   to   spend   on   sophisticated   arms.
[Interjections.] I do not see dark clouds of war  on  the  horizon  for  the
immediate future at least. Why not rather keep your people warm with a  fire
in your heart than blast them away with the fire of a gun? [Interjections.]

Then secondly, there is your choice of preferring not to  see,  on  the  one
hand, the sea of corruption and, on the other hand, the sea of  malnutrition
and suffering children.  [Interjections.]  No  person  can  survive  if  the
little grant they are entitled  to  is  not  being  paid  out  because  some
corrupt official forced their  hands  into  the  social  development  purse.
Please eradicate corruption and the enrichment of the few to  the  detriment
of the needy. [Interjections.]

Thirdly, the choice of vigorously implementing affirmative  action,  instead
of opting for the development and training of all our  people,  leaves  many
of your young South Africans bewildered and depressed.  These  young  people
did not have a hand in history. Yet they are the ones who bear the brunt  of
the decision; they have no choice other than to look for work in  a  foreign
country. They have study loans to pay, they  have  a  family  back  home  to
support and they want to save for the  day  when  they  can  afford  to  buy
property in the land of their birth. [Interjections.] They are young,  loyal
South Africans.

Chairperson, I need your protection. My comrade  here  next  to  me  is  ...
[Applause.] They are young, loyal South  Africans.  They  are  our  sunshine
ambassadors. Yet your decision to deny them their right to vote in the  next
election  with  the  excuse  of   ``not   an   affordable   operation''   is
unbelievable. Some time, somehow, we must get our priorities right. If  this
country is to become a world leader, which is what it  should  be,  then  we
must care about all the people and respect  their  rights.  Only  then  will
everybody be enthusiastic about creating a great South Africa.

We regret your choice to rely on the indefensible  policies  of  a  Minister
instead of insisting on proper medical  care.  Garlic,  olive  oil,  African
potato and lemon cannot cure Aids. Now comes the  rather  late  reaction  to
the threat of Aids instead of immediately countering the pandemic. While  we
were accusing each other and fighting about the reasons  why  Aids  is  with
us, hon President, your people, my people, died. This country simply  cannot
afford this. We want to see the fire in your  heart  save  our  people  from
pain and suffering.

Hon President, we may differ on ways of  how  things  should  be  done,  but
believe me, we all want the best for this country. [Interjections.] That  is
why we are here. We are concerned, loyal South Africans. [Interjections.]

When I was in Tanzania a year or two or three ago,  as  an  observer  during
the elections, I had the opportunity to visit the head office of  a  woman's
organisation. Women's organisations  will  always  be  close  to  my  heart.
[Interjections.]  This  visit  proved  that  the  Tanzanian  women  were  no
exception. Women, after all, form the backbone of society. The  poster  that
those ladies displayed on their notice board caught my eye and  stayed  with
me ever since. The poster read: ``If a lawyer makes a  mistake,  one  person
may be imprisoned; if a doctor makes a mistake, one person may die,  but  if
a  politician  makes  a  mistake  a  whole  nation  suffers.''  Please,   Mr
President, be very careful when taking decisions. That  poster  in  Tanzania
is haunting me! [Time expired.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Agb Voorsitter, wanneer 'n  mens  vandag  terugkyk  na  die
eerste dekade van ons demokrasie, en veral die bietjie  meer  as  vier  jaar
sedert 2 Februarie 1990 wat dit voorafgegaan het, kan ek nie  anders  as  om
vervul te word met 'n diepe dankbaarheid teenoor oor ons Hemelse Vader  nie,
dat Hy ons  as  nasie  weggeruk  het  van  die  afgrond  van  'n  volskaalse
burgeroorlog wat ons geliefde land en al ons mense sou  vernietig  het.  Ons
bring hulde aan ons leiers van daardie tyd  wat  bereid  was  om  met  groot
waagmoed, durf en visie die realiteite van dié land in die  oë  te  kyk,  en
met groot insig en wysheid 'n  wen-wen-oplossing  onderhandel  het,  waarvan
deelnemende demokrasie, gedeelde en samewerkende regering  'n  sentrale  rol
speel.

Terugskouend was dit sonder enige twyfel  in  die  beste  belang  van  Suid-
Afrika en al sy mense dat die Nasionale Party  van  destyds,  onder  leiding
van mnr F W de Klerk, en die ANC, onder leiding van mnr Nelson  Mandela,  en
persone soos u, Mnr die President, met mekaar  onderhandel  het,  oplossings
gevind het,  en  daarná  deelnemende  demokrasie  en  samewerkende  regering
daargestel het.

Ons as nasionaliste is egter deur  die  Konserwatiewe  Party,  die  destydse
amptelike opposisie, uitgekryt as verraaiers en uitverkopers van  wit  Suid-
Afrikaners. As ons na die werklikhede van vandag kyk, kan daar  tog  nie  by
enige denkende Suid-Afrikaner twyfel bestaan dat deelnemende  demokrasie  en
samewerkende regering steeds in die beste belang van Suid-Afrika  en  al  sy
mense is nie. Wat Suid-Afrika nodig het, is  vir  swart-,  wit-,  bruin-  en
Indiërgemeenskappe om uit die verlede te leer en om  hande  te  vat,  én  om
saam te werk om die groot uitdagings van ons tyd,  soos  armoede,  MIV/Vigs,
werkloosheid  en  die  steeds  onaanvaarbare   hoë   vlakke   van   misdaad,
daadwerklik saam aan te pak, en 'n gedeelde en beter toekoms te bou  in  die
beste  belang  van  al  ons  mense.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Hon Chairperson, when one looks back  today  to  the  first
decade of our democracy, particularly the little over  four  years  since  2
February 1990 that preceded it, I  cannot  but  feel  filled  with  profound
gratitude towards our Heavenly Father, that He has plucked us  as  a  nation
from the precipice of a full-scale civil war that would have  destroyed  our
beloved country and all our people. We pay tribute to our  leaders  of  that
time who, with great courage, boldness and vision,  were  prepared  to  face
the realities, and with  great  insight  and  wisdom  negotiated  a  win-win
solution,  in  which  participatory  democracy,  shared   and   co-operative
governance play a central role.

On reflection, it was without a doubt in the best interest of  South  Africa
and all its people that the then National Party, under the leadership of  Mr
F W de Klerk, and the ANC, under the leadership of mr  Nelson  Mandela,  and
people like you, Mr President, had negotiated  with  one  another,  found  a
solution,  and  afterwards  established  participatory  democracy  and   co-
operative governance.

We, as nationalists were however branded as traitors and sell-outs of  white
South Africans by the Conservative Party, who were the  official  opposition
at that time. If we look at the realities of today,  then  surely  no  right
minded  South  African  can  doubt  that  participatory  democracy  and  co-
operative governance are still in the best interest of South Africa and  all
its people. What South Africa needs is for black, white,  brown  and  Indian
communities to learn from the past and to join hands, and to  work  together
concertedly to tackle the huge challenges  of  our  time  such  as  poverty,
HIV/Aids, unemployment and the still unacceptably high levels of crime,  and
to build a shared and  better  future  in  the  best  interest  of  all  our
people.]

Ironically, the official opposition of today, the DA  under  the  leadership
of Tony Leon, is  just  like  the  official  opposition  of  those  years  -
frantically trying to mislead the people into believing that they  can  turn
back the clock and change the direction of the winds  of  change  by,  inter
alia, whipping up the fears and emotions of minority groups and calling  the
New NP traitors and sell-outs for working with the ANC Government to  create
a better future for all our people.

Ironically, their new-found partner, the IFP, is  also  in  Government  with
the ANC, with even more members at national Government level  than  the  New
NP but that, according to the DA, is okay. What kind of logic is  this?  The
DA asks the people to vote for them to keep the ANC out - as in a recent by-
election in a ward in Pietermaritzburg in  which  council  the  ANC  has  an
absolute majority and where this  could  not  change  because  of  that  by-
election.

Likewise, at national level, the DA is trying to  mislead  the  voters  with
posters proclaiming ``You can fight crime,'' ``You  can  fight  for  jobs,''
and ``You can change the country'', thereby indicating one  of  two  things:
either that people can fight crime on their own, change  the  country,  etc,
or that by voting for the DA, people can fight crime,  change  the  country,
etc. Whichever of these two interpretations one gives to these posters,  the
fact remains that they are false and misleading in the extreme  because  the
DA cannot do anything to fight crime on their own. They  cannot  change  the
country in any positive way on their own either,  simply  because  they  are
not in a position of power to do so  -  there  isn't  the  slightest  chance
whatsoever that they will be in such a position of power in our  lifetime  -
and furthermore because they  have  no  influence  whatsoever  on  the  ANC-
controlled governments anywhere.

The only thing that they can do is to change the country for  the  worse  in
the sense that they  could  isolate  a  large  number  of  people  from  the
minority groups from any decision-making in this  country,  if  they  should
succeed in their fervent attempts to mislead these South Africans  from  the
minority groups. The stark contrast between the posters put  up  by  the  SA
Police Service to the effect that ``Together we can fight crime'', is  there
for all to see. The true position in South Africa, in respect of the  police
posters, is, namely, that it is only together that we as South Africans  can
build our country and overcome the many challenges facing us.

I was again struck by the vital importance of working  together  to  address
problems during the last few days when  I  was  able  to  lead  the  New  NP
delegation to meet with the Minister of Safety and Security and  the  Deputy
National Police  Commissioner,  within  hours  after  having  requested  the
meeting, to discuss the unfortunate arrest of Magistrate  van  der  Walt  at
Groblersdal in a solution-orientated way.

The immediate, well-considered,  absolute  and  clear  assurances  given  by
Minister Nqakula to judicial officers, and the immediate  appointment  of  a
high-level investigation, under the leadership  of  the  national  chief  of
detectives, again proved the commitment of this Government to  the  rule  of
law and the independence of the judiciary. This had the immediate effect  of
limiting the opportunity for parrot-like critics to fear-monger and whip  up
emotions.

In this regard I also wish to thank the President for the remarks  he  made,
according to  press  reports,  on  Sunday  in  Phoenix  in  respect  of  the
electoral law and the possibility of relooking  at  the  question  of  South
Africans overseas voting in  the  election.  Our  viewpoint  regarding  this
matter  has  been  made  clear  to  the  President  and  ANC  leaders  in  a
constructive and solution-orientated manner.

Ek wil graag, soos ek begin het, in Afrikaans afsluit, want ek wil graag  in
my moedertaal as 'n wit, Afrikaner man - en daarom deel van die  etniese  en
taalminderheidsgroepe in dié land - maar ook  as  'n  mede-Afrikaner  en  'n
mede-Suid-Afrikaner, én as leier van die Nuwe NP in dié Raad,  my  vandag  -
Wapenstilstanddag - die 11de dag van die 11de maand 2003, met  al  die  erns
waaroor ek beskik tot my landgenote rig en 'n beroep op hulle doen  om  soos
ek en die Nuwe NP en ons leier, wat ook hier  is  vandag,  die  uitgestrekte
hand van welwillendheid van hierdie President  -  ook  ons  President  -  te
neem.  En,  ten  spyte  van  die  verskille  wat  nog  tussen  ons  en   die
meerderheidsparty is, en waarom ons sal voortgaan  om  opbouende  interaksie
met hulle te hê, saam die uitdagings van hierdie  land  oplossingsgerig  aan
te pak, sodat ons saam 'n beter, gedeelde toekoms vir ons  en  ons  kinders,
en al Suid-Afrika se mense hier in hierdie geliefde land - waar ook  ons  'n
geboortereg het - kan help bou.

Ek pleit by hulle om nie toe te laat dat hulle mislei word  deur  sinnelose,
korttermyn en valse politieke  propaganda  wat  geen  verband  hou  met  die
werklikhede van Suid-Afrika nie. Die politiek  en  die  arrogansie  van  hul
leier ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to conclude, as I started, in Afrikaans,  because  I  want  to
use my mother tongue as a white, Afrikaner man - and therefore part  of  the
ethnic and language minority groups in this country - but also as  a  fellow
Afrikaner and fellow South African, and as leader of  the  New  NP  in  this
Council on this day - Armistice Day - the 11th day of the 11th  month  2003,
to direct myself in all seriousness to my  fellow  citizens  and  call  upon
them, like the New NP, our leader and me,  to  take  the  extended  hand  of
goodwill of this President - also our President. And despite  the  remaining
differences between us and the majority party, and why we shall continue  to
interact with them constructively, together  to  tackle  the  challenges  of
this country with a view to finding solutions, in order to help to  build  a
better, shared future for ourselves and  our  children,  and  all  of  South
Africa's people in this beloved country - where we also have birthright.

I plead with them not to allow themselves to be misled by senseless,  short-
term and false  political  propaganda  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  the
realities of South Africa. The politics and the arrogance  of  their  leader
...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, hon member! I'm  afraid  your  time  has
expired.

Mr P A MATTHEE: I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, after reading about what  Mr  Essop  said  about
the President's suitcase in the early days of his life, I just want  to  say
to you, Mr President: Don't unpack your suitcase. I know that  South  Africa
is always critical of people who travel.  They  used  to  criticise  General
Smuts, yet he brought more investment to this country than  anybody  in  our
history, and he was vilified for travelling. I know how tough it is,  and  I
know how difficult is, and  I  know  how  lonely  it  is.  Don't  lose  your
ambition for South Africa, and don't stop travelling and making friends  for
South Africa. That's all I want to say to you.

In politics people inevitably make mistakes. Often these can  be  corrected.
What is vital, though, Mr President, is that we  do  not  make  mistakes  on
issues which are irreversible or of an intergenerational magnitude.  I  thus
wish to request sincerely that you consider my recent appeal  to  Government
to introduce a moratorium on the further application and use of  genetically
manufactured organisms and cereals  in  South  Africa  until  more  credible
research is done.

I want to say simply, because my time is so limited, Mr President, that  the
worldwide insurance and reinsurance industry, which you would  know  is  one
of the most sophisticated in the world, will not give  insurance  cover  for
the possible effects of genetically manufactured organisms on public  health
or on the environment. They compare the risks to  thalidomide  or  asbestos.
Those risk analysts know their business. They won't take chances with  their
money. The questions is: Are we going to take a chance on  our  people  that
insurance companies won't take? We can't risk the health of our people,  our
environment,  our  agricultural  economy,   our   exports   and   our   food
sovereignty.

I want to say to the President that the large multinationals are a new  form
of  colonialism.  It's  food  colonialism,  and  food   colonialism   breeds
dependency. The large US multinationals involved have recently been  stopped
or sidelined in Europe, Australasia and Africa. Over 37 countries  worldwide
have already enacted laws to restrict imports and  to  regulate  consumption
by requiring the labelling of food containing GM  ingredients.  Inter  alia,
the British Medical Association - and a more hallowed  body  than  that  you
cannot get - warns of the possible long-term dangers to health of  consuming
what the Daily Mail calls ``these Frankenstein foods''.

Other  important  scientific  authorities  warn  of  the  real  threats   to
biodiversity and to the environment. In this week's  Mail  &  Guardian,  you
can read an article headlined: ``GM crops face  ban''.  But  here  in  South
Africa we are failing to act in spite of the overwhelming evidence  that  is
building up. By not acting we threaten our  biodiversity,  one  of  Africa's
greatest gifts to the  world.  We  endanger  the  long-term  health  of  our
people, already reeling under a health assault.  We  rob  our  consumers  of
their freedom of choice as  to  what  they  may  eat,  because  we  have  no
labelling or consumer legislation in place on genetically modified food.

We compromise the independence of particularly our small farmers  in  Africa
who traditionally keep seed over  for  planting  the  following  season.  If
these people get their way, Mr President,  next  year  those  small  African
farmers will have to go to the US corporation Monsanto for some  more  seed.
We need to look at these things in the face of  overwhelming  evidence  that
should caution us.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!

Mr K D S DURR: There is a major trend towards organic and natural foods.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, hon member! Your time has expired.

Mr K D S DURR: I can say no  more.  I'll  send  in  my  speech.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE:  Chairperson  and  hon  President,  the  millions  of  South
Africans who queued for long hours in the blazing sun, thirsty  and  without
meals and water to drink, could perhaps be the relevant people  to  evaluate
to what extent the  Government  has  satisfied  their  needs.  The  decline,
coupled with the lethargy on the part of new interest  to  go  and  register
for the coming elections, serves  as  an  effective  instrument  to  measure
their views in response to our performance.

This dragging of feet and  the  decline  in  interest  signify  one's  inner
feeling. It could be that we have not performed to the expectations  of  the
majority of South Africans, let alone the constitutional imperatives. It  is
a serious warning and thus calls for introspection.

Having served on a cluster of select committees for almost four years, I  am
left with no doubt that  the  Government  has  achieved  its  objectives  of
transformation. A great number of pieces of  legislation  have  been  passed
with a view to meeting the imperatives  of  our  Constitution;  needless  to
mention the roll-out of social grants, the globalisation of our economy  and
the great amount of work done on land reform.

The public is perturbed by the media  reports  of  corruption  practised  by
both political office bearers and state organs. Practices of bias,  cronyism
and favouritism in the tendering sector have become the norm.  Functionaries
in all spheres of government have fallen into the trap  of  this  temptation
and it has tainted the image of Government, despite the good  job  that  the
Government has done. Self-gratification has become dominant at  the  expense
of the tenets of just administration practices such as equity, fairness  and
justice. We must tighten our screws, Mr President, and come  up  with  zero-
tolerance regulatory measures.

One of the challenges facing us in the next decade is unemployment  and  the
narrowing of the gap between the rich and the  poor.  South  Africa's  entry
into  the  global  economy  has  compelled  the  manufacturing  industry  to
restructure their businesses and in the process job  losses  were  bound  to
occur.

I commend the Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism  -  I  am  a
member of that committee - for the effective manner in  which  it  addresses
the problem of unemployment. It employs 7% of  South  Africa's  work  force,
and it is projected that by 2010  more  than  1,2  million  people  will  be
employed.  I  think  Minister  Valli  Moosa  owes  us  the  secret  of   his
department.

It is true that we cannot point fingers at Government and cry  for  jobs.  A
lot can be done in our own backyards. The pursuit of primary agriculture  at
home or at village level could be a fitting example. Given that  agriculture
contributes 2,6% to our gross domestic product, and most importantly, 9%  of
formal employment, its importance cannot be overemphasised.

Primary farming, be it livestock, piggies or cash crops  is  ideally  suited
to the rural sector. What is  more  important,  these  examples  of  primary
agriculture call for the provision of infrastructure  development,  such  as
access roads, electricity, mechanisation and agricultural co-operatives.

Perhaps one should ask this question: Why not offer tax concessions  to  the
farmers who are battling to employ people and perhaps  address  the  problem
of unemployment? May I rest my case at this point? [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon President, premiers, comrades, ladies  and
gentlemen, I would be failing in my duty if I did not  comment  on  the  hon
Gouws's speech. Hon Gouws is trying to use this platform to  complain  about
our President's travelling abroad, and so  forth.  I  can  assure  you,  hon
Gouws, that the President is not having a nice holiday abroad.  He  is  busy
with very serious matters relating to  our  country.  What  I  have  noticed
about the DA is that they  just  continue  to  complain  and  complain.  Our
President is going to other countries  and  speaking  to  businesspeople  to
come and invest money in this country so that we can  create  jobs  for  the
poorest of the poor. So stop crying about  the  President  flying  overseas.
[Interjections.] We must be serious in what we do; we  must  not  use  these
things for tacky politics. We are sick and tired of the DA.

Before 1994 we had  to  deal  with  the  draconian  laws  of  the  apartheid
government, where there was no rule of law and where the law only  served  a
particular section of the South African population.  The  primary  focus  of
national security was to  secure  and  advance  the  interests  of  a  white
minority and the apartheid regime.

The ANC-led Government has expanded the  notion  of  national  security  and
positioned it within the ambit of a human rights security paradigm.  Instead
of applauding the  justice  system  and  crime  prevention,  the  opposition
parties deliberately do not want to  acknowledge  the  achievements  of  our
democratically elected Government in fighting and combating crime.

The police, in particular, are subject to varying degrees of  oversight  and
control by both the executive  and  legislative  branches  at  national  and
provincial  levels,  and  above   that   by   the   Independent   Complaints
Directorate. Our transformation programme has seen the restructuring of  the
police  management  and  of  about  500   specialised   units   into   three
multidisciplinary units focusing on organised  crime,  serious  and  violent
crime,  and  commercial   crime.   The   introduction   of   the   automated
identification system enabled the police to trace 300  previous  convictions
this year, compared to a figure of  163  369  last  year.  The  system  also
allows  the  police  to  expand  services  to  include  the  palm   printing
identification system.

We in the ANC  are  sensitive  to  the  issue  of  farm  killings  and  have
established a rural safety programme, which will see the phasing out of  the
commando system, and whose functions will be  rationalised  with  the  South
African Police Service.

The National Crime Prevention Strategy emphasises that crime is  not  merely
a security or law enforcement issue, but it is a social issue. The  National
Crime Prevention Strategy therefore integrates crime  into  a  socioeconomic
development priority for our country. It has resulted in important  projects
that have borne good results and partnerships with Business  against  Crime,
the integration of the  justice  system,  the  establishment  of  a  witness
protection programme, as well as a victim empowerment programme.

The national crime combating strategy and  integrated  justice  system  have
borne visible results. There is evidence  that  the  ANC-led  Government  is
making an impact on the crime situation, and the  serious  crime  levels  in
South Africa have continued to come down.  Our  resolve  is  to  make  South
Africa crimefree. We applaud the work that is being done  by  the  community
policing forums in our cities and  towns,  whose  aim  is  to  combat  crime
holistically.

This  shows  that  our  communities  are  responsive  to  the   Government's
mechanisms for fighting crime. Another of our sound successes  is  the  fact
that with regard to high-profile crimes  such  as  aggravated  robbery,  car
hijacking, truck and robbery, in-cash transits and bank  robberies,  serious
inroads have been made and these crimes are therefore  decreasing.  Analysis
of crime trends as reported by the Minister of Safety and  Security  at  the
national,  provincial  and  special  levels,  clearly  indicates  that   the
national crime combating strategy, popularly known as  Crackdown,  has  been
sustained and is stabilising and decreasing the impact of crime.

The NCCS, with its geographic approach of focusing on crime  prevention,  is
paying off. The integrated efforts of crime prevention  operations  such  as
Siyachuma and Fikila have  yielded  positive  results  in  fighting  serious
crimes. The ANC-led Government has also dealt effectively with  the  spectre
of right-wing extremism and urban terror, and we commend the  investigations
that led to the convictions of Pagad members. As we speak, there  are  those
who are behind bars for treason.

The murder of police officials remains a source  of  paramount  concern  for
both the South African Police and the  public.  During  the  financial  year
under review 150 police officials were murdered. We acclaim the Ministry  of
Safety and Security for the launch of the death grant scheme for members  of
the South African Police Service, which will be a once-off payment  of  R200
000 to the dependants of a member who dies  as  a  result  of  extraordinary
circumstances relating to the performance of duty.

We know that life cannot be equated to  a  monetary  value,  but  with  this
gesture we will go a long way in assisting the families of police  personnel
who are murdered on duty. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, His Excellency the President, hon  Premiers  and
Speakers, hon members of Salga and my  colleagues,  today  is  a  red-letter
day, not only because  this  plenary  is  attended  by  His  Excellency  the
President and a contingency of hon premiers, but, more importantly,  because
it is a day on which we can look back with admiration or disappointment  and
account for our performance to our constituencies or support bases.

Owing to time limitations, I intend to deal with only one issue. One of  the
most significant achievements of the new South  Africa  in  the  North  West
province is in the  area  of  land  restitution.  Several  communities  have
regained possession of their ancestral land from which they were  forcefully
removed during the yesteryears.

In addition to this, the redistribution of state funds to  potential  buyers
is also progressing at a fairly moderate pace and  the  present  indications
are that the land grabs taking place in  our  northern  neighbour  will  not
happen here, as the  President  once  assured  some  panicstricken  farmers'
unions.

The only point of discontent in respect of these farms is that they are  not
utilised profitably or to their maximum potential. In the Gysdorp area  near
Delareyville, and the Ramatlabama area near Mafikeng a number of farms  that
were allocated to farmers by the previous government  have  collapsed  owing
to climatic conditions. The  farmers  are  in  arrears  with  their  rentals
and/or interest. Most of them have lease contracts with  an  option  to  buy
the farms, but are incapacitated and prevented from  proceeding  further  by
the rental arrears.

The Government is requested to consider the  advisability  of  consolidating
such rental arrears and other debts into the purchase price of the  farm  so
as to allow the prospective buyers to  go  ahead,  in  order  to  break  the
present deadlock.

Crop farming is very expensive and can ruin a  prospective  emerging  farmer
within one year. Pastoral farming or ranching, on the other  hand,  is  less
expensive and if emerging farmers could be guided to  follow  this  type  of
farming and to plant pastures for their stocks, they could make  the  grade.
The market for growing vegetables is  unlimited  and  our  emerging  farmers
should be encouraged. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
Ms B N DLULANE: Mr President, Sir,  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  premiers,  hon
members, first of all let me  just  ``ndizithabathele  ithutyana  ndibhekise
phaya kuMa Gouws'' [take a few minutes and respond to hon Ms Gouws].

Ms Gouws, surely there would have been something wrong if the  ANC  had  the
same priorities as the DA. It is not surprising  to  hear  the  DA  ``incoma
ukuphumelela kwethu iNdebe  yeHlabathi''  [commending  us  for  winning  the
World Cup]. But whilst we don't have any problem with that, our  feeling  is
that the DA should rather commend the ANC-led Government for  its  successes
on issues of poverty alleviation and those that are related  to  the  rights
of the people in general.

Let  me  go  back  to  my  speech.  The  ANC,  through  its  vision  of  the
Reconstruction and Development Programme, realised that  the  vast  majority
of our people lived in abject poverty and were  kept  there  by  the  racist
apartheid rulers. This means that when we  came  into  power  we  understood
that we needed immediately to begin the process of social redevelopment  and
transformation. We had to pay particular attention to the ways in  which  we
could provide relief to our poor and vulnerable  citizens;  more  precisely,
to the RDP vision. The ANC stated that we needed to transform, and I  quote:



  ... social welfare policies, programmes and delivery  systems  so  as  to
  ensure that basic welfare rights are  provided  to  all  South  Africans,
  prioritising those who have been historically disadvantaged.

One of the first measures put in place by the  then  Department  of  Welfare
was to deracialise social  services.  Many  of  us  remember  how  huge  the
discrepancy was between what white old age pensioners received  compared  to
what our own grandparents received. Of course, the other disadvantaged  race
groups received progressively less pension than white pensioners,  with  the
majority black pensioners being at the lowest  end  of  the  scale.  Now  no
matter the colour of your skin, if you  qualify  for  social  security,  you
receive the same amount as everyone else without exception.

Yiloo nto  ke  endothusileyo  ngoMam'  uGouws,  ukuqala  ancome  inkulumbuso
yephondo lakhe, kodwa akwazi ukugxibha uMongameli welizwe  kwakuba  kwenzeke
ezi zinto zintle azincoma ngayo inkulumbuso yephondo lakhe. (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[That is what surprised me about Ms Gouws, for commending  her  own  Premier
first and then having  the  audacity  to  criticise  the  President  of  the
country when she commends her Premier about good things  that  she  can  see
are happening in the province.]

Social Development has also tried to  reach  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable
wherever they find themselves. So even if you live in the remotest  part  of
the rural areas, you would find the Department of Social Development  trying
to bring social security services to potential beneficiaries.

This process of reaching out to all our  communities  has,  of  course,  had
some failures. These include  mobile  services  not  reaching  the  outlying
districts or that  there  are  insufficient  mobiles  for  the  demand;  the
absence of official documentation showing that an applicant  qualifies;  and
corrupt officials and the like.

``Ebetshilo ke noNkulumbuso okokuba'' ...  [As  the  premier  stated  ...  ]
despite these and other challenges, the  Department  of  Social  Development
has shown a steady increase in the number of beneficiaries across all  grant
categories.

The expenditure on social security has increased significantly  since  1994,
from R10 billion to R34,8 billion  to  date.  Additionally,  the  number  of
beneficiaries has increased from 2,6 million recipients to 6,8  million  for
the same period.

Ukuba ungakhe uphinde ujonge ezinye zeendawo esithi siqhwalele kuzo,  siyile
Ndlu  yoWiso-mthetho  sikuyo  sikhe  saphuma  iphulo  sajikeleza  sikhangela
okokuba le mibono mihle kangaka yokuba kubekho abantu abaya kuthi  bancedise
ekususeni  ezandleni  zikaRhulumente  inkqubo  yobonelelo  loluntu  (welfare
system). Kodwa sifumane umnqa wokuba kusekho  oozingel'  ichele,  aba  bathi
bayile  ezi  zinto  ekuthiwa  zi``zikopari''.  Baguqule  nje  igama   elithi
``oomatshonisa'' laba ``zizikopari''.

Ngumbono ombi ke lowo obonisa  okokuba  lo  gama  isebe  linika  abenkamnkam
kunye  nabezibonelelo  zikaRhulumente  iimfanelo  zabo,  kukho  oomatshonisa
abahlalele  ukuthabatha   ezo   mali   zincinci   zabo   bantu   basokolayo.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Perhaps you could look again at those problem areas  that  we  seem  to  be
failing to attend to. I must also  mention  that  we,  as  Parliament,  have
undertaken a fact-finding mission in order to establish the  role  of  those
people who are assisting with our welfare system. But to  our  surprise,  we
found chancers, people who were  referring  to  themselves  as  ``zikopari''
["scorpions"]. What that means is  their  actions  suggest  that  they  just
changed the name ``loan sharks'' to ``zikopari.''

This is really a horrible situation which  undermines  the  efforts  of  the
Department of Social Development. While the  department  is  busy  providing
social pensions and benefits to the needy people, there are loan sharks  out
there who are stealing money from the poor.]

Social Development  also  inherited  a  highly  fragmented  social  security
system. The departmental audit for the period between 1994  and  1999  cited
14  different  departments  which  administered  social  services   to   the
different population groups, including the welfare  systems  of  the  former
homelands. These  disparate  systems  provided  inequitable  and  fragmented
services which failed to meet the  development  needs  of  the  people.  The
realignment and amalgamation of Government departments also brought its  own
administrative nightmares, such as poorly  equipped  offices  and  personnel
who had low levels of capacity.

Kodwa ngenxa yeenkqubo zikaRhulumente  ezikhoyo,  zinikwa  ingqwalasela  ezo
zinto. [However,  because  of  the  existing  government  programmes,  these
problems are being attended to.]

And, as we speak, so many people in the Public  Service  are  well  equipped
with many skills that they did not have before.  The  primary  challenge  of
the Department of Social Development is to eliminate all hindrances  to  the
prompt payment of social grants. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E RASOOL (Western Cape): Chairperson and hon President, over the last  10
years when we did the  review,  the  Western  Cape  has  often  stood  in  a
twilight situation with regard to the progress that  has  been  made  across
the country. We shared in many of the national achievements, but were  often
held down by the state of our province as we went forward.

I must say that if I were the hon member Gouws  I  would  have  spoken  with
much more humility about what is possible, especially because we saw the  DA
in action in this province when they were in government. We have seen  under
the government of the party of which she is  a  member  uninterrupted  white
privilege and the  belief  that  it  would  go  on  forever.  We  have  seen
heightened coloured fearfulness and dependency  as  the  feelings  of  those
communities were exploited to  the  maximum,  and  we  have  seen  continued
African marginalisation as they were called ``Oos-Kapenaars''  and  made  to
believe that they did not belong in a place like the Western Cape.

It was 20 months ago, Mr President, that the ANC-New  NP  co-operation  came
into being and we formed a coalition government in  this  province.  It  was
this coalition government between the ANC and the New NP that  gave  us  the
opportunity to start changing the mood in the  Western  Cape.  It  was  this
coalition that created a new discourse to deal with our challenges,  not  by
simply labelling our problem as being a migration problem from the north  or
from the east, but by dealing  with  it  in  a  discourse  of  nonracialism,
speaking  about  the  development  of  all  our  people   and   co-operative
governance rather than blaming the bad things  on  the  national  Government
and claiming the good things as the achievements of the  DA  government.  We
could speak the language of partnership.

Indeed, Mr President, we have turned an atmosphere of scandal  into  one  of
greater dignity for our people. We  were  able  to  turn  instability,  when
there were revolving doors for premiers and mayors in  this  province,  into
stability, and we could turn years of neglect into an atmosphere  of  caring
for all our people. Therefore I think that we have increasingly  moved  away
from fearfulness amongst our people,  racial  fearfulness  particularly,  to
tentatively getting people to reach  out  across  the  colour  divides  that
existed. The removal of all this baggage began to allow us to  get  on  with
the job.

The job, Mr President, that you had set for us was an imposing one. In  your
opening speech to Parliament this year you  said  that  we  must  move  from
welfare dependency to economic self-reliance and that is  an  imposing  job.
In July you added to the burden of that job by saying that we  have  got  to
integrate a second economy with a first economy, if  we  are  going  to  get
economic self-reliance on the agenda.

So, we face major challenges for the Western Cape and for our  country.  The
first  challenge  I  want  to  speak  about  is  indeed  the  challenge   of
partnership. Across the board, from the things that you said, Mr  President,
to what all the premiers had reported and many other speakers had  reflected
in this notion of a 10-year review, we get the distinct impression  that  if
Government was not there, there would be no  bulwark  against  poverty,  and
that puts partnerships into some kind of perspective.

Everything that has been done to keep our people  away  from  the  abyss  of
poverty has largely  been  because  Government  has  introduced  free  basic
services and free health care, and extended the social  safety  net  through
welfare and child support grants, through pensions  and  through  increasing
the value of pensions and their reach.

Indeed, Mr President, if those interventions had not taken place, I  shudder
to think what would have happened to the statistics and  the  indicators  of
poverty in this country. What  it  basically  begins  to  tell  us  is  that
Government is often called upon to carry the burden against poverty  all  on
its own, and  that  the  partnerships  that  we  are  calling  for  are  not
meaningful, have not been responded to adequately  and  indeed  we  need  to
take into the second decade of freedom a  far  more  meaningful  partnership
where we hold our social partners to account for their interventions.

The second challenge is certainly at the level of  skills.  The  Chairperson
has been a member of a task  team.  I  want  to  look  into  human  resource
development in the Western Cape. I  simply  want  to  quote  one  statistic,
which deals with the sample of  African  learners  doing  maths.  The  total
number of African learners in schools doing maths was just over 5 400.  Only
approximately 270 of them did it on the higher grade. Of these, in the  year
2002, only 162 passed. It showed a complete absence of  numeracy  foundation
amongst our learners.
The absence of teachers to teach maths and the absence of the choice  to  do
maths in certain schools and the absence of teaching  aids  to  learn  maths
all translate into an absence of  a  meaningful  future  for  the  next  few
generations that come out of our schools.

This is but one  indicator  of  the  skills  challenge  that  we  face  and,
therefore, if we go into the second decade, we have to do so on the back  of
greater human resource  development  plans  for  our  people,  to  make  our
unemployment and unemployability problem one that we can manage.

To end, I think the third major challenge is  the  one  of  building  equity
within our society, both in the  Western  Cape  and  the  country.  The  two
economies that we speak  about  may  simply  be  a  national  reflection  of
globalisation on the whole, had it not been specifically colour-coded,  that
the first economy is dominated and owned largely  by  whites,  although  not
exclusively, and those who are in  the  second  economy  are  largely  black
people.

Therefore I think that the second decade must not only  see  an  integration
of the two economies but a symbiosis between the two. The one must  be  able
to feed off the other and there must be mobility between  the  two.  Greater
equity,  particularly  racial  equity,  must   be   achieved   through   the
enforcement of the  mechanisms  for  black  economic  empowerment  and  SMME
development. We must also insist on  geographic  equity,  because  too  many
rural towns, black and coloured townships are simply places where people  go
back to sleep without any viable development.

I think that those are the three major issues that we have to take into  the
second decade of freedom if, indeed, we  are  to  succeed.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson,  hon  President,  hon  Ministers,  hon  members,
fellow comrades and friends, this debate represents yet  another  moment  of
celebration of unity in diversity. It has represented a nation in  dialogue,
busy redefining and shaping its future in the global map of  nation  states.
It has done so, proud of the past nine years and confident  of  the  future.
The millions of people of this country are proud and inspired that,  through
the leadership of the  ANC,  together  with  other  political  parties,  the
endemic political violence that had  defined  the  lives  of  innocent  men,
women and children in KwaZulu-Natal and on the trains in  Gauteng  has  been
brought to an end.

Surprisingly, as representatives of the people gathered here in this  august
House to celebrate  this  glorious  past,  some  amongst  us  have  had  the
audacity to tell us about their obsessions with  their  personal  power  and
privileges. I do not think that is the focus of the debate  this  afternoon.
The focus of the debate  this  afternoon  for  all  representatives  of  the
people gathered in this august House, across party-political  lines,  is  to
honestly assess the extent to which we as the representatives of our  people
have gone further to make their lives better. But few  people  have  focused
on this issue.

As we  take  a  step  forward  and  prepare  ourselves  for  our  democratic
elections we do so proudly and enthusiastically, at that. The Government  of
the people has done well for them and has made a mark on the continent  with
its conviction and  determination  that  this  century  will  indeed  be  an
African century, and its commitment to good governance in  an  Africa,  free
of corruption.

We come from a past where governance  was  largely  defined  by  a  security
doctrine with little respect for the rule of law; where the abuse  of  power
and injustice was the order  of  the  day;  where  what  was  practised  was
contrary  to  good  governance  and  promoted  corruption,  corruption  that
undermined the principles of accountability, integrity and transparency.

What we  inherited  therefore  was  a  fragmented,  corrupt,  unethical  and
ineffective public sector. However, that has  changed  as  we  are  gathered
here today, for only one reason: because millions  of  the  people  of  this
country queued on 27 April 1994 to vote for the government of their  choice,
led by the ANC.

As we are debating here today we want to  make  a  clear  statement  to  our
detractors that the people of  our  country  will  never  be  distracted  by
statements  that  are  sowing  hopelessness  for  them,  namely,  that  this
Government will not deliver. Our Government has made remarkable progress  in
transforming the state machinery, to make it more responsive  to  the  needs
of its citizens and more accountable. There is no other  government  in  the
history of this country, not only in South Africa  but  continentally,  that
has had the successes that the ANC-led Government has.

 Our Government is engaged in a vigorous process  of  transformation,  which
is geared towards creating a democratic society based on the  principles  of
nonracialism and nonsexism. The progress achieved in the 10 years  that  our
Government has been in power has been recorded in  particular  in  terms  of
voice and accountability. Today we have a voice. The voice of our people  is
heard right here within the corridors of power, unlike before.

Today we have political stability in this country, which we never  witnessed
before  the  27  April  1994  democratic  breakthrough.  Today  we  have  an
effective Government and regulatory frameworks which ensure that no  citizen
is above the rule of law. Today we have  a  Government  with  integrity  and
legitimacy, where everyone has the right to make choices about his life.

Central to these accomplishments has been our undoubted commitment  to  good
governance and anticorruption. Driven by a conviction  to  create  a  better
South Africa that is free of corruption, numerous anticorruption  programmes
and projects were put in place. I shall just mention a few.

In 1997 the  Government  sectors  responsible  for  the  SA  National  Crime
Prevention Strategy established a programme committee to work on  corruption
in the criminal justice system. I am not sure where hon Gouws was  when  our
Government  initiated  that  particular  programme,  because  today  she  is
singing a hymn of corruption. After 1999 the National  Anticrime  Corruption
Summit was held in Cape Town with the purpose of discussing  the  importance
of the elimination  of  corruption  in  both  the  public  and  the  private
sectors. The National Anticorruption Forum  was  established  in  2001.  Hon
Gouws must listen to this very carefully. To add, a review and  revision  of
anticorruption legislation was  conducted,  whose  end  results  was  a  new
Prevention of Corruption Bill which was developed later.

Last but not least, the Public Finance  Management  Act  was  introduced  in
1999. Its sole purpose was to improve accountability within  Government  and
to Parliament.  This  simply  illustrates  our  Government's  commitment  to
combating any form of corruption. I  hope  his  Excellency  the  Premier  of
KwaZulu-Natal is also bound by some of these laws which this Government  has
enacted without any protest.

Good governance is without any doubt not only a prerequisite  but  essential
for sustainable development, not only  in  South  Africa  but  also  in  the
broader Africa, in order for us to be  a  success.  Good  governance  as  an
exercise of power by all levels of government  must  be  effective,  honest,
equitable,  transparent  and  accountable.  Our  past  has  taught  us  that
corruption will never bring prosperity and peace, and that  good  governance
is the fuel that takes the truck of progress forward. It is that which  will
turn our visions, dreams, hopes and ambitions  as  an  African  people  into
reality.

Therefore, without that fuel the truck cannot move. It is  in  that  context
that it is only the ANC that does  not  only  preach  about  corruption  but
fights  it,  irrespective  of  who  commits  it.  Our  commitment  to   good
governance and anticorruption does not end in South Africa  but  extends  to
the broader Africa. For South Africa  to  succeed,  Africa  must  succeed  -
hence our undoubted commitment to the objectives  of  Nepad.  Anticorruption
and good governance are therefore imperative to Africa's success. It  is  in
this context that Nepad is reflective of the  current  democratic  wave  and
the move towards good governance and prosperity, so that  this  century  can
indeed be our own.

Through  Nepad  our  leaders  have  made  a  commitment  to  strengthen  our
political and administrative frameworks ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam  Chairperson,  I  will  not  exceed  my
three minutes! Chairperson and friends,  the  hon  Premier  Mtshali  made  a
campaign speech for the elections. I hope he will pardon me,  therefore,  if
I don't respond to that. We'll respond during the election campaign. I  will
gladly do that. [Interjections.]

I received some communications from the leader of the FF, Dr Pieter  Mulder,
as well as some reports about concerns of the New NP. These had to  do  with
the matter that the hon Matthee just raised about electoral law  and  people
who might unavoidably be travelling on election day. We have discussed  this
matter. I have since spoken  to  the  Leader  of  Government  Business,  the
Deputy President, and indeed will be taking up this matter, because I  think
the matter that both the FF and the New NP raised with  regard  to  this  is
reasonable. And I am sure  steps  will  be  taken  to  make  sure  that  the
necessary amendment is done to ensure that people who  will  unavoidably  be
travelling have the possibility to vote. [Applause.]

Generally the Government, with regard  to  genetically  modified  organisms,
GMOs, has sought to be  very  careful  and  cautious  about  this,  and  the
existing legislation  has  sought,  among  other  things,  to  address  this
question that the introduction  of  these  organisms  into  the  country  is
carefully handled. I have received a number of communications, in  the  last
two or three weeks, from the general public  about  this,  and  indeed  have
discussed it with  both  the  Ministers  of  Agriculture,  and  Science  and
Technology. We are looking at this matter to  see  what  else  needs  to  be
done. This is a matter that was raised by the hon Kent Durr.

We had a meeting recently with the Working Group on Agriculture. Two of  the
questions have been raised here, Madam Chairperson. One of them  has  to  do
with land redistribution and was raised by the hon Marthinus van  Schalkwyk,
Premier of the Western Cape, and  the  other  one  was  raised  by  the  hon
Tlhagale with regard to the viability of the farms acquired by people  as  a
result of the process of land redistribution. It relates to  issues  of  the
profitability of these farms, and what might need to be done. Both of  these
matters were discussed at that working group meeting with  both  AgriSA  and
Nafu.

I am not certain, Madam Chairperson, that there is a need  to  call  a  land
summit  on  the  redistribution  matter,  because   indeed   there   is   no
disagreement about the need to move faster towards achieving this  objective
that we have set, of 30% within a particular period. What we are looking  at
is what practical steps to take to get there. I don't  really  believe  that
it requires a summit for us to restate an agreement that exists between  the
farmers and the Government on this. It's really a matter  of  ensuring  that
we are able to move with the necessary speed.

As I indicated, Madam Chairperson, with regard to the matter raised  by  hon
Tlhagale, we discussed that matter too - of the burden the new farmers  have
to carry, which in some instances makes farming not  viable  for  them.  And
again, I am sure with regard to that we will take some steps.  So  they  are
not matters that have been ignored.

I would say to the hon Nyakane from the UDM that I would not  be  too  quick
personally  to  draw  conclusions  with  regard  to  the  matter  of   voter
registration. He spoke about warning signals as a  phrase  which  was  quite
ominous - a serious warning. I wouldn't be so quick about this. I  am  quite
certain that all of us in the  room  can  see  great  enthusiasm  among  our
people to participate in the elections, great interest in  their  Government
and what the Government should be doing. And I do  not  believe  that  there
exists, among our people, a  certain  sense  of  disillusionment  such  that
these dire warnings should be given. And the people will register.

But I think what is critically important,  is  that  all  of  us,  including
members of this Council, should indeed go out among the people to  encourage
them to register, and that we should go out among the people to assist  them
to overcome problems that still do exist, of access to  identity  documents.
I think that's the response. I honestly do not believe that  there  is  much
to worry about in the sense of people being disillusioned with one thing  or
the other, as a result of which they will not be registering  or  voting.  I
don't think it will happen, but I think we must  get  out  to  mobilise  the
people and assist to solve problems. That includes solving  the  problem  of
IDs that have been issued and are not  collected  or  delivered,  which  sit
around in the offices, in very large numbers. I think that  we  can  assist,
and I think all of that would help, indeed, to move forward this process  of
registration.

The hon premiers of  Gauteng  and  the  North  West  raised  this  important
question with which indeed I agree. We have to discuss this matter  at  some
point in some depth. Because, yes, indeed,  the  hon  Ebrahim  Rasool  quite
correctly referred to the positions that  the  Government  has  taken  as  a
bulwark  against  the  further  impoverishment  of  the  people.  It's  been
critical intervention over the last nine and a half  years  -  critical  and
necessary.

We've done all of the work that people referred to, of ensuring that  people
entitled to social grants get them. Important campaigns have been  run  with
regard to this to make sure that indeed people do have access. This  is  all
very important work. But indeed we have to look  at  this  question  of  the
balance between  that  social  expenditure  and  economic  expenditure  that
produces the resources so that  you  can  engage  in  that  kind  of  social
expenditure.  We  can  get  to  a  situation  where  our  levels  of  social
expenditure become unsustainable. We don't want to get  to  that  situation,
but I am saying I agree with the premiers  that  we  have  to  address  this
matter.

A few years ago we had a look at this  question  in  comparison  with  other
countries. We looked for instance at South Korea. And  proportionately  they
were spending less on social expenditures than on economic  expenditures.  I
am not saying that was a good thing, but that's what they  were  doing.  And
one of the things that was happening was that  they  were  attaining  higher
rates of growth and expansion of the economy than we are doing. But  it's  a
matter, I think, that we indeed have to look at quite closely, because  it's
a matter that cannot be dealt with just on a voluntarist  basis  -  that  we
just decide to  spend  so  much  on  social  expenditure  and  there  is  no
consequence to it. There is a consequence to it, and I  think  that  perhaps
in the new year we should indeed focus on this matter quite sharply.

I would like to say to the hon Kent Durr that I am glad about  the  comments
that he made about the foreign engagement of this country, and to  say  that
actually it's not going to stop. It's actually going  to  grow,  and  that's
the reality, that's a fact. And  the  reason  for  it,  apart  from  matters
mentioned here by hon members to do with mobilising foreign  investment  and
so on, or part of the reason, is that the things that our people  have  done
over the last ten years - the matters that  hon  Matthee  referred  to  even
before 1994 - serve as inspiration to the entirety of humanity.

We were in the United States not so long ago for the United Nations  General
Assembly, and met the leadership of the Council on Foreign Relations.  These
are very important people -  big  business,  diplomats,  newspaper  editors.
It's the top of US society. And they were asking what we want them to do  to
observe the tenth  anniversary,  the  decade  of  the  liberation  of  South
Africa. They want to do some major programmes  in  the  United  States.  And
they said part of the reason for that was that as  they  looked  around  the
world they could see no example better than South Africa over the  last  ten
years ... [Applause.] ... which has given so  much  hope  to  the  whole  of
humanity. And they say you can look  at  every  respect.  You  can  look  at
politics and constitutional things,  look  at  the  economy,  look  at  race
relations, look at the gender issue, look at any issue - you will find  that
there is no country that can actually compete with South  Africa.  And  they
said, therefore, their celebration of the 10th  anniversary  in  the  United
States also had something to do with communicating  particular  messages  to
themselves as Americans as  to  what  they  should  do  to  meet  their  own
challenges.

That is general. The peoples of the world are  immensely  inspired  by  what
the people of South Africa have done. It is true that there are some  people
who don't know this. I am talking about our own citizens. And  as  a  result
of that inspiration there are many, many people around  the  world  who  are
asking: Can you please come and work with us? Talk to us,  do  whatever,  to
help us also make this movement forward.  What  inspires  me  a  great  deal
about our people,  Madam  Chairperson,  is  a  very  deep  seated  sense  of
humanism among our people. And they respond. It's another  human  being  who
says: Can you please come and help? Our people will respond.
Premier Stofile was just telling me here that the MEC  for  Agriculture  has
been asked by a number of countries within  the  SADC  region  to  come  and
visit them to discuss agriculture and to see what has been done.  They  ask:
``Can you help us in the region?'' And the MEC must go. He has  to  go.  And
that is affecting everybody.

 Our Chairperson here ... I get told about her in many places.  I  was  told
about you last week, Chairperson. [Laughter.] It was  in  Canada,  and  they
were talking about a meeting that you had in Bangladesh. They told me  about
things that you did and said there, and the impact that  you  had  on  these
other parliamentarians. They thanked  me  for  releasing  our  parliamentary
leaders to interact with these processes.

So, I am saying, hon Kent Durr, I agree entirely with  you.  South  Africa's
role in the rest of the world is not going  to  diminish,  it  is  going  to
increase. It is inevitable, but it is also correct.  We,  as  this  country,
ought to be particularly sensitive to the fact that we  owe  our  liberation
in good measure to other people in the world. [Applause.] I  think  we  need
to be sensitive to that.

The hon Marthinus van Schalkwyk spoke about headlines in the  newspapers  in
1993, and indeed I think he is correct. People have made comments about  the
advances that we have made over the past nine and a half years,  which  have
indeed been very big.

There are not many in our country - and may that story be  told  one  day  -
who know  how  delicate  the  situation  was  in  the  country  around  this
transition, how many fires threatened to break out, and  what  was  done  to
make sure that none of them broke out, or what had to be done after that  to
ensure that we did not have this explosion that many people  expected,  even
after 1994.

There are many people who do not know these things. Maybe let  me  put  this
differently, and tell you a story. A couple of years ago I  was  talking  to
one of the leaders in the mining industry. We were  debating  the  issue  of
mineral rights and that legislation which was still in draft form. You  will
remember the position that some of them took with regard  to  the  issue  of
mineral rights.

I said to him that perhaps one of the things that people do  not  understand
is that where, for example, you have this Minister of Minerals  and  Energy,
Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who is saying that we should address  the  issue  of
mineral rights, that in reality she is standing between the mine owners  and
the masses of our people. If she stood aside and said  to  these  masses  of
people, ``Do as you wish'', they would  not  talk  about  laws.  They  would
react differently. They would ask why mineral rights in  their  country  are
individually owned by other people. They would say:  ``It  is  our  national
heritage.'' They would respond differently. I say  she  stands  between  the
mine owners and the masses of the people who would act very  differently  if
she stepped aside.

I am saying many people do not know that, and many people do not  appreciate
that. An enormous amount of work has had to be done in this country to  make
sure that we have this thing which some  people  call  a  miracle.  We  have
moved a great deal in all respects.

But to come back to the matter of the headlines that the hon  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk was raising, I am not a particularly great fan of  newspapers,  so
I do not know quite what they write. But I will be very, very  surprised  if
they say, in a way that is constant, that  the  biggest  challenge  that  we
face in this country is poverty. I will be very, very surprised if they  say
that. They will carry headlines about all manner of other things, and  these
will be built up as the big issues of the day.

The big, fundamental issue that faces millions of our people is poverty.  It
is a central, key quest. It is not poverty only in the sense of hunger,  but
it  is  poverty  in  the  sense  of  absence  of  good  medical   care,   of
opportunities to get a job and of a road in a rural area.  All  of  that  is
poverty.

We are working on the very first comprehensive report  that  the  Government
will issue about causes of death in our country since 1996.  I  regret  that
that report is not available yet. We are working on it  now,  basing  it  on
the documents and the notices of death that are submitted  to  the  Minister
of Home Affairs when people die.

I am absolutely certain that what you will see there, certainly with  regard
to the black majority in this country, is  the  impact  of  poverty  on  the
health of our people, death from  diseases  of  poverty.  It  will  be  very
clear. But I am saying that I am not  quite  sure  whether  this  particular
challenge is presented in our media for what it is.

 I am raising that to say that I think  that  as  we  go  into  this  second
decade of  our  liberation,  we  really,  all  of  us,  need  to  make  this
resolution. During the first decade we had to  meet  particular  challenges,
including ensuring that we did indeed take our country through  in  the  way
that has happened. We set up these new Government institutions, we  did  all
of the things that needed to be done. But  proceeding  from  that  base,  we
must, during the second decade, deal with this issue in the  ways  that  the
hon members have indicated and in the ways that we try to indicate.

In that regard, therefore, I think you are quite correct to  have  made  the
comments you made about the NCOP, correct in  the  sense  that  we  have  to
answer the question in that context of this decisive struggle that  we  must
wage and win against poverty.

Is this institution properly placed to play its own  role  in  that  regard?
Are the provincial and local governments that are represented here  properly
placed to play their roles in that regard? I am saying that it  was  correct
to raise those questions in that context. And perhaps we will need  to  come
back to that question, in the same way that I think all of us will  have  to
come back to the question of what it is that we do as a country together  to
defeat this threat of poverty.

With all of the implications that poverty has, it is a struggle  that  I  am
quite certain we will win, as we have won other difficult struggles  before.
But to win is going to require that we do indeed act together around a  very
clear programme as to where we think  we  should  go.  Certainly,  from  the
point of view of Government,  we  are  very  committed  to  moving  in  this
direction, and we would want to do everything possible to make sure that  we
get to where we need to get.

This is the month of Ramadaan. To those of our colleagues who  are  Muslims,
we wish them well. We will say happy Eid when the time comes. And  if  I  do
not come back here before Parliament closes, a merry Christmas and  a  happy
New Year to everybody. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order, hon members! A colleague  told  me  that
she had to wait for some time with an international member of  an  executive
of a particular country who was to meet one of  our  own  executive  members
whose plane was unavoidably delayed. And she tells me  she  kept  saying  to
the person it would only be another two minutes. Our  hon  executive  member
eventually arrived and they had an excellent meeting. The  person's  comment
to our colleague after the meeting was: ``You South Africans, I  will  never
forget your two minutes!'' [Laughter.] Mr President, I will not forget  your
three minutes. [Laughter.]

That concludes the  debate.  May  I,  on  behalf  of  the  NCOP,  thank  the
President, both for his presence and for the excellent debate that  we  have
had. This will be - and we have to be humble in saying this -  the  last  of
our annual reviews in this term of Parliament, and  it  has  indeed  been  a
great association  with  our  President.  We  have  deeply  appreciated  the
relationship that the President has had with this House. We  also  wish  the
hon President a merry Christmas, a happy New Year and all success.

Hon members, may I request that you remain seated until  we  have  left  the
Chamber - you know who ``we'' are.

The Council adjourned at 19h00.
