                               POINTS OF ORDER

                                  (Rulings)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, before we proceed to the  business
of the day, I wish to deliver two rulings  on  points  of  order  that  were
raised during the plenary of 18 March 2003.  The  first  ruling  concerns  a
point of order raised by Mr N M Raju at the plenary.

At our plenary on 18 March the hon Mr Sulliman moved a motion regarding  the
fact that the 2003 Cricket World  Cup  had  reached  the  semifinal  stages,
congratulating Kenya on their achievement  in  advancing  to  the  semifinal
stage and congratulating the  organisers  of  the  World  Cup,  and  further
indicating the hope that the success of the 2003  Cricket  World  Cup  would
increase South Africa's chances of hosting the 2010 Soccer  World  Cup.  The
hon Mr Raju raised a point of order to the effect that the same  motion  had
been moved by himself at the sitting of the Council in  Taung  on  12  March
2003.

Having had the opportunity to consider both motions, I  am  of  the  opinion
that while they both refer to the 2003 Cricket World  Cup,  they  deal  with
different aspects thereof. Mr Raju's motion,  in  essence,  related  to  the
loss suffered by  the  South  African  cricket  team  and  called  on  South
Africans to support the Kenyan and Zimbabwean teams, which were  still  part
of the contest at that time.

Since the motions are not  substantially  the  same,  Mr  Sulliman  has  not
transgressed Council Rule 75(2)(a) and the motion is therefore  not  out  of
order.

The second ruling  concerns  a  matter  raised  during  the  debate  on  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Fourth Amendment  Bill.  During
this debate on the date mentioned, 18 March 2003,  the  hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena
raised a point of order regarding the speech which  had  been  delivered  by
the special delegate from KwaZulu-Natal, the hon Mr V Naicker.  In  essence,
the point of order related to whether Mr Naicker was  allowed  to  speak  on
behalf of his political party, namely the IFP, or whether  he  was  expected
to put forward the view as contained in the  mandate  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal
legislature.

The Chairperson of Committees, who was the officer presiding  at  the  time,
indicated to the hon Mokoena that he was not raising a valid point of  order
and allowed Mr Naicker to continue.

Before the end of the debate the hon Mr Sulliman raised a point of order  to
the effect that Kgoshi Mokoena had indeed raised a valid point of order  and
asked that  the  Chairperson  of  Committees  make  a  ruling  thereon.  The
Chairperson of Committees responded by saying that the  matter  had  already
been closed.

It is clear from the  speakers'  list  that  Mr  V  Naicker  was  a  special
delegate representing the provincial legislature of  KwaZulu-Natal.  Section
61(4)  of  the  Constitution  provides  that  ``the  legislature,  with  the
concurrence of the Premier and  the  leaders  of  the  parties  entitled  to
special delegates in  the  province's  delegation,  must  designate  special
delegates, as required from time to time, from  among  the  members  of  the
legislature''.

The special delegates, like the permanent delegates  in  the  Council,  wear
two hats. They are members of particular parties  and  are  able  to  convey
that during their speeches,  but  on  section  76  matters  they  must  vote
strictly in accordance with the provincial mandate. The  principle  is  that
the allocation of time should be used to canvass the mandate for  which  the
time has been allocated. In this case the time had  been  allocated  to  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal.

The important principle is that when it comes to section 76  voting  on  the
issue, the special delegate is bound by the mandate of the province  and  is
obliged to execute that mandate in voting.  During  the  voting  process  on
that day, the mandate of KwaZulu-Natal was clearly conveyed.
Although I do not wish to labour the point, it  is  worth  noting  that  the
KwaZulu-Natal legislature has, on occasion, sent two special delegates  from
different parties, and the time allocated to  the  province  has  then  been
equally shared by the two speakers. I think we need say nothing  further  on
this matter. These are the rulings that  we  table  before  the  House  this
afternoon. [Applause.]

                              CROSS-OVER PERIOD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the cross-over period starts tomorrow;


       (b)  the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony  Leon,  welcomes  MPs  and
           MPLs from other parties who support its policy and principles to
           join its ranks;
       (c)   the  DA  seeks  a  mandate  from  voters  to  create  a  strong
           alternative to the ANC ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, I wonder if  you  could  use
the microphone, because it seems that there are  members  who  are  keen  to
hear  what  you  wish  to  say.  They  may  be  considering  their  options.
[Laughter.]

Ms C BOTHA: Sorry, Madam Chair. It's better from here.  Must  I  repeat  the
motion?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: If you would.

Ms C BOTHA: I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the cross-over period ...

[Interjections.] You can come, Joyce! [Interjections.]


           ... starts tomorrow;
       (b)  the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Leon,  welcomes  MPs  and
           MPLs from other parties who support its policy and principles to
           join its ranks;


       (c)  the  DA  seeks  a  mandate  from  voters  to  create  a  strong
           alternative to the ANC - indeed, the political struggle in South
           Africa is developing into a competition between the ANC and  the
           DA;


       (d)  those who share its vision are welcome to join their party; and


  (2) acknowledges that the DA regrets that members  of  the  NCOP  who  so
       clearly want to join  are  not  enabled  to  do  so  by  the  present
       legislation.

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Is  there  any  objection  to  the  motion?
[Interjections.] The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

 THE CHALLENGE OF BUILDING AND SUSTAINING A HUMAN RIGHTS CULTURE IN TODAY'S
   WORLD AND THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF CHAPTER 9 INSTITUTIONS IN PROMOTING
                          DEMOCRACY IN SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Chair, hon members of the National  Council  of  Provinces,  colleagues  and
friends, in 1994 South Africa emerged from a past  that  denied  our  people
their humanity and dignity. As we approach  a  decade  of  freedom  we  take
pride in the wealth of human rights achievements in our wake  and  now  look
forward to another decade filled with new and interesting challenges.

The past eight years has seen our Government, armed with  what  is  arguably
one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, putting  together  a
solid foundation  for  rights  realisation.  Building  on  this  foundation,
Government  has,   since   1994,   carefully   constructed   the   intricate
architecture  that  has  supported  and  will  continue   to   support   the
development and growth of our constitutional  democracy.  Our  approach  has
been holistic and incremental, with a distinct emphasis on  the  social  and
economic development of our people.

The ongoing social and economic development of  our  people  builds  on  the
historic achievement of our political freedom on that extraordinary  day  in
April of 1994 when millions of people flocked  to  polling  stations  across
the  country  to  deliver  a  clear  mandate  for  the  transformation   and
reconstruction of our  society.  During  the  immediate  afterglow  of  that
momentous transition from pariah state  to  international  citizen  of  good
standing, we closed one of the darkest chapters of the world's  history  and
began the long road to the reconstruction of our society.

The ANC was the first  to  recognise  that  the  struggle  had  taken  on  a
distinctly new profile. The movement recognised that the  international  and
domestic euphoria at the miracle of South Africa's political  freedom  would
have to be contextualised within the social  and  economic  reality  of  the
vast majority of our people. The path towards the achievement of a  socially
just people-centred dispensation  would  prove  to  be  the  single  biggest
challenge to face any government in modern history.

As you know, the Truth and Reconciliation  Commission  will  hand  over  its
final report to our President, Mr Thabo Mbeki, on  Friday,  the  anniversary
of our national Human Rights Day. The reports of  the  commission  chronicle
the trials and tribulations of a microcosm of  what  was  a  national  human
tragedy. And as we acknowledge the work of the TRC this  coming  Friday,  it
is perhaps a good time to reflect on the significance and symbolism of  this
event.

When our President receives the report on behalf of  the  citizens  of  this
country, we should perhaps  reflect  again  on  the  extent  of  the  damage
inflicted upon our society  by  decades  of  institutionalised  deprivation,
domination  and  discrimination.  This  reflection  should  strengthen   our
resolve to fight poverty and underdevelopment and to  renew  our  commitment
to reconciliation and social justice.

Our Constitution has provided a legislative framework for the reform of  our
society, our economy and our  institutions.  Guided  by  the  Constitution's
vision of a free and  democratic  society,  Government  has  embarked  on  a
series of legal, programmatic and institutional  interventions  designed  to
give substance to the rights enshrined in our Bill of Rights.
Our  primary  challenge  now  is  to  reduce  the  gap   between   ambitious
legislative measures and actual delivery on the ground. That is to say,  our
challenge now is to make rights real. Millions of our citizens are not  only
capable of playing an active part  in  this  process,  but  are  exceedingly
willing to do so. At the end of this  month  Government  will  engage  in  a
series of imbizos throughout the country to renew its  contact  with  people
from all walks of  life.  These  imbizos  provide  an  ideal  interface  for
Government to engage with communities to renew the  partnerships  that  have
been established and  to  explore  opportunities  for  further  constructive
ventures between Government and its civil society partners.

These imbizos, more than anything else, emphasise  the  importance  attached
by Government to the business of  bringing  our  Constitution  to  life  and
sustaining it through ongoing  dialogue,  interaction  and  discourse.  They
provide a  unique  opportunity  to  share  experiences  and  enhance  mutual
understanding. The feedback that  we  get  from  communities  also  provides
invaluable information that guides us  in  improving  service  delivery  and
enhancing the mechanisms that impact positively on community development.

Apart from civil society, Government also relies  heavily  on  other  social
partners, in labour and in the private sector, to assist in translating  our
constitutional rights into reality and to accelerate  the  pace  of  change.
The agreed framework for change is one of sustainable  development,  and  it
is especially the rights of the poor and marginalised that are the focus  of
Government's transformation efforts. The degree to  which  we  are  able  to
synergise the capacities of Government  with  those  of  its  transformation
partners will determine the success of our efforts.

In his State of the Nation address in  February  this  year,  the  President
observed  that  our  people  are  developing  a  strong  sense   of   common
patriotism, despite resistance among some. Our country occupies an  honoured
place among the nations of the world as part of the  global  forces  working
for the progressive transformation of our common universe. None of this  has
happened  on  its  own.  It  is  the  outcome   of   the   elaboration   and
implementation of correct policies since 1994.

To  maintain  the  current  pace  of   change,   we   must   intensify   our
implementation capacity and adopt a practical  approach  to  nation-building
in our country. The President identified realistic and achievable goals  for
us when he opened Parliament earlier this  year.  These  were  not  randomly
chosen areas of work. They were the result of a concerted  and  concentrated
effort by Government to strengthen the human rights culture in our  country.
Areas of work that the President prioritised include  the  expanded  service
delivery to our  people;  improvements  in  the  efficiency  of  the  Public
Service; increased  social  and  economic  investment;  the  elimination  of
corruption; and further improvements within the criminal justice system.

The President referred also to the challenge  of  eradicating  poverty,  the
single factor most inhibiting to releasing the innate potential of  all  our
citizens and according them the dignity to which they  are  entitled.  South
Africa does not stand alone in the fight  against  poverty.  Our  challenges
are not  unique.  In  fact,  we  have  come  to  realise  that  these  acute
development challenges have strong regional and continental imperatives.

As a continent, we in Africa have come to realise that peace is an  absolute
prerequisite for development. And by peace we mean not  merely  the  absence
of formal hostilities, but rather the total absence  of  violence.  We  also
know that war cannot be contained and isolated; its impact resonates  across
continents and cultures.

We are therefore extremely concerned about recent developments in Iraq.  And
as we watch events unfold in that arena, we might  do  well  to  recall  the
words of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his observation  on  the  impact
of globalisation on human rights and on development in its  broadest  sense.
He said:


  Today, no walls can separate humanitarian or human rights crises  in  one
  part of the world from national security crises in another.


  What begins with the failure to uphold the dignity of one life,  all  too
  often ends with a calamity for entire nations.

The Budget recently announced by our Finance  Minister,  Mr  Trevor  Manuel,
underwrites Government's absolute commitment to social development within  a
framework of sustainability and human rights. It is also  the  first  Budget
that has earmarked, within the Safety and Security  cluster,  resources  for
the specific protection of vulnerable groups,  namely  women,  children  and
the elderly.

Violence against women  and  children  is  a  powerful  deterrent  to  their
development and the full enjoyment of their human  rights.  The  Safety  and
Security cluster will  continue  to  strive  for  an  improved  response  to
violence  directed  at  our  women  and  children  through  integrated   and
situation-specific programmes that link strongly with  the  efforts  of  the
Social cluster departments.

As a means of addressing the human rights challenges that  face  Government,
we have developed a National Action Plan for the  Promotion  and  Protection
of Human Rights. This comprehensive plan addresses the requirements  of  all
the rights contained in our  Bill  of  Rights.  Government  will  in  future
mainstream this NAP into all Government plans. But these plans  will  be  of
no avail  if  Government  does  not  vigorously  continue  the  campaign  to
interact actively with our people.

It is our obligation to educate citizens not just about their human  rights,
but also about their human rights responsibilities. By supporting people  in
asserting their fundamental human rights through various initiatives in  our
communities, we will improve considerably our collective  ability  to  reach
out to the abused, the poor, the disadvantaged and victims of  human  rights
violations. The assistance and co-operation of  Chapter  9  institutions  in
the implementation and monitoring of our NAP  are  critical  to  the  plan's
success.

In addition, I have an observation to make  about  the  institutionalisation
of democracy. If we are  to  develop  a  culture  of  human  rights  in  our
society, we must actively support  the  various  institutions  that  sustain
that democracy.  This  very  institution,  our  national  Parliament,  is  a
particular case in point. In addition, we need  to  nurture  and  strengthen
the various Chapter 9 institutions created  by  our  Constitution  with  the
specific  purpose  of  enhancing  democratic  development.  Our  Chapter   9
institutions, created to support and  strengthen  constitutional  democracy,
have made significant contributions to enhancing  a  human  rights  culture,
protecting gender equality and strengthening the democratic  values  of  our
Constitution among the people of South Africa.

Because of the legacy of apartheid and its  record  of  gross  human  rights
violations, the Constitutional Assembly made a conscious decision to  create
independent institutions that would support democracy. Indeed,  the  Chapter
9 institutions as we know them today have become an  integral  part  of  the
constitutional architecture of our country.

At the launch of the South African Human Rights  Commission  in  1996,  then
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki observed  that  regardless  of  our  past,  and
indeed because of it, South Africa  was  committed  to  the  continuous  and
sustained material and spiritual upliftment of individuals and  our  society
as a whole. The adoption of this stance further committed South Africa to  a
rights-based approach to governance within a framework of  transparency  and
fairness. The creation of Chapter 9 institutions  therefore  gives  concrete
expression to the principles and visions  of  our  Constitution,  and  their
work must and can contribute to the attainment of a free and  just  society,
free of discrimination, patriarchy and domination.

Recent work done by the Human Rights Commission in the  Eastern  Cape  is  a
concrete example of  how  Chapter  9  institutions  can  contribute  to  the
realisation of rights. I  believe  that  these  institutions  will  play  an
increasingly important role in assisting  the  people  of  this  country  to
exorcise the spectre of our  discriminatory  past,  so  that  we  can  fully
achieve  our  individual  and  collective  potential  as  envisaged  in  our
Constitution.

Rights realisation cannot be  achieved  without  addressing  the  structural
causes of poverty and disempowerment. Our challenge now is to  identify  and
cultivate a socioeconomic and political common ground that enhances a  human
rights culture. I believe that the inscription on  South  Africa's  coat  of
arms, the highest visual symbol in our new democracy, can guide us  in  this
new era. The motto, !ke e:/xarra//ke, is written in the Khoisan language  of
the /Xam people, the  oldest  known  inhabitants  on  the  southern  tip  of
Africa. It means literally, ``Diverse people unite.''  It  calls  for  unity
and diversity and the recognition of a common humanity, regardless of  race,
class or gender. Thank you. [Applause.]

[Mrs J L KGOALI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of Justice,  hon  members,  it
is a great honour for me to be participating two days  before  we  celebrate
our Human Rights Day.]

Our Constitution is the supreme law of this country, and Chapter 2  of  this
Constitution is the Bill of Rights, which outlines the  cornerstone  of  our
democracy. The Bill of  Rights  enshrines  the  rights  to  equality,  human
dignity, freedom and  security  of  the  person,  freedom  of  religion  and
belief, freedom of expression, the right to be free from slavery,  servitude
and from forced labour, and numerous other rights and freedoms. In fact,  we
have been praised by the international community for having one of the  most
democratic institutions in the world.

But despite all our efforts as Government,  we  find  that  the  fundamental
rights of our people are still being trampled upon. In a report done by  the
Human Rights Commission in July and August 2000,  the  stories  of  ordinary
South Africans, told at public meetings on racism, paint  a  gloomy  picture
of our new democracy. These stories  were  gathered  from  people  from  all
walks of life, across the length and breadth of this country.

Ke rata ho qolla profensi ka nngwe, dintho tse etsahalang ka  mora  hore  re
amohele Molaotheo ona wa rona oo re o tlotlang hakana, o bileng o  tlotlwang
ke matjhaba. Profensing ya  Kapa  Botjhabela  ...  (Translation  of  Sesotho
paragraph follows.)

[I would like to talk about each province, and the things that happen  after
we adopted our Constitution, that we respect so much, that is  respected  by
other nations. In the Eastern Cape province ...]

... for example, a story was told  of  black  children  in  an  area  called
Swartkops, who were threatened with violence for playing in  an  area  where
white children were supposed to be playing.

As for the Free State, incidents were recounted of workers who  were  beaten
and shot by farm owners. Also, there were disturbingly high  occurrences  of
abuse of farmworkers in the form of underpayment,  irregular  working  hours
and other surprising ways that the people talked about in those gatherings.

In  my  own  province,  in  Gauteng,  the  Commission  for  Gender  Equality
explained that black women  were  subjected  to  more  intense  subjugation:
firstly as black South Africans, and secondly as women. The CGE showed  that
only seven percent of companies express a  preference  for  employing  black
women, and then they are more likely to be employed in unskilled  positions.
A young woman explained how she had been promised  a  promotion  from  part-
time to a full-time cashier when a  position  became  free.  But  when  that
position became free, it was given to a white woman.

In KwaZulu-Natal, several submissions were discussed  on  the  treatment  of
people who are living with HIV  or  are  HIV-positive  and  have  Aids.  One
individual said that the common perception that Aids  was  a  black  disease
had contributed to the country's failure to fight this  epidemic.  Therefore
they, whoever, do not have any interest in discussing anything that  has  to
do with Aids because they are not affected, and  it  is  a  disease  of  the
black people.

In Mpumalanga, a story was told of a person  who  quarrelled  with  a  white
worker at a sugar factory near Nelspruit. Thinners was poured on  his  face,
leaving him partially blind. To add to  this  insult,  he  was  subsequently
fired from the company. In negotiations with his employers, he was  promised
compensation, but to date it has  not  happened.  Because  we  do  not  have
money, at times we fall victim to having lawyers coming from the state,  and
some of the state lawyers are actually racist lawyers that are paid  by  the
taxpayers of this country.

In the Northern Cape, one black woman reflected  that  racism  is  not  only
about white people oppressing people with darker  skin.  In  her  case,  she
experienced discrimination  for  speaking  English  well  and  having  white
friends. She was called ``Little Miss White Princess'' and ``Mrs English''.

In Limpopo, a farm worker at Alldays farm did not  return  home  from  work,
and his mother was told by the farmer that he had been beaten  up  and  that
they did not know where he was. His headless body was  found  in  the  river
and, after examination by the police, his  death  certificate  said  that  a
crocodile had killed him. When his head was found, without  any  sign  of  a
crocodile bite, a new death certificate was issued, and  it  said  ``unknown
disease''.

In the North West, the home of  simmering  racial  tensions  in  schools  in
Vryburg, and also in Jerricho, is one of the issues that we  have  to  worry
about.

In the Western Cape,  low-income  housing  was  cited  as  evidence  of  the
prevalence of racism. The size, quality and location of  these  houses  were
seen as insulting. For example, the houses built in Philippi East have  open
toilets facing the living rooms. Even though these  hearings  were  held  in
July, there are still far too many cases of ordinary  citizens'  fundamental
human rights being violated.

Right here in the Western Cape, in the Cape Flats, in this province, in  the
last two weeks we have seen the news of  how  innocent  children  have  been
killed merely for being  in  the  wrong  place  at  the  wrong  time.  Whole
communities are being held hostage by gangsterism. Clearly we need  to  work
together, both  as  the  communities  and  as  Government,  to  outlaw  this
gangsterism.

Communities know who the perpetrators are. They know where  they  live.  Not
speaking out on their activities should be far  more  frightening  than  any
threats that gangsters make to individuals.  In  the  long  run,  harbouring
criminals could eventually lead to your own  child  having  the  same  thing
that happened to Tyrone Steenkamp ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr A E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Voorsitter,  Suid-Afrika  het  'n  grondwet  wat  in
hoofstuk 9 'n onderbou bied om individuele regte te beskerm en uit  te  bou.
Maar individuele regte is egter van min belang  as  hierdie  regte  van  die
gemeenskappe waarbinne dit  gesetel  is,  nie  beskerming  geniet  nie.  Die
Grondwet van Suid-Afrika doen dit ook. Artikel 185  van  die  Grondwet  maak
egter voorsiening vir die beskerming en bevordering van taal-,  kultuur-  en
godsdiensgemeenskappe se regte, en hierdie kommissie  behoort  binne  enkele
maande 'n werklikheid  te  word.  Die  advertensie  vir  die  benoeming  van
kommissarisse behoort reeds volgende week te verskyn. Ek doen 'n  beroep  op
alle belanghebbendes uit alle  taal-  en  kultuurgemeenskappe  om  mense  te
nomineer wat die saak kan dien.

Die Afrikaanse gemeenskappe het talle organisasies wat die  gemeenskappe  op
hierdie gebied kan dien, maar dit  is  'n  leemte  by  die  meeste  inheemse
gemeenskappe.  Die  Afrikaanse  gemeenskap  is  bereid  om  die  bevoorregte
posisie waarin hy is, aan te bied, en wil dit graag aanbied,  om  die  ander
gemeenskappe by te  staan  om  op  hierdie  gebied  georganiseerd  te  raak.
Onthou, die Afrikaanse gemeenskap was gedurende die  Britse  oorheersing  in
dieselfde posisie as baie van  die  inheemse  taal-  en  kultuurgemeenskappe
nou, en het daaruit gegroei. Die wiel hoef nie van vooraf uitgevind te  word
nie. Kom ons werk saam op die  taal-  en  kultuurgebied  -  wat  'n  basiese
mensereg is - en maak Suid-Afrika werk vir 'n beter lewe vir al die mense.

Dit was ons van ons voorvaders geërf het, mag  nie  deur  ander  vertrap  of
deur ons self geminag word nie.

Die agb  Kgoali  het  verwys  na  menseregtevergrype  in  Suid-Afrika,  maar
wanneer ons daaroor praat, moet ons ook kyk na  die  behandeling  van  Suid-
Afrikaners in ander wêrelddele. Aan die begin  van  verlede  jaar  het  twee
jong Suid-Afrikaners tydelik in Doebai in 'n hotel gewerk. Op  16  September
2002 is hulle beskuldig van diefstal en in die  tronk  gestop.  Van  daardie
dag af het ek begin onderhandel vir hulle vrylating. Ek  moes  telkens  hoor
dat ons eerder die proses sy gang  moet  laat  gaan,  want  dit  is  nie  'n
regstaat nie, daar is nie 'n uitleweringsooreenkoms met Suid-Afrika  nie  en
mense se hande  word  daar  nog  afgekap,  ensovoorts,  ensovoorts.  ``Don't
stir,'' is daar vir my gesê.

Op 25 Februarie 2003 het die saak voorgekom - vyf en 'n half  maande  later,
maande wat hulle sonder verhoor  in  die  tronk  gesit  het.  Die  seuns  is
onskuldig bevind, maar uit respek vir die sjeik aan wie  die  hotel  behoort
wat hulle aangekla het, het hulle ses maande tronkstraf gekry, waarna  hulle
gedeporteer sou word. Die deportasie kon nie plaasvind nie, omdat die  hotel
hulle paspoorte gehou het  en  Buitelandse  Sake  nie  vinnig  genoeg  ander
reisreëlings kon tref nie. Die hotel  het  nou  geappelleer  uit  vrees  vir
teeneise - en hoe lank die kinders nou nog in aanhouding gaan bly, weet  ons
nie.

Buitelandse Sake probeer nou hulle bes, maar jongmense moet  gewaarsku  word
teen hierdie soort vergrype van menseregte, alvorens hulle  besluit  om  hul
horisonne te verbreed. Agente werf hulle en gee  nie  vir  hulle  die  feite
nie. Vir hierdie basiese menseregte sal ek en my party - en ek  weet  elkeen
in hierdie Raad ook - baklei. Hierdie is slegs een van talle voorbeelde  van
soortgelyke gevalle. Menseregte word nie oral ewe hoog aangeslaan nie.

So het ons 'n soortgelyke situasie in Zimbabwe.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, South  Africa  has  a  Constitution  which
offers an infrastructure in Chapter 9 to protect and extend  the  rights  of
individuals. But individual rights, however, is of little importance if  the
rights of the communities in which they reside are not also  protected.  The
Constitution of  South  Africa  does  this  as  well.  Section  185  of  the
Constitution, however, makes provision for the protection and  promotion  of
the rights of  linguistic,  cultural  and  religious  communities  and  this
commission should become a reality within a few  months.  The  advertisement
for the nomination of commissioners should appear next week. I am making  an
appeal  to  all  interested  parties  from  all  linguistic   and   cultural
communities to nominate people who can attend to the matter.

The Afrikaans communities  have  many  organisations  which  can  serve  the
community  in  this  domain,  but  this  is  lacking  in   many   indigenous
communities. The Afrikaans community is prepared to offer,  and  would  like
to offer, the privileged position in which it now  finds  itself  to  assist
the other communities  to  become  organised  in  this  domain.  One  should
remember that the Afrikaans community was in the  same  position  under  the
British occupation, as  many  of  the  indigenous  linguistic  and  cultural
communities now are, and grew from that. The  wheel  does  not  have  to  be
discovered again. Let us  work  together  in  the  linguistic  and  cultural
domain, which is a basic human right, and  make  South  Africa  work  for  a
better life for all its people.

That which we inherited from our forefathers, must not be trampled  upon  by
others or disregarded by ourselves.

The hon Kgoali referred to human rights  violations  in  South  Africa,  but
when we talk about this we should  also  look  at  the  treatment  of  South
Africans in other parts of the world. At the  beginning  of  last  year  two
young South  Africans  temporarily  worked  in  a  hotel  in  Dubai.  On  16
September 2002 they were accused of theft  and  imprisoned.  From  that  day
onwards I have been negotiating for their release. Time and again I  had  to
hear that we should rather let the process run its course because it is  not
a constitutional state, that there is no extradition  agreement  with  South
Africa and people's hands are still severed and  so  forth,  and  so  forth.
Don't stir, I was told.

On 25 February 2003 the case came up for hearing - five and  a  half  months
later, months in which they sat in prison without a hearing. The young  boys
were found to be innocent, but out of respect for the sheikh  to  which  the
hotel belongs and who accused them, they received a prison sentence  of  six
months, after which they would be deported. The deportation could  not  take
place, because the hotel kept their passports and Foreign Affairs could  not
arrange  other  travel  arrangements  quickly  enough.  The  hotel  has  now
appealed for fear of counter claims - and how long the children will now  be
held in detention, we do not know.

Foreign Affairs are now trying  their  best,  but  young  people  should  be
warned against these types of human rights violations before they decide  to
broaden their horizons. Agents recruit them but do not  give  them  all  the
facts. For these basic human rights my party and I - and I know everyone  in
this Council - will fight. This is merely one of many  examples  of  similar
cases. Human rights are not held in high esteem everywhere.
We have a similar situation in Zimbabwe.]

A 16-page document just compiled by the US State Department and launched  in
Washington  last  week,  blaming  Mugabe  and   his   government   for   the
humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, is being tabled.  It  states,  among  other
things, that Zimbabwe is in  crisis:  half  the  population  is  facing  the
threat of famine; up to 2 000 000 Zimbabweans have been  displaced;  80%  of
adults are unemployed; and  the  rule  of  law  has  been  replaced  by  the
arbitrary and brutal rule of a self-appointed elite.

Oppression and the denial of human  rights  have  gone  hand  in  hand  with
economic collapse. With inflation  running  at  200%,  food  production  has
declined by 85%  and  the  per  capita  income  by  50%.  With  the  economy
collapsing, there are 100 000 economic refugees a month, most  of  whom  are
coming to South Africa, at the rate of about 3 000 a  day  -  a  huge  extra
burden for South Africa.

The US State Department's paper is supported  by  the  research  of  Unicef,
which makes it clear that the main victims of these human rights abuses  are
women and children. They point  out  that  over  600  000  children  require
targeted nutrition initiatives,  nearly  a  million  children  do  not  have
access to safe water and sanitation, and 150 000 children are  in  desperate
need of protection from violence and abuse.

By riding roughshod over the  political  and  human  rights  of  his  fellow
Zimbabweans, by demonstrating his  total  disregard  for  human  rights  and
democracy, Mugabe has succeeded in reducing a once promising nation  with  a
bright future to a state of ruin.

But this will never happen in South Africa, for we have a Constitution  that
prevents it and we have leaders and a  society  that  wish  to  uphold  this
Constitution. But why are our leaders not shouting  it  out  from  each  and
every possible platform? This is the message that must  be  heard.  Let  us,
during the celebrations of Human Rights Day, celebrate the human rights  our
Constitution caters for. Let us strive to make it a reality  for  all  South
Africans, wherever they might be, but also for our neighbours in Africa.  We
have this responsibility and we should not try to escape it.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms D  M  RAMODIBE:  Hon  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  members,  as  we  prepare
ourselves to celebrate Human Rights Day on Friday, and  simultaneously  face
an imminent war between the United States and  Iraq,  it  seems  appropriate
that we reflect on our own struggle to ensure  that  peace  reigns  in  this
beautiful country of ours.

South Africa has, since its  first  democratic  elections  in  1994,  forged
unique pathways for the world to imitate and emulate. There can be no  doubt
that many prophets of doom  predicted  at  the  time  that  South  Africans,
having emerged from an oppressive past, would seek  retribution  from  those
architects of  many  atrocities  committed  against  them  during  the  dark
apartheid days, thanks to the ANC-led Government. Some South  Africans  even
bought into the predictions of a bloody revolution and, on the  strength  of
that belief, fled our country sure that chaos and anarchy would prevail.

South Africa not only proved on that day in  April  1994  that  we  had  the
political maturity to forgive  and  forget,  especially  after  having  gone
through the TRC,  but  also  expressed  the  rudiments  of  our  fundamental
confidence in  our  country  and  its  leadership.  We  instead  called  for
reconciliation. We understood at the time that we were the proud  owners  of
our country, in charge of our own destiny,  and  determined  that  we  would
never again allow anyone to deny us our basic human right to freedom in  the
land of our birth.

Our Constitution was our first building block along the  pathway  of  taking
back our human rights and restoring the dignity and humanity of mankind.  We
based our Constitution on the founding  principles  of  human  dignity,  the
achievement of equality and the advancement of  human  rights  and  freedom.
These  founding  principles  reverberate  throughout   the   text   of   our
Constitution and form the basis of the mammoth task of reconstruction  of  a
country almost destroyed by white oppression. We recognised  that  while  it
was a first step to have noble principles and ideals, we nonetheless  needed
to ensure that  all  our  people  had  institutions  that  would  strengthen
democracy, protect human rights and actively promote a culture  where  human
rights would flourish without despotic restrictions.

Chapter 9 of our  Constitution  fulfils  this  function.  These  independent
institutions - the  Public  protector;  the  Human  Rights  Commission;  the
Commission for the Promotion and  Protection  of  the  Rights  of  Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities; the Commission  for  Gender  Equality;
the Auditor-General;  and  the  Electoral  Commission  -  have  wide-ranging
responsibilities, not the least of which is the  promotion,  protection  and
monitoring of human rights.

These institutions are empowered, therefore, with mechanisms to  investigate
and resolve human rights violations in whatever shape or form  they  present
themselves. The mechanisms allow members of the public  or  institutions  to
lay a  complaint  about  any  public  institution  or  private  person.  The
complainant will thereafter have a justifiably reasonable  expectation  that
their  complaints  will  be  redressed  by   the   appropriate   Chapter   9
institution. In the same vein, all  of  these  Chapter  9  institutions  are
independent and all organs of state are  constitutionally  bound  to  assist
and protect these institutions to ensure their  independence,  impartiality,
dignity and effectiveness.

If we examine the aims of the Commission for Gender Equality, as set out  in
section 187 of the Constitution, which is to promote gender equality and  to
advise and make recommendations to Parliament or any other legislature  with
regard to any laws or proposed legislation  which  affects  gender  equality
and the status of women, we know  that  we  have  not  come  far  enough  in
changing the mindset of South Africans with regard  to  the  elimination  of
violence against women, the elderly and children. At the  workshop  held  on
the Justice for Women campaign in December last year,  the  Deputy  Minister
for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  Cheryl  Gillwald,  outlined,
amongst other  issues,  that  violence  in  the  workplace  is  not  getting
sufficient attention. So too, when one interviews  nurses,  doctors,  social
workers and battered women, the refrain is all  too  familiar  -  women  are
still subjected to the most horrific, abusive situations  imaginable.  These
abusers come from all walks of life: rich or poor, black or white and  urban
or rural.

It is unfortunate that the work of the Commission for  Gender  Equality  has
not spread to every part of our country, especially to the rural  areas  and
also the former homelands where there are amakhosi.  If  it  had,  hopefully
the number of abused women would have reduced drastically.  There  is  still
much work to be done by this  commission,  but  more  importantly  by  every
woman in this country. She needs to be aware that she has a right  to  bring
her problems to such a commission and expect results.
In the same way our Human Rights Commission is afforded the power ``to  take
steps to secure appropriate redress where human rights have been  violated''
- section 184(2)(b) of the Constitution. An example of the work done by  the
HRC arose in 2000, when a Muslim student at a  predominantly  white  college
placed an article on the notice board of the school  expressing  an  opinion
on the Palestinian and Israeli issue that differed from another  article  on
the same notice board.  She  was  suspended  from  school.  The  matter  was
settled through the intervention of the  HRC,  with  the  college  admitting
that the way it had  handled  the  incident  was  not  beyond  criticism  or
reproach, acknowledging that the conduct of certain of its  staff  had  been
inappropriate and apologising for the behaviour of one particular member  of
staff. The college agreed to work with the HRC in developing a programme  of
human rights training at the school.

Clearly, we are on the right path in dealing with the challenge of  building
and sustaining a human rights culture in South Africa. I have no doubt  that
with the appropriate resources, these Chapter 9 institutions  will  continue
to do, with a strength of purpose, that which the Constitution directs  them
to do, to strengthen our constitutional democracy. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, when dealing with  the  issue  of  human  rights,
specifically human rights in our country today, we need to  reflect  on  the
past, which the hon Minister has referred to, as well  as  the  vision  that
motivates our future.

Now, our past system was based on the philosophy that Parliament itself  was
sovereign, that what Parliament did was, by  definition,  right.  Parliament
could do no wrong. This draws  an  important  distinction  between  law  and
justice, because clearly what Parliament was doing in the past was  actually
enacting laws, but there was no concomitant requirement that the  laws  they
enacted should be just in any sense of the word.

This stands in stark contrast to the philosophy  which  we  all  adopted  in
negotiating our interim Constitution and our final  Constitution,  which  we
accepted and acknowledged: that there has to be some  sort  of  standard  of
what we would call, in philosophical  terms,  natural  justice  -  something
that must apply to all. By definition human rights apply to all  of  us.  We
are all human beings, and we all have these rights.

Now, this is  in  stark  contrast  to  the  philosophy  that  motivated  the
previous regime which we all lived under,  and  many  people  in  this  room
suffered under: the fact that laws, by definition, didn't need to  be  just.
I can only mention a few, but there are  many  laws  that  fall  into  these
categories: the laws  of  job  reservation,  the  laws  of  influx  control,
detention without trial. There are many of them. I think,  when  we  reflect
on Human Rights Day, we should reflect on these  issues  as  well,  and  not
forget what happened in the past.

But we should also not forget that we all look towards a brighter  future  -
a future based on the acknowledgement that we are all human beings, that  we
all  share  the  same  fundamental  rights,  and  that  these   rights,   by
definition, apply to everybody, whether the person in our country is  merely
a tourist or a visitor, or an economic refugee, or a political  refugee,  or
indeed a citizen. We all enjoy the same fundamental human rights.

There  have  been  problems  recently  relating  to  xenophobia  and   other
discrimination against various refugees, and I think we need to  acknowledge
that. As leaders in our community,  we  need  to  show  that  this  type  of
conduct is really at odds with our basic  philosophy,  the  philosophy  that
describes the foundation of our country.

These rights, applying to all, also apply vertically  and  horizontally,  as
they put it in technical terms. In  other  words  they  do  not  just  apply
between the citizens and the organs of state, but also between citizens  and
other private bodies. Just to give an  example  of  this:  If  a  restaurant
owner were to refuse to serve someone on the basis of their race  or  sexual
orientation, this clearly would not be acceptable to  our  society,  and  we
would not accept it.

In  our  Constitution  we  have  established  the  Chapter  9  institutions.
Although one doesn't wish to say in any way that one is more important  than
another, principal amongst them in the context of the present debate is  the
Human Rights Commission, which clearly has been charged with  ensuring  that
the rights we have  set  out  in  our  Constitution  achieve  fruition,  and
assisting us in achieving an equitable distribution  of  material  means  as
well, because rights can be meaningless if our society stays in a  state  of
pervasive poverty.

We have accepted this,  and  that  is  why  we  have  the  so-called  second
generation rights,  which  ensure  that  certain  health  services  will  be
provided to all, education will be provided to all, and food  security  will
also be established and provided  to  all.  But  as  ours  is  a  developing
country, obviously these things are difficult to provide. We cannot  wave  a
magic wand and ensure  that  they  are  there  overnight,  but  we  have  to
progressively ensure that these things are in fact delivered to the  people,
and the Human Rights Commission plays a role in this.

I have recently had a look through the fifth  annual  report  of  the  Human
Rights Commission, as well as their February newsletter. These appear to  be
the latest available  documents  on  them,  but  they  are  somewhat  dated,
because the fifth annual report deals with the period from January  2000  to
March 2001.

It is important to look at  what  the  commissioners  in  the  Human  Rights
Commission were saying to us, and I wish to highlight two quotes. The  first
one is on page 2 of the fifth annual report, where the commission states:


  We often wish that there was more debate and dialogue about  the  reports
  we have been publishing, more questions asked  in  Parliament,  and  more
  analysis and interpretation in terms of column inches in our newspapers.

So clearly the commissioners, at the time when they wrote that report,  felt
...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Hon  member,  your
speaking time has expired.

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M  J  BHENGU:  Sihlalo,  izolo  kusihlwa  ngike  ngathatha  incwadi  lena
ekhuluma  ngamalungelo  esintu.  Ngithole  isimanga  sokuthi   u-Article   1
ufundeka njengoba ngizosho: [Chairperson, yesterday in the evening I took  a
book on human rights. I was surprised  to  find  that  Article  1  reads  as
follows:]

  All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They  are
  endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another  in
  a spirit of brotherhood.

Our country prides herself on having a Constitution that  has  entrenched  a
Bill of Rights, which is a cornerstone of democracy in South  Africa,  based
on human dignity, equality and freedom. The Government of my country,  since
its inception in 1994, has put almost all the measures in place  to  redress
the inequalities of the past in terms of the equality clause.

Everyone has inherent dignity and the right  to  have  his  or  her  dignity
respected and protected. The central phrase here is ``human dignity":  ukuba
ngumuntu [being human].

The overarching aims of the  Constitution  are  closely  related  to  social
security goals - that is, healing  the  injustices  of  the  past,  ensuring
social justice, improving the quality of life for  all  South  Africans  and
freeing the potential of each citizen. The  meaning  of  the  constitutional
fundamental  rights  has  to  be  determined  and  understood  against   the
background of past human rights abuses.

Recently, in the North West province, we debated a lot  about  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty. To me this issue is  absolutely  central,  because
it is about something that poses a threat to  our  new  democracy.  When  we
talk about human dignity we need to be aware that poverty is  an  antithesis
of human dignity, in the sense that poverty dehumanises one and robs one  of
human dignity and integrity.

A closer  look  at  socioeconomic  conditions  amongst  our  people  reveals
shocking statistics. The recent revelation by Stats SA,  who  reported  that
32% of African households were jobless. In 1999, that percentage  had  risen
above 38. Translated into numbers, this suggested that there were about  1,9
million Africans who were without work.

Of approximately 210 000 African households, according to  Stats  SA,  about
182 000 spent on average less than R800 per month. About 11%  of  households
with children under seven went hungry in 1999 due to inability of  money  to
buy food. About 2,3 million households with  people  aged  seven  and  older
went hungry due to the inability to purchase food.

This is despite existing measures  to  address  the  various  dimensions  of
poverty. The reality is that, depending on the poverty line used,  about  20
million to 28 million citizens are  living  in  poverty.  The  incidence  of
poverty differs between different provinces. The Western  Cape  and  Gauteng
have the lowest rates of poverty. Mpumalanga,  the  Eastern  Cape,  KwaZulu-
Natal and the Northern Province are said to have high rates of poverty.

We all know that a key factor in South Africa is the skewed distribution  of
economic assets. Apartheid was central to this skewed ... [Time expired.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson,  I  enjoyed  very  much  the  Deputy  Minister's
excellent speech. On Friday, of course, we will celebrate Human Rights  Day.
We need to understand that as with all liberties, we in our  generation  and
in this Parliament have to defend and preserve  and  expand  those  freedoms
earned over centuries, often with the blood of patriots.

The 20th century has  been  one  of  the  most  bloody  centuries  in  human
history. Over the last century more people have been enslaved  in  the  name
of human rights than ever before  in  world  history,  and  this  makes  our
achievement that much greater. Eastern and Central  Europe,  the  Far  East,
Central America and Africa are  littered  with  former  communist  countries
with high-flown constitutions that have failed their people.

Societies and revolutions need to be judged, ultimately,  by  their  fruits.
We have seen incredible convulsions in the 20th century: China of the  Great
Helmsman, Kim II Sung's  Korea,  Vietnam's  Uncle  Ho,  Cuba  under  Castro,
Ethiopia under Mengistu and Angola under Neto. We have seen not only  crimes
against humanity but crimes against national  and  universal  culture,  from
Stalin's destruction of thousands of churches in  Moscow  and  elsewhere  to
the literary and artistic devastation of Mao's Red Guards.

The Black Book of Communism, which I have  here,  is  written  by  the  most
distinguished authors of their kind in the world. I can quote from  The  New
York Times, which says:


  No one will any longer be able to claim ignorance  or  uncertainty  about
  the criminal nature of communism, and those who have begun to forget will
  be forced to remember anew.

I recommend this to all of my colleagues.

The death toll in the Soviet Union is 25 million, 65 million in  China,  1,7
million in Cambodia. Wherever Communism  was  established,  usually  in  the
name of freedom and human rights, some terror and  repression  followed.  So
it is not only what we in South Africa say, or what our  Constitution  says,
but what we do in our country that is important.  In  our  country  we  have
sought constitutional government. The Constitution is our highest  law,  and
thank God for that, and we in this Parliament are sworn to uphold that law.

We must never for one moment forget to appreciate the  huge  achievement  of
our country to date, and we must jealously guard against  any  retreat  from
the heights we have attained. Indeed, the past decade or so has  seen  South
Africa at its best and noblest. We have elevated our  society.  People  will
look back upon this time with pride.  Indeed,  many  people  still  in  this
Parliament today will be seen as the founding fathers in  the  establishment
of a great new future in our country.

But we need to continue to foster a culture of  human  rights,  and  at  the
heart of this is respect for life, for liberty and for property. The way  in
which we interpret our Constitution remains vital. In the name of the  right
to life we condone, allow and promote abortion, with an  estimated  285  000
babies killed by abortion  on  demand  over  the  past  six  years.  What  a
brutalisation of society! It is a massive brutalisation.

Since the abolition of the death penalty  in  1989,  250  000  murders  have
occurred in our country. In the past week five innocent children  have  been
killed in the crossfire. But both abortion and the abolition  of  the  death
penalty have been argued in the  name  of  human  rights.  The  scales  have
tipped in favour of the criminal. Where there is  lack  of  morality,  human
rights will suffer.

We lose the moral high ground when we claim for ourselves human  rights  but
condone, or do not speak out against, the actions  of  despots  like  Robert
Mugabe. Our attitude to the grotesque violations of  human  rights  in  that
country makes a mockery of the peer review process  of  Nepad  and  devalues
our own commitment to human rights.

However, I am proud of what our country has  achieved  constitutionally  and
in the field of human rights. I am proud of our leaders  who  have  inspired
us over the past decade. I am proud of  the  ordinary  South  Africans  that
have allowed our country to be great and supported the process. I  am  proud
of this great parliamentary institution and of our right and duty to  defend
those liberties.

Let us in our generation rededicate ourselves to the great values  of  human
rights that have been a product of the reformation. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, it's so wonderful to listen to people  like
Kent Durr talking about Zimbabwe and so  on  and  about  the  violations  of
human rights there. I thought maybe he was going  to  start  here  at  home.
It's nice to condemn other countries who are said to be  communists  and  so
on. I thought he would mention Israel, to start with, and from there  go  on
to mention America - their friends.
There is no way in which we can ignore what is happening in Israel and  say,
simply because they are our friends, that what they are doing  is  good.  If
there  is  any  violation  of  human  rights  one  can  speak  of,  one  can
immediately think of Israel. They are there in our own country.

Of course, I was so disappointed, listening to the colleague whom I  respect
so much, the  hon  Van  Niekerk,  talking  about  Zimbabwe  and  so  on  and
condemning  our  Government  for  not  coming  out  clearly  and  condemning
Zimbabwe.

It depends on whether one  understands  our  policy  as  a  Government.  The
policy is to engage, to talk to your colleagues or  other  governments.  You
don't solve problems by just condemning and making a  noise.  You  can't  do
that. We are supposed to start here at home  and  ask  ourselves  if  it  is
right for our people to be denied those few  basic  rights  such  as  having
clean water.

They are good enough to work on those farms, but  at  the  same  time,  when
they want clean water they are asked to go and draw it  from  the  river.  I
can't overlook that and look at Zimbabwe while our people here at  home  are
harassed. I agree that there are other things which are  done,  for  example
things mentioned by the hon Van Niekerk such  as  the  South  Africans  ill-
treated in Dubai.

I thought we would start from our corner here in  the  Northern  Cape  where
two young boys were denied the right just to  pass  through  a  sportsfield,
because it happened to be a place where some of  their  fellow  young  boys,
who happened to be white, were practising rugby. It  was  before  the  match
had started. So those poor guys were passing through.  It  was  an  offence.
They were beaten. I thought that was  where  we  would  start,  if  we  were
serious about these things.

I want to correct some people who are distorting  our  history.  Forty-three
years ago, our leaders said that enough was enough, and  it  could  be  more
than enough in the case of the pass laws. They mobilised our  people  to  do
what we call in our language: Kgwabo ka seboka [mass demonstration].

Ba ile ba lokisa gore ba ye go gwanta, ba gwaba gore  ba  lapisitswe  ke  go
sika le di-dompas. Ge ba le gare ba huahuetsa gore  setshaba  se  tsoge  ...
[They prepared themselves for a march to demonstrate  that  they  were  sick
and tired of carrying the dompas. As they were busy appealing to the  nation
to wake up ...]

... in the four so-called regions before -  Transvaal,  Natal,  Orange  Free
State and the Cape ...

... ge ba thoma go kgobokantsha batho, baetapele ba rena - ba ANC -  ba  ile
ba swarwa. Ge ba  se  no  swarwa  pele  ga  ge  ba  phethagatsa  seo  ba  se
thomilego, go ile gwa tla batho ba bangwe gomme ba  kgelosetsa  lenaneo  leo
lemanogeng le le sele. [... as they were  busy  arranging  mass  gatherings,
our leaders - the ANC leadership - were arrested. Since they  were  arrested
before they  could  implement  what  they  have  started,  there  came  some
opportunists who led our people into a completely different direction.]

I am talking about the Sharpeville of 1960. The whole process  was  hijacked
because our leaders were arrested then. Some people  said  that  that  march
had been organised by the PAC. That is not true. History must be  set  down,
because  people  are  distorting  it.  That  demonstration  and  march   was
organised by the ANC. But  before  they  could  implement  that,  they  were
arrested - our leaders. Therefore, Sobukwe  and  the  others,  because  they
were outside and were running around, hijacked that process.  That  must  be
told in clear terms. I thought that I had to clarify that one.

Where do we come from?

Bana bana ba rena le lehono ga ba dumele gore go bile le  nako  yeo  e  lego

[Today, our children do not believe us when we  tell  them  that  there  had
been times in our country when it was an offence for a black person  to  buy
liquor for himself. Our children do not believe us when we  tell  them  that
there had been times in our country when it  was  an  offence  for  a  black
person to bathe in a swimming pool or swim at a beach which was meant to  be
used by whites only. Our children do not believe us when we tell  them  that
there had been times in our country when it  was  an  offence  for  a  black
person to relax in a park that was meant to be  used  by  whites  only.  Our
children do not believe us when we tell them that there had  been  times  in
our country when it was an offence for a black person to  put  on  a  jersey
similar to the one used by a national team of his or her country.]

Our rugby player Tobias was denied a  chance  to  wear  the  jersey  of  the
national squad because he happened not to be of the other colour.  When  our
kids hear about some of these things, they do not believe that that used  to
happen.

O ka se dumele gore e be e le molato  gore  mothomoso  a  namele  terene  go
First Class ka tshelete ya gagwe. Bana ba rena ga ba dumele  tseo  ka  moka.
[Our children do not believe us when we tell them that there had been  times
in our country when it was an offence for a black  person  to  buy  a  first
class train ticket with his or her own money.]

But it is true. In this very Parliament, when a coloured person used a  lift
and it happened that a white person entered that lift,  that  poor  coloured
person was supposed to get out of the lift to  allow  the  white  person  to
come in. He could only use the lift when the white person  was  out  of  it.
That used to happen in this very Parliament. When our kids  hear  all  these
things, they think it's just a story, but it's a fact. It is  where  we  are
supposed to start if we are really concerned about the  violation  of  human
rights in this country, rather than jumping to Colombia or wherever. Let  us
start here.

My colleague the hon Kgoali reminds me that it was an offence even to use  a
mere toilet used by whites. If you were  caught  using  one,  you  would  be
heavily punished. As a country we have moved on.

Re tswile go lekgoba leo gomme bjale re batho. [We are now  free  from  that
slavery, and today we are human beings.]

We are happy because our fellow South Africans and our  white  brothers  and
sisters agree that what happened in the past was wrong and  that  we  should
move forward. They agree, but at the same time there are few, very few ...

... bao e lego gore ba sa ganelela go tsa kua morago [... of those  who  are
still yearning for the past.]
It is up to us as patriotic South Africans and those  who  know  where  they
are going to take them along with us. Some will be  kicking  and  screaming,
but let's drag them along. We will get somewhere with them.  Let's  not  get
tired.

A re yeng le bona. [Let's go with them.]

I know that it's not easy, but one day we will get there with them.

Re a leboga ka gore bjale Molaotheo wa rena o  re  dumelela  gore  tseo  tsa

(Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[We are thankful that our Bill provides that the past  has  gone,  and  gone
forever. They were unjust. Let us go forward and work like  people.  We  ask
all those who want to go forward with us to hold  hands  and  say  the  past
belongs to the past. We will greatly rejoice if ...]

... in this House, we are all going  to  say:  Yes,  it's  true,  enough  is
enough and we can't  take  more  than  enough.  We've  had  enough  of  what
happened in the past and now we are ready to go forward.

Ke a leboga. [Legofsi.] [Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,
Chair. I hope you'll be patient with me. I've got little bits of  paper  all
over the place and  I  also  have  to  try  and  decipher  my  own  terrible
handwriting because I furiously made notes  during  this  process,  and  I'm
afraid I didn't do a very good job. I'm much better with a keyboard  than  a
pen.

We are all so aware of how race, class and  gender  conspire  to  place  the
African rural woman at the very bottom of the human  rights  hierarchy.  The
hon member Kgoali's many inputs chronicled  the  dire  conditions  that  our
people, especially in the  rural  areas,  continue  to  experience.  And  we
should  never  forget  about  that  intersectionality   of   human   rights,
particularly for those of us who have the privilege of jobs,  the  privilege
of a past society where we  benefited  from  an  education  that  was  given
freely, with every mod con. We should never forget  that  intersectionality;
that poverty, race, class and gender  put  people  at  the  bottom  of  this
hierarchy and make them incredibly vulnerable to the vagaries of  modern-day
society.

And then there were the hurts that were described about having  to  leave  a
lift. I was very embarrassed recently. I wandered away from the NEC  meeting
in Gauteng with a black colleague during lunch time and we  went  to  get  a
cooldrink. We walked into a cafe together and, by virtue of the way  we  had
to walk in, he actually came to the counter first, and  so  I  stood  aside.
The man actually just looked at him and then looked at me and said: ``Can  I
help you?'' And it was a complete annihilation of  the  man's  dignity.  The
man that I was with was perfectly able to defend his own rights, but it  was
just automatic. In fact, what was perhaps more damaging is that  the  person
serving had no malevolent intent; they weren't even aware of the  pain  they
were causing.

So we need to  remember  that  very  often  very  small  actions  can  cause
enormous pain, and again I'd like to refer to our children. It is  something
else when you infringe upon an adult's rights because they at least  have  a
way of defending, but children  often  start  to  believe  that  they  don't
deserve those rights, and you then start a whole  thing  of  insecurity  and
also a lack of certainty about one's own rights. So I think we  need  to  be
particularly careful with one another and one another's children. And  since
our children now in this new society do meet in our schools, it's  an  ideal
opportunity to show them that we have faith  in  the  future.  I  will  move
along a bit; I'm dragging it out.

Language rights referred to by the hon  Van  Niekerk  is  a  very  important
issue and here, as a language-disabled person, I would like to  congratulate
this House on the many attempts by members to make their languages heard  by
the people who listen to this on television.  I  think  you  all  deserve  a
round of applause. It is a conscious effort and  I  think  you  do  it  very
well. [Applause.]

I do agree with the hon Van  Niekerk,  but  perhaps  our  young  people  are
becoming a little complacent about  their  rights,  particularly  when  they
travel. And I might just say to you that I have a lawyer  friend  who  might
guide us in this process. He will not travel  -  and  he  is  a  very  well-
travelled person - to any other country that  has  the  death  penalty,  his
view being that while he's alive he can still defend himself, but when  he's
dead he can't, and so he will not visit any legal jurisdiction that has  the
death penalty. And this is  something  we  assume  as  a  right  and  as  an
appropriate thing,  so  we  very  often,  I  think,  don't  realise  what  a
wonderful Constitution we have.

The hon Ramodibe highlighted the roles of our  Chapter  9  institutions  and
the need to improve their reach in the rural areas. Now  here  I  think  the
NCOP has an important role to play because I  know  that  the  Human  Rights
Commission has regional offices, so do the gender commissions, and  I  think
that we must encourage our constituents, our Government agencies  to  liaise
very strongly in the regions with those  institutions  that  are  regionally
represented. I think also, importantly, Parliament  should  explore  how  it
enhances the relationship between the  HRC  and  other  commissions  because
these commissions are required to report to the  National  Assembly  in  our
Constitution. There was a reference by the hon Lever to how  the  HRC  would
love to have their reports debated and maybe  what  we  are  doing  is  just
looking at their reports and filing them. We have a lot of work to  do,  but
maybe we need to review that and maybe a very good place to  start  is  with
the annual reports of the various commissions that  report  to  this  august
institution.

The hon Lever also described very well the dilemma we face  as  an  emerging
economy, where the needs of our people are so great  that  we  have  had  to
take  a  very  painful  decision  that  our  delivery  programmes  will   be
sustainable and that they will be  incremental,  and  it's  to  achieve  the
balance between maximising the  reach  of  our  delivery  services  and  the
realisation of people's rights  through  concerted  efforts  and  then  also
within a framework of sustainability. So we are all  agreed  it  is  a  huge
challenge and we need to find the common ground that takes us forward.

With regard to the hon Bhengu, I really thought  that  his  observation  was
very astute  that  poverty  is  the  antithesis  of  dignity.  I  think  you
sometimes get little groups of small words that actually say a lot and  it's
something that I will use again when I am trying to describe how people  who
live in abject poverty are robbed of their humanity and dignity.

Also, I think the other thing is that  because  we  are  so  busy  educating
ourselves in constitutional democracy and educating others, and  because  we
are  politicians,  we  very  often  use  the  same   words:   constitutional
democracy, human dignity. We must be sure that when we  use  them  we  don't
dilute their importance. We must always speak to  the  importance  of  those
key phrases that capture the heart and soul of our Constitution.  Let's  not
dilute their value by not giving them meaning.

The hon Durr referred to enslavement, and modern slavery has  a  very  nasty
face. Women and children are traded across international borders  the  world
over. I had the privilege  to  spend  some  time  with  the  prosecutor  for
organised crime. That was the first institution that was  set  up  to  fight
organised crime in Italy, the Mafia.  Now  of  course  they  have  the  Cosa
Nostra, and then the Albanian Mafia and it goes  on  and  on,  because  they
have very different characteristics. And he said to me, in almost a  matter-
of-fact way, `` Drugs are now becoming a secondary problem for  us''.  So  I
said, ``What do you mean?'' He said, ``Well, humans  and  human  body  parts
are far  more  valuable  than  drugs.''  He  described  incidents  in  which
Nigerian women had been lured to Italy with promises of  work  and  enslaved
for sex for years before the Italian anti-Mafia unit cracked  the  syndicate
and released them and gave them back their passports and let  them  go  back
home.

Also, there is the horrible story of finding street children, who  are  poor
and  have  no  reference  points,  walking  around  dazed  from  very  crude
anaesthetics, and when the police find them one of their kidneys is  missing
or something because there is a  very  good  market.  So,  slavery  has  new
implications and an impact  on  women  and  children.  I  would  urge  those
committees that are related to make  sure  that  this  Parliament  gets  its
legislation on the trade in humans sorted out as soon as we can.

Having made that very astute observation, Mr Durr's  comments  on  communism
will remain unchallenged because I would need more than an afternoon to  re-
educate him. So, Mr Durr, if you will take that as a  friendly  offer,  that
we will one day ...

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Oh,  that
book isn't the sole authority.

On women's rights to control their own bodies, I will take issue. You,  sir,
by virtue of your gender and your simplistic political and  gender  analysis
are excused for what  must  be  a  real  lack  of  understanding  about  the
oppression of women, because I am certain that you do not want  to  be  part
of the perpetuation of this oppression. And  I  urge  you  to  rethink  your
stance on this. The cost to women annually is devastating.

Hon Mokoena always describes very succinctly the challenges that face us  as
a society and as individuals, and I think that one thing  that  we  need  to
do, because this is a debate about South Africa and our own  rights,  is  to
look at some of the other places that have real problems. And  let  us  just
look at Palestine: 762 000 refugees with  no  chance  to  return,  destroyed
homes, children dying in the street. So I think that we need to reaffirm  as
South Africans our commitment to human rights, but I think we also  need  to
say: ``How  do  we  become  advocates  of  human  rights  internationally?''
Because it is very easy to be self-focusing in the dire straits in which  we
sometimes find ourselves. But I think that we have a role  to  play  because
we have models that work. And I think  people  are  honestly  curious  about
using our mechanisms.
I then would like just to tell you about a small  thing  we  have  done.  In
fact, it's actually a big deal, so I won't minimise it in any way.  We  have
set up a new directorate which deals with Chapter 9s. Their  most  important
functions are to facilitate the budgetary  process  in  assisting  financial
arrangements because, you know, with this  independence  thing  one  doesn't
want to put too many limitations on them having to  bargain  and  plead  for
money. So we think that this is an important thing.  Their  second  function
is promoting proposals that emanate from these  institutions'  reports,  and
this is very important so that once they make proposals the message is  sent
out and people are educated about that.  Other  functions  include  ensuring
compliance with the Constitution, evaluating and assessing  the  legislation
and promoting  and  maintaining  communication  channels  between  the  nine
institutions and state departments. It's an exploration of  how  we  enhance
the capacity of these institutions without interfering  with  their  central
integrity.

I'd also like to tell you that Adv Barrington Mkhize, who is  head  of  that
directorate, is here with us today and I suggest you touch  base  with  him.
He has an enormous challenge. Partly one of the things he has to do will  be
a bit of a voyage of discovery,  because  he  will  have  to  make  his  job
meaningful. So to a large extent we've described the tasks, but  he's  going
to give meaning to how we enhance the  role  that  these  institutions  play
without limiting the extraordinary potential that they have. I think ...

Mr A E VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson.  Sorry,  may  I  please  ask  the  Deputy
Minister a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Well, it  will  depend
on the Deputy Minister whether she wants to take a question. Do you want  to
take a question, hon Deputy Minister?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  I'll  take
the question, but I don't know much more about the unit, so  if  it's  about
that ... OK.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: The question is merely: With regard to the  directorate,
are they going to look at incorporating PanSALB as an independent  organ  as
well in the Chapter 9 context?

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: I will  tell
you quite honestly that I do not know, but do  ask  the  gentleman  whom  we
have tasked with the efforts that I described. I'm sure  he'll  be  able  to
assist. Sorry I can't help you.

And finally, thank you for listening to me blather on for such a long  time,
but it was a really good debate and once again I  enjoyed  participating  in
this House. Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

    THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE NATIONAL
                            COUNCIL OF PROVINCES

                          (Subject for Discussion)
Mrs C NKUNA: Eka  Mutshami  wa  Xitulu  wa  siku  ra  namuntlha,  ni  le  ka
vachaviseki hinkwenu laha ndlwini inkomu [Chairperson  and  hon  members  of
this House], it is indeed an honour for me to participate in this debate  on
oversight and accountability.

I think it  would  be  appropriate  for  someone  to  explain  briefly  what
oversight is. ``Oversight'' refers to the crucial role  of  legislatures  in
monitoring  and  reviewing  actions  of  the  executive  organs  of   state.
``Accountability'' refers to giving an account of actions  on  policies  for
spending, explaining and justifying against criteria of some kind.  We  take
measures or make  amendments  so  as  to  make  a  point  of  ensuring  that
particular faults or errors do not occur  again,  and  we  ensure  that  the
executive implement laws in the way required  by  the  legislature  and  the
demands of the Constitution.

We recommitted ourselves, at our 51st national conference  in  Stellenbosch,
to  transforming  the  state  and  governance,   and   in   particular   the
legislatures,  meaning  nationally  and  provincially,  as   well   as   the
municipalities at local level, with the objective of improving  our  ability
to monitor and assess  the  performance  of  Government  departments,  state
agencies, etc.

The principal role of this House is to  ensure  that  provincial  and  local
concerns are recognised at the national policy-making  level.  The  role  of
the National Council of Provinces in terms of oversight is provided  for  by
section 100. The provision in this section empowers this House  to  table  a
notice which provides for the intervention by the national executive in  any
province which has failed to fulfil an  executive  obligation  in  terms  of
legislation or the Constitution in any of  the  nine  provinces.  Similarly,
section 139 provides for intervention in municipalities which is of  a  more
intense and focused nature.

Now I come to  Chapter  3  of  the  Constitution,  which  provides  for  co-
operative governance whereby the three spheres of government are obliged  to
adhere to its principles - that is, the  principles  of  Chapter  3  in  the
Constitution. Section 41 compels all spheres to secure the wellbeing of  all
the people of South Africa.

The oversight role played by the NCOP in the  Constitution  is  twofold.  In
the Constitution we have sections in  terms  of  which  the  NCOP  plays  an
oversight on its own. Also in the Constitution we have sections in terms  of
which the NCOP plays its oversight role together or in partnership with  the
National Assembly. The NCOP has to guard against the abuse  of  the  various
powers  of  intervention.  For  example,  where   the   national   executive
intervenes in a province under  section  100,  it  is  the  NCOP  that  must
approve of and regularly review the intervention.

Where the provincial executive intervenes in a  municipality  under  section
139(1)(b), it is also the NCOP that has to make a  point  of  approving  and
regularly reviewing  the  intervention.  In  a  situation  where  there  are
administrative disputes, it is the NCOP which must make a review,  and  that
is provided for by section 125(4) of the Constitution. Section 216  provides
for both Houses to stop a transfer of funds to a  province.  Section  146(2)
says that a piece of delegated legislation cannot prevail over another law.

It is the NCOP that monitors  the  effectiveness  of  the  intergovernmental
relations mechanisms in any field. Well, as I said  earlier  on,  there  are
those areas where the NCOP practises its oversight role in partnership  with
the NA. Section 199(8) deals with the security services, for  instance,  and
we find that though the security services are a  core  national  competence,
we  do  have  committees  and  MECs  at  provincial  level,  but  they   are
accountable to the national Ministry.

Cases where an international agreement has to be approved are  provided  for
by section  231,  in  terms  of  which  both  Houses  are  responsible,  and
according to section 203 the declaration of a state of  a  national  defence
is also done by both Houses.

When it comes to public participation, we will all remember that  two  weeks
back we were in  the  provinces  dealing  with  the  third  and  the  fourth
constitutional amendments, and with the Powers and Immunities of  Parliament
Bill. All that was done in the nine provinces simultaneously and we took  on
board the stakeholders on the ground.

Allow  me  to  now  come  to  the  division   of   revenue   and   oversight
responsibility of the  NCOP.  The  allocation  of  resources  to  the  three
spheres of government is  recognised  as  a  critical  step  in  the  budget
process. It is essential for national Government,  the  nine  provinces  and
each of the 284 municipalities to be able to determine their own budget.  On
Wednesday 12 March 2003, the national Department of  Education  submitted  a
comprehensive report on conditional grants to the public hearings hosted  by
the Select Committee on Finance in the National Council of Provinces.

The department reported that by 31 January 2003 Limpopo province  had  spent
36,9% and the Eastern Cape 35% of their  financial  management  and  quality
enhancement conditional grants. The Education  department  argued  that  the
fact that provinces had not spent much of their  allocated  funds  indicated
that procurement procedures and payment processes  hindered  expenditure  in
their provinces. The department  also  explained  that  despite  the  under-
expenditure, the overall level of expenditure  showed  an  improvement  over
time. The Education department also reported that provinces on  average  had
spent 61% of their HIV and Aids grants in the financial  year  ending  March
2002. The Education department has withheld the transfer of funds until  our
provinces can give reasons for the low expenditure.

During the same public hearings the national  Department  of  Health  argued
that provinces spent 43,1% of their HIV  and  Aids  grants.  Four  provinces
have significantly  underspent  and  additional  funds  have  been  targeted
towards provinces with a stronger spending  performance.  So  the  more  you
spend, the more you will be given; the less you spend,  the  more  you  will
suffer. This voluminous underspending is cause for concern to us  as  public
representatives, and we need to determine how we can intervene.

Members  of  the  provincial  legislatures  and  the  National  Council   of
Provinces are earnestly requested to play a more active and  vital  role  in
monitoring spending by provincial departments.  If  discrepancies  exist  in
provincial financial reporting, it is  likely  that  discrepancies  will  be
revealed on delivery  as  well.  Moreover,  MPLs  and  NCOP  members  should
exercise extraordinary vigilance in order to monitor the  spending  patterns
of conditional grants to provincial departments.

In conclusion, on oversight and accountability, let me start by saying  that
oversight is something  which  we  have  to  appreciate  and  look  at  very
positively, and not take  as  some  witch-hunting  mechanism.  Oversight  is
something which we  have  to  debate  and  talk  about  as  members  of  the
legislatures and as  the  stakeholders.  We  have  to  debate  it  with  the
nongovernmental  organisations  that  play  a  role  in   exercising   their
oversight and discuss or talk about it with Chapter 9 institutions. Then  we
will be moving towards a situation where we can truly  say,  ``This  is  the
people's Parliament'', and  ``The  people  are  governing''.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the hon Nkuna has given  a  comprehensive  speech
on the matter of oversight. I am going  to  highlight  certain  issues.  The
first is that  I  think  little  is  served,  to  start  off,  by  examining
mechanical definitions of  the  term  ``oversight''  or  ``accountability''.
They are, in essence, different sides of  the  same  coin.  It  serves  more
purpose to look at the structure  of  our  Government  as  set  out  in  the
Constitution and at what we, as a House of Parliament, are  required  to  do
by the Constitution.

Oversight and accountability form part of the covenant that  we,  as  public
representatives, have with the voters  because  they  comprise  one  of  the
important checks and balances that exist in our political  system.  We  have
an executive, the  legislative  arm  of  Government,  the  judicial  arm  of
Government and, of course, the administrative arm and  Public  Service.  The
Constitution requires us, as part of the legislative arm of  Government,  to
have oversight over the executive and to  hold  the  executive  to  account.
This does not mean that we can say, ``Well, it should be done in  this  area
or that area.'' It is quite broadly based.

We have a very strong, in  fact  a  very  good  and  progressive,  piece  of
legislation  in  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  which,  as  far  as
financial accountability goes, is an excellent piece of legislation. But  we
need to look at  sections  55(2),  92(2),  92(3)(b),  100  and  139  of  the
Constitution when examining oversight, specifically in regard to one of  the
Houses of Parliament. Section 55(2) essentially deals  with  the  obligation
that the National Assembly has in respect of oversight  and  the  mechanisms
that they must put in place to give effect to their duty to  have  oversight
and hold the executive to account.

However, if we look at the Corder report, which is based on a  lot  of  work
that was done in examining the roles that  the  different  Houses  play,  we
find that it saw a very narrow role for the National  Council  of  Provinces
in oversight: In other words, that it should restrict  itself  only  to  its
principal focus  of  looking  at  national  Government's  implementation  of
legislation and policy that impacts  on  and  affects  provinces  and  local
government.

For a very long time we had a  joint  committee  of  both  Houses  where  we
examined the Corder report. All of us  discussing  the  chapter  that  dealt
with the National Council of Provinces felt that that narrow  view  was  not
really justified.  There  were  a  number  of  reasons  for  that.  I  would
recommend that all members of this  House  read  that  report,  specifically
chapter 4. I would specifically refer to the deliberations of the  committee
and our recommendations, which are set out on pages 35 to 37.

I am not going to read them out, but  I  think  that  we  did  set  out  our
reasons for saying that it is somehow artificial to simply say  to  us  that
we need to  have  only  a  narrow  focus  in  oversight,  because  oversight
encompasses a number of things. One cannot be blind  to  something,  have  a
blinkered view and look at something when clearly you can see an  obligation
and perhaps a duty to do something in another area  which  simply  overlaps.
As the hon Chief Whip pointed out to us, duplication in oversight  does  not
necessarily translate into duplication in corrective action.  Hand  in  hand
with this duty and obligation of oversight is also a duty and obligation  to
correct issues where something has gone wrong.

So what the hon Chief Whip said in our deliberations  which  is  encompassed
in the report is that even if both  Houses  are  doing  the  same  thing  in
oversight, it doesn't mean that  there  would  be  two  different  types  of
corrective action. I think, in essence, what was  contemplated  by  the  hon
Chief Whip and the committee was that we should  co-ordinate  our  oversight
function between the committees of the two  respective  Houses.  That  isn't
simply to say that we should restrict one House or the other. It  is  simply
to say that we need to be talking to the committees in the  other  House  so
that we  can  both  have  a  sense  of  the  complete  picture,  fulfil  our
constitutional obligations in oversight and hold the  executive  to  account
where that is required and constitutionally valid.

There is only one other minor point that I wish to mention and that is  that
section 231 of the Constitution gives  the  National  Council  of  Provinces
oversight in regard to international treaties and agreements.  In  terms  of
our internal Rules these are voted on by the provinces. But the  issue  here
is that this is an  artificial  situation  because  the  provinces  are  not
consulted, nor are they briefed on  international  treaties  or  agreements.
This, clearly, is somehow a misconception of the role that  provinces  would
play and the role that we would, in fact, play. I think that it's  one  area
where we should look at our own Rules and see whether that is not  something
that we  can  correct  so  that  we  can  properly  exercise  our  oversight
function.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Sihlalo, isihloko  esikhuluma  ngaso  namhlanje  siqondene
nokubaluleka  kokwethembeka,  ukuba  neso  lokhozi   -   iso   eliqaphelayo,
nokubamba iqhaza emsebenzini  esiwenzayo  ngobuqotho.  UmKhandlu  kaZwelonke
weziFundazwe  ubaluleke  kakhulu   kuHulumeni   omkhulu   ngoba   uxhumanisa
uHulumeni omkhulu wezwe nezifundazwe eziyisishiyagalolunye.  Ilungu  nelungu
elilapha kule Ndlu likhethwe  nguhulumeni  wesifundazwe  ngokulethemba.  Uma
lethembekile kuyohamba  kahle  konke  ukuxhumana  kukaHulumeni  nesifundazwe
leso nasemisebenzini yonke yomphakathi.

Omunye  umsebenzi  omkhulu  wale  Ndlu  ukuba  neso   lokhozi   ekubhekeleni
uHulumeni ukuthi  imali  ayikhiphile  isebenza  ngakho  yini  ezifundazweni.
UmKhandlu  kaZwelonke  weziFundazwe  uyazihambela  izifundazwe   futhi   uba
nohlelo  olugcwele  lokucubungula  isimo  esidingekayo.  Kumanje   nje   iso
elibanzi lomKhandlu kaZwelonke weziFundazwe ukubheka ukuthi ukulwa  nendlala
nokuthuthukisa  imiphakathi  kulandelwa  kahle  yini   ngokulandela   uhlelo
lukaMongameli wezwe. Ngabe kuhanjiswa ngendlela yini?  Akukho  ukuxhaphazeka
kwemali? Bukhona ubuqotho? Kukhona ukwethembeka kule mali  esisebenza  kuyo,
nokunye nokunye?

Kumanje  nje  umKhandlu  kaZwelonke  weziFundazwe   usuhambele   izifundazwe
ezimbili   eMtata   -   eMpumalanga   Koloni,   naseMafikeng   -   eNyakatho
Ntshonalanga. Yilawo mathuba  okuxhumanisa  umphakathi  nale  Ndlu  ezingeni
elithe  xaxa.  Umphakathi  ubeka  izidingo  zawo   emkhandlwini   kazwelonke
kuphinde futhi kuvele ithuba lokuhambahamba  kubonwa  intuthuko  yomphakathi
noma izidingo ezikhona emphakathini nokunye nokunye.

Sibonile  uHulumeni  ekhipha  imali  eyinikeza  izifundazwe  kugcine   lapho
kungabonakali futhi  kungezwakali  ukuthi  imali  ishonephi.  Kafishane  nje
lokho kuyisithombe sokungethembeki emsebenzini  umuntu  asuke  ebekwe  kuwo.
Angikhulumi lapha ngomuntu osebenzayo  noma  ovilaphayo  nohwiphilita  imali
esuke ikhishwe  uHulumeni.  Nalaba  abasezingeni  eliphezulu  bayangena  shi

Iso  elibanzi  kudingeka  ligxile  emthethweni  oshayiwe,  imali   ekhishiwe
yezidingo, ukusebenza komthetho ezifundazweni, ukuthi intuthuko ikhona  yini
nokudingekayo ukuletha intuthuko emphakathini. Konke  lokho  kudinga  umuntu
owaziyo umsebenzi, ukuthembeka nobuqotho, ukumela izimo nokulwela  uHulumeni
kuyo iminyango esifundazweni sonke jikelele  kusukela  kuhulumeni  wesifunda
kuze  kowasekhaya  kanjalo  kanjalo.  Ngiyabonga.  (Translation  of  isiZulu
speech follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, today's topic is  about  the  importance  of
honesty, farsightedness and  diligence  in  doing  our  work.  The  National
Council of Provinces is crucial to the Government because it forms the  link
between the national Government and  the  nine  provinces.  Each  and  every
member who is in this House has been  elected  by  a  provincial  government
because they trust him or her. If he  or  she  is  trustworthy  the  liaison
between the Government and that particular province  will  go  smoothly  and
all community projects run well.

Another major task of this House is to monitor whether  the  money  that  is
allocated by the Government to provinces is  properly  spent.  The  National
Council of Provinces visits provinces and  it  also  has  a  full  programme
which is aimed at assessing needs. At the  moment  the  main  focus  of  the
National  Council  of  Provinces  is   on   scrutinising   whether   poverty
alleviation and community development are properly  executed  in  accordance
with the plans of the President. Is everything done  accordingly?  Is  money
not being squandered? Is there honesty? Is there  trustworthiness  regarding
the money for which we are responsible, etc?

Up until now, the National Council of Provinces has visited  two  provinces,
ie Umtata in the  Eastern  Cape  and  Mafikeng  in  North  West.  Those  are
opportunities for facilitating communication  between  this  House  and  the
community at a higher level. The community puts  its  needs  across  to  the
National Council and the Council is also afforded an opportunity for  visits
in order to observe community  development  or  assess  the  needs  of  that
community, etc.

We  have  observed  situations  where  the  Government  allocated  money  to
provinces and that money simply disappeared without trace.  In  short,  that
paints a picture of dishonesty regarding a task that has  been  assigned  to
one. I am not talking here about  an  employee  who  is  lazy  or  embezzles
public money. Even those who are at higher  levels  get  into  deep  trouble
through their  failure  to  monitor  Government  projects.  Those  who  have
monitoring mechanisms are able to nip corruption in the bud,  and  then  the
law takes its course and things get sorted out before it's too late.

The monitoring function should focus on existing laws,  money  allocated  to
cater for needs,  the  implementation  of  laws  in  the  provinces,  assess
whether there is development or not and those  things  that  are  needed  to
facilitate the development of communities. All of that require a person  who
knows his or her job, who is  honest,  trustworthy,  responsible  and  looks
after the interests of Government and  departments  throughout  a  province,
from provincial government right down to  local  government,  etc.  I  thank
you.]

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, hon members,  I  think  I  agree  with  the  hon
Vilakazi that one of the key  thrusts  of  our  oversight  function,  beyond
legislative and other functions that we are exercising, is  to  ensure  that
from time to time we check the extent to which our own executive  and  other
organs of state are performing to uplift  the  conditions  of  life  of  our
people in relation to homelessness, hunger, poverty  and  all  other  social
ills. I think I agree with that.

In that respect, the NCOP as an evolving institution, which is  hardly  five
years old - or is it six? - has actually risen to the challenges  by  coming
up with very innovative mechanisms to begin a very rigorous  and  systematic
contact with  the  masses  of  our  people  dealing  with  issues  that  are
affecting our people beyond issues of legislation. I  think  the  manner  in
which we have structured our provincial weeks is  a  clear  pointer  in  the
direction of that innovation and  we  have  been  very  successful  in  that
particular respect.

It has not been a public relations exercise, in  the  sense  that  where  we
have been able to pick up issues raised by our people  and  issues  that  we
have observed where we have identified gaps in  relation  both  to  our  own
legislation and to policies, we have been able to come back  to  this  House
and have a debate, drawing the attention of the  executive  to  those  gaps.
And, in most instances, the executive  has  been  very  positive  in  making
clear commitments in order to address those gaps. On that note, I  think  we
are on course in terms of accelerating the pace  of  transformation  in  our
country.
It is worth mentioning that  the  transformation  of  the  Senate  into  the
National Council of Provinces in 1996, as a result of the  adoption  of  the
new Constitution, ushered in a completely new  regime  of  the  exercise  of
political power unique to our own country. This  uniqueness  is  marked  by,
amongst  other  things,  the  distinct  role  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces in terms of which it  enjoins  the  three  spheres  of  government
under one roof to discuss  both  legislative  and  policy  matters  and  any
matter that is of national importance affecting the lives of our people.

Over and above outlining structures and  systems  of  political  order,  our
Constitution further espouses values that recognise  the  diversity  of  our
nation, thus committing the state and its   organs  not  only  to  recognise
these disparities but, more importantly, to work hard  for  the  eradication
of these disparities within the limits of the  resources  available  to  the
country.

The following are the core values  of  our  Constitution:  the  question  of
human dignity, the achievement of equality  and  the  advancement  of  human
rights and  freedom;  nonracialism  and  nonsexism;  the  supremacy  of  the
Constitution and the rule of law; and universal adult suffrage,  a  national
common  voters'  roll,  regular  elections  and  a  multiparty   system   of
democratic  government  to   ensure   accountability,   responsiveness   and
openness.

Critical to the exercise of oversight and  accountability  in  the  National
Council of  Provinces  is  the  need  to  constantly  seek  to  measure  the
performance of the executive and all other organs  of  state  against  these
values. We are not just doing it  in  a  vacuum.  We  are  not  just  asking
questions for the sake of asking questions. Our questions and oversight  are
informed by these fundamental  values  to  ensure  that  our  country  moves
gradually and steadily to a situation where there will be  equality  amongst
our people; to ensure that all our people live  in  decent  houses  and  are
accorded  the  dignity  and  respect  that  they  deserve.  Those  are   the
fundamental values that inform our oversight work from time to time.

There is a view, though not openly expressed, that  tends  to  relegate  the
NCOP to the role of intervention, as the hon Lever has said,  in  accordance
with provisions such as sections 100  and  139  of  the  Constitution.  This
view, in the main, presupposes that the role of the  NCOP  in  oversight  is
limited to those particular areas of interventions and not similar, both  in
terms of content and weight, to the role that is exercised by  the  National
Assembly, which is our counterpart.

We are saying this afternoon that that view is incorrect, because  there  is
no way that we, as the representatives of our various legislatures  in  this
House, as voices of our local  government  in  the  various  provinces,  can
articulate  their  aspirations  and  difficulties  in  this  House   without
understanding their issues. So we cannot limit our  interventions  to  those
specific sections of the Constitution  which  are  enabling  this  House  to
intervene  where  national  and  provincial  government,  respectively,  are
intervening in issues of local government. I think  we  have  to  make  that
point quite loud and clear.

As other members have mentioned, there are clear areas where,  in  my  view,
we need to improve in terms of the area of oversight, not only as  the  NCOP
but as Parliament as a whole.  Obviously,  there  are  various  systems  and
instruments that we use to exercise this oversight.  In  terms  of  in-house
arrangements we use  questions  to  Ministers,  policy  review  debates  and
committees, by  calling  various  Government  departments  and  other  state
agencies to brief the committees. The question is: Is that enough?  I  argue
that it is not enough.

I don't think we have been able as a House - given our uniqueness, which  is
defined by our nature of representing specific  interests,  those  interests
being the interests of local and provincial government  -  to  have  a  very
structured dynamic and systematic  contact  with  that  base,  the  base  of
organised local government and that of our own legislatures.

Quite obviously, as I am sure all of you will agree, we go to our  provinces
when we have to brief them on certain  pieces  of  legislation,  and  that's
all. We don't have a structured time when we,  as  permanent  delegates  who
are representing the provinces in this House, e are able  to  sit  down  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and colleagues,  it  would  appear  that  the
terms ''oversight'' and ''accountability'' in a  parliamentary  context  are
somewhat complex and that they need some understanding,  and  I  quote  from
the consultant's report under the heading Oversight: The difficult  role  of
Parliament,  which  states  that  ''effective  and  proper   oversight   and
accountability requires of members to fully  understand  the  constitutional
justifications and rationale behind accountable government''.

If this were not the case, why  would  the  Ad  Hoc  Joint  Subcommittee  on
Parliamentary Oversight and Accountability  have  appointed  consultants  to
advise them on the subject matter and taken almost four years to  produce  a
final report?

The term ''oversight'' refers to a variety of aspects of a large  number  of
monitoring and reviewing activities carried out by legislatures in  relation
to the executive, but it can only be effective if  recognised  by  those  in
power as being the central organising principle of our Constitution.
One can, however, also state what oversight is not. Oversight is  definitely
not the sole domain of opposition parties, nor  is  it  supposed  to  be  an
instrument at the disposal  of  opposition  parties  for  scoring  political
points.

To quote the hon Chief Whip of this House:


  Oversight is not only about  being  critical  but  also  about  remedying
  defects ... it is about all spheres coming together and starting  to  ask
  where the problem is and how to identify it and also how to correct it.

If I can put it in different words:  Good  oversight  will  involve  parties
discussing the existence and nature of a problem or a problematic  situation
and reaching consensus about it and trying to solve the  identified  problem
in a co-operative way to the advantage of the people who have elected us  to
the positions we occupy in this House.

The practice of oversight  within  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  is
performed mainly by select committees and their  chairpersons  and  members.
Select committees are therefore  the  most  important  oversight  mechanisms
available to the NCOP, especially when oversight occurs as a  result  of  or
is triggered by visits to provinces and nodal points, interaction  with  the
people and public hearings.

Practical examples of oversight on a wider  scale  were  the  NCOP's  visits
last year to the Eastern  Cape  and  last  week  to  the  North  West.  Such
oversight visits will, however, be in vain and a fruitless exercise if  that
which was seen and heard is not turned into action.

It would appear at times that due  to  the  wide  range  covered  by  select
committees and the limited number of members,  select  committees  lack  the
tools to perform effective oversight, which leads one to ask the  rhetorical
question: Is it a question of too few members with too little time  and  too
much work?

The nature of oversight, however, also heavily depends on the nature of  the
select committee. In the case of the Select Committee on Finance,  oversight
is of a financial nature. Its oversight role is to see to it that  provinces
and municipalities get their fair share in the division of revenue process.

Questions looked into and pondered about are whether the funds are spent  in
the intended  manner  and  whether  the  funds  reach  those  parts  of  the
population where they should make a difference and create a better life  for
all.

This can only be  effected  by  doing  oversight  in  the  annual  processes
leading up to the actual Budget with hearings, also in conjunction with  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission, held with civil society in  the  provinces,
and briefings to the  select  committee  separately  and  jointly  with  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance.

I conclude by stating that the NCOP has a  definite  and  vitally  important
role to play in parliamentary oversight and accountability  -  also  through
and  by  its  representatives  appointed  by  the  President  in  the  Audit
Commission. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I  have  been  advised  that  speakers
number 6 and 7 will not be participating in the debate.

Mr T B TAABE: Hon Deputy Chair of Chairs and hon members of the NCOP,  thank
you very much indeed, hon Deputy Chair  of  Chairs,  for  affording  me  the
opportunity this afternoon to address the House on the role and function  of
oversight and accountability in the National Council of Provinces.

This important and historic  debate  comes  almost  eight  years  after  the
democratisation of our country, a country delivered by the glorious army  of
the people, namely the ANC, from a morally  repugnant  system  of  apartheid
and white supremacist rule.

Since our establishment seven years ago, South Africa still  faces  enormous
challenges to improve the lives of its citizens and to  ensure  that  indeed
as a Government we are  able  to  perform  effectively  and  efficiently  in
delivering services to all our people. This is a  responsibility  we  cannot
abrogate as elected public representatives, for we have  a  direct  interest
in overseeing the executive in this country.

Clearly our oversight role  as  an  institution  should  not  be  understood
purely on a literal or technical reading of the Constitution  alone,  as  is
often myopically understood by other parties in  this  Chamber,  and  should
thus be understood in the context of what our  actual  role  as  members  of
this House is, in discharging, without fear, the responsibility of  bringing
about delivery and  social  transformation,  a  task  we  have  meticulously
executed as  the  African  National  Congress.  Our  Constitution  therefore
places a number of expectations on the shoulders of this House  in  relation
to oversight and accountability.

This expectation behoves us to continue  in  a  relentless  manner  to  draw
provincial and  local  experience  into  the  national  discourse  when  the
effectiveness of policy implementation is considered. This should  therefore
enable us to be sensitive and responsive to  the  conditions  and  needs  of
everyone in our country  irrespective  of  race,  creed,  colour  or  sexual
orientation.

The point must be made that as the  NCOP  we  are  strategically  placed  to
facilitate, practically and in a sustained way, the sharing  of  experiences
and ideas among all our provincial legislatures and local  government.  This
should enable us to identify common problems and  best  practices  with  the
express view and intent to enhance  and  deepen  the  capacity  of  all  the
spheres of government. In this way we are able as the NCOP to carry out  our
constitutional mandate on  oversight  -  different  from  other  legislative
bodies.

It is therefore important for us to continue to do  all  that  is  necessary
and within our means to creatively develop  mechanisms  that  ensure  closer
interaction with  our  provincial  legislatures  and  indeed  with  all  our
people. Some of the hon members did in fact  allude  to  what  the  NCOP  is
practically doing, by way of our campaigns in relation to taking  Parliament
to the people, provincial visits to provinces, our provincial weeks  and  so
forth, to practically  ensure  that  indeed  we  are  able  to  deepen  this
interaction between the NCOP and  the  provincial  legislatures,  which  has
become an absolute necessity with all our people.

We should therefore  ensure  that  we  have  access  to  the  reports  which
provincial executives present to the legislatures so that  we  are  informed
of progress made and challenges experienced in  the  process  of  delivering
quality services to our people. Equally we must continue  to  interact  with
the national executive so that we are in a better position to contribute  to
ensuring that indeed there is better  co-operation  between  and  among  all
spheres of government.

Much as we accept that  in  any  democracy  such  as  ours  there  would  be
different political views and  expressions  as  a  central  feature  of  the
legislative processes, if executed maturely oversight should  contribute  to
the process of broader societal change. As elected representatives we  would
therefore be able to ensure that whatever new legislative  developments  are
made should recognise both the successes and failures  of  past  legislation
to better manage challenges of present and future legislation.

We  must  also  exercise  greater  vigilance   in   the   area   of   policy
implementation and  be  unwavering  in  our  quest  to  ensure  that  indeed
Government  policy  remains  sensitive  and  responsive  to  the  needs  and
concerns of all our people.  I  thank  you,  hon  Deputy  Chair  of  Chairs.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Deputy  Chairperson,
members of the National Council of Provinces, I wish to thank you very  much
for  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  this  debate,  and  I  wish   to
congratulate all the members who participated before me. I think  the  point
has been made and has been driven home.  We  all  of  us  are  beginning  to
understand the importance of the oversight function and accountability  that
we all have to undertake. I wouldn't like to try to describe what  oversight
and accountability are all about.  I  think  most  of  you  have  done  that
wonderfully and very accurately.

However, I would like to point out that  the  importance  of  the  oversight
function, especially as exercised by  members  of  Parliament,  has  certain
aspects. First, it helps us to ensure  that  the  executive  implements  the
laws in the way required by the legislature and according  to  the  dictates
of the Constitution. I think that is a fundamental point  that  we  need  to
make here.

Secondly, it ensures effective government by  ensuring  that  the  executive
carries out its mandate, monitoring the implementation  of  its  legislative
policies and drawing on the experiences for future law-making. I think  that
is quite critical. You don't just make the laws and leave them lying  there.
You need somebody to monitor the implementation of  those  particular  laws.
We  all  understand  that  the  executive  are  charged  with  the  work  of
implementing legislation, and we as members of Parliament are  charged  with
the work of monitoring particularly that implementation.

Thirdly, the oversight function encourages open government, which is also  a
requirement of our Constitution. This serves to  enhance  public  confidence
in that particular government and ensures that a  government  is  close  and
responsive to the people that it governs. It is  precisely  because  of  the
oversight function and the monitoring that we carry down to the  structures,
to the people lower down on the street, that they can  begin  to  understand
that they have got a Government that cares about them,  that  is  closer  to
them, that is open to them and that is really  interested  in  making  their
lives better,  by  going  down  there  and  looking  precisely  at  what  is
happening. I think that those are important factors that would count  to  us
especially  as  members  of  Parliament,  as  we  carry  out  our  oversight
function.

But let me also come to the  question  that  says  that  at  the  particular
moment it is not very clear in the Constitution nor in our  Rules  what  the
oversight function is. We still have to come up with  mechanisms  that  will
spell out very clearly what it is that we are expected to do as  members  of
Parliament. However,  that  does  not  prevent  us  from  carrying  out  our
oversight function on a day-to-day basis.

Another important fact that I want to  mention  is  that  oversight  carries
with  it  certain  expectations   and   obligations,   which   include   the
identification of aberrations and clear steps to rectify and make amends  to
alleviate any fault that occurs. I think Mr Lever referred to  this  earlier
on.
You see, the important point  is  that  when  you  discover  that  there  is
something wrong in your oversight function, then you  don't  leave  it  like
that. The job that we should be awake and alive to is that once we  pick  up
the things that are not right, then we must  come  here  and  correct  them.
Those are things that affect the citizens that have placed  you  and  me  in
the positions we are in in Parliament today.

Let me just pause a little there and say that we  are  the  most  advantaged
people. You are the person who has  the  last  word  in  Parliament  and  in
government. You are a very special person,  because  you  are  performing  a
specific duty as a member of Parliament. The person in  the  street  doesn't
know how we make laws in Parliament. The person in  the  street  depends  on
you to make these laws on his or her behalf. That is  precisely  the  reason
they stood up in 1994 and 1999 and went to  the  polls.  They  queued  there
because they wanted people to make laws in Parliament on their behalf.

At the same time, it is those who people who said that they  would  like  to
see this Government deliver, and it is you and I who have to  make  a  point
of it that the laws that we are making are implemented to make the lives  of
our people better. So those people in Mosterloos, where I come  from,  those
people in the rural areas of Bushbuckridge,  those  citizens  in  the  rural
areas of Qunu and those in Mahlabathini, who are not in a position  to  come
here, are looking to you and me and are asking: What are you doing  for  us?
Why are the things going wrong? Why go to Parliament  and  keep  quiet,  and
not say anything about the things that you observe are not going right?

That is why I want to emphasise the point that the oversight function  plays
a very, very important role.  We  cannot  see  things  going  wrong  on  the
ground, come here, talk,  close  the  session,  go  home  and  pretend  that
nothing has happened. Our  duty  is  to  correct  the  wrongs  that  we  see
happening on a daily basis.

Parliamentary  committees,  wherever  they  are,  whether  in  the  National
Council of Provinces or in the National  Assembly,  have  a  constitutional,
social and moral obligation to ensure that  the  policies,  legislation  and
programmes of Government are implemented efficiently to  improve  the  lives
of all our people in South Africa. That is a  critical  point.  It  is  your
moral and social obligation as a member of Parliament not to keep  quiet  if
you go down there to the grass-roots level and see that programmes  are  not
being implemented even though we budgeted for them.

How many times have you passed a bridge with a foundation, but with no  wall
having been built until today? And what have you said  about  it?  Have  you
been quiet about it or you have raised it? That is part of  our  job.  These
are precisely the things that affect the lives of our people on the  ground.
These are the things that we need to raise and fight for on a daily basis.

Parliament, and especially the National Council of Provinces, plays  a  very
important  role  in  this  process  because  it  is   entrusted   with   the
responsibility to measure the extent to which  departments  are  keeping  to
their development objectives, outputs and service delivery.  Those  are  the
two main critical points by which you can be in a position  to  measure  the
performance of a department.

Let me tell you why you are very important and why you're  very  special  in
terms of playing your role as a  member  of  Parliament.  We  sit  here  and
approve budgets every year.  The President stands at the podium  every  year
and outlines the programmes of the  departments  for  the  whole  year.  The
President states precisely what the departments have  got  to  do  and  what
they have got to budget for.

The national Minister of Finance outlines the Budget every year in  February
and says how much each department has. What is  it  that  we  are  doing  to
follow up and measure the output of each Minister's department in  terms  of
the money it has received to deliver programmes? How many  times  do  we  do
that? We come back the following year, we have not checked that, and we  say
that things are not happening on the ground.

We as members of Parliament can play a vital  role  in  terms  of  financial
oversight functions. Not only that, how many  of  us  critically  scrutinise
the Budget? How many of us really influence the shaping of the  Budget?  How
many of us really study the documents that come from the Treasury? How  many
of us really seriously look  at  the  departmental  budgets,  how  they  are
spent, where they show weaknesses and the capacities they need in order  for
them  to  deliver  those  programmes,  and  state  here  what  needs  to  be
corrected?

These are the things we that we need to do, because if we fall  short  here,
if we don't do them, people are going to do whatever they want and they  are
going to get away with murder. We are here, we see these  things,  we  don't
measure people's output and their outcomes. We simply keep quiet.

Besides  that,  the  fact  that  the  general  oversight  responsibility  of
Parliament  is  not  all  that  clearly  articulated  does  not  mean   that
Parliament, especially the National Council  of  Provinces,  is  lacking  in
this regard. On the contrary, the National Council  of  Provinces  has  been
very, very creative in responding to this challenge. We are  developing  our
own oversight practice based on particular  circumstances  in  our  country.
Oversight  is  therefore  a  mechanism  used  by  the  National  Council  of
Provinces and individual members  to  ensure  that  the  executive  and  the
provincial and local government departments give feasible  explanations  for
their actions, on policies, administration  and  budgetary  controls.  These
are the issues we need  to  look  at  as  members  of  Parliament.  This  is
critical.

I think it was Mr Setona who referred to  the  work  of  the  committees  in
Parliament. I'm just going to  deal  with  one  aspect  of  that  work:  the
reports that we write as committees. When we go on an oversight visit  or  a
provincial week, we come back and produce a report. I don't  care  how  many
pages long that report is. The thing that worries me is what we do with  the
recommendations that we put in that report. To me,  that  is  vital.  Do  we
stand up in this Chamber and mention them once, and  then  put  that  report
aside and let it rot on our bookshelves? Do we then go  back  to  that  very
area the following year, find  the  very  same  mistakes,  come  back  here,
debate them, shelve the report and come back again  the  third  year,  until
the term of Parliament has ended and no corrective steps have been taken?

What mechanism do we have in place to say ... Is  my  time  up?  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 THE UNILATERAL INTENTION TO DECLARE WAR BY THE USA, BRITAIN AND SPAIN, AND
               THE IMPLICATION FOR WORLD PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, Doctor Martin  Luther  King  Jnr
stated:
  Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.

Indeed, what we have witnessed in the past few  weeks  was  an  unusual  and
extraordinary phenomenon when men and women, young and old,  of  all  shades
and  colours,  creeds  and  religious  persuasions,  political  beliefs  and
convictions throughout the world got together and said: Stop the  war.  This
call has not been a call that has been located within the boundaries of  our
country or our continent, it was a universal call by humankind to say:  Stop
the war!

We  believe  that  this  collective  action  of  millions  of  our  citizens
throughout the world inspired the Secretary-General of the  United  Nations,
Kofi Annan, to state, on 10 March 2003, the following:


  All around the globe, people  want  to  see  the  Iraqi  crisis  resolved
  peacefully. It could cause great human suffering. It may lead to regional
  instability and economic crisis.

We have also witnessed, just yesterday and a few days before that, the  most
astounding rebellion in the history of Britain  in  the  House  of  Commons,
where within the Labour Party, we have had resignations by members of  their
cabinet and divisions in terms of the views and positions of members of  the
House  of  Commons  in  relation  to  the  drastic  action  that  is   being
contemplated by the British government.

We have also witnessed that  an  unusually  important  phenomenon  has  also
emerged - that of the accountability of the executive in responding  to  the
opinions, the pleas and the demands of the people on the ground. This  is  a
phenomenon that we cannot ignore.

We have also witnessed  the  lobbying  by  the  great  powers,  America  and
Britain, in using aid and trade in order to win support for  positions  that
they feel are  correct  and  legitimate.  The  call  by  the  South  African
Government and the people of South Africa is: Iraq, comply with  the  United
Nations  resolutions!  Iraq,  disarm!  We  do  not  want  weapons  of   mass
destruction.

We are neither anti-American nor anti-British nor anti-Spanish.  Our  appeal
is a sincere appeal to say that the inspections should continue.  They  have
yielded active results. The tide has turned in terms  of  the  lack  of  co-
operation, and we should give peace a chance.

As we reflect on this matter, we should remember that the only country  that
has used atomic or nuclear warfare is America. Hiroshima  and  Nagasaki  are
but two illustrations of the devastation and ruin  that  can  be  caused  to
humanity, and the continued suffering in the aftermath  of  a  war.  Let  us
also remember that America constitutes 6% of the population  of  the  world,
and yet it spends more than R400  billion  -  that  is  half  the  estimated
military budgets of all the countries on this continent - on the  production
of warfare armaments. That is important.

Let us remember that Iraq has the second largest reservoir  of  oil  in  the
world. That is an important point to remember. Let us also remember that  in
Vietnam, America used chemical warfare - thousands and thousands  of  litres
of chemicals - on the people of Vietnam, and as  we  do  so,  we  must  also
remember that more than 750 000 people died in Iraq - children,  not  people
- in the aftermath of the Gulf War.

As we do so, we must remember that the result of the Gulf War  in  Iraq  was
that water was contaminated, infrastructure was destroyed.  People  suffered
and continue to  suffer.  There  is  malnutrition.  There  is  typhoid.  The
mortality rate of  the  children  of  Iraq  and  women  has  increased  very
significantly.

It is this kind of aftermath, this kind of disaster  which  prompted  Dennis
Halliday, a person who served the UN faithfully and loyally in  Iraq  for  a
period of 34 years, to resign. It is  important  to  quote  what  he  stated
amongst his reasons for his resignation:


  I  have  been  instructed  to  implement  a  policy  that  satisfies  the
  definition of genocide: a deliberate policy that has  effectively  killed
  well over a million individuals,  children  and  adults.  The  policy  of
  economic sanctions is totally bankrupt.

These were his words, and his resignation was followed  by  the  resignation
of somebody who replaced him and who had also served the UN for a period  of
30 years.

What is the view of the world in relation to  this  matter?  The  Nonaligned
Movement has expressed its view that Iraq must disarm. That is the  view  of
all South Africans, I believe, of all shades and opinions. Iraq must  disarm
and do away with the weapons of mass destruction. Let it not only  be  Iraq.
Let it also be Israel and all the countries in the Middle East. A war is  no
good. These weapons of mass destruction do not  foster  peace,  but  are  in
fact a catalyst for warfare.

We have also said collectively - that has been the view of the  UN  and  all
countries,  the  European  summit  and  the  Franco-African  summit  -  that
multilateralism must prevail. We cannot have a situation where we erode  the
credibility of the UN which was founded on the UN  Charter,  which  in  fact
represents the co-operation of the diverse nations of this  world.  That  is
the appeal.

We believe that America and Britain are quite well-equipped. If you look  at
the checklist, they have the ships, they have  the  planes,  they  have  the
helicopters, they have the missiles, and the armaments. They  have  all  the
relevant equipment necessary in order to initiate  war.  Yet  there  is  one
thing lacking in their inventory: a reason. The reason is lacking.  This  is
why the people of the world are saying that we should give peace a chance.

If we look at the UN resolution, it is to disarm  Iraq  and  to  prevent  it
from possessing weapons of mass destruction. It is not about the removal  of
the regime. The reason for doing what  the  inspectors  are  doing  has  now
disappeared. A new reason has been found: Saddam  Hussein  must  be  removed
from office.

The position, if I could end, of this Government is that a war  would  cause
serious economic losses  to  the  developing  nations,  the  people  of  the
country, and to the poverty-stricken. It is not the view of  this  House,  I
believe, that we should support a regime such as  that  of  Saddam  Hussein,
but that we should ask for peace and to say: Give peace a  chance,  and  let
us ensure that we support the initiatives of the  UN  Security  Council  and
promote multilateralism. If not, we are faced with war. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair, hon fellow South Africans, now I  know  what  people
mean when they say, ``Great minds think  alike''.  Believe  it  or  not,  my
speech also begins with a reference to one of  the  world's  greatest  icons
and apostles of international peace  and  human  rights,  Dr  Martin  Luther
King, who spoke about the dilemma and the  challenge  that  leaders  of  the
world have to face in times of crisis.

We are on the threshold of a terrible war sponsored by the United States  of
America, under the presidency of George W  Bush,  against  Iraq  and  Saddam
Hussein. It is almost a fait accompli. That we have reached this sorry  pass
is due in no small  measure  to  the  failure  of  multilateralism.  The  UN
Security Council, which today is divided on the issue, must take  a  careful
look at itself. When, after the Gulf War, the UN  passed  no  less  than  16
resolutions on Iraq, calling for the dismantling of its  war  machinery,  it
failed to execute, once and for all, the  coup  de  grâce  that  would  have
given Saddam Hussein his comeuppance.

Instead, the council adopted a lukewarm attitude, and failed  the  challenge
of asserting itself as a world monitor of war and  peace.  The  UN  Security
Council today is unanimous about the danger posed by Saddam and his  weapons
of mass destruction, but is divided about how to deal with them.

For 12 years, it adopted an indifferent  posture  towards  the  recalcitrant
Iraq. [Interjections.] I would expect people to make  relevant,  useful  and
intelligent interjections. [Laughter.] We must note that the UN was born  of
a strong determination to  ensure  that  never  again  would  nation  states
resort to arms to settle disputes. The name of the  game  was  dialogue  and
discourse across the discussion tables but, alas, the weakness of the  human
condition prevails.

President George W Bush, with the support  of  Britain's  Tony  Blair,  with
Spain and Australia behind them, has declared his  intentions  unequivocally
to commence attacks on Iraq  at  3  am  tomorrow.  [Interjections.]  France,
Russia, Germany and China, and virtually the rest of  the  world,  including
South Africa, are not eager to support the war  effort.  There  are  antiwar
dissidents within America and  Great  Britain,  but  the  warmongers  remain
unmoved.

The hon Chief Whip  referred  to  the  detonation  of  the  atomic  bomb  on
Nagasaki and Hiroshima, when a shocked world realised what  a  potent  force
the atomic bomb was when it was unleashed on an unsuspecting world. At  that
time, there was a call to  war,  and  there  was  a  fight  for  ideological
supremacy. Not today. Saddam Hussein and George W Bush are equally  culpable
with  regard  to  this  sorry  state  of  affairs.  Both   must   bear   the
responsibility for the failure of multilateralism. [Interjections.]  Neither
Saddam  Houssein  nor  George  Bush  comes  out  smelling  of  roses.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I now know  that  when
my mike is switched off, it means my time is  up.  I  didn't  know  that.  I
thought somebody was playing with the mike. [Laughter.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson,  the  New  NP  still  believes,  with  many
others, that the USA should not attack Iraq unilaterally. The New  NP  still
believes that war is not an appropriate  mechanism  to  solve  international
disputes. Unfortunately, our beliefs are  not  relevant  at  this  point  in
time. The USA is going to attack Iraq unilaterally.

The failure of the UN to take effective punitive measures against  Iraq  for
having thus far transgressed 12 UN resolutions is partly to blame  for  this
sorry state of affairs. Unfortunately, the USA has reached  a  point  of  no
return.
Only one man can stop an attack on Iraq, and that is  not  George  W.  Bush.
The fact is that if they back down now, it  will  be  interpreted  by  rogue
states and organisations such as North Korea  and  Al-Qaeda  as  a  sign  of
weakness. It will create a perception that the only superpower in the  world
is nothing more than a papertiger, with  devastating  consequences  for  the
safety of the free world.

The only man that can stop the war now within the next 24  hours  is  Saddam
Hussein. If he went into exile, as proposed not only by George W  Bush,  but
also by prominent leaders of the Gulf states, that  attack  will  be  called
off,  because  it  is  believed  that  Iraq  will  then  adhere  to  the  UN
resolutions. [Interjections.]

The fate of Iraq and its people  is  therefore  entirely  in  the  hands  of
Saddam Hussein. It is unthinkable that a head of state could be prepared  to
sacrifice a whole nation merely to hang on to ... [Interjections.]

Mr T B TAABE: Chair, I would like to know whether  the  hon  member  Mr  Van
Niekerk will take a question.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like to take the question.  I  just
want to finish my argument. If he still wants to ask a question, he  may  do
so, with pleasure. [Interjections.]

I want to repeat, the question whether the US should attack  Iraq  in  order
to disarm them is no longer relevant. The US will attack Iraq.

The only relevant remaining question is, and this is  important:  What  will
South Africa's position be when the US  attacks  Iraq  with  or  without  UN
consent? [Interjections.] The only sensible thing for  South  Africa  to  do
would be to stay neutral at all times. If we want to sign our death  warrant
economically,  then  we  must  openly  come  out  on  the  side   of   Iraq.
[Interjections.]

In the field of international diplomacy ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order,  hon  members.
Give Mr Van Niekerk time to put his point. Mr Van Niekerk, continue.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: In the field of international diplomacy,  there  are  no
such things as friends, only interests. It will not  be  in  South  Africa's
national interest to side with Iraq in case of a war between  Iraq  and  the
US. The best option for South Africa would be to stay neutral at  all  times
when the US unilaterally attacks Iraq.

It seems, however, as if a position of neutrality is  not  self-evident,  as
we hear from the reaction here. Iraq is thousands of  kilometres  away  from
South Africa, and America's  wars  should  not  automatically  become  South
Africa's wars. The US however remains the only superpower in the  world  and
it  would  be  plain  foolish  to  side  with   an   opponent   of   theirs.
[Interjections.] Humanitarian aid to the civilians ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order, order, hon  Van
Niekerk.

Ms J L KGOALI: Would the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Hon  Van  Niekerk,
would you like to take a question?
Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, I will take the  question.  I  have  one
paragraph left. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Hon Windvoël?

Mr V V Z WINDVOëL: Chairperson, I want to know whether Mr Van Niekerk  would
have agreed if the US had said that Mr De Klerk had to go into exile?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I don't  know  whether
he will take that question. You didn't ask him first whether he  would  take
a question! [Interjections.] Continue, hon Van Niekerk.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: It's a pity that people don't really listen.  They  just
hear sounds, and they react to sounds! [Interjections.]

I said humanitarian aid to the civilian population of Iraq, who will  become
the main  victims  of  war,  is  the  right  thing  to  do,  and  should  be
encouraged. Support for this regime, however, would be  a  fatal  diplomatic
blunder to the detriment of South Africa's national interest.
The Chief Whip started off by saying that he is not for or  against  America
or Iraq. He wanted to give peace a chance, and I agree. But then  he  lashed
out against America, and we have the reaction here of  the  many  colleagues
lashing out against America. [Interjections.] We must be very  careful.  The
time has come for the South African Government to say in no uncertain  terms
what South Africa's position is on the US attack. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Your  time  has
expired, hon member. [Interjections.] No, his time has expired. [Laughter.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson,  I  think  it's  unfair  that  hon  members  are
allowed  to  take  that  hon  member's  time  and  he  not  be  compensated.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Order! You  are
not correct, Mr Durr. We have not taken any minutes from  Mr  Van  Niekerk's
time. I am in control of time here. I will never rob any member of time.

The CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  I  just  wanted  to  enquire
whether there was a coalition in the making  between  Mr  Durr  and  Mr  Van
Niekerk on this issue.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Maybe  he  can  take
that up. Hon Durr?

Mr K D S DURR: Thank you, Chairman. The clock starts now.

President Bush is subjected to abuse which  is  reminiscent  of  the  1930s,
when Winston Churchill was vilified as a warmonger when  he  warned  of  the
dangers posed by Nazi Germany. Blair has had the same problem today. But  it
is Saddam Hussein, not President Bush, who is in flagrant  defiance  of  the
UN Security Council resolutions and has been for the past 12 years.  He  has
persistently flouted all  attempts  and  ignored  all  instructions  of  the
Security Council to give up his weapons of mass destruction.

If Saddam Hussein complied fully with  the  letter  and  spirit  of  the  UN
instructions, it would not have been necessary to force him to  do  so  now.
The real issue is not whether President Bush or Mr Blair or anybody else  is
acting outside the framework of the UN, but  whether  the  Security  Council
itself condones further  flagrant  Iraqi  defiance.  By  doing  so,  the  UN
becomes as impotent as  the  old  League  of  Nations,  and  terrorism  will
flourish worldwide. It will be the end of the development of our  continent.
Our continent will not  develop  while  the  world  is  focused  upon  these
matters or while world terrorism flourishes. Only world peace and  expanding
markets will make it possible for our country and our continent to  develop.
It is in our interests that we do this. [Interjections.]

We in this House need to ask ourselves only one question. We are elected  by
the South African people to serve their best interests. We are  not  elected
to  serve   Iraq's,   Bush's,   Blair's   or   anybody   else's   interests.
[Interjections.] You put it so well yourself, Mr Chairman, in  the  previous
debate. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Order!

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Hon Moatshe?
Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I just wanted to ask the hon member  whether  he
will be able to take a question.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Hon  Durr,  will  you
take a question? He says he won't take a question. Continue, hon Durr.

Mr K D S DURR: What  is  in  our  best  interests?  We  have  sought,  quite
properly, to work fully within the UN and  to  help  it.  Our  President,  I
think, has done his very best to put the necessary  pressure  upon  Iraq  to
disarm. I agree with the member who  spoke  before  me.  We  must  not  take
sides.  We  must  remain  neutral  and  nonaligned.  Any  other  action   is
meaningless and will be counterproductive and  will  expose  faultlines  and
divisions in South African society.

The war will soon be over.  [Interjections.]  These  things  will  pass  and
prosperity will return. We must remember that we are here to  act  in  South
Africa's best interests. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Give  the  hon
member a chance, please.
Mr K D S DURR: It's the victor who writes the history  books.  South  Africa
has missed the great booms of the  1980s  and  the  1990s  because  we  have
paralysed ourselves with politics. We must  not  let  politics  pollute  the
future of this country any longer. We must be part of  the  future  and  not
sideline ourselves by putting South Africa on the  wrong  side  of  history,
not to be seen as supporting or abetting ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Order!  Hon
Moatshe?

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order, hon  Durr!  Hon
Moatshe?

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, there is no neutrality as far as  the  truth  is
concerned. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Hon  Moatshe,  you're
not yet on the platform. Hon Durr, you have half a  minute  to  finish  your
speech.

Mr K D S DURR: In the past we saw world trade expand  when  the  Royal  Navy
cleared the seas of piracy so that world trade could prosper. In  the  1970s
we saw air piracy, when the international action led by  the  Americans  and
other states had to rid the world of air piracy. We now have the scourge  of
terrorism. Terrorism threatens globalisation, peace and the  development  of
this continent, and it takes the focus off  the  great  development  actions
that are necessary for our continent, our people and our nation. We have  to
bring that focus back and put this country on the side  of  the  angels  and
develop our continent. I thank you.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson and hon members of  this  House,  whatever  the
circumstances and reasons may be, war is devastating  and  its  implications
and consequences far exceed its justifications over a long  period  of  time
thereafter. The UCDP believes that war is not an  appropriate  mechanism  to
solve international problems and disputes.

There is no certainty of what exactly the impending war is  all  about.  The
most common reason given is the removal of the weapons of  mass  destruction
that the UN inspectors are investigating. However, it would appear that  the
delayed but inevitable result of the September 11 attacks of two  years  ago
may be the most important reason behind the war.

Another clear factor that may be  intolerable  to  the  US  is  that  Saddam
Hussein is a  tyrant  who  rules  his  people  with  violence.  However,  we
maintain that whatever the reason may be, the ultimate solution  thereof  is
through dialogue and negotiations in appropriate forums.[ Applause.]

A  war  of  this  magnitude  is  going  to  destabilise  world   peace   and
development. It is going to bring about human  suffering  and  the  loss  of
human lives and material goods and is going to dismantle  all  developmental
initiatives set up in the developing countries. The UCDP  does  not  support
war. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson, I rise here to share the  sentiments  of  those
who condemn in the strongest terms the move by the US to  wage  war  against
Iraq.  President  Bush   is   deliberately   and   intentionally   violating
international law by waging an illegal war  against  Iraq,  a  small  nation
with a population which is half the size of our own in South Africa.

The action by the US puts the UN in a predicament.  The  world  is  watching
this scenario with mixed feelings, surprise and questions -  questions  such
as: Does the UN have powers to give and enforce orders  on  a  member  state
that interferes in the domestic affairs of other  sovereign  states?  A  bad
precedent has been  created.  What  will  prevent  Britain  and  Spain  from
engaging in the same acts of aggression should circumstances permit?

America has been vocal about the replacement  of  Saddam  Hussein's  regime,
but has been silent on one aspect, which is the  kind  and  type  of  regime
that will succeed Saddam Hussein. If America  succeeds  in  removing  Saddam
Hussein by  force  or  by  unilateral  means,  what  will  prevent  it  from
dictating the nature of the regime and selecting the leader of their  choice
for that country? This is a dictatorship in its strongest terms.

Mangope did it in the former homelands. As one homeland  leader  once  said,
``Mangope did it. Why can't I did it?'' Following  this  lyric,  if  America
did it, what is to prevent Britain and  Spain  from  doing  it  too,  should
circumstances permit? They are aligning themselves with  America.  There  is
no doubt that Iraq will sustain severe haemorrhaging after  this  war.  This
will impact negatively on neighbouring countries  on  social,  economic  and
other grounds. Iraq will definitely need billions to reconstruct itself.  We
will pay a heavy price for the crude oil and petrol to enable Iraq to  raise
funds for its reconstruction.

Lastly, one  is  in  no  way  suggesting  that  Saddam  Hussein  is  without
mistakes. President Bush also does not have a strong case.  But  the  bottom
line is that engagement of military  force  is  barbaric  and  hostile,  and
acceptable means should be found  to  solve  the  problems.  After  all,  an
Englishman argues that there are many ways to kill a cat. [Applause.]

Ms N C KONDLO: Chairperson, before I proceed with my speech, I just want  to
correct two things that have been said by the New NP's hon Van  Niekerk  and
the ACDP's hon member Durr. Maybe the fact that  their  inputs  are  similar
reflects their historical backgrounds.  This  is  especially  because,  when
they were in power, they had no respect for human  rights.  No  wonder  they
are able to say such horrible  things  about  human  lives.  They  say  this
because they have no respect for human lives. They have reminded us  of  the
history that we come from. It is probably a pity that  they  are  benefiting
from the democracy that we fought for.

I also wish to remind the hon member Van Niekerk  that  when  he  refers  to
Saddam Hussein's violation of UN  resolutions,  he  has  forgotten,  perhaps
deliberately, how Israel has consistently  violated  UN  Resolution  69  but
continues to receive billions of dollars from America.

Let me then deal with the issues that the ANC  has  mandated  me  to  debate
upon.

Izenzo  zeMelika  ngokuqhubela  phambili  ngomlo  okanye   imfazwe   ne-Iraq
zisixelela izinto ezimbini ngayo. Okokuqala, kukuba iMelika  isoloko  ifuna,
yona  njengalizwe,   ithabathele   amanye   amazwe   isigqibo.   Okwesibini,
ukusengela phantsi imizamo yeentetho ezikhoyo kwihlabathi phakathi  kwezizwe
ngokuphathelele kule  mfazwe,  ndawonye  nokungayiboneli  ntweni  intlangano
yeZizwe eziManyeneyo  khon'  ukuze  kuviwe  ngayo,  kwenziwe  intando  yayo,
indelelo ukutsho oko. Okwesithathu,  le  ndelelo  nentswela  mbeko  yeMelika
kwiZizwe eziManyeneyo yenza ukuba ikamva leZizwe eziManyeneyo libe  mfiliba,
ngakumbi  xa  kufanele  iphathe  imicimbi  yabantu   behlabathi   ngeenjongo
zokuqinisa  imvano,  ukuqinisekisa  uxolo   ehlabathini   kunye   nenkqubela
phambili yoluntu kwihlabathi liphela.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[The actions of the US to proceed with the fight or war  against  Iraq  tell
us two things  about  the  US:  that  it,  firstly,  always  wants  to  take
decisions, as a country, on behalf of other countries; secondly, that  there
is undermining of existing peace initiatives amongst nations  in  the  world
with regard to this war, together with disregarding the UN so  that  the  US
calls the shots and things get done the  way  it  likes,  meaning  contempt.
Thirdly, this contempt and  disrespectfulness  of  America  towards  the  UN
makes the future of the UN bleak, especially with  regard  to  dealing  with
matters of the world community  with  a  view  to  strengthening  relations,
ensuring that there's peace in the world  and  there's  development  in  the
entire world community.]

To  us  this  war  will  fundamentally  reverse   the   struggle   for   the
transformation and democratisation of the  UN  and  all  other  multilateral
institutions.

Xa  sijonga  le  mfazwe  nendlela   eza   ngayo   iMelika   ngokunyanzelisa,
iyasibonisa iMelika okokukuba yintoni  eyona  ngxaki  yayo.  Siyazi  okokuba
ezoqoqosho eMelika zikhe zathanda ukugingxagingxa nokuba yekeyeke  mva  nje.
Loo  nto  ke  ibonakalisa  okokuba  iMelika,  njenge  lizwe  lobungxowankulu
nanjengabo bonke oongxowankulu, yenza nantoni  ezakuqinisekisa  into  yokuba
ingeniso abanayo yeyokuqinisekisa ubungxowankulu  bayo.  Ke  ilizwe  elifana
neMelika xa lifuna  ukuqinisekisa  ukulawula  ubungxowankulu  balo  lingenza
nantoni  na.  Kungaphalala  igazi,  abantu   bangaphulukana   nobomi   babo.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[If we look at the war and its approach of coercing, America is  showing  us
what its actual problem is. We know that, at  some  stage,  the  economy  of
America was shaky and has slackened lately. That shows that  America,  as  a
capitalist country and like all capitalists, does anything that will  ensure
that the income they have entrenches its capitalism. So when a country  like
America wants to entrench its capitalist control, it can do anything.  Blood
can be shed, people can lose their lives.]

It is in the nature of any capitalist country or society  to  live  for  any
gains, irrespective of how humankind suffers.

Masikhumbule  kwakhona  malungu  eNdlu  into  yokuba  loo  nto  ithi  sivile
kwiingxelo  ebezikhona  kutsha  nje  into  yokuba  iMelika   sele   iplanile
neenkampani ezizakuthi xa sele iphelile  imfazwe  zihambe  ziye  kungena  e-
Iraq, ziye  kuncedisa  ekwakheni  isizwe  sase-Iraq.  Ezinye  zezo  nkampani
ziinkampani ze-oli zaseMelika.  Iyasixelela  ke  loo  nto  okokuba  uyintoni
umdla weMelika e-Iraq. Ayina nto yakwenza nokuba ifuna ukumfundisa  isifundo
uSaddam Hussein nokuba makuphele izixhobo zokubulala isininzi, inomdla  kula
oli kuba kaloku iza kuphakamisa umgangatho wayo  kwezoqoqosho.  (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[Again, let us also remember, members of this House, that that  says  to  us
what we heard in recent reports,  that  the  US  has  already  planned  with
companies that will go into Iraq, after the war, to  help  build  the  Iraqi
nation. Some of those companies are America's oil companies. That tells  us,
then, what it is that is America's interest in Iraq. It has  nothing  to  do
with wanting to teach Saddam Hussein a lesson, to  get  rid  of  weapons  of
mass destruction. It is interested in that oil because  it  will  raise  the
level of its economy.]

Again, the Afghanistan experience indicated that  even  though  America  had
promised to rebuild it, on the contrary, this has never seen  the  light  of
day. Instead, the people of Afghanistan are still struggling  as  we  speak.
There are even reports of malnutrition  following  the  US  pursuit  of  the
Taliban. If indeed the Americans' interest is to protect human  rights,  why
is it that the Palestinian people are still  struggling  for  their  freedom
from Israel?

Le  mfazwe  ke,  mhlali-ngaphambili,  inemiphumela   emibi,   engathandekiyo
nengafunekiyo kukhuseleko loluntu jikelele. Le nto  icace  mhlophe  ngamazwi
athethwe ngummi wase-Iraq othe xa ethetha,  ndiyamcaphula:  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[This war, Chairperson, has ugly results that we don't  want  and  that  are
not needed for the safety of the entire society. This  is  abundantly  clear
in the words of an Iraqi citizen who said, and I quote, as follows:]


  The dangers of invasion and military occupation by the  US,  Britain  and
  their allies could only bring further  death  and  destruction.  We  have
  already endured terrible suffering as a  result  of  two  wars  waged  by
  dictatorial rulers, the Iraq-Iran war between 1980 and 1988 and the  Gulf
  War, in addition to the devastating consequences  of  years  of  economic
  sanctions.

This could depict the human suffering the people of Iraq will endure if  the
war is waged.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi ke Sihlalo, i-ANC ... [As I am  about  to  take  my
seat, Chairperson, the ANC ...]

... says no  to  war  and  yes  to  peace.  Let  us  intensify  our  antiwar
mobilisation in solidarity with the people of Iraq. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:15.
