                   CELEBRATION OF YOUTH DAY AT EZINQOLENI

                            (Member's Statement)

Nk N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU  (ANC):  Sekela  Somlomo,  umphakathi  waseZinqoleni
namaphethelo ogwini oluseNingizimu neTheku  kwaZulu-Natali  izolo  kuyilanga
lomgubho wentsha lukazwelonke uhlanganele  ezinkundleni  zemidlalo  kuyo  le
ndawo.  Lapha  intsha  ibinyathelana.   Bekukhona   nabaholi   bezinhlangano
zombusazwe ezehlukene.

Kuyathokozisa ukusho ukuthi bonke abaholi abebehambele lo  mcimbi  bakhulume
ngezwi  eliloldwa,  babeka  umyalezo  ocace  bha  othi:  Ukuthula  phambili,
intuthuko  phambili,  intsha   mayibambe   iqhaza   kuzo   zonke   ezinhlelo
zikaHulumeni zokwakha  kabusha  leli  zwe  lethu  esilithandayo.  Izikhulumi
ziphinde zagcizelela kakhulu isidingo  sokuthi  intsha  isebenzise  amathuba
avulwe yinkululeko ilwe nobuphofu.

SinguKhongolose siyayihalalisela  yonke  intsha  yalapha  ezweni  ngemigubho
yayo ebe mihle kangaka ezweni lonke. Sithi  kuyo:  Phambili  ngamavolontiya,
asakhe  ikusasa  elingcono.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu   paragraphs
follows.)

[Ms N R NTSHULANA-BHENGU (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the community of  Ezinqoleni
and surrounding areas on the south coast of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal,  gathered
at a local sportsground to celebrate National Youth Day. The youth  attended
in large numbers and there were leaders from different political parties.

It is heartening to say that all  the  leaders  who  were  present  at  this
celebration spoke in one voice which gave a crystal clear  message:  Forward
with peace, forward with development. The youth must take part  in  all  the
Government's programmes meant to transform this, our dear country.  Speakers
also stressed the need for the youth to make use of opportunities  presented
to them by the attainment of freedom to fight poverty.

As the ANC, we congratulate all the youth of this country on the  successful
celebrations nationwide. We say to them: Forward  with  volunteers,  let  us
build a better future. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: In the course of that  statement  I  became  aware  that
that was a statement, not a notice  of  motion,  so  we  will  proceed  with
statements  and  then  we  will  come  to  notices  of  motion.  Any   other
statements?

            ANOTHER DEATH IN PENSION PAYOUT QUEUE IN EASTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs G M BORMAN (DA): Deputy Speaker, yet another person has died waiting  in
a queue for a social grant payout in the Eastern Cape.

The ANC was quick to condemn the death, but their concern smacks of
hypocrisy because it is the ANC provincial government which appointed Cash
Paymaster Services (CPS) to distribute social grants, and it is the ANC
Government which should have monitored this company from the start to
ensure that they met the terms of the contract. The ANC has failed to do
so. It has failed the poorest and most helpless amongst the people of the
Eastern Cape.

Following three deaths in queues in February, the department deducted 10%
from its payment to CPS, but services have not improved. How many deaths
will the ANC accept before it enforces or terminates this contract?

The conditions under which pensioners and the disabled suffer to collect
grants are appalling. The MEC for Social Development must take
responsibility for these continued failures. She should have the courage to
acknowledge her failure and resign. If not, she should be fired.
[Interjections.]

       SOUTH AFRICAN RUNNERS' DOMINATION IN THE 2003 COMRADES MARATHON

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N S MIDDLETON (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the Comrades Marathon was run
from Pietermaritzburg to Durban yesterday, 16 June, and after being
dominated by international runners in the previous years, it was very
pleasing to see that South African athletes dominated this year's men's
race in particular.

There are six South Africans, including  the  winner  and  one  runner  from
Lesotho, who finished  in  the  top  ten  in  this  year's  men's  race.  We
congratulate Fusi Nhlapo, the winner of the 2003 Comrades Marathon, as  well
as all other South Africans who finished in the top ten of the race as  they
have made us, as South Africans, very proud.

 We further congratulate Zeph Luhabe who, at 76 years old,  was  the  oldest
man in the race and the last person to complete the race before the  cut-off
time.

Congratulations! South Africa, you have done us proud. [Applause.]

                         REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr J BENJAMIN (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, last week the Governor of the
Reserve Bank announced a 1,5% cut in interest rates. Major banking
institutions in the country followed suit by announcing reductions in their
prime lending rates as well.

We believe that the reduction in interest rates will bring about joy and
smiles on the faces of many of our debt-ridden South Africans, as well as
produce a positive spin-off to the economy and improve prospects with
regard to job creation.

We would like to take this opportunity to commend the Government of South
Africa for the responsible, correct and principled manner in which it
continues to handle the economy and finances of this country. Let the tide
continue to turn. [Applause.]

              PYRAMID SCHEMES DOUBLE IN NUMBERS IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr W A ODENDAAL (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, illegal deposit-taking
investment schemes, commonly known as pyramid schemes, have almost doubled
in numbers in South Africa over the past three years. Last year 25 such
schemes were uncovered and investigated by regulatory organs of the state.
The Kreon scandal must have acquired the dubious status of most notorious
illegal multiplication scam for 2002.

Hundreds of well-meaning residents from Southern Gauteng were fraudulently
robbed of R500-R900 million. Many victims who trusted swindlers with all
their pension money have lost everything they had. Some areas seem to be
more prone to such multilayered deposit schemes than others. The Vaal
Triangle has even earned itself the name of Nile Valley because of the
multitude of pyramid schemes that have been launched in this area in recent
times.

Members of the public are warned against these fraudsters. Anybody
suspecting any foul play from any unknown investment scheme is advised to
contact the Special Financial Intelligence Centre, recently set up by the
National Treasury in Pretoria, before they burn their fingers. [Applause.]

       CORRUPT COURT OFFICIALS POCKET MILLIONS IN MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE (ACDP): Madam Deputy Speaker, shocking findings that
scores of corrupt court officials are pocketing millions in maintenance
payments, highlight yet again the fraud and inefficiency in South Africa's
maintenance system. Although receiving child support is often an issue of
survival, particularly in rural areas, frustrated divorced and single women
face never-ending difficulties in obtaining maintenance from defaulting
husbands and fathers.

According to a recent Justice Department investigation hundreds of
thousands of fathers are not paying maintenance. In Umlazi outside Durban,
for instance, 60 000 men have maintenance orders against them, but just 8
000 fathers are actually paying. In Mitchells Plain in Cape Town only 5 000
of the 50 000 men with maintenance orders against them are paying. Even
when fathers do pay maintenance there is no guarantee that the money will
reach its intended beneficiaries.

Scores of court officials are being investigated after millions in
maintenance payments have gone missing over a period of several years.
Court administration is so shoddy that it is not even known how much money
has been stolen from the courts, because they have not been audited for
almost 50 years. Many women do not even go to the courts to get their money
because of the difficulties involved, while those who do are forced to
spend hours in long queues at magistrates courts in humiliating
circumstances.

The ACDP welcomes the appointment of 55 maintenance investigators. However,
we trust more will be appointed soon, as the present number of
investigators is insufficient. Stringent steps are needed to enforce court
orders to deduct maintenance from salaries. [Time expired.]

                            WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B M KOMPHELA (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the World Economic Forum on
Sustainable Development took place in Durban last week. Among the issues
discussed was the New Partnership for Africa's Development e-school
programme. The electronic initiative seeks to prioritise the youth for
higher intervention programmes aimed at bridging the digital divide and
building a more equitable global information society.

 That the summit also placed on its agenda issues central  to  the  role  of
the youth in the  development  of  Africa  is  commendable,  and  should  be
encouraged. These initiatives  carry  with  them  the  critically  important
prospect of harmonising education on the African continent.  The  ANC  calls
on  social  partners  to  work  tirelessly  towards  the   introduction   of
information and communication technology at all schools all over Africa.  We
have  to  address  the  problem  of  lack  of  infrastructure  that  hampers
implementation in this regard. I thank you. [Applause.]
                  POULTRY FARMING ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr M S MOGOBA (PAC): Madam Deputy Speaker, we are a nation of meat eaters,
and poultry is very high on our list of consumer needs. It is, however,
unfortunate that many large scale producers of chicken, and many small
scale farmers are closing down, as well as many abattoirs.

One factor leading to this is the high cost of feed, which has hit the
small farmers. Another fairly disturbing factor is the large quantity of
imported chicken on the market, particularly from Brazil. Foreign trade is
good for a country, but if it takes place on such a scale that it destroys
the local industry, we must raise the alarm that this might be a short-term
convenience which is short-sighted and dangerous to the development of the
country. This we feel calls for urgent investigation and review. Thank you.

                     INTERNATIONAL GRANT TO FORTIFY FOOD
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, the Global Alliance for
Improved Nutrition, a global alliance of public, private and civic sector
organisations, among others Unicef, Bill and Melinda Gates, the World Bank
and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN, has approved a grant
worth $2,8 million to South Africa to fortify maize and wheat flour.

In the light of the fact that maize and wheat flour form the staple diet of
the majority of poor households in this country, and also that the serious
risk of malnutrition amongst children is estimated at around 25%, food
fortification programmes and other measures with similar intent could
provide the cheapest way to improve the lives of the poor. We thank the
Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition for its generous grant, and call
upon all humanity to work to eradicate malnutrition amongst the children of
the world. I thank you. [Applause.]

                      CRIME STATISTICS MUST BE RELEASED

                            (Member's Statement)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION (DA): Deputy Speaker, what does the hon
Minister of Safety and Security have to hide? He believes Parliament and
the people cannot be trusted with the news about crime, Big Brother will
decide for us. He responded to my request for crime figures by saying three
things. Firstly, he says the request was initialled and not signed.
Secondly, some of the figures for earlier years are already available.
Thirdly, he will release this year's figures next August.

What he hasn't done is to explain his refusal to release figures now. Why
is he so hysterical about this? He has held these figures for months and
South Africans live in a democracy, they are entitled to know the facts.
[Interjections.] Go and read the Constitution; MPs need to know before the
budget voting next Tuesday. If we are to tackle crime and bring it under
control, we need to know the truth and to face the facts.
The hon Minister can now choose, if he wants support for his budget he must
take MPs, and the people of this country, into his confidence. [Applause.]

                       ESCAPE OF PRISONERS FROM COURTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Deputy Speaker, the IFP is particularly concerned
about the rate of escapes from courts in South Africa. Prisoners and
suspects attending court proceedings are under the supervision of the SA
Police Service, therefore SAPS members at courts have the responsibility to
safeguard awaiting-trial prisoners.

During the last few years hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoners escaped
from police custody at court buildings. In many cases it has been proven
that escapes were purely due to negligence, whereas some escapes took place
with the help of SAPS members. We are particularly concerned about an
escape that took place at Eshowe court last week. A murder suspect in a
well-publicised case, the suspect being a certain Mr Zulu, escaped far too
easily for us to believe that the police did not assist him. At the very
least, it was an act of gross negligence.

 After escaping from the dock, instead of the police, a female prosecutor
gave chase, with police personnel giving chase afterwards. The reason for
only joining the chase afterwards was that they first needed to get their
firearms. We urge the Minister of Safety and Security to investigate the
escape in question as a matter of urgency. We believe that there is more to
this escape than meets the eye.

                            MA DE BRUIN HONOURED

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M P MENTOR (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, Ma De Bruin of Pabalelo,
Upington in the Northern Cape, was a death row prisoner and was one of the
Upington 26 who were found guilty on the basis of common purpose for
allegedly killing a policeman in Pabalelo at the height of the resistance
to apartheid in the eighties.

She later got a stay of execution and was eventually released from prison
with other political prisoners. She testified to the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission as a survivor of a gross human rights violation
by the apartheid state. The provincial government of the Northern Cape will
be honouring Ma De Bruin in a two-day Mokete waThabo, which will take place
on 28 and 29 June in Upington. She will then also receive her RDP house,
which has additional fittings, like a geyser, ceramic tiles, a ceiling, a
bathroom, bedrooms and a garage. All these additional fittings were made
possible by patriotic white businesspeople in the Northern Cape who are
keen to come to the party of reparation.

Other death-row trialists like the famous Delmas trialists and those who
were involved in the Save the Patriots campaign and other MDM structures
are also invited so that we should never forget. Thank you. [Applause.]

                   SUPPORT FOR BY-ELECTION IN STELLENBOSCH

                            (Member's Statement)

Mev M E OLCKERS (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, die Nuwe NP verwelkom
die steun wat deur onder andere Dr Esther Lategan, wat 'n paar jaar gelede
medestigter was van die Nasionale Demokratiese Beweging, mnre Jan Boland
Coetzee, Beyers Truter, Francois Malan en Jean Engelbrecht, almal
wêreldbekende wynmakers, en mnr Albert Nothnagel, 'n voormalige ambassadeur
in Nederland, uitgespreek is in 'n koerantadvertensie ter steuning van mnr
Nick van Rensburg, Nuwe NP-kandidaat in die tussenverkiesing wat Woensdag,
dus môre, in Wyk 5 in Stellenbosch gehou word. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Hierdie gebaar is weer eens 'n bewys dat denkende mense met 'n visie
samewerkende regering in Suid-Afrika steun. Hierdie is persone met 'n
wêreldwye reputasie en invloed. Hulle wil saam bou met die Nuwe NP en die
ANC om hierdie land die skitterende juweel van vreedsame naasbestaan op die
kontinent te maak. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Hulle weet dat ons saam kan wen. Hulle besef en glo dat die politiek
inklusief en nie isolerend moet wees nie. Ons in die Nuwe NP is trots om
met mense soos hulle geassosieer te word. [Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Madam Deputy Speaker, the New NP welcomes the support given by, amongst
others, Dr Esther Lategan, who was co-founder of the National Democratic
Movement a few years ago, Messrs Jan Boland Coetzee, Beyers Truter,
Francois Malan and Jean Engelbrecht, all world-renowned wine makers, and Mr
Albert Nothnagel, a former ambassador to the Netherlands, as expressed in a
newspaper advertisement in support of Mr Nick van Rensburg, the New NP
candidate in the by-election in Stellenbosch which is to take place on
Wednesday, that is tomorrow, in Ward 5 in Stellenbosch. [Interjections.]

This gesture is once again proof that thinkers with a vision support co-
operative governance in South Africa. They are people of international
reputation and influence. Together they want to work with the New NP and
the ANC to make of this country a shining jewel of peaceful co-existence on
the continent. [Interjections.]

They know that together we can win. They realise and believe that politics
should be inclusive and not isolationary. We in the New NP are proud to be
associated with people such as them. [Applause.]]

                 CONDOLENCES TO UDM PRESIDENT BANTU HOLOMISA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Deputy Speaker, the UDM extends its deepest and most
sincere condolences to the UDM's President, Bantu Holomisa, and his wife on
the passing away of their daughter Nomsa. Nomsa was 21 years old and passed
away during the early hours of Sunday, 15 June, Father's Day.

 With one so young, with her life stretching out before her, words fail to
describe the loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Holomisa family.
We hope that you will find consolation in this time of bereavement. I thank
you.

   RESPONSE TO EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION FOR YOUTH, AND TO OTHER MATTERS
                                   RAISED

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Deputy Speaker, I am responding to
three questions.

Firstly, I would like to say to the hon Ruth Bhengu that there is so much
that we need to express appreciation for to the youth. Indeed, our history
is replete with instances in which the youth made very fundamental
interventions which, among other things, brought us to where we are today.

In 1944 the ANC established the ANC Youth League. By 1949 that structure
had formulated a strategy that was designed to give impetus to the
programme of the liberation of our country. Indeed, when 1976 came around,
it was again the youth that provided the spark that the ANC's programmes,
particularly its military programme, needed.

Of course, even ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order?

Mr M J ELLIS: On what issue is the hon Minister advising on matters ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members. The hon member has the right
to raise ...

Mr M J ELLIS: The hon Minister is not the Minister in the Presidency who
normally talks on youth affairs. It is not at all clear why this Minister
is rising to speak on this particular point.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, please let the Minister finish. He is
responding to an issue raised by the hon Ruth Bhengu.

Mr M J ELLIS: Yes, Deputy Speaker, but as far as I understand, the hon
Bhengu raised a point about youth and Youth Day. I do not understand why
this hon Minister is responding to that issue.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, this is at the discretion of the Chair, so
let the Minister finish his statement.

Mr M J ELLIS: But, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have a ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, I am not arguing with you on this matter.
Please take your seat.

Mr M J ELLIS: ... we have a set of rules, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is in
our rules. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, please take your seat and  let  the  Minister
...

Mr M J ELLIS: With much reluctance, Madam Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Ellis, you either take your seat or  you  leave  the
House. [Interjections.]

Please finish, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: At this point, Madam Deputy Speaker,
it is once more the youth who are saying that they have a good programme
that is going to take our people to a better future - to fight against all
the ills that we have, and to fight against crime and the other ills we
still have to fight.

I really wish to appeal to the DA: Please help the hon Douglas Gibson. The
hon Douglas Gibson sent me a letter requesting statistics. He was
requesting statistics for 2000, 2001 and 2002. I've responded to this. Now,
he comes here to this House and he changes the very contents of that
requesting letter. He is now saying that he wants statistics and questions
why I am not releasing statistics, but he asked for specific statistics.

I am going to assist the hon Gibson with the statistics he wants,
particularly because in his hurry to grab the headlines the other day he
forgot to sign the requesting letter that he submitted to my office.
[Laughter.] Now, he has another opportunity in which he can again make
another request and tell me exactly what statistics he needs, and I will
respond on that basis. He must indicate exactly what statistics he needs.

Then there's the matter of the escape that occurred, a matter which the hon
Ferreira raised. He's correct - we are going to investigate. Quite clearly,
from what he has said, something very wrong took place there. I would be
pleased if he would supply us with just the initial information in order
for us to conduct the necessary investigation. Thank you. [Applause.]

                                 E-EDUCATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Hon Deputy Speaker, may I assure you that this
is not the Mutt and Jeff show, because the Minister of Safety and Security
and I invariably appear. I thank the hon Mr Komphela for his statement on
the World Economic Forum and the emphasis on e-school programmes. Two
features are important here. First, the co-operation between South Africa
and the rest of Africa in the Nepad programme in e-education is enormously
important, and the World Economic Forum recognises that.

We recognise, also, the remarkable degree of optimism the World Economic
Forum had - from business, from politicians, from social scientists - about
the future of South Africa and its role in Africa. So, we will assist in
this by producing a White Paper on e-education which we are about to submit
to Cabinet.

First of all, we shall submit the White Paper on exactly what we mean by
the type of e-education in our schools, and how one rolls out this
programme, especially in the context of developments in the
telecommunications area in which additional licences are to be granted.

The second aspect concerns higher education. Some African countries have no
higher education institutions or structures. That is why we are taking the
initiative in terms of Nepad to call, at the beginning of next year, the
first ever African conference on e-education, dealing with distance
education.

South Africa has an important role to play, not as a coloniser, not as a
profit-maker, but as a provider of assistance to our sister African
countries on how they can use e-education in terms of broadcasting and in
terms of getting access to the rural areas, averting the capital
developments necessary. We are going to work very closely with the
University of SA and, of course, with Unesco in organising this conference.
The spill-over effect will be felt not only in higher education, but in the
training of teachers as well.

I conclude by saying that we cannot supply computers and connectivity and
leave it for the schools and universities themselves. These then become
toys, toys that become disused. We must train teachers, as the first
essential factor, so that teachers use the computer as a genuine teaching
aid, not as a crutch to lean on. Too many computers are supplied by
companies and government departments, but no training is supplied to
teachers. We don't want to use e-education as a substitute for contact
between teachers and pupils, but the training of teachers is vital to this.

I thank the hon Komphela for bringing this to the attention of the House.
We will be taking, as the Department of Education, important initiatives in
this area. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

             NUTRITION AND THE IMPORTATION OF BRAZILIAN POULTRY

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Deputy President, on the
issue that was raised ... [Interjections.] Deputy Speaker, I am sorry about
that. Maybe, next time you will be one. [Interjections.]

I want to thank the member for raising the issue regarding the Global
Alliance for Improved Nutrition. As Government, we are glad about this
gesture, because it fits in with our own integrated food security and
nutrition programme which was adopted by Cabinet last year. Among other
things, it deals with issues of nutrition and how we could complement that,
not just in terms of production, but also to ensure that minerals that are
essential in food content, but which are lost during the production cycle,
can actually be fortified. So, the Department of Health has been working
with the Department of Agriculture and the industry to see how we could
improve at that level. We are very glad that the international organisation
has actually come to the assistance of the Government programme in this
regard.

Regarding the issue of the poultry problem, as raised by the hon Mogoba, we
have been made aware of the challenge that the poultry industry faces. But
the challenge that the poultry industry faces is a challenge that faces the
livestock farmers in general around the issues of input costs.

The issues that relate to imports of Brazilian chickens, or any other
chickens, is a matter that does raise issues of the challenges for South
Africa's agricultural sector in terms of its competitiveness worldwide, and
also how, in our view, we use the structures that Government have put in
place such as the Board on Tariffs and Trade, the Department of Trade and
Industry, and the Department of Agriculture.

You would recall that at some stage when there was a problem regarding
American chickens we were able, as Government, to work with the industry to
deal with that challenge. I am sure that in this instance if the poultry
industry was to indicate what the problems are with regard to the imports
of chickens from Brazil, we can deal with the issues pertaining to that. Is
it because they feel that the tariffs are too low or too high or because
there is a subsidy involved? Thank you. [Applause.]

               CHILD MAINTENANCE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I thought Dr Motsoko Pheko
was here because I wanted to congratulate him, but I will deal with that
later. [Laughter.]

On the issue of maintenance, I think it is important that we  must  realise,
as Government, that there are issues which we can deal with by  way  of  law
and arrest. But there are issues that we cannot deal with in that way.  With
regard to the issue of maintenance, Government has processes  through  which
people are able to appeal to the courts. The mothers of children  appeal  to
the courts and the courts then, of  course,  pass  judgments  through  which
people are ordered to look after their children. Beyond  that,  where  there
is no such situation, there are social  welfare  programmes  where  children
who are without proper maintenance are accommodated.

The issue of moral regeneration comes in here. I think that the ACDP  should
really take this seriously. I am referring more to the  hon  Rhoda  who  has
dealt with this issue. There is a need to tackle the problem  at  the  level
of social values and norms, to educate  people.  Parents  must  be  able  to
recognise the fact that they don't need to be arrested to look  after  their
children, because if we lock them up in prisons  there  will  be  nobody  to
earn money to pay  for  the  children.  So,  everything  has  been  done  by
Government in this area. What is outstanding is the cultivation of  men  and
women who recognise their responsibility in relation to their  families  and
especially towards their children. Thank you. [Applause.]

       CONGRATULATIONS TO FUSI NHLAPO ON WINNING THE COMRADES MARATHON

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  yesterday, on 16 June 2003, Fusi Nhlapo, a runner from the  Free
           State, won the 2003 Comrades Marathon from  Pietermaritzburg  to
           Durban; and


       (b)  Nhlapo's win emphasised the dominance of South Africans in  this
           marathon as they took seven of the top ten positions;


  (2) believes that  the  courageous  efforts  by  our  athletes  yesterday
       deserve a great round of national  applause  as  it  exemplifies  the
       spiritual, mental and physical  resilience  that  should,  and  does,
       constitute the defining feature of the character  of  our  nation  in
       transition, continually seeking to extricate itself from the doldrums
       of racist sterility, and consistently seeking to redefine its destiny
       as a beacon of the victory of the human spirit of ubuntu;


  (3) congratulates Fusi Nhlapo, and the rest of  South  Africa's  team  of
       runners  on  their  sterling  performance  in  this  year's  Comrades
       Marathon; and


  (4) is of the opinion that this beautiful victory by our athletes further
       demonstrates that we are indeed on course in making this  an  African
       century.

Agreed to.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1)

[THE CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move  without
notice:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the Mining Titles Registration Amendment Bill [B  24  -
  2003] (National Assembly - sec 75) before three working days have elapsed
  since the committee's report was tabled.]

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 8 - National Treasury (Intelligence):

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Before the  Minister  starts  addressing  the  House,  I
would like to  recognise  the  hon  former  Minister  of  Intelligence,  Joe
Nhlanhla, who is sitting  in  the  House  at  the  back  there.  [Applause.]
Welcome, hon member.

The MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE: Madam Deputy Speaker, members, have you  ever
wondered why the taxi violence stopped? And  what  about  terrorism  in  the
Western Cape? Funny how we always notice things when they go  wrong,  rather
than when they go right.

A group of dedicated people is working to make our country  a  safer  place,
investigating crimes like corruption, terrorism and sabotage;  things  you'd
definitely notice if they did happen. So, the  next  time  an  ordinary  day
goes by, don't forget just how extraordinary it is.

Here we are, another  ordinary  day,  brought  about  by  the  extraordinary
efforts of the intelligence community securing you  -  unseen,  unknown  and
unacknowledged.

Today's  budget  is  dedicated  to  the  youth  of  South  Africa  who   are
represented here by a group of young  aspirant  intelligence  officers  from
the nine provinces, chosen because of their  excellence.  They  are  sitting
over there. [Applause.] We are also joined  here  by  the  veterans  of  the
intelligence  community   who,   through   the   years,   unknown,   unseen,
unacknowledged, have made it possible for you and I to sit  here  today  and
enjoy another ordinary day. May I welcome these people here. [Applause.]

About 10 weeks ago, maybe 11, my services provided me with  an  analysis  of
the Iraqi war. Their conclusion was sharp. This was  two  weeks  before  the
invasion into Baghdad. They said to me that Baghdad would fall within a  few
days with the minimum of resistance. This was  so  at  odds  with  what  was
playing itself out on the television news on a daily basis that  it  sounded
rather preposterous, even to me. What, no resistance from Baghdad?  Why,  on
a daily basis there was the then Iraqi Minister of  Information,  a  feisty,
spirited  fellow,  by  any  account,  looking  confident  and  convincing  -
convincing you, convincing me. It could not  possibly  be  that  they  would
surrender without any resistance.

The prognosis of our intelligence services could not be  out  of  sync  with
reality. They were adamant though, and as they sketched out the reasons  why
they  believed  that  this  was  the  conclusion,  it  sounded   even   more
preposterous. ``You are certainly not taking that to Cabinet,''  I  said  to
them. Their answer was simple: ``Minister, trust us,  have  we  ever  misled
you?'' Trust? The very word settled it for me, because indeed I trust  them.
That word, so underrated within our present context of governance,  and  yet
so very crucial for  our  services.  I  regard  myself  as  one  very  lucky
Minister. I trust my services. [Applause.]

I trust them, the same kind of trust that I dream I can  help  to  establish
between  the  services  and  South  African  citizens  so  we  can  build  a
partnership with society that is  built  on  trust,  for  the  good  of  our
country. I trust their analyses, both foreign and  domestic,  because  these
have proved in the past to be solid and reliable, the  kind  that  lays  the
basis for credibility.

I was not at that Cabinet meeting,  otherwise  I  would  not  be  recounting
this. I hope it did take place. I'll ask the Minister of Home Affairs if  it
did, or maybe the Minister of Defence. However, I  amuse  myself  trying  to
conjure up the disbelief of my colleagues as they  were  told  that  Baghdad
would surrender without any resistance. The rest is  history.  Baghdad  fell
with not much resistance, and the reasons the services  gave  me  are  those
that are now common currency.

Our intelligence services are maturing into a reliable  and  most  effective
instrument of security of our time. I have journeyed  across  the  land  and
seen the enthusiasm of our sons  and  daughters  beckoning  to  us  to  take
extreme pride in the steps  we  have  taken  from  the  time  we  proclaimed
ourselves a free people. I have  also  seen  the  positive  results  of  the
impact of the resources, albeit very inadequate, that  we  plough  into  the
services each year.

I can confidently assert that  the  intelligence  community  is  a  credible
guarantor of security, stability and peace for our people and  our  country.
It has integrity; and a composition that  reflects  our  principle  goal  of
creating an open, nonsexist and nonracial democratic South Africa. Over  the
last  nine  years  we  have  traversed   a   very   difficult   terrain   of
transformation,  navigating  the   convoluted   process   of   striking   an
appropriate balance  between  representivity  and  competence,  and  finally
emerged as one of  the  most  able  and  competitive  intelligence  services
within the global intelligence community. Without fear of  contradiction,  I
can say here and now that we are one  of  the  most  completely  transformed
entities of this Government.

I say this as a reflection of the progress we have made since we tabled  the
last budget vote for the intelligence services. In the year under review  we
have implemented  the  most  realistic  strategic  objectives  that  we  set
ourselves. To repeat what has now become a common realisation in  the  light
of globalisation and the emergence of new global security  threats,  despite
some setbacks, intelligence fulfils an unprecedented historic role  for  the
progress and development of all nations of the world.

I am happy to report that the work of the co-ordination of the  intelligence
of various departments is steadily bearing fruit, and you can  see  that  by
the very presence  of  my  colleagues,  the  Minister  of  Defence  and  the
Minister of Safety and Security.

Co-ordinating  the  work  of  our  intelligence  services   is   a   crucial
responsibility for me. Buttressed by the re-enforced power of  the  National
Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee,  co-operation  between  the  civilian,
defence and crime intelligence services  has  increased  with  the  pleasant
result  that  the  quality   of   our   annual   assessment   has   improved
significantly. In fact,  for  the  first  time,  our  assessment  this  year
received an excellent rating from the security cluster.

I must take this opportunity, therefore, to congratulate the  heads  of  our
crime and defence intelligence for the quality of the assessment. I have  to
add, however, that I've already congratulated  the  heads  of  the  civilian
services. [Applause.]

I believe that the quality of intelligence is determined by the  quality  of
the policy-maker. As the intelligence community  is  challenged  to  provide
information to policy-makers who are informed about their  surroundings,  we
have to ensure that the quality of our work can rise  above  their  frequent
probes and provide them with value and quality.

We have similarly made remarkable achievements in the  introduction  of  the
issue of maritime security during the period of  reporting.  The  matter  of
maritime security introduced a new, important and exciting  element  in  our
fold. During the period of reporting we have  also  managed  to  provide  an
integrated departmental contribution, which was prepared by South Africa  as
an official response to the United Nations Security Council.

One of our core functions is to fight  against  any  threat  to  the  state.
There is no greater resource for  this  than  the  people  of  South  Africa
themselves. It is in recognition of  the  fact  that  the  people  of  South
Africa have struggled to build the democracy we live in that I am  convinced
we would continue to struggle to protect the democracy we have.  Our  people
are our greatest asset, and we  intend  to  harness  that  resource  in  the
pursuit of one of our  core  functions,  which  is  our  counterintelligence
mandate - a critical function to enhance security and an imperative  to  the
stability and development of any country.

A number of activities  to  counter  threats  of  espionage,  terrorism  and
sabotage are performed by the services. The  objective  is  to  establish  a
state of security surrounding the personnel, information and assets  of  the
state. Identifying the loopholes in the security system is perhaps a  better
way of explaining this function.

In line with our  continued  interdepartmental  co-operation,  the  National
Intelligence Agency has established a counterintelligence  forum  comprising
itself, the SA Secret Service, the SAPS Division of Crime  Intelligence  and
the SANDF Division of Defence Intelligence. This forum has identified  seven
broad priority areas of interest, informed by our threat  perception.  These
are:  political  intelligence;  terrorism;  economic  intelligence;  counter
intelligence;  border  intelligence;  organised  crime;  drug   trafficking;
corruption and special events.

As  part  of  this  counterintelligence  campaign,  we  will  run  awareness
programmes aimed at bringing  a  national  security  responsibility  message
home to all South Africans. The message will  be:  You  are  the  key  to  a
secure South Africa. It will also mark the launch of a toll-free number  for
the NIA, for the people to  volunteer  and  provide  information  and  raise
national security.

For this purpose we will be giving every MP a coffee mug,  because  we  know
how much coffee you drink. As you pour your hot water into  the  mug,  there
will be a message there for you, reminding you on a regular basis  that  you
have the responsibility for your own intelligence. [Applause.] [Laughter.]

We have identified one clear  and  threatening  danger,  cyber  threat.  The
world is increasingly dependent on  computer  networks  for  transportation,
public  safety,  energy,  communication  -  you  name  it.  This  makes  for
increasingly vulnerable governments,  unless  we  build,  as  we  grow,  the
necessary infrastructure to protect our systems against any  possible  cyber
threat. At the moment we remain vulnerable.

When you consider  that  computers  are  less  expensive  than  conventional
weapons, more readily available  and  their  ability  for  connectivity  and
penetration swift, then you  realise  that  the  scale  of  the  problem  is
amazing. It is amazing precisely because these instruments are available  to
criminals and terrorists. What this demands of us  is  that  we  maintain  a
supreme advantage in key technologies. It is for this purpose that  we  have
established the electronic  communication  security  company  called  Comsec
(Pty) Ltd, a company charged with  the  responsibility  to  develop  cutting
edge electronics communications technology and secure our communication.

One of the first tasks of the company would be to  conduct  security  audits
to prioritise Government departments at provincial and  local  levels.  This
is a strategic intervention which will also ensure that e-commerce in  South
Africa and e-governance can thrive without difficulty and threats  posed  by
intrusion, cyber crime or cyber sabotage.

Alongside the creation of a secure  electronics  communications  environment
for state organs, is a need  to  uproot  cyber  criminals  who  seek  refuge
through the use of sophisticated encryption devices. To unmask them  and  to
expose their criminal and unpatriotic plans, we will set up the  offices  of
interception centres. I must make it unequivocally clear that these  centres
will be solely  targeted  at  those  who  seek  to  undermine  our  national
security, commit crimes and steal and sell strategic  information  belonging
to the country.

The  interception  centres  will  interface  with   the   telecommunications
operators to provide law enforcement agencies only with  judiciary  approved
interception products and services, as approved by  Parliament  through  the
Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-
related Information Act, Act 70 of 2002.
At this point, may I just indicate that we are particularly concerned  about
the proliferation of private intelligence companies, which  have  tended  to
pose as private security companies or risk management consultants.  We  have
discovered, over the years, that these companies have had unlimited  access,
paid for, to banking details, health details and personal  details  held  at
the Department of Home Affairs. This  was  a  blatant  infringement  of  the
constitutional rights of the citizens of this  country.  We  have  concluded
that there is a need to tighten  our  laws  around  this,  in  a  clear  and
precise manner.

Let me first indicate that former members of the intelligence  services  are
restricted from taking part in any of these activities by  the  Intelligence
Services Act of 2002. Secondly, the  private  security  companies  that  are
involved   in   intelligence   activities   like   private    investigation,
manufacturing, possession  of  and  selling  interception  devices  have  to
register with the Security Industry Regulatory Board, which falls under  the
political supervision of the Minister of Safety and  Security  in  terms  of
the Security Industry Act of 2001.

The new Interception Act of 2002 prohibits  the  manufacturing,  possession,
selling and use of  interception  devices.  The  only  structures  that  can
manufacture, possess or sell these devices are the law enforcement  agencies
themselves and those private security companies registered in terms  of  the
Security Industry Act. These authorised groups can intercept  communications
for the sole purposes of combating crime  and  the  provision  of  emergency
services. Any other person who  engages  in  private  security  intelligence
work outside the provision of these three laws commits a crime.

Intelligence is  a  secret  state  activity  to  understand  any  threat  to
national security, and  thereafter  to  advise  policy-makers  on  steps  to
counteract such threat. It is an  activity  performed  by  officers  of  the
state for state purposes only. Secret collection,  the  use  of  information
that is not publicly available, are the  constitutive  elements  that  would
distinguish this from other intellectual activity.

Having given this broad definition of intelligence, it should  be  clear  to
all that there is no  scope  here  for  private  intelligence  activity  for
purposes of gain or profit. We are moving swiftly to outlaw any vestiges  of
such activity.

At this point I want to  offer  a  word  of  advice  to  any  members  here,
especially from the DA, who will not be coming back to the House next  year,
not  to  try   going   into   the   business   of   intelligence   activity.
[Interjections.] Try some other  venture  instead.  And  I  see  Dene  Smuts
cackling away; she can join an estate agency. That is the way  to  go  ,  if
you will not be coming back definitely not in  intelligence  activity.  That
is a very dangerous terrain to traverse. [Interjections.]

In all of this, our concerns refer to the protection of  the  constitutional
rights to privacy of South African citizens. When state organs  infringe  on
these rights, it is not for  profit  and  that  activity  is  very  strictly
governed by a number of laws. For  example,  should  the  services  want  to
intercept anyone's telephone conversation, they have to  apply  to  a  judge
and prove that they have sufficient reason to believe that this  has  to  be
done in the national interest, and that the privacy of the  individual  will
be given the necessary protection.  Secondly,  the  Parliamentary  Oversight
Committee  on  Intelligence  has  a   supervisory   authority   over   those
responsible  for  granting  such  access  and  powers   of   scrutiny   over
applications from Intelligence Services.

It has been necessary to provide  these  details  so  that  members  of  the
public  can  appreciate  the  checks  and  balances  that  our  Intelligence
Services are subjected to. Unfortunately these laws do not appear to  govern
the  operations  of  private  intelligence  companies  who,   as   we   have
discovered, will pay to access data that infringe on the personal  lives  of
South African citizens. We have, therefore, resolved to put an end  to  this
mindless invasion of privacy.

Our delivery machinery is focused on providing a  comprehensive  package  of
security and stability. In doing this, we are convinced  that  with  such  a
package both Parliament and Government will be placed in a  better  position
to   deal   effectively   with   complex   issues,   both   nationally   and
internationally and in a  sustainable  way.  Therefore,  together  with  the
tightening of the law on private intelligence  companies,  we  are  bringing
before Parliament an amendment of the General Intelligence Law, which  seeks
to keep our delivery machinery watertight and  clear  up  technical  hitches
which we have experienced in our current laws.

In the light of the forever changing  objective  environment  in  which  our
Intelligence Services compete and operate, it is  necessary  to  review  our
national security policy, and to ensure  that  we  strive  towards  national
consensus on its meaning, our response to national security threats and  the
roles and mandates of  our  structures,  ranging  from  law  enforcement  to
security services. This process will be linked with the  Intelligence  White
Paper review process that I announced last year.
The  two  processes  will  lead  to  the  update  of  the  White  Paper   on
Intelligence. This will be done  in  accordance  with  global  and  domestic
security developments  and  challenges;  the  global  security  dispensation
indicates that the nature of security and the international  approaches  and
responses to  security  have  shifted.  The  security  problems  beyond  our
borders have become our own problems.  The  global  security  considerations
have changed considerably over the  last  three  years,  and  therefore  our
understanding of security issues must reflect these changes.

The review of the White Paper on Intelligence will be  a  collective  effort
involving a partnership  between  Government  and  the  public.  We  have  a
collective responsibility to ensure a peaceful and secure South  Africa.  We
will therefore invite all organs of state and members  of  society  to  make
their voices heard in this process. Its outcome will be a collective  vision
that will direct Government and the general  public  on  how  to  create  an
environment of peace and stability  and  the  role  and  function  that  our
Intelligence Services will have to play in that process.

Our focus must be to provide  a  comprehensive  framework  that  deals  with
security  and  stability,  broadly  incorporating  measures  of  accelerated
socioeconomic  transformation.  Civil  society,  therefore,  will  play   an
important role in the redefinition of national security. We call  upon  them
to be actively involved in the process of  reshaping  the  White  Paper.  We
want  to  appeal,  very  directly,  to  each  and  every  South  African  to
understand that the security  of  this  country  is  in  their  hands;  very
literally for MPs, the mug will be in your hands, reminding you  daily  that
this is your responsibility.

Meanwhile,  we  have  given  the  intelligence   community   new   strategic
capabilities, introduced more policy tools for efficiency and  effectiveness
and created additional and  new  control  mechanisms  for  the  purposes  of
institutional accountability. We  have  done  so  by  processing  four  Acts
through Parliament  last  year,  which  were  necessary  for  us  to  ensure
compliance with the laws of the land as  we  restructure  to  meet  our  new
challenges. Taken together, these Acts promote the principle  of  integrated
and  co-operative  governance,  especially   within   the   Justice,   Crime
Prevention and  Security  Cluster,  which  is  key  in  countering  national
security threats.

This year we launched the South African  National  Academy  of  Intelligence
(SANAI) and opened the Mzwandile Piliso Campus in Mafikeng on  28  February.
The academy  is  responsible  for  providing  training  to  members  of  the
intelligence community and other related  departments.  This  training  will
include conducting research to supplement the training function.  This  will
be an institution of excellence that will  contribute  to  the  delivery  of
quality intelligence services, which are  key  in  informing  the  decision-
making processes of Government. The academy will  contribute  to  conducting
and  commissioning  independent,  relevant   and   quality   research   that
disseminates information on the theory  and  practice  of  the  intelligence
community through our own networks.
The academy is already involved in the management and  running  of  a  cadet
programme which seeks to bring into the intelligence community the  best  of
the best amongst the youth - a sample of which we have with  us  today.  The
cadet programme will be driven by a systematic process of  talent  spotting,
head hunting, and focused and dedicated training  of  our  young  people  to
bring much needed skills into the intelligence community.

We hope that through this process of the  cadet  programme  we  will  ensure
that never again will  there  be  a  skills  shortage  in  our  intelligence
services. This is the only viable way to guarantee systematic  replenishment
of loss of skills  in  the  light  of  the  inevitable  process  of  natural
attrition.

Last year I indicated that I would  be  establishing  a  classification  and
declassification review committee. In keeping with  this  announcement,  the
committee has been set up, and the following distinguished  academics,  here
with us today, constitute its membership.
The eminent Prof Ben Magubane is the chairperson; an eminent  scholar,  Prof
Norman Levy, of the University of the Western Cape is a member; the  eminent
Prof Paulus Zulu of the University of Natal is another  member;  and  so  is
the  learned  Adv  Jennifer  Hutchinson-Wild.  [Applause.]   These   eminent
scholars are themselves individuals who are concerned that we conclude  this
work so that they themselves, and other academics, can have access  to  some
of the information that we hold. We are certain that before the end of  this
year we will have completed the work that is underway.

This review committee is responsible for developing  new  criteria  for  the
management and protection of access to information. It seeks to ensure  that
the various laws speak to one another  as  one  business  process,  starting
from access, then protection, up to the storage of information.

I must also add that one of the main challenges in this  regard  relates  to
putting in place  a  review  process  and  mechanism  to  appraise  existing
classified  records  in  order  to  consider  them   for   reclassification,
declassification and access. To this end,  the  review  committee  has  made
great progress following its inception. It  has  reviewed  existing  policy,
received public input  and  representation  on  their  terms  of  reference,
consulted with various stakeholders, and collected data for their work.

The review committee, in doing its work, has kept regular contact  with  the
public. From the outset the public was informed through  the  media  on  how
the committee was going to do its work. This was  followed  up  by  a  media
advertisement  inviting  members  of  the  public   to   make   submissions.
Furthermore,  individuals  and  organisations  were  invited  to  brief  the
committee on specific topics.  A  research  project  on  international  best
practice has been completed, and a variety of submissions received from  the
public have already been scrutinised.

From the progress report furnished by the review  committee,  I  noted  that
most people want a  comprehensive  audit  of  the  pre-1994  records  to  be
conducted, and for the Protection of Information Act of 1982 to be  replaced
with a new  law.  We  support  this  desire,  which  is  receiving  the  Law
Commission's attention.

There  has  been  a  great  deal  of  controversy  around   the   issue   of
declassification, especially given the fact that one of these areas  relates
to TRC files. Opinions have been expressed that  the  intelligence  services
are in breach of the Promotion  of  Access  to  Information  Act  over  this
matter. Let me take this opportunity to put it on record that nothing  could
be further from the truth. We have the most liberal  laws  applying  to  the
intelligence services compared to any other country in the world.

As we discharge our duties, our laws compel us to balance the disclosure  of
information with appropriate measures  that  secure  the  wellbeing  of  the
State, Government and its people. We are aware that  access  to  information
cultivates a culture  of  participation  in  democratic  processes  and  the
actualisation of human rights of the citizens which are  the  foundation  of
our Constitution. But let me hasten to add  that  democratic  accountability
of this type goes hand in hand with  responsibility,  and  our  task  is  to
ensure that we do not succumb to the populism of  those  who  have  ulterior
motives.

I indicated last year that we would be setting up an  intelligence  services
council on conditions  of  service.  This  has  been  established,  and  the
councillors are here with us today. They are Dr Sigxashe,  Mr  Dick  Knollys
and Mr Mike Louw, who is a part-time councillor. All of these have been,  at
one time or another, DGs of the Intelligence Services, and are very able  in
discharging  their  responsibilities.  I  am  sure  that  they   will   move
decisively to make the intelligence  community  the  best  employer  in  the
Public Service, leading us to the realisation of our vision  of  making  our
members intelligence cadres for life and patriots  par  excellence.  I  note
that the Minister for the Public Service and Administration has left. I  was
about to say: `` Eat your heart out.''

The Presidential Support Unit, which was established  in  November  2001  to
support the presidency in  the  prevention,  management  and  resolution  of
conflicts on the continent and elsewhere, has proved to be a very  effective
tool in support of foreign affairs. This unit not only  complements  foreign
affairs,  it  also  complements  Nicoc,   the   intelligence   co-ordination
mechanism.

As we look back on a very productive year, we  have  been  able  to  greatly
enhance the capacity of our intelligence services. This capacity  should  be
able  to  ensure  that  the   intelligence   community   carries   out   its
constitutional role with  efficiency  and  integrity,  in  the  areas  where
additional resources  have  been  received.  However,  we  still  face  some
challenges. For instance, in the fight against international  terrorism,  we
need to  maintain  the  kind  of  level-headedness  that  assures  that  our
integrity remains intact.

Our achievements could not have been realised were it not for  the  sterling
work of the  management  of  the  intelligence  community  in  changing  the
mindset of the general membership of the  intelligence  services.  This  has
been the  critical  basis  on  which  we  could  build  a  new  intelligence
community that upholds our Constitution, while at the same time adapting  to
change occasioned by events and significant developments elsewhere.

The joint standing committee also played  a  critical  role  in  helping  to
assess the need for the intelligence community to grow, including  providing
support in this transformation.

Finally, bearing in mind that we are the guarantors of  your  ordinary  day,
we wish to turn the Chinese proverb on its  head:  May  you  never  live  in
interesting times and,  for  as  long  as  we  are  here  guaranteeing  your
security,  may  you  have  many  more  ordinary  days  and  may   the   only
extraordinary experiences be of a personal nature. I thank you. [Applause.]

paragraphs follows.)

[Dr  S  C  CWELE:  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  members,  executives  of   the
Department of Intelligence, members of Parliament who could  not  manage  to
be with us yet who have made a great contribution  to  this  committee,  and
who are in the NCOP, some of whom I can see in  the  public  gallery,  thank
you for this opportunity.

I dedicate my speech to the heroes of the struggle  for  the  liberation  of
South Africa, such as Comrade Joe Nhlanhla sitting over  there.  [Applause.]
I dedicate it to the members of the  secret  service  and  intelligence  who
work tirelessly to build a foundation for our freedom, so that  there  is  a
better life for all of us.

Today the tables  have  turned.  It  is  crystal  clear  that  this  ANC-led
democratic Government brings hope and a better life to  all  the  people  of
South Africa. To the Department  of  Intelligence  as  well,  the  winds  of
change have come. Although  we  are  a  small  and  economically  developing
country, no country can boast that it is better than South  Africa  when  it
comes to intelligence.]

In short, despite our shoestring budget, we have  successfully  developed  a
world-class  intelligence  community.  We  have  developed  a   professional
service that operates under secrecy, but still  upholds  our  democracy  and
the basic values of our  human  rights.  The  success  of  our  intelligence
services is grounded on professionalism, efficiency, effectiveness and  more
importantly, simplicity. I believe the  co-ordination  of  our  intelligence
services is the best in the world. Even the super-powers and  the  developed
economies continue to learn and draw from our experiences.

We must salute our intelligence services  that  adhere  to  the  simple  and
effective principle of co-ordination. As a result we  have  not  experienced
any major intelligence failure, as witnessed on September 11  and  elsewhere
in the world.

We are the best in organising successful  world  events.  We  can  name  the
conference of Num, the World Aids Conference, the World  Racism  Conference,
the AU launch, the WSSD last year and other world sport  events  which  have
all been  held  successfully  in  South  Africa.  Nia,  in  particular,  has
demonstrated that it is among the world's best in providing IT  security  as
demonstrated by creating impenetrable  walls  during  the  World  Summit  on
Sustainable Development. Regarding our external weighing, Sass  remains  the
leading force in conflict resolution in Africa and elsewhere on the globe.

Defence intelligence  provides  the  cutting  edge  intelligence  for  peace
operations in Africa as a whole. Crime intelligence  continues  to  lead  in
busting international drug syndicates and human smugglers. Our  intelligence
academy is playing a leading role in training our cadets  and  other  people
from the African continent. Despite  all  these  successes,  we  still  face
several challenges.

We are witnessing a changing global challenge that threatens global
security and the multilateral world order. Today there are more
sophisticated international crime syndicates involved in activities such as
money laundering and human and drug smuggling.
New forms of terrorism and other forms of extremism are transcending
multiple national borders. We see increasing unilateral actions coupled
with hostile foreign policies by those who claim to be the super-powers of
this world. We are witnessing new practices, such as cheque-book politics,
by nations acting in terms of the UN mandate and framework.

To illustrate these challenges, let us look at the war in Iraq. Where are
the weapons of mass destruction that the coalition forces were making
claims about? Did the American and the British intelligence services lie
about the weapons of mass destruction, or was their intelligence
manipulated by the politicians? What was the role of business in this
conflict, particularly that of American and British multinational
companies? Lastly, but most importantly, what was the role of the
intelligence oversight structures in those countries, and what are they
going to do now? We can only hope that they will investigate these
challenges and expose the truth.

It is against this background that our intelligence services are conducting
their duties. In addition, the new world order has dictated to us that we
should move away from the narrow focus of state security to a broader human
security involving socioeconomic and environmental issues. Our intelligence
has made significant strides in this regard. But clearly, more resources
are needed to match these new mandates.

As I have said, the co-ordination of intelligence has improved
significantly over the last financial year. This has been witnessed by the
quality of their products and the timelessness of producing those products.

I now come to one of the most important issues that the committee is
concerned about - the debate about national security. When we crafted our
White Paper, we were under the impression that we as South Africans were on
the same wave length when dealing with matters of national security. We
assumed that there were national security issues which were not only a
threat to individual liberties, but to our collective constitutional
democracy. We further assumed that people from all sectors of our society
would unite to fight these national security threats and defend our
democracy.

However, the recent events and divergent views on what we regard as
national security has led us to make a call for a national debate on what
we regard as our national security concerns. We hope that this House will
afford us this debate, and that the media, the academics and ordinary
people will actively participate in it.

The question has been asked about the role of this Joint Standing Committee
on Intelligence in ensuring that our intelligence services are operating
within the confines of our Constitution and our democratic order. We are
glad to report that the culture of respect for law, the Constitution and
the basic human rights of all our citizens prevails within our intelligence
services.

In line with the above, questions have been asked about why members of the
executive, for example, decline replying to some of the questions, and
refer them to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. The members of
this House will remember that a few years ago the President asked this
House to devise a mechanism for dealing with questions which may have a
bearing on national security.

The practice thus far has been that all those questions are referred to the
Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence where they are thoroughly
interrogated until the committee is satisfied with the answers. Thereafter
the chairperson of the committee briefs the members concerned without
divulging details which may have a negative impact on our national
security. A good example is a question which was raised by the hon Colin
Eglin on my left.

I would like to reiterate that our committee is a multiparty committee, but
we always endeavour to reach consensus. To date we have never voted on
issues in front of the committee for deliberations.

Our committee has interacted with other administrative structures that have
oversight over intelligence services. The office of the judge responsible
for interceptions and monitoring, under the guidance of Judge Gordon,
continues to ensure that the rights of our citizens are not unduly limited
by our security services. We thank the guidance that is given by this
office to our services, and we also appreciate the co-operation with the
committee.

The office of the Auditor-General has interacted with the committee on
several occassions during the last financial year. They have raised several
issues, among which are the role or nonestablishment of the evaluation
committee, the proper maintenance of the assets registered by the
intelligence services, the taxation of foreign allowances and sources for
intelligence services and the need to formalise the Presidential
Intelligence Budget Appraisal Committee, Pibac. The committee is grappling
with these issues, and they will appear in detail in our annual report to
Parliament.
The office of the Inspector-General is functional. We thank the Minister
for appointing the critical staff in this office. The committee, last
month, readvertised the post of Inspector-General after a poor response
late last year. We are happy to announce that by the closing date, last
Friday, we had an additional 42 new applicants for this important post. We
thank members of political parties for raising public awareness, and we
also thank the members of the media for assisting us in this regard.

This is one of the institutions that we created to ensure the functional
accountability of all our intelligence services. It is accountable to the
responsible Ministers, to Parliament through JSCI, and ultimately to the
President. This post requires a South African of high integrity with a
broad understanding of the oversight responsibility of intelligence
services. The committee will be holding public interviews during the next
few weeks in order to present a recommended candidate for approval by this
House.

Lastly, I would like to touch on two issues that the committee will be
seized by during the next few months. The first one is that of border
security. I would like to announce that the committee is concerned about
some aspects of our border security, and we will be conducting interviews
in this regard and will come back with recommendations to Parliament.

The other matter of concern for the committee is the extent of the
implementation of the Minimum Information Security Standard, the Miss
policy document, by state departments. The committee is worried about theft
of critical information, particularly computers, from some of our
parastatals and state departments. The committee will be embarking on
public hearings on this matter to assess the extent of the implementation
of this policy document.

In conclusion, I would like to stress that the tide has turned in South
Africa within the intelligence services. While others, elsewhere in the
world, may be asking: ``Where is Bin Laden?'' or ``Where is Saddam
Hussein?'' here in South Africa we can safely say that those involved in
Pagad activities, and those involved in the Boeremag activities, are facing
the music in our courts or in our jails. [Applause.]

We would also like to issue a word of warning to those South Africans or
other citizens who are involved in corrupt activities such as smuggling and
gangsterism, namely, that Big Brother is watching. We will catch them. We
support the budget vote. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Hon Deputy Chairman, hon Minister, hon members,
chairperson of our committee and colleagues on the committee, in the speech
which I made in this House last year, we were in the aftermath of the
attack on the two towers of the World Trade Centre in New York and on the
Pentagon in Washington DC. During October of that year, we also had 10
terrorist attacks in the Gauteng Province.

We have had disturbing events taking place in the northern hemisphere this
last month. There the people were letting down their guard on the terrorist
threat, because they were telling themselves that things have cooled down
now that the war in Iraq was over. In May of this year President Bush
boasted to the world that Al Qaeda was on the run, and with that Al Qaeda
struck. There were attacks in Riyad, in Chechnya and in Cassablanca. There
were fears that the attacks were heading south. The UK cancelled flights to
Kenya. New travel advisories to East Africa were issued.

Although these events were far away, we cannot ignore them. Today we are in
the aftermath of these terrorist attacks and the war. The main driving
force behind this Iraqi war was the supposed threat of weapons of mass
destruction. One must assume that both President Bush and Prime Minister
Blair had based their motivations and plans for the war on what their
relative intelligence agencies had advised them. Slowly, but surely, it is
transpiring that their intelligence services did not provide sufficient
evidence of weapons of mass destruction to warrant this war.

Chairperson of the JSCI, you also touched on this subject. Intelligence can
help win wars, but intelligence is more often an incomplete puzzle. Honest
spies appreciate their own limitations, but their political masters often
prefer certainty and no ambiguity. Any intelligence service needs integrity
and objectivity - Minister, you did mention that - to speak the truth to
power. They must be independent agencies which do not blow with the
political wind.

Analysts are now speculating that the intelligence provided to the leaders
has, as it is said, ``been sexed up'', as quoted in Time Magazine, and
manipulated to convey the wrong impression to warrant this war. The basic
lesson for our intelligence services is that they must have quality staff
who are honest and objective, and not influenced by politicians or party
aspirations.

We are in the process of appointing an Inspector-General of Intelligence,
which is to be ratified by this Assembly. In the light of what I have just
said, it also implies that our IG must be a person of quality, must be
honest, objective, and not a political pawn. Let us apply our integrity and
the courage of our convictions when selecting our IG. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE: Deputy Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members, the
civilian intelligence services have been undergoing a thorough renovation
in the past few years to streamline the services, to make them more
efficient, and to effect a full transformation from instruments of
repression and control and manipulation, to tools for building our country,
our region and indeed our continent.

I say renovation, because there needs to be some breaking down of what
there was, and some building up of new parts of the services, but
ultimately what we seek to achieve - like a newly renovated house - are
services which have increased in value.

There is no more appropriate time for the services to be doing such a
renovation. The world is experiencing a series of shudders and pressures
from global events, and none of us is immune to them. The integrity of the
reports that our services produce is of utmost importance. The accuracy of
information, its reliability and quality are paramount to this integrity,
and to achieving our peace, security and development objectives.

Hon members will be well aware of the problems that face the oversight
committees in the legislatures in the Unites States and in Britain with
regard to the accuracy and integrity of their intelligence reports leading
up to the invasion of Iraq. The value of the product of our services is
crucial. The JSCI, as the oversight committee of this Parliament, will need
to continue being vigilant in this regard.

While issues of the integrity of the intelligence product are common to all
the services, I would like to address here today the work of the SA Secret
Service, Sass, our external service, and the particular challenges that
they face. Sass has made considerable progress in the last year in several
areas, and part of the work of the oversight committee is to monitor such
progress.

To name a few, Sass has agreed recently to focus on aligning its work, both
in its structure and its functions, with the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Both departments work abroad and it is necessary for them to work closely
together to avoid duplication. To this end SASS and the DFA have entered
into a Memorandum of Understanding to prevent such duplication, and to work
more closely with one another. The committee supports these moves, and
regards this initiative as contributing to the better co-ordination of
Government generally, and to the maximising of resources to support the
interests of the country.

Secondly, Sass has embarked on a programme to review and upgrade its IT
systems. The security of the communications environment is crucial to the
services. A disaster recovery plan, which is long overdue, is being
implemented and programmes are in place to improve the levels of computer
skills amongst the members.

The JSCI has also been monitoring the Auditor-General's reports on internal
controls which have been improved in respect of assets. Lastly, efforts in
the services to improve career-pathing and succession planning are
welcomed.

Financial constraints are always a consideration, particularly in respect
of Sass, which operate internationally. Their budget is directly affected
by the fortunes of our currency. While watching the rand dip and dive -
although I must add in recent months climb - Sass must try and plan and
budget for its work, and on top of that, extend its representation abroad.
So we as a committee are very mindful of the challenges that this poses for
the services.

One of the outstanding issues that the committee is dealing with is the
question of tax on allowances for members serving abroad. It is intended
that the committee will engage with the Treasury on this matter to ensure a
mutually agreeable solution to the problem.

Sass, like all government departments, takes its direction from national
priorities. Through its central role in the formation of the African Union
and the Nepad programme, South Africa has signalled its intention to work
towards the building of a better Africa.

In this regard Sass has a vital support role to play in the country's
international endeavours, especially in our continental work. The effort of
our secret service underpins the South African, and indeed the African
Union, effort to achieve peace, stability and development on the continent.

It is pleasing that this focus on Africa has resulted in the addition of
several new stations in Africa, based on identified national priorities.
However, work must still be done to further increase the Sass
representation abroad to ensure a presence in each of the stations
identified as key for South African interests.

Sass has embarked on interactions with other services in Africa to exchange
information and so forth. And in building our relationships with other
African countries, members of the JSCI have also been involved in working
with our counterparts on the continent to share information, and to learn
about the work of other parliaments with respect to oversight and
accountability of intelligence services. Although there is no other
committee on the continent that is as established as the JSCI is to oversee
the work of the services, there are other parliamentary committees dealing
with security issues. Our committee members have interacted with MPs from
Ghana, Nigeria and Egypt, and in this regard we are also planning some
interactions with Malawian members of parliament.

The building of a better Africa is a key challenge for South Africa, and
will once again involve the gathering and processing of accurate and
timeous information. The efforts of Sass are central to our wellbeing as a
nation, but also to the development of a new Africa.

Sass's work supports the country's efforts in priority areas in the SADC
region, the Great lakes region, and works with multilateral institutions,
such as the African Union, SADC formations and the United Nations.

As the chair has already mentioned, it is in no small measure due to the
efforts of our services that, for example, the United Nations was able to
hold the biggest ever global conference in Johannesburg last year, the
World Summit on Sustainable Development. We need to salute the efforts of
our services in the behind-the-scenes work that took place in order for
such a huge and important conference to go off without incident. The same
can be said for the launch of the African Union in July last year, and
indeed for the World Cup Cricket. Through these efforts South Africa has
gained a reputation for being well-organised and for being a desirable
destination for world events. We can be justifiably proud of that.
As I have said, key to the continued development of our SA intelligence
services is the improvement of the accuracy, integrity and timeous
presentation of information gathered and prepared in reports.

The JSCI will continue to monitor compliance of the services with their
respective mandates, as well as progress made towards the realisation of
the goals of all the services. At the same time, we will support them in
the achievement of our mutual objectives, which are to ensure the security
of Government and its institutions, and every citizen of this country.

We support the budget vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Deputy Chairperson, it's quite an arresting experience,
standing up here to talk about something which I know absolutely nothing
about. [Laughter.] The situation is that I am not a member of the
intelligence committee. The IFP's member just so happens to be a member of
the NCOP, so he cannot participate this afternoon.

I did try to do some homework, however, and I went to ask him to tell me
what it was about, but he told me he wasn't allowed to tell me, because he
is sworn to secrecy. [Laughter.] I didn't give up there.

I started looking at what I had in my office and chatting to colleagues. I
went through the estimates of expenditure for the coming year. There was no
mention of the Ministry in there. I looked for the Ministry's strategic
study, and it doesn't appear, Minister, that you put out a strategy
document on what you intend to do over the next year. I looked back to last
year to try and find the annual report, there wasn't one either.
[Laughter.] But, eventually when I looked at the Treasury's strategic plan,
I found a couple of figures there. And what I did learn was that the
intelligence budget has been increased from something like R1,2 billion to
R1,76 billion in the current year. So, it rises some 30%, and that seemed
significant.

So, what I learnt is that a lot of money gets spent on intelligence and
that they are intending to spend more. But what do we spend it on? That
took me to the corridors where I spoke to members of a number of parties,
unfortunately none from the intelligence committee. I learnt things about
the need to stop bad guys from coming in from other countries - I think
they called it counterintelligence; that globalisation was inviting all
sorts of people to come and spy on us; and about the usual array of
internal threats. I heard about a couple of them in an earlier speech,
people like the Boeremag and Pagad. I just heard on the radio, half an hour
ago, about another new grouping - some white extremists - who think they
are God-sent to take over the country. So, just be careful there, Minister.
[Laughter.]

From all that chit chat, I still don't know what the Ministry does. The
other half of the question concerns the money we are going to give the
Ministry, and how well they spend it on whatever they spend it on. There
again, whether they spend it economically, efficiently and effectively, I
don't know that either. So, in other words, whether we get value for the
money, I'm not sure of that.

So, all in all, it might seem that I don't know anything. But I would
hasten to say there are a couple of things that I do know. The first is
that the Minister and her department are very secretive when you try to
find out things about them. The only other thing I can share with you is
that the IFP supports the Vote. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms M C LOBE: Deputy Chairperson, comrades and friends, when we commemorated
the 27th anniversary of the Soweto uprising, now called Youth Day, we were
reminded of our very painful past and further encouraged that never again
shall a security system of this country be used to undermine human rights.
This finds expression in Section 198 of the Constitution which, among other
things, states:


  National security must reflect the resolve of South Africans, as
  individuals and as a nation, to live as equals, to live in peace and
  harmony, to be free from fear and want and to seek a better life.

Our endeavour to seek a better life is also informed by the need to strive
for a better world order; to expand further the frontiers of freedom,
democracy, peace and unity; and to push back poverty, racism, oppression
and exploitation.

The creation of a better world and a better Africa, therefore, requires
liaison and co-ordination between our intelligence services and those on
our continent and further afield. In my view, this is value for money.

The need to intensify co-operation in this regard cannot be overemphasised,
particularly taking into account the 11 September incident in the United
States and other acts of terrorism in other countries, including the
Boeremag incidents in our own country.

It must be noted that terrorism is no longer against a particular country,
but a new trend is emerging wherein extreme right-wing forces, and, on the
other hand, some religious fundamentalists, are pursuing agendas that in
the main undermine the vision of a new world order.

The need for our services to share information with their counterparts
elsewhere, and the need to collect both strategic and technical
intelligence is mandatory on our services and, therefore, requires even
more resources.

This co-ordination and co-operation has yielded very positive results in
busting some transnational crimes. For example, we have learnt, in the
recent past, that vehicles were being hijacked and transported across our
borders and that syndicates were selling them in foreign markets. Our
services are breaking the backs of these international syndicates, and a
lot of work has been done to effectively and accurately deal with this
challenge.

Considerable strides have been achieved to curtail and bring to book the
human smuggling syndicates. You will remember the recent story in the media
regarding the illegal female immigrants, especially from the East, being
used to work illegally in some brothels around the country. Our point of
departure is that crime is a scourge that does not respect borders, with
syndicates that have made the entire globe a theatre of their operations.
Co-operation in this regard is, therefore, informed by the desire to
complement one another, and not competition. Like my mom always says: no
one of us is more beautiful than the rest of us.''

The launch of the African Union and the adoption of Nepad have taken our
vision of the African Renaissance to a new qualitative level. There is no
doubt that this brings with it enormous challenges for our country and the
continent, particularly noting the problems of violence and wars,
dictatorship and despotic regimes, the need for sustainable development and
economic growth, and the need for democracy and a culture of human rights.

Fully conscious of all the problems that still smite our continent, we
firmly believe that these are African problems that shall be solved by
Africans themselves. In view of this fact, our intelligence services will
have to be empowered to meet these challenges, which include the effective
utilisation of our database and other possibilities offered by the new
technology, effective employment of our intelligence capacity and a
reorientation towards changing Africa for the better; and in this regard
working with the people as partners in a common battle.

This is a paradigm shift from the previous role of the apartheid security
services that were used to undermine unity and to destabilise African
states.

My colleagues have already mentioned that in the recent past South Africa
hosted a number of international events, including the International
Cricket Cup, the World Summit on Sustainable Development and the launch of
the African Union. May I use this opportunity to thank our intelligence
services for ensuring that these events occurred in a safe, secure and
peaceful environment, and also for providing a world class service, that is
today commended by different countries in the world.

In 2006 South Africa will be hosting the fifth International Intelligence
Review Agencies Conference. The main objective of this conference is to
enable countries to share information regarding intelligence oversight,
because it is a relatively new phenomenon. As we have already said, the
previous conference was attended by only South Africa from our continent,
because we remain the only African country with a parliamentary
intelligence oversight committee, a challenge that the Joint Standing
Committee on Intelligence is grabbing with both hands.

As a result thereof, the JSCI, with the assistance of our services, has
been engaged in a programme of popularising the need for intelligence
oversight on the continent, within the framework of changing Africa for the
better. Most of the countries met by the JSCI have shown a keen interest in
improving their intelligence oversight mechanisms. The fourth International
Intelligence Review Agencies Conference will be held next year in the
United States, and hopefully some African countries will participate.

In conclusion, we hold firmly to the conviction that the obligation to
improve the quality of life of all citizens in order for them to use their
talents to help our society flourish within a safe, secure and stable
environment, is no doubt part of our core intelligence business.

This vision - the creation of a nonsexist, nonracial, democratic and united
South Africa - inspired young people in 1976 to understand that freedom and
justice is worth more than life itself. It is this very vision that today
continues to inspire our men and women in the intelligence services to work
even harder to ensure that you and I can enjoy the fruits of the liberation
that the 1976 generation fought so hard for. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Deputy Chairman, these mugs that the Minister is going to
give to all of us prove how good our spooks are. But I want to warn members
not to drink their coffee while in conversation, because it listens and can
hear what you are saying. [Laughter.]

The increase in the budgets of the National Intelligence Agency and the SA
Secret Services, is welcomed by the New NP. This will enable Sass to have a
presence at more foreign missions, which is an area that desperately needs
the services that Sass provides. It is almost unthinkable how the foreign
missions can operate fully and efficiently without such a presence in their
respective countries.

The SA Secret Services are doing very efficient and effective work for
South Africa, and we, from the New NP side, wish to congratulate the
Director-General and his staff for the professional job they are doing. One
area in the NIA, the National Intelligence Agency, which needs a great deal
more funding is the vetting department. There are far too few people
working in that area, and the pressures for security clearances are ever
increasing with inter alia, special events that are taking place in South
Africa more often. Once the Cape Town International Convention Centre has
become officially operational, a much larger burden will rest on the
vetting officials.

The many changes in senior intelligence services posts are also
contributing factors. These jobs usually have deadlines, which make it all
the more difficult. There is also a need for on-going security clearances
for present staff, which are often neglected because of the shortage of
qualified people to do the vetting. The latest development in the
Scorpions' human resources department is a case in point. The intelligence
academy is in its first year, and it seems to be a great success. We wish
them well and look forward to their first annual report.

The National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee, Nicoc, has produced well-
informed reports on current and future tendencies - both domestically and
internationally. This is an area which has really produced better work and
a smoother operation than in the past. Well done to the co-ordinator and
his team. We were impressed with the quiet dedication of the staff of the
NECC, especially the so-called back-room people who are doing a splendid
job, and who are all world experts in their fields. They really constitute
the essence of trust. There will always be a shortage of finances in an
ever-growing area like intelligence. One only has to keep track of the cost
of technology to appreciate this fact.

Therefore, the intelligence services cannot afford too much flexibility in
spending money on luxuries and grandiose ideas and plans. Money is needed
for operational expenses in the first place, and thereafter the nice-to-
haves can be considered.

As the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence, that oversight function is
our duty, and we must not be influenced otherwise. The cheapest type of war
is good intelligence. One can only deliver that with the necessary tools
and a great deal of dedication. We thank the intelligence community whose
members are, with a few exceptions, doing their work with diligence and
dedication.

We thank the hon Minister, Dr Lindi Sisulu, and her ministerial staff for
their support to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. In this
respect, a special thanks goes to Mr Dennis Nkosi, head of the Ministry for
his unfailing assistance and professionalism towards us as a committee.

We want to thank our chairperson for all the work he has done and for
taking over from the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs. We work well. South
Africa is in good hands. [Applause.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, Minister Sisulu, former Minister Joe Nhlanhla,
members, senior management and members of the intelligence services -
Comrade Joe, you must know that this committee salutes you. We will never
forget what you have done for this country. [Applause.]

Today marks a crowning moment in the history of the South African
intelligence community. Never before have members of the intelligence
community achieved such a milestone in the writing of the national
intelligence estimate. All are unanimous that the approval of the 2002 NIA
marks the zenith of the attempts at providing the intelligence clients with
such a satisfactory product.

All near SASS, defence and crime are clear that they have hit gold in this
process. The previous chapter of minority reports and reservations are
closed, never to return again. The challenge that Government faces is to
ensure that crime intelligence, the face of the fist that we use in the
fight against crime, does what it has to do in circumstances that are
financially enabling, politically conducive and operationally supportive.

Crime intelligence is the first part, even before crime is committed. It is
the key to the riddle of crime scenes, once crime is committed. Crime
intelligence is the seeker and solver of the so-called perfect crimes. It
is the personification of our quest towards ensuring that crime does not
pay. Whilst this is the case, the resources at their disposal remain, in
comparison to the rest of the intelligence community, a pittance.

As a country, we need to find ways in which we can better provide them with
the capacity that will enable them to turn the turning tide even better.
More has to be done and more can be done. This year the President enacted
the National Strategic Intelligence Amendment Act. In this Act the
President empowered crime intelligence to co-ordinate the crime
intelligence collected by the various arms of the intelligence services.
This means that crime intelligence, and only crime intelligence, will be
best placed to put together all information that is crime related in order
to advise Nicoc on a threat assessment pertaining to crime.

This is an important step in the quest for a scientific basis on which we
can arrive at a threat assessment of the dangers that are posed by crime.
No longer will we just rely on information available from one or some of
the intelligence agencies to determine what the threats facing our country
are.

In keeping up with the challenges at hand, I note and appreciate that crime
intelligence has had a number of notable achievemnts. These include,
amongst other things, the following: closure of several criminal syndicates
that deal in drugs; recovery and arrest of members of vehicle syndicates;
uncovering corruption and rightwing extremists that are bent on undermining
our constitutional democracy.

Crime intelligence does this to enable the SAPS to prevent, combat and
investigate crime, maintain public order, protect and secure the
inhabitants of this country and their property, and uphold and enforce law.

The tide has turned, and we are using better and more effective security
services in the crime fields. We are experiencing a better and more
efficient and effective crime intelligence service. However, we should not
be complacent. Complacency breeds inefficiency and leads to the faltering
of organisations - private and public.

Crime intelligence has been able to overcome many of the negative reports
registered against them by the Auditor-General. We noted that they have
taken steps to better manage their assets, as is the case with the other
arms of the intelligence community. In this regard they have corrected
errors pertaining to the control of vehicles and incorrect allocation of
budgets. We note that a fully fledged internal audit function has been
established. The original shortage of staff has also been addressed.

What we need in South Africa is consensus on fighting crime. We need to put
crime aside, outside the realm of narrow and sectarian politics. We have to
avoid making crime an election programme. Some members have already started
saying that we need 150 000 policepersons on the road. This call is
influenced by a short-sighted approach which does not understand that
police undercover work can only succeed if policepersons are enabled to
operate like fish in the water. This will mean that they will be able to
get the co-operation and support of the community to fulfil their mandate.
One more home that is ready to open its doors to enable the police to
survey criminals is one safer home, and one syndicate taken out of
business. We all have to support this trend in a nonsectarian way.

As long as we fight elections on the back of the police and crime, we are
just cutting our noses to spite our own faces. Let us close that chapter
and move on, knowing that with our contribution, support and commitment, we
are bringing a safer, more secure and prosperous South Africa into being.
We will do the opposite at our own peril.

Let me raise a matter of concern that affects crime intelligence and the
other arms of the intelligence community, namely, the taxation of sources.
It is our considered view, as the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence,
that these revenue raising measures need serious reconsideration. It cannot
be that we allow people to play the lotto and take their winnings without
tax deductions, and fail to be empathetic towards people whose payments
advance national security.

This taxation is not in the national interest. I, therefore, call upon the
Minister of Finance and the Commissioner of Sars to rethink and to
seriously review this. Members, I believe it is not too late to reverse
this decision. It might lead to the exposure of intelligence sources. It
makes those that are supposed to co-operate with our intelligence services
fear for their lives as a result of the possible exposure. This fear among
sources is not in the national interest. It will affect our intelligence
gathering capacity and the expansion our network. I thank you. [Time
expired.]

Mr S ABRAM: Chairperson, hon Minister, heads of our services and
colleagues, the National Intelligence Agency has come a long way since its
inception since 1995. The journey through amalgamation, broadening its
understanding of national security and finally reunderstanding its mandate
in line with crime expectations and requirements, has not been easy.
Through the length and breadth of these challenges, the resilience of the
women and men of the establishment has been remarkable.

Amidst the uncertainties that come with change, they have stood committed
to the ideal that the intelligence community is striving for. With its
successes and challenges, the previous year has seen a similar commitment
to succeed from NIA's personnel. A case in point was a cancellation of
leave for all members during the height of the hunt for, and the subsequent
neutralisation of, the rightwing extremist threat during the period of
October 2001 to January 2002.

Since 1995 the National Intelligence Agency's work has been around
terrorism, sabotage, subversion, espionage and organised crime, amongst
other things. Such focus made sense at the time, as the country was in the
process of protecting and consolidating the young and fragile democracy.
However, it must be remembered that around 1995 and beyond, there were
still pockets of violent tendencies in the country. We are aware that in
KwaZulu-Natal there had been a chronic case of tensions leading to
bloodbaths. To some extent Gauteng had imported some of the characteristics
of the KZN profile, particularly on the East Rand, Katlehong and those
places. While neutralising the threat of violence in KZN, this period also
marks the uncovering of third force activities. Trends of right-wing
extremism were not a far cry from some of these uncoverings.

Against the above background then, intelligence collection and reporting
tended to align with the threat that presented itself. Hence the National
Intelligence Agency's collection and reporting slant seemed more
politically inclined. The dictates of the day called for such inclination,
as the client had to be advised holistically and accurately. It was clear
that the above epoch would not last forever. Intelligence itself needed to
continuously interrogate its relevance in terms of the sociopolitical and
socioeconomic times, hence, the reunderstanding of NIA's mandate ensued.

When we talk of the reunderstanding of the NIA mandate, we are not
necessarily alluding to the previous misunderstanding of what the agency
should have worked on. Rather, reunderstanding alludes to the refocusing of
intelligence collection and reporting arms in line with the needs and
expectations of the clients as they present themselves.

In 2000, the National Intelligence Agency underwent a process of reflection
on the kind of work it had covered since its inception. How had the needs
of the client changed, if at all, and what was the discrepancy between the
two? This reflection demonstrated, indeed, that there was a discrepancy.
This then led the agency to align itself with the needs of the expectations
of the client. Six areas of intelligence interest then formed the basis for
intelligence collection. These were counterintelligence, political
intelligence, economic intelligence, border intelligence, organised crime
and corruption, as well as special events. Each of the intelligence focus
areas' themes and priorities allowed such breakdown, in order for the
agency to build a sufficiently microscopic picture so that the agency could
give a comprehensive picture to the client.

In the wake of the threat of national and international terrorism,
particularly in 2002, there came a need to add a seventh area of
intelligence interest to our list, namely terrorism. To date, the agency
collects on all seven areas of intelligence interest. The reunderstanding
of NIA's mandate also meant that the agency needed to restructure in order
to be appropriately positioned to deliver a comprehensive product. Coupled
with this restructuring process, the agency needed to move closer to the
client, in order to be sufficiently attuned to his or her needs. This need
led to the decentralisation of power from headquarters to each of the nine
provinces. This allowed for strategic and tactical decisions to be made on
the ground, and speedy response to be given to client requirements.

The reunderstanding, restructuring, and decentralisation processes have
posed several challenges in the work of intelligence. I wish to highlight
some of these. One of the most paralysing elements on the path of
intelligence work continues to be the lack of vigilance and appreciation of
security matters within Government. Government holds in its ambit sensitive
state information, along with a wide range of resources and assets. The
need for appropriate safeguarding is not matched with Government employees'
own sense of urgency around the need to protect. As long as we do not
appreciate the significance of vigilance in our time, we will be at the
mercy of those who do not have the best interest of South Africa's
development at heart.

Clandestine sabotage of Government initiatives is not impossible in this
context. In fact, the intelligence picture has demonstrated foreign
interest manifesting in a disguised manner within various institutions of
South African interest. This matter cannot be overemphasised.

The labour intensive nature of intelligence work means that the agency
cannot fully live up to its mandate while prioritising around fixed and
limited resources. For the information of the hon Dr Woods, the budget for
our National Intelligence Agencies, NIA and SASS is R1,2 billion. If you
compare this to the budget of the CIA, which runs into scores of billions
of dollars, and agencies in the UK, then, Sir, you can see how vulnerable
we are.

For example, if we say NIA must establish the security competence of every
Government employee, this means that millions of people need to be
subjected to rigorous NIA processes. This process cannot take place without
having adequately trained men and women in the agency. The proportion of
this to the client departments and their employees, is laughable. The value
of the human factor in intelligence can never be overemphasised. The
failure of intelligence in the now historic events of 11 September
indicates that, to a large extent, the human factor has been relegated to
second place with overemphasis on technology and other vehicles for the
intelligence trade craft.

As was the pattern during the last budget vote debate, the agency has had
to prioritise critical posts to be filled, and could not embark on the
ideal human resources generating process for the whole organisation. Such
prioritising processes mean that more often than not the agency finds
itself needing to spread scarce resources thinly across critical areas.
Many a time this compromises the quality of the product and, hence,
compromises service delivery to the client. In keeping with international
trends of attaining particular skills for particular functions, the agency
has found itself losing rare skills to more competitive offers. We have
also lost our Deputy DG who is now the new DG of Home Affairs.

Continuous training and upgrading the skills of intelligence officers are
also challenges, particularly in the context of demands on members posed by
this reunderstood mandate. The intelligence agency finds itself in a highly
sophisticated electronic environment. In order to keep up with the
developments in this area, the agency requires adequate funding to keep up
with the competitive environment in the intelligence world. It is even more
imperative to be able to counter some of the espionage actions used against
the agency.

I would like to say a word on the Inspector-General who is to be appointed
very soon. The office of the IG, which will also have to act as a
representative of both civil society and the services, will help to
strengthen the understanding amongst our people of the objects of
intelligence in this country. People from the broad citizenry will
naturally be free to approach the office of the Inspector-General.

Before I conclude - not that I want to conclude, I still have a couple of
pages, but unfortunately this thing is ticking away - may I congratulate
the chairperson of the JSCI, as well as the previous chairperson, who has
created a culture of an open-door policy which is running like a golden
thread through the JSCI. I want to advise my friends on this side - the hon
Schalkwyk is aware of all the processes that he has gone through where he
brought sensitive matters to the attention of the JSCI - that it will be
good for all of us and bode well for the national security of our country
if we stop parading in front of certain properties and pose in front of the
media and have photographs taken. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, hon Ministers and members, I rise in support of
the National Treasury Vote. I also wish to take this opportunity to commend
the good work done by all our intelligence services and the Ministry of
Intelligence. I wish to use the few minutes at my disposal to highlight the
critical importance of the gathering of financial intelligence and the role
of the Financial Intelligence Centre.

National security, safety and ethical accounting practices are key elements
of sound governance. Gathering of financial intelligence has become
critical to South Africa in order to sustain our growing economy. At the
heart of fiscal integrity is the availability of mechanisms to determine
irregular fiscal practices. The Financial Intelligence Centre is such a
mechanism to track down illegal financial transactions. The centre has its
own website and provides information that should assist the public in
making informed decisions about the level of crimes surrounding money
laundering. The data will also assist in tracking the international path of
illegal crime syndicates.

South Africa's money laundering industry is estimated at about R70 billion
a year. This is a huge sum of money that impacts on the security of the
state. However, for the state to become adequately secure, its own service
officials should be people of integrity, people who are above reproach. A
recent article has highlighted the corrupt practices of a few officers in
the Scorpion Investigations Unit. It is disconcerting when everything is
done to cut down on crime that high profile units, such as the Scorpions,
cannot be trusted to perform their work in the interest of society. Every
area of South African society seems to be under of some or other criminal
influence.

Efficient intelligence services are indeed necessary, but we need to ensure
that we can back up the services with effective controls. With the increase
of terrorism worldwide, financial intelligence becomes critical. However,
we need to distinguish between paranoia and real threat by ensuring that
our democracy is not undermined by international crime, terror syndicates
or global political interests.

The Financial Intelligence Centre, the FIC, must be properly resourced with
the proper personnel, with an understanding that a mandate is received from
the South African public to serve their national best interest. South
Africa should not be a tax haven for the money launderer, the professional
gambler or the terrorist. It should also protect its own sovereign interest
in the international market.

South Africa is unfortunately a soft target for criminals, therefore,
everything needs to be done to bring our crime levels under control. The
FIC has an important role to play, and we support its function and
financial allocations in this budget. I thank you.
Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, allow me to use this opportunity to pay
tribute to the hon Joe Nhlanhla, most importantly for his efforts in
helping to bring about the democratic order that we enjoy in South Africa,
and secondly, for the intelligence dispensation that we are debating today.
South Africa owes the hon Joe Nhlanhla a debt of deep gratitude.
[Applause.]

Defence intelligence, which is the field I am going to cover today, is the
primary intelligence organisation of the Ministry of Defence and the SA
National Defence Force. This organisation continues to produce high
quality, military related intelligence products in support of planning
processes and operations. Some examples of these are defence intelligence
deployments to the Great Lakes region in support of our Government's
initiative and SA National Defence Force operations. Other strategic
successes, enjoyed by this organisation in the past year, have been the
development of strategic partners through the means of intelligence
liaison.

In order to measure client satisfaction in terms of the quality of defence
intelligence products, the strategic step has been taken to produce
operational and strategic intelligence products in an integrated manner,
instead of separately. Other successes enjoyed by defence intelligence can
be found in its efforts at rendering special services to our law
enforcement agencies in support of their crime prevention strategy. We
commend this organisation for these and other achievements.

Our defence intelligence service also faces challenges, one of which is a
high level of natural attrition. Approximately 10% of defence
intelligence's workforce was lost to other state departments or the private
sector. This is a large number of employees to lose, and is due to the
perennial problem of remuneration not matching that of the competition.
This forces this organisation to have to recruit and train new members to
its required standards. Together with the need for new headquarters,
defence intelligence desperately needs new information systems that are
capable of supporting the organisation's mobile operations.
Although a plan for a new system has been drafted, its costs are such that
the organisation will have to wait five years for its development, given
the other priorities that exist within defence intelligence and the SA
National Defence Force. Consequently, innovative solutions will have to be
researched in order to bridge these priority gaps, and thereby fulfil the
needs of defence intelligence.

This organisation also faces key transformation challenges, and the need to
understand and practise good governance. This includes some serious
problems created by certain defence intelligence structures, which it is
hoped we will report on to Parliament in the very near future. Another
serious problem is the fact that defence intelligence's allocated budget
figure is hidden within the budget of the SA National Defence Force, and is
not clearly stated or shown. This is unacceptable to those of us who serve
on the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence. The JSCI has given notice
to defence intelligence's top management that as of the year 2004 we expect
this situation to be rectified.

In this regard the question before us is the following: Is the absence of a
budget figure for defence intelligence reasonable and justifiable in an
open, democratic society? We are of the firm belief that it is not. All
other intelligence services in this country provide this information to the
JSCI so that their budgets can be properly interrogated in keeping with the
provisions of the Intelligence Services Oversight Act and the Public
Finance Management Act, amongst others, in a manner that provides for
accountability and yet still protects our national security.

The identification and assessment of threats lie at the heart of the
intelligence profession. The primary task of intelligence is to warn the
state and society about real or potential threats, hostilities, dangers,
risks and crises, derived from whatever source or circumstance that may
affect national security interests. We are informed that in practice the
more precise nature of intelligence work should be viewed against the
framework of national values and the domestic maturity of any country.

As national security is linked with regional and international security, a
sound theory of national security should include the need for meaningful
internationl co-operation, the promotion of world peace, as well as the
security and wellbeing of mankind as a whole. Intelligence work should
serve all these objectives in the common interest of a safe state and
society.

This brings me to the vexing issue of the selective use of intelligence by
certain policy-makers or decision-makers, and their need for intelligence
to support already formed political and ideological conceptions. We are
taught, however, that the effect of intelligence on policy formulation
should never result from prescriptive or manipulative behaviour, but from
the timeliness and accuracy of information, as well as the quality of
intelligence estimates.

We then ask the question: On what basis was Iraq invaded and subsequently
occupied? Did George W Bush ignore his own intelligence on whether or not
Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction? The reason advanced for the
invasion of Iraq was that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass
destruction. These have not been found, and now one of George W Bush's most
avid supporters in this regard, Paul Wolfowitz, admits that the real reason
for the invasion was that Iraq is afloat with oil which the United States'
economy, and George Bush's cronies, desperately need.

Intelligence reports should be the rockbed upon which governments make
decisions in order to advance their policies and to promote the stability
and prosperity of not only their own citizens, but also that of others.
Intelligence reports, however, cannot be manipulated by the wishes and the
agenda of certain Washington think-tanks nor can intelligence reports be
fused with obscure Ph D theses, as was done by Prime Minister Tony Blair.
One of the consequences of this manipulation is that the value, credibility
and integrity of future intelligence reports from British and American
services will be profoundly diminished.

Given the fact that millions of people throughout the world believe that
there is a case for the prosecution of Bush, Blair, Rice, Rumsfeld, et al,
the United Nations Security Council's recent decision to exempt the USA
from the provisions of the international criminal court is unfortunate, to
say the least. We are also informed that the respective oversight
committees in Britain and America are conducting enquiries into this
matter, and we look forward to the results that emanate therefrom. It would
appear though, that in the minds of Blair, Bush, Condoleeza Rice and
Rumsfeld, the end has justified the means.

In South Africa we look forward to a greater future, and we depend and rely
upon our proud intelligence services to provide that future. I thank you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR INTELLIGENCE: Deputy Chairperson, happily mine is not a
very difficult job, because traditionally I have enjoyed the support of the
intelligence community who've taken the path less travelled in these
environments by ensuring that they supplement conflict with support, and
confrontation with encouragement. I want to thank them for their
contribution today.

I want to say to members here today that before we came to the Chamber, I
had to ask the Speaker for permission to use hot water to make the
particular demonstration that we had here. She told me: ``Listen, I would
need to check our records to see just how much heat there is in the Chamber
when you speak when you have the intelligence debate.'' She checked and she
came back and said it's the most civil debate we've ever had in the
Chamber. [Applause.] However, she asked me to please remove the hot water
before the Minister of Justice and hon Johnny De Lange came. [Laughter.] I
signed on the dotted line and I will remove the hot water.

The hon Woods is not here. I just wanted to tell him that should he ever be
in doubt about what happens in any structure of Government, he should
consult Hansard. It is the easiest thing to do. He will find the reports,
year in and year out, by any Minister and the debates of the committees.
Moreover, he will find that there is a report readily available, provided
by the joint standing committee, for the public.

I need to indicate to him that the additional money we have been given is
not for additional work, it is actually to cover the cost of the additional
structures as we grow. And finally to hon Landers, you can trust us. We
don't ``sex-up'' our documents; the only thing we ``sex-up'' is our
intelligence officers. Thank you. [Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 24 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Chairperson, hon
members, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, over the past two or
three weeks a few things that are of relevance to our justice system have
happened. One of them was a statement made by the hon Jacob Zuma, the
Deputy President of the Republic of South Africa, at Bonteheuwel. The other
was a sudden resurgence of vigilantism in various parts of our country. The
last one was a totally unexpected, unnecessary statement from eight judges
president attacking the Minister for remaining silent when judges' judicial
independence and values of the Constitution were allegedly under attack and
being undermined by so-called ill-informed politicians.

The common factor among all these is encapsulated in the following
questions, among others: Are we as a country better positioned now, more
than ever before, to enter the Nepad vision of an African century in which
the broad and efficient dispensation of justice will help us create a
humane society where peace, security and dignity will prevail over crime,
fraud, corruption and the flagrant abuse of human rights and lawlessness?
Bearing in mind that our justice system, and in particular our criminal
justice system, faces relatively new challenges such as major organised
crime, terrorism, drug trafficking and consumption, trafficking in human
beings, money laundering, high levels of violent crime and rampant
antisocial behaviour; are our laws, rules, procedures and sentencing
principles enabling us to respond appropriately to the new worldwide
problems and phenomena? Is the system sufficiently sensitive and responsive
to the communities it serves? Do the people themselves, by and large, have
confidence in it?

Within the time you have kindly allocated to me, I will attempt to deal
with these questions. I shall, however, assume that hon members are aware
of the numerous legislative and other interventions we've made to provide
answers to some of them. Our President has enjoined his Cabinet to
eliminate the silo effect of departmentalised governance by giving true
effect to the cluster system. In effect, this means that departments have
to co-operate more fully with one another, collaborate with civil society
and pool and utilise resources more efficiently and effectively.

Hon members have already participated in the budget debates of my cluster
colleagues. So it would probably be an opportune moment to highlight the
importance of the integrated approach we adopt to our cluster's work. The
primary purpose of our cluster is to integrate our sectoral services from
the police service at one end of the spectrum, through justice and social
development - in the middle so to speak - to correctional services at the
other end. In essence, this calls for the provision of a seamless client-
centred approach with each skilled sector linking its work to the work of
the other sectoral role-players.

The cluster Ministers meet weekly to get briefings on and debate crucial
issues so as to ensure that political and operational messages are
reinforced and carried through to our executive and middle level managers.

The criminal justice system operates as a collective of parts, and is
underpinned by the axiom that we are only as strong as our weakest link. We
need to identify the underbelly of the criminal justice system, take steps
to strengthen it, and ensure that each link functions smoothly to ensure
that South Africa becomes safer and more secure for all and attracts and
retains more direct foreign and domestic investment. If we fail to do so,
we shall not meet our growth targets, unemployment will rise, the youth, in
particular, will become marginalsed, despondent and alienated as a result
of the lack of opportunities and crime will in turn increase.

Over the past nine years the context for policy-makers has changed
dramatically. Our constitutional democracy has elicited a fairly litigious
response from the public as more and more people exercise their rights by
seeking legal remedies in our courts. Our legal system, therefore, must
respond to macroenvironmental and microenvironmental factors with a focus
on solutions engineering within an integrated framework. Moreover, changes
in one of the cluster departments could have a profound impact on the
workings of another. For example, efficiency gains in the police service
would imply an increase in the number of people entering the criminal
justice system. Both the courts and the prisons would feel the effect.

However, this should not lead to a tacit acceptance that case backlogs
would increase commensurately with an increase in the awaiting-trial
prisoner population. The solution is to provide a balance in the relative
efficiency of the participating departments through, for example, improved
training, the application of appropriate technologies and the development
of stronger linkages for improved communication between the various role-
players.

It is our aim, as a cluster, to build greater trust and credibility for the
entire criminal justice system to produce a response that affirms victims,
witnesses and communities, and that works in the interest of justice. We
will do this by, among other things, improving incrementally the quality of
our policing services, ensuring more effective prosecutions, striving for a
system where the punishment fits the crime, putting the victims and
witnesses at the heart of the process, and assuring improved care and
rehabilitation in and after prison.

As a cluster, we must vigorously implement initiatives which form the basis
for the criminal justice strengthening programme. A vital component of this
programme is the integrated case flow management system, a project launched
to deal proactively with the huge backlog of both civil and criminal cases
in our courts. This system will enable all role-players in the case
management process to work jointly with a view to co-ordinating planning
processes and utilisation of resources for greater impact and improved
service delivery. This iniative is being strengthened by other projects,
such as the integrated court centre project, the court management
information system project and the operation centre.

Last year, when we introduced new information systems initiatives, I
provided this House with a detailed report about the programme. To date,
IJS court centres have been established at 39 lower courts throughout the
country. The project has resulted in improved case preparation and reduced
case cycle times. Court statistics show that the average cycle time of
cases has declined from 110 to 74 days. The court management information
system incorporates aspects such as the number of cases finalised per
courtroom and per judicial officer, cases withdrawn, the proportion of
cases disposed of and the number of new cases per courtroom and per
judicial officer. Encouraged by the initial results, we have decided to
extend the Southern Gauteng pilot project to the rest of the courts in
Gauteng and all the courts that currently have IJS court centres. We intend
to progressively expand the system to cover courts in other regions.

We must also increase our efforts in respect of plea bargaining. The House
will know that the introduction and effective use of plea bargaining
mechanisms have contributed to a gradual improvement in the disposal of
cases in our courts. The full potential of this mechanism has not yet been
achieved, and as training in this field reaches more of our prosecutors and
courts, we remain confident that its impact on court rolls will become
increasingly significant.

Our bail legislation also makes provision for a review of bail for
offenders. The implementation of this provision needs to be intensified so
that the number of awaiting-trial prisoners, quite a significant number of
whom are in any event petty offenders, can be substantially reduced.

Other key solutions in this area should include alternative dispute
resolution mechanisms and a simplification of the criminal procedure. A
report, with some exciting recommendations, has already been completed by
the SA Law Reform Commission. Some of the recommendations are: out of court
settlements in criminal cases; improving the application of the Criminal
Procedure Amendment Act, which is intended to create a filtering mechanism
in respect of criminal appeals from the magistrates' courts to the High
Court and the establishment of customary courts on a sounder legal basis.
These courts are inexpensive, simple, informal, accessible, and are
conversant with the various communities and their laws, customs, pre-trial
services and pre-trial conferencing.

In addition, we must ensure that our intersectoral task teams are
functioning effectively. At all times departmental efficiency must be
viewed as a function of cluster efficiency.

The department is currently putting into place a new programme called, Re
Aga Boswa, which means: We are rebuilding. The programme calls for
extensive business process re-engineering and a revision of organisational
structures in our courts to improve efficiency and customer service. The
court services delivery model seeks to devolve the budget and decision-
making powers to the courts to empower them to their full potential. The
implementation of the new model will result in phasing out the regional
offices and the diversion of the capacity and resources currently residing
there to the courts where they are sorely needed. This initiative signals a
clear commitment to improving the management of our courts and instilling
in their administration a more professional ethic and practice.

We are also accelerating the appointment of court managers and redefining
the role of registrars of courts. During 2002, 18 new permanent judges were
appointed and further appointments are being processed. An amount of R20
million has been set aside to increase the number of magistrates and
prosecutors to cope with the escalating court rolls.

To deal with the case backlogs facing us, 3 027 Saturday and additional
courts sat during the period January to September 2002. This amounted to 10
153 additional court days. These Saturday and additional courts finalised
27 570 cases from January 2002 to March 2003. More courts are encouraged to
sit over weekends to reduce unacceptable case backlogs.

During 2002-03 we delivered new courts to our communities at an
unprecedented rate. An amount of R211 138 000 was spent on establishing new
courts at Botshabelo, Queenstown, Kroonstad, Khutsong, Khayelitsha, Blue
Downs, Patensie and Middledrift. Ongoing extensions at various other courts
ensured that our capital budget was put to the best possible use.

For many people in more privileged communities, the construction of a court
in the neighbourhood might be taken for granted, but as witnessed earlier
this year, the opening of our new court in Khayelitsha by our President saw
the introduction of court services to the 700 000 residents of Khayelitsha
who previously had to use other court service points at considerable
transport cost to the many individuals who had to cover vast distances to
reach them. [Applause.]

Building this court formed the cornerstone of the Khayelitsha community's
urban renewal plan and has had a catholic ripple throughout the community.
A recent Sunday Times report summed it up quite succinctly, and I quote:


  Consider what this means: Local police and prosecutors can conclude cases
  faster and for criminals the long arm of the law is nearby, sending a
  powerful message. For ordinary folk, having a court means that for the
  first time they have real access to the justice system. The building was
  built to attract, so the victims, when they see the court, see hope.
  Commercial and recreational developments are exploding with the court as
  their centre. These are all part of our President's Urban Renewal
  Strategy, which will undoubtedly provide a fresh face for the settlements
  apartheid created throughout South Africa.

For this new financial year, an amount of R229 million has been allocated
for capital works and R35 million for the upgrading of existing
infrastructure. The construction of new court buildings is underway at
Tembisa, Benoni, Boksburg, Scottburgh as well as Atteridgeville, Randburg,
Pretoria North, Atamelang, Sasolburg and Sebokeng. Over and above this, we
have set up three new courts and offices in the Johannesburg and Pretoria
CBDs for specialised commercial crime cases. The specialised commercial
crime courts, which have been a remarkable success since their inception,
registered more than a 95% conviction rate in 2002. This year has seen the
trend persist with a current average of more than five court hours per day.

We also continue to broaden access to justice for people through the legal
aid justice centres and the utilisation of public defenders in our courts.
Forty-six justice centres have been established to date, and an additional
23 are planned for the coming 18-month period.

Crime all over the world remains a problem which consumes huge amounts of
resources, and which increases with the advent of new technology. For
example, cyber crime is emerging as a major problem. Although we can re-
engineer the criminal justice system to deal with all kinds of crime, we
also need to address the root causes of crime. This entails having to
identify the factors which give rise to crime. This process was started by
the National Crime Prevention Strategy which stated that environmental
design contributes to criminality. In respect of technology, it would of
necessity mean that more creative ways of eliminating technology-based
crime are devised.

However, we also need to acknowledge that poverty is a major cause of
crime. This is partly borne out by the fact that many awaiting-trial
prisoners are persons who cannot even afford to pay small amounts of bail,
thereby causing overcrowding in our prisons. This is a major cause for
concern. Government is acutely aware of its responsibilities in this
regard.

Childcare grants are being progressively extended to cater for children
between the ages of seven and fourteen. Steps have been taken to stimulate
the economy. Housing programmes and land reform projects are being
accelerated. And business, labour and the Government are involved in
discussions on how to reduce unemployment, among other things.

It is apparent, therefore, that a holistic approach is needed to combat
crime and that effecting improvements to the criminal justice system
without eliminating the root causes of crime will not solve all our
problems. The department is presently engaged in a consultation process
with the judiciary and other key stakeholders regarding the rationalisation
of the High Courts in terms of the Superior Courts Bill. We intend to
ensure that High Courts are distributed in accordance with our political
and constitutional boundaries, and we want to de-establish High Courts
still constituted by the legislation of the erstwhile homelands. The
rationalisation of the Labour Court is at an advanced stage, with
legislation being prepared to integrate that court and the Labour Appeal
Court into the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal dispensation.

Security in our courts is an ongoing challenge for our department with R23
million having been allocated to this item for the year 2002. Thirty-two
thousand houses of judges in the Western Cape have now been secured. One
hundred and eighty four offices received cash-in-transit services from
private security companies at a cost of R8 million. A further R9 million
was spent on the insulation of security fencing and lighting. The current
budget allocation of R45 million for security services is still
insufficient to meet the minimal security standards in our courthouses, and
an increased annual amount is allocated over the three-year MTEF period.

The computerisation of the Guardians Fund has reached an advanced stage and
will revolutionise the administration of the trust funds for minors. It is
important to know that the Guardians Fund has grown by 18% this past year.
From December 2002 the Masters assumed responsibility for the
administration of the estates of black persons. This has led to the
establishment of service points at all magistrates' offices, putting
additional strain on the training budget. The transition, though, has not
caused as much disruption as we had anticipated. The situation is being
managed well by the service points.

Corruption in the Masters' offices is being weeded out via a vigorous
internal audit mechanism and a system of improved controls. Ongoing
training, specialisation in various services offered by the Masters and an
improved oversight mechanism augur well for the future of these offices.

The National Prosecuting Authority has come a long way since its inception
five years ago. This institution continues to set increasingly high
standards of performance for itself, and monitors and enforces performance
level agreements with singular determination. In order to facilitate
improved service delivery in the Eastern Cape, an interim management team
was established to assist the provincial government to alleviate backlogs
and eliminate blockages in service delivery.

In addition the NPA initiated a law enforcement intervention component, the
Joint Anticorruption Task Team, JACTT, which started operating in December
2002, and was established in terms of Act 74 of 1996. The National Director
of Public Prosecutions and the Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner of
Police officially launched the project at the end of January 2003. This
unit will continue to unclog the backlog of public service fraud and
corruption cases and expose those corrupt elements who hold positions of
trust, but abuse the trust that has been placed in them. The JACTT has, in
a short period of time, had an impact on the fight against crime in the
Eastern Cape. In March this year alone, about 110 people were arrested, 82
cases are currently on the roll and 171 cases are still being investigated.

It is also true that we will never win the war against crime unless we take
the profit out of crime. The use of asset forfeiture to fight crime has
been one of Government's important innovations. The AFU has now initiated
over 300 cases and frozen criminal assets worth nearly R500 million. There
is already over R25 million in the criminal assets recovery account, and
the law says we must spend this amount to fight crime. I will convene a
meeting of the Committee of Ministers within the next few months to decide
how best we can use this money. I see it as real justice when we take money
from criminals and use it to fight their crime.

During 2002, the department saw the finalisation of 14 Bills in Parliament
and introduced a further six pieces of legislation for consideration by the
portfolio committee.

Law reform efforts will continue for the foreseeable future and we
anticipate that a steady stream of legislation will be laid at Parliament's
door for consideration. Of particular note in this regard is the fact that,
with effect from today, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair
Discrimination Act of 2000 has come into effect. [Applause.] This Act will
no doubt be conducive to the construction of a society founded on the core
value of equality, to which all of us gathered in this House profess to be
committed.

My department has placed a premium on the delivery of visible, quality
services in a way that will make an impact on the lives of all South
Africans. However, we also have concentrated our energies on putting our
house in order. The department is evolving, albeit slowly, into one of the
most admired Government departments in South Africa and one of the justice
departments that is perceived to be best in the international arena. I wish
to thank the director-general and his team for putting in place the
architecture and machinery that will ensure optimal performance levels. We
need to harness everyone's energies within the department to ensure that we
are a successful organisation. We have entered into a people's contract for
a better life.

Recently, the Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional
Development, as part of its mandate to consider the budget of the
department, held hearings with all the relevant role-players, including the
judiciary. Certain remarks were attributed to the hon Adv Johnny de Lange
in the press, the chairperson of the portfolio committee, and provoked an
unusual response from most of the judges president. Whilst I have not been
provided with a copy of the statement released by judges president in
response to the comments allegedly made by hon De Lange, I have read the
newspaper reports.

In the first place, I need to categorically state that the Government
unequivocally supports and respects the independence of the judiciary. We
fully subscribe to the provisions of the Constitution in this regard. This
is demonstrated by the Government having abided by all decisions given
against it by our courts without taking any steps, legislative or
otherwise, to circumvent those judgments. We believe that this is the
hallmark of a true democracy.

In the second place, we are also fortunate in the sense that the judgments
delivered by our courts, particularly the Constitutional Court, the Supreme
Court of Appeal and our High Courts are of an exceptionally high standard.
Other jurisdictions, therefore, study these decisions. We have to maintain
this high degree of professionalism and independence of the judiciary if
our democracy is to thrive.

No plan or intention or inclination exists to undermine its independence
and no steps are contemplated to do so. An informed and constructive public
debate on the judiciary as an institution cannot, by any stretch of the
imagination, be said to be a threat to the institution and its
independence.

What may certainly do our policy irreparable harm is a kneejerk, overtly
rightwing, ideological reaction to the necessary debate. What we as a
people must surely not countenance are occasionally snide ideological and
political attacks launched on the executive by some judges cowering behind
judicial independence. [Applause.] To us, and certainly to all intelligent
and reasonable people, the much misused concept of judicial independence
means only the following: that the integrity of this arm of the state must
be guaranteed. By this we mean and expect that the judgments of the courts
must be respected; that the orders of the courts must be enforced; that
judges must be able to perform their judicial work without fear of adverse
consequences flowing from their judgments and orders; and that not even a
scintilla of a possibility of any reward for arriving at a particular
result should be expected.

In my capacity as Minister, I meet with the judges from time to time to
discuss matters of mutual concern. Some of the issues which are discussed
relate to salaries, conditions of service generally and the whole question
of the transformation of the judiciary. These discussions take place within
the context of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine which
exists in our country; our efforts to strengthen the role of the judiciary
in protecting the rule of law; making South Africa safer and more secure
for all; and creating a climate which facilitates, attracts and retains
investment.

Our courts, particularly at the level of the higher courts, have a crucial
role to play in bringing about change. Their judgments bind the lower
courts. Those judgments have to be carefully considered on the basis of
South African law; must develop the common law; reflect, where appropriate,
internationally recognised legal principles; and contribute to the
development of our jurisprudence. These courts need to be strengthened to
ensure that they function professionally and efficiently at all times.

I was astounded by a statement in the Sunday Times which suggested that the
DA believes that it is high time that the Minister, as hon De Lange's
political boss, ought to hold him on a leash. The statement, whatever its
authorship, reflects worrisome ignorance of the fact that the legislature
functions independently of the executive, which cannot prescribe to it.
[Interjections.] It functions in terms of our Constitution which empowers
the National Assembly, or any of its committees, to hold meetings and
investigate matters which affect our country. I also wish to state
categorically that I have not done or said anything that may be described
as a repudiation of the chairperson of the portfolio committee. [Applause.]
I have no authority and no mandate to do so.

With the few minutes still left I need to canvass the issue relating to the
statement by the Deputy President. I think that all reasonable people must
thank the Deputy President for highlighting the need for all of us to look
into the criminal justice system. The Deputy President, who - it is useful
to remember - was at the forefront of the fight for the section 35 rights,
which we now so easily take for granted, would never pose a threat to those
rights.

The Deputy President highlighted a very important debate which is not
confined to our country. It's a debate that is raging all over. It is
acknowledged in democracies that criminal justice systems, which were put
together with the best intentions of protecting the most vulnerable against
the awesome powers of the state, tend to lag behind in many respects.
Whether you like it or not, they tend to be less sensitive to the needs of
the communities that they serve, and to the needs of witnesses and victims
of crime. It is important, therefore, for us to look into our own laws,
such as the Criminal Procedure Act, and see if, indeed, we cannot identify
the sorts of weaknesses that we need to address.

The criminal justice systems of this world, not just South Africa's, are
also confronted with relatively new types of crime, such as cyber and
organised crime, drug trafficking and trafficking in fellow human beings.
We need to be able to respond to these and respond also to the relative
strength of the criminal element and the network that this criminal element
has spawned beyond our borders and, indeed, on a worldwide basis.

Once you understand the need for the work that has to be done, you will
readily agree with me when I say: ``Makabulelwe uMsholozi - let Msholozi be
thanked.'' Even the DA acknowledges this. It acknowledges that, indeed, the
tools at our disposal may no longer be adequate to respond to the problems
that we face. As soon as, indeed, we have concluded this process we will,
as this House, be looking at a Bill intended to ensure that we have proper
legislation in place in order to deal with the crime of terrorism. It's a
must, and it's one of the necessary tools that we must have. So,
makabulelwe uMsholozi. [Let Msholozi be thanked.] Thank you very much. Kea
leboga. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson, hon members, Ministers, comrades and
friends, I rise today on behalf of the ANC in unconditional support of the
Budget Vote of the Department of Justice.

As members are aware, the committee on justice is constitutionally enjoined
and mandated to perform two core functions: firstly, to perform its task as
a legislative authority in respect of legislation falling within the line
function of the department; secondly, to perform its oversight functions
and activities over the same department.

In the first few years the committee mainly concentrated on those functions
emanating from our legislative task and over the last nine years we have
passed 105 pieces of legislation, which comprises 3,3% of the legislation
passed by this Parliament since 1994. In the last few years the committee
has shifted gear and extended our work in respect of our oversight
functions and activities, mainly in the form of public hearings, especially
annually during the Budget Vote, and various oversight visits to the
institutions administering justice. More recently, we have also extended
these oversight visits beyond institutions administering justice to include
those that form the core of the criminal justice system.

In May 2003, three delegations of our committee and the correctional
services committee undertook cluster oversight visits to Johannesburg,
Durban and Port Elizabeth for a week and a half, examining all aspects of
the functioning of the criminal justice system in each of these cities in a
holistic and integrated manner. These visits were incredibly insightful in
identifying blockages in the criminal justice system, and engaging the
relevant role-players at grass-roots level in respect of possible
solutions.

Yes, we have many problems and yes, the system does not always function
well or, even occasionally, at all. But let us not deny the fact that every
day thousands of people work very hard, giving their utmost under very
difficult circumstances, to make the criminal justice system work. In a few
instances such efforts are either excellent or woeful, but in most
instances they range from good to satisfactory, amounting to a criminal
justice system which at least 90% of the time operates satisfactorily.

For this we owe a large debt of gratitude to the thousands of men and women
who every day make this happen. I have found many of them to be honest,
hardworking, patriotic South Africans who want to make our country a better
place for all to live in, and are open to dialogue to find new and creative
ways to make the criminal justice system function optimally. Particularly
encouraging is the enthusiasm with which they have embraced our oversight
work, both during public hearings and oversight visits, taking the
opportunity to engage in our striving to find solutions to the myriad of
problems facing us in the establishment of a properly functioning system.

In line with this approach, the committee has spent the last two weeks,
from early morning to early evening, building on our oversight work and
activities in public hearings with all the business units of the
department, the Chief Justice and his delegation, the prosecuting
authority, the Legal Aid Board, the Chapter 9 institutions and certain
boards. Many of these 10 days were spent with the department, the Chief
Justice and his delegation and the prosecuting authority, examining the
administration, functioning, performance and productivity of our courts.

These public hearings were participatory and consultative in nature and, in
my view, of a high quality, tackling the problems we face in our courts
with honesty, openness and integrity, with the emphasis on reaching
consensus around possible solutions. So much so that the Chief Justice
requested that we institutionalise the annual appearance of the judiciary
and the magistracy before this committee. We agreed and informed the Chief
Justice that the committee would, furthermore, respond positively to any
requests for him to appear before the committee in respect of any issue he
wished to address.

Against this background, you would then understand my enormous surprise on
Friday evening when I was called to comment on a rather hysterical attack
on these public hearings. The statement apparently emanated from the hon
Judge Hlophe and five judges president. It surprisingly firstly alleged
that the justice committee and Government, during the course of the
performance of our oversight functions in the last two weeks, had somehow
interfered in the judiciary and undermined the independence of the
judiciary. Secondly, they unleashed a scathing and unwarranted attack on
the Minister for allegedly not defending them against these attacks.

Closer scrutiny of this statement reveals the following interesting facts:
The Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice, as leaders of the judiciary, as
well as our most senior judges, have not been cosignatories to this
statement. Secondly, they have repudated and undermined the authority of
the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice's leadership in the
judiciary, by abrogating for themselves the mantle of spokespersons of the
judiciary and by way of the obvious bypassing and sidelining of their
leaderships views in respect of this very critical issue.

Thirdly, the obvious omission from the statement that the leader of the
judiciary, the Chief Justice, and his delegation had appeared before the
committee for more than five hours the previous Monday and had amicably and
without becoming hysterical engaged with members of the committee on all
the issues that are now being raised by Judge Hlophe as an interference in
the judiciary, stating the official position of the judiciary on all these
issues clearly and unequivocally. I have a press statement here in which
the Chief Justice responded on his visit and he said he had been treated
there with nothing but courtesy and had not come across any comments that
suggested members of the committee lacked respect for the judiciary. That
is the Chief Justice.

Fourthly, the absence of even a single example of any member of the justice
committee having tried to interfere with the exercise of the judicial
functions of any judicial officer. Fifthly, all the so-called complaints
merely relate to the members of the committee performing their oversight
role during a public meeting in respect of the administrative, as opposed
to the judicial, functions of our courts, as well as the efficient and
effective functioning of the courts. The drafters of the statement relied
for the facts on which they launched this attack entirely on the content of
the media report, without trying to contact or verify any aspect they may
have taken umbrage to with either the Minister, the chairperson or any
member of the committee.

I strongly reject any suggestion or insinuation that the justice committee
or any of its members during the recent public hearings were or are
``involved in scurrilous attacks on the independence, integrity and dignity
of the judiciary'', that we ``form part of an insidious attempt to
undermine the independence of the judiciary'', are ``part of an insinuation
that judges are lazy, overpaid and that they need any form of supervision
of politicians'' or in fact that the committee is involved in any other
imaginary or fanciful plot or subversive activity against any judicial
officer, the judiciary or its independence.

I want to further unequivocally reject any suggestion or insinuation that
the committee, I as chairperson or any member of my committee, at any stage
during the performance of our oversight functions, interfered or tried to
interfere in the exercise of any judicial officer's performance of his or
her judicial functions. The track record of the judicial committee and
Government speaks for itself since the advent of democracy. This Government
has assiduously, since 1994, been removing any impediments or obstacles,
legislatively or administratively, which could be seen as undermining the
independence of the judiciary, and which are legacies of apartheid.

Our vision and stated policy has been the establishment of a single
judiciary which fully adheres to and respects the constitutional injunction
of the independence of the judiciary. I can state without any fear of
contradiction that at no stage during the history of the judiciary of this
country has the independence of the judiciary been so firmly entrenched,
promoted and upheld as has been the case in the last few years. I,
therefore, challenge any judicial officer or person who alleges even one
instance of any politician interfering in the performance of the judicial
functions of a judicial officer to step forward and inform us of such an
instance. Obviously the statement of the judges does not contain such a
specific averment.

I am very surprised that these judges president still do not seem to be
aware of the definitive pronouncement of our Constitutional Court in
respect of issues like the separation of powers between the three branches
of government, especially the independence of the judiciary and the correct
approach to be adopted by the respective branches of government in their
interactions with each other, especially relating to public pronouncements.
In the judgments, inter alia, of Saapil and Van Rooyen, these issues were
fully canvassed and pronounced upon by the Constitutional Court.

Our Constitution, as confirmed by the Constitutional Court, rejects the
notion of an absolute separation of powers - as is to be found in the
United States - between the judiciary and other branches of government.
Obviously, on the one hand, the independence of the judiciary in South
Africa means that no one may interfere with the performance of any judicial
function, by any judicial officer. When it comes to the judicial functions
of the courts, presiding officers are only accountable to the Constitution
and the law, and of course their conscience. On the other hand, in South
Africa, differently from the United States, the situation is different when
it comes to the performance of the administrative functions of the courts,
or to put it differently, the effective and efficient functioning of our
courts; in other words, what the taxpayers' money is spent on in the
courts.

These include issues like the capacity and productivity of our courts.
Legally, the director-general of the department is held accountable for the
functioning, administration and performance of our courts. This, of course,
needs to be done in a sensible and flexible manner, with the participation
of and whilst consulting with the judiciary. Therefore, when it comes to
the administration and functioning of our courts, it is the preserve of the
department to fulfil these functions in the manner described below, and not
like in the United States where the courts themselves do so through their
own independent administration.

I had thought that this debate had been laid to rest during the negotiation
of our Constitution. However, there are still a few voices in our judiciary
who advocate the introduction of the US model of separation of powers. Of
course, it is their democratic right to do so. The matter, however, becomes
problematic when they not only advocate their preferred option, but
actually conduct themselves in such a manner as to suggest that we have
such an absolute separation of powers in South Africa. Much of the present
imbroglio, consciously or subconsciously, seems to stem from this flawed
ideological point of departure.

Therefore, the justice committee annually - for the past 10 years, I may
add - has engaged with the department and the judiciary and the magistracy
through public hearings and oversight visits with all aspects of the
administration, functioning and performance of our courts, including issues
of capacity and productivity. We perform these oversight functions we are
enjoined to perform in terms of the Constitution and the Rules of
Parliament, with all the necessary sensitivity, diligence and vigour,
without fear or favour.

I am not sure what precipitated this unprecedented and unseemly
intervention this year, when this has been an annual event of the justice
committee for the last 10 years, especially as the judiciary and the
magistracy have willingly and enthusiastically participated in this
oversight work of the committee for the last few years. If, as we are being
accused of, the justice committee is busy interfering in the judiciary and
undermining its independence, why would the Chief Justice and his
delegation not only appear before the committee in the last few years,
including this year, but in fact request the committee to institutionalise
these activities? Why is it that we have encountered such widespread
support and endorsement of our oversight activities of the administration
and functioning of all aspects of our courts from the Chief Justice down to
the most junior judicial officers, but we now have a few judges president
inexplicably and intractably opposed to these salutary oversight practices?

What has precipitated this brouhaha, which has led these judges to arrive
at these high-sounding and incorrect conclusions like ``scurrilous
attacks'', ``insidious attempts'', ``plots'', ``interference in the
judiciary'' and ``utterances of ill-informed politicians''. From the media
report there appears to be four issues that have raised these judges' blood
pressure, and have led to these intemperate, ill-informed, ill-considered
and most unfortunate statements and conclusions which are unbecoming of a
member of the judiciary. I will deal with all these issues to set the
record straight, but I must point out that all three these issues were
fully canvassed with and responded to by the Chief Justice himself and his
delegation.

With regard to the sitting hours of our courts, our courts are supposed to
be in session for five to six hours each day. However, at present our
criminal courts, on average, are only in session as follows: at High Court
level, three hours and twenty-five minutes; at regional court level, three
hours and fifty-two minutes; and at district court level, four hours and
five minutes.

Everybody, including the Chief Justice, is in agreement that this is a
totally unacceptable state of affairs at all levels of our courts. In fact,
much of our discussion with the department and the Chief Justice's
delegation centred on the reasons for this state of affairs and possible
solutions or remedial action. A myriad of causes were identified. At no
stage did anyone suggest that judicial officers are the only or even the
main cause for this state of affairs, nor did anyone say or insinuate that
laziness or incompetence on the part of the judicial officers had anything
to do with this state of affairs. In fact, it was readily acknowledged that
judicial officers find themselves at the end of the court process, and have
a limited impact on delays or postponements.

The approach of the Chief Justice in this regard was readily acceptable,
namely, that the judicial officers must take full control and
responsibility for their courts. At present this is not always the case.
Judicial officers must be responsible for their courts strictly commencing
on time and adjourning at the end of the day. If any person is responsible
for any delay, they should be brought before the court and fully account
for their actions; this should be recorded and, if necessary, the necessary
disciplinary action should be taken against them. I share the view that it
is in this regard that judicial officers should share the responsibility
for the unacceptably low hours actually spent in court receiving evidence.
They must assert their control over their courts. It has got nothing to do
with laziness or incompetence.

I also have many other issues. I've dealt with the salaries and the recess
of courts, if anyone is interested, and the impropriety in respect of
Saturday courts. If any of you are interested to look at this and what the
committee actually has suggested and has proposed, you are more than
welcome to read this. I'll happily give it to you. [Interjections.]

Well, maybe you'll be able to then at least be able to interact properly
with the debate. For example, some members on this side haven't.

Let me deal with my conclusion. It is obviously unprecedented and highly
undesirable that these judges choose to make these serious allegations of
interference in the judiciary through the media based merely on the content
of media reports, without referring to the Minister or the committee, or
even the President if they so wish, to clarify or verify any issue with
which they may take umbrage. After all, the stock in trade of a judicial
officer is to be a finder of fact. One can only speculate why they ignored
every tenet of their training and profession in this instance.

Even more worrying and insidious is their obvious repudiation of or
dismissive approach exemplified in respect of the leadership of the
judiciary in the form of the Chief Justice. When dealing with these issues
surrounding the independence of the judiciary, and particularly allegations
of interference in the judiciary by politicians, surely all judicial
officers should take their cue from their leaders in the judiciary and
allow them to deal with such matters. The judiciary should in these
instances speak with one voice.

Our Constitution provides clearly that the Chief Justice and the Deputy
Chief Justice are the leaders of the judiciary and the magistracy. If
fellow judicial officers, especially judges president, do not protect and
uphold the Constitution, and do not respect and uphold the authority of the
Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice to act on behalf of and speak on
behalf of the judiciary, especially in respect of matters affecting its
independence, why do they expect the rest of the citizenry to do so? It
does not matter how important, indispensable or aggrieved you regard
yourself to be, no one is above the Constitution or above the law. It is
unthinkable that certain of our judges president should so blatantly
undermine the authority, the standing and leadership of the Chief Justice
and the Deputy Chief Justice.

It is further imperative that the justice committee, and even Parliament as
a whole, are not to be intimidated or cowed into submission by such
unwarranted, unmandated and hysterical accusations by a few judges acting
clearly without the apparent endorsement of the Chief Justice.
[Interjections.] [Applause.] No matter how shrill and hysterical the
outburst, we must be guided by the facts in this whole saga and not
emotions. The justice committee and Parliament cannot accept or countenance
a situation or any suggestion that any person or institution is above the
law, or the Constitution, or that they are totally unaccountable.

Even judges are and should be held accountable, obviously not for the
performance of their judicial functions, but most definitely for their
role, duties and responsibilities within the administration, functioning
and the performance of our courts, which are, after all, funded by
taxpayers' money. And of course they are accountable for their conduct in
and out of court, which may amount to a transgression of the judicial code
of ethics or any conduct unbecoming a judge, which may lead to disciplinary
action. To this extent, the justice committee, and Parliament, cannot allow
its constitutionally mandated oversight functions, as described above, over
the functioning and performance of our courts to be limited or watered down
because it causes some individual judicial officers some discomfort.

I must say that I hope that this will put an end to this very unseemly and
unnecessary and unwarranted intervention that we've had over the last time.
The justice committee and Parliament, with the participation of people like
Dr Delport, Mrs Sheila Camerer and members from the other parties,
vigorously every year engage the judiciary on these issues, and every year
there has not been a problem. Suddenly one or two persons, who think
themselves to be the self-appointed spokespersons of the judiciary, find
that they should intervene like this. This is wrong and it's unbecoming.

The authority of the Chief Justice, as the head of the judiciary, should  be
respected. We as a committee will keep on  upholding  and  building  on  the
independence of the judiciary. But there's an old story: When you  grew  up,
as a child, I think everyone's father and mother used to say, ``You are  not
given respect, you have to earn respect''. And I think our judiciary  should
also learn this.

Let me  say  when  I  say  ``judiciary''  I  mean  certain  members  of  the
judiciary, because  the  point  is  that  we  have  found  through  all  our
oversight work that the vast majority of  judicial  officers  do  not  agree
with this kind of conduct. The vast majority of judicial  officers  in  this
country do an honest day's work and try and make our courts  function  every
day, and we should not let ourselves be  distracted  by  a  few  individuals
that feel that they would not want to do so and would not want to  be  under
the authority of the Chief Justice.

I really am sorry that this is what has to happen  in  this  debate,  but  I
think we have to set the record straight on what has happened  in  the  last
few days. As I say, I have  fully  responded  in  this  speech  to  all  the
accusations  that  have  been  made  against  us.  Thank  you   very   much.
[Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chair, I am going to speak to the  theme:  The  withering
of the spirit of the Constitution. The hon Nelson Mandela  correctly  called
the Constitution a foundation which would remain but just  that,  unless  we
build thereon. [Interjections.]

His vision was to derive strength, trust and unity  from  the  diversity  of
our languages, religions and cultural attributes.  ``Everybody  should  feel
part and parcel of our efforts to resolve the problems  of  South  Africa'',
he said.

Our Constitution was born from the hopes and dreams and  ideals  that  lived
and still live in the hearts and minds of our people.  That  is  the  matrix
from which it arose. That is the spirit of the Constitution.

There is no doubt that Mr  Mandela  was  dedicated  to  the  creation  of  a
rainbow nation, a nation where everyone enjoyed  fair  and  equal  treatment
and was free to live  and  work  and  achieve.  That  spirit  is  withering.
[Interjections.]

Firstly,  respect  for  the  judiciary  -  the  Constitution   secures   the
independence of the judiciary. The spirit of the Constitution, on the  other
hand, requires the enhancement of respect for the judiciary. That  is  being
undermined. Secondly, there is a move from affirmative action  to  so-called
transformation.  The  Constitution  allows  what  is   commonly   known   as
affirmative action - special measures to  develop  previously  disadvantaged
persons to reach their potential and  thus  achieve  the  enjoyment  of  all
rights and freedoms. This has our support.

Nowhere, however, in the Constitution do we find that discrimination on  the
basis of colour or creed is allowed. And that is exactly what  is  presently
being done in the name of transformation -  a  term  which  is  a  political
term, not a constitutionally protected one.

For example: The Magistrates Commission  shortlists  applicants  by  way  of
awarding points. I have an extract from their  recent  minutes.  They  award
points: three for experience; two for qualifications; three  for  race;  and
three for gender. If,  therefore,  the  preference  is  given  to  a  female
applicant of a particular race,  other  candidates  can  achieve  only  five
points, whereas those of the chosen race and gender immediately  obtain  six
points. [Interjections.]
Secondly, Resolution 7 of 2002 is being abused. In the  Eastern  Cape  white
officials  are  scattered,  irrespective  of  the  merits  and  of  personal
circumstances. A husband is transferred to one town, his  wife  to  another.
Do those affected feel, in the words of Mr Mandela, that he or she  is  part
and parcel of our efforts to resolve the problems of South Africa?  Is  this
the rainbow nation? Is it when Popcru objects  to  promotions,  not  because
the appointees are unfit for office, but because they are  white?  And  when
policemen have to obtain  court  orders  to  get  the  promotions  they  are
entitled to? [Interjections.]

A last example: A proper support programme for disadvantaged sportsmen
would have achieved equality in sport with the wholehearted and
enthusiastic support of all South Africans. But the hon Balfour says
transformation is more important than winning. He imposes quotas. He says
transformation overrides all other considerations. And what is the effect
on those sportsmen who are denied the honour of reaching the top because of
the Balfour policy? Must they accept that they are less than equal because
of the colour of their skin? Is that not the very crude discrimination
which the new Constitution wishes to destroy, never to rise again?

There is another move from freedom of religion to religious neutrality.
Minister Kader Asmal says religions must be taught, not practised, in
schools. The thrust of his policy is to educate the generation who
subscribes to and is schooled in religious neutrality. Is that in line with
Mr Mandela's views that we must gain strength from the tapestry of our
religions? [Interjections.]

From land restitution it is another move to land redistribution. Section 25
of the Constitution contains the principles of our land policy. Now
legislation is tabled which is clearly the first step towards expropriation
- pure and simple. This shift is not only an attack on the spirit of the
Constitution, it represents an attack on the very foundation of an economic
policy based on the security of ownership.

I conclude. we must not allow the Constitution to be undermined. Equally
important, we must not allow the spirit of the Constitution to be ignored
or weakened. [Interjections.] On the contrary, we call upon the Government
to embrace that spirit as the guiding star which will, for sure, guide
South Africa to greatness. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I associate the IFP with the
appreciation expressed to the Minister and his department and others for
doing a good job. With exceptions here and there, we support the Budget
Vote.

I wish to deal with only two matters, and then my colleague, Mr Vezi, will
deal with other matters. The first issue I wish to raise is the inability
of the Justice department to effectively deal with trial-awaiting
prisoners. This problem is not a new one, and by now we should have found a
permanent solution.

The worst effect of this solution is, of course, the overcrowding in
prisons, where basic human rights are simply absent. I do not want to dwell
on the awful and disastrous conditions caused by the overcrowding. What I
do want to emphasise is the very wise and true saying which points an
accusing finger at all of us: Show me the inside of your prisons and I will
show you the level of your civilisation.

I sincerely hope that this problem will in future be tackled with definite
plans, such as the Minister has told us about, and with conviction and
determination and hard work. From our side, the IFP offers to assist as far
as we can. The second aspect I wish to deal with is the extremely
unfortunate public street fight between the justice portfolio committee,
the judges and the Minister of Justice.

I was shocked by the fact that the people at the pinnacle of our justice
system could allow themselves to be dragged into this unnecessary dogfight.
No one applied the brakes. They just took off emotionally, all three of
them. As far as we are concerned, all three parties are to be blamed for
bringing justice into disrepute.

The portfolio chairperson, who is an excellent chairperson, whom I have
been acquainted with for almost 10 years, unfortunately should have been
more sensitive, less of a rammetjie-uitnek [swaggerer] and less emotional,
as he was today. I want to say to him: ``Johnny, jy moet kalm word, man.
[Johnny, you have to calm down, man.]'' He overreacted so much that, in
rugby language, he tried to score, place and drop. And I think that was the
big mistake. I think Johnny should cool down.

The judges, on the other hand, should certainly have sought another
dignified method to air their grievances. But lastly, the hon Minister
should not have become a boxer in this ring. Instead, he should have been
the wise man who calmed everyone down and put the matter to rest. I know he
was a boxer in his young days. But now you are old. You have to pacify
them, hon Minister. [Interjections.] You did not stop Johnny de Lange who
was kicking, dropping and placing. You should have stopped him and pacified
him. You should have relied on the Chief Justice to do this. The Chief
Justice, thank God for that, played the wise, sensible and unemotional
role. And to him we wish to say: ``Tien uit tien, regter Chaskalson.'' [Ten
out of ten, Judge Chaskalson.]''

As a member of the Judicial Services Commission, I think the hon Chief
Justice should consider a discussion of this matter at a session of the
commission. All three of the parties of contestants are represented in the
commission, namely, Mr de Lange, the hon Minister and some judges. That
would be much more sensible and would achieve much more than a humiliating
street fight.

Our judgment is as follows: All three parties are guilty of unwise action.
We caution and discharge them on condition that we never see a judicial
street fight again. And finally, we wish the Minister and all persons
associated with the judiciary a wonderful new year - but never again a
dogfight.
Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Chairperson and hon members, let me begin by saying a
few things on behalf of the ANC study group, which our chairperson does not
know I am going to do, by the way.

The ANC study group, comrade Johnny, wants you to know that we completely
and totally support you in your stance on this matter. [Applause.] We are
agreed that you have been singled out by certain members of the judiciary,
because your stance is our stance. It is the job of Parliament to oversee
all public bodies, and the courts, the last time I checked, were public
bodies. We will continue to do our work as Parliamentarians and we will
continue to do so proudly, because those who suffer as a result of
inefficiencies are the victims of crime, women and children.

In order to function optimally, the criminal justice system relies on many
different role-players, as the Minister has said in his speech. In court
there's a presiding officer, a prosecutor, a legal representative, an
interpreter, a bailiff, witnesses and, depending on the nature of the case,
social workers, district surgeons, forensic and other experts. The absence
or unpreparedness of any one of these individuals can cause a delay in the
trial and its postponement. [Interjections.]

We don't often ... Sorry, is that better, Ntombazana? We don't often
realise that much of what goes on in the criminal justice system has
everything to do with matters that happen outside the courtroom. The
criminal justice system, in any society, is a conveyor belt of interlinked
processes and role-players.

I wish to spend the rest of the time allocated to me, speaking about the
crucial role played by sister departments at the beginning and at the end
of the criminal justice system conveyor belt. This I will do with specific
reference, where appropriate, to experiences we have had during our most
recent oversight visits, together with members who serve on the
correctional services portfolio committee.

Beginning with the Department of Safety and Security, we were privileged,
as it has been said, to meet some of the finest South Africans during our
visit. It served to remind us that, even while we are constantly bombarded
with the idea that our police are inefficient and even corrupt, a typical
average policeman or policewoman's profile is that of a hardworking,
committed, dedicated South African, committed to serving the public, often
under very dangerous circumstances.

The emphasis on training in the police service is very telling. The first
thing the delegation to the Eastern Cape was briefed on, without any
prompting from us, was how many police had received specialised training
and how many had not. This emphasis on training is particularly gratifying
to us. However, much still remains to be done.

The police service has pockets of excellence, and these are generally found
in the specialised units. The biggest challenge lies with the general
investigation units. These units, by and large, do all investigations
pertaining to matters other than those allocated to specialised units. The
real backlogs are experienced here, and it doesn't help that most of the
experienced policemen and women avoid placement at these units because of
the uncomfortable case loads and the sparse resources. Again, we think that
training is crucial and that there needs to be a serious look at the kind
of resources allocated to these units.

The second area of concern relates to the criminal record centres. These
are where the SAP 69s are produced. Where an arrested person has no
previous convictions, an SAP 69 can be produced within 48 hours. However,
it sometimes takes up to 40 days.

It also seems, from what we were told, that there are very few fingerprint
identification experts in the country. Many of our experienced people have
either retired or have been poached by foreign countries. No doubt, our
police force is still evolving and will continue to evolve for a while, but
there are encouraging aspects and, already, there are signs of a world
class outfit.

Let me now turn to some of the other role-players on the conveyor belt. The
accused person, having been arrested by a member of the police force, now
appears before the relevant magistrate and requests bail. The judicial
officer finds, inter alia, that there is no flight risk and grants the
person bail at a stipulated amount.

In the Port Elizabeth area, we found that 24 people who were given bail
amounting to less than R100, were sitting in prison. Up to 256 people were
doing the same, having been granted bail of less than R200, and 775 people
were imprisoned because they could not afford bail of less than R500. A
further 139 people were sitting in prison because of the fact that they
could not afford to pay R1 000 set by the judicial officer. This totals a
whopping 1 194 who are behind bars, not because they are a threat to
society or because they pose a flight risk, but because they are poor.
[Interjections.] No, you were not here five years ago. You can't count.

These people account for 41,79% of all awaiting-trial prisoners in the PE
area. One should, at this point, bear in mind that it is cheaper for the
State to pay bail bonds for these categories of people than to pay for
their continued incarceration.

It is clear that the amendment this Parliament passed to enable the Head of
Prisons, together with the prosecutors, to bring an application for the
release of these individuals, had not been used prior to our visit. We
understand that in the three provinces visited by the delegation, such
applications petitioning the release of these individuals will be made, if
they haven't already begun.

That this situation could have been avoided had our courts adopted a more
responsible approach to bail applications, is clear. May we, amidst the
current hue and cry from our very eminent and very independent judiciary,
suggest very humbly that there is a better and more responsible way of
doing things.
At a bail hearing, when someone is found to be neither a flight risk, nor a
risk to society, there should be some enquiry into his or her capacity to
pay the bail set by the presiding officer. Our prisons are not meant to
hold people simply because they are poor. The Department of Correctional
Services tells us that our prisons are overcrowded. This is not news, but
this is a serious matter that requires serious solutions in this
constitutional state. We simply cannot have prisons that are 170% full or
219% full, as was reported by the delegation that visited KZN. Anyone who
has not visited our prisons cannot understand the extent of the
infringement on human dignity that overcrowding leads to.

However, when one sees children, nine to 12 years old, idling away the
hours in these prisons, one can't believe that it bodes well for our future
as a country. Prisons are not places for children to be in. However, the
Department of Social Welfare and Development does not have sufficient
secure care facilities for children, and so they stay in prison.
In the PE area alone, there were 291 children awaiting trial in prison.
These are children who should not be there. These children are being
exposed to all kinds of criminal and inhumane elements in those cold and
miserable cells. More disturbing is the fate of 31 children who were
originally sentenced to reform schools, but who have been in prison, some
of them for up to four years - four years in prison - because there are no
reform schools in the province of the Eastern Cape.

That urgent intervention is required in such matters cannot be
overstressed. A national audit, Minister, I believe, is urgently required
between the justice, correctional services, social welfare and education
sectors, and children sentenced to reform schools should be placed in
proper schools, so that we never again have to have the loss of a child's
whole future on our conscience.

While in the Eastern Cape, we found no secure care facilities for girl
children or young women. This means that every time a woman has to await
trial, she has to do so in prison. On the issue of reform schools again, in
the Gauteng province, we were told, there are no reform schools for girls
and young women. If this is the current situation in Gauteng, then there's
every possibility that the situation in other provinces is equally dire.

My time is limited, so let me conclude by saying that each department
within the criminal justice cluster is a vital part of the conveyor belt.
Though in some cases they have established formal links, the time has now
come to establish formal protocols, and we want to dedicate our time for
the rest of the year to actually drafting these protocols in Parliament. We
hope we have your support for that, Minister. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

Adv D M BAKKER: Chairperson, this budget debate comes at a time when
several controversial issues regarding our justice system are dominating
the front pages of our newspapers. Although these controversial issues also
need to be debated, we cannot afford our focus to be shifted from other,
even more urgent, matters.
After an absence of more than four years at portfolio committee meetings,
it was interesting to attend some of the recent budget hearings. My initial
reaction was that of shock and a sense that nothing had changed.

The hon chairperson of the committee, as he again proved today, was still
tearing the department's officials, and the hon Camerer, apart. Although
the hon Camerer's treatment might be just, the same can, very fortunately,
not be said about the department and its officials. I soon realised that
this budget is the result of proper, innovative and careful planning.

Dit is geensins verbasend dat die VSA se departement van justisie met groot
lof van ons departement praat nie. 'n Donasie van R160 miljoen vanaf die
VSA in Augustus verlede jaar is baie goed aangewend, en die departement se
``justice footprint'' word tereg beskryf as 'n inisiatief van die hoogste
standaard. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is by no means surprising that the USA's department of justice speaks
very highly of our department. A donation of R160 million from the USA in
August last year has been employed very productively, and the department's
``justice footprint'' is rightly described as an initiative of the highest
standard.]

This initiative includes the production of detailed maps that display the
courts throughout the country, and reflect the most up to date position
regarding their respective workloads and the levels of crime in each area.
Combined with this is a financial model that identifies every single item
of expenditure, prioritises the expenditure and ensures the identification
of specific areas where financial support will have the greatest impact to
achieve the best results in the fight against crime.

Die departement se toegewydheid wys op 'n determinasie om misdaad te bekamp
en veiliger gemeenskappe te bevorder. Hiervoor moet die Minister en sy hele
departement, asook alle ander rolspelers, veral Business against Crime,
gelukgewens en ten sterkste aangemoedig word. [The department's dedication
indicates a determination to fight crime and to promote safer communities.
For this the Minister and his whole department, as well as other role-
players, especially Business against Crime, must be congratulated and most
strongly encouraged.]

Whilst recognising some of the department's very good achievements, it is
also true that our transformation and restructuring have not yet met all
the challenges it is faced with. Many people are still weary of the changes
and are not experiencing a swift, effective, accessible and efficient
criminal justice system.

In the words of our Chief Justice:


  The criminal justice system is like a chain - a problem in one link of
  the chain creates huge backlogs and unnecessary delays along the line.

Daar is ongelukkig nog baie skakels wat probleme verskaf. Sonder om
betrokke te wil raak by die huidige kontroversie oor die onafhanklikheid
van die regbank, is dit tog noodsaaklik dat die produktiwiteit van ons
howe, in veral strafregsake, aangespreek word.

Is dit grondwetlik dat verhoorafwagtendes vir tot vier jaar aangehou word
voordat hul verhore afgehandel word? Wat van hul grondwetlike reg op 'n
spoedige verhoor? Is dit menslik dat die slagoffers van seksuele misdrywe
'n tweede keer voor howe gesleep word om weer te kom getuig oor die
afskuwelike dade wat teen hulle gepleeg is nadat beskuldigdes in streekhowe
reeds skuldig bevind is? In sommige gevalle gebeur dit selfs 18 maande
nadat hulle die eerste keer getuienis gelewer het.

Hoekom moet getuies tot vyf en meer kere hof toe kom vir onnodige
uitstelle? Waarom neem strafsake in die hoërhowe gemiddeld meer as 18
maande om afgehandel te word, en waarom is daar meer as 2 000
verhoorafwagtendes onder 18 jaar in aanhouding? Waarom word meer sake
teruggetrek as wat afgehandel word? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Unfortunately there are still my links that cause problems. Without
wanting to become involved in the current controversy about the
independence of the judiciary, it is nevertheless necessary that the
productivity of our courts, especially regarding criminal cases, be
addressed.

Is it constitutional for persons awaiting-trials to be detained for up to
four years before their trials are finalised? What about their
constitutional right to a speedy trial? Is it human for the victims of
sexual crimes to be dragged before courts for a second time, to once again
testify about the heinous deeds which have been perpetrated against them,
after the accused have already been found guilty in regional courts? In
some instances this even happens 18 months after they have testified for
the first time.

Why must witnesses come to court five or more times for unnecessary
postponements? Why do criminal cases in the higher courts on average take
more than 18 months to be completed, and why are there more than 2 000
awaiting-trial prisoners under 18 years of age in detention? Why are more
cases withdrawn than finalised?]

The question remains: Who is responsible for sorting out the criminal
justice system? According to the Chief Justice, the responsibility lies
with the police, the judiciary and correctional services. He also says that
delays are a cause for concern for the whole judiciary, and he agrees that
statistics should be updated and analysed by all the relevant role-players.

Our Constitution states that the National Assembly must - not can, must -
provide for mechanisms to maintain oversight of the exercise of national
executive authority and any organ of state.

An integrated approach to fighting crime means that all role-players are
interdependent. The police, judges, magistrates, prosecutors and
correctional services are all part of the chain, and a problem in one link
makes the whole chain ineffective.

There are several other matters that need to be addressed urgently, like
corruption and theft in our courts and in the prosecuting authority, but in
the limited time available I would like to focus on the row over the new
section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

The mere fact that this amendment was approved almost five years ago and
has still not been put into effect, illustrates that there is definitely a
serious perception problem. Clearly, this issue needs to be resolved
urgently so that both the police and the general public can know where they
stand. As long as there is a perception amongst the police that they are
under threat, there is a problem. The way to solve the problem is for all
role-players to agree to amending the section in order to deal with the
perceived threat to the police.

Unlike the DP/DA, my party voted against the amendment, because we believed
that the amendment should not have introduced a normative concept of fault.
It should rather have placed arresting officers and private individuals on
the same footing, and adhered to the normal principles of liability or
absence of mens rea, as well as the onus of proof.

A small amendment can rectify this. Then, the new section 49 will place
sufficient emphasis on the protection of the suspects' rights, and
carefully balance these rights against the interests of the arresting
officers and the administration of justice. In this way we can further
enhance the integrated approach to fighting crime. I thank you.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before proceeding with the debate, I have an
announcement to make. I have to announce that Mr M F Cassim has vacated his
seat in the National Assembly with effect from today, as his membership of
the Peace and Justice Congress has been terminated. The Office of Deputy
Chairperson of Committees has also been vacated. We will now proceed with
the debate.

Ms N MAHLAWE: Madam Speaker, hon members, on Friday, 13 June the hon member
Mrs Shilubana made a spine-chilling statement. She said that a man in
Limpopo had savagely assaulted his wife, thereby cracking her skull. The
woman died after she had been in a coma for a number of years.

We have read stories about human trafficking involving girls and women in
the country and abroad. We all know the story of baby Tshepang, who was
brutally raped by an elderly man. In the Eastern Cape a matric female
student was abducted last year, gang-raped and repeatedly run over by a car
until she died. A number of stories have been read about the rape of
elderly women above the age of 70, and many have been killed in some
provinces because they have been accused of witchcraft. We can go beyond
the borders of this country and cite the story of the Nigerian woman, Amina
Lawal, who has been sentenced to death by stoning for bearing a child
outside of marriage. The question is: Where is the man who impregnated her?

We can go on ad infinitum with stories of victims of abuse who are all
mostly children, women of all ages, the aged and people with disabilities.
The Department of Justice and Constitutional Affairs collectively name
these the vulnerable groups. I am going to closely examine measures that
have been and are being taken by the department to address this endemic
problem and link it, in my discussion, with the work of sexual offences
courts and the work that is being done by the National Directorate of
Public Prosecutions.

Before I can endeavour to enter into this, allow me to make observations on
some realities which hamper the good intentions of the department. Firstly,
the victimisation and sexual abuse of vulnerable groups occur within the
home, in the community. It takes place in various forms, like assault,
harassment, child rape, forced early marriages, genital mutilation,
femicide, feminisation of poverty and low levels of literacy. Secondly,
socioeconomic realities and limited access to and control over power and
productive resources make women more vulnerable to all forms of violence.
Thirdly, there is the existence of a strong veil of silence. Women are
subjected and socialised to multiple legal systems, traditions and customs,
and these create a major obstacle to a holistic and comprehensive approach
to deal with this problem.

Communities are sometimes not properly sensitised about available remedies
from and by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development. I
should also mention the lack of a co-ordinated approach by the various
departments who have stakes in addressing these problems. For instance,
safety and security, correctional services and the courts do not work
together at all times to ensure speedy and effective handling of domestic
violence cases and trials of juveniles. This issue of juveniles has been
raised here - I don't have to go into it again.

Added to this are the Chapter 9 institutions, like the Commission for
Gender Equality and the SA Human Rights Commission, who are doing good
work, but which most of the time do this work separately from their
counterparts in the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development.
There are generally widespread claims that the police do not arrive
timeously when summoned to incidents of domestic violence. Reasons being
cited include a lack of transport or a lack of personnel. This is not
acceptable.

Correctional services keep inmates as young as eight, 10 or 12 years of age
for a long time without trial. This has been alluded to, and I'm not going
to go into detail. Some of these children are detained for petty cases,
like stealing bread, food or cellular phones. A cluster-orientated approach
cannot be overemphasised.

The department is conducting multidisciplinary training seminars on sexual
offences in the provinces with funding received from the Canadian
International Development Agency, Cida, for a total of 370 delegates,
comprising prosecutors, police officials, NGO representatives, magistrates,
doctors and social workers. For rural areas to also benefit from this
process, Soca, together with the Department of Health, will train forensic
nurses to provide these crucial services to ensure that rural children and
women are not disadvantaged by their geographical positioning.

The specialist courts have led to speedier and more effective prosecutions
of sexual offences. The Thuthuzela Multidisciplinary Care Centre at G F
Jooste Hospital in Manenberg, Cape Town, was launched in July 2000 to
render services to survivors of gender-based crimes. Over a six-month
period a number of cases were processed at Thuthuzela. The pilot project
has proved to be a resounding success in the implementation of a victim-
centred approach.

With regard to the sexual offences section, the unit is in the process of
facilitating a national judges' summit which judges from the provincial
High Courts and regional courts will attend. The key participants to this
summit will also be judges from the United Kingdom, USA, Canada and Sweden.
The unit will host a workshop on child pornography in order to develop
expertise amongst prosecutors and investigators in the trafficking of child
porn images on the Internet, chat rooms on the Internet and in profiling
sex offenders. It will then build a data system of sex offenders and
investigate these cases.

The unit is looking forward to the establishment of multidisciplinary care
centres for victims of violence at the Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital, in
Ntlaza and in Thohoyandou. Preparations for the running of these centres
are in progress. There are public awareness campaigns in which the unit is
in the process of implementing a public information and education campaign
on sexual violence, and on ways of accessing the legal system. Cida will
provide funding for this campaign. The main objectives are to restore
public confidence in the criminal justice system, and to heighten public
intolerance of gender-based crimes by encouraging the reporting of these
offences.

With regard to domestic violence, the key function of the prosecutors in
the intervention process is to effectively prosecute the perpetrators of
domestic violence and to ensure that proper sentences are imposed. However,
the national policy directives on domestic violence extend this prosecution
role by instructing prosecutors to assist the victims of domestic violence,
when approached for advice, by advising them of the relief available to
them in terms of the Act.

The domestic violence section has as its priority focus the responsibility
to ensure the reduction of secondary victimisation within the prosecutorial
services, and to improve the conviction rate in these cases by establishing
prosecution-driven victim support centres within the court building which
will mainly respond to the needs of the victims in the criminal justice
system in a sensitive way.

In terms of the Maintenance Act everybody is forced to support his or her
own child. However, the unit has a section that oversees maintenance and
related issues. Eighty maintenance officer positions have been created by
the unit for prosecutors and 52 are already in place. Eleven courts that
look into maintenance for children were established in 2002. The target is
39.

A national plan of action is being developed to guide all sectors required
to implement the new Maintenance Act and to improve access to the
maintenance system. The unit has been involved in drafting the Victim
Charter, especially the sections dealing with service in the courts from
the magistrates, clerks, interpreters, court orderlies and, very
importantly, the prosecutors.

The Child Justice Bill is with the committee. The Bill looks at children,
because it is clear that we cannot and should not keep young children or
juveniles in prisons, otherwise we are creating a society that will be
regretted in future. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam
Speaker and hon members, this budget debate takes place against the
backdrop of yesterday's Youth Day celebrations and the recognition that
this particular sector of our population continues to find itself so
vulnerable to the vagaries of poverty, violence and crime. Nonetheless,
much has changed for the children and youth of this country since that
wintry Soweto Day in June 1976 when they took to the streets in a potent
demonstration of will and determination to achieve change and social
justice.

With the decade of democracy fast approaching, a review of justice system
reforms in South Africa since 1994 provides ample evidence of this
Government's determination to promote actively the interests of vulnerable
groups such as the elderly, urban and rural African women and especially
the interests of our children. Furthermore, by linking the process of
judicial and legal reform with the objectives of achieving a just and
equitable society, this Government acknowledges the centrality of the
justice system to the transformation of our national community.

It also firmly acknowledges that achieving a just and equitable social
order is a function of transformation within the judiciary and the justice
system itself. Additionally, this decade of reform has been achieved within
a framework of sustainability premised on a clear understanding that
today's resources should be utilised in a way that ensures that future
generations have sufficient means to meet their hopes and aspirations.

The connection between crime and poverty is well established, but more
significant perhaps, although less often mentioned, is the connection
between poverty and vulnerability to crime. Poor women and children are
more likely to be victimised, because they enjoy fewer protections, less
privacy and fewer resources. Similarly, their resilience in the face of
victimisation is considerably less, and they are less likely to get the
necessary assistance to overcome it. Interventions, therefore, that provide
protections for children, and the many caregivers who sustain them, are not
only fundamental to our justice system, they are indispensable to the long-
term development of this country's people.

Justice has a tangible role to play in poverty alleviation. Not
traditionally a component of justice's work, poverty alleviation is a
primary consideration in achieving a more effective and reliable
maintenance system. A well-administered system has the potential to release
significant numbers of women and children from the trap of poverty. If we
were to achieve a mere 50% improvement in accessing maintenance for
children, our department could make this one of the most significant
contributions to the social and economic development of children in this
country. In addition, we would be doing this without depleting the
resources of the state. Furthermore, it is our belief that efficient and
improved access to the maintenance system will reduce the burden on the
child support and grant system and empower women, children and whole
families in significant ways.

It is precisely because effective maintenance collection has the potential
to ameliorate the debilitating impact of poverty on vulnerable groups that
we are determined to make it work. Earlier this year our department
launched its revised maintenance outreach programme, which includes
educating people about their rights and responsibilities in respect of
maintenance and child support. About 400 000 illustrated booklets in all
the official languages have been distributed throughout the country, and
five pilot educational workshops for communities are underway. A national
roll-out campaign will begin once the pilot workshops have been evaluated.
The appointment of the first 55 maintenance investigators, who commenced
duty on 1 April, will complement the work of the additional maintenance
prosecutors, whom the NPA has already made available in our courts.

Effective maintenance and order enforcement is vital for the empowerment of
mothers and, of course, significantly improves the ability to provide
appropriately for their children. The effective prosecution of maintenance
defaulters is increasingly bringing the message home that failure to
observe maintenance orders will no longer be tolerated. It might be
apposite at this juncture to commend a Western Cape magistrate for the
innovative manner in which he has dealt with some defaulters. Acknowledging
the need for them to retain their own capacity, he has imposed periodic
sentences on defaulters. This means that they will serve their sentences
over weekends, thus allowing them to keep their jobs. Faced with the
prospect of several weekends in jail, many of the defaulters have
immediately settled all arrears.

We have entered into a public/private joint venture with the establishment
of two people's family law centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town, a third
is envisaged for Durban later this year. Specific protocols for case
management, client support and the early resolution of matters have been
tried in these centres and tested for similar application in our courts.
Law centre representatives and the department have established the task
team for a comparative review of our existing family courts and the family
law centres with a view to establishing best practice. Once this is
completed, it will be used as a basis for specific legislation to support
further roll out of family courts in future.

The task team has completed a blue print for a family court dispensation
and R17,4 million has been set aside for this purpose. Phased in
implementation is scheduled to commence during this financial year, and
will see the strengthening of the current pilot projects in Johannesburg,
Lebowakgomo, Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town. It will also provide for
the expansion of the family court dispensation to other courts.

Once again, we have the private sector to thank for their proactive
participation in this exciting process. However, we need to move beyond
merely bringing justice facilities to women and children. We need to
address issues relating to the cost of litigation, the undue delays and
excessive formalities within the legal process.

With respect to improving access to justice, it is our belief that small
claims courts have a crucial role to play, and this is especially the case
in rural areas. We now have a 142 small claims courts operating throughout
the country, 25 of them designated to rural areas. The establishment of
small claims courts is attributable to the services of the many attorneys
and advocates who serve voluntarily as commissioners, and who are the
driving force behind the process. I would like to take this opportunity to
thank each and every one of them for their support and dedication. I would
also like to thank those private-sector people that assisted the Ministry
and department in determining a strategy for improved service delivery in
the small claims courts over the past year.

It was just last week that I met with department officials and
representatives of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope. We have
agreed, in principle, to a joint venture, pursuant to that society's recent
resolution that each member shall contribute at least three working days to
pro bono work per calendar year. A project to ensure that the pro bono
contribution of the law society members is used to best advantage in our
courts and other cluster structures will be established in the near future.
An initiative to pilot the participation of students as legal assistants in
the small claims courts has also been approved. I must thank the Cape Law
Society and UCT's Law Faculty for their valuable contributions to our
process.

Strategic partnerships like these between ourselves, the private sector,
the legal profession and academic institutions will contribute
significantly to the improvement of our service delivery capacity. We are
grateful to the many individuals, institutions and corporations that have
demonstrated their support through constructive engagement and co-
operation. We should also not forget the many nongovernmental and community-
based organisations that volunteer in our courts. We salute their efforts
and acknowledge their dedication. We know that many of these organisations
suffer severe resource constraints, and that it is for this reason that we
used Government's 16 Days of Activism programme last year to raise funds
for these organisations. We raised nearly R800 000, and the Foundation for
Human Rights contributed as much to a ring-fenced fund dedicated to
supporting organisations that work with victims of violence.

The Minister in his opening address of today's debate contextualised the
work of our department within the range of work performed by our safety and
security cluster. The importance of interdepartmental co-operation and
integrated work processes is perhaps most clearly demonstrated in the
workings of our sexual offences courts. The department, the National
Prosecuting Authority, the Department of Social Development and SAPS have
established a close working relationship, and have developed a national
strategy for the accelerated roll-out of sexual offences courts.

The focus of their effort is to provide a seamless service to our clients
from the time that each case is reported right through to prosecution. To
date, 40 sexual offences courts have been established in designated crisis
areas and four Thuthuzela clinics are currently operational. The co-
operation and assistance of the Health department has been invaluable in
setting up these fine examples of service excellence where the victim is
central to the process. Again, the participation of the private sector in
enhancing our roll-out capacity must be acknowledged at this point.

Our policy with respect to domestic violence is premised on the direct link
between violence and its palpably negative impact on the development of
women and children. The response to domestic violence legislation has been
overwhelming. Women and children are turning to our courts for protection
in increasingly large numbers. As we speak, 2 427 protection orders for
domestic violence cases have been processed by the Wynberg Court alone
since the beginning of the year.

The successful implementation of this important legislation is, once again,
highly dependent on the integrated efforts of the SA Police Services and
the Departments of Justice and Social Development. Recent analysis by the
Consortium on Violence Against Women on the domestic violence legislation
has indicated that where high levels of co-operation exist between the
responsible departments, significantly improved levels of service are
experienced by the client. Ongoing training for officials in our courts and
improved mechanisms for co-ordinating the work of all the role-players will
continue to be the focus of our efforts to improve current service levels
now and in future.

Recent United Nations statistical analysis have revealed that women perform
two thirds of the world's work, earn one tenth of the world's income and
own less than one hundredth of the world's property. Our President, Thabo
Mbeki, has insisted that gender equity is the litmus test for the advance
we are making towards fundamental social transformation. It is for this
reason that we are delighted to announce the designation of 62 courts as
equality courts, all of which came into operation today. We strongly
believe that these courts will serve as important mechanisms for righting
the gender and racial wrongs and imbalances that continue to prevail in our
society. We look forward to an expanded programme of operation over the
coming financial year.

Our programme for judicial and legal reform is well on track. We can be
proud of the fact that many of the rights-based laws passed by this House
since 1994 are widely considered to be best practice examples of
progressive lawmaking. Our challenge, as we go forward, will be to reduce
the gap between ambitious legislative measures and practical delivery on
the ground.

In closing, I wish to thank the Minister, the director-general, his exco
and the Justice Board for their continued support. Thanks must also go to
the officials and my office for their unflagging dedication. Finally, I
would be failing in my duty if I did not recognise the sterling efforts of
the justice portfolio committee and its chairperson. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Speaker, it is undeniable that the levels of crime
remain unacceptably high. Whilst we have to wait until August to obtain the
exact crime figures, most South Africans are clearly overwhelmed and
preoccupied with crime, its effects and how to combat it.

The callousness of the crimes, particularly the rapes and murders, has
resulted in society calling for harsher measures, including the
reintroduction of the death penalty - a call that the ACDP has consistently
supported. Few would disagree that the judgment prohibiting the death
penalty remains one of the most controversial decisions of the
Constitutional Court. It is crucial for the court to be sensitive to public
opinion and to retain public support for the exercise of its power, failing
which it may lose legitimacy as an institution of South African public
life.

According to Judge Dennis Davies, constitutional reviews are conducted by
unelected judges who are in power to overturn the will of a democratically
elected and accountable legislature, in terms of a process of interpreting
abstract constitutional provisions. In short, the question arises as to how
to account for and justify the curtailment of the operation of a democratic
political system in favour of an unaccountable institution?

As far as the pattern in the media is concerned, the ACDP wishes to
reiterate the fact that the independence of the judiciary, being one of the
central pillars of our Constitution and the guardian of the rule of law,
must be protected. We need only to look at Zimbabwe to see what happens to
the rule of law when the independence of the judiciary is not safeguarded.

Having practised as an attorney for 15 years, I am fully mindful of the
tremendous workload faced by members of the judiciary. My concerns, as well
as those of the members of the justice committee, relate to the fact that
the High Courts are only able to sit for an average of three hours and 25
minutes for a variety of reasons, often beyond the control of the presiding
officer. At no time did we, as the ACDP, or for that matter any member of
the justice portfolio committee, allege that judges only work for this
period. Clearly, there is a huge amount of chamber work, and the recesses
are inter alia used for the preparation of judgments and the reading of
appeal records.

We wish to also disassociate ourselves, as the ACDP, from any insinuation
that anyone said that judges are lazy and overpaid. My understanding of the
discussions was that a number of issues were raised to address the backlogs
of the court and the need to increase court hours per day for all courts,
including the High Courts.

We as MPs and parliamentarians do, however, need to continue to monitor the
courts and address issues contributing to increasing court backlogs. A
particular concern, one that I raised in the committee, is the application
of the minimum sentencing legislation by certain High Courts. I am
particularly concerned with the practice that rape victims are being
subjected to unnecessary further victimisation by not only having to give
evidence in the regional court, but when the matter is referred to the High
Court for sentencing, being recalled to give evidence a second time. This
further victimisation is unacceptable and must be brought to an end. A
solution to this problem would be to institute all such prosecutions, where
there may be the imposition of a minimum sentence, in the High Court to
avoid such secondary victimisation.

As far as the National Prosecuting Authority is concerned, the statistics
indicate an increase from 756 000 last year to almost a million cases,
which is a substantial increase. To assist the National Prosecuting
Authority with their task of fighting crime, the following should be
speedily considered: Firstly, as requested by the National Director of
Public Prosecutions, the asset forfeiture legislation needs to be urgently
beefed up. How is it possible that a fugitives from justice can contest
asset forfeiture proceedings aimed at combating organised crime without
subjecting themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts?

Secondly, last year I endorsed the call for legislative amendments to
compel accused persons to divulge their defence in view of the obligation
of the state to provide a copy of the police docket. This, together with
plea bargaining and special initiatives such as Saturday courts, will go a
long way to expedite the finalisation of cases.

In the last few seconds available to me, I want to raise the very serious
issue relating to the department's deposit account. It is disgraceful that
corrupt officials are robbing the public by pocketing what could be
millions of rands deposited for maintenance payments, bail money, fines and
deceased estates.

The fact that accounts of many of the approximately 750 courts are in a
state of chaos and that the amount of money that has been misappropriated
is, according to the Chief Financial Officer, significant, is an issue of
great concern. The state will in all likelihood be held liable to make good
the losses that may run into many millions of rands. [Applause.]

Mr J T MASEKA: Madam Speaker, the UDM supports the hon Minister for Justice
and Constitutional Development and the chairperson of the portfolio
committee in recognising the constitutional independence of the judiciary.
Furthermore, the UDM noted how these two persons reacted to various
newspaper reports. The UDM commends the Chief Justice's reports regarding
his participation in the public hearing of the department's budget.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is to play an
important role in that it is to uphold and protect the Constitution and the
rule of law. The department has to make sure that justice is being done and
is seen to be done.

Accessibility, fairness and speedy and cost effective administration of
justice are some of the most important requirements that the Department of
Justice and Constitutional Development should prioritise. To achieve these
priorities the department has to have proper administration, efficient
court services, state legal services, a national prosecuting authority and
auxiliary associated services like the Scorpions, the Asset Forfeiture Unit
and the Special Investigating Unit.

This Budget should be used to meet these priorities. It is disgusting to
learn, at the end of the financial year, that an amount of money has been
returned to the National Treasury as unused by the department, yet there
are priorities that were not attended to.

The budget of this department is increased each year, but services rendered
by it leaves much to be desired. Corruption, inefficiency and staff
shortages are some of the main contributory factors to the poor service
delivery in the department, and it is not doing enough to deal with these
factors decisively. Taxpayers' money are being used for purposes that are
benefiting some individuals rather than the public.

This budget should be used effectively and efficiently to meet the
requirements of this department by building the necessary buildings and
structures that can be accessed by all. It must further employ and train
enough staff that can render efficient and proper services to the public.
Justice should be accessible to all, particularly in the previously
disadvantaged areas.

Court buildings should be built where they are needed the most, like in the
rural areas where there are no courts, and people have to travel long
distances to access justice. In some instances cases are unnecessarily
withdrawn as witnesses cannot reach courts because they are far, and they
have no money to travel there.

It is also important that the issue of a witness fee should be looked into
because of this unnecessary travelling. Cases are postponed and
unnecessarily withdrawn after people have travelled long distances to
various courts. This department is urged to act immediately to see to it
that this type of exercises are addressed in a proper manner.

The UDM supports the budget.

Mr G B MANGWANISHE: Madam Speaker, hon members, there is no better way of
honouring the 1976 generation of young people than the way in which we are
doing today, namely reporting on the progress that we have made during the
last 12 months in bettering the lives of our people, and presenting an
action plan for the future and a plan on how we are going to finance it.
Like them, we remain committed to creating a society where there will be no
blacks, whites, coloureds or Indians, just proud South Africans.

It is on days like these, when we pass laws and budgets, that people of
this country are able to say: We might be poor today, we might not have
something to eat, but we remain convinced that the future is bright.
Because we committed ourselves that, together with the ANC-led Government,
we shall be agents of change, we shall be agents of change by bringing
change into our own lives.

We made this commitment, knowing very well that this was not going to be an
easy road. We refuse that people, who do not have our interest at heart,
take advantage of our poverty by feeding us with negative thoughts,
thoughts that suggest that we are failing as a nation, because they want
our vote. The ANC came to the people of South Africa in 1999 and asked for
a partnership to address the country's problems. It did not tell the people
of South Africa to fight back. It did not tell the people of South Africa
to fight the poor, the vulnerable women and children. It asked the people
of South Africa to be their own liberators. The result of this partnership
is clear to all those who want to see.

I know that there are those who will decide not to see and not to hear.
Because seeing good things and hearing good news is very painful to them.
However, it is important for the nation to hear this good news. When the
Legal Aid Board decided to move away from the judicare system and to
provide legal assistance through salaried lawyers, it has been able to
reduce the average cost per finalised matter from R1 404 to R699; thereby
making allowance for more people to be helped.

At present 68% of all district and regional courts are covered by the local
justice centres. Within this financial year, the Legal Aid Board will be
able to link each justice centre to all district, regional and High Courts
in its area of operations. Within this financial year, each justice centre
will link with every prison in its area of operation. It will establish a
system of consultation with awaiting-trial and sentenced prisoners.

A pilot project is underway to look at co-operation with advice offices to
increase the link with communities. We are convinced that the Legal Aid
Board is equal to the challenges facing them, namely, that of contributing
and making the justice system work and of providing quality legal services
to the poor.

Let me welcome and thank Judge Dunstan Mlambo, who is the new Chairperson
of the Legal Aid Board, and the CEO, Ms Vidhu, Vedalankar, her management
team and the staff of the Legal Aid Board for doing such good work. I would
also like to thank the previous chairperson, Judge Navsa, and the previous
CEO, Mr Ally, for a job well done. We also urge public bodies, especially
departments, to comply with section 32 of the Access to Information Act, by
submitting reports to the Human Rights Commission. It is only through such
compliance that you will be able to see the impact of this legislation.

Despite the challenges we face in creating a better life for all we know
that, in the end, the sun shall rise, despite destructive criticism from
those who do not believe in the transformation of our country. But we are
certain that the sun shall rise. I thank you.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, I take part in this debate on
behalf of my new leader, the President of the PAC, Dr Motsoko Pheko, whom
we congratulate and wish every success in his term of office. [Applause.]
The PAC supports the budget on Justice and Constitutional Development. In
the limited time at my disposal, however, I want to raise a few issues in
the context of international law, which our Constitution claims to
recognise.
According to the TRC there are only 22 000 victims of apartheid who will
receive reparations. Is this logical out of a population of 40 million
people who suffered the bestiality of apartheid in various ways and forms?
According to President Thabo Mbeki only R30 000 will be paid as reparations
to each of the victims of apartheid. This is about 2 500 British pounds. It
is peanuts, well contrasted to the billions of dollars which were paid to
the Jews after the Second World War, and to others in Japan, Korea, New
Zealand, etc.

President Mbeki has also declared that freedom fighters who did not appear
before the TRC for their armed anti-apartheid activities will be
prosecuted. This raised the most disturbing question in international law.
Does a crime against humanity apply to Africans? This does not seem to be
the case in the context of the naked disregard of the International
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid,
through which the United Nations declared apartheid a crime against
humanity. Prosecuting the former freedom fighters will destabilise this
country and open old wounds. The TRC has been based on the wrong legal
premise. It is a fraud. If there is prosecution of former freedom fighters,
the TRC will be more discredited.

Other matters which must be looked into are motor vehicle allowances for
magistrates, their salaries and their conditions of service. There have
been complaints about these matters for a long time. In a country where
there is so much crime, this nation needs a well-equipped and satisfied
magistracy. The department must respond positively to the needs of the
magistrates. Some magistrates are relief magistrates. They need reliable
transport and convenient accommodation. They often have to argue or wait
for reimbursement for travel and accommodation. This does not do their
morale any good. As late as 26 February 2003, the secretary of the
Magistrates Commission in Pretoria was reminded about this matter on behalf
of the subcluster heads or senior magistrates and head office.

The PAC is concerned about the extreme delay in paying the R888 000 which
was recommended by the TRC for the 22 000 victims of apartheid, and hopes
that this delay can be explained convincingly. Some victims have been
desperate for their money, while others have died.

There has been a newspaper report that a Kenyan woman, Mrs Wanjiku
Kamendere, awaited trial for 21 years. This is scandalous. This perversion
of justice must be investigated. It does not present a good image of the
justice system of any country. We trust that the recent rift between the
judges and the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development will be
resolved. We have a wonderful judicial system, and our judges and
magistrates are important pillars of our democratic dispensation. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, it is sad to note the tension between our
independent judiciary and Parliament, as we debate this vote. The MF
sincerely hopes that matters will be settled and unison maintained in the
best interests of South Africa. The Constitution governs supreme. An act in
contravention to it is illegal. The independence of our three spheres are
clear-cut in our Constitution. This independence, the MF feels, should be
upheld at all costs. We cannot allow such childish tramping on toes and
pointing of fingers. There are far more serious issues that our justice
system needs to address. Here I want to compliment the chairperson of the
portfolio committee on the action taken by him.

Change in our system has been gradual, and more speedy transformation would
be greatly appreciated, but the MF does note the seriousness and the need
for caution in transforming this sector. In consideration of this, the MF
feels that patience needs to be adopted to ensure that efficient policies
are put into place to manage our justice system correctly. The MF notes the
many efforts and accomplishments of the department in its service to our
people. However, the media often manages to paint a weak picture of our
justice system.

The MF feels that leniency, in terms of crime, has to be graded. Our people
need to be reassured that their safety and wellbeing is a priority, and
that we are working hard at securing that. The MF also notes that our
prisons are overcrowded, but feels that community threats need to be
sentenced to do time, in the hope of rehabilitation, prevention and in
order to instil confidence in our justice system.

Though the MF feels that the independence of our spheres are necessary for
our democracy, a close working relationship between the three is important
to ensure a system of checks and balances. The MF hopes that the budget
allocated to the department for this financial year shall assist in the
issues that it is facing. The MF supports budget vote 24. Thank you, Madam
Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr G SOLOMON: Madam Speaker, with due respect to Dr Delport as a senior
politician, I am somewhat baffled by the political discourse of the hon
member regarding the justice system in the new South Africa. If he and his
party are yearning for the certainties of the past, where the legal system
was the main cog in the machinery of domination sustaining a privileged
class, then it is completely out of context today.

The new democratic South Africa has a human rights based legal system,
underpinned by a constitution and a Constitutional Court. Besides this, it
is imperative that the justice system must be seen today in the realm of
the economic and social realities in South Africa, including the stark
poverty of many South Africans and the gross income and wealth disparities
between black and white. Planning and re-engineering, in such a context,
might face unexpected and unprecedented challenges - which we are
experiencing. If we hope to transform, however, we must accept that the
playing field must be levelled. There is no other way.

Nevertheless, one of the most serious challenges facing this Government
was, and still is, the successful transformation of the justice system, and
particularly the criminal justice system. In order to take up this
challenge, eight business units have been identified under the Minister for
Justice and Constitutional Development and headed by the director-general.
The most important of these units is the Business Unit: Court Services. The
management of courts is also the core function of the department.

The tasks of this unit, briefly, are the following: the provision of court
buildings, and equipping those buildings with the necessary resources and
infrastructure; and most importantly, to manage these in order to
facilitate, as speedily and cost-effectively as possible, the adjudication
of criminal matters and the resolution of civil disputes reaching the court
rolls. This applies to the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of
Appeal, the High Courts, specialised courts and the lower courts. In order
to execute its task, the business unit is presently implementing what they
call a major paradigm shift. What this means is that things will be done
differently than before, and if properly executed, will yield better
results.

The difference really is that the work will shift, as the Minister has
indicated, from the centralised regional offices to court service centres
at the courts, thereby implementing an integrated court management system
at the point of action. It is at this point where the collective effort of
the Cabinet cluster, safety and security converges. It is at this point
where, depending upon the co-operation and the quality of the input of the
various stakeholders of the cluster, we can realise the rights of an
indigent mother to obtain maintenance for her children in a decent and
dignified way and so preventing further breakdown in the social fabric
which might lead to an escalation in violence and criminality.

It is at this point also where children, who unfortunately came into
confrontation with the criminal justice system for committing various
serious crimes, but at times for very petty dishonesty crimes, could have a
speedy justice process. This would mean that he or she will not languish in
jail as an awaiting-trial prisoner for weeks, months or even years, wasting
away the potentially productive years of youth, or be denied an opportunity
for education or productive work; or worse still, be exposed to abuse by
hardened criminals and sucked up into the evil network of prison gangs.

It is also at this point where the department has the opportunity to
unravel the overburdened court rolls and significantly improve the ratio
between court hours and the completion of trials. It is quite clear that
the success of this strategic plan of the Business Unit: Court Services is
critically underpinned by the collaborative efforts of the key stakeholders
of the cabinet cluster, safety and security.

In rolling out the strategic court management plan, the unit recognises
that the people whom it serves, are the most important component.
Therefore, physical accessibility to user-friendly courts is one of the key
considerations. To give effect to this, a very complex and technical
process is still under way in order to redefine jurisdictional boundaries
which were complicated by apartheid, homelands and bantustan policies.

The principle of this operation is that all Government departments must
align their service delivery boundaries, where possible, to the political
boundaries, namely, provincial and municipal boundaries. It simply means
that each province should be served by a High Court and that the service
delivery of the SA Police Service must align with the magisterial districts
proposed by the Department for Justice and Constitutional Development.
Again we require the co-operative effort of provincial and local government
affairs, the SA Police Service and Justice.

To come back to the activities of the business unit, the non-negotiable
golden thread that runs through all the planning of the activities of this
unit, is to level the playing field between services supplied to previously
advantaged and privileged areas and communities, and the appalling
condition of, and lack of services for the marginalised and underprivileged
areas and communities, particularly women, children and the rural poor.

In 1999, the hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development
visited various areas and investigated matters relating to court
availability and efficiency. He found that the court building, for example,
at Tembisa could not accommodate the provision for maintenance service.
Indigent women had to travel a long distance to queue at the Kempton Park
court. He reported it to this House in September 1999. An interim, quick-
fix solution was immediately effected with the collaboration of Business
Against Crime, and the construction of a new building was programmed for
2003.

At the justice committee budget vote hearings on the 8 June 2003, the head
of the Business Unit Court Services reported that the new court in Tembisa
was nearing completion - a promise kept to the people of Tembisa with on-
target delivery. In the same report to this House, the hon Minister
announced the concept of the model court project in order to establish
minimum standards of customer care in a holistic way, dealing with family
matters, sexual offences and child friendly accommodation. Mitchells Plain
in the Western Cape was targeted. In April 2003, I attended the opening
ceremony of the model court in Mitchells Plain. A promise to the people of
Mitchells Plain was honoured with on-target delivery.

Also in the same report to this House, the hon Minister announced the
laying of the foundation of a new court in Khayelitsha, and he spoke about
it, in order to bring justice in a holistic way to the doorstep of the
people of this township. In May 2003, the new, impressive, well-equipped
court was officially opened by President Thabo Mbeki - a promise to the
people of Khayelitsha honoured with on-target delivery.

And just by the way, on Thursday we are also opening a court in Bluedowns -
another promise kept to the mainly coloured population of that community.
[Applause.] We are not saying that everything is running smoothly with the
plans and programmes of this unit. There are still many challenges. We are
coming to grips with outdated accounting procedures. We are doing our best,
and I think we are succeeding in correcting the books which must be
balanced. We are also dealing, as we have heard here, with the sensitive
issue of the question of the number of court hours worked by judicial
officers from the High Courts to the lower courts. Unfortunately, important
feathers sometimes get ruffled in the process.

However, what we do know after two weeks of public hearings with the
department, is that we have a department with a vision, policies, and plans
to tackle its challenges. We have a DG who is dedicated, and under whom we
have business unit managers who are dependable and as dedicated. We have a
no-nonsense portfolio committee, and we shall execute our functions with
all the power that the law allows. We have not overstepped, shall not
overstep and have no intention of overstepping the principle of the
independence of the judiciary. But we shall insist, persist and pursue our
function of overseeing without fear of failure in order to improve the
justice system in our country. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Mevrou die Speaker, die huidige storm tussen die ses
regters, presidente en die agb Johnny de Lange is tans voorbladnuus. Dit is
nie die eerste keer dat die integriteit en onafhanklikheid van ons regbank
in die gedrang kom nie.

Ek ken die argument: Die regbank is onafhanklik, maar nie onaantasbaar nie.
Ek weet, die blote feit van regterskap verander 'n mens nie in 'n
onfeilbare, onaantasbare wese nie. Ek weet dat die verweer gemaak kan word
dat regters professioneel onafhanklik is. Die onafhanklikheid van die
regbank het betrekking op die regspraak wat hulle uitoefen, maar
administratief staan hulle onder toesig en gesag.

Ek weet die agb Johnny de Lange is 'n baie hardwerkende en bekwame
voorsitter, maar uitlatings soos dié wat hy geuiter het, hoort nie in die
openbaar nie. Dít is waar die probleem kom. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Madam Speaker, the current storm between the six judges-
president and the hon Johnny de Lange is front-page news at present. This
is not the first time that the integrity and independence of our judiciary
are being prejudiced.

I know the argument: The judiciary is independent, but not unassailable. I
know, the mere fact that one is a judge does not change one into an
infallible, unassailable being. I know the argument can be made that judges
are professionally independent. The independence of the judiciary relates
to the administration of justice exercised by them, but administratively
they are subject to supervision and authority.

I know that the hon Johnny de Lange is a very hard-working and competent
chairman, but statements such as those made by him do not belong in the
public arena. That is where the problem arises.]

The distinction the hon De Lange made today again between the
administrative and judicial functions of judges may be valid, but this
distinction does not mean that it is wise to, by implication, throw a
shadow over the integrity of judges when it comes to administrative
matters, and then expect the public to have confidence in the same judges
when performing their judicial functions.

Dit ondermyn hul aansien en vertroue; dis soos om die skoolhoof voor die
kinders uit te trap. [This undermines the esteem in which they are held and
their confidence; it can be likened to chastising the school principal in
front of the children.]

And in his attempt to apply damage control today, the hon De Lange actually
added insult to injury and even made more attacks on the judiciary. It is
not a matter of, as the hon Koos Van der Merwe said: ``Hy het geplace,
gedrop en gescore''. It is rather a matter of playing off-sides and we must
consider a red card. [Interjections.]

Ja, ek het nie tyd daarvoor nie. Om agter die hoofregterposisie weg te
kruip, verander niks aan die saak nie. Die gesag van die hoofregter ontneem
nie die regters-president hul vryheid van spraak en verdoem hul nie tot die
status van zombies nie.

Agb Speaker, is dit nie maar 'n geval daarvan dat die ANC in sy totalitêre
heerskappy dit nie kan verdra dat daar 'n duimbreedte van die SA samelewing
is wat nie onder sy plak staan nie?

En dan maak die agb De Lange nog die fout om regters se produktiwiteit
bloot te meet aan die ure wat hulle op die bank deurbring. Dan moet hy
seker 'n ernstige probleem hê met predikante, want volgens dié redenasie,
werk hulle net twee ure per week. Soos hulle sê: ``Ses dae van die week
onsigbaar en die sewende dag onverstaanbaar.''

Asof dit nie genoeg is nie, volg die agb De Lange dit op met 'n versugting
dat streeklanddroste 'n horlosie-oudit moet ondergaan om te kyk of hulle
nie dalk aspris laat slap lê in die week net om 'n verskoning te hê vir
Saterdag se oortydbetaling nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs
follows.)

[Yes, I have no time for that. To hide behind the position of chief justice
does not change anything. The authority of the chief justice does not
deprive the judges-president of their freedom of speech or condemn them to
the status of zombies.

Hon Speaker, is it not simply a case in of the ANC in its totalitarian rule
not being able to bear the thought of there being an inch of South African
society which is not under its whip.

And then the hon De Lange still makes the mistake of measuring judges'
productivity solely on the basis of the number of hours that they spend on
the bench. Then he probably must have a serious problem with the clergy
because, according to this argument, they work for only two hours per week.
As they say: ``Invisible for six days of the week and unintelligible on the
seventh.''

As if that were not enough, the hon De Lange follows it up with a
suggestion that regional magistrates should be subjected to a time-and-
motion audit to see whether they are not perhaps dragging their feet on
purpose during the week just to have an excuse for Saturday's overtime
pay.]

Speaker, the NA is in general satisfied with the way in which the
conclusion of the TRC process was handled. It could have been a process of
guilt and blame casting over and over again.

And I want to say to the Reverend Mogoba: R30 000 is R30 000 more than the
victims received after the Anglo Boer War. It is, however, still not clear
how exactly the Public Prosecutor fits in the whole picture. What exactly
is the procedure? Is this door also open for persons currently in jail
because of political offences for which they did not get amnesty from the
TRC? We want to have clarity on that.

Laastens, die feit dat bykans een derde van die 70% aangehoudenes in ons
oorvol tronke verhoorafwagtend is, werp 'n skadu op die effektiwiteit van
die departement. Talle oplossings is al aan die hand gedoen. Sporadiese en
gefragmenteerde pogings soos Saterdaghowe alleen gaan nie die probleem
oplos nie. Die NA stel 'n totale herbesinning voor, 'n bymekaarkom van alle
betrokkenes, ook uit die regsprofessie, om nuut en oorspronklik hieroor te
besin. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Lastly, the fact that almost one third of the 70% of prisoners in our
overpopulated prisons are awaiting trial casts a shadow on the
effectiveness of the department. Numerous solutions have been suggested.
Sporadic and fragmented efforts such as Saturday courts alone are not going
to solve the problem. The NA proposes a total reconsideration, a meeting of
all those involved, also from the legal profession, to think about this in
a new and original way.]

The practice of plea bargaining is a step in the right direction. Maybe the
hon Minister could tell this House more or less to what extent it was used,
and what can be done to maximise this practice and to minimise unnecessary
long cases, from which only the law practitioners score. We cannot afford
it, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Waar wil jy 'n ernstiger vorm van menseregteskending hê as dat 'n man vier
jaar lank aangehou is en dan vrygelaat word. Ek suig dit nie uit my duim
uit nie. Hy was in my kantoor. Ek dank u. [Where would you find a more
serious form of human rights violation than a man being held in custody for
four years and then being released. I am not sucking this out of my thumb.
He was in my office. I thank you.]

Ms T E MILLEIN: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, the IAM regrets the
unseemly state of affairs currently pertaining in the controversial matter
involving the three arms of state, namely the executive, Parliament and the
judiciary.

Surely it is imperative that the general public does not lose respect,
particularly for our executive and the judiciary. Moreover, in terms of the
Constitutional provisions and the separation of powers, there are clear
divisions between these institutions and each must avoid encroaching on the
others' territory. The onus on us as politicians and MPs not to breach the
powers of the judiciary is probably even more essential, given the well-
established tendency of politicians - and I include myself - who find it
irresistible to engage in matters controversial.

Perhaps, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is one occasion when our obsession with
openness and transparency should be tempered with quiet diplomacy and
discretion in resolving issues where these three institutions of state are
so patently at odds with one another. It is neither desirable nor necessary
- in my opinion - for the unedifying spectacle of mud-slinging between our
highest organs of state, the end result of which can only lead to the
undermining of one, or all parties involved.

Unless we wish to emulate the atrocious precedents being perpetrated by our
northern neighbour, Zimbabwe, whose leader has single-handedly perverted
the rule of law and justice in that country to the extent that there is no
law or justice, we must simply resolve this national crisis of confidence
in and between the executive, Parliament and the judiciary expeditiously
and amicably. We will thereby restore the honour, dignity and respect
essential to sustaining good governance.

I support, in general, the hon Minister's call for a review of the criminal
justice system, with the goal of dealing more effectively dealing with
violent crime. I thank you.

Ms L L MABE: Deputy Speaker, I want to start by saying that it is the
strong-hearted who are determined to turn the wheel around and face the
challenges created by apartheid in this country with much zeal and
creativity. In the course of doing that they will be transforming our
society so that it will be the society that the Freedom Charter envisaged
for the future.

I want to say that those who think that we will go back to the situation
prior to 1994 are wrong. I want to challenge them to work hard to ensure
that they get the ANC out of Government because the ANC is the Parliament
of the people of South Africa.

It is a big challenge to change the state machinery that was inherited from
apartheid. It's not child's play and it's not those who are prophesying
that they will do better than what the ANC is doing who can do what we have
achieved so far.

I want to say that it is through the ANC that we have created the National
Prosecuting Authority that we have right now. It was a big challenge for
us, as the ANC, that continuing with what we found in the previous
government would be a disaster to our society. Indeed we are happy and even
the South African population is happy with what the National Prosecuting
Authority is doing. It will take us even further into the next century to
show that the ANC can do it. Nobody but the ANC can do it. [Applause.]

I want to say that the National Prosecuting Authority is five years old. An
ordinary person on the street will tell you, with a smile, what the Asset
Forfeiture Unit is doing and what the Scorpions are doing. Meet any South
African, they will tell you what the Scorpions are doing. They will even go
to the extent that when they see that something wrong is happening, they
would wish that if they had the power, they would immediately call the
Scorpions to come and address that problem. That is what the ANC has
created. [Applause.]

I want to give an example of what happened in Hout Bay [Interjections] I'm
not interested in whatever you want to say. I want to give an example of
what the National Prosecuting Authority, in conjunction with other
departments, has done in Hout Bay, where they have ensured that this
problem of abalone poaching on our shores must come to an end. This thing
was happening long before the ANC came into Government. What we did was to
ensure that we tackle it head-on, and for your information, the National
Prosecuting Authority has even seized the boats that were used by the
criminals to run away from the police. That is an achievement. [Applause.]

The other thing that we have done is to challenge corruption head-on. That
is what this agency is doing. They are even probing into different
departments, including the agency itself. I am sure that members have read
in the papers about what happened recently, namely, that 35 officials of
the National Prosecuting Authority were suspended for corruption. It shows
how we as this Government are committed to eradicating corruption.
[Interjections.]

It is the aim and the objective of the ANC to take the profit of crime away
from the criminals so that they know that whatever they have gained through
crime will not be theirs forever, but will be theirs for few days, until
the Scorpions come to them and deal with them like a dog dealing with a
bone. [Laughter.]

I also want to say that I sometimes get happy when I am in my constituency.
I come from a platinum city in the North West province where people would
come to us as MPs and ask us how to get hold of the Scorpions because they
are aware that at such-and-such a house there's something wrong happening,
or something wrong is happening to our platinum. If an ordinary person can
come to you confidently, knowing that there are people employed by this
Government who can challenge the criminals, it makes us happy as the ANC.

However, I also want to say that I'm happy with the efforts of the National
Prosecuting Authority to get to the police stations every Sunday, so that
they can screen the dockets to ensure that all the dockets that are brought
to court are dockets that can stand the test of the court.

You must remember that most of the complaints that go to these police
stations over the weekend are, for example, about people who were arrested
because a particular shebeen was raided and people were drinking beer
there. They didn't do anything wrong. They were just drinking beer and they
happened to be taken along to the police station. So those complaints are
recorded as part of the cases that are on the roll, and they are a waste of
time.

Some people, for instance, would even report you for making a noise when
you are having a night vigil. It is unfortunate but we as Africans conduct
night vigils. If we make a noise that disturbs you, it's unfortunate, but
the police should not record it as a crime incident. [Interjections.]

I also want to say I'm positive that the case of the Boeremag will be dealt
with effectively and that the National Prosecuting Authority will ensure
that, when that case is decided by the court, the court will have all the
relevant information. People who are against this Government and think that
we should go back to prior to 1994, and who think that a black person
cannot govern a country like South Africa, should stop thinking like that.
They should accept that they are part of South Africa and they will remain
part of South Africa, unless they are not committed to becoming South
Africans.

Finally I want to challenge the youth on the fact that we need your talent.
As the youth, go back to school. Study the relevant courses. Yesterday I
attended a funeral of a young woman who was a crime analyst. Somebody must
replace that particular woman because she was doing a lot of good work in
the Potchefstroom area. So I'm challenging the youth: Take up your books,
study hard and ensure that, because this Government wants you and your
contribution, you contribute to a better South Africa and Africa. I want to
thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Madam Deputy Speaker, in the run-up to this Budget Vote
debate it has become clear that the Department of Justice is a department
in trouble. Not only are the leaders of our justice system, our top judges,
apparently at loggerheads with the ANC and the Government - and I have
heard nothing today to indicate anything to the contrary - but the
Scorpions, the elite crime-busting jewel in the platinum crown of the
National Prosecuting Authority, last week arrested 35 of their own members
for alleged fraud. In a department with a staff complement of some 11 000
there are at present 2 000 disciplinary investigations of mismanagement
pending, nearly 300 disciplinary cases under way and 95 suspensions
current.

While the scams and misconduct paint an unhappy picture, the latest spat in
a seemingly deteriorating relationship between the ANC politicians and High
Court judges is of deep concern. The judges' perception of an insinuation
that they are paid too much for too little work coming after claims of a
lack of transformation of the bench from the same quarter is clearly the
last straw. The protest meeting held by six of the nine judges president is
unprecedented. It is also noteworthy that five of those six judges are
black, and also the spokesperson on their behalf is black. [Interjections.]

The DA calls on the Minister of Justice to reassure the judges that the ANC
will not pursue actions to lower the esteem with which they are regarded by
the general public, thereby undermining their credibility, dignity,
integrity and, indirectly, their independence. While measured critical
comment may sometimes be appropriate, it is clear that judges believe that
the fine line demarcating the separation of powers between the executive,
legislature and judiciary has been overstepped. The DA believes that it is
the duty of all of us, in terms of the Constitution, to protect and ensure
the independence and dignity of the bench.

In relation to the ANC's recent complaints about the judges, the following
should be noted in connection with transformation. In 1994 there were three
black judges and one woman judge. Since then there has been a quantum leap
and we now have 72 black judges and, not as good a result, 23 women out of
a total of 214. The Chief Justice told the portfolio committee last week
that transformation is proceeding as quickly as it can in view of the
shallow pool of suitable black and women lawyers as candidates for
appointment, and that judges' salaries are too low to attract the brightest
and best black lawyers.

Productivity of the high courts is a concern, but as Chief Justice
Chaskalson also indicated last week, the causes of this are varied and
complex, including delays by other role-players such as the Legal Aid
Board, correctional services, SAPS and the failure of the justice
department to provide sufficient interpreters and security personnel.
The Chief Justice had some harsh words about the state of criminal justice
in this country when he briefed the portfolio committee. He said that 50%
of crimes in our country go unpunished because of poor policing and
prosecution. He said, and I quote:


  It is intolerable that the awaiting-trial period is as long as it is.

He condemned the low productivity of the courts in general and stated:


  I believe the lack of capacity in the courts needs to be acknowledged. If
  the capacity is not there the problem cannot be solved.

And he indicated that it may well be a matter of an inadequate budget.

The DA agrees wholeheartedly with the Chief Justice. He also said:


  Enough time has passed for the changes in our society to be digested.

There is some good news in this budget. So that the DA will not be accused
of being negative only, we will highlight some of it. In the first place,
the effective increase of some R747 million is the largest ever increase
since 1994 and the first time that we have kept up with the inflation rate.
But if one considers the enormous backlog in resourcing that has built up
over the years it is more or less reflected in the huge backlogs in the
court rolls referred to by the Minister himself, and it is not remotely
enough.

The consolidation of the financial management process during the past two
years, through the advent of Mr Alan McKenzie and the intervention of
Business Against Crime, has made a difference to improve budgeting, better
financial control systems and the uncovering of fraud and scams. However,
the Auditor-General told Scopa today that the culture of noncompliance with
these precepts was still rife in the department and had not yet been
addressed.
The other good news, which has been mentioned already in the debate, is
that 55 maintenance investigators have at last been appointed on 1 April
2003 for the maintenance courts - five years late, it must be conceded. The
maintenance courts around the country are still in a shambles, as all the
experts have said and as we have seen ourselves. They are overburdened,
inadequately staffed, inefficiently run, with thousands of fathers escaping
their obligation to pay. So the jury is still out on the effectiveness of
this Act.

However, even taking into account the positive developments, the justice
department is just not coping with the burdens placed on it and that makes
it impossible for the DA to support this Budget Vote. How can the DA
support the Vote when ordinary members of the public experience the courts
as painfully slow, inefficient and unfriendly to their needs? The plight of
victims is not being addressed. [Interjections.] The recent withdrawal of
cases because of poor performance by state prosecutors is no comfort to the
victims of those crimes.
The National Director of the National Prosecuting Authority claims that his
goal is a victim-centred criminal justice system, and yet, after two years
of mulling it over, no victims' charter has yet emerged from the Department
of Justice and Constitutional Development. Promises to set up a victims'
fund, which the DA has called for for years, have been made but no steps
have been taken. The Criminal Assets Recovery Account, which already holds
R27 million in assets forfeited to the state and which is meant to assist
victims of crime and aid the fight against crime, has not yet paid out a
single cent.

If I may, I just want to briefly unpack a few of the problems which make it
impossible for the DA to support the Vote: These are the low productivity
of the courts; the long awaiting-trial periods resulting from the slow pace
of cases through the courts, which has been referred to by other speakers;
persistently low conviction rates in relation to the rising crime rate -
which has also been referred to; and extreme shortages of personnel.
The director-general's own office issued a document that was submitted to
our committee during the hearings which said that the department is both
underresourced and relatively unskilled and, therefore, ill-prepared to
fulfil its mandate. The DA sees insufficient progress in this budget
towards the goals of an efficient, victim-friendly court system and
therefore we cannot support this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mr T E VEZI: Madam Speaker, between 1999 and 2006 the justice budget will
have doubled from R2,6 billion to R5,2 billion. This massive increase
reflects, on the one hand, Government's commitment to bringing justice to
the people and, on the other hand, also indicates the state of our society
at this point in history.

I want to highlight just two additional budget-related figures. Firstly,
expenditure on our law courts will increase by R350 million in the current
financial year. We welcome this increase, as it is well-known that these
courts deal with the vast majority of the criminal and civil cases.
Secondly, the allocation to the Master of the High Court subprogramme
increases from R7,4 million to over R119 m to reflect additional funding
for capacity and infrastructure improvement. This increase is welcomed as
it also reflects the need to implement recent legislative changes to the
Master's offices.

Madam Speaker, in turning to the more general policy matters, the justice
department is responsible for drafting amendments to our Constitution and
for piloting them through Parliament. In dealing with the floor-crossing
legislation the department showed remarkable speed in this regard, yet
Constitutional amendments dealing with the powers and functions of
traditional leaders, and their relation to local government, have not seen
the light seven years after the adoption of the new Constitution.

One has to applaud the department and the Minister for the pilot project in
Port Elizabeth where a multiservice task team consisting of the police,
prosecutors and correctional service staff have already achieved measurable
success. The IFP wants to call on the Minister to urgently find more
resources from within the security cluster that can be used in dealing with
the problems of our court system. Clearly, new innovations are needed in
this regard. We also want to applaud the role played by the business
community, through the instance of the Business Against Crime programme.
Now is the time for all role-players to join hands and make the system
work.

The work done by the Legal Aid Board is vital in terms of the rights
provided by our Constitution. The board is doing good work. But there has
been a fair amount of criticism to the effect that board-appointed public
defenders rarely properly consult with their clients. In many cases, this
will impact negatively on the plea bargaining process. In many cases, the
accused see their defenders in court for the first time. We have also been
informed that language barriers are often responsible for further problems,
especially when indigenous languages are the only means of communication.
The department therefore has to address the number and quality of
interpreters as a matter of urgency.
The IFP also wants to call on the Minister to urgently consult with his
education and social development colleagues regarding places of safety for
young offenders. In many instances, young awaiting-trial offenders are
placed in prisons because there are no places of safety available. For
instance, there are no such facilities in the entire Eastern Cape province,
which obviously means that young offenders end up in prison which has its
own potentially negative effect on their future, rehabilitation and
integration into society.

A serious problem in the so-called conveyor belt of justice is the fact
that cases are often remanded because the case dockets are either
incomplete or inadequate to continue with prosecution. This causes major
difficulties for the prosecution services and leads to the long delays in
the entire criminal justice process. Such delays have a snowball effect
which affects all subsequently required processes. In this regard, we want
to call on the Minister and department to foster greater co-operation with
investigating officers and senior police officers to ensure that these
dockets are delivered on time, in such a state that they can actually be
used in the court process.

Over the past number of years, large amounts of money have been spent on
improving security at our courts, yet there are still problems. In Durban a
murder took place, in Hermanus a magistrate was threatened with death, and
in Port Elizabeth the magistrates' court building has no safes, meaning
that prosecutors have to take home these files, which obviously presents a
great security risk. In Cape Town a court official's car was hijacked with
a number of case files and other documents inside it. The IFP supports the
Vote. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Mr M J MALAHLELA: Deputy Speaker, Chapter 9 of Act 108 of 1996, as amended,
herein referred to as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,
provides for the establishment of state institutions whose role is nothing
else but to strengthen our constitutional democracy - for this
constitutional democracy that we fought so hard, and yet so dearly, to
achieve. In doing this we are reaffirming the pronouncements of the
Congress of the People in Kliptown: That the people shall govern, all shall
be equal before the law and that all shall enjoy equal human rights. This,
in essence, is ample proof that we, the African National Congress of
yesterday, today and tommorrow, are the architects of our own
constitutional democracy.

Yet we are told that the answer to the consolidation of our democracy does
not lie in the strengthening of the Chapter 9 institutions, which have a
responsibility to strengthen constitutional democracy. The answer, it is
said, lies in the creation of a strong opposition to the movement of our
people, the movement whose clarion call is a united action to push back the
frontiers of our poverty. And we ask: What is there to be opposed? Who and
on whose behalf do you oppose?

The Human Rights Commission since its establishment has promoted, and
continues to promote, respect for human rights and a culture of human
rights, which was a scarce commodity years gone by. For detention without
trial and the deliberate annihilation of our women and the young was the
order of the day, all in the name of ``die swart gevaar''. [black peril.]
[The protection, development and attainment of human rights reigns supreme
in our country today, for the commission has gone a step further to
popularise the socioeconomic rights of our people. Yet the baseline
allocation to the commission has only increased by 18%, which translated to
an amount of R27 401 million in the 2002/2003 financial year. It is
interesting to note, however, that the Represented Political Parties Fund
is estimated at a staggering R66 653 million; the bulk of which is to
allocated to political parties whose mission of existence is nothing else
but to oppose. We ask: What is there to be opposed? Who, and on whose
behalf do you oppose?

The establishment of the Gender Commission was and continues to be to
promote respect for gender equality and the protection, development and
attainment of gender equality, in the living memory of Lilian Ngoyi, Helen
Joseph and Josephine Moshobane. Igama la makhosikazi malibongwe! [Praise
the name of the women!] Let us praise the names of those women.

In the speech entitled ``the revolution cannot triumph without emancipation
of women'', during the International Women's day celebrations in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, Colonel Thomas Sankara said and I quote:


  It is in this light that all of us, men and women, must define and affirm
  the role and place of women in society. Therefore we must restore to man
  his true image by making the reign of freedom prevail over
  differentiations imposed by nature and eliminating all kinds of hypocrisy
  that sustain the shameless exploitation of women.

In affirming and defining the role of an African woman in society, we, the
ANC, appointed a large number of women comrades to the role of Deputy
Ministers in the Government of the People of the Republic of South Africa.
[Applause.]

This, in the words of the late President of Mozambique, Comrade Samora
Machel, the erstwhile leader of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique:


  ... was not to be an act of charity, the result of a humanitarian or
  compassionate attitude but a fundamental necessity for the revolution,
  the guarantee of its continuity and precondition for its victory.

Yet we are told that the best remedy our country needs in strengthening
constitutional democracy is the building of a strong opposition and not the
affirmation of an African women in society. The promulgation of the
Employment Equity Act whose basic thrust is, amongst other things, to
elevate in the workplace designated groups which include African women, is
unfortunately interpreted by those whose mission of existence is nothing
else but to oppose, as apartheid in reverse and not consolidation of our
nascent democracy. How hard and tormenting it is.

We recently passed in this Parliament the Public Protector Amendment Bill
so as to further strengthen the office's ability to investigate complaints
lodged by the public against Government officials, agencies and employees.
This was done due to our firm belief that the office constitutes one of the
best ingredients in protecting societal interests, and hence the increase
in their budgetary allocations over a period of three years. Our commitment
to the pledge to strive together, sparing neither strength nor courage,
until the democratic changes set out in the Freedom Charter have been won,
is immeasurable.

The promulgation of the Public Financial Management Act by Parliament under
the leadership of the ANC was to further confer additional accounting
responsibilities in a systematic way to Government departments and the
parastatals, to report accordingly. Our ideal objective is to make this
Government of the people, by the people, for the people, to be accountable
to the people. [Applause.] Yet those who declared themselves a government-
in-waiting without the people's mandate launched a schating attack on the
Auditor-General, accusing him of bias, all in the name of opposition. What
is there to be opposed? On whose behalf do you oppose?

In the context of that which we continuously parade as a consolidation and
deepening of our people's power in pushing to the doldrums, the frontiers
of our poverty, what is there to be opposed? Who, and on whose behalf do
you oppose? Oppose the ANC we told for a powerful ANC is a threat to the
democratic dispensation. Who are the architects of this democracy? Oppose
the ANC, we are told. For a strong ANC in Parliament will legislate on
behalf of the ordinary, poor women of Ga-Dikgale in Limpopo. Who, and on
whose behalf are you opposing?

We are the architects of our constitutional democracy and a prosperous
future and declare to the world and our fellow country-men and women to
know that South Africa belongs to those who live in it - black and white -
and that it is only the Government which can justly claim authority. Which
government is that? It is the ANC Government as it is based on the will of
the people. Which ANC is it, South Africa, that you must oppose? A strong
ANC is a threat to a democratic dispensation. Loosely translated, you are
told that you must oppose your own will. On whose behalf do they oppose?

As we stand in this secured House of Parliament, we, the ANC, would want to
declare to all South Africans: That never, and never again, should it be
that the place of a woman is in the kitchen. Never, and never again, should
we believe that the ANC is a threat to the democracy, the democracy that
made it possible for the ANC to rule. It was the people themselves alone
who chose the ANC and the ANC alone to rule this country. Who, and on whose
behalf are you opposing the ANC? How hard and tormenting it is. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I
am honoured to be able to say that I am accompanied by a small deputation
from my clan; my elder brother uDumisani and his wife Margaret; my mother-
in-law who is a cousin of umNtwana wakwaPhindangene, our Minister of Home
Affairs, ... [Applause.] ... my cousin over there, Brian and his wife Mary
- there they are - and of course, my sister Ester, Mrs Bro Sy Ndaba; thank
you very much.

First and foremost, I must thank all the hon members - and `all' to me
means `all'- for what I think was a very interesting debate on the Justice
Budget Vote. We've had a very interesting afternoon and evening. Indeed, we
are eternally grateful to the members and we can assure those to whose
contributions we will not have the time to respond to that we shall, as a
cluster, respond appropriately to many of the observations they have made.
One interesting thing is that all the speakers, except the DA's speakers,
concluded that the situation is improving. The problems that we are
actually confronted with are not peculiarly South African. If I had time I
would give you some few quotations from the Prime Minister of the UK to
make hon members understand that in certain respects we may be doing better
than some of the most advanced and long - standing democracies. However, I
think, we should respond to some of the remarks made by some hon members.

The first one to respond to is the notion that the country is facing a
crisis because of certain remarks allegedly made by the chairperson of our
portfolio committee. Nothing is further from the truth. There is no crisis
in this country and there is no rift between my Government, my ANC and the
judiciary. There isn't any. And, it saddens some of us that it's hon
members in this House who come and stand here and suggest to people, who
require to be educated about the issues that we ought to debate and
address, that there is a crisis. There is absolutely no crisis at all.

The hon Delport says that the spirit of the Constitution is withering. You
know, it's interesting that he does not tell us what he measures the
withering spirit against. Because there was no spirit to measure it against
before 1994. Of course, the hon member wittingly or unwittingly tells the
truth, namely that he is completely opposed to the transformation of
society, though he is in support of whatever he means by affirmative
action. I think he has never been this honest. [Laughter.]

However, I want to say to the hon member - thanking him as I do, for his
honesty - it's unavoidable that transformation should be part and parcel of
the remaking this society. Because, if we don't, for God's sake, then
indeed the cleavage between the black and white and the rich and the poor
in this country is going to remain frozen at where it was prior to 1994.
Transformation is what this country desperately needs. [Interjections.]

Dr J T DELPORT: By discriminating against some.

THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: No! Please, we are
not discriminating against anybody.

When you say, for instance, that the land issue must be addressed. The
landless people out there would never sympathise with you when you say, for
God's sake, don't transform, don't touch land, leave it where it is - when
the people know how the land was taken away from the indigenous Africans in
this country. [Interjections.] Yes, so, we must! What we are saying, as
this House and institution, is that we need to pass appropriate legislation
in terms of and under which we shall then address these problems
systematically, legally, but address them!

Those who are opposed to transformation shall be reminded at the right hour
- next year when we go to the polls - that we know that they don't want
transformation, because they have ultimately been this honest. That is what
you were calling upon the masses of our people to fight back at. They won't
listen to you. [Interjections.]

Dr J T DELPORT: You are now being dishonest.

THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: The next one that
we need to respond to is the statement that was made, hopefully tongue-in-
cheek, by Koos Van der Merwe. Please, he did say that he doesn't support
transformation. [Interjections.] It's on the record. [Interjections.] He
did say that. [Interjections.]

In any event, he can only be supported by people like you. That's it.
People who have sold their souls completely. [Interjections.] [Applause.]
That's it! Let's come to this. [Interjections.] Man, you were found drunk
in a bus rank, man! That's how low you have stooped! [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] That's it.

Now, wait! Dereliction of duty is the crime [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Madam Speaker, [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:Order! Order!

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Madam Speaker, I would like to take  a  point  of  order.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  members,  listen  to  the  hon  member  ...
[Interjections.]
Mr G B D McINTOSH: Madam Speaker, would you please ask the Minister  to  sit
down so that I can put my point of order? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr G B D McINTOSH: Thank you, Deputy Speaker, the point  of  order  is  that
the Minister has just made an allegation against the  hon  member  Seremane,
which I believe reflects extremely seriously on  his  character.  I  believe
it's quite inappropriate in Parliament, and  coming  from  the  Minister  of
Justice it's doubly inappropriate. Would you please ask him to  withdraw  it
and apologise to the hon member? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  member,  I  don't  think  that  it  matters
whether he is a Minister of justice or whatever Minister. Hon  Minister,  it
was unkind and unparliamentary to say that an hon member  was  found  drunk.
Please do withdraw that.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: He was found sober
at a bus rank; I withdraw. [Laughter.] [Applause.] Now, Madam Speaker . . .
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Seremane, please let me deal with this
issue. [Interjections.] Hon Minister, just withdraw the remarks, please.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Deputy
Speaker, I reiterate that I have withdrawn the statement and I have said he
was found sober. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, please, I didn't ask you to make an
additional statement. I'm just asking you to withdraw. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Deputy
Speaker, wa tshega jaamrg. Ke kopa tshwarelo. [you are laughing now. I
apologise.] [Laughter.] I withdraw the statement. [Laughter.]

The next one that warrants a response  . . . [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Another point of
order now?

Mr W J SEREMANE: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, I haven't heard him
withdraw.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: He withdrew, hon member. [Interjections.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: I haven't heard him, I heard the last part which is
irrelevant, that I am laughing. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Seremane, he withdrew.

Mr W J SEREMANE: I also withdraw that you are a `com-tsotsi.'

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: By the way, he
called me a com-tsotsi, but he's now quietly withdrawn that.

The other one that warrants a response is the statement which hopefully hon
Koos van der Merwe made tongue-in-cheek, namely, that I was guilty of a
dereliction of duty because I did not protect the judges against Johnny de
Lange. I did say that if you know how the system works there is no Minister
who can actually call upon any member of this House to behave merely
because he is Minister. We are called by portfolio committees to account
for the way we run departments and it's in the interest of this democracy
that that be so.

The next one that warrants a response again, belongs to Ntate Mogoba, who's
just lost his position as PAC President to his then deputy. Ntate Mogoba,
you know, the President said that we should be able to give R30 000 to each
one of the victims identified by the TRC. They are victims of gross human
rights violations. And the President slowly says to all of us who were
listening to him here - and I hope you were, Ntate Mogoba - that this is
over and above everything else that we are doing as this Government and
society to help reconstruct the lives of our people that were ravaged by
the system of colonialism and its apartheid offshoot. Let's hope you
understood that.

The second part of your remarks is a reflection of your lack of
understanding, Ntate Mogoba, of why courts ruled that the Jews must be
paid. If you remember that only six million Jews died in the Second World
War and yet more than 50 million people died, it should strike you as not
being strange that the courts focused on the Jews. The money in the Swiss
banks belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Those were their assets,
which their heirs, for some reasons or the other, were not accessing,
unless and they got court injunctions to deal with that. So the facts are
totally different. It's also helpful to be able to articulate this so that
you don't mislead whoever listens to you out there.

The last set of remarks belongs to my usual friend, hon Sheila. The hon
Sheila says that the Chief Justice said 50% of crime goes unpunished.
[Interjections.] I can tell you, I suspect that she attended a different
meeting. [Interjections.] Yes, that's what I suspect; because I am advised
that the Chief Justice never said that. But the Chief Justice said that we
should actually strive - I'm paraphrasing him - to improve on the system in
its entirety so that people know that if they commit any crime there is
jail and they shall be arrested. He never said anything about the 50%.
Look, the Chief Justice doesn't behave in this way. He is a very decent
human being and you know it. [Laughter.]

The hon member also criticises the judiciary for slowness and things like
that. She is exacerbating whatever she means by the crisis, interestingly
enough, instead of helping the crisis to come to an end. But, again, I'd
say there is no crisis. What is also intriguing is that she attaches
significance to the fact that five of the six were black - and so what?
It's only a person who is deeply rooted and marinated in the politics of
apartheid and racism - honestly - marinated in that politics, that can
actually attach significance to race on a matter like this one. [Laughter.]

It does not matter whether or not they are black. There is an issue that we
have all been invited to debate and discuss, and that is, the
transformation of the institution as part of the transformation of our
society. That is the issue for us. Whatever positions or colour people are,
whatever race they belong to, the issue in front of us is transformation in
its entirety. [Interjections.]

Okusele lapho-ke asambeni siyodla, siphuze, sijabule; niyamenywa nonke.
[The last thing is let's go out and eat, drink and be happy, you are all
invited.] Thank you very much. [Applause.]
